The policy would take 2.5 million people out of paying higher-rate tax, more than reversing the increase over the past three decades, the tax and spending watchdog said. About three-quarters of the tax benefit would go to the highest-income 10% of households. Looking ahead to Treasury plans for a budget in November or possibly early December, depending on the timing of a general election, the IFS added that it would leave only 1.3 million, or fewer than 3% of adults, to pay a higher rate of tax. Sajid Javid has already committed the government to almost \u00a314bn of extra spending on the police, hospitals and schools following a Whitehall spending review. Johnson made the tax pledge during his Tory leadership campaign and it is expected to emerge as a central policy whenever the government sets a date for the budget. The thinktank said it was dismayed that the government appeared to be moving ahead with plans that would widen inequality and cost billions of pounds in extra borrowing. A plan to offset the effect of the handout to richer taxpayers in the form of an increase in the threshold for paying national insurance would be even more costly, the IFS said. Johnson said he wanted to raise the level at which workers start paying national insurance, though he did not specify by how much.

      "bodyText": "An influential investor group has told companies they must publish credible action plans that align executive pension pay with their workforce by 2022, or risk further shareholder revolts. The move could result in companies slashing bumper pension payouts for several executives, who pocket hundreds of thousands of pounds in cash retirement benefits every year. The Investment Association \u2013 which represents City firms with \u00a37.7tn in assets under management \u2013 said it will slap companies\u2019 annual reports with a \u201cred top\u201d or highest possible warning label if they fail to share concrete action plans to align executive pension pay with the majority of staff and continue to offer top bosses retirement benefits worth over 25% of salary. UK workers receive a pension worth, on average, about 10% of their pay, but that figure can be as low as 8% based on the latest auto-enrolment rules, and the bulk of it is paid by the workers themselves. Firms that offer a concrete plan but still pay pensions worth over 25% of salary to executives will be issued with an \u201camber top\u201d warning on their annual reports by the IA\u2019s Institutional Voting Information Service (Ivis). Those reports will then be shared with the IA\u2019s membership \u2013 comprised of more than 250 investment management firms \u2013 before each company\u2019s annual general meeting to inform their voting plans. Andrew Ninian, the IA\u2019s director of stewardship and corporate governance, said: \u201cOur new guidelines require companies to show they are serious about that ambition and set out a credible action plan to deliver it. \u201cCompanies with high executive pension payments who don\u2019t provide that plan risk facing further shareholder rebellions in their 2020 AGMs.\u201d UK companies including lender Standard Chartered and banknote printer De La Rue were among the companies hit with investor rebellions over their pension agreements this year. Nearly 40% of Standard Chartered shareholders refused to back the bank\u2019s remuneration policy in May, which included a \u00a3474,000 pension cash allowance for the chief executive, Bill Winters. Winters faced further controversy after saying that the shareholder protest \u2013 the largest revolt at the bank for five years \u2013 was \u201cimmature and unhelpful\u201d. The IA executive has already urged companies to bring executive pension pay below 25% of their salary, but is now ramping up the pressure by setting the two-year deadline for companies to comply with the UK corporate governance code.

Iran has already taken three separate calibrated steps away from the deal, and has warned it will take a fourth in November unless the US lifts economic sanctions. The warning to Iran, pre-agreed by the three EU signatories to the 2015 deal, was made at a meeting on Wednesday, and makes clear that the agreement is now on life support. The EU told Iran that it would put the issue of Iranian non-compliance into the agreement\u2019s formal dispute mechanism if the next Iranian move away from the deal is significant.

      "bodyText": "Babies living in areas with high levels of air pollution have a greater risk of death than those surrounded by cleaner air, a study has found. It is not the first study to investigate the link between air pollution and infant mortality , but thestudydrew particular focus on different pollutants and its analysis at different points in babies\u2019 lives. Dr Sarah Kotecha , a researcher at Cardiff University, said the results were difficult for pregnant women and their families to do much about. \u201cYou live where you live and you can\u2019t avoid pollution day in day out,\u201d she said, adding that it was down to policymakers to reduce pollution levels and for researchers to unpick how pollutants affect health. \u201cIf you can find out some of the mechanisms you can look at potential interventions,\u201d she added. A growing body of research has revealed links between different components of air pollution and health issues, including lung problems, heart disease, mental health problems, dementia and low birthweight. The latest study, yet to be peer-reviewed or published, will be presented at the European Respiratory Society international congress in Madrid. Kotecha said the research was based on data for almost 8 million live births in England and Wales between 2001 and 2012. The team divided England and Wales into 35,000 areas, each containing approximately 1,500 residents, and looked at the annual death rates for babies up to one-year-old, together with the average annual levels for three pollutants. These were particulate matter known as PM10, which comes from sources including vehicles and waste incineration, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulphur dioxide (SO2), which is released through burning of fossil fuels in power stations and refineries as well as metal extraction. For each pollutant the team compared the death rate for babies in the worst fifth of polluted areas with those in the best fifth. Once factors such as maternal age, deprivation level for the area and birthweight were taken into account, the team said that babies aged up to one year had a greater chance of dying living in areas with the worst air pollution compared with areas with the cleanest air. The results held across all three pollutants, with the odds of death 7% worse for NO2, 4% worse for PM10 and 19% worse for SO2. Further analysis suggested that of the three pollutants, only SO2 was associated with deaths within a baby\u2019s first 28 days. The study was unable to prove whether high levels of air pollution were to blame for the increased risk of death in those areas. It also did not take into account levels of indoor air pollution. Prof Mireille Toledano, an expert in population child health at Imperial College London, said the study confirmed that air pollution is a major public health hazard, adding that current standards are failing to protect people. She said the latest study had a number of limitations. It looked at average pollution levels over relatively large areas while in reality levels can vary greatly over a small distance \u2013 meaning the babies\u2019 true exposure was not captured. The study also did not take into account fluctuations in air pollution with the weather or over seasons, and did not take into account where the mother spent her pregnancy or factors such as maternal smoking. Toledano said it was also unclear how factors like birthweight were accounted for. \u201cIt is showing there is some kind of additional risk from air pollution for infant death but the way that it has been set up is quite a crude analysis,\u201d said Toledano. Dr Penny Woods, the chief executive of the British Lung Foundation, said action must be taken to tackle the public health crisis of air pollution \u2013 including introducing clean air zones in the most polluted cities. \u201cThe evidence linking infant mortality and air pollution is still emerging but Dr Kotecha\u2019s study, which suggests babies born in the UK\u2019s most polluted areas see a significantly increased risk of death, should be a wake-up call to government,\u201d she said. A second study found that exposure to PM10 from traffic during pregnancy and children\u2019s early life was linked to a slightly lower lung function of the children at eight years old \u2013 although the effect was no longer seen by the time the children were 15. Wood said the study mirrored previous findings, adding that children cannot protect their own lungs. \u201cBoth these studies concentrate on the damage done by air pollution to some of the most vulnerable members of our society \u2013 the very young,\u201d she said.",

      "body": "<p>You never really know someone, of course, until you\u2019re informed of their death caused by a pill-fuelled bout of auto-erotic asphyxiation with petrol in their bloodstream and a gadget in every orifice. Wealthily-married lady who lunches Simone (Sarah Kendall, the award-winning comedian who also wrote the show) learns this the hard way, when she is called to the hospital to identify her husband\u2019s body. \u201cWe\u2019d have called you sooner,\u201d says the doctor (Rufus Jones with his patented air of agony as a man caught in a dire situation not of his own making). \u201cBut we couldn\u2019t get the phone out.\u201d The action, by the way, is set in 1988, which makes both insertion and extraction of a mobile even more of a feat than it would be today. Respect all round.</p> <p>So begins Frayed, the new six-part series produced by Sharon Horgan\u2019s company Merman for Sky 1. It\u2019s billed as a comedy but for the opening episode \u2013 at least after Jones\u2019 and then Robert Webb\u2019s shining turn as the lawyer who informs Simone that her husband died insolvent \u2013 the gags thin out. This leaves a drama leavened by the blackly humorous moments that arise as the fan of life continues to spray what\u2019s recently hit it all over you.</p> <p>Her husband\u2019s lies cause Simone\u2019s own to be brought into the light. All the trappings of her gilded life in London \u2013 from yachts to mansion \u2013 are sold from under her. The children are withdrawn from private school and she must return with them to her mother and her childhood home in Australia.

      "bodyText": "You never really know someone, of course, until you\u2019re informed of their death caused by a pill-fuelled bout of auto-erotic asphyxiation with petrol in their bloodstream and a gadget in every orifice. Wealthily-married lady who lunches Simone (Sarah Kendall, the award-winning comedian who also wrote the show) learns this the hard way, when she is called to the hospital to identify her husband\u2019s body. \u201cWe\u2019d have called you sooner,\u201d says the doctor (Rufus Jones with his patented air of agony as a man caught in a dire situation not of his own making). \u201cBut we couldn\u2019t get the phone out.\u201d The action, by the way, is set in 1988, which makes both insertion and extraction of a mobile even more of a feat than it would be today. Respect all round. So begins Frayed, the new six-part series produced by Sharon Horgan\u2019s company Merman for Sky 1. It\u2019s billed as a comedy but for the opening episode \u2013 at least after Jones\u2019 and then Robert Webb\u2019s shining turn as the lawyer who informs Simone that her husband died insolvent \u2013 the gags thin out. This leaves a drama leavened by the blackly humorous moments that arise as the fan of life continues to spray what\u2019s recently hit it all over you. Her husband\u2019s lies cause Simone\u2019s own to be brought into the light. All the trappings of her gilded life in London \u2013 from yachts to mansion \u2013 are sold from under her. The children are withdrawn from private school and she must return with them to her mother and her childhood home in Australia. Which turns out not to be the spiral-staircased pile on a large farm she had claimed, nor in Sydney, but a deeply ordinary suburban home in depressed Newcastle, a three-hour drive away. Nor did her father die in a plane crash; he wandered into the ocean drunk and drowned. And she has a brother, Jim, whom she\u2019s never mentioned. And her real name is Samantha.

At least two of his claims were seriously misleading. Here are the key points </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson declined to apologise to the family of Jo Cox for his comments about her last night.</strong> His own sister, Rachel, said that what he said about Cox was \u201cparticularly tasteless\u201d. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/26/boris-johnsons-brexit-rhetoric-condemned-as-mps-tell-of-death-threats-politics-live?page=with:block-5d8cb10b8f081108db9bd33a#block-5d8cb10b8f081108db9bd33a\">1.56pm.)</a> But, when he was asked by BBC\u2019s Look North if he had a message for the Cox family, he replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Look, I want to make a very, very important point. There\u2019s a big big difference between a problem that I think is growing and that we need to deal with, which is the threat that MPs are facing, particularly female MPs [and it being important for MPs to be able to use words like surrender.]</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked again if he was sorry for his language in any way, Johnson said he was \u201cdeeply sorry for the threats that MPs face\u201d. But that was an expression of regret about something happening, not an apology for something for which he accepted some responsibility.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He rejected the suggestion that some of the language he had used last night might have contributed to MPs facing threats. </strong>When this was put to him, he said: \u201cI dispute that.\u201d</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He defended his right to call the Benn Act the \u201csurrender bill\u201d.</strong> In one interview he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If you look at the language I was using, it\u2019s important to be able to use a simple English word like surrender in a parliamentary context to describe a bill that gives the power to the rest of the EU to keep us locked in the EU by their own decision and to decide how long we should be there.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He falsely claimed that the Benn Act would give the EU the power to decide how long the UK stayed in the EU.</strong> In another interview he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>[The act] would take away the power of this government, and the power of this country to decide how long it would remain in the EU and give that power to the EU and that\u2019s really quite an extraordinary thing. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This is a claim that Johnson has made frequently, but it is not true. The act says, if the PM fails to pass a Brexit deal by 19 October, and if MPs have not voted for no deal, he must request a three-month extension. But it does not say the UK has to accept any length of extension it is offered by the EU.

Political parties make a huge amount of money from their party conferences, because members and lobbyists have to pay to attend (you can see the Tory charges <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://conservativepartyconference.com/files/pc2019/Pricing_Structure_v.pdf\">here - pdf)</a> and so it was always going to go ahead, regardless of what the supreme court decided on prorogation.</p> \n  <p>But the timetable may have to be rearranged. Boris Johnson was due to speak around lunchtime on Wednesday. Now he will be due in the Commons at that point, for PMQs, and so his speech is likely to be moved. For him to boycott the Commons and send, say, Dominic Raab in his place as a PMQs stand-in would be grossly disrespectful to parliament - although, on those grounds, the idea might appeal to Dominic Cummings. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, has told MPs he expects Boris Johnson to be in the house on Wednesday (see <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/26/boris-johnsons-brexit-rhetoric-condemned-as-mps-tell-of-death-threats-politics-live?page=with:block-5d8cc02f8f081108db9bd3cf#block-5d8cc02f8f081108db9bd3cf\">2.45pm)</a>, but in the current circumstances, that could easily change.</p> \n  <p>What is also not clear is whether or not the opposition, aka the \u201crebel alliance\u201d, will try to seize control of the Commons timetable next week to pass more anti-no-deal Brexit legislation. </p> \n  <p>Yesterday Labour whips offered the government a non-aggression pact, saying that as long as the Commons sat on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, they would be happy to debate non-contentious business (meaning there would be not need for a three-line whip, and most MPs would be able to go to Manchester). <a href=\"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/conservative-conference-manchester-cancellation-fears-16976862\">The conference is said to be worth \u00a330m to the Manchester economy,</a> and Labour did not want to take the blame for the city losing out. The government whips did not take up the offer, pushed for a recess instead, and lost the vote.</p> \n  <p>The business now tabled for Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday (see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/26/boris-johnsons-brexit-rhetoric-condemned-as-mps-tell-of-death-threats-politics-live?page=with:block-5d8cb8f08f08fbb0c171bebd#block-5d8cb8f08f08fbb0c171bebd\"> 2.13pm)</a> is non-contentious and in normal circumstances there would be no need for a three-line whip.

I am sure you would agree, Mr Speaker, that we should not resort to the use of offensive, dangerous or inflammatory language about legislation that we do not like.</p> \n   <p>We stand here, Mr Speaker, under the shield of our departed friend [Jo Cox].

When Johnson got to speak again, he continued:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Mr Speaker, let me just explain why I call it the surrender act. That is because it would oblige us to stay in the EU for month after month, at a cost of a billion pounds per month. It would take away from this country the ability to decide how long that extension would be, and it would give that power to the EU. It would absolutely undermine our ability to continue to negotiate properly in Brussels; it takes away the fundamental ability of a country to walk away from the negotiations, and I am afraid that is exactly what it does. If I may say so respectfully to opposition members who are getting very agitated about this, the best way to get rid of the surrender act is not to have voted for it in the first place, to repeal it, and to vote for the deal that we are going to do.

To have this debate descend into this bear pit of polarisation, I think it\u2019s dangerous for our country.\u201d</p> \n   <p>There is a willingness to jump out and decry the other side when they use language like \u2018surrender\u2019 or \u2018traitor\u2019 or \u2018betrayal\u2019. And I think that is inflammatory language. But as inflammatory are those people who have used the language of it being a \u2018coup\u2019 and \u2018dictatorship\u2019 and \u2018fascism\u2019. </p> \n   <p>I think both of those approaches are unacceptable. It is not just bad behaviour by one side of the debate. This is something which is infected our politics, and it\u2019s this vicious cycle where language gets more extreme, response gets more extreme, it all gets hyped up ... It creates an atmosphere where I think violence and attacks are more likely.</p> \n   <p>You can disagree passionately with people. But you don\u2019t have to impugn their motives, whether you are a hard Brexiteer or a hard remainer, actually, what you have in common is a desire to do what you think is best for the country. </p> \n   <p>What isn\u2019t acceptable is to demonize each other to build a culture of hatred to the other to create this tribal identity. Whatever happens with Brexit, the country is going to have to come together again. And we have to remember that, otherwise, we\u2019ll be building a toxic legacy.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-26T10:35:07.383Z\">at 11.35am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d8c53b08f08fbb0c171ba5b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-26T06:02:48.122Z\">7.02am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <h2>How the papers covered it</h2> \n  <p>The furious and dramatic scenes in Westminster <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/sep/26/man-with-no-shame-the-papers-on-boris-johnsons-performance-in-the-commons\">dominate the front pages on Thursday</a> as papers report on Boris Johnson\u2019s return to the House of Commons after his decision to suspend parliament was found to be unlawful.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DailyMirror/status/1176971546470035456\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Tomorrow's front page: Man with no shame <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TomorrowsPapersToday?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TomorrowsPapersToday</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/ykW5qPZ3yl\">https://t.co/ykW5qPZ3yl</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/j3IALb15tx\">pic.twitter.com/j3IALb15tx</a></p>\u2014 Daily Mirror (@DailyMirror) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DailyMirror/status/1176971546470035456?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 25, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/guardian/status/1176968185599410178\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The Guardian front page, Thursday 26 September 2019: MPs\u2019 fury as Johnson claims to speak for Britain on Brexit <a href=\"https://t.co/Pii28wJR3F\">pic.twitter.com/Pii28wJR3F</a></p>\u2014 The Guardian (@guardian) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardian/status/1176968185599410178?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 25, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DailyMailUK/status/1176970621806350336\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Thursday's <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DailyMailUK?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@DailyMailUK</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MailFrontPages?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#MailFrontPages</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/L3NlNUJI9M\">pic.twitter.com/L3NlNUJI9M</a></p>\u2014 Daily Mail U.K. (@DailyMailUK) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DailyMailUK/status/1176970621806350336?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 25, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MsHelicat/status/1176971542460272648\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Thursday\u2019s EXPRESS: Furious Boris: Brexit rebels face \u2018day of reckoning\u2019 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/tomorrowspaperstoday?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#tomorrowspaperstoday</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/JNjQTwAaki\">pic.twitter.com/JNjQTwAaki</a></p>\u2014 Helen Miller (@MsHelicat) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MsHelicat/status/1176971542460272648?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 25, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MsHelicat/status/1176973347269283840\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Thursday\u2019s TIMES: Commons hits boiling point <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/tomorrowspaperstoday?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#tomorrowspaperstoday</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/jYRzTM0HR3\">pic.twitter.com/jYRzTM0HR3</a></p>\u2014 Helen Miller (@MsHelicat) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MsHelicat/status/1176973347269283840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 25, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MsHelicat/status/1176966409559126017\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Thursday\u2019s TELEGRAPH;

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re going to close down this live blog now. Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s events: The prime minister faced widespread criticism over his refusal to apologise for his provocative comments; including those he made about the murdered MP, Jo Cox. Some of the staunchest criticism came from Johnson\u2019s own sister, Rachel, who accused him of deploying \u201chighly reprehensible language\u201d. But Johnson insisted he would continue to use the rhetoric of war when referring to Brexit. The prime minister said he had every right to call the Benn Act the \u201csurrender bill\u201d, despite MPs\u2019 complaints such action was emboldening those who might harm them and their families. Nigel Farage sided with Johnson on the issue. The prime minister\u2019s senior aide, Dominic Cummings, suggested that only carrying out Brexit would calm tensions, as MPs complained of facing death threats. Cummings shrugged off the concerns of such one MP, telling him: \u201cGet Brexit done.\u201d And he legitimised the \u201canger\u201d being directed at MPs, saying it was not surprising because the Brexit process was still dragging on. A man was arrested trying to smash windows at Jess Phillips\u2019 constituency office, the Labour MP said. The man was shouting that she was a fascist and her staff had to be locked inside, Phillips told LBC radio. She also complained about the prime minister\u2019s rhetoric. MPs refused to schedule a mini-recess for the Tory party conference. A No 10 spokesman later insisted the conference would go ahead. Opposition parties agreed to explore ways to censure Johnson in parliament. And they agreed to renew efforts to block the UK leaving the European Union without a deal. And you can read yet more from my colleague, Rowena Mason, who has the full story: Cummings has also said serious threats of violence have been seen on both sides, adding that the \u201csituation can only be resolved by parliament honouring its promise to respect the result\u201d of the 2016 referendum. People on all sides have said things that veered between unwise and very unpleasant, and sometimes criminal. That is true of people of the leave side and that\u2019s true of people on the remain side. People have been running around during the referendum campaign saying I was a Nazi, they run around for three years afterwards saying I am a criminal, and now a criminal Nazi. And there are also a bunch of people on the Leave side who have said terrible things about remainers. I also think there is a very important distinction between, on the one hand, a robust political discussion and debate, and threats of violence. Threats of violence are a completely different matter. They should be treated in a completely different matter; everyone should take those extremely seriously. I know people on both sides of leave and remain who have had serious threats like that and it is obviously bad. In the end, the situation can only be resolved by parliament honouring its promise to respect the result. According to the Press Association, Cummings added: I don\u2019t think anyone is going to listen to reason because a lot of people (MPs) become really badly disconnected from what people in the real world and England outside central London thinks. Dominic Cummings has been addressing the language used in the Brexit debate and the threats sent to some MPs this evening. The Press Association reports that he has said it is \u201cnot surprising\u201d people are angry with parliamentarians. He\u2019s appearing at an event marking the launch of a new book by the Vote Leave supporter and businessman, Stuart Wheeler. Asked if he blamed MPs for the abuse they were getting, he has said: The MPs said we will have a referendum, we will respect the result and then they spent three years swerving all over the shop. It is not surprising some people are angry about it. I find it very odd that these characters are complaining that people are unhappy about their behaviour now and they also say they want a referendum. How does that compute for them? To me, it says that, fundamentally, a lot of people in parliament are more out of touch with the country now than they were in summer 2016. If you are a bunch of politicians and say that we swear we are going to respect the result of a democratic vote, and then after you lose you say, we don\u2019t want to respect that vote, what do you expect to happen? Asked directly if he believed MPs have themselves to blame for the abuse they are receiving, Cummings said: \u201cThat\u2019s the way you\u2019re putting it. I am using my language.\u201d Major also offers some pretty strong criticism of Johnson and his cabinet over their approach to Brexit and their use of language: Like many in my party, who have been expelled for voting with their conscience, I am a lifelong Conservative. I hope our millions of traditional, moderate, middle-of-the-road supporters understand that this Conservative government\u2019s present position is an aberration. Most Conservatives are not a Brexit party tribute band, nor have we abandoned our core values to find compromise, seek allies and strive for unity, rather than division and disarray. We do not believe we have the right to ignore the voices of millions of others, whose opinions differ from our own. And we abhor the language of division and hate \u2013 and words such as \u201csaboteur\u201d, \u201ctraitor\u201d, \u201cenemy\u201d, \u201csurrender\u201d, \u201cbetrayal\u201d have no place in our party, our politics, nor in our society. It is emphatically not who we are as a people. And must never be seen as so. I hope that the Conservative parliamentary party will regain its sense of balance, and rein in the faction of a faction that now prevails in cabinet. Boris Johnson may use the privy council to bypass the legal requirement on him to seek a three-month Brexit delay if he cannot get a deal, the former prime minister John Major has suggested. In a speech to the Centre for European Reform thinktank this evening, Major plans to say: My fear is that the government will seek to bypass statute law, by passing an order of council to suspend the [Benn] Act until after 31 October. It is important to note that an order of council can be passed by privy councillors \u2013 that is government ministers \u2013 without involving HM the Queen. I should warn the prime minister that \u2013 if this route is taken \u2013 it will be in flagrant defiance of parliament and utterly disrespectful to the supreme court. It would be a piece of political chicanery that no one should ever forgive or forget. Major is referring to the difference between an order in council, which needs the approval of the monarch, and an order of council, which does not. Johnson has repeatedly made the apparently contradictory claims that he will, at once, abide by the law and refuse to ask for a delay. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has criticised the prime minister over his inflammatory language, making reference as he did so to the arrest at the constituency offices of his party colleague, Jess Phillips: Footage has emerged of the senior No 10 aide responding to an MP\u2019s concerns about death threats with the words: \u201cGet Brexit done\u201d. Karl Turner, the Labour MP for Hull East and a shadow minister, confronted Dominic Cummings in Westminster today. Footage of the incident, posted online by the BBC, showed Turner criticising the prime minister\u2019s inflammatory tone and telling Cummings: \u201cI\u2019ve had death threats overnight; \u2018should be dead\u2019.\u201d Cummings responds: \u201cGet Brexit done.\u201d Speaking to the Press Association about the exchange later, Turner said: My wife is in Hull with my three-year-old daughter while I\u2019m in Westminster \u2013 I take threats seriously. I saw Dominic Cummings in Portcullis House and I raised with him that the language adopted by the prime minister and others yesterday is inflammatory and causing MPs to receive death threats. Mr Cummings responded to me: \u2018Back a deal, then\u2019. I then approached him and said, how is it possible for me to be criticised for not backing a deal? I\u2019ve tried three times to back the former prime minister\u2019s deal but it wasn\u2019t good enough for me to support. The PM should be in Brussels negotiating a deal to bring back to parliament so people like me can support it. I\u2019m desperate to support a deal but it must protect jobs and workers\u2019 rights. Turner has said he\u2019s \u201ctruly worried\u201d about his family\u2019s safety, having previously had a person arrive at his house in Hull to confront him. The reason I was provoked into making an impassioned plea for him to stop allowing the tone of the debate to be as it is, is because I am truly worried about my family,\u201d he said. I\u2019ve had previous experiences of attacks on the house and the family and you can\u2019t decide when you see these threats whether it is a serious death threat or whether it is just someone firing off at the keyboard when they\u2019ve had too much to drink. I don\u2019t know and it worries me. Boris Johnson has recorded a series of regional TV interviews today, and the BBC has released some of the transcripts. At least two of his claims were seriously misleading. Here are the key points Johnson declined to apologise to the family of Jo Cox for his comments about her last night. His own sister, Rachel, said that what he said about Cox was \u201cparticularly tasteless\u201d. (See 1.56pm.) But, when he was asked by BBC\u2019s Look North if he had a message for the Cox family, he replied: Look, I want to make a very, very important point. There\u2019s a big big difference between a problem that I think is growing and that we need to deal with, which is the threat that MPs are facing, particularly female MPs [and it being important for MPs to be able to use words like surrender.] Asked again if he was sorry for his language in any way, Johnson said he was \u201cdeeply sorry for the threats that MPs face\u201d. But that was an expression of regret about something happening, not an apology for something for which he accepted some responsibility. He rejected the suggestion that some of the language he had used last night might have contributed to MPs facing threats. When this was put to him, he said: \u201cI dispute that.\u201d He defended his right to call the Benn Act the \u201csurrender bill\u201d. In one interview he said: If you look at the language I was using, it\u2019s important to be able to use a simple English word like surrender in a parliamentary context to describe a bill that gives the power to the rest of the EU to keep us locked in the EU by their own decision and to decide how long we should be there. He falsely claimed that the Benn Act would give the EU the power to decide how long the UK stayed in the EU. In another interview he said: [The act] would take away the power of this government, and the power of this country to decide how long it would remain in the EU and give that power to the EU and that\u2019s really quite an extraordinary thing. This is a claim that Johnson has made frequently, but it is not true. The act says, if the PM fails to pass a Brexit deal by 19 October, and if MPs have not voted for no deal, he must request a three-month extension. But it does not say the UK has to accept any length of extension it is offered by the EU. If the EU did offer a longer or shorter extension, under the legislation the PM could either accept it, or refer it to the Commons for MPs to decide. So the UK would have a choice. He claimed that he had not talked about \u201cbetrayal\u201d in the Commons - even though he said in his opening statement: \u201cWe will not betray the people who sent us here; we will not.\u201d When it was put to him that he had used words like betrayal, he said: I don\u2019t think I did say anything about a betrayal. What I worry about is if we don\u2019t get Brexit done, then people will feel very badly let down. He claimed that some of the things opposition MPs were shouting at him in the Commons last night were \u201cfar harsher\u201d than what he said. He said there was a need for \u201ctempers ... to come down\u201d in the Commons. In response to another question about his language, he said: You\u2019re right, tempers need to come down, and people need to come together because it\u2019s only by getting Brexit done that you\u2019ll lance the boil, as it were, of the current anxiety and we will be able to get on with the domestic agenda. He said he accepted the need to \u201creach out across the House of Commons\u201d to get Brexit done. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is taking over now. The opposition parties are going to meet again on Monday to consider \u201call parliamentary mechanisms to stop a no-deal [Brexit]\u201d, the Labour party has said. In a statement about this afternoon\u2019s talks, Labour said the parties agreed that stopping a no-deal Brexit was a priority and that the language used by the PM was unacceptable. The parties agreed that \u201cany election without a lock preventing no deal would not get through parliament\u201d. And Labour made it clear that \u201cit wants an election as soon there\u2019s a lock against no deal\u201d. The meeting was attended by Jeremy Corbyn, John McDonnell, Valerie Vaz and Shami Chakrabarti from Labour, Ian Blackford from the SNP, Jo Swinson from the Lib Dems, Anna Soubry from the Independent Group for Change, Caroline Lucas from the Green and Liz Saville Roberts from Plaid Cymru. UPDATE: I\u2019ve corrected the final paragraph. It was Liz Saville Roberts representing Plaid Cymru, not Leanne Wood (the former Plaid leader). The original mistake was in the Labour briefing. Liz Saville Roberts, the Plaid Cymru leader, also told Sky News that at the meeting with other opposition party leaders it was agreed that she would investigate what might be done to impeach or censure Boris Johnson in the Commons. She said: How do we bring it back to the chamber here in this place that the truth matters and conduct matters and the sort of words that you use in politics, those matter too. So I hope that we will find a way of censuring the prime minister. That\u2019s what I raised with the leaders of the opposition parties today. And we will be looking together at how to take that forward. Opposition party leaders have finished their meeting where they discussed what more might be done to stop a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. Jeremy Corbyn spoke with the SNP\u2019s Ian Blackford, the Lib Dems\u2019 Jo Swinson, the Independent Group for Change\u2019s Anna Soubry and Plaid Cymru\u2019s Liz Saville Roberts. According to the Press Association, Swinson left the talks early to speak to police about a threat made against one of her young children. After the meeting Saville Roberts said they had spoken about how to ensure that Boris Johnson complied with the Benn Act, which will require the PM to request a Brexit extension if no deal has been agreed by 19 October. She said: We have got to get the Benn Act extension and we have to make sure that actually happens. There are a lot of pressures on, but that overrides everything. Here is the Labour MP Jess Phillips talking about the man who tried to break into her constituency office. The government motion saying the conference recess should go ahead next week was backed by 275 Conservative MPs, nine DUP MPs and five independents. Three of them were Tories who lost the whip after rebelling over Brexit earlier this month (Steve Brine, Greg Clark and Caroline Nokes), another was the Tory Charlie Elphicke, who is suspended over a court case, and the other was the former Labour MP Ian Austin. Fifteen independent MPs joined the opposition parties and voted against the government. They included seven of the 21 Tories who had the whip withdrawn over Brexit earlier this month: Guto Bebb, Ken Clarke, David Gauke, Justine Greening, Dominic Grieve, Anne Milton and Antoinette Sandbach. Another was Amber Rudd, who resigned the whip herself in solidarity with the 21. Another 10 of the 21 who lost the whip did not vote. They were Richard Benyon, Alistair Burt, Philip Hammond, Stephen Hammond, Richard Harrington, Margot James, Sir Oliver Letwin, Sir Nicholas Soames, Rory Stewart and Ed Vaizey. The other member the group of 21 rebels was Sam Gyimah. He is now a Liberal Democrat, and voted against the motion with his new party. The Labour MP Jess Phillips, who represents Birmingham Yardley, has revealed that a man has been arrested after trying to \u201ckick the door\u201d of her constituency office while reportedly shouting that she was a fascist. She told LBC Radio: I\u2019ve only just heard about it myself but my staff had to be locked into my office while the man tried to smash the windows and kick the door, I believe. I don\u2019t know what I can say because the man has been arrested. According to HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh, Boris Johnson is planning to go ahead with his speech to the Tory conference on Wednesday \u2013 even though PMQs is scheduled. If Johnson does skip PMQs, that would be seen as a gross discourtesy to the Commons. Earlier I speculated that he might send Dominic Raab in his place (see 3.13pm), but given the state of relations between No 10 and the Commons he might even palm MPs off with Kevin Foster, the junior Welsh Office minister and interim Cabinet Office minister who responded to the UQ about Johnson\u2019s language today. From the BBC\u2019s Chris Mason Here are various accounts of an incident in the voting lobbies this afternoon. From Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby From the Tory MP Nadine Dorries, a Boris Johnson supporter From Labour\u2019s Jess Phillips UPDATE: Here is another witness, the Tory MP Claire Perry The Conservative party is expected to clarify later what impact the decision not to have a mini-recess next week will have on its party conference. James Cleverly, the chairman, has already said it is not going to be cancelled. Political parties make a huge amount of money from their party conferences, because members and lobbyists have to pay to attend (you can see the Tory charges here - pdf) and so it was always going to go ahead, regardless of what the supreme court decided on prorogation. But the timetable may have to be rearranged. Boris Johnson was due to speak around lunchtime on Wednesday. Now he will be due in the Commons at that point, for PMQs, and so his speech is likely to be moved. For him to boycott the Commons and send, say, Dominic Raab in his place as a PMQs stand-in would be grossly disrespectful to parliament - although, on those grounds, the idea might appeal to Dominic Cummings. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, has told MPs he expects Boris Johnson to be in the house on Wednesday (see 2.45pm), but in the current circumstances, that could easily change. What is also not clear is whether or not the opposition, aka the \u201crebel alliance\u201d, will try to seize control of the Commons timetable next week to pass more anti-no-deal Brexit legislation. Yesterday Labour whips offered the government a non-aggression pact, saying that as long as the Commons sat on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, they would be happy to debate non-contentious business (meaning there would be not need for a three-line whip, and most MPs would be able to go to Manchester). The conference is said to be worth \u00a330m to the Manchester economy, and Labour did not want to take the blame for the city losing out. The government whips did not take up the offer, pushed for a recess instead, and lost the vote. The business now tabled for Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday (see 2.13pm) is non-contentious and in normal circumstances there would be no need for a three-line whip. But does the non-aggression offer still hold? Probably not. That offer was made before Boris Johnson spent three hours in the Commons disrespecting the memory of Jo Cox and using language seen as \u201cinciting hatred towards MPs\u201d. (See 10.50am.) As my colleague Rowena Mason reports, opposition parties are meeting now to discuss what they will do next week. There is no reason to think they won\u2019t want to do all they can disrupt next week for the government. If the opposition does try to use next week to pass emergency legislation to firm up the Benn Act, then the government will want its MPs in London on a three-line whip. If that is the case, the Tory conference can still go ahead, but a lot of fringe events might look a bit empty. Jacob Rees-Mogg has told MPs that he expects Sajid Javid to be in the Commons on Tuesday for Treasury questions, and Boris Johnson to be there on Wednesday, for PMQs, the Independent\u2019s John Rentoul reports. Valerie Vaz, the shadow leader of the Commons, asks whether Rees-Mogg can arrange for Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, to apologise to the Commons for calling it \u201cdead\u201d. She says Rees-Mogg himself should also apologise to the doctor he criticised, David Nicholl. She asks Rees-Mogg to explain why he reportedly called the supreme court judgment at cabinet a \u201cconstitutional coup\u201d. And she asks how long a prorogation would need to be before a Queen\u2019s speech. Rees-Mogg says he would not describe parliament as dead himself. He would describe it as addled, like the 1614 parliament. He says he is happy to repeat the apology to Nicholl he has already given. On the \u201cconstitutional coup\u201d comment, Rees-Mogg says cabinet minutes are revealed after 30 years. He tells Vaz: \u201cJust because newspapers print gossip from cabinet meetings does not make it fact.\u201d (Actually, the 30-year rule is becoming a 20-year rule.) On prorogation, he says it does not take much time at all to get the Commons ready for the state opening of parliament. But quite a lot of changes have to be made in the Lords, he says. And he says before the ceremony the \u201cunsightly barriers\u201d outside the Houses of Parliament which are there for security purposes have to be removed. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, delivers a business statement for next week. On Monday MPs will hold debates on Northern Ireland under the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation) Act. On Tuesday they will vote on various statutory instruments. On Wednesday MPs will debate the second reading of the domestic abuse bill. And on Thursday there will be a general debate on women\u2019s mental health, and on MoJ spending. Richard Burgon, the shadow justice secretary, is making a point of order. He says the Commons library has confirmed to him today that the soonest an election could take place would be Tuesday 5 November. This would be after the 31 October deadline for Brexit, he says. He asks the Speaker, John Bercow, to confirm this. Burgon says he think it is important for the public to understand that, even if Labour backed an election now, it could not take place before the PM\u2019s deadline for Brexit. Bercow confirms that this is his understanding of the rules. Boris Johnson has suffered another Commons defeat. MPs have voted down the government motion for a mini-recess next week during the Tory conference by 306 votes to 289 \u2013 a majority of 17. The BBC\u2019s Europe editor, Katya Adler, has posted a good thread on Twitter about the latest thinking within the EU as to what will happen with Brexit. She says EU sources think the chances of a deal at the October summit are now \u201cpretty much nil\u201d. Here are the first two tweets, but it is worth reading the whole thing (which you can do by clicking on the first post). MPs are now voting on whether to have a mini-recess for the Tory conference. There has been no debate. After a statement on climate change, they went straight into a vote on a government business motion saying the house should rise today and return next Thursday. The Tory conference in Manchester starts on Sunday, and is due to finish on Wednesday. Dismissing concerns that incendiary language can contribute to the culture leading to MPs getting death threats and Jo Cox being murdered as \u201chumbug\u201d (see 1.15pm) was probably the most provocative thing that Boris Johnson said last night. But another jaw-dropping moment came when he said: \u201cThe best way to honour the memory of Jo Cox, and indeed to bring this country together, would be, I think, to get Brexit done.\u201d Cox, of course, was passionately anti-Brexit. She was killed by a far-right terrorist motivated by hatred for people he referred to as \u201ccollaborators\u201d and \u201ctraitors\u201d. Rachel Johnson, the prime minister\u2019s sister, has joined those condemning the PM for his language, and on Sky she singled out this comment for particular criticism. She said: I do think it was particularly tasteless for those grieving a mother, MP and friend to say the best way to honour her memory is to deliver the thing she and her family campaigned against. I think it was a very tasteless way of referring to the memory of a murdered MP, murdered by someone who said \u201cBritain first\u201d, of the far right tendency, which you could argue is being whipped up by this sort of language. In an interview with Sky, Rachel Johnson also criticised her brother\u2019s language generally. My brother is using words like surrender and capitulation as if the people standing in the way of the blessed will of the people as defined by 17.4m votes in 2016 should be hung, drawn, quartered, tarred and feathered. I think that is highly reprehensible language to use. Although close to her brother, Rachel Johnson has never agreed with him on Brexit. She voted remain, joined the Lib Dems after the referendum, and then switched to Change UK, who adopted her as a candidate during the European elections. Like all the Change UK candidates, she failed to get elected. Here is a fuller version of what the Labour MP Jess Phillips said when she asked her urgent question about Boris Johnson\u2019s language. (See 12.11pm.) She said: The use of language yesterday and over the past few weeks such as the surrender bill, such as invoking the war, such as betrayal and treachery, it has clearly been tested, and workshopped and worked up and entirely designed to inflame hatred and division. I get it, it works, it is working. It is not sincere, it is totally planned, it is completely and utterly a strategy designed by somebody to harm and cause hatred in our country. When I hear of my friend Jo Cox\u2019s murder and the way that it has made me and my colleagues feel, and feel scared, described as humbug (see 1.15pm), I actually don\u2019t feel anger towards the prime minister, I feel pity for those of you who have to toe his line. The people opposite me know how appalling it was to describe the murder of my friend as mere humbug. I want to ask the prime minister to apologise and to tell him that the bravest, strongest thing to say is sorry - it will make him look good, it will not upset the people who want Brexit in this country if he acts for once like a statesman. Calling me names, putting words in my mouth and in the mouth of my dead friend makes me cross and angry, it makes me scared even, but I will not react, the prime minister wants me to react so I join in the chaos that keeps this hatred and fear on our streets. I simply ask the minister to request the prime minister, who\u2019s notable by his bravery today, I ask him to ask the prime minister to meet with me in private with his advisers and some of his colleagues, and my friends from Jo\u2019s family so we can explain our grief and try to make him understand why it is so abhorrent that he has chosen a strategy to divide rather than to lead. Boris Johnson said many provocative things during his long statement to the Commons last night, but his most incendiary answer was probably the one he gave in response to a question from Labour\u2019s Paula Sherriff. Jeremy Corbyn referred to it directly in his statement. (See 12.59pm.) For the record, here is Sherriff\u2019s question, and Johnson\u2019s answer, in full. Sherriff asked: I genuinely do not seek to stifle robust debate, but this evening the prime minister has continually used pejorative language to describe an act of parliament that was passed by this house. I am sure you would agree, Mr Speaker, that we should not resort to the use of offensive, dangerous or inflammatory language about legislation that we do not like. We stand here, Mr Speaker, under the shield of our departed friend [Jo Cox]. Many of us in this place are subject to death threats and abuse every single day. Let me tell the prime minister that they often quote his words \u2013 surrender act, betrayal, traitor \u2013 and I, for one, am sick of it. We must moderate our language, and that has to come from the prime minister first, so I should be interested in hearing his opinion. He should be absolutely ashamed of himself. Johnson replied: I have to say that I have never heard such humbug in all my life. The reality is that this is a bill ... At that point there was so much uproar that the Speaker had to intervene. When Johnson got to speak again, he continued: Mr Speaker, let me just explain why I call it the surrender act. That is because it would oblige us to stay in the EU for month after month, at a cost of a billion pounds per month. It would take away from this country the ability to decide how long that extension would be, and it would give that power to the EU. It would absolutely undermine our ability to continue to negotiate properly in Brussels; it takes away the fundamental ability of a country to walk away from the negotiations, and I am afraid that is exactly what it does. If I may say so respectfully to opposition members who are getting very agitated about this, the best way to get rid of the surrender act is not to have voted for it in the first place, to repeal it, and to vote for the deal that we are going to do. That is the way forward. If you want to read the all the exchanges, the Hansard is available here. But it is a long read; the exchanges lasted for more than three hours. David Gauke, the former Tory justice secretary, who now sits as an independent having had the whip removed over a Brexit rebellion, says at best what Boris Johnson said last night could be described as \u201cdeeply insensitive\u201d. But Gauke says what he is concerned about is that the government is deliberately pursuing a strategy intended to entrench division. He asks the minister to confirm that this is not government policy. Foster says the Tories will go into the next election committed to uniting the country. Here is an extract from Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s statement at the start of this UQ. (See 12.24pm.) Corbyn said: It\u2019s extremely disappointing that the prime minister has not respected this house by attending here today. The prime minister\u2019s language and demeanour yesterday was frankly nothing short of disgraceful. Three years ago our colleague, our member, Jo Cox, was murdered by a far-right activist shouting: \u2018Britain First, this is for Britain.\u2019 The language that politicians use matters and has real consequences. To dismiss concerns from members about the death threats they receive and to dismiss concerns that the language by the prime minister is being repeated in those death threats is reprehensible. To dismiss those concerns in an abusive way as he did is completely unacceptable ... I\u2019ve written to all members of the parliamentary Labour party expressing my solidarity to my friends and set out the conduct expected of all colleagues. No side of this house, as you\u2019ve said Mr Speaker, has a monopoly of virtue. Inappropriate language has been used by all sides. But we all have a duty to keep our debates political and not to descend into personal abuse. Labour\u2019s Paula Sherriff says she asked Boris Johnson to moderate his language last night. She says she accepts that in the past she has heckled ministers loudly. She says she was horrified to see this tweet from the Tory MP Simon Clarke after her intervention last night. She says she would not refer to Clarke as honourable. She asks the Cabinet Office minster Kevin Foster if the government supports this. Foster says that the government wants MPs to moderate their language, but he does not comment on Clarke\u2019s tweet. The Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge tells MPs that, when she came into the Commons last night, she felt as if she was attending a meeting of the Bullingdon Club. The Lib Dem MP Luciana Berger says, as someone who has seen six people convicted for hate crimes directed at her, she wants Boris Johnson to tone down his inflammatory language. Kevin Foster tells Berger that her party campaigned on the slogan \u201cbollocks to Brexit\u201d. More on the 1922 Committee meeting. This is from the FT\u2019s Jim Pickard. Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader, tells the Commons that he never saw David Cameron use the sort of language Boris Johnson did yesterday. He says talking about \u201csurrender\u201d implies we are at war with Europe. But we are not at war with Europe and we are not at war with each other, he says. He says this language is intended to cause division. Some people say this strategy will work. I say this strategy will not work because the British people are better than this. Justine Greening, a former Tory cabinet minister who now sits as an independent, having had the whip removed, tells the Commons she was shocked by the language Boris Johnson used yesterday. She says she thinks there is a \u201cdeliberate race to the bottom\u201d in British politics now, that disadvantages MPs who are not prepared to go along with it. Here is more from what Boris Johnson told Conservative backbenchers at his private meeting with the 1922 Committee. From my colleague Rowena Mason From HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh From Mail Online\u2019s David Wilcock Jeremy Corbyn is speaking on this topic for Labour. He says it is \u201cextremely disappointing\u201d that Boris Johnson is not here himself to answer the UQ. Johnson\u2019s language last night was \u201cnothing short of disgraceful\u201d, Corbyn says. He says the way Johnson dismissed concerns about the murder of Jo Cox and the role language can play in inciting attacks like that was \u201creprehensible\u201d and \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d. Corbyn says Johnson was trying to \u201centrench divisions\u201d. He urges the PM to apologise. Johnson\u2019s language \u201cfell well below the standards expected by the people of this country\u201d, Corbyn says. Corbyn says Boris Johnson should apologise for his \u201creprehensible\u201d comments about threats to MPs yesterday. The Tory MP Maria Miller questions the appropriateness of Jess Phillips raising this point. She says that during last night\u2019s statement Phillips herself was one of the Labour MPs shouting the loudest at Johnson. Foster is responding to Phillips. He says he does not consider anyone in the Commons as a traitor. He says, as the minister responsible for the government\u2019s \u201cdefending democracy\u201d programme, he would be happy to meet Phillips. He repeats the points he made earlier about how the government is trying to increase security for election candidates. Ultimately it is for everyone to think about the language they use, he says. He says the government wants to respond with \u201ccalm dignity\u201d and to create a safe environment for all. He does not say whether the PM himself will be willing to meet Phillips, and he does not comment on Johnson\u2019s language. Jess Phillips is speaking now. She says the language used by Boris Johnson last night was \u201cclearly designed to inflate hatred\u201d. She says she was appalled to hear him describe a reference to the murder of Jo Cox as \u201chumbug\u201d. Johnson should apologise, she says. She asks the minister Kevin Foster whether the PM will be willing to meet her, and some of Cox\u2019s friends and families, so that they can tell him how hurt they were by his language. John Bercow, the Speaker, is making a statement in the Commons. He says in light of the \u201cappalling atmosphere in the chamber yesterday and the toxicity that it can spawn or exacerbate in the country at large\u201d he has granted an urgent question. The Labour MP Jess Phillips wants a statement on whether the PM will reflect on the language used by MPs. She wanted Boris Johnson to answer, but instead the junior Cabinet Office minister Kevin Foster is replying. Foster says the government understands the importance of language. He says it is going to make intimidating election candidates an offence. And he says the police have been reviewing security for MPs. He does not say anything about the language used by Boris Johnson yesterday. The Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, will travel to Brussels on Friday for a meeting with Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Downing Street has said. But the PM\u2019s spokesman has also said that although progress has been made in negotiations with Brussels, \u201cthere are significant obstacles remaining to concluding a deal\u201d. From my colleague Matthew Weaver From the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth The European commission has joined those reprimanding Boris Johnson for the language he used in the Commons last night about his opponent. This is what the commission\u2019s spokeswoman, Mina Andreeva, said on the subject. We would remind everybody that respect is a fundamental value in all democracies. It is the responsibility of each and every politician to uphold our values. History has shown us what happens when they are not respected. Boris Johnson is addressing the backbench Conservative 1922 Committee. These are from some of the journalists doorstepping the meeting. In the Commons, in response to an urgent question, Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, has admitted that the government has made further breaches of the court ruling banning arms sales to Saudia Arabia that could be used in Yemen, my colleague Dan Sabbagh reports. Jo Cox\u2019s sister, Kim Leadbeater, has joined Cox\u2019s husband (see 7.45am) in expressing alarm about the language used by Boris Johnson in the Commons last night. Leadbeater told Sky News: I watched parliament TV for four hours last night and I was mesmerised and dumbstruck by the scenes that I saw before me. I think the prime minister needs to think very carefully about the language he uses. I think everybody has to think really carefully about the language they use. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, has defended Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to use terms such as surrender and betrayal in the Brexit context. The argument against such language is that it is inflammatory because it frames Brexit, an issue that is supposed to be about a trading relationships with friendly countries, in terms of warfare, with the EU depicted as an enemy power. The Tory MP Simon Hoare has called for a change of tone from Boris Johnson. Hoare, who voted remain in 2016, told the Commons: There needs to a change in the mood music emanating from No 10 because as a Tory party we obey the rule of law and the fact that is in question in this place should bring shame on all of us. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, picking up from Matthew Weaver. One consequence of Boris Johnson\u2019s extraordinary provocative and divisive performance in the Commons last night is that it has made it much, much harder to see how any opposition MPs could vote with him for a Brexit deal in the next few weeks. It is hard to know whether he is even at all serious about trying to get an agreement through the Commons. This has just been confirmed in the chamber by Labour\u2019s Lisa Nandy, one of the opposition MPs who has been trying to drum up support for a cross-party deal. Condemning Johnson\u2019s \u201chorrendous, divisive language\u201d, she said: For those of us who do want to work cross-party to achieve a deal, this is making it much, much more difficult. The Labour MP Paula Sherriff has accused the prime minister of inciting hatred against MPs. Speaking to the BBC\u2019s Victoria Derbyshire programme she said she was horrified by Boris Johnson\u2019s dismissal of her concerns about threats to MPs as \u201chumbug\u201d. Sherriff said: We talk about it in the tearooms. People are really frightened and for him to treat it almost like a joke, was absolutely horrific and demeans the office of prime minister. I believe the prime minister is inciting hatred towards MPs. I understand the importance of saying that, but I know that feeling is shared by many of us. She said one MP had contacted her since last night saying the rhetoric used meant she would not stand at the next election. But Sherriff said she herself was determined to continue as an MP. She said: \u201cI will not let these bullies win and I include the prime minister in that.\u201d She said she feared that another MP could be killed and insisted she was \u201cnot scaremongering\u201d. She also called on MPs from all sides of the house to tone down their rhetoric: \u201cWe all need to reflect on our language and our behaviour. The bad behaviour is not exclusive to Conservative MPs.\u201d But she singled out the Treasury minister Simon Clarke for accusing her of making a \u201ctoxic\u201d intervention in her angry question to the prime minister. Sherriff described Clarke\u2019s tweet as abhorrent. \u201cIt makes me sick,\u201d she said. She said she had had threats of rape, murder and mutilation earlier this year. The abuse comes every day, thankfully the death threats don\u2019t. Last night the overwhelming majority of the communications I received were supportive, including from many Conservative supporters. But equally I received some horrific abuse last night much of it misogynistic. We urgently need to dial down the rhetoric. Labour MPs remain furious about Johnson\u2019s comments about Jo Cox, but many are now citing her memory to try to mend divisions. Duddridge refuses to be drawn on what circumstances the government would seek an extension to the 31 October Brexit deadline. He again repeats that the government will obey the law. Hilary Benn says the government\u2019s claims about obeying the law and not seeking an extension are not compatible. How can those things be reconciled, Benn asks. Duddridge says the PM really doesn\u2019t want an extension. The government is breaking every sinew to get a deal. The government will obey the law, he says again. The Brexit minister James Duddridge insists the government \u201cwill obey the law\u201d. But asked how the prime minister can avoid asking for an extension under the Benn Act \u2013 or European Union (Withdrawal) (No 2) Act 2019 \u2013 he says: \u201cThat is a hypothetical question I don\u2019t want to be drawn into ...\u201d Duddridge says the government will use \u201cevery bit of wriggle room\u201d to get a deal. Four urgent questions have been granted today covering: the Benn Act, Hong Kong, arms exports to Saudi Arabia and the prime minister\u2019s language and role. The Speaker, John Bercow, has appealed to MPs to stop using toxic language. Opening today\u2019s session in the Commons, Bercow says: There is a widespread sense across the house, and beyond, that yesterday the house did itself no credit. There was an atmosphere in the chamber worse than any I\u2019ve known in my 22 years in the house. On both sides passions were inflamed, angry words were uttered. The culture was toxic. He says he has been approached by two senior MPs from either side of the house for a formal consideration of political conduct. Pending consideration of that, he has granted a urgent question about the language used across the house. Bercow says it is not a partisan issue. It is about something bigger than party affiliation, he says. Bercow says: \u201cPlease lower the decibel level and treat each other as opponents rather than enemies.\u201d UPDATE: Here is the Labour MP Harriet Harman welcoming Bercow\u2019s comments. Harman and Ken Clarke have been calling for a Speaker\u2019s conference on threats to MP. They are the mother and father of the house respectively (ie, the longest-serving female and male MPs). The former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith has claimed it is parliament\u2019s refusal to deliver Brexit that is fuelling anger in the country. Speaking to Sky News, he said opposition MPs were equally to blame for intemperate language in the Commons. I think this is the pot calling the kettle black. Last night I watched when Labour MPs lined up, they were shouting that he was a liar, he was a cheat. It wasn\u2019t about Boris Johnson, it was about the issue. The issue which they want to dance away from which is causing this is that when you promise the British people you will act on the result of the vote that they were given in 2016 and parliament goes on saying no, this is the fuel that feeds the anger and therefore it has to be resolved. Si\u00e2n Berry, the co-leader of the Green party, and a member of the London assembly\u2019s oversight committee condemned Cleverly\u2019s suggestion that Johnson would ignore any summons over the Arcuri questions. Speaking to the Guardian she said: \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone can really predict which laws the prime minister is going to obey. He has left himself basically in contempt of parliament. But we would expect him to comply with the law. \u201cSeeing the prime minister last night suggesting that he won\u2019t behave in a way that is appropriate is really disturbing. The prime minister\u2019s one job is to effectively uphold the law and the fact that we have got one who is not doing that on a regular basis is very very disturbing. And that people are prepared to justify that is even more disturbing.\u201d Berry challenged Cleverly\u2019s assertion that ministers could ignore the assembly. She pointed out that it did have the legal power to compel the prime minister to appear. We very rarely use our powers of summons. On the Garden Bridge we informally invited Boris Johnson, first in a letter, and then we sent a proper summons because we needed to hear from him. We had to get advice on whether we could do that to a former mayor, but we could, so we did. And we would again. Earlier this week the London assembly wrote to Johnson giving him 14 days to respond to the allegations about Jennifer Arcuri. The letter from Len Duvall chair of the assembly\u2019s oversight committee, said: I read with concern the allegations set out in the Sunday Times yesterday that, when you held the office of mayor of London, you failed to declare a potential conflict of interest in relation to the awarding of public funds to Jennifer Arcuri. As you will know, the London assembly is responsible for holding to account the office of the mayor of London. Accordingly, I now write to ask that you provide, within 14 days of receipt of this letter: \u2013 Details and a timeline of all contact with Jennifer Arcuri during your period of office as mayor of London, including personal, social and professional. \u2013 And an explanation of how that alleged personal relationship was disclosed and taken into account in any and all dealings with the GLA and other parts of the GLA family. James Cleverly suggested Johnson would ignore any request by the London assembly to appear before it to answer questions about his conduct as mayor of London over the tech businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri. The assembly has given him 14 days to explain why sponsorship and favours were granted to Arcuri, a close friend of Johnson, without any declaration of interest being made. Members of the assembly have suggested they could also summons Johnson to answer questions about Arcuri, as they did over the failed Garden Bridge project. Asked whether Johnson would appear before the London assembly, the Tory chairman told Today: \u201cThe London assembly\u2019s job is to scrutinise the mayor of London. When I was on the London assembly it was quite common for government ministers to refuse to appear.\u201d When it was put to him that the assembly had the legal power to summons members of the government, Cleverly said: \u201cThat is not my understanding.\u201d The Tory party chairman, James Cleverly, has defended the prime minister\u2019s language in the Commons. Speaking on Today he said he couldn\u2019t see how the \u201chighly charged\u201d atmosphere in the house would calm down until Brexit was resolved. Cleverly tried to claim the prime minister had not used the language of \u201cbetrayal\u201d before being corrected. He also claimed language on all sides had been intemperate and violent. When Johnson accused the Labour MP Paula Sherriff of talking \u201chumbug\u201d, Cleverly claimed Johnson was responding to accusations that were untrue. The rhetoric could be de-escalated if both sides calmed down and compromised, Cleverly said. Asked whether Johnson would seek an extension to avoid a no-deal Brexit as set out in the Benn Act, Cleverly insisted that Johnson would obey the law. We will obey the law, Cleverly said, but he refused to say whether the PM would abide by the Benn Act. We will leave by 31 October, Cleverly said. Luciana Berger, who joined the Liberal Democrats after leaving Labour, will give up her Liverpool constituency to fight for a London seat once held by Margaret Thatcher, PA reports. The campaigner against antisemitism will contest the seat of Finchley and Golders Green in north London, a constituency with a sizeable Jewish community, at the next election. The Lib Dems came third in 2017, 21,000 off the Conservative victor, Mike Freer, in a seat formerly held by ex-prime minister Mrs Thatcher for more than 30 years, albeit under a slightly different make-up. Berger quit the Labour party in February, walking out with six other colleagues, and went on to form Change UK. The constituency voted 70% to remain and Berger will be hoping her party\u2019s recently approved policy of revoking article 50 if it wins a majority at the next election will make her a serious contender. Her Jewish background could also play a factor in attracting voters who rejected Labour over concerns of growing antisemitism in the party. Golders Green is home to one of the largest Jewish communities in the capital, with kosher bakeries and a visible Hasidic presence on its high streets and in the adjacent Temple Fortune. Nicholas Soames, one of the 21 rebels to have lost the Tory whip, said he was \u201cappalled\u201d by the language of the prime minister and said it made the prospect of getting a Brexit deal through the Commons more difficult. But the grandson of Winston Churchill stopped short of calling on Johnson to resign. He said: It sounds rather pathetic, the one won\u2019t stand and call for his resignation after his behaviour. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s helpful. It is just going to further destabilise an already a very febrile and very fragile situation. Soames accused the prime minister of launching a \u201crant\u201d against the Labour party and Jeremy Corbyn. He said: I have never felt such a poisonous atmosphere. I deeply regret it and I apologise for it ... I was absolutely appalled by the whole language and tone of the House yesterday starting off for the attorney general\u2019s, in my view, disrespect to the supreme court, and not a word of contrition, or humility from the prime minister. He urged Johnson to calm tempers and try to build a compromise. I have grown up in a House where I believe the job of the prime minister, even under very difficult circumstances, is to try to bring the country together. And what the prime minister did yesterday, was to drive it further apart. I want Boris Johnson to start behaving like a prime minister and what he did yesterday makes what he has to do so much harder, which is to reach out across the House of Commons to build a compromise to get a deal. He needs to calm the thing down. I\u2019m afraid the country is being set up for a general election, which will be \u2018parliament and the judges against the people\u2019. Brendan Cox, the husband of the murdered MP Jo, has condemned the \u201csloppy language\u201d of Boris Johnson and the \u201cgrowing inferno of rhetoric\u201d in the House of Commons. The prime minister was widely condemned last night when he said the best way to honour the memory of Jo Cox was to get Brexit done. In a notably restrained reaction on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Cox, said he was \u201cshocked\u201d by the language Johnson used, but noted that the prime minister\u2019s remarks were said \u201cin the on heat the moment\u201d. Cox said: I\u2019m sure on reflection, it\u2019s something that he would probably wish he hadn\u2019t said. I think it was sloppy language and the wrong thing to say, but I but I don\u2019t think that he is an evil man. What isn\u2019t legitimate is to co-opt her memory or her beliefs for things that she didn\u2019t believe in or didn\u2019t say. I was thinking about how Jo would respond to it last night. She would have tried to take a generosity of spirit to it. And thought about how in this moment, you can step back from this growing inferno of rhetoric. Cox urged politicians of both sides of the Brexit debate to tone down the rhetoric used and stop portraying each other as good or evil. \u201cWe just have to have a more nuanced understanding to remember our common our common humanity,\u201d Cox said. He added: \u201cI was genuinely shocked by the the willingness to descend to vitriol, because I think it does long lasting harm. To have this debate descend into this bear pit of polarisation, I think it\u2019s dangerous for our country.\u201d There is a willingness to jump out and decry the other side when they use language like \u2018surrender\u2019 or \u2018traitor\u2019 or \u2018betrayal\u2019. And I think that is inflammatory language. But as inflammatory are those people who have used the language of it being a \u2018coup\u2019 and \u2018dictatorship\u2019 and \u2018fascism\u2019. I think both of those approaches are unacceptable. It is not just bad behaviour by one side of the debate. This is something which is infected our politics, and it\u2019s this vicious cycle where language gets more extreme, response gets more extreme, it all gets hyped up ... It creates an atmosphere where I think violence and attacks are more likely. You can disagree passionately with people. But you don\u2019t have to impugn their motives, whether you are a hard Brexiteer or a hard remainer, actually, what you have in common is a desire to do what you think is best for the country. What isn\u2019t acceptable is to demonize each other to build a culture of hatred to the other to create this tribal identity. Whatever happens with Brexit, the country is going to have to come together again. And we have to remember that, otherwise, we\u2019ll be building a toxic legacy. How the papers covered it The furious and dramatic scenes in Westminster dominate the front pages on Thursday as papers report on Boris Johnson\u2019s return to the House of Commons after his decision to suspend parliament was found to be unlawful. A few moments from last night\u2019s political television... And of course, Robert Peston\u2019s interview with Boris Johnson. A lot of senior political journalists tweeting their shock at the tone of debate in parliament yesterday. This is from Julian King, the European commissioner for security. Luciana Berger has issued a letter to her constituents on Twitter telling them she would be stepping down as MP for Liverpool Wavertree, where she has served for almost 10 years, due to the challenges of \u201cbalancing personal and professional responsibilities\u201d, particularly with young children. She will be relocating to London after the next election and be standing as the Liberal Democrat Prospective Parliamentary Candidate for Finchley and Golders Green. The Conservatives have also tabled a motion to be voted on this morning, to support shutting down parliament for three days next week to accommodate their party conference, despite the supreme court verdict. Outrage as Boris Johnson dismisses dangers of inflammatory language as \u2018humbug\u2019 Here is the moment that has so many people so furious. Yesterday Labour MP Paula Sherriff attacked the prime minister for repeatedly calling the act put through parliament by Hilary Benn to take no-deal Brexit off the table the \u201csurrender bill\u201d and asked him not to use \u201coffensive, dangerous, inflammatory language for legislation we do not like.\u201d Recalling the memory of her friend Cox, she said many MPs had received death threats. \u201cAnd let me tell the prime minister \u2013 they often quote his words, \u2018surrender act\u2019, \u2018betrayal,\u2019 \u2018traitor\u2019: we must moderate our language and it has to come from the prime minister first.\u201d Johnson replied that he had never heard such \u201chumbug\u201d in all his life. He caused further outrage when telling Labour\u2019s Tracy Brabin, who was elected to Cox\u2019s seat following the MP\u2019s murder by a far-right extremist a week before the EU referendum, that \u201cthe best way to honour the memory of Jo Cox and to bring this country together is, I think, to get Brexit done\u201d. MPs (and it should be noted, mostly female MPs) responded by sharing death threats they have received, some of which directly quote Johnson. Some did so in the chamber yesterday, others on Twitter overnight. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the day\u2019s political news. We return to the political fray after a day in which an unrepentant Boris Johnson sparked a furious backlash for repeating criticism of the supreme court judgment, and rejecting MPs\u2019 pleas to moderate his \u201cinflammatory\u201d language. As you\u2019ll no doubt recall, Johnson faced parliament yesterday after flying back early from New York when the Supreme Court ruled his suspension unlawful. But Johnson was unrepentant as he addressed MPs and went on the attack, accusing Jeremy Corbyn of trying to thwart Brexit and running scared of an election. He also caused outrage by claiming the best way to honour the memory of the murdered MP Jo Cox was to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d. There was much criticism of Johnson\u2019s language, yesterday, with MPs, particularly female MPs, imploring Johnson to be stop using words like \u201csurrender\u201d, \u201ctraitor\u201d and \u201cbetrayal\u201d in relation to Brexit, with the MPs saying these words had been used in death threats issued to them and their families. Johnson caused outrage by dismissing these concerns as \u201chumbug\u201d. Yesterday and overnight, MPs were tweeting out some of the threats, including death threats, they have received, which directly quoted Boris Johnson. So, what happens now? Parliament will sit again today where there will be a \u201cgeneral debate on the principles of democracy and the rights of the electorate\u201d. And Jacob Rees-Mogg said he would be making an \u201cexciting announcement\u201d in the Commons. So, we\u2019ll all be on the edge of our seats for that \u2013 or lazily reclined across three seats, as the case may be.

But he stressed he would do everything possible to fix what he called the collateral damage. \u201cNothing is completely broken,\u201d Pochettino said, with regard to relationships within the squad. \u201cIt\u2019s just that sometimes, temporarily, the mindset can change and then to get back on track takes time or solutions. It\u2019s only been three weeks [since the European window closed]. Your circumstances and your mental preparation as an athlete don\u2019t just change overnight.\u201d</p> \n<p>It was put to Pochettino that with the stadium move having been completed and three new faces added to the squad, the club might appear better off when compared to last season, when they were renting Wembley until April and made no signings.</p> \n<p>\u201cWho says that?\u201d Pochettino replied, his opposition to the idea plain. \u201cChallenges appear, personal circumstances appear. It doesn\u2019t mean more names make a better team. It doesn\u2019t follow that, if you have a \u00a31.2bn stadium, you will win more games. Football is not an ordinary business. Ninety-nine per cent of the time two plus two is not four. That is why football is so complex and why a lot of managers are sacked.\u201d</p> \n<p>Pochettino made the point that nobody is the same after they play a Champions League final. \u201cThe perception and expectation is different,\u201d he said. \u201cIt creates a new circumstance for the club which is different again and we need to find a solution.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b5c42063-e9a0-49a2-92c5-24ba2021a269\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Twitter:</b> follow us at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardian_sport\">@guardian_sport</a></p>\n    <p><b>Facebook:</b> like our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardianfootball\">football</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiansport\">sport</a> pages</p>\n    <p><b>Instagram:</b> our favourite <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardian_sport/\">photos, films and stories</a></p>\n    <p><b>YouTube:</b> subscribe to our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/GuardianFootball\">football</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwD9E_QNwFwrQC7OnPnrg2Q\">sport</a> channels</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The most pressing matter on the field is the team\u2019s lack of pressing. \u201cCollectively, we need to press better,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cI was talking with some players \u2013 it\u2019s like when you go with friends to play five-a-side.

After Colchester, the team\u2019s record shows only two wins from eight games. Yet Pochettino has been through worse. He even said that the early months of his first season at Spurs were tougher than what he is currently enduring. It was Pochettino\u2019s day to put on a show of defiance, to summon perspective and get his messages across away from the prickly heat of a post-match press conference. He spoke for almost 50 minutes, sometimes switching into Spanish to ensure clarity, and it added up to a rallying cry which he hopes can spark an upturn, beginning at home to Southampton. As previously the discussion was framed by the internal politics of the summer, taking in recruitment and the desire of a clutch of players to leave. It had been the same story in the summer of 2018. This time there was intense speculation over Christian Eriksen, Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen \u2013 each of whom has now entered the final year on his contract \u2013 plus Danny Rose, Serge Aurier and Victor Wanyama. In the end all six stayed. Pochettino argued the distractions had gravely undermined the club until the closure of the European transfer window on 2 September and it was wrong to expect the players would be able to refocus in the blink of an eye; that the togetherness of the squad would instantly return to normal. But he stressed he would do everything possible to fix what he called the collateral damage. \u201cNothing is completely broken,\u201d Pochettino said, with regard to relationships within the squad. \u201cIt\u2019s just that sometimes, temporarily, the mindset can change and then to get back on track takes time or solutions. It\u2019s only been three weeks [since the European window closed]. Your circumstances and your mental preparation as an athlete don\u2019t just change overnight.\u201d It was put to Pochettino that with the stadium move having been completed and three new faces added to the squad, the club might appear better off when compared to last season, when they were renting Wembley until April and made no signings. \u201cWho says that?\u201d Pochettino replied, his opposition to the idea plain. \u201cChallenges appear, personal circumstances appear. It doesn\u2019t mean more names make a better team. It doesn\u2019t follow that, if you have a \u00a31.2bn stadium, you will win more games. Football is not an ordinary business. Ninety-nine per cent of the time two plus two is not four. That is why football is so complex and why a lot of managers are sacked.\u201d Pochettino made the point that nobody is the same after they play a Champions League final. \u201cThe perception and expectation is different,\u201d he said. \u201cIt creates a new circumstance for the club which is different again and we need to find a solution.\u201d The most pressing matter on the field is the team\u2019s lack of pressing. \u201cCollectively, we need to press better,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cI was talking with some players \u2013 it\u2019s like when you go with friends to play five-a-side. No one wants to go in goal. You want to play with the ball. You don\u2019t want to be chasing people and running in behind. Maybe we lose this balance. \u201cThere is another part to the game \u2013 having the will to recover the ball, this aggressivity, and we drop a little bit in this collectively. This is the key point we need to fix.\u201d Pochettino argued the team\u2019s performances were \u201cnot as bad as the feeling and atmosphere that we create\u201d and, ever self-assured, he remains convinced that Spurs can take the most difficult final step to silverware with him. \u201cI believe and hope this, yes,\u201d he said. \u201cIf not, you are going to see quickly.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has insisted that the state department behaved appropriately in its dealings with the Ukrainian government and Donald Trump\u2019s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. Democrats called Pompeo\u2019s response inadequate and called on him to appear before Congress, arguing that department officials would have been privy to a July call between Trump and Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Two US diplomats are mentioned in the whistleblower report on Trump\u2019s relations with Kyiv released on Thursday: the part-time special envoy Kurt Volker and the ambassador to the EU, Gordon Sondland. According to the report they traveled to Ukraine the day after the critical Trump-Zelenskiy call to meet the Ukrainian president. The whistleblower report said that the two diplomats had \u201cprovided advice to the Ukrainian leadership about how to \u2018navigate\u2019 the demands that the president had made of Mr Zelenskiy\u201d. The report also said they also gave advice on how to \u201cunderstand and respond to the differing messages they were receiving from official US channels on the one hand, and from Mr Giuliani on the other\u201d. State department officials have confirmed that Volker helped Zelenskiy\u2019s office get in touch with Giuliani. Questioned about the involvement of state department officials in connecting the Kyiv government with Giuliani, Pompeo sought to play down the importance of the whistleblower report. \u201cI haven\u2019t had a chance to actually read the whistleblower complaint yet. I read the first couple of paragraphs, but I got busy today,\u201d Pompeo told reporters in New York where he is attending the UN general asssembly. \u201cBut I\u2019ll ultimately get a chance to see it.

Menendez said in a tweet that the whistleblower report \u201cshows senior state department officials were both on the line AND briefed after Trump\u2019s call pressuring Ukraine\u2019s government. \u201c[Secretary Pompeo] must appear before the Senate foreign relations committee immediately to explain his agency\u2019s role in this mess.\u201d Pompeo cut short questions at his press conference and was not asked about his own role in adding credence to Trump\u2019s allegations about the Biden family and cutting short the posting of the former US ambassador to Kyiv Marie Yovanovitch in May after she was attacked by rightwing media for being anti-Trump. In his July call to Zelenskiy, Trump referred to her disparagingly as \u201cthe woman\u201d, calling her \u201cbad news\u201d, and adding, darkly and mysteriously: \"she\u2019s going to go through some things\u201d. \u201cYovanovitch was slimed,\u201d said Daniel Fried, former secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs. \u201cThe way she was treated was disgraceful. I have known her for 25 years and she is careful, scrupulous, and professional. She is someone who does not freelance. She is a straight arrow.\u201d Fried, now at the Atlantic Council, said that aides to the former president Petro Poroshenko had denounced Yovanovitch to their allies in the conservative US press, because she had been highly critical of the failure to prosecute corruption aggressively. A former official familiar with the sequence of events said Zelenskiy\u2019s office began trying to organise a summit meeting with Trump soon after his election in April. With the help of the US embassy, a tentative plan was put together for the two leaders to meet at a conference on Ukrainian reform in July. The White House pulled out of that event and suggested a White House meeting in late July. That date was then postponed. Meanwhile Giuliani approached the US embassy in Kyiv asking for ways of connecting to Zelenskiy\u2019s inner circle but he was rebuffed by Yovanovitch. \u201cGiuliani reached out in the spring, but they stiffed him,\u201d the former official said, adding that Trump\u2019s lawyer was trying to persuade the new Zelenskiy government to look into the activities of Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden had a seat on the board. When Zelenskiy\u2019s entourage was not responsive, military aid to Ukraine was suspended in July, just before Trump\u2019s second call to the Ukrainian president. \u201cThe weapons were added as an effort to persuade them further,\u201d a former official said. Another former official with knowledge of current Washington-Kyiv relations said: \u201cMasha [Yovanovitch] was suspect because she was very critical of the lack of anti-corruption prosecutions. And I think she stiff-armed Giuliani, and wouldn\u2019t help him. Being a professional, she didn\u2019t want to play political games.\u201d The American Foreign Service Association issued a statement on Thursday demanding that the service of US diplomats \u201cnot be politicised, and that they not be dragged into partisan political battles\u201d. Fried said that he had sympathy for Volker and Sondland, who had been put in a difficult situation, under pressure from Trump to connect Zelenskiy with Giuliani to dig up compromising material on Biden and his son Hunter. \u201cThe state department people mentioned come off well. They tried to contain the damage. In their place I might have done the same,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were trying to help Ukraine maintain good relations with the US while doing what they could to satisfy Trump, without crossing any lines.\u201d Another former colleague of Volker\u2019s was less charitable. \u201cI think Kurt is trying to have his cake and eat it,\u201d the former official said. Volker\u2019s role as envoy is unpaid and part-time. He has kept his job as director of the McCain Institute for International leadership at Arizona University, and, according to MSNBC news on Thursday, had at the same time worked for a lobbying firm with international clients. \u201cHe is getting drawn into corrupt efforts that are incompatible with his diplomatic role. He should consider resigning.\u201d The state department and the McCain Institute had not responded to requests for comment at the time of publication.",

The safety and security of every single fan is of the utmost importance to us. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of training, there\u2019s a lot of understanding there are different cultures that are going to be descending here and we need to maintain that we are a hospitable culture and hospitable people.\u201d However, he said fans coming for the tournament would also have to be respectful of local laws and customs. \u201cWe are also going to expect people to get acquainted with our norms and our culture and our laws,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd whatever happens in the middle is where we need to make sure it is dealt with in the most appropriate way to make sure it\u2019s a World Cup where everybody feels welcome \u2013 and that nobody feels they are in any way intimidated or threatened, whether it\u2019s over religion or gender, across the board, for everybody.\u201d When pressed about how Qataris may react to a gay couple holding hands, Al-Khater insisted they would not be treated any differently from any other couple or individual. \u201cI will put it another way: a public display of affection is frowned upon,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s not part of our culture. But that goes across the board to everybody.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Friday 27 September. Top stories The whistleblower who sparked the impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump was a CIA officer assigned to the White House, US media have reported, on a day in which the Trump administration was accused of attempting to \u201ccover up\u201d the president\u2019s Ukraine conversation. Democrats have continued to question the behaviour of the state department and Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudy Guiliani in their dealings with the Ukrainian government. The governor of Vermont, Phil Scott, has become the first Republican to come out in support of the impeachment inquiry. Age pensioners could be the target of more than 1 million new robodebt calls as the government seeks to expand its heavily criticised data-matching program over the next three years. Having primarily focused on targeting Newstart and Youth Allowance recipients, departmental projections put to the Senate suggest the scheme will be expanded to include pensioners, to help meet fiscal savings targets of $2.1bn. The peak welfare body has called for the program to be abolished: \u201cPeople have reported their life being ruined as a result of robodebt,\u201d Acoss said. The Queensland government is poised to sign a significant royalties agreement with the mining company Adani but risks shortchanging taxpayers from the state unless it first secures access to the company\u2019s rail line, the Australia Institute has warned. A sophisticated quid pro quo devised by the state\u2019s Labor government could see Adani receive between $250m and $700m in royalties before the infrastructural criteria of the deal \u2013 an airport, a rail line and a second port terminal \u2013 have been met. The former army general Jim Molan could face a challenge for Senate preselection as jostling factions within the Liberal party consider rival nominations. Richard Shields and Kent Johns are understood to have gathered significant support from moderates within the party, with many conservatives also believed to have been angered by what was dubbed a \u201crogue campaign\u201d by Molan before the previous federal election. World Boris Johnson has suffered a seventh consecutive vote defeat as a motion for a mini recess was lost on another tumultuous day in British politics. Meanwhile, experts have warned that the heated rhetoric engaged by politicians debating Brexit risks triggering violence on the streets. The self-proclaimed heir to Charles de Gaulle, the former French president Jacques Chirac, has died aged 86. Acclaimed for his opposition to the Iraq war but condemned for political inaction in office and corruption allegations, Chirac remained fondly remembered for his charm. The Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad has used a chemical weapon, the US has alleged, in contravention of terms agreed after airstrikes on Syria in 2018. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, told the media Assad\u2019s \u201cinnumerable atrocities\u201d accounted to \u201ccrimes against humanity\u201d. The whistleblower who exposed the spread of HIV and hepatitis C through blood contamination in China has died while hiking in the US. Dr Shuping Wang is believed to have saved tens of thousands of lives by urging widespread screening. Opinion and analysis As Abbey Road turns 50, Alexis Petridis asks: what was the Beatles\u2019 all-time greatest single? From the \u201ccharmless\u201d Ballad of John and Yoko to the simplicity and naivety of Love Me Do, the earthy and troubled Lady Madonna to the \u201csatire of swinging London\u2019s thrusting ambition\u201d in Paperback Writer. There can be only one number one \u2013 where does your favourite rank? Having a sports-mad dad is tough when you\u2019re in the 13-Is. A team that was objectively and statistically appalling didn\u2019t appear to dampen his enthusiasm, writes Ben Jenkins. \u201cI thought Dad was just in denial about having a dud kid and I sort of felt sorry for him having to turn up, week after week and have his son let him down.\u201d But having watched his own eight-month-old boy achieve rudimentary feats the penny has dropped: when it comes to family it\u2019s all relative. Sport Dismissed as a \u201cplastic\u201d football club and even a \u201choax\u201d when launched, the Greater Western Sydney Giants have finally rewarded AFL\u2019s long-game thinking. And an inaugural flag this weekend against Richmond would be the capstone on head office\u2019s expansion strategy, writes Scott Heinrich. Australian rugby league has always had an on-off love affair with English players. But South Sydney and Canberra have taken the relationship to brave new heights, as what was once a trickle of UK talent has become a flood, writes John Davidson. Thinking time: life as a cancer patient For Anne Boyer, being confronted with cancer presented an unenviable choice. Succumb to the illness or submit to a cure so poisonous it could mean a loss of memory, speech or even sight. Facing a rare form of breast cancer with few treatment options and a significantly poorer prognosis than usual, Boyer opted for \u201cneoadjuvant chemotherapy\u201d. \u201cChemotherapy, like most medical treatments, is boring. Like death, it is a lot of waiting for your name to be called. It is also waiting while the potential for panic and pain hangs around, too, waiting for its name to be called. In this it is like war.\u201d And as for many survivors of war, even after the event the scars run deep. Here is an excerpt from Anne\u2019s \u201cbeautiful book against beauty\u201d. Media roundup More than 60,000 people are awaiting a review of their migration appeal, reports the Australian, as a record number of visa refusals has overwhelmed the administrative appeal tribunal. Women over 40 are more at risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s than men, research into the disease suggests, according to the Herald Sun. And a long-neglected legal loophole for drug drivers is about to be closed by the WA government, writes nine.com.au, including reforms that target those who are both drunk and on drugs.

      "body": "<p>The shadows of Old Trafford are almost visible from Salford\u2019s AJ Bell Stadium but never has it seemed as close as it does now. It is almost a year to the day since the Red Devils secured survival on the final day of the season: now they are just one win away from a first appearance in the Grand Final. This side, who were simply far too good for Castleford here, have Super League\u2019s second-lowest budget.</p> <p>There are players whom other teams simply did not want. But together, they are greater than the sum of their parts and they will head to either St Helens or Wigan next Friday as a dangerous side to say the least.

The meeting of opposition parties on Thursday took place the day after parliament was hastily reconvened following a decision by the supreme court that the advice the prime minister gave to the Queen on the prorogation of parliament was unlawful. Speaking following the meeting, Corbyn expressed concern that Johnson had not given an explicit undertaking that he would abide by the so-called Benn Act, which is designed to force the prime minister to ask for an extension of article 50 if parliament does not pass a deal with the EU by 19 October. He said the law was \u201cnot a matter of choice\u201d for Johnson. \u201cIt\u2019s an act of parliament that was passed,\u201d said Corbyn. \u201cWe will be taking parliamentary action on this again next week to ensure that the prime minister does not crash us out of the EU on 31 October without a deal.\u201d Liz Saville Roberts, the Plaid Cymru leader in the Commons, said Boris Johnson could not be allowed to \u201csimply brush off breaking the law\u201d. \u201cPlaid Cymru will work with other opposition parties to hold him to account and are actively considering means in parliament that would see the prime minister censured,\u201d she said. The Green party MP Caroline Lucas tweeted an image of herself with other opposition politicians. \u201cAway from the bombast and bullying of the prime minister, the real work goes on. MPs from across the house continue to meet to stop his disastrous crash-out Brexit,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThis is what our politics should look like.\u201d A Plaid Cymru source said opposition MPs were getting on better than expected. \u201cIt surprises all of us how easy these meetings are,\u201d they said.",

      "bodyText": "Thousands of patients will have to wait to receive their winter flu jab after one of the NHS\u2019s main suppliers warned GP surgeries that the vaccine would be delayed by two weeks. The hold-up involves the flu jab which people aged 16 to 65 and also pregnant women were due to start receiving next month to protect them during the winter months. It means that patients enrolled at some surgeries \u2013 including those whose health makes them more vulnerable to flu \u2013 will not be able to have their jab as soon as they wanted. Sanofi Pasteur, which supplies about a third of the 3m jabs administered by GP practices every year in England, has written to surgeries to alert them to the delay. The hitch will cause problems for hospitals, which also immunise people against flu, although on a much smaller scale than GPs. It is understood that manufacturing and packaging problems, rather than Brexit, lie behind the hold-up. In its letter the firm says 60% of surgeries that were due to receive the first of three planned deliveries of the vaccine in the week beginning 7 October will still do so. However, 25% will not get their deliveries until a week later and 15% will have to wait two weeks, until the week beginning 21 October. But, the letter adds, deliveries of the second batch of supplies due to start arriving at hospitals and GP practices in the weeks beginning 14 and 21 October respectively will also be delayed, again by one or two weeks. \u201cImpact on second deliveries: 100% of second deliveries delayed\u201d, it says. Delivery of the third and final supplies, due at hospitals from 4 November and GP practices from 18 November, \u201cremains unchanged at this current time\u201d, the letter adds. This is the second delay to supplies of Sanofi\u2019s quadrivalent influenza vaccine that it planned to deliver to the NHS this autumn. The first hold-up occurred in July as a result of the World Health Organization taking longer than expected to decide which strains of flu this winter\u2019s jab should cover. Under-16s and those over 65 receive a slightly different version of the vaccine to the one affected by this delay. The jabs are important because flu is thought to kill about 8,000 people a year in England, of whom 6,000 have a serious problem with their heart or lungs. There are fears that the UK could be hit this winter by the same particularly virulent strain of flu that circulated in Australia over the summer \u2013 their winter \u2013 which claimed lives. Individual GP surgeries in England have a contract with the drug firms that make the flu vaccine and purchase it directly, and are then repaid by the NHS for immunising patients.",

Tower Hamlets covers the old East End of London, and includes much of the redeveloped Docklands area, including Canary Wharf. In Hackney and Islington, \u00a31m properties sit among high concentrations of social housing.</p> <p>As a counterpoint to the changes in London, the indices show the most dense concentrations of deprived neighbourhoods in England are still to be found in the post-industrial areas of the north and north east, such as Middlesbrough, Liverpool and Blackpool.</p> <p>In Middlesbrough, nearly half of neighbourhoods are in the top 10% most deprived in the country. Nearly a quarter of the 94 neighbourhoods in Blackpool are in the most deprived 1% in England.</p> <p>A cluster of local authorities in the north-west of England \u2013 Oldham, Rossendale and Burnley \u2013 are among a handful where there have been increases in the proportion of neighbourhoods that are in the top 10% deprived in the country.</p> <p>The isolated Essex coastal village of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/sep/30/jaywick-tops-list-most-deprived-english-neighbourhoods\">Jaywick</a> \u2013 which has become a vivid symbol of poverty and social breakdown in recent years \u2013 has been identified as the most deprived neighbourhood in England for the third successive time.</p> <p>Giles Watling, whose Clacton constituency covers the area, said he was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d by the report, saying there had been significant investment in Jaywick recently. \u201cIt is an area of truly outstanding natural beauty and the people there have a lot to offer \u2013 not least because of their strong sense of community. I truly want to see the area thrive.\u201d</p> <p>In its 1930s heyday, Jaywick was a holiday village built for East End car workers but its geographical remoteness hastened its decline in recent decades and it has become subject of a TV documentary and even a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/02/trump-is-a-cheeky-sod-essex-villagers-react-to-us-campaign-ad\">Republican party attack advert</a> in the US.

      "bodyText": "A surge in the number of wealthy incomers moving into new-build apartments in regenerated neighbourhoods appears to be radically transforming the socio-economic profile of some of London\u2019s traditionally most-deprived areas. The high concentrations of deprivation found historically in the boroughs of Tower Hamlets, Westminster and Islington appear to be becoming significantly diluted, according to the latest official indices of deprivation in England. In what may be seen partly as a gentrification effect, the latest data show just 1.4% of neighbourhoods in Tower Hamlets were in the 10% most deprived in England compared with 55% in 2004. In Hackney, where nearly half of neighbourhoods were in the top 10% most deprived in 2004, just one in 10 now were. In Islington, where a third of neighbourhoods were classified as among the most deprived 15 years ago, 5% now were. However, experts warned against seeing the data as evidence that that poverty and inequality had reduced in these areas, or that poorer people had been displaced in significant numbers. Alasdair Rae, professor of urban studies and planning at the University of Sheffield, said the population of Tower Hamlets had increased by 100,000 since 2004. \u201cThere is no way that every person contributing to Tower Hamlets being one of the most deprived boroughs in the past has disappeared.\u201d A study by the Trust For London last year found that Tower Hamlets had the highest levels of child poverty in the capital at 43%, the highest rate of worklessness, and struggled with high levels of inequality. The deprivation indices are used to target a range of funding streams, including EU regional development grants and dedicated schools grants, so any change in the deprivation profile of an area could have a financial impact on public services. One inner London council leader said the deprivation data did not appear to reflect the reality of poverty in local communities or the pressure on local authorities who had to deal with its effects. \u201cWe haven\u2019t noticed a drop-off in deprivation in the borough and the complexity of difficult cases gets worse.\u201d All three boroughs have been affected by the development boom around the City of London in recent years. Tower Hamlets covers the old East End of London, and includes much of the redeveloped Docklands area, including Canary Wharf. In Hackney and Islington, \u00a31m properties sit among high concentrations of social housing. As a counterpoint to the changes in London, the indices show the most dense concentrations of deprived neighbourhoods in England are still to be found in the post-industrial areas of the north and north east, such as Middlesbrough, Liverpool and Blackpool. In Middlesbrough, nearly half of neighbourhoods are in the top 10% most deprived in the country. Nearly a quarter of the 94 neighbourhoods in Blackpool are in the most deprived 1% in England. A cluster of local authorities in the north-west of England \u2013 Oldham, Rossendale and Burnley \u2013 are among a handful where there have been increases in the proportion of neighbourhoods that are in the top 10% deprived in the country. The isolated Essex coastal village of Jaywick \u2013 which has become a vivid symbol of poverty and social breakdown in recent years \u2013 has been identified as the most deprived neighbourhood in England for the third successive time. Giles Watling, whose Clacton constituency covers the area, said he was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d by the report, saying there had been significant investment in Jaywick recently. \u201cIt is an area of truly outstanding natural beauty and the people there have a lot to offer \u2013 not least because of their strong sense of community. I truly want to see the area thrive.\u201d In its 1930s heyday, Jaywick was a holiday village built for East End car workers but its geographical remoteness hastened its decline in recent decades and it has become subject of a TV documentary and even a Republican party attack advert in the US. It was notably visited by the UN poverty rapporteur Phillip Alston a year ago. The least deprived neighbourhood in England is an area close to the village of Prestwood, near Great Missenden in Buckinghamshire, and a few kilometres to the south of the prime minister\u2019s country residence at Chequers. The indices of deprivation measure seven domains of deprivation \u2013 including income, employment, health, disability, and education and skills, in each of 32,844 English neighbourhoods, called lower-layer super output areas, which are then ranked relative to other areas. Unlike measures of poverty \u2013 which focus largely on lack of financial resources \u2013 deprivation indices assess how far neighbourhoods lack all kinds of resources, not just income.",

      "bodyText": "The revelations that Donald Trump attempted to pressure Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden\u2019s family have reverberated through civil society and political circles in Kyiv, prompting some to ask if the United States can be viewed as a trustworthy ally in the country\u2019s attempts to reform and stave off pressure from Russia. Members of Ukraine\u2019s civil society and veterans communities on Thursday complained about the threat of withholding military funding and US political support to score points in domestic US politics. \u201cThis [whistleblower] complaint confirms all the worries that we had,\u201d said Daria Kaleniuk, the executive director of Ukraine\u2019s Anti-Corruption Action Centre. \u201cThis is very strange to have this pressure from a longtime ally of Ukraine, a request to interfere in an investigation from a country which was a role model for us for a long time. \u201cIt\u2019s coming at the exact moment when we finally have a chance to reform Ukrainian law enforcement agencies and make them free from political influence.\u201d Thursday\u2019s release of the whistleblower complaint gave additional details of Trump\u2019s use of executive resources to pressure the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to renew an investigation into the appointment of Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, to the board of a natural gas company in 2014. The whistleblower cites US officials saying that Trump directed Mike Pence not to attend Zelenskiy\u2019s inauguration in May and also \u201cmade clear\u201d that he did not want to meet Ukraine\u2019s president until he saw how Zelenskiy \u201cchose to act\u201d in office. In particular, the withholding of nearly $400m (\u00a3320m) in military and other aid to the country was seen as a politicisation of the conflict with Russia which has cost Ukraine thousands of lives and left some of Ukraine\u2019s territory under the control of Russian-backed separatists. \u201cPolitics should not affect whether our troops get what they need, supporting the guys who are out there,\u201d said Mykhailo, a veteran of the conflict who served in 2014 and 2015, who spoke on condition that his last name not be used. As one foreign diplomat noted, the money cannot simply be counted in terms of purchases of military hardware, because of Russia\u2019s broad superiority in firepower, but could be spent to improve training and on technology to save lives. Some support for Ukrainian soldiers still comes through crowdfunding efforts. While the revelations about Trump and Zelenskiy\u2019s talks have rocked political circles, media coverage of the scandal has been muted here \u2013 a sharp contrast to the wall-to-wall reporting of the revelations in the foreign press. The scandal here is seen mainly as an American affair, said political analysts, and unlikely to take support from Zelenskiy. Zelenskiy rode a wave of public support to the presidency this year, followed by a broad victory for his party, Servant of the People, which holds the first parliamentary majority in Ukraine\u2019s recent history. Recent approval ratings put his support at higher than 70%. On Maidan, where Ukraine\u2019s revolution began just under six years ago, ordinary Kyivans were broadly supportive of the president, saying that dealing with Trump would require Zelenskiy to be flexible and use \u201ccharm\u201d.

It started with the referendum. Brexit really seems to have empowered some people who feel this sort of language, and these sorts of threats, have become legitimised.</p> <p>\u201cIt can be tough. Let\u2019s be absolutely clear, we are very resilient. I reject those saying we are snowflakes and weak. Quite the opposite. We are very, very tough. To be a female MP, certainly in a marginal seat, isn\u2019t easy. The vast majority of us accept robust debate comes as part of our role, as well as constructive criticism. Unfortunately, so many cross the line with threats of violence, and sexual violence, and some are really offensive. I have had so many just this afternoon. One said \u2018you fat twat\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cIt can be wearing. You try to balance it against the good work you are doing and the supportive messages. You try to remember these people are quite sad really, keyboard warriors who take to the computer and start sending these toxic rants.</p> <p>\u201cI think you become a little bit inured to it. You must, because when I tell people outside politics that I probably had over 1,000 messages overnight, and maybe 200 were really, really offensive, people respond: \u2018Oh my God\u2019. Genuinely, I am quite matter-of-fact about it.</p> <p>\u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t shock me in the way it might have done three years ago when I did sometimes cry when I saw them. But now I rarely do. Now, it makes me feel angry, and it makes me feel really sad about where we are as a society, because I don\u2019t want the widespread feeling that it\u2019s just OK to abuse your MP, or indeed anybody in public office.</p> <p>\u201cI do fear with an election looming, it could get worse. I think everybody does. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jessphillips/status/1176953499411763200\">Jess Phillips tweeted </a>that she is not worried about an election, she is worried that somebody will kill her.

But if you are also female and from an ethnic minority background, the abuse has a different angle. And that has become worse since the referendum.</p> <p>\u201cYou are not just a \u2018traitor\u2019, you are a \u2018coloured traitor\u2019. It\u2019s not just about \u2018betraying\u2019 the country, it\u2019s about \u2018betraying the country that gave you a safe home\u2019. And then the old chestnut \u2018go home\u2019; \u2018If you\u2019re not going to deliver Brexit, go home\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cThe language people use matters. It matters that in the chamber the language [is] of traitors, of surrendering, of betrayal. But the language outside [the chamber], such as \u2018letterboxes\u2019, about painting the referendum as a proxy vote on immigration, that matters as well.</p> <p>\u201cThe abuse comes in all forms. It\u2019s not just from the general public, it\u2019s from the media as well. One article was headlined: \u2018Where do her loyalties really lie?\u2019 I was born in London, I\u2019m a politician in London, I grew up in London. What do you mean where do my loyalties really lie?</p> <p>\u201cThe abuse is on Twitter, in emails and in letters. I have had death threats, and they have been reported to the police.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no doubt that I am a lot more careful now than I was when I first started. That has a lot to do with the fact that Jo [Cox] was murdered. I think all of us were a little bit complacent before.</p> <p>\u201cWill an election make it any worse? Whether it\u2019s an election, or a campaign, it\u2019s about the tone that people from all sides take, especially at the top. The tone that the prime minister takes. It\u2019s about the general conduct. I think at election time, yes, of course, there is heightened emotion. There is more scrutiny of politicians. I think things are so tense at the moment, that can an election make it get any worse? I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Rushanara Ali, Labour MP for Bethnal Green and Bow</strong></h2> <p><em><strong>\u2018Politics of hate has been allowed to take centre stage\u2019</strong></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6389d611bae32bfb2e9e05880c1d34dcee93c860\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6389d611bae32bfb2e9e05880c1d34dcee93c860/0_267_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rushanara Ali.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rushanara Ali.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cLast year, I received one of those \u2018Punish a Muslim\u2019 letters which a number of people received. It contained a red liquid substance. It was horrible. I had to call the parliamentary police, who brought in a specialist team.</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t allowed to leave my office for a couple of hours while the liquid was analysed. The perpetrator was recently jailed for 12 years. When these things happen, it\u2019s hugely disruptive in all sorts of ways and all you want to do is just put it behind you and get on with the job but, equally, I feel we need to speak out about these threats.</p> <p>\u201cThreats and intimidation are not new to me \u2013 I\u2019m dealing with a very serious case at the moment which is with the CPS \u2013 but it has increasingly become commonplace for so many of us across parliament.</p> <p>\u201cThey are now even more widespread, and how could it be otherwise? We have a prime minister using language deliberately designed to incite violence and hatred.</p> <p>\u201cA lack of a moral compass among political leaders is dangerous, and yet the prime minister is leading the charge, deliberately causing chaos and putting people\u2019s lives at risk. That\u2019s what really worries me.</p> <p>\u201cThere are no boundaries now: the politics of hate has been allowed to take centre stage. Once we start to drive a wedge between people and bring the language of the far right into the mainstream, it becomes extremely difficult to undo the damage.</p> <p>\u201cSince the 2016 referendum, it does feel like threats have become more serious and more dangerous. What worries me most now is that we\u2019ve got certain public figures amplifying these tensions: it\u2019s one thing dealing with people directly threatening you but quite another when their hatred and anger is fuelled by political rhetoric.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Luciana Berger, Liberal Democrat MP </strong>for Liverpool Wavertree</h2> <p><em><strong>\u2018The threats are never-ending\u2019</strong></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7f261793f5361d82d7b68e19a69fbd29e5617fd3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f261793f5361d82d7b68e19a69fbd29e5617fd3/0_0_4708_2825/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Luciana Berger\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luciana Berger</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe threats come all the time. Because I\u2019m Jewish and a young woman, I have always had a disproportionate level of it but it\u2019s got worse. My security has been considerably ramped up to protect me physically and I try to insulate myself against the online abuse by being careful when I look at my emails, Facebook or my Twitter streams. But the threats are never-ending: you can\u2019t avoid them altogether.</p> <p>\u201cThe threats range from sinister and abusive to physically threatening. Ninety percent of the perpetrators are men but sometimes you can\u2019t tell: I got an email the other week to my parliamentary office that had been through such sophisticated malware that the police couldn\u2019t trace where it had come from.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to report threats to the police at least once a week. They called me yesterday about an ongoing case and I had to ask them to tell me which specific one they were calling about, there are so many. There have been six people convicted for harassment and threats directed at me, and there are more cases in the pipeline. Two people have been sent to prison, one of them for four years, one was given community service and one a suspended sentence.</p> <p>\u201cThe threats are toxic and they permeate our parliamentary debates. That\u2019s the norm today and it\u2019s given permission to those outside the chamber to amplify their hatred and abuse.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a prime minister and attorney general who boom toxic, divisive soundbites that are immediately posted on social media by the far right. It\u2019s a deliberate and planned strategy: someone behind the scenes is saying this will create the chaos we need to get the policies through that we want.\u201d</p>",

It\u2019s about the general conduct. I think at election time, yes, of course, there is heightened emotion. There is more scrutiny of politicians. I think things are so tense at the moment, that can an election make it get any worse? I don\u2019t know.\u201d Rushanara Ali, Labour MP for Bethnal Green and Bow \u2018Politics of hate has been allowed to take centre stage\u2019 \u201cLast year, I received one of those \u2018Punish a Muslim\u2019 letters which a number of people received. It contained a red liquid substance. It was horrible. I had to call the parliamentary police, who brought in a specialist team. \u201cI wasn\u2019t allowed to leave my office for a couple of hours while the liquid was analysed. The perpetrator was recently jailed for 12 years. When these things happen, it\u2019s hugely disruptive in all sorts of ways and all you want to do is just put it behind you and get on with the job but, equally, I feel we need to speak out about these threats. \u201cThreats and intimidation are not new to me \u2013 I\u2019m dealing with a very serious case at the moment which is with the CPS \u2013 but it has increasingly become commonplace for so many of us across parliament. \u201cThey are now even more widespread, and how could it be otherwise? We have a prime minister using language deliberately designed to incite violence and hatred. \u201cA lack of a moral compass among political leaders is dangerous, and yet the prime minister is leading the charge, deliberately causing chaos and putting people\u2019s lives at risk. That\u2019s what really worries me. \u201cThere are no boundaries now: the politics of hate has been allowed to take centre stage. Once we start to drive a wedge between people and bring the language of the far right into the mainstream, it becomes extremely difficult to undo the damage. \u201cSince the 2016 referendum, it does feel like threats have become more serious and more dangerous. What worries me most now is that we\u2019ve got certain public figures amplifying these tensions: it\u2019s one thing dealing with people directly threatening you but quite another when their hatred and anger is fuelled by political rhetoric.\u201d Luciana Berger, Liberal Democrat MP for Liverpool Wavertree \u2018The threats are never-ending\u2019 \u201cThe threats come all the time. Because I\u2019m Jewish and a young woman, I have always had a disproportionate level of it but it\u2019s got worse. My security has been considerably ramped up to protect me physically and I try to insulate myself against the online abuse by being careful when I look at my emails, Facebook or my Twitter streams. But the threats are never-ending: you can\u2019t avoid them altogether. \u201cThe threats range from sinister and abusive to physically threatening. Ninety percent of the perpetrators are men but sometimes you can\u2019t tell: I got an email the other week to my parliamentary office that had been through such sophisticated malware that the police couldn\u2019t trace where it had come from. \u201cWe have to report threats to the police at least once a week. They called me yesterday about an ongoing case and I had to ask them to tell me which specific one they were calling about, there are so many. There have been six people convicted for harassment and threats directed at me, and there are more cases in the pipeline. Two people have been sent to prison, one of them for four years, one was given community service and one a suspended sentence. \u201cThe threats are toxic and they permeate our parliamentary debates. That\u2019s the norm today and it\u2019s given permission to those outside the chamber to amplify their hatred and abuse. \u201cWe have a prime minister and attorney general who boom toxic, divisive soundbites that are immediately posted on social media by the far right. It\u2019s a deliberate and planned strategy: someone behind the scenes is saying this will create the chaos we need to get the policies through that we want.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Ministers may reintroduce financial incentives to attract people into nursing to help the NHS tackle its serious and worsening lack of nurses. The health service in England\u2019s shortage has spiralled to 40,000 vacancies since George Osborne abolished bursaries for would-be nurses and replaced them with student loans in 2015. This has led to 10,000 fewer people a year applying for nursing degrees in England and made it harder for hospitals to recruit homegrown nurses. In a major U-turn, the government and key NHS bodies in England are now examining ways in which they would bring back financial support for student nurses, including giving them cost of living grants of \u00a33,000 to \u00a35,000. Paramedics, podiatrists and other health professionals may be eligible to receive the inducements too, according to Health Service Journal, as the NHS is struggling to overcome major shortages of them as well. The Department of Health and Social Care has been discussing possible forms of funding with NHS England, Health Education England, the service\u2019s staffing agency, and NHS Employers, which represents England\u2019s 240 NHS trusts. They have also examined the merits of writing off debts nursing students have accrued doing a first degree. Until 2015 nursing attracted an high number of mature students, who often already had debts totalling tens of thousands of pounds from paying tuition fees for their first course. Applications have declined since then. Sources close to the discussions say ministers are cautious about endorsing \u201cdebt forgiveness\u201d as an inducement because it would cost too much money. Any financial incentives for nurses are likely to be made available only to certain groups, and not to everyone starting a three-year nursing degree. They would be targeted at mature students and those seeking to specialise in mental health and learning disability nursing, two areas in which workforce shortages are particularly acute. Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, has hinted at his support for reintroducing bursaries. Dame Donna Kinnair, the chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, welcomed the possibility of financial packages to persuade people to become nurses. \u201cSince the nursing bursary was removed we have seen a 29% fall in the number of applications to nursing degree course and 8% drop in the number of acceptances onto courses\u201d, she said.

The US said in May it had received numerous reports that appeared consistent with chemical exposure after an attack by Syrian government forces on Idlib province in north-west Syria, but it had made no definitive conclusion as to whether they used chemical weapons. The Trump administration has twice bombed Syria over Assad\u2019s suspected use of chemical weapons, in April 2017 and April 2018. The US, Britain and France launched airstrikes in April 2018 against what they described as three Syrian chemical weapons targets in retaliation for a suspected gas attack that killed scores of people in a Damascus suburb earlier that month. Assad launched an offensive at the end of April this year on Idlib and parts of adjacent provinces, saying insurgents had broken a truce. \u201cThis is different in some sense because it was chlorine \u2026 but know that President Trump has been pretty vigorous in protecting the world from the use of chemical weapons,\u201d Pompeo said, declining to say what the US response could be.

Women\u2019s participation rates are rising, and this season the Giants celebrated Haneen Zreika becoming the first Muslim woman to play the sport at the highest level. \u201cThe feeling is amazing,\u201d Zreika told Fairfax at the start of the AFLW season. \u201cRepresenting my own state and western Sydney is a big thing to me.\u201d Membership, too, is on the up, jumping from 25,243 in 2018 to 30,109 this year \u2013 half the number of their established city rivals, the Swans, but more than twice the size of the Gold Coast Suns, who entered the AFL the year before GWS but are yet to qualify for the finals and this season finished bottom of the ladder. \u201cRichmond has over 100,000 members and good on them, but it has taken them over 100 years to get there. We\u2019ve done it in only eight years,\u201d Shillito said. On the Gold Coast, the Suns were afforded much the same in terms of finance and talent concessions, but club officials will again spend the post-season wondering what they are doing wrong. And by comparison, what the Giants are doing right. On the field and off, Gold Coast seem light years away from making their mark in a region notorious for churn when it comes to sporting teams. Onto Saturday and the AFL\u2019s showpiece fixture. Richmond, the 2017 premiers, are firm favourites to beat the Giants, but this is familiar territory for a club accustomed to being the underdog. None of the originals \u2013 and as many as eight or nine foundation Giants could line up at the MCG \u2013 will forget the turbulent beginnings of a club that through its infancy was thrashed, mocked and dismissed as an expensive experiment. \u201cIt could end up the greatest story in sporting history in my lifetime,\u201d Sheedy said on Wednesday. Ever the salesman, Sheedy is right that winning the grand final would be a vindication of sorts. But there won\u2019t be a soul in the land of the Giants who\u2019ll be fooled into thinking success, or failure, will define them as a club. \u201cEven if we win, we won\u2019t be shutting shop and saying the job is done,\u201d Faraj says. \u201cThis is only the beginning. We\u2019re in it for the long haul.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Conservative Jim Molan\u2019s expected return to the Senate is set to be challenged as a candidate backed by the party\u2019s moderate faction gears up to fight for the plum position. Richard Shields, the deputy mayor at the Woollahra council and former state director for the Liberal party in New South Wales, is understood to have strong support among delegates to win the position being vacated by Arthur Sinodinos, and is widely expected to nominate. Another moderate candidate, Sutherland Shire councillor Kent Johns, is also considering whether to run for the vacancy created by Sinodinos\u2019s appointment as the next ambassador to the United States. Shields, the government relations manager for the Insurance Council of Australia, ran second in the contest to replace Malcolm Turnbull in the seat of Wentworth, which was won by Dave Sharma. Johns has twice been thwarted in his attempts to win preselection for the federal seat of Hughes, held by the conservative Craig Kelly, after prime ministerial interventions from Turnbull and Scott Morrison to save the sitting MP. The likely challenge to Molan comes despite Morrison writing to preselectors supporting Molan\u2019s return to the Senate after the former army general was relegated to the unwinnable fourth position at the last election. Molan angered many conservatives within the NSW branch after he ran a rogue campaign in the lead up to 18 May to convince people to disregard the Coalition\u2019s Senate ticket and vote below the line. That diminished factional support for Molan among the 800 delegates who will determine who takes the Senate position. Another complication is the fact that Shields used to be aligned with the party\u2019s hard right faction, meaning his support base crosses factional lines. Some moderates are understood to believe they should not run a candidate against Molan because whoever secures the two-year position will be up for renewal in 2022 at the same time as the moderate-aligned foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, and the conservative Concetta Fierravanti-Wells. Under the method used to select Senate candidates, it would not be possible for two moderate candidates to be allocated winnable positions, meaning the new senator may only be given a two-year term. The NSW state executive will meet on Friday to determine a timetable for the Senate vote, which is expected to take place in late November or December after parliament rises for the year.",

      "bodyText": "Centrelink could inflict more than one million new robodebts on welfare recipients over the next three years as the government seeks to meet the controversial data-matching scheme\u2019s budget targets, departmental projections provided to a Senate inquiry suggest. The projections are contained in a Department of Human Services submission defending the scheme, which also concedes compliance staff who carry out robodebt reviews are given \u201caspirational targets\u201d by their managers. Budget projections provided to the inquiry confirm figures in leaked confidential documents, revealed by Guardian Australia last month, showing the government would need to significantly ramp up the scheme to hit its $2.1bn fiscal savings target. The Senate submission says the department has now conducted 955,000 income reviews, of which 81% led to a debt being raised, but that it would need to carry out 1.6 million over the next three years to meet its budget projections. The department has projected it will conduct 500,000 in 2019-20, increasing to 550,000 in the following two financial years. It has averaged about 230,000 \u2013 or 4,500 a week \u2013 since 2015. On current trends, the 1.6 million projected income reviews would result in about 1.3 million robodebts being issued to past and current welfare recipients. This comes as the scheme faces fresh scrutiny following the announcement of a potential class action and as Centrelink increasingly uses new approaches, such as the use of tax garnishee notices, to claw back alleged debts. In its submission to the inquiry, the peak welfare body, the Australian Council of Social Service , said the scheme must be abolished. \u201cPeople have reported their life being ruined as a result of robodebt,\u201d it said in its submission. Data provided by the department also shows that a tiny proportion (4%) of disability pensioners and older Australians (3%) have been subjected to income reviews, and Centrelink has primarily targeted Newstart and Youth Allowance recipients, who made up 75% of all reviews completed so far. But the confidential documents, seen by Guardian Australia, revealed the department has recommended to the government services minister, Stuart Robert, that Centrelink now turn its sights to age pensioners and other welfare recipients considered vulnerable by the agency. This was the only way to meet the projected $2.1bn in savings, the department told Robert in the documents. The minister has said there is \u201cno proposal\u201d to expand the scheme to vulnerable Australians. Much of the criticism of the scheme, including an ongoing federal court challenge, has focused on the use of income averaging, whereby a person\u2019s annual pay reported to the tax office is spread across 26 fortnights to calculate a potential debt. But there have also been claims that staff are required to conduct a set number of reviews each week, while Nine News reported the existence of a whiteboard containing targets for income reviews within a Centrelink call centre. In the submission, the department repeated its position that staff \u201care not required to finalise a prescribed number of reviews each week\u201d. But it added: \u201cStaff are coached regularly and will set aspirational targets for review finalisations in line with their individual learning and development needs.\u201d The department said the \u201cfundamental elements\u201d of its approach to income compliance had been in place for decades and noted the Commonwealth Ombudsman had \u201ccommented positively\u201d on the scheme, which it has reformed three times since it was established in 2015. \u201cThe customer experience of today, with the current iteration of the online system, our improved letters and correspondence, and our dedicated support services, is vastly different to the experience when the program commenced in July 2015,\u201d the department said. The debt recovery program has reaped $1.9bn in fiscal savings since 2015, but with many of debts being paid back over plans, only $642.7m has actually been recovered.

      "bodyText": "Queensland taxpayers risk subsidising \u201ca foreign-owned unregulated monopoly asset\u201d if the state government signs a royalties agreement with Adani before securing access to the company\u2019s rail line, the Australia Institute says. The state government has set a self-imposed deadline of 30 September to finalise the terms of a royalty deferment with Adani. Both parties say negotiations over royalties are ongoing and confidential. Under a \u201ctransparent policy framework\u201d adopted by the state in 2017, Adani must provide multi-user infrastructure to be eligible to defer royalty payments. Guardian Australia has confirmed the Queensland Competition Authority, which regulates third-party use of private infrastructure, has not yet been asked to consider access arrangements. In a new report, the Australia Institute argues a royalty deal should not be signed until after the QCA has assessed the rail line. It estimates a royalties deferment could be worth $250m to $700m to Adani. In 2017 Queensland announced the new framework to offer favourable royalties packages \u2013 allowing payments to be deferred, with interest \u2013 to mining companies which were the first to build infrastructure in undeveloped areas. The secretive policy was considered a political masterstroke by the Labor government \u2013 allowing it to do a deal that would benefit Adani, while claiming it had kept an election promise not to give the company taxpayer subsidies or special treatment. In a statement released at the time, the government said projects approved for the royalties incentive must abide by certain principles, including the provision of \u201cthird-party access infrastructure\u201d. The state has been in negotiations with Adani about the details for more than two years, since the parties reached an in-principle agreement. Changes to the scale of the Carmichael project in the meantime have raised questions about whether Adani will still be eligible for a royalties deal under those principles. When the framework was announced, the Carmichael project was planned to include infrastructure considered critical to the development of the Galilee Basin \u2013 an airport, a rail line to the Abbot Point port and a second terminal at the port. Each has since been scrapped or shelved. Instead Adani will build a rail spur line linking the Carmichael mine to the Aurizon freight network. There are already concerns the rail plan leaves little to no additional capacity on the network. The Australia Institute\u2019s research director, Roderick Campbell, said the competition authority needed to work with Adani on access agreements \u201clike in all Queensland\u2019s rail lines and other significant infrastructure. \u201cOtherwise, there is no guarantee that Adani\u2019s rail can be used by other parties and is therefore not eligible for the royalty deferment,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cAdani shouldn\u2019t be treated differently to the rest of the coal rail network. \u201cThis is a worthy investment of time to ensure Queensland taxpayers are not left short-changed subsidising a rail line that would ultimately be a foreign-owned, unregulated monopoly asset. \u201cSubsidising coal mines as the world tackles climate change is bad enough. Subsidising coal mines and unregulated monopoly assets would be plain stupid.\u201d Negotiations between the Queensland government and Adani broke down last year, but resumed after the May federal election and after a shellshocked Labor pivoted in support of the coal industry. Guardian Australia understands the previous sticking point had been the government\u2019s insistence \u2013 and another requirement of the state policy \u2013 that Adani provide security for any deferred payments. It is unclear whether that has been resolved. The Queensland deputy premier and treasurer, Jackie Trad, said negotiations were ongoing and \u201cparties are working in good faith to meet the coordinator general\u2019s timeframe\u201d. Trad said another project, New Century Zinc, had already secured government approval for a royalty deal under the framework. \u201cThe (framework) principles seek to ensure that major new resource projects deliver secure local jobs at no cost to the taxpayer and all monies owed to the Queensland people through the use of our resources is paid in full,\u201d Trad said. \u201cAdani have advised that the commencement of construction of the Carmichael mine is not dependent on the finalisation of \u2026 negotiations.\u201d Adani said in a statement: \u201cWe are continuing to work with the Queensland government to finalise the royalties agreement. \u201cThe details of the royalties agreement are commercial in confidence.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Before the legislation to decriminalise abortion in New South Wales passed parliament on Thursday it underwent a number of last-minute changes that medical experts have branded as \u201cunnecessary\u201d but manageable. The amendments were passed by the legislative council during a marathon 40-hour debate on the new laws, which abolish a 119-year-old criminal provision and bring NSW into line with other Australian jurisdictions. The bill draws a distinction between the termination of a pregnancy before 22 weeks gestation, which are the vast majority of termination procedures, and those that occur after 22 weeks that will require the approval of two specialist doctors. The upper house adopted 25 of a possible 102 amendments, including a name change from the Reproductive Health Care Reform Bill 2019 to the Abortion Law Reform Act 2019. Many of the amendments, according to the Australian Medical Association, sought to codify existing medical policy. The organisation said it would work with government to ensure any potential confusion about the duplication did not cause patients to experience unnecessary delays. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that some unnecessary amendments were made but they should not be to the detriment of the bill\u2019s purpose \u2013 decriminalising abortion and maintaining access to this health service for those who need it,\u201d the AMA state president, Dr Kean-Seng Lim, said. What changed in the upper house? The AMA\u2019s concerns centred on amendments moved by the finance minister, Damien Tudehope, which include a new provision that a specialist medical practitioner \u201cmay ask for advice about the proposed termination from a multi-disciplinary team or hospital advisory committee\u201d. The concern was that legislating a doctor \u201cmay\u201d do something would create the impression that they should do it in all circumstances. It creates the appearance of oversight similar to that of an ethics committee, which is neither current practice nor required by this legislation. The Greens MP Jenny Leong, one of the architects of the bill, said that had the potential to frustrate the process. \u201cThe idea that there\u2019s an additional consideration now, which is something that the legislation says they have to consider, is something that puts an extra obstacle in,\u201d Leong said. She said the impact of that provision would have to be monitored. But both the AMA and Family Planning NSW said they were confident potential confusion could be managed. \u201cAlthough we may think [the amendments] are unnecessary, they do nothing to harm services and access to women in relation to terminations, and that\u2019s why we have agreed with them,\u201d the Family Planning NSW chief executive and adjunct professor Ann Brassil said. Another significant change is that doctors who have a conscientious objection to abortion will be allowed to provide a person seeking a termination with approved information from the health department, rather than referring them directly to another, non-objecting doctor. The Labor MP Penny Sharpe, who had carriage of the legislation in the upper house, said she would prefer that information be provided by the department. Brassil agreed, saying it was a \u201csensitive\u201d solution that would ensure women knew there was a public information resource on how to access a termination. Sharpe moved an amendment creating a new offence of using intimidation to coerce someone to either get, or not get, a termination. Other changes included: further defining informed consent; requiring that doctors provide \u201call necessary information\u201d about access to counselling; and requiring doctors to provide data on terminations to the health department within 28 days. Concerns about codifying misinformation Leong said she was concerned references in the bill to sex-selection abortion and terminations resulting in a live birth could be taken as \u201cactually codifying or validating\u201d conservative misinformation campaigns. One amendment inserts a new section titled \u201ccare of person born after termination\u201d which states that if a termination \u201cresults in a person being born\u201d then doctors are required to care for that baby. The legislation requires that the health department conduct a review after 12 months to determine whether any terminations on the basis of sex-selection have been conducted. The upper house amended that to include the line that parliament \u201copposes the performance of terminations for the purpose of sex selection\u201d. There is no credible evidence of sex-selection abortions in NSW. Despite those misgivings, Leong said the passage of the legislation was an \u201cincredible achievement.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that we saw some amendments that are not everything that we would want,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know that people will continue to try and have that control over people\u2019s bodies.\u201d",

It\u2019s a blockbuster that arrived too late for summer, but with the president obsessing, Congress investigating and main street America processing, the buzz around a whistleblower complaint about Donald Trump released early on Thursday appears likely only to grow. Some have predicted it will end with Trump impeached, the Republican party in tatters and multiple officials attached to the president and the White House out of jobs and possibly defending themselves against criminal charges. The Harvard constitutional law professor Laurence Tribe said attorney general William Barr had worked himself into a predicament on par with the attorney general under Richard Nixon. \u201cBill Barr is up to his eyebrows in the criminal conspiracy,\u201d Tribe tweeted. \u201cHe\u2019s Trump\u2019s John Mitchell.

In short, the complaint is a record of a months-long attempt by Trump to extract from Ukraine two silver bullets, one that would \u201cprove\u201d his opponents cheated in the last election, and one that would win him the next election. If that seems like a lot to hope for from Ukraine \u2013 if the plan seems a bit implausible, wild even \u2013 no one, of any political stripe, can be heard at the moment to be saying that it was a good plan. But the complaint indicates with damning detail that that was indeed the plan; that Trump went a long way toward carrying it out; that he was helped in his scheme by his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, as well as by lawyers and officials in the White House and apparently in the departments of justice and state allegedly including Barr; and that the Ukrainians had begun to try to understand what silver bullets Trump wanted and where they could get them, so as not to risk missing out on US aid worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Through a spokesperson, Barr has denied involvement. Speaking on Fox News, Giuliani has enthusiastically detailed his involvement, but said he was working at the behest of the state department, which the state department has denied. What appears to have so alarmed career government ethics and oversight officials, however, is the extent to which the now released complaint reveals that Trump\u2019s ethical rot, as they perceive it, has spread beyond the Oval Office, beyond the White House, beyond the cabinet and through the government. Among its many revelations, the complaint says in a footnote that somebody in the White House is in the habit of taking transcripts of Trump\u2019s conversations out of the relatively accessible system where they normally would be filed and putting them into a standalone \u201ccodeword-level\u201d computer system normally reserved for America\u2019s top secrets \u201csolely for the purpose of protecting politically sensitive \u2013 rather than national security sensitive \u2013 information\u201d. Trump used to have a safe for hush money deals he made with women that was kept by a friend who published the National Enquirer. The complaint indicates that that same arrangement is still in effect, only now the deals have to do with Trump\u2019s political enemies, and the safe is the one they usually use to keep records for things like flying five helicopters into Pakistan at midnight. The overriding sense is there were a lot of people involved in a scheme by the president to both tamper in an upcoming election and to prosecute political opponents, with the help of a foreign government, secured in part by holding up hundreds of millions of dollars in aid previously appropriated by Congress. The whistleblower complaint says it is based on the account of \u201cmore than half a dozen US officials\u201d. In accurately describing the contents of a 25 July phone call between Trump and the Ukrainian president \u2013 though the whistleblower was not on the call \u2013 the complaint says \u201capproximately a dozen White House officials\u201d and at least one state department official listened to the call. After that, \u201cmultiple\u201d state department and intelligence officials were briefed on the call, the complaint says. The complaint indicates knowledge of guilt on the part of officials involved, describing a \u201c\u2018discussion ongoing\u2019 with White House lawyers about how to treat the call because of the likelihood, in the officials\u2019 retelling, that they had witnessed the president abuse his office for personal gain\u201d. That knowledge of guilt appears to have endured for months. According to the complaint, seven months before the July phone call, Giuliani met in New York with a Ukrainian prosecutor who later made public statements propping up both a conspiracy theory threatening to Joe Biden and a conspiracy theory accusing Democrats of collaborating with Ukraine to throw the 2016 election. Those were the two silver bullets Trump was after, as made plain in a summary of the July call released on Wednesday. The Ukrainian prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, was valuable, and Trump leaned on the new Ukrainian president to hold him over, the complaint alleges. Trump brought up the prosecutor in the July phone conversation, according to the summary, and received assurances from the Ukrainian president that he would put the right man on the job. It appears, then, that Trump made an effort to sow corruption in the Ukrainian government, by pressuring the president to appoint a prosecutor general preferred by Trump for that prosecutor\u2019s willingness to hunt for Trump\u2019s silver bullets or maybe to make some. Meanwhile a lot of people in the US government knew about this plan, and had watched its mechanisms unfold, according to the whistleblower complaint. \u201cAttorney general Barr appears to be involved as well,\u201d the complaint alleges. Yet while Barr allegedly participated in the Ukrainian plan \u2013 although he denies having contacted Ukrainian officials at Trump\u2019s behest, as Trump repeatedly assured the Ukrainian president Barr would \u2013 Barr also is actively overseeing justice department inquiries relating to the plan, including one internal inquiry that determined that the plan did not violate campaign finance laws banning campaigns from accepting anything \u201cof value\u201d from foreign sources.

      "body": "<p>The risk that politicians, other public figures or ordinary people taking part in political activities could be physically attacked is the most urgent but not the only reason to be alarmed by the divisive stance adopted by the prime minister following the supreme court ruling against him. With every <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/26/boris-johnson-refuses-to-apologise-for-language-about-jo-cox\" title=\"\">contemptuous act</a> or incendiary choice of words, Boris Johnson inflicts further damage on our democracy and makes it harder to see how the divisions of Brexit can ever be healed.</p> <p>He and his party have now sunk to a new low. Care must always be taken in linking words with actions. But the murder of Jo Cox in 2016, police warnings about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/19/fastest-growing-uk-terrorist-threat-is-from-far-right-say-police\" title=\"\">rising far-right threat</a>, and the huge increase in online and other abuse, would lead any responsible leader to treat people\u2019s fears with respect. Anti-Brexit lawyer Jolyon Maugham revealed on Thursday that, on police advice, he has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/sep/26/supreme-court-litigant-advised-to-buy-stab-vest-after-death-threats\" title=\"\">installed a panic button</a> and bought a stab vest. Yet Mr Johnson appears intent on sowing further discord, repeatedly referring to the Brexit extension sought by parliament as a \u201csurrender bill\u201d \u2013 a phrase that appears calculated to provoke English nationalists to fury. When MPs urged him to moderate his language, pointing out that such phrases appear in the death threats and abuse they receive, he dismissed their concerns as \u201chumbug\u201d. On Thursday he failed to turn up to answer questions about these exchanges. </p> <p>The difficulties now confronting the UK are enormous, and disagreements about the best way forward are fierce. But to reject Mr Johnson\u2019s demagoguery, as MPs including his former cabinet colleague Justine Greening did on Thursday, is not to place style over substance. It is to recognise that rhetoric can be dangerous, and one of a prime minister\u2019s tasks is to set the tone.</p> <p>Politicians of all parties, commentators and others have their part to play. Prorogation was an outrage, but it was not a coup, and Mr Johnson is not a dictator. In such conflicted times, metaphors such as \u201cdrive-by shooting\u201d, \u201cpull the trigger\u201d or \u201cdecapitation\u201d can take on disturbing connotations. At the extreme, abuse and threats, online and in real life, come from the left as well as the Brexit-supporting right.</p> <p>Given the political and constitutional impasse, with the Queen and supreme court drawn into politics in a way that few people would have imagined, it is not hard to see how things could get worse. Mr Johnson\u2019s populist posture, and particularly his embrace of a strongman persona that is toxic to many female parliamentarians, makes comparisons with President Trump inevitable. We don\u2019t yet know how the public views the reversal of the prorogation, but we know how the prime minister is trying to portray it. Thankfully, British broadcasters bear little resemblance to the highly partisan US networks.</p> <p>Britain is in the midst of a crisis. The vote for Brexit exposed and deepened social divisions, but also revealed flaws in our institutions. Electoral reformers have long argued for changes that would see us move towards a more consensual and less tribal politics, as well as introducing democracy to the House of Lords. Female politicians in particular have argued that the adversarial, debating-society aspect of the House of Commons is out of date, and contributes to the sense of alienation from Westminster by sections of the public.</p> <p>Consideration of such questions lies in the future. For now, the priority must be to stop Mr Johnson from causing more harm. Those Conservative colleagues who have stood by him so far must now speak up against a slide into antagonism that appears as calculated as it is reckless.</p>",

With every contemptuous act or incendiary choice of words, Boris Johnson inflicts further damage on our democracy and makes it harder to see how the divisions of Brexit can ever be healed. He and his party have now sunk to a new low. Care must always be taken in linking words with actions. But the murder of Jo Cox in 2016, police warnings about the rising far-right threat, and the huge increase in online and other abuse, would lead any responsible leader to treat people\u2019s fears with respect. Anti-Brexit lawyer Jolyon Maugham revealed on Thursday that, on police advice, he has installed a panic button and bought a stab vest. Yet Mr Johnson appears intent on sowing further discord, repeatedly referring to the Brexit extension sought by parliament as a \u201csurrender bill\u201d \u2013 a phrase that appears calculated to provoke English nationalists to fury. When MPs urged him to moderate his language, pointing out that such phrases appear in the death threats and abuse they receive, he dismissed their concerns as \u201chumbug\u201d. On Thursday he failed to turn up to answer questions about these exchanges. The difficulties now confronting the UK are enormous, and disagreements about the best way forward are fierce. But to reject Mr Johnson\u2019s demagoguery, as MPs including his former cabinet colleague Justine Greening did on Thursday, is not to place style over substance. It is to recognise that rhetoric can be dangerous, and one of a prime minister\u2019s tasks is to set the tone. Politicians of all parties, commentators and others have their part to play. Prorogation was an outrage, but it was not a coup, and Mr Johnson is not a dictator. In such conflicted times, metaphors such as \u201cdrive-by shooting\u201d, \u201cpull the trigger\u201d or \u201cdecapitation\u201d can take on disturbing connotations. At the extreme, abuse and threats, online and in real life, come from the left as well as the Brexit-supporting right. Given the political and constitutional impasse, with the Queen and supreme court drawn into politics in a way that few people would have imagined, it is not hard to see how things could get worse. Mr Johnson\u2019s populist posture, and particularly his embrace of a strongman persona that is toxic to many female parliamentarians, makes comparisons with President Trump inevitable. We don\u2019t yet know how the public views the reversal of the prorogation, but we know how the prime minister is trying to portray it. Thankfully, British broadcasters bear little resemblance to the highly partisan US networks. Britain is in the midst of a crisis. The vote for Brexit exposed and deepened social divisions, but also revealed flaws in our institutions. Electoral reformers have long argued for changes that would see us move towards a more consensual and less tribal politics, as well as introducing democracy to the House of Lords. Female politicians in particular have argued that the adversarial, debating-society aspect of the House of Commons is out of date, and contributes to the sense of alienation from Westminster by sections of the public. Consideration of such questions lies in the future. For now, the priority must be to stop Mr Johnson from causing more harm. Those Conservative colleagues who have stood by him so far must now speak up against a slide into antagonism that appears as calculated as it is reckless.",

For all their appeals to enduring moral values, whether US exceptionalism or legal principle, the centrists are deploying a transparent strategy to return to power. Trump\u2019s shambolic presidency somehow seems less unsavoury than the fact that neither of these sides are able to admit how massively his election signified the failure of their policies, from endless war to economic inequality. Leftwing members of Congress such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders have long been in favour of impeaching Trump. But they have not made it a daily obsession. Even as Washington teemed with talking points about the phone call, Ocasio-Cortez introduced a bold plan to fight poverty; Sanders proposed a new wealth tax the day before. Progressives are right to worry that what matters most is not whether Trump committed an \u201cimpeachable offence\u201d (which means no more than that enough members of the House of Representatives will vote to indict him), but instead what political vision Democrats can rally behind to win the country, rigged system and all. Given the importance of that question, the current debate about whether to impeach Trump, for all the melodrama around it now, pales in comparison. Centrists simply want to return to the status quo interrupted by Trump, their reputations laundered by their courageous opposition to his mercurial reign, and their policies restored to credibility. Meanwhile, rightwing Republicans hope to benefit from his ascendancy, doubling down on tax cuts. No wonder progressives\u2019 greatest fear is allowing the first group to return to the failed policies that produced Trump himself, and the second to capitalise on his rise to entrench their rule indefinitely. Al Green, a Democratic congressman from Texas who was a lonely early proponent of impeaching Trump, commented the other day that his approach was vital precisely because it would help to win the next election. In his press conference on Wednesday, the president jeered in return. Trumpeting his own success \u2013 however unearned \u2013 in promoting economic growth, he interpreted impeachment as the strategy of a party that has nothing else to offer. \u201cAll of these people focusing on the witch-hunt because they can\u2019t beat us at the ballot,\u201d he exclaimed with some delight. Who is right \u2013 Green or Trump? The Ukraine affair shows that the biggest risk to the American people is that centrists link impeachment to a reinstatement of one set of failed prescriptions, while the right repulses the attempt to oust the president and rules under equally dead-end policies. And it shows that progressives must link opposition to Trump to a broader strategy to bring the country a convincing new politics of their own. \u2022 Samuel Moyn is a professor of law and history at Yale and the author, most recently, of Not Enough: Human Rights in an Unequal World",

They will wear capes in the colours of 45 different bus liveries from years past and skate in various formations \u201cto represent the various levels of coordination or chaos between bus companies over the decades\u201d, she said. Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, has called for more control over local bus services and is expected to open a public consultation later this autumn on bus franchising. A report commissioned by the major bus companies operating in Manchester claimed earlier this month that if Burnham brought the buses back under public operation it would cost every household in the region up to \u00a368.10 each year. Bus Regulation: The Musical is at Manchester Art Gallery this Saturday at 2pm. Tickets are free but need to be booked in advance.",

Jennifer Arcuri\u2019s company Hacker House was awarded a \u00a3100,000 cyber-skills grant intended for UK-operating businesses in January even though she and her business partner husband had relocated to California last year. The digital minister, Matt Warman, told MPs on Wednesday that \u00a353,000 of the grant yet to be paid to the company would be frozen until the government had completed its review, which it launched this week.

Companies House confirmed that it did not receive the online application for Hacker House\u2019s address change until 4.10pm \u2013 meaning it was made hours after MPs quizzed Warman in the Commons on the company\u2019s eligibility for the grant.

      "bodyText": "A government fund under investigation for handing money to a business owned by a close associate of Boris Johnson has given \u00a368,000 to a company that funds a Conservative minister\u2019s private salary. Grants given by the cybersecurity immediate impact fund are being reviewed after it emerged that Jennifer Arcuri\u2019s company Hacker House was awarded \u00a3100,000 earlier this year. Questions have arisen about the company\u2019s eligibility for the fund, which is for the UK-based applicants, after it emerged that Arcuri lives in the US and calls to her company\u2019s business number are diverted to a US reception. Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, has demanded the review should include a payment of \u00a368,424 given to Crucial Academy Ltd, which is paying \u00a385,000 a year to Johnny Mercer, a Tory MP and ally of the prime minister. Johnson appointed Mercer as minister for military personnel in July. Watson has raised concerns that the firm is ultimately funded by Surge Financial, which was paid for marketing a failed bond scheme, losing thousands of savers \u00a3236m. Paul Careless, the owner of Surge Financial, was arrested in June by officers investigating the collapse of London Capital &amp; Finance. In a letter sent to the culture secretary, Nicky Morgan, Watson wrote that he raised concerns in April about a grant-in-aid payment of \u00a368,423.93 to Crucial Academy made by the government fund. \u201cCrucial Academy is ultimately funded by Surge Financial Ltd, which took a 25% commission for marketing bonds from the corrupt London Capital &amp; Finance Ltd (LCF). \u201cAlmost 12,000 people put \u00a3230m into LCF which entered administration earlier this year. The administrators have found a number of \u2018highly suspicious transactions\u2019 to a small interconnected group of people who ended up with large sums of investors\u2019 money in their own personal coffers. Crucial Academy also employed Johnny Mercer for \u00a385,000,\u201d Watson wrote. In the letter seen by the Guardian, he said both grants were associated with \u201cquestionable business practices\u201d and had connections to politicians. \u201cThis raises questions about the appropriate use of public funds and the due diligence systems in place,\u201d he said. Mercer, a former army officer, stood down as a non-executive director at Crucial in June and was appointed as an executive director instead. He has maintained the same salary, despite becoming a defence minister. Mercer told the Guardian he knew about the grant to Crucial but had not known which fund it came from. \u201cI was proud of my work as a non-executive director for Crucial Academy \u2013 an exciting project facilitating veterans into cybersecurity after a career in the military,\u201d he said. After the Guardian pointed out that he was still registered as a director at Companies House, Mercer said he would be stepping down from Crucial after discussing the job \u201cjust this week with the permanent secretary in the Ministry of Defence\u201d. A spokesman for Surge Financial said: \u201cAt no point did Surge ever touch a single penny of LCF bondholders\u2019 money. Surge is a third-party marketing company that was paid a fee for providing a range of services to LCF.\u201d A spokesman for Crucial Academy said: \u201cDue process was followed in every grant application.\u201d Arcuri, an American who moved to London seven years ago, was given \u00a3126,000 in public money and was treated to privileged access to three foreign trade missions led by Johnson while he was mayor of London. The government has confirmed it has frozen a \u00a3100,000 grant to Hacker House, pending a review by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. The money, which was awarded earlier this year, was intended to foster digital skills in the UK. The government\u2019s claim that it properly verified the grant appeared to be unravelling this week amid mounting evidence about the company\u2019s tenuous links to the UK. After a minister said necessary checks on the firm to ensure it was UK-based involved verifying it had \u201ca British phone number\u201d, the Guardian called the number and got through to a US-based member of staff who would not confirm her exact location. According to LinkedIn, only four of the 11 employees recorded on the site are located in the UK, and one of them is Arcuri, who moved to the US last year.",

But it cannot be the whole story - arch-rival Tui has coped because its finances are healthier.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Weather</b><br>The summer heatwave of 2018 encouraged would-be holidaymakers to stay at home, undermining prices in the \u201clates\u201d market where operators try to clear unsold holidays. There seems to have been a hangover into 2019, with customers calculating that waiting to book is a productive strategy.</p>\n    <p><b>Competition</b><br>A pincer movement of Airbnb and budget holidays has changed consumer behaviour, though Thomas Cook still managed to sell 11m package holidays last year.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Banks and debt</b><br>The tour operator has been attempting to shoulder a&nbsp; huge pile of debt for the past decade \u2013 \u00a31.7bn worth at the last count. Successive managements failed to remove meaningful chunks. The banks argue they have supported an overstretched company for years and the details of why it could not be saved may have to await the report from the Insolvency Service.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Bad management</b><br>Thomas Cook\u2019s borrowings were too high. The moral of the tale is that tour operators should fund themselves conservatively.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s my colleague Gwyn Topham on BA\u2019s troubled relations with its pilots. British Airways pilots have warned the airline that it risks prompting more strikes after BA blamed industrial action for falling profits and took a \u20ac137m hit from the walkouts. International Airlines Group warned of a 6% drop in annual profits after revealing the high cost of strikes this month that led to more than 2,000 flight cancellations. Balpa, the pilots\u2019 union, said its BA members believed the carrier\u2019s management was \u201ctreating them with contempt\u201d, and had asked Balpa to consider more strike dates. The FTSE 100 is on track to finish at an eight-week high - even though today\u2019s financial results are mostly bad. President Trump\u2019s trade war optimism is helping - even though it\u2019s light on detail, and perhaps aimed at distracting the markets from this week\u2019s whistle-blower revelations. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: Putting them all to shame was the FTSE, which let rip with a 100 point surge, leaving it at 7380 and near an 8-week peak. This despite some serious casualties amongst its ranks: Pearson fell 14% on problems in its US higher education courseware business; Imperial Brands shed 11% thanks to fears surrounding the crackdown on vaping in America; and IAG lost 3.5% as it took a heavy hit from the month\u2019s pilot strike. Keeping the FTSE buzzing was its commodity sector, obviously influenced by Trump\u2019s trade deal rumours, alongside the continued misery of sterling. The pound failed to make any in roads regarding a recovery of yesterday\u2019s losses; instead the currency spent much of the day flat, paralysed by all the recent talk of a general election. We have ANOTHER profits warning - our fourth of the day. Cruise operator Carnival Corp has cut its full-year profit forecast (for the third time), and warned that higher fuel prices will hurt earnings. The company said it now expects adjusted earnings of $4.23 to $4.27 per share in 2019, down from its earlier forecast of $4.25 to $4.35 per share. It cites recent geopolitical events (such as the attack on Saudi Aramco\u2019s massive oil production facilities) for pushed crude prices up. Shares in Carnival have dropped by 8% in London, Just in: Thomas Cook\u2019s CEOs, directors and auditors are to be investigated by MPs keen to discover who is to blame for its collapse. The House of Commons Business, Energy and Industrial Strateg Committee has just announced it will hold an inquiry into Thomas Cook, starting in mid-October. Rachel Reeves MP, chair of the committee, says the \u201csorry tale of corporate greed\u201d needs to be exposed (Thomas Cook\u2019s three CEOs were paid over \u00a335m in the last 12 years, before the firm collapsed owing \u00a31.7bn on Monday). \u201cAmid the frustration of holidaymakers and the misery of thousands of staff losing their jobs, the collapse of Thomas Cook has uncovered what appears to be a sorry tale of corporate greed, raising serious questions about the actions of Thomas Cook\u2019s bosses and their stewardship of the business. This latest corporate failure has shone a light once again on the use of aggressive accounting methods to aid bumper pay-outs to company executives and the apparent inability of auditors and regulators to curb these practices in the wider interests of shareholders, investors, and the public. \u201cThe BEIS Committee has a long-standing interest in corporate governance, executive pay, and audit reform which we are keen to follow up in this inquiry. The main players in the sad demise of Britain\u2019s oldest travel firm should face public scrutiny and be held to account for their actions before the company collapsed.\u201d Bad news for British Airways. Balpa, the pilots union, says its members are asking for more strike dates to be considered. Balpa says BA hasn\u2019t responded for calls for meaningful negotiation, following the cancellation of tomorrow\u2019s industrial action. Reminder: IAG warned this morning that any additional strikes would have a further impact on profitability. The latest US GDP data confirms that America\u2019s economy slowed in the last quarter. US GDP expanded by an annual rate of 2.0% in April-June, the Bureau of Economic Analysis says, down from 3.1% in January-March. That matches earlier estimates. However, there\u2019s two notable changes: Business investment shrank by 1.4%, not the 1.1% first estimated. Government spending increased by4.8% pace, up from 4.5% first reported. The FTSE 100 continues to shake off this morning\u2019s profit warnings, with the blue-chip index now up 82 points or 1.1% at 7372. Kerstin Braun, president of trade finance group Stenn Group, an international provider of trade finance, says traders are clinging onto Donald Trump\u2019s claim that a trade deal with China could some sooner than expected. We\u2019ve heard optimism from the White House before, of course, but still.... \u201cThe jitters generated by the ongoing, and seemingly never-ending, US-China trade war are felt in all corners of the globe, and the UK is no exception. Uncertainty is bad for business as companies are unable to plan for the future, while critical investments and market development activities are put on hold. Governments, investors and businesses are all crying out for some calm in the global economy, and today\u2019s rise in the FTSE 100 reflects that.\u201d Brexit news: Jaguar Land Rover, has decided to halt production at its British factories for a week in November. The move will give Britain\u2019s biggest carmaker some breathing space in case Britain crashed out of the UK without a deal on 31 October. More here. The car industry has already been disrupted once by Brexit this year - moving the usual August shutdowns to April, to coincide with the first Brexit deadline. Beyond Meat has done it again. Shares in the plant-based burger market are surging 14% in pre-market trading, after it signed a deal with fast food giant McDonalds in Canada. McDonalds will sell the \u201cPLT\u201d burger -- standing for Plant. Lettuce. Tomato -- in 28 restaurants in Southwestern Ontario, in a 12 week trial. Ann Wahlgren, McDonald\u2019s Vice President of Global Menu Strategy, saysL \u201cMcDonald\u2019s has a proud legacy of fun, delicious and craveable food\u2014and now, we\u2019re extending that to a test of a juicy, plant-based burger. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working on our recipe, and now we\u2019re ready to hear feedback from our customers.\u201d However, it appears the PLT won\u2019t be cooked on a separate grill than McDonald\u2019s meaty burgers, so it won\u2019t be properly vegetarian. Beyond Meat\u2019s shares have been pretty craveable this year. The company floated at $25 per share in May, and surged to $234 by late July as investors tried to cash in on the boom in vegetarian and vegan food. They then fell back, to $138 last night, but are set to sizzle again today. Newsflash: The euro has sunk to its lowest level since May 2017, following a shock resignation from the European Central Bank last night. The euro sagged to \u20ac1.0923, a 28-month low, as traders digest Sabine Lautenschl\u00e4ger\u2019s resignation. Lautenschl\u00e4ger is (soon to be was) Germany\u2019s representative on the European Central Bank\u2019s executive board. She\u2019s not revealed why she\u2019s quit, but analysts have concluded she is unhappy with the ECB\u2019s increasingly loose monetary policy. It slashed one of its key interest rates to a new record low two weeks ago, and incoming president Christine Lagarde is expected to maintain this approach. Lautenschl\u00e4ger is the fourth German policymaker to quit the ECB since it was created two decades ago. Chief economist J\u00fcrgen Stark and Bundesbank President Axel Weber both resigned in 2011, followed by board member J\u00f6rg Asmussen. German Conservative MEP Markus Ferber says Lautenschl\u00e4ger will be a loss: \u201cThe resignation of Sabine Lautenschl\u00e4ger is a setback for the ECB board. Sabine Lautenschl\u00e4ger has always been a central banker with backbone, who has never been shy of expressing inconvenient truths. Today, such voices are needed more than ever in the ECB Board. Over in Amsterdam, Dutch bank ABN Amro has revealed it\u2019s being investigated for possible breaches of the Netherlands\u2019 money laundering and terrorism financing legislation. In a short statement, ABN Amro revealed that Dutch prosecutors are probing its conduct, adding: \u201cABN Amro will cooperate fully with the probe\u201d Shareholders aren\u2019t impressed; shares in ABN Amro have slumped almost 10% Dutch finance minister Wopke Hoekstra is also concerned, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s extremely worrying that ABN Amro is under investigation by prosecutors.\u201d The operation to repatriate Thomas Cook passengers, and crew, continues -- amid anger over the rescue of its German airline. The Civil Aviation Authority has reported that the majority of Thomas Cook air crew members who were abroad when the company collapsed have been returned home. The CAA is also flying another 17,000 passengers home today, on 71 flights organised through Operation Matterhorn. Some 46,000 people have already been returned home since Monday - the day Thomas Cook collapsed. While Thomas Cook is now in the hands of the Insolvency Service, it\u2019s German airline, Condor, is still operating thanks to a \u20ac380m loan from the German government. Condor is profitable (unlike Thomas Cook itself, which lost \u00a31.5bn earlier this year). But staff who have lost their jobs are understandably unhappy, especially after Thomas Cook executives were filmed being applauded by Condor staff, and grinning broadly. Christoph Debus, Thomas Cook\u2019s chief airlines officer, has apologised.... Despite this morning\u2019s triple-profit warning drama, the FTSE 100 has actually risen by almost 1% this morning. IAG, Pearson and Imperial are all dragging it down, of course, but that\u2019s been countered by other stocks rallying. Once again, traders are grasping hopes of a breakthrough in the US-Chine trade war. President Trump fanned optimism last night, telling reporters that Beijing was desperate to reach an agreement. \u201cThey want to make a deal very badly... It could happen sooner than you think.\u201d This has lifted markets across Europe: Multinational companies listed in London are also benefitting from the weaker pound, as it makes their overseas earnings more valuable. Sterling has dropped to $1.2326 this morning, nearly a two-week low, as Britain\u2019s Brexit-induced political crisis plumbs new, dank, depths. Around \u00a32bn has been wiped off the value of Imperial Brands this morning, after it warned that America\u2019s e-cigarettes market has turned sour. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, explains why Imperial\u2019s shares have slumped 10%: \u201cIt is not a good time to be a vaping company. Political and regulatory pressures are coming down hard on the sector and resulting in fewer US retailers and wholesalers ordering or promoting vaping products. Competition is also fierce, particularly in places like Australia. \u201cTobacco companies like Imperial Brands have bet everything on vaping and other smokeless alternatives being the future of their business. While the public has been slowly switching from cigarettes to smoke-free products, there is a growing negative backlash in other circles caused by concerns over the large number of younger people vaping and the potential health threats. Here\u2019s our news story about IAG\u2019s warning on profits. IAG\u2019s gloom about passenger growth, and falling demand at its budget airlines, have hurt the wider airline sector. Neil Wilson of Markets.com explains: IAG has warned profits will be significantly lower as a result of pilot strikes. BA pilot strikes left 2,325 flights cancelled at a cost of \u20ac137 million, while threatened strikes by Heathrow staff cost \u20ac33m. IAG also flagged \u2018adverse booking trends\u2019 in its low-cost divisions (which we assume is code for, not enough bums on seats), which will hit the bottom line to the tune of \u20ac45m. Capacity growth for the fourth quarter is now expected to be about 2% which is 1.2 points below previous guidance, and full year capacity growth is expected to be about 4%, down from previous guidance for 5% growth. Shares fell over 3% to 463.8p. The extent of the IAG warning has had an impact on the rest of the sector, with shares in EasyJet and Ryanair also down around 2%. IAG, Pearson and Imperial Brands have all slumped to the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard after this morning\u2019s profit warnings. Shares in British tobacco company Imperial Brands are also being hammered in early trading, after it issued a profits warning. Imperial has been hit by the regulatory backlash against vaping in the United States, dashing hopes that e-cigarettes would deliver growth. Imperial told shareholders that US trading \u201chas deteriorated considerably\u201d, as US states target vaping. This has prompted a marked slowdown in the growth of the vapour category in recent weeks, with an increasing number of wholesalers and retailers not ordering or not allowing promotion of vaping products. Imperial\u2019s shares have crashed by over 9%, dragging rival BAT down by over 3%. Educational publisher Pearson\u2019s shares have slumped by almost 15% at the start of trading, after it also warned on profits. Pearson told investors that full-year earnings would be at the bottom of its guided range (\u00a3590m to \u00a3640m). It blaming weaker than expected trading in its U.S. higher education courseware business in the key selling season. Pearson blamed \u201ca significant industry wide acceleration of print attrition\u201d - in other words, students are abandoning paper textbooks at a rollicking rate. Pearson has been shifting towards new digital and online products, but clearly it\u2019s a struggle to get right. CEO John Fallon says: \u201cThe third quarter has been significantly weaker than we expected in US Higher Education Courseware. Whilst difficult in the short term this places more importance on our work to remake this part of Pearson and we are exploring new ways of deploying our new technology platform so that we can offer students highly affordable, convenient, adaptive, digital courseware. Shares in IAG have fallen by over 3% at the start of trading. A poor start, but not the worst...... IAG has also warned shareholder that there have not been any further talks between British Airways and BALPA over the pilots pay row. That means we could see further strikes, which would take another large bite out of profits (on top of the \u20ac137m hit reported today). IAG says: The airline\u2019s offer of a 11.5 per cent pay increase over three years still stands and has been accepted by British Airways\u2019 other unions, representing 90 per cent of the airline\u2019s employees. Clearly any further industrial action will additionally impact IAG\u2019s full year 2019 operating profit. IAG and BALPA spent most of 2019 negotiating, before an offer worth 11.9% over three years was rejected. Pilots argued they should get a profit share scheme, as IAG\u2019s directors do, plus an above-inflation pay guarantee. Good morning, and welcome to the rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. A hat-trick of profits warnings have hit the City this morning, led by IAG, the parent company of British Airways. IAG brought shareholders down to earth with a bump this morning - by revealing a \u20ac215m hit to its earnings. Much of the damage was caused by pilot strikes on the 9th and 10th of September, plus another strike scheduled for tomorrow which was called off. This forced BA to cancel thousands of flights. It also relaxed its rebooking rules to help customers. In all, the pilot strikes have cost \u20ac137m (\u00a3121m) of lost profits. It told shareholders: During September, BALPA\u2019s (British Airways main pilots\u2019 union) industrial action initially scheduled for the 9, 10 and 27 led to an initial cancellation of 4,521 flights over a period of seven days. Subsequently, 2,196 flights were reinstated leaving 2,325 cancellations. British Airways also introduced flexible commercial policies on 4,070 flights not directly affected by the industrial action. These policies enabled customers to re-book flights or receive a refund. The net financial impact of the industrial action is estimated to be \u20ac137 million. The threat of separate strikes by Heathrow Airport employees also hit earnings, IAG adds, costing the company \u20ac33m. But that\u2019s not all.... It also warns that \u201cthe latest booking trends\u201d at its budget airlines, including Spanish operator Vueling Airlines, have deteriorated. This will have \u201can adverse financial impact of \u20ac45 million\u201d, it says, taking the total hit to \u20ac215m. That\u2019s quite a headache for IAG, especially as it still hasn\u2019t resolved the pay row with its pilots. But IAG isn\u2019t alone. Tobacco firm Imperial Brands and publisher Pearson have also just warned that earnings are weaker than expected - a worrying sign for the markets. More to follow....

They follow below:</p> <p>\u201cI rarely actually tweet, especially about politics \u2013 am more of the silent retweeter \u2013 but after the chilling scenes in Parliament last night I just don\u2019t think I can stay quiet anymore. There\u2019s a group of young people and children that need to be spoken for.</p> <p>\u201cThe language used by our Prime Minister - not a far-right populist or provocative journalist, but our Prime Minister - is just beyond words. The fact that the head of our government is actually using language that helps incite violence toward MPs is so beyond dangerous I can\u2019t even comprehend it in a modern society. This isn\u2019t funny any more. Whatever egotistical game Boris Johnson has been playing since he was at Eton, this isn\u2019t entitled teenagers standing blindly by their positions in an attempt to one-up their friends anymore.</p> <p>\u201cThis of rising hatred is costing people their lives.</p> <p>\u201cI was 17 when Jo Cox was murdered. I just rang my mum, who is Yvette Cooper, on my way home from school to complain about the usual things and I distinctly remember her interrupting me to say \u2018An MP\u2019s been shot.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cI can honestly say my perspective of the world completely changed that day. Before then, my mum\u2019s job was something that kept her working later than bedtime when I was a kid, the source of embarrassing conversations at school, the reason we travelled to and fro between Yorkshire and London every week for the first two thirds of my life.</p> <p>\u201cIt was never something that could get her killed.</p> <p>\u201cI am scared.</p> <p>\u201cI am scared when I scroll through the replies to her tweets calling her a liar and a traitor.</p> <p>\u201cI am scared when our house gets fitted with panic buttons, industrial-locking doors and explosive bags to catch the mail.</p> <p>\u201cI am scared because on the 16th of June 2016, two children said goodbye to their mother before she left for her constituency to sit in surgeries and help people all day, and never saw her again. I am scared every single day that the same will happen to mine.</p> <p>\u201cBecause she is trying her best to help people. To make their lives better. Even if we disagree with our politicians, when was this something we actively wanted to hurt them for?</p> <p>\u201cOf course Brexit is contentious. Of course people have strong opinions, opinions that will inevitably come into conflict when trying to work out how best to deliver an outcome that split our country in two. But what we need now is a Prime Minister who can stand up and say \u2018Yes I want to deliver Brexit, but regardless of my position, this inflammatory and aggressive language needs to stop. We need to treat each other with humanity and respect.\u2019 Boris Johnson, take a stand. It\u2019s your job to unite the country.</p> <p>\u201cOr you will be responsible for putting other people\u2019s lives at risk.</p> <p>\u201cSurely you can raise your head out of the sand enough to see that much?</p> <p>\u201cThis whole thing has gone too far. When people start getting hurt is the moment that we should step back and ask if any of this is even worth it. All the anger and the screaming and the taking sides. The traitors and the liars and the surrendering.</p> <p>\u201cWhy has this become a matter of life and death? Does someone have to die for us all to realise that we have gotten in far too deep and far too aggressively?</p> <p>\u201cThe thing is, someone already has died. Do we not have the decency and compassion to see that? Can we not all just treat each other like people again?</p> <p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m terrified if we don\u2019t that something awful is going to happen again. At this rate, that seems like the only thing that could stop us in our tracks. We need to change the way we act towards our MPs before it goes too far because if not I have no doubt it will.\u201d</p>",

Whatever egotistical game Boris Johnson has been playing since he was at Eton, this isn\u2019t entitled teenagers standing blindly by their positions in an attempt to one-up their friends anymore. \u201cThis of rising hatred is costing people their lives. \u201cI was 17 when Jo Cox was murdered. I just rang my mum, who is Yvette Cooper, on my way home from school to complain about the usual things and I distinctly remember her interrupting me to say \u2018An MP\u2019s been shot.\u2019 \u201cI can honestly say my perspective of the world completely changed that day. Before then, my mum\u2019s job was something that kept her working later than bedtime when I was a kid, the source of embarrassing conversations at school, the reason we travelled to and fro between Yorkshire and London every week for the first two thirds of my life. \u201cIt was never something that could get her killed. \u201cI am scared. \u201cI am scared when I scroll through the replies to her tweets calling her a liar and a traitor. \u201cI am scared when our house gets fitted with panic buttons, industrial-locking doors and explosive bags to catch the mail. \u201cI am scared because on the 16th of June 2016, two children said goodbye to their mother before she left for her constituency to sit in surgeries and help people all day, and never saw her again. I am scared every single day that the same will happen to mine. \u201cBecause she is trying her best to help people. To make their lives better. Even if we disagree with our politicians, when was this something we actively wanted to hurt them for? \u201cOf course Brexit is contentious. Of course people have strong opinions, opinions that will inevitably come into conflict when trying to work out how best to deliver an outcome that split our country in two. But what we need now is a Prime Minister who can stand up and say \u2018Yes I want to deliver Brexit, but regardless of my position, this inflammatory and aggressive language needs to stop. We need to treat each other with humanity and respect.\u2019 Boris Johnson, take a stand. It\u2019s your job to unite the country. \u201cOr you will be responsible for putting other people\u2019s lives at risk. \u201cSurely you can raise your head out of the sand enough to see that much? \u201cThis whole thing has gone too far. When people start getting hurt is the moment that we should step back and ask if any of this is even worth it. All the anger and the screaming and the taking sides. The traitors and the liars and the surrendering. \u201cWhy has this become a matter of life and death? Does someone have to die for us all to realise that we have gotten in far too deep and far too aggressively? \u201cThe thing is, someone already has died. Do we not have the decency and compassion to see that? Can we not all just treat each other like people again? \u201cBecause I\u2019m terrified if we don\u2019t that something awful is going to happen again. At this rate, that seems like the only thing that could stop us in our tracks. We need to change the way we act towards our MPs before it goes too far because if not I have no doubt it will.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The international trade secretary admitted the UK had breached for a third time a court order banning the sale of weapons to Saudi Arabia, which could be used in violations of international law in the conflict in Yemen. Responding to an urgent question, Liz Truss told the Commons that officials had discovered a further violation, 10 days after she was forced to write to the court of appeal admitting two other export licences had been unlawfully granted. Truss said: \u201cWe have identified one further licence that has been granted in breach of the undertaking,\u201d prompting the SNP to call for her resignation and Labour to ask how the sales were signed off in the first place. Ministers had agreed in June to halt arms exports to Saudi Arabia of weapons that could be used in the war in Yemen, after a landmark court ruling that the sales could be in breach of international humanitarian law. Despite that commitment, an emergency review by Truss\u2019s department discovered that civil servants had authorised a contract to repair equipment used by the Saudi army to detect improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Truss offered \u201can unreserved apology\u201d for the breach, added that the export licence to Saudi Arabia had not been used, \u201chas now been revoked\u201d and put the blame on a lack of communication between government departments. An estimated 18,292 civilians have been killed or injured as a result of indiscriminate bombing by the Saudi-led coalition embroiled in the civil war in Yemen, according to research conducted by the Yemen Data Project. Saudi land forces are also based in the country, intervening in support of the Yemeni government which is fighting primarily against Houthi rebels, backed by Iran.

      "bodyText": "The European parliament has rejected EU commissioner candidates from Hungary and Romania over alleged conflicts of interest, in a blow to the incoming president, Ursula von der Leyen. The unprecedented move by MEPs ratchets up pressure on Von der Leyen, who must get her team of 26 EU commissioners approved next month if her new commission is to be ready for its launch day on 1 November. In a closed-door meeting, MEPs on the European parliament\u2019s legal affairs committee rejected Romanian socialist Rovana Plumb and Hungarian Fidesz party appointee, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Tr\u00f3cs\u00e1nyi. Both were deemed to have a conflict of interest and denied permission to take part in hearings in front of the relevant European parliament committee, the next and essential step in becoming a European commissioner. The committee approved the remaining candidates, allowing 24 would-be commissioners to be questioned in a series of hearings due to begin on Monday. Von der Leyen and her team of 26 commissioners \u2013 one from each EU member state (excluding Brexit Britain) \u2013 can only take office after a vote by the European parliament scheduled for late October. While the parliament usually rejects one or two individuals for a weak performance in the three-hour hearings, this is the first time it has rejected candidates before those public encounters. The show of strength is the result of a 2016 rule change to tighten scrutiny of potential conflicts of interest. Responding to the decision, Tr\u00f3cs\u00e1nyi said he had answered all the questions asked of him \u201cin a transparent fashion\u201d and warned of legal action. \u201cIn the case of the Hungarian commissioner-designate, a political decision was made lacking any factual basis, and I fully intend to take all necessary steps against it.\u201d The former diplomat, appointed to Hungary\u2019s dream job of commissioner for enlargement and relations with neighbouring countries, had already been warned he faced \u201ca rough ride\u201d from liberal MEPs over his record in constructing Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s legal order. Plumb, nominated to lead EU transport policy, was reported by the Romanian press to have allegedly taken out loans that she later donated to the ruling party. She was rejected by 15 votes to six with two abstentions. Plumb told the Romanian media she had answered the legal affairs committee\u2019s questions with \u201cclarity and openness\u201d and had not received any official decision from the parliament. She did not immediately respond to the Guardian\u2019s request for comment. In theory both candidates could still become EU commissioners if they satisfy the parliament they have no conflict of interest in their new roles. But their suspension could prompt their governments to nominate alternative candidates.

It\u2019s been a blast, from T20 to World Cups to Ashes to a championship that went to the wire, between its two best teams who even amid ridiculous autumn weather managed to rustle us up a finish today with some twists and turns, particularly turns on a textbook Ciderabad pitch. Congrats Essex, commiserations Somerset, and thanks to everyone including you, our readers, for a wonderful long summer of cricket. See you again soon. Bye.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d8ce7d78f081108db9bd650\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-26T16:46:25.162Z\">5.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Alastair Cook speaks:</strong> \u201cWhen I got out I thought I was going to have another bat today. No disrespect to our lower order but it was difficult out there. I\u2019ve got experience in the subcontintent and managed to find a method out there, but not all of them do. But it\u2019s not about me today it\u2019s about the proper Essex unit, we have a good time together, and Tendo [Ryan Ten Doeschate] has been absolutely brilliant as well as Anthony McGrath [the coach]. That\u2019s why I carried on playing \u2026 \u201c then he breaks off to say, \u201cI really want to go here because I don\u2019t want to miss those celebrations.\u201d He looks so much more casual, relaxed and chatty compared to the latter days of his England captaincy and career.</p> <p>Tom Abell, the Somerset captain, has his say: \u201cThat middle session we gave ourselves a chance but it wasn\u2019t meant to be. The supporters have been phenomenal, and the atmosphere was incredible when we got those wickets to get us ourselves a chance. Over a championship season the best team will prevail, so well done to Ryan and Essex. The square\u2019s very dry here and we\u2019ve got great spinners and we always felt if we had enough time there\u2019d be chances. We\u2019re gutted but have to say congratulations to Essex. We\u2019re stull desperate for that championship win and it\u2019ll certainly fuel the fire for next year</p> <p>On Trescothick: \u201cI don\u2019t think any words can do him justice. It\u2019s an impossible void to fill, a great player for Somerset and England,and more importantly, he\u2019s a great person. A mentor to so many of us and great to have around.\u201d</p> <p>Ten Doeschate starts his own interview with a Trescothick tribute too before adding: \u201cWe got a bit lucky with the weather this week, and it\u2019s been a long and tiring and testing season. The belief in the team, particularly the young guys, is second to none, Our cricket hasn\u2019t always been pretty this year, but McGrath has been instrumental in getting the batting together and saying, \u2018lads, we\u2019re gonna score more runs this year even if it isn\u2019t always pretty.\u2019 Peter Siddle dragged the bowlers along, Cook and Porter, and it was good to see players like Aron Nijjar come on. And we can\u2019t look too far past Mr Simon Harmer. He\u2019s led the team with his attitude and he walks the walk. It\u2019s been a monumental effort.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d8ce6948f08fbb0c171c17e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-26T16:29:54.007Z\">5.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>So anyway, what a second half of the season Essex have enjoyed</strong>. They were more thereabouts than there in the early stages of the season, but came on strongly when the championship resumed in the closing weeks, despite not strengthening as some did (and losing Peter Siddle, who played his part early on). Simon Harmer was their undoubted player of the season, but he was well backed up with the seamers Sam Cook and Jamie Porter, and a batting order that has sufficient depth and reliability during a season of often harem-scaring batting everywhere and in all forms.</p> <p>Somerset will be getting sick of being runners-up, and will see that skittling by Kyle Abbott in Southampton as the turning point for them, but they won a trophy too this term, and remain one of our most admirable county sides. One who, like Essex, have been cut out of the Hundred \u2013 so these two carving up the honours this season feels like delicious karma.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d8ce5e98f08fbb0c171c172\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-26T16:24:36.556Z\">5.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>They let Trescothick walk off </strong>in front of all the others.

It was a card game producing, runs, wickets and occasional dot balls. As an enthusiastic scorer in those days, the innings scores produced were highly unlikely. My brother and I developed this game into a more authentic scored game by using a deck of playing cards. Jokers were wicket taking balls, and therefore \u201cappeals\u201d, though depending on the quality and current performance of the batsman, they could be protected by the appearance of certain court cards after the appeal and so given not out. A much better and realistic score card could be produced, and many holidays were spent playing and working out season averages for many chosen players. teams.

All the lower case vowels were dot balls, \u2018m\u2019 was bowled, \u2018P\u2019 run out, \u2018V\u2019 four runs etc. I added realism by giving players a chance to survive a wicket by rolling a dice, the score needed to stay in based on their career average versus the bowler\u2019s average, and even had some rules I can\u2019t remember now for speeding up the score in one day games. I replayed entire real life test series and fantasy games with my favourite players picked from around the world, with the scores recorded in exercise books for posterity.</p> <p>Now that I\u2019m just the wrong side of 50, I haven\u2019t played the game properly for several decades, but often dream of starting up again when I retire. I still play a bit though. I played so often as a teenager that I can now remember what all the letters score.

I did the same with the \u2018how out\u2019 possibilities (in a different-coloured crayon).<br><br>I then stuck a pin in the middle and then onto a board, spun the disc and as it fell against a mark on the board, played the game.<br><br>I used to score the matches in a proper scorebook, with made-up teams of my favourite players, and would often play entire Test series (usually England against Rest of the World.<br><br>I\u2019d do this throughout the summer when it was raining.

      "bodyText": "Well, it\u2019s not easy to sum up this season in a few words. It\u2019s been a blast, from T20 to World Cups to Ashes to a championship that went to the wire, between its two best teams who even amid ridiculous autumn weather managed to rustle us up a finish today with some twists and turns, particularly turns on a textbook Ciderabad pitch. Congrats Essex, commiserations Somerset, and thanks to everyone including you, our readers, for a wonderful long summer of cricket. See you again soon. Bye. Alastair Cook speaks: \u201cWhen I got out I thought I was going to have another bat today. No disrespect to our lower order but it was difficult out there. I\u2019ve got experience in the subcontintent and managed to find a method out there, but not all of them do. But it\u2019s not about me today it\u2019s about the proper Essex unit, we have a good time together, and Tendo [Ryan Ten Doeschate] has been absolutely brilliant as well as Anthony McGrath [the coach]. That\u2019s why I carried on playing \u2026 \u201c then he breaks off to say, \u201cI really want to go here because I don\u2019t want to miss those celebrations.\u201d He looks so much more casual, relaxed and chatty compared to the latter days of his England captaincy and career. Tom Abell, the Somerset captain, has his say: \u201cThat middle session we gave ourselves a chance but it wasn\u2019t meant to be. The supporters have been phenomenal, and the atmosphere was incredible when we got those wickets to get us ourselves a chance. Over a championship season the best team will prevail, so well done to Ryan and Essex. The square\u2019s very dry here and we\u2019ve got great spinners and we always felt if we had enough time there\u2019d be chances. We\u2019re gutted but have to say congratulations to Essex. We\u2019re stull desperate for that championship win and it\u2019ll certainly fuel the fire for next year On Trescothick: \u201cI don\u2019t think any words can do him justice. It\u2019s an impossible void to fill, a great player for Somerset and England,and more importantly, he\u2019s a great person. A mentor to so many of us and great to have around.\u201d Ten Doeschate starts his own interview with a Trescothick tribute too before adding: \u201cWe got a bit lucky with the weather this week, and it\u2019s been a long and tiring and testing season. The belief in the team, particularly the young guys, is second to none, Our cricket hasn\u2019t always been pretty this year, but McGrath has been instrumental in getting the batting together and saying, \u2018lads, we\u2019re gonna score more runs this year even if it isn\u2019t always pretty.\u2019 Peter Siddle dragged the bowlers along, Cook and Porter, and it was good to see players like Aron Nijjar come on. And we can\u2019t look too far past Mr Simon Harmer. He\u2019s led the team with his attitude and he walks the walk. It\u2019s been a monumental effort.\u201d So anyway, what a second half of the season Essex have enjoyed. They were more thereabouts than there in the early stages of the season, but came on strongly when the championship resumed in the closing weeks, despite not strengthening as some did (and losing Peter Siddle, who played his part early on). Simon Harmer was their undoubted player of the season, but he was well backed up with the seamers Sam Cook and Jamie Porter, and a batting order that has sufficient depth and reliability during a season of often harem-scaring batting everywhere and in all forms. Somerset will be getting sick of being runners-up, and will see that skittling by Kyle Abbott in Southampton as the turning point for them, but they won a trophy too this term, and remain one of our most admirable county sides. One who, like Essex, have been cut out of the Hundred \u2013 so these two carving up the honours this season feels like delicious karma. They let Trescothick walk off in front of all the others. The great Somerset opener waves his cap to all corners of the ground, and is given a parade in by the entire Essex team. Before the plaudits for Essex begin in earnest, let\u2019s salute this wonderful cricketer, and pioneering player off the field as well. Make that no minutes to go. The teams agree to call it quits. Essex have their second title in three years, and their second trophy this season. 18th over: Essex 45-1 (A Cook 30, Westley 1) target 63. A grubber from Van der Merwe deflects off Cook\u2019s pads, beats a rusty Trescothick at leg slip and goes for four leg byes. A clip to deep midwicket brings another single. For what it\u2019s worth, TV replays suggest Cook had another let-off in the previous over, when rapped in front by Bess. He\u2019s had a charmed life today. Ten minutes to go, 18 needed. Or nine wickets. 17th over: Essex 40-1 (A Cook 29, Westley 1) target 63. Aw, here\u2019s lovely. Somerset signal their concession of the title by subbing on Marcus Trescothick, who gets a rousing reception from the whole ground, and his aura brings a wicket, Browne edging Bess to slip. Westley is off the mark with a single. Leicestershire and Lancashire have shaken hands on a draw, which means, fittingly, that this is the only match of the 2019 English and Welsh cricket season still going. Marcus Trescothick comes on as sub and his very presence conjures a wicket, as a teasing Bess delivery finds Browne\u2019s edge and Vijay at slip does the rest. 16th over: Essex 38-0 (Browne 10, A Cook 28) target 63. Chants of \u201cCampeones\u201d fill the air as Browne drives Van der Merwe square on the offside for four. Go for the win lads. Go crazy. It\u2019s in the bag now. A first double for the county since 1985\u2019s John Player League/Natwest Trophy double (both won with last-over heartstoppers). 15th over: Essex 33-0 (Browne 5, A Cook 28) target 63. A change of ends for Bess, who replaces Leach and turns one off-break sharply past Browne, who responds by clipping firmly to leg for one. Marcus Trescothick is pacing the boundary, edgily, on drinks duty. How we\u2019ll miss him. 14th over: Essex 32-0 (Browne 4, A Cook 28) target 63. A firm clip from Cook in front of square off Van der Merwe brings three. Go on Sir Al, go for the win. I\u2019ve seen him get a T20 hundred before (one of my claims to fame). Van der Merwe changes to round the wicket for Browne, who adds one more to the score by rocking back and turning it to leg. Somerset\u2019s bowlers need a right-hander in. 13th over: Essex 28-0 (Browne 3, Cook 25) target 63. The previous over\u2019s run glut hasn\u2019t altered Somerset\u2019s field placings. There are four men close in on the legside and two on the off, plus the keeper. Browne is unfazed though, and even tries to hit out when a rare full toss is sent his way, which he only clobbers straight to mid-on. No run. 12th over: Essex 28-0 (Browne 3, Cook 25) target 63. Van der Merwe is brought into the attack, as fielders continue to swarm round the bat. Of course every nudge, squirt and push that beats them brings runs, and Cook gets two more on the legside with no more than a simple prod. He\u2019s playing with a record-breaker\u2019s authority and pulls two short-ish deliveries to the square leg boundary for four. The last ball of the over is excellent though, pushed through quicker and Cook pushes forward off the inside edge and it falls agonisingly short of silly point. In one over, the dial has moved again, and an Essex victory has loomed into view, as a Somerset one recedes. 11th over: Essex 18-0 (Browne 3, Cook 15) target 63. Leach isn\u2019t going to die wondering when it comes to appealing. Every time he raps the pad he has a shout of some sort, as he does here after hitting Browne outside the line. He\u2019s bowling well though, varying pace and turn, but so far these openers have been equal to him. Browne adds two more with a thick-edged drive square on the offside. Apparently, the quickest any team has been bowled out was Derbyshire in 8.3 overs in 1939. 10th over: Essex 16-0 (Browne 1, Cook 15) target 63. Bess continues, as Van der Merwe warms up. He\u2019s accurate enough, but not getting wickets yet. Cook picks up two twos with clips through the legside. Essex need 47 runs, Somerset need 10 wickets. Neither happening gives Essex the title, as does a victory for the visitors, obv. 9th over: Essex 12-0 (Browne 1, Cook 11) target 63. Aaron Nijjar has his pads on in the dressing room. So does Dan Lawrence. Is this telling us something about Essex\u2019s batting strategy, or just that they\u2019re all so anxious that they\u2019ve strapped their pads on. Anyone who\u2019s ever played low-level Sunday cricket on bobbly surfaces knows that feeling. Cook\u2019s above all that though, and he drives Leach handsomely through the covers for four, adding one more by coolly rocking back and turning the ball to square leg. A minimum of 10 overs remain, as do 41 minutes. 8th over: Essex 7-0 (Browne 1, Cook 6) target 63. Bess troubles Cook with one that\u2019s a good full length, keeps low, and pings past his outside-edge. The knighted one then calmly adds a single with a clip through midwicket. Bess then bothers Browne with a similar ball to that which vexed Cook at the start of the over, but doesn\u2019t find an edge. Essex have batted with reasonable composure so far \u2013 but I said that in the first innings, and then look what happened. 7th over: Essex 5-0 (Browne 1 Cook 5) target 63. Cook plants his front foot forward and pads up outside the line of off to Leach, who responds with an understandably overambitious appeal. Cook takes a flicked single, and Browne plays out the over well. They\u2019re absolutely rattling through these overs, but no point doing that if you\u2019re not going to get anyone out. 6th over: Essex 5-0 (Browne 1 Cook 4) target 63. Bess finds some more extravagant turn away from the left-handed Browne, who leaves well. He\u2019s not, yet, looking as threatening as Van der Marwe did with the older ball an hour or so ago, and Essex will \u2013 anxiously, tentatively - be pleased to see another over go by without a wicket. 5th over: Essex 5-0 (Browne 1 Cook 4) target 63. Cooke is off the mark with a flick down to fine leg for four, and then sees out the over. Dot balls are all golden balls to Essex at the moment. \u201cIt strikes me that Esssex have tottaly lost the plot here,\u201d thunders John Withington. \u201cMissed a great chance to attack with the field all around the bat in the first innings. With wickets tumbling it was the obvious thing to do to seek to close the gap and close the game out. But now, sending Cook and Brown out to block out they\u2019re effectively inviting Somerset to bowl 20 overs at them. They should have had an early dash and kept Cook back to block out later if needed. The pitch is a joke of a spinners\u2019 dream so why would you simply play to the opponent\u2019s strength.\u201d I half-agree but it\u2019s easier said than done, on this pitch, and against this attack. 4th over: Essex 1-0 (Browne 1 Cook 0) target 63. Bess bamboozles Browne with a lovely leg-break past the left-hander in a tidy over that\u2019s a maiden. Essex showing no sign of going for the target so far, though they\u2019ve not been given a chance to thanks to some fine bowling. \u201cIt\u2019s been an epic summer, no matter what the result of this match is,\u201d trills Abhijato Sensarma, perhaps this season\u2019s most prolific OBO emailer-iner. \u201cWhat a time to be alive; what a conclusion to be witnessing! If there\u2019s one thing the season\u2019s taught us, it\u2019s that it\u2019s not over till it\u2019s over ... Fasten your seatbelts, folks. Let\u2019s get ready for one last ride.\u201d 3rd over: Essex 1-0 (Browne 1 Cook 0) target 63. Essex are on their way! Browne calmly pushes Leach away through the legside for a single. Then a big appeal for a catch off the glove at short leg but umpire Wharf turns it down; it\u2019s off pad, I think. We\u2019re into the last hour \u2013 a minimum of 16 overs will now ensue. 2nd over: Essex 0-0 (Browne 0 Cook 0) target 63. Somerset opt for an all-spin new-ball attack as we reach Peak Ciderabad. Bess it is who gets his first bowl for a while, pushing them through at a fair old pace to Cook, who\u2019s getting forward confidently, though pushing hard at the ball served Essex poorly in their first-innings collapse. Another maiden. 1st over: Essex 0-0 (Browne O Cook 0) target 63. Boozy chants of \u201cSomerset la, la, la\u201d fill the air at a more-than-half-full looking Taunton (worth piling down there now if you\u2019re in the vicinity) as the home side take the field. Nick Browne and Alastair Cook are out there again, Leach has the ball in hand again. Men are crouched round the bat en masse again. And one of them nearly takes a catch! Browne nudges to short leg and a diving Vijay can\u2019t grasp it in time. A fine maiden. What a sport this is. Ravaged by rain for most of its four days, it\u2019s still capable of conjuring a tense, memorable finish. \u201cI know I will probably be seen as a cricket illiterate,\u201d says Jack Baker-Merry, \u201cand it is exactly what Somerset will be hoping for, but I would be tempted to go for runs if I were Essex, and try and get the 63 before Somerset can get the 10.\u201d I\u2019d love for them to do it that way \u2013 nerves of steel needed though. As predicted, Somerset give their second dig a swerve, and invite Essex to chase 63 in the last hour or so. But given that they\u2019ve just taken nine in 19 overs or so, it\u2019s by no means safe for Essex now. Is this incredible cricket season going to have one last crazy twist? 68.2 overs: Essex 141 (Porter 0 not out), trail by 64. Wheater plays a trademark sweep off Van der Merwe for four, as Essex realise they now need runs to mitigate the menace of any Somerset first-innings lead. But then he\u2019s gone, bottom-edging to Davies behind the stumps. It\u2019s Van der Merwe\u2019s fourth scalp. Somerset lead by 62 68 overs: Essex 137-9 (Wheater 8, Porter 0), trail by 64. Nijjar, in his first first-class game for four years, is back in the pavilion after becoming Leach\u2019s fourth victim. And Sam Cook is his fifth, first ball, with a fuller, quicker ball that the batsman never came close to picking. Jamie Porter survives the hat-trick ball, not without alarms, edging sharply to the very close gully but it goes through his hands. Essex have now lost eight wickets for 35 runs. Leach is on a hat-trick, clattering little chef\u2019s stumps first ball. What are we seeing here? Leach turns one into Nijjar, who misses and sees it rap him in front. Replays suggest it was turning so sharply it was perhaps just clipping leg. 67 overs: Essex 137-7 (Wheater 8, Nijjar 2), trail by 64. Wheater pushes at Van der Merwe and it squirts down past long-leg for four. A similarly unconvincing boundary comes in the same area when Wheater inside-edges an on-drive. It\u2019s getting a bit gloomy overhead again. \u201cInteresting discussion on games based on cricket,\u201d emails Simon Porter. \u201cI remember buying a game called \u201ccrickcard\u201d in the early 1960s - A game supposedly endorsed by one Trevor Bailey. It was a card game producing, runs, wickets and occasional dot balls. As an enthusiastic scorer in those days, the innings scores produced were highly unlikely. My brother and I developed this game into a more authentic scored game by using a deck of playing cards. Jokers were wicket taking balls, and therefore \u201cappeals\u201d, though depending on the quality and current performance of the batsman, they could be protected by the appearance of certain court cards after the appeal and so given not out. A much better and realistic score card could be produced, and many holidays were spent playing and working out season averages for many chosen players. teams. Is it very sad that I can remember it all so well?\u201d Yes, but in a good way. Be proud of yourself. 66 overs: Essex 129-7 (Wheater 0, Nijjar 2) Essex might have to think about trying to score some runs here, and Wheather can certainly do that, though he faces an ambitious lbw appeal from Leach after being struck akwardly on the pad to one that was going down leg. It yields a leg-bye. The left-handed Njjar then gets off the mark with an expansive on-drive/mow for tour. 65 overs: Essex 126-7 (Wheater 0) A double-wicket maiden for Van der Merwe, and batting suddenly looks even harder on this surface. The last hour starts at 4.30? How is this going to pan out? Another one! Simon Harmer \u2013 Saturday\u2019s batting hero \u2013 is flummoxed by one that spits up at him and can only fence it to Vijay at second slip. IS IT ON AGAIN? Ooh, now what we have we here? The well-set Westley nudges an excellent delivery from Van der Merwe to Lewis Gregory to first slip. It was pushed right in on him, forcing him to play, and then turned to take the edge. Somerset now have a fighting chance of bowling Essex out at least and having another bat/forfeit. 64 overs: Essex 126-5 (Westley 36, Wheater 0) Jack Leach picks up his third wicket, that of Ten Doeschate, and he nearly snares the new man, Adam Wheater, who pushes hard and edges to Murali Vijay at second slip, but it bounces in and out of his hands. A measure of just how close in the fielders are. Excellent over from Leach. Another one for Leach, finding a thick edge from Ten Doeschate, who\u2019s not looked particularly at ease, and Abell takes it at silly point. 63 overs: Essex 126-4 (Westley 36, Ten Doeschate 4) Ten Doeschate offers a slight chance to first slip after Van der Merwe turns one into him, but if drops short. An uppish cut for two that clears the infield ensues. By the way, in the only other game where they\u2019ve not just cut their losses and gone to the bar, Leicestershire are 191-3 in their second innings against Lancashire, leading by 176. 62 overs: Essex 123-4 (Westley 36, Ten Doeschate 1) Ten Doeschate turns Leach round the corner to get off the mark with a single. They\u2019re still crowding the bat, an expression of hope over realism at this stage, but it keeps the score down. Wonder if Essex will manage to get a batting point. 61 overs: Essex 122-4 (Westley 36, Ten Doeschate 0) So the final session of this glorious season gets under way, in bright sunshine. Van der Merwe continues, and Westley plays him well, mostly getting forward to meet the spin before it turns too extravagantly, as it has been doing all afternoon. And when Van der Merwe strays in his line, Westley can rock back and cut for four past point. Westley looks well placed to see this one home now. Anyway, the players are back out. Book cricket \u2013 it wasn\u2019t just me being an oddball. Others were being oddballs too. Like David Blythe: Just saw your mention of book cricket. Aged about 13 I found a version of this in an old Eagle annual I bought at a jumble sale. All the lower case vowels were dot balls, \u2018m\u2019 was bowled, \u2018P\u2019 run out, \u2018V\u2019 four runs etc. I added realism by giving players a chance to survive a wicket by rolling a dice, the score needed to stay in based on their career average versus the bowler\u2019s average, and even had some rules I can\u2019t remember now for speeding up the score in one day games. I replayed entire real life test series and fantasy games with my favourite players picked from around the world, with the scores recorded in exercise books for posterity. Now that I\u2019m just the wrong side of 50, I haven\u2019t played the game properly for several decades, but often dream of starting up again when I retire. I still play a bit though. I played so often as a teenager that I can now remember what all the letters score. Many is the time a dull work presentation or subtitled foreign film has been livened up by playing a couple of test matches, totting up the scores in my head. And James Falla: Tom \u2013 I discovered \u201cBook Cricket\u201d as you call it in a vintage Eagle Annual when I was about 12. It dominated much of the next 20-odd years of my life, especially waiting for judgements in Magistrate\u2019s Court as a young newspaper reporter! For what it\u2019s worth, this was my realistic alphabet a \u2013 dot b \u2013 1 c \u2013 2 d - e \u2013 dot f \u2013 1 g \u2013 dot h \u2013 1 i \u2013 dot j \u2013 OUT k \u2013 OUT m \u2013 4 n \u2013 dot o \u2013 dot p \u2013 1 q \u2013 OUT r \u2013 dot s \u2013 dot t \u2013 dot u \u2013 dot v \u2013 4 w \u2013 2 x \u2013 6 y \u2013 4 z \u2013 OUT all capital letters \u2013 four if lower case is 0 or 1, six if lower case is worth any more runs all punctuation \u2013 extras (calculated by various means) This is predicated on test and county cricket, never tested on T20! These people are my people. I\u2019d like to think people play it using OBO entries too. 60 overs: Essex 118-4 (Westley 32, Ten Doeschate 0) A run! Westley pushes through the offside for a single off Leach, who offers a mid-range lbw appeal from the penultimate delivery after pushing one into Doeschate\u2019s pads. Not out. And that\u2019s tea. And it\u2019s the end of what earlier in a game would have been a properly gripping and absorbing session \u2013 some composed batting, some raging turn and a brief clatter of wickets. But it\u2019s all too late. 59 overs: Essex 117-4 (Westley 31, Ten Doeschate 0) Van der Merwe continues to the seasoned Ryan Ten Doeschate \u2013 there\u2019s such a fine blend of promise and experience in this Essex side \u2013 though he\u2019s done like a kipper from two that jag away, but it doesn\u2019t take the edge. Good, testing over from the spinner. And they\u2019re going to squeeze in another before tea. 58 overs: Essex 117-4 (Westley 31, Ten Doeschate 0) Seven round the bat now, but not much in front of Westley who bunts a low full toss past the vacant mid-on area for four. Two more follow as another similar delivery is flicked to midwicket. 57 overs: Essex 111-4 (Westley 25, Ten Doeschate 0) It\u2019s been all spin today, though the briefest gander at this Cyderabad surface makes that entirely understandable. As Van der Merwe demonstrates by dismissing Bopara \u2013 that\u2019s three wickets for nine. Just another 16 to go (including a brief thrash-batting interlude). Job\u2019s a good\u2019un. Another one down. Bopara pops one up to silly point, where Abell takes the catch. 56 overs: Essex 111-3 (Westley 25, Bopara 1) Nice from Westley, leaning forward and smothering the spin to push away on the legside for two. Wonder if he\u2019ll ever get an England chance again? There were technical flaws \u2013 playing to leg across the line \u2013 but technical strengths too, and he didn\u2019t look hopelessly out of his depth. 55 overs: Essex 109-3 (Westley 23, Bopara 1) Bopara does well to keep out a grubber from Van der Merwe but is otherwise untroubled in an eventless maiden. Going back to pencil cricket \u2013 and variants thereof \u2013 did anyone used to play \u2018book cricket\u2019, whereby you\u2019d allocate an outcome (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, caught, bowled, lbw, runout, stumped) to each letter in the alphabet and then compile innings based on painstakingly going through a book or newspaper? 54 overs: Essex 109-3 (Westley 23, Bopara 1) It\u2019s turning square at times here, which means Leach isn\u2019t finding an edge with some of his rippers, but Westley sees out the maiden under the attentions of six close fielders. 53 overs: Essex 109-3 (Westley 23, Bopara 1) Van der Merwe is giving the batsmen something to think about too, finding some extravagant turn against Bopara, though he\u2019s a seasoned campaigner, our Ravi, and does nowt rash. 52 overs: Essex 109-3 (Westley 23, Bopara 1) Leach rips another leg-break past Bopara\u2019s outside edge, before the new man gets off the mark with a single. It\u2019s a beautiful sunny day. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have been here for a fourth day with this surface if the weather had stayed good,\u201d says Dominic Cork in the commentary box. But then we\u2019d have a different type of surface if it was sun-baked. Though this is Taunton. 51overs: Essex 108-3 (Westley 23, Bopara 0) Ooh! For all that Somerset have been unlucky with decisions today, there\u2019s a suggestion that Overton might not have got his hands underneath that catch to dismiss Lawrence. Not easy to tell though. Six off this over, a two for Westley followed by a confident cover drive for four. 50 overs: Essex 102-3 (Westley 17) Two in the over for Leach! New man Dan Lawrence edges his second ball low to Overton at slip, and these are deserved scalps. 49.4 overs: Essex 102-2 (Westley 17) Leach has two slips, a silly point, a gully and a silly mid-off in for Westley, who still manages to squirt an edge past them for a single, bringing to the strike Cook, who brings up a fine 50 with a legside clip off a low full toss for four. The Essex fans in the crowd make themselves heard. Well played sir. And then next ball \u2013 he\u2019s gone, prodding off bat and pad to Tom Banton at silly mid-on 49th over: Essex 97-1 (Westley 16, Cook 49) Another over featuring one run to Cook, from Van der Merwe. Westley gets one too. \u201cI think Peter Salmon is onto a winner,\u201d says Kim Thonger of jazzing up our cricketing spin-off games. \u201cBut let\u2019s make it a bit livelier. I\u2019m thinking a cross between Its a Knockout, The Crystal Maze and Treasure Hunt. Anneka Rice could compere possibly with Henry Blofeld and Alan \u2018Chatty Man\u2019 Carr. I\u2019d do the whole thing on ice if I had artistic control. Ben Stokes in a skintight leotard doing a triple falco ought to set even the most elderly ECB overlord\u2019s pulse racing, hopefully creating a few vacancies on the steering committee.\u201d 48th over: Essex 95-1 (Westley 15, Cook 48) Leach continues, Cook continues to get \u2018em in ones, so he should have his 50 in Leach\u2019s next over. Then another big appeal, as a ripper from Leach jags from leg to off and beats Westley all ends up. No edge discerned by the umpire, replays suggest a possible glove/back-arm combo. Somerset have been unlucky today. Then an ultra-edge examination on Sky finds no nick and vindicates the umpire. 47th over: Essex 94-1 (Westley 15, Cook 47) Van der Merwe appeals for a feathered catch to the keeper down the legside against Cook, but the umpire rules that feather came there none. Somerset have a leg slip and a leg gully in for Cook but he managed to beat both to get a clipped single, 46th over: Essex 93-1 (Westley 15, Cook 46) Leech returns from the River End \u2013 he\u2019s bowled very well today \u2013 but Cook, the old master, is equal to it all. He adds another single, the only scoring stroke of the over. 45th over: Essex 92-1 (Westley 15, Cook 45) Thanks Tanya and greetings everyone, as Van der Merwe rattles through another over, yielding a solitary single.. There\u2019s no lack of focus out there, as Somerset continue to crowd round the bat while the Essex pair, it must be said, have shown application and skill in seeing this out. As they surely will now. Somerset need 19 wickets in the next three hours or so. 44th over: Essex 91-1 (Westley 15, Cook 44) Bess has been very busy today, bowling unchanged from the Ian Botham end. On he rolls, dangerous, but without luck. Four tasty byes trickle away. And that\u2019s it from me, as I hand over to Tom Davies. A wonderful season; thanks to you all for your messages and emails. It\u2019s been a lot of fun. 43rd over: Essex 82-1 (Westley 15, Cook 43) A drive, for four, off van der Merwe - then a huge lbw appeal, turned down. This is slipping away now. 42nd over: Essex 82-1 (Westley 11, Cook 43) Cook is beaten by Bess, and then rocks back and hits a boundary. Four byes runs away towards the shadows. 41st over: Essex 74-1 (Westley 11, Cook 39) Westley is surrounded by seven praying mantis. A maiden. Marcus Trescothick is on the radio, on the last day of his professional career after 27 years. \u201cI can\u2019t do like I used to. I have to put my glasses on for a start, it\u2019s not as easy as it used to be. Why would I want to go out there and struggle?\u201d I think they\u2019ll be back on again in a minute. This pencil cricket is really catching on. Peter Salmon ponders: \u201cWould Kim see the pencil cricket tournament featuring the actual players? Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler sat at a table with Pat Cummins would make for riveting pencil cricket, really get the kids involved.\u201d 4o.1 overs: Essex 74-1 (Westley 11, Cook 39) And Tom Westley has timely trouble with his pads. On come the water carriers, and the minutes tick by. Oh, here comes the rain again, though the sky is blue. The players are off, though probably not for long Brian Withington is having thoughts: \u201cIgnoring forfeits, I\u2019m wondering what the lowest third innings score before a declaration might be? And wouldn\u2019t it be nice if Somerset got the chance to break that record some time later today - daring Essex not to chase say 75 in 20 overs of flighted filth?\u201d Brian, someone on here will know that. 40th over: Essex 74-1 (Westley 11, Cook 39) No luck. \u201cAfternoon Tanya.\u201d Afternoon David! \u201cWill we see a white pencil cricket superseding a red pencil cricket?\u201d What a very good point. 39th over: Essex 74-1 (Westley 11, Cook 39) A ball from van der Merwe squeezes off Westley and between the slips. This isn\u2019t going to happen is it, whatever those there daemons. 38th over: Essex 69-1 (Westley 6, Cook 39) Bess continues but Westley and Cook survive, as the Somerset journalists break into \u201cGo Somerset\u201dto the tinny tune of a mobile phone. 37th over: Essex 66-1 (Westley 6, Cook 36) van der Merwe whizzes through another over as a replacement for Leach at the pavilion end. 36th over: Essex 62-1 (Westley 2, Cook 36) Cook gets frisky, chunking the ball through cover for four, cutting down to the pavilion boundary for another. A tasty lbw appeal in between from Bess. The Essex 12th man brings out some no doubt essential towels and water. Mes writes: \u201cTo take Kim\u2019s quite brilliant idea further, these pencil teams need proper franchise names - the \u2018Southern Shavings\u2019, the \u2018Birmingham Ballpoints\u2019, the \u2018Leeds Leads\u2019 (geddit?). Write-ups by journalists to be headed: \u201cMe and my pencil.\u201d These are more than shavings of an idea. 35th over: Essex 54-1 (Westley 2, Cook 28) Three byes as the ball spins past everyone, batman, keeper, fielders. And glory be, the follow on has been saved! Leach spins the ball hand to hand and, what\u2019s is this? We have shadows. 34th over: Essex 51-1 (Westley 2, Cook 26) Somerset have two appeals to the umpire off this Bess over, an lbw and a catch to the fielder at leg-slip that came off the pad. Hoods go up in the stands. The floodlights are on. 32nd over: Essex 50-1 (Westley 2, Cook 26) You could drive a miniature car under Westley\u2019s forward stretch. Another Leach maiden; yet still they come through the Taunton gates. 31st over: Essex 50-1 (Westley 2, Cook 26) One of the Overtons is down on his knees at second slip, back stretched out as if offering Cook a piggy-back ride. Five dots, then a shorter one, and Cook chops a shorter ball away for four. Classic Cook. Class. 30th over: Essex 46-1 (Westley 2, Cook 22) Rattled through, that over was. No wickets, no runs, on a dustbowl. As people seem so keen on pencil cricket I propose we replace the proposed Hundred tournament (circus) with a pencil based version of it, played over a late summer weekend, perhaps by \u2018celebrities\u2019, writes Kim Thonger. \u201cThis would free up July and August for proper County Championship cricket, and enable good young cricketers to get some actual red ball cricket in to develop their natural talents and hone their tactical and strategic thinking.\u201d You know, I think the ECB might go for that. 29th over: Essex 46-1 (Westley 2, Cook 22) Four close fielders surround Cook waiting, predatory, for that edge. But it doesn\u2019t come. Another maiden. Bess 10-4-12-1. 28th over: Essex 46-1 (Westley 1, Cook 21) Cook is batting in short sleeves; Westley in huge baggy jumper, bouncing, crouching stance. Leach wheels out another half dozen beautifully spinning deliveries, but Essex survive. 27th over: Essex 44-1 (Westley 1, Cook 21) A pleasingly-full Taunton watches Bess bowl another post-lunch over. Another maiden, but it\u2019s not enough. Abhijato Sensarma writes: \u201cWhat\u2019s stopping us from calling the duo of Bess and Leach ... \u2018Beach\u2019? Also, the surface of Ciderabad which they\u2019ve owned, could be called their \u2018Backyard Beach\u2019!\u201d Boom boom. 26th over: Essex 44-1 (Westley 1, Cook 21) Runs! A boundary, as Cook clips Leach through mid-wicket. But Leach wheels on as the seagulls float overhead. Then Westley is beaten by one that turns a reel; the over finishes with a forlorn shout for a catch behind. 26th over: Essex 39-1 (Westley 1, Cook 16) Cook pushes Bess through for a quick single and then Westley survives one that squeezes and bounces before a vocal lbw shout that was possibly a bit high. 25th over: Essex 38-1 (Westley 1, Cook 15) Leach fizzes in to Westley who does well to survive some almost unplayable balls, ripping through the dust. 24th over: Essex 38-1 (Westley 1, Cook 15) Not quite sure what happened there sorry I was eating lemon cheese cake with Vic and they started a little early. As the covers are pushed hurriedly back onto the pitch, and the brollies rise in unison in the stands. 23rd over: Essex 36-1 (Westley 0, Cook 14)The temporary cabin I\u2019m sitting in is being buffeted by the wind, so it must be blowy out in the middle. Vic joins me in a woolly hat and tells me that Cook was definitely lbw to Leach earlier. And the rain starts to fall. 22nd over: Essex 35-1 (Westley 0, Cook 12) A precious wicket with the last ball of Bess\u2019s over. Surely, surely, there is no time... Browne, prodding forward, is caught at silly point by a juggling Banton. Is this the beginning?! 21st over: Essex 34-0 (Browne 18, Cook 12) And another maiden from Leach. Testing times for Cook and Browne. 20th over: Essex 34-0 (Browne 18, Cook 12) Bess - a maiden. A couple of lovely notes about pencil/dice cricket. From Romeo: I used to play the same game with a pair of commercially produced metal hexagonal bars which I expect my grandfather (who first taught me cricket) gave us. It was called \u2018Howzat\u2019. After a while it became clear that it wasn\u2019t that representative of actual cricket as the probability of a six or a wicket or a whatever didn\u2019t match what I saw in International Cavaliers matches on BBC2 on Sundays. To remedy this, I then decided to cut out a circle of card, about four inches diameter (this is pre-decimal), and draw pie-chart sectors on it, a big one for a dot, a smaller one for a single, a much smaller one for a four and a tiny one for a six. I did the same with the \u2018how out\u2019 possibilities (in a different-coloured crayon). I then stuck a pin in the middle and then onto a board, spun the disc and as it fell against a mark on the board, played the game. I used to score the matches in a proper scorebook, with made-up teams of my favourite players, and would often play entire Test series (usually England against Rest of the World. I\u2019d do this throughout the summer when it was raining. If it wasn\u2019t, I\u2019d be in the garden being bowled or tonked by my elder brother.\u201d And from Peter Salmon: Nice to hear that Kim Thonger has got the pencils out. Great game, spent ours playing it in my exciting yoof. Quick question though, does he change the pencils depending on the format of the game? For 20/20 you only really need 1, 4, 4, 6, 6 and out. And is today the last time we\u2019ll watch Sir Al bat? I don\u2019t think so unless you know something that I don\u2019t... 19th over: Essex 34-0 (Browne 18, Cook 12) In front of me, the groundsmen are sitting by the wheel-on covers, just in case y\u2019all. Two dogs stare each other out to the side of the Ondaatje stand. Leach spins in, tossing the ball high, then low, with the men round the bat close enough to advise on necessary nasal hair removal. 18th over: Essex 34-0 (Browne 18, Cook 12) Young Dom Bess, who spent a fair chunk of his season at Headingley, gets to finish off the season bowling in the title decider at Taunton. Hope he stays. Grubby-knee-ed, he bowls with barely a pause. Cook, a master at this stuff, muffles and nudges. 17th over: Essex 32-0 (Browne 18, Cook 10) The skies are bordering on black. Leach appeals for LBW against Browne but the umpires remain uninterested. Somerset are whizzing through these overs. 16th over: Essex 32-0 (Browne 18, Cook 10) Brown uses the full length of his limbs to stretch forward to muffle Bess\u2019s spin. Just a single, but that matters not a bean. Somerset need 20 wickets. 15th over: Essex 31-0 (Browne 18, Cook 9) Leach, rubbing his left hand to keep feeling in those fingers, comes in off his seven-step run-up. Just one off the over. In the stands, fleeces are zipped to the chin. 14th over: Essex 30-0 (Browne 17, Cook 9) And so they try again. Dom Bess replaces Van der Merwe at the ITBotham stand. Bess, bowling in long sleeves, wheels in, lovely action. The pitch is an unpredictable as a yorkshire pudding. Cook sweeps for four. And that might well be that. It looked pretty tricky out there to bat, breadcrumbs for what might have been. David Lloyd writes: Tanya, answering you call for emails, much was made at the start of the season about the new Dukes ball and how batsmen would be dominant because it would do less than the old one, so much so that the old ball was pressed into use for the Ashes. In practice there have been lots of games where the ball has been in the ascendant (and not just those in which Worcs were playing...). Has there been any comment from coaches/teams about the ball over the season? Will the same ball be used next year? Thanks again for all your work over the summer. Makes keeping up with the CC so much fun. This is true David, and the issue seems to have been largely forgotten about since. Hang on a minute, the players are coming back out! And the players come off. 13th over: Essex 25-0 (Browne 16, Cook 5) And as Jack Leach takes the ball from the pavilion end, the floodlights come on. Alastair Cook goes back on his stumps and oooooh! a huge appeal for lbw to one that spun sharply, but the umpire is not impressed. And I\u2019m afraid the anoraks are coming on again. 12th over: Essex 25-0 (Browne 16, Cook 5) Just to confirm that they will be taking lunch at one. Left-armer van der Merwe takes the ball from the Sir Ian Botham Stand end, Browne prods forward, and forward again. A maiden. And thank you to Andrew Cosgrove for clearing up the boundary dispute: The change to the boundary law was relatively recent. It was not something that gradually changed, it will have been when the laws were revised in the last few years. The laws specifically used to say that if a fence or similar was used as the boundary marker, the ball had to clear the fence to be a six (striking the fence was a four), and that a fielder was permitted to lean on the fence in order to catch a ball landing beyond the fence. I have so far been unable to pinpoint when that revision to the laws were made, but I\u2019m pretty sure it was some time this century. He later pinpoints it: The change was made in the 2000 revision of the laws compare https://apps.lords.org/assets/Uploads/MCC-Laws-of-Cricket-2000-Code-6th-Edition-2016.pdf With http://static.espncricinfo.com/db/ABOUT_CRICKET/LAWS/1980_CODE/LAW_19_BOUNDARIES.html 19.3 (c) A Fieldsman with ball in hand grounds any part of his person over a boundary fence or board. This allows the Fieldsman to touch or lean on or over a boundary fence or board in preventing a boundary. Whereas in the updated law, 19.2 (c) (ii) For a fence, which includes any similar object in contact with the ground but with a flat surface projecting above the ground, the boundary edge will be the base line of the fence. We\u2019re about to start here at Taunton, though the sky is looking rather ominous to the south-west. This is rather lovely. If there is no more rain... In defiance of the rain, Kim Thonger is deciding the Championship with his pencil case. \u201cAs my hopes of glory fade in the rain clouds I\u2019m distracting myself by playing Somerset v Essex using two hexagonal pencils. I haven\u2019t done this since childhood in the late 60s but it seems a reasonable way to decide the Championship. \u201cFor those unfamiliar with the game, you simply mark each side of the first pencil with 1,2,3,4,6,Out \u201cThen roll it. \u201cThe second pencil, marked with four methods of dismissal, B, C, RUN OUT, or LBW comes into play when the first pencil is rolled and ends with the Out side uppermost. The other two sides on the second pencil are NO BALL and WIDE \u201cThese days I suppose a third pencil could be added to decide the outcome of reviews using DRS \u201cA rudimentary scorecard is required. The back page of an arithmetic exercise book always worked well. \u201cSomerset are currently romping to what looks like an innings victory. This is obviously what would have happened had the weather gods not frowned upon us.\u201d \u201cThanks for the coverage this season and thanks for the link to the story about the 1984 season\u201d writes Nick Butler. [It\u2019s a pleasure!] \u201cAs a Notts fan I might be biased but watching the video in the article it\u2019s incredible that the catch up against the hoardings (Hadlee caught out) was given out with the fielder leaning on the hoardings as he takes it - and also amazing that the hoardings were the boundary apparently.\u201d It is! I\u2019ve asked around the press box and no-one can remember when that changed, when the hoardings became disqualifiers. One of those things that just slowly segued perhaps? There is no play yet today. Anywhere. Do send me an email or two. Some succour for the south west. This is a timely, and super read, by Steve Pye. A note, from Sam Aldred in Auckland: \u201cThe Taunton all rounders competition must feel like a long time ago.\u201d [NB very funny but where\u2019s my birthday card? It was \u2018in the post\u2019 in February] Hampshire twist the knife, announcing a new three-year contract with their dream-crusher Kyle Abbott. \u201cI can\u2019t speak highly enough of Kyle,\u201d said Hampshire\u2019s director of cricket Giles White. \u201cHe has once again shown what a valuable asset he is to the team. He continually puts in match-winning contributions; he is a great role model for the younger players and he shows a great passion for playing for the club. For all these reasons we are delighted he will be with us for the long-term.\u201d Abbot has pocketed more than 50 Championship wickets in each of the last three years. In the last round his 17-86 destroyed Somerset and left them with a tricky 12 point deficit going into this round, which then became impossible to overhaul due to rain. . And so it ends. There will be no play before lunch at Edgbaston, there will be an inspection at 10.30 at Grace Road, it is raining at Lord\u2019s and is damp at The Oval. No news yet from Hove. And, just in, a further inspection at 11.30 here at Taunton. But here are the nominations for the PCA young players of the year.. Here\u2019s to a happy man in his office. Time for doughnuts all round Steve? They\u2019ve called it a day at Canterbury for Kent v Hampshire, at Bristol, now both sides are safely promoted, as well as at The Riverside. And here at Taunton, the cover are back on again. With the match at The Riverside between Glamorgan and Durham being abandoned after heavy overnight rain, Gloucestershire and Northamptonshire will join Lancashire in Division One next year. Congratulations! After toast and coffee at the Bakery at Riverside Coffee Shop (highly recommended), I\u2019m back at the ground where Somerset are playing football with a linesman in full kit. But I\u2019m afraid to say the sky is now looking very grey. Hey-ho, but this is a lovely interview, with Darren Stevens. Round the grounds, Northants and Gloucestershire are nearly guaranteed Division One cricket next season, as chasers Glamorgan\u2019s game against Durham has failed to get more than a few steps off the starting blocks. As well as players examining their palms at Taunton, there was no play at all yesterday at Canterbury, Edgbaston, The Riverside or Hove. Ollie Pope scored a wonderful hundred for Surrey against Notts, backed up by a more reserved effort by Scott Borthwick; Ben Charlesworth and Graeme van Buuren advanced the score for Gloucestershire; Lancashire were bowled out for 170 in a vain-glorious attempt to lose their first match of the season against wooden-spoonists Leicestershire; and Harvey Hosein and Leus du Plooy both scored fifties for Derby. on this, the last day of the 2019 county season. Taunton has pulled up her socks and is looking glorious for the occasion, with blue skies and people tripping coatless across the light turquoise wrought iron bridge over the river on their way to the ground. The yew trees in St James\u2019 churchyard stand majestic, but the last summer fuchsias are moulding, the buddleia are leggy and autumn leaves have blown against the walls of the church. It is time. First things first, it isn\u2019t raining, but it did, heavily, during the night. The groundstaff are busy, zipping about on their incredible machines, but the outfield is damp - yesterday so damp that water was coming up through the surface on the pavilion side of the ground Hopes of Somerset winning the first Championship in their history had all but drained away with yesterday\u2019s washout. But one man still believes, Andy Hurry, Somerset\u2019s director of cricket, whose optimism produced one of the stranger press conferences of the season last night. \u201cOur challenge has become stiffer, but having displayed courage, conviction and belief all season, we are not going to lose it overnight.We have put too much on the line for too long to wave the white flag. That\u2019s not what we are about. Tomorrow is about giving 100 per cent and, whatever happens, putting down a marker for next year.\u201d \u201cI have total belief in our players and staff. This summer there has been some amazing cricket, with huge twists and turns. Anything can happen and we have to keep believing.\u201d So there you go - can there possibly be one final twist in this crazy-love summer?",

You can get pulled in lots of directions otherwise, and have no voice \u2013 and that\u2019s death for an artist.\u201d Chances are, even if others tried to pull her to and fro, Llewellyn would land on her feet. The stage is her home. Listen to Elizabeth Llewellyn live as she joins three other stunning soloists and conductor Richard Farnes for Beethoven\u2019s Missa solemnis",

      "body": "<p>Despite the best efforts of orchestras and opera companies to attract a new and younger audience, some classical music myths still abound. Somehow, there persists an idea that classical concerts are very formal events in which people in tuxedos and ballgowns buy very expensive tickets to hear ancient, irrelevant music, performed by ageing men dressed like they are from the 19th century. And, even if you did manage to pass the classical music quiz to get in, they would soon spot your inappropriate behaviour and, not being an expert, you would have no idea what is going on, right? Wrong. None of that is true, of course.</p> <p><strong>Trainers allowed<br></strong>Modern audiences come in all shapes and sizes, and are as likely to be dressed in a T-shirt and jeans as in a suit and tie. What\u2019s more, compared with other forms of entertainment, prices are very reasonable. Tickets for the BBC Symphony Orchestra at the Barbican in London, for instance, start at \u00a312, or less if you take advantage of a young person\u2019s scheme \u2013 certainly cheaper than a football match or the cinema in London, and not much to witness 90 professional musicians playing some of the world\u2019s greatest music.</p> <p><strong>Enjoy in unexpected places<br></strong>Most performances take place in concert halls, but classical music is very diverse \u2013 some concerts will feature a full symphony orchestra, others just a choir, a string quartet or even a solo pianist. Pieces for these smaller ensembles are called chamber music and are often presented in more intimate spaces, but over the past 10 years or so there has been a movement to present classical music outside of traditional venues altogether. The Multi-Story Orchestra, for instance, consists of young professional musicians playing a classical summer series at a multi-storey car park in London\u2019s Peckham. Then there is Nonclassical, founded by classical composer and dance, grime, electro and hip-hop producer Gabriel Prokofiev, which puts on regular classical music gigs in pubs.</p> <p><strong>Silence is not always golden<br></strong>When it comes to concert etiquette, most concert halls \u2013 like most theatres \u2013 expect a degree of quiet attention from the audience. However, some organisations, such as BBC National Orchestra of Wales offer no-rules concerts. In its Classical Playlist: Live, audience members are encouraged to walk around, have a drink, keep their phones on and even take photos (<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/events/epxp8g\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brangwyn Hall, Swansea, 5 October 2019</a>). English National Opera (the London-based company that performs all its repertoire in English) is offering a relaxed performance of Gilbert and Sullivan\u2019s comedy The Mikado, to encourage autistic adults and children to attend, inviting them to make noise if they like, while dimming the lights and removing any loud noises (<a href=\"https://www.eno.org/whats-on/the-mikado/\" rel=\"nofollow\">23 November 2019</a>).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4187f6126769b5fa72e380f1f2c27846a00812d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4187f6126769b5fa72e380f1f2c27846a00812d0/0_128_1920_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"SUPPORTING Dalia Stasevska (BBC SO Classical for Starters and New Music)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dalia Stasevska, who will be conducting the BBC Symphony Orchestra as part of the Classical for Starters series.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Christodoulou</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Beginners welcome<br></strong>As for not knowing what\u2019s going on, all concerts provide a programme to read, explaining the background to the music you are hearing, and these are often free. The BBC even has a Discover New Music series, which includes its day-long Total Immersion events. (On <a href=\"https://www.barbican.org.uk/whats-on/2019/event/bbc-so-total-immersion-detlev-glanert-film-screening\" rel=\"nofollow\">7 December 2019 at the Barbican, London</a>, German composer Detlev Glanert\u2019s work will be explored through film, interview and concerts with the BBC Singers and BBC Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.) Meanwhile, there\u2019s also a series entitled Classical for Starters \u2013 the BBC Concert Orchestra\u2019s recent Orchestra Unwrapped saw Alice Farnham conducting pieces by Mozart and Stravinsky, alongside well-known film music by John Williams. A month later, Dalia Stasevska conducts the BBC Symphony Orchestra in Rachmaninov\u2019s sprightly Symphonic Dances (<a href=\"https://www.barbican.org.uk/whats-on/2019/event/bbc-symphony-orchestrastasevska\" rel=\"nofollow\">26 October 2019, Barbican, London</a>). You may have noted that the conductors just mentioned are both women \u2013 the days of exclusively male orchestras conducted by old men are long gone. Indeed, BBC Symphony Orchestra has just appointed young British conductor Jules Buckley as its new creative artist in association. Buckley says he is eager \u201cto innovate and challenge the stereotypes of what orchestral music should be\u201d. His first concert with the orchestra will be at the <a href=\"https://www.barbican.org.uk/whats-on/2020/event/bbc-symphony-orchestra-lianne-la-havas\" rel=\"nofollow\">Barbican, London, on Friday 28 February 2020</a> and features soul singer Lianne La Havas. Previously, Buckley has joined in the BBC Proms concerts at the Royal Albert Hall with diverse programmes such as this year\u2019s The Breaks, exploring the world of scratch DJs, hip-hop and breakdancing (6 September 2019).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sounds-of-our-lives/2019/sep/23/five-ways-to-get-your-family-into-classical-music\">Five ways to get your family into classical music</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>A millennium of variety<br></strong>Finally, the assumption that classical music all sounds the same is clearly erroneous, given that it stretches back nearly a thousand years. From choirs singing mediaeval vocal polyphony, Tudor viol consorts, to songs for piano and voice, and vast modern-day orchestras, the scale and variety of music is incomparable. So while the incredible works of Mozart, Beethoven and Brahms will always have a place on the concert platform, there are plenty of pieces by modern, living composers too. Anna Meredith\u2019s music, for example, embraces both electronica and traditional instruments \u2013 she has even written a Concerto for Orchestra and Beatboxer. Then there\u2019s David Lang, whose fresh take on Beethoven\u2019s Fidelio, Prisoner of the State, is a stripped-down opera with the orchestra on stage (<a href=\"https://www.barbican.org.uk/whats-on/2020/event/bbc-symphony-orchestra-david-langs-prisoner-of-the-state\" rel=\"nofollow\">11 January, Barbican</a>). Spanning everything from medieval polyphony to beatboxing, there is no one single thing that is classical music \u2013 and the same is true for its audiences. All you have to do is turn up, buy a ticket and enjoy.</p> <p><em>Start your classical music journey with concerts from the BBC\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/classicalforstarters\" rel=\"nofollow\">Classical for Starters</a> series</em></p>",

Somehow, there persists an idea that classical concerts are very formal events in which people in tuxedos and ballgowns buy very expensive tickets to hear ancient, irrelevant music, performed by ageing men dressed like they are from the 19th century. And, even if you did manage to pass the classical music quiz to get in, they would soon spot your inappropriate behaviour and, not being an expert, you would have no idea what is going on, right? Wrong. None of that is true, of course. Trainers allowed Modern audiences come in all shapes and sizes, and are as likely to be dressed in a T-shirt and jeans as in a suit and tie. What\u2019s more, compared with other forms of entertainment, prices are very reasonable. Tickets for the BBC Symphony Orchestra at the Barbican in London, for instance, start at \u00a312, or less if you take advantage of a young person\u2019s scheme \u2013 certainly cheaper than a football match or the cinema in London, and not much to witness 90 professional musicians playing some of the world\u2019s greatest music. Enjoy in unexpected places Most performances take place in concert halls, but classical music is very diverse \u2013 some concerts will feature a full symphony orchestra, others just a choir, a string quartet or even a solo pianist. Pieces for these smaller ensembles are called chamber music and are often presented in more intimate spaces, but over the past 10 years or so there has been a movement to present classical music outside of traditional venues altogether. The Multi-Story Orchestra, for instance, consists of young professional musicians playing a classical summer series at a multi-storey car park in London\u2019s Peckham. Then there is Nonclassical, founded by classical composer and dance, grime, electro and hip-hop producer Gabriel Prokofiev, which puts on regular classical music gigs in pubs. Silence is not always golden When it comes to concert etiquette, most concert halls \u2013 like most theatres \u2013 expect a degree of quiet attention from the audience. However, some organisations, such as BBC National Orchestra of Wales offer no-rules concerts. In its Classical Playlist: Live, audience members are encouraged to walk around, have a drink, keep their phones on and even take photos (Brangwyn Hall, Swansea, 5 October 2019). English National Opera (the London-based company that performs all its repertoire in English) is offering a relaxed performance of Gilbert and Sullivan\u2019s comedy The Mikado, to encourage autistic adults and children to attend, inviting them to make noise if they like, while dimming the lights and removing any loud noises (23 November 2019). Beginners welcome As for not knowing what\u2019s going on, all concerts provide a programme to read, explaining the background to the music you are hearing, and these are often free. The BBC even has a Discover New Music series, which includes its day-long Total Immersion events. (On 7 December 2019 at the Barbican, London, German composer Detlev Glanert\u2019s work will be explored through film, interview and concerts with the BBC Singers and BBC Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.) Meanwhile, there\u2019s also a series entitled Classical for Starters \u2013 the BBC Concert Orchestra\u2019s recent Orchestra Unwrapped saw Alice Farnham conducting pieces by Mozart and Stravinsky, alongside well-known film music by John Williams. A month later, Dalia Stasevska conducts the BBC Symphony Orchestra in Rachmaninov\u2019s sprightly Symphonic Dances (26 October 2019, Barbican, London). You may have noted that the conductors just mentioned are both women \u2013 the days of exclusively male orchestras conducted by old men are long gone. Indeed, BBC Symphony Orchestra has just appointed young British conductor Jules Buckley as its new creative artist in association. Buckley says he is eager \u201cto innovate and challenge the stereotypes of what orchestral music should be\u201d. His first concert with the orchestra will be at the Barbican, London, on Friday 28 February 2020 and features soul singer Lianne La Havas. Previously, Buckley has joined in the BBC Proms concerts at the Royal Albert Hall with diverse programmes such as this year\u2019s The Breaks, exploring the world of scratch DJs, hip-hop and breakdancing (6 September 2019). A millennium of variety Finally, the assumption that classical music all sounds the same is clearly erroneous, given that it stretches back nearly a thousand years. From choirs singing mediaeval vocal polyphony, Tudor viol consorts, to songs for piano and voice, and vast modern-day orchestras, the scale and variety of music is incomparable. So while the incredible works of Mozart, Beethoven and Brahms will always have a place on the concert platform, there are plenty of pieces by modern, living composers too. Anna Meredith\u2019s music, for example, embraces both electronica and traditional instruments \u2013 she has even written a Concerto for Orchestra and Beatboxer. Then there\u2019s David Lang, whose fresh take on Beethoven\u2019s Fidelio, Prisoner of the State, is a stripped-down opera with the orchestra on stage (11 January, Barbican). Spanning everything from medieval polyphony to beatboxing, there is no one single thing that is classical music \u2013 and the same is true for its audiences. All you have to do is turn up, buy a ticket and enjoy. Start your classical music journey with concerts from the BBC\u2019s Classical for Starters series",

As you may have noticed, it is impossible for a journalist to appear on screen, ever, without hundreds of real-life journalists taking to social media to point out minuscule inaccuracies in how they are being depicted. Even if the show in question is a comedy, there really is no greater comedy than this: some hack who has just come off the wrong side of a \u00a3250,000 legal bill for claiming a former Hollyoaks star shags donkeys or whatever explaining why, actually, that specific level of reporter just wouldn\u2019t be at morning editorial conference, or why that fictional headline layout doesn\u2019t fit the page properly. These monstrous and heartless inaccuracies must end.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Apparently Bodyguard drove everyone at the Met 'absolutely up the wall'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As a journalist myself, I am too caught up in this faultless industry to feel anything other than inchoate outrage at the fact I have just watched a telly show in which a certain type of political story makes the splash when it would probably only get the page 3 lead. Ghastly beyond words. But you, as civilians, must really feel the pain even more. It must be absolutely maddening to watch Her Majesty\u2019s press traduced in these infinitesimal ways, with such presumably immense consequences for something or other, and only 1,547 of them online, as it\u2019s being broadcast, to rage about it. Do weep for the plight of the journalist who KNOWS that real newsdesks have MUCH more paper piled on them than that, but somehow has to watch a marginally unrealistic version happen on ITV1, slightly pissed, and with no means of correcting the grotesque error with similar prominence. I mean, you\u2019re fighting a behemoth. They\u2019re not going to give you a six-part drama where you can redress the wrong, are they? The damage is done.</p> <p>But you know, could they? Could they actually give you a six-part drama? Do telly bosses have the balls? is the question. Because you have a brilliant idea for a screenplay about a journalist not entirely based on you, and you are in fact open to writing it for TV, in this golden age of the medium. You know, in January, when you\u2019re not drinking. Can\u2019t be that hard, can it, considering there are about as many words in 15 minutes of telly as there are in your most recent newspaper feature, Man City Stars and Their Cars. They could do so, so much worse than commission your drama instead of all the shit they have on instead. What\u2019s that? Write a treatment? No, I mean, you\u2019ve already got a recognised byline, haven\u2019t you? You can\u2019t be doing with all that fuss. You\u2019re more used to the proper way: pitching a two-line angle and getting out of the office for the day to see if it stacks up. But you will divulge to the TV network that it\u2019s like an actual cinema verite look at this endlessly fascinating news-based world. Like that one where Gerard Butler plays the world\u2019s leading meteorologist \u2013 but with newspapers. And with heart. Can you have eleventy hundred thousand pounds development money please.</p> <p>Anyway: Cressida Dick. The Met chief is now Dame Dick, thanks to Theresa May\u2019s resignation honours list. At work, I\u2019m not sure whether she is formally ma\u2019am or guv \u2013 I only know this stuff off the telly \u2013 but Ma\u2019amguv is very cross about how the police have been depicted on Line of Duty and Bodyguard. Both shows are, of course, ratings smashes, created by the highly acclaimed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/jed-mercurio\" title=\"\">Jed Mercurio</a>.</p> <p>Over to highly ennobled Cressida\u2019s Radio Times interview for more. First of all, let me say I\u2019m very glad she\u2019s done the chat. The best response to that tired old question: \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you out catching criminals?\u201d is: \u201cBecause I\u2019m giving an interview to the Radio Times.\u201d It seems the Met commissioner decided to sample Line of Duty after sitting next to one of its stars, Vicky McClure, at a dinner. Did she love it, and have a series of insidery theories as to who H was? \u201cI was absolutely outraged by the level of casual and extreme corruption that was being portrayed as the way the police is in 2018-19,\u201d explains Cressida. \u201cIt\u2019s so far from that. The standards and professionalism are so high.\u201d</p> <p>I know the temptation is to ask: are you the same Cressida Dick who was the senior officer in charge of the botched operation that killed Jean Charles de Menezes, which saw an innocent man shot on his way to work by police marksmen, and in the wake of which found the Met briefing all sorts of lies, such as the fact he\u2019d vaulted the ticket barrier and so on, to deflect from their catastrophic failings? But you can\u2019t ask that, because that\u2019s not in the spirit of a Radio Times interview.</p> <p>Alas, I am shocked to see that Mercurio doesn\u2019t understand the dramatic licence that should be afforded to appearances by police chiefs in the Radio Times, and has consequently decided to respond to Ma\u2019amguv\u2019s comments online. \u201cMy inspiration for creating Line of Duty was @metpoliceuk shooting an innocent man and their dishonesty in the aftermath,\u201d Jed states crisply, \u201cso thanks to Cressida Dick for reminding me of our connection.\u201d</p> <p>But there is more, because it turns out our top copper is also furious about Jed\u2019s show Bodyguard, staring Keeley Hawes and Richard Madden, which went out last year and was the BBC\u2019s most-watched drama in a decade. Apparently it drove everyone at the Met \u201cabsolutely up the wall\u201d. \u201cI actually did have to switch it off after about 20 minutes,\u201d the Met Chief tells the Radio Times, having made very similar comments to Good Morning Britain last year. \u201cThe moment when the home secretary [Hawes] made a pass at the protection officer was just beyond me, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d she says. I am sorry to hear that. A mindset where it is impossible to think oneself into the position where two extremely hot people on a screen might get it on, to the delight of the viewer, does rather close one off to about 70% of the popular dramatic canon.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/24/met-chief-cressida-dick-outraged-line-of-duty-corruption-portrayal\">Met chief 'outraged' at Line of Duty over corruption portrayal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Still, in his attempts to address her critique, Mercurio is also good enough to post a Private Eye cutting referencing Dame Dick\u2019s earlier GMB comments. On that occasion, she had sniffed of the Bodyguard romance: \u201cThis is ridiculous. I have a lot of personal protection officers, and I\u2019ve got to look after them.\u201d Private Eye reminds us that one such officer who Cressida Dick was specifically in charge of, as head of the specials operations directorate at the time, was the PPO who was dismissed from his job for allegedly starting an affair with the wife of the then-home secretary, Alan Johnson. \u201cAnd here\u2019s the inspiration for one story element in Bodyguard,\u201d notes Mercurio.</p> <p>Ah. How to smooth over this rather one-sided row (even though I\u2019d be happy for it to break out entertainingly again with each new series)? I wouldn\u2019t have the questing heart, and pockets, of a journalist if I didn\u2019t ask: is there any way Cressida could get, like, a story consultant credit on the shows? Doesn\u2019t have to be separate title card, on both. But at least one. And a seat and a plus-one for the Baftas. In return, perhaps the Met chief could push for what the people really deserve: a landmark public inquiry into TV misrepresentations of Britain\u2019s most beloved professions.</p>",

The standards and professionalism are so high.\u201d I know the temptation is to ask: are you the same Cressida Dick who was the senior officer in charge of the botched operation that killed Jean Charles de Menezes, which saw an innocent man shot on his way to work by police marksmen, and in the wake of which found the Met briefing all sorts of lies, such as the fact he\u2019d vaulted the ticket barrier and so on, to deflect from their catastrophic failings? But you can\u2019t ask that, because that\u2019s not in the spirit of a Radio Times interview. Alas, I am shocked to see that Mercurio doesn\u2019t understand the dramatic licence that should be afforded to appearances by police chiefs in the Radio Times, and has consequently decided to respond to Ma\u2019amguv\u2019s comments online. \u201cMy inspiration for creating Line of Duty was @metpoliceuk shooting an innocent man and their dishonesty in the aftermath,\u201d Jed states crisply, \u201cso thanks to Cressida Dick for reminding me of our connection.\u201d But there is more, because it turns out our top copper is also furious about Jed\u2019s show Bodyguard, staring Keeley Hawes and Richard Madden, which went out last year and was the BBC\u2019s most-watched drama in a decade. Apparently it drove everyone at the Met \u201cabsolutely up the wall\u201d. \u201cI actually did have to switch it off after about 20 minutes,\u201d the Met Chief tells the Radio Times, having made very similar comments to Good Morning Britain last year. \u201cThe moment when the home secretary [Hawes] made a pass at the protection officer was just beyond me, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d she says. I am sorry to hear that. A mindset where it is impossible to think oneself into the position where two extremely hot people on a screen might get it on, to the delight of the viewer, does rather close one off to about 70% of the popular dramatic canon. Still, in his attempts to address her critique, Mercurio is also good enough to post a Private Eye cutting referencing Dame Dick\u2019s earlier GMB comments. On that occasion, she had sniffed of the Bodyguard romance: \u201cThis is ridiculous. I have a lot of personal protection officers, and I\u2019ve got to look after them.\u201d Private Eye reminds us that one such officer who Cressida Dick was specifically in charge of, as head of the specials operations directorate at the time, was the PPO who was dismissed from his job for allegedly starting an affair with the wife of the then-home secretary, Alan Johnson. \u201cAnd here\u2019s the inspiration for one story element in Bodyguard,\u201d notes Mercurio. Ah. How to smooth over this rather one-sided row (even though I\u2019d be happy for it to break out entertainingly again with each new series)? I wouldn\u2019t have the questing heart, and pockets, of a journalist if I didn\u2019t ask: is there any way Cressida could get, like, a story consultant credit on the shows? Doesn\u2019t have to be separate title card, on both. But at least one. And a seat and a plus-one for the Baftas. In return, perhaps the Met chief could push for what the people really deserve: a landmark public inquiry into TV misrepresentations of Britain\u2019s most beloved professions.",

      "bodyText": "A company that rents digital message boards to schools said it has removed a series of slides featuring Boris Johnson after complaints from parents. The slides, showing a brief biography of Johnson \u2013 including one stating \u201cHe wants to unite the UK\u201d \u2013 were raised in the House of Commons by Stella Creasy, the Labour MP for Walthamstow, in north-east London, after parents in her constituency complained on social media about seeing the images at a local primary school. Phil Austin, the chief executive of Anomaly, the company that rents the 2 metre high displays to schools in England and Wales, said the slides were uploaded at the start of the month. \u201cWe\u2019re operating in thousands of schools and we\u2019ve never had a complaint about content until today,\u201d said Austin, who added the slides had now been deleted. The displays allow schools to broadcast their own announcements and videos for pupils and parents, while the company provides general interest content, such as informational videos on yoga, mental health and chickenpox. The cause of the controversy were three slides, out of nine, featuring Johnson, which Austin estimated would have appeared on screen for only 15 seconds. One slide reads: \u201cHe has made promises about public services\u201d and: \u201cHe has promised to put more money into schools, more money into the NHS and 20,000 police officers back on the streets.\u201d Another slide says: \u201cHe wants to unite the UK\u201d with a union jack in the background. A third shows a picture of MPs in the House of Commons debating chamber, with the caption: \u201cBrexit was supposed to happen on 29th March 2019 but politicians have been unable to agree a deal on the best way to do it\u201d and: \u201cHe [Johnson] promised Brexit would be done.\u201d Austin said the series also included a slide showing anti-Brexit protests which stated that \u201cnot everybody\u201d agrees with Johnson. Another slide showed Johnson when he was famously stuck on a zip wire, captioned: \u201cPeople have many different views about Boris Johnson because of his political views, plans for Brexit, personality, dress sense and past behaviour.\u201d Austin said the series also showed other prime ministers, including John Major. Austin said his company had been inundated with media inquiries since the images appeared on social media, and he apologised for causing distress. \u201cI\u2019d like to say that describing the prime minister as not popular with everybody, with anti-Brexit protests in the background, is not pro-Brexit,\u201d said Austin, who said he had \u201cno interest\u201d in politics and did not vote in the 2016 referendum. On Wednesday evening, after the Commons reconvened following the supreme court decision that prorogation was unlawful, Creasy asked Johnson: \u201cGiven the amount of money this government is spending on Brexit adverts, can he at least reassure Walthamstow residents that in this instance it wasn\u2019t his doing? And give his personal pledge that our primary schools will remain Brexit propaganda-free zones?\u201d Johnson replied: \u201cObviously the honourable lady is bringing me news about the schools in her constituency.\u201d Anomaly\u2019s websites said the displays had been \u201cinstrumental in helping schools improve their Ofsted grading\u201d. The company lists their benefits as \u201cengaging pupils to understand fundamental British values\u201d and \u201csafeguarding children from extremism and radicalisation\u201d, two areas under scrutiny by Ofsted and the Department for Education in England. Austin said the service in schools did not show adverts or use paid content. The government said it had no involvement with the slides.",

      "body": "<p>The rhetoric of change is everywhere right now, from self-improvement posts on Instagram to the brand-purpose campaigns that remain adland\u2019s biggest trend. While businesses are looking to create their own changemaker strategies, charities and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) are carrying on with their day jobs. For them, social innovation is an everyday business. So learning from NGOs is a great start for for-profit organisations looking to make a difference.</p> <p>Consider the wide-reaching activities of <a href=\"https://www.actionagainsthunger.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Action Against Hunger</a>, an NGO committed to saving children\u2019s lives across almost 50 countries. \u201cCritical to this mission is creating change,\u201d says Matthew White, director of fundraising and communications. \u201cChanging government policies, changing attitudes towards nutrition and, crucially, changing the prospects of the millions of children facing life-threatening hunger.\u201d</p> <p>If you think that sounds like a huge task, you\u2019d be right \u2013 but the steps to get there don\u2019t have to be. White explains: \u201cIt is easy to look at the scale of the challenge we face and think that it is insurmountable. We want to challenge that.\u201d He cites its annual <a href=\"https://www.actionagainsthunger.org.uk/lovefoodgivefood/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Love Food Give Food</a> campaign, in which restaurants across the UK add an optional \u00a31 donation to your bill during autumn. Although that\u2019s a small amount for most of us, this sum can provide a malnourished child with a day\u2019s worth of life-saving food. \u201cA pound isn\u2019t a massive amount of money, but they quickly add up,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b7d48378eb11a3537af9a31a0e77e704a5af899e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7d48378eb11a3537af9a31a0e77e704a5af899e/0_0_2362_3543/667.jpg\" alt=\"Action Against Hunger\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Action Against Hunger\u2019s Love Food Give Food campaign sees restaurants add an optional \u00a31 to bills: \u2018A pound isn\u2019t a massive amount of money, but they quickly add up.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Based in London, with a second site recently opened in Birmingham, <a href=\"https://thebikeproject.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Bike Project</a> also transforms lives through a seemingly small change: the chance to own a bike. The charity takes abandoned or donated bicycles, reconditions them and gives them to refugees and asylum seekers in the UK. \u201cWe believe no-one seeking asylum in the UK should be forced to choose between taking the bus and their next hot meal,\u201d says national operations manager Nicola Hill.</p> <p>Currently, most asylum seekers receive just <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/asylum-support/what-youll-get\" rel=\"nofollow\">\u00a337.75</a> to live on each week. \u201cWhen a weekly bus pass can cost \u00a321, this leaves many people destitute and socially isolated, unable to access vital services or the many opportunities that the UK has to offer in order to start rebuilding their lives,\u201d says Hill.

      "bodyText": "The rhetoric of change is everywhere right now, from self-improvement posts on Instagram to the brand-purpose campaigns that remain adland\u2019s biggest trend. While businesses are looking to create their own changemaker strategies, charities and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) are carrying on with their day jobs. For them, social innovation is an everyday business. So learning from NGOs is a great start for for-profit organisations looking to make a difference. Consider the wide-reaching activities of Action Against Hunger, an NGO committed to saving children\u2019s lives across almost 50 countries. \u201cCritical to this mission is creating change,\u201d says Matthew White, director of fundraising and communications. \u201cChanging government policies, changing attitudes towards nutrition and, crucially, changing the prospects of the millions of children facing life-threatening hunger.\u201d If you think that sounds like a huge task, you\u2019d be right \u2013 but the steps to get there don\u2019t have to be. White explains: \u201cIt is easy to look at the scale of the challenge we face and think that it is insurmountable. We want to challenge that.\u201d He cites its annual Love Food Give Food campaign, in which restaurants across the UK add an optional \u00a31 donation to your bill during autumn. Although that\u2019s a small amount for most of us, this sum can provide a malnourished child with a day\u2019s worth of life-saving food. \u201cA pound isn\u2019t a massive amount of money, but they quickly add up,\u201d he says. Based in London, with a second site recently opened in Birmingham, the Bike Project also transforms lives through a seemingly small change: the chance to own a bike. The charity takes abandoned or donated bicycles, reconditions them and gives them to refugees and asylum seekers in the UK. \u201cWe believe no-one seeking asylum in the UK should be forced to choose between taking the bus and their next hot meal,\u201d says national operations manager Nicola Hill. Currently, most asylum seekers receive just \u00a337.75 to live on each week. \u201cWhen a weekly bus pass can cost \u00a321, this leaves many people destitute and socially isolated, unable to access vital services or the many opportunities that the UK has to offer in order to start rebuilding their lives,\u201d says Hill. That\u2019s where the bikes come in. \u201cWe take an unwanted item, in the form of a bike, and use it to achieve social change. Over the past six years we\u2019ve been pioneering in what we do, striving to deepen our impact with the refugees we support.\u201d As well as giving recipients the confidence and skills they need to start cycling, the charity also sells good-as-new bikes to support its work. Whether these organisations are donating their 5,000th bike or persuading more than 500,000 diners to part with that all-important pound, both are milestone-driven \u2013 and success wouldn\u2019t be possible without their teams. So, how does everybody stay on track? \u201cWe have a clear purpose and strong brand values which all our staff rally behind,\u201d says White at Action Against Hunger, while Hill says: \u201cOur mission is very clear \u2013 there\u2019s no ambiguity about what we\u2019re all striving to achieve on a daily basis.\u201d A solid core means their influence can radiate out and inspire new changemakers, from Action Against Hunger\u2019s Michelin-starred chefs to the Bike Project\u2019s cyclists and upcyclers. \u201cWe harness support from the cycling community, people who want to show solidarity with refugees and those who don\u2019t want to see a perfectly good item (in this case, a bike) go to waste,\u201d says Hill. \u201cWe never stop learning and are conscious that we\u2019re only just scratching the surface of what we and our supporters can collectively achieve.\u201d Both charities nurture collaboration internally and externally, keeping ideas fresh and horizons broad. \u201cThere are an estimated 160,000 refugees and asylum seekers in the UK, and so we are acutely aware that there is so much more to be done,\u201d says Hill, whose sights are set on expansion across the UK.

      "body": "<h2>England</h2> <p><strong>Elliot Daly </strong>Untested in defence, which is hardly his fault, but the one player who could not quite catch a break in attack. Timing slightly out, but we are quibbling. <strong>4</strong></p> <p><strong>Ruaridh McConn</strong><strong>ochie </strong>Not a lot to do but chase kicks for the most part, until he took his try with some aplomb just shy of the hour. Withdrawn a couple of minutes later. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>Jonathan Joseph </strong>Even at a World Cup, just looks in a different class. Was out-and-out brilliant only occasionally, but things happen all around him, or just look as if they could. <strong>8</strong></p> <p><strong>Piers Francis </strong>Was a handful in attack, finding gaps and keeping the ball alive. If the citers want more to sink their teeth into, his tackle on Will Hooley will no doubt be scrutinised. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>Joe Cokanasiga </strong>A big bundle of muscle and rawness. By the end, that was the last thing a wilting USA wanted to encounter. A little loose with his handling. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>George Ford (capt) </strong>He really is a tease. Better defences than this will be confounded by the deftness and variety of his approach play. Looking very confident indeed. <strong>8 (man of the match)</strong></p> <p><strong>Willi Heinz </strong>He is not going to let anyone down, no matter how people feel about his selection ahead of others. Bossed it as if this were Gloucester. Or Christchurch. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>Joe Marler </strong>England had barely any defending to do, so left Big Joe free to focus on the scrum. Lovely. A bit of ball in hand would have been nice but can\u2019t have everything. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>Luke Cowan-Dickie </strong>His lineout throwing will be tested more thoroughly, but sound here. Plenty of action in attack. Hands could have been better. Took his try well enough. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>Dan Cole </strong>He had one job, and he did it very well. Exploited early disruption to the USA scrum like the old pro he is. Might even have touched the ball once, too. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>Joe Launchbury </strong>Typically excellent, all things to all men and must wonder who he upset to coincide with this generation of locks. Couple of handling errors, but if you offer yourself so much... <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>George Kruis </strong>Faultless on his own ball and a menace on theirs. Waded through their mauls, guided his own, constant support play and continuity. <strong>8</strong></p> <p><strong>Tom Curry </strong>Of the contending flankers he still looks the best, his touches in attack reminding us of what the old No 7s looked like. Does the dirty stuff, too. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>Lewis Ludlam </strong>The fairy tale continues. Took a while (a half, in fact) to grow into game, but then you could not stop him. Bagged himself a try, too. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>Billy Vunipola </strong>Absolutely fundamental to England\u2019s plans. The relentless carrying was all there \u2013 and regularly decisive. Just a bit too loose, though, to graduate with a first from this one. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>Replacements</strong> Ellis Genge (for Marler h-t) <strong>8</strong>; Kyle Sinckler (for Cole h-t) <strong>7</strong>; Mark Wilson (for Vunipola h-t) <strong>8</strong>; Courtney Lawes<strong> </strong>(for Launchbury 50); Ben Youngs (for Heinz 50); Owen Farrell (for Francis 50); Anthony Watson (for McConnochie 61); Jack Singleton (for Cowan-Dickie 72).</p> <h2>USA</h2> <p><strong>Will Hooley </strong>His night ended with a nasty injury and nearly began with one. Looked a little lost in between, possibly with good reason, struggling under high ball. <strong>4</strong></p> <p><strong>Blaine Scully (capt) </strong>Not much for a winger to do on a night such as this. He tackled a rampaging Cokanasiga superbly when it mattered but missed a rampaging Genge when it did not. <strong>5</strong></p> <p><strong>Marcel Brache </strong>USA\u2019s centres had a lot of work to do and for the most part they did it. Brache did miss a few tackles, but he will not be the first against this lot. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>Paul Lasike </strong>Central stone of a midfield that stood up well, despite such a paucity of possession to call its own. His were the more noticeable charges, and few went through him. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>Martin Iosefo </strong>Interesting duel with his old foe from the sevens circuit, but the odds were stacked against him. Finally yielded as McConnochie stepped inside him for his try. <strong>4</strong></p> <p><strong>AJ MacGinty</strong> If only we had seen more of him with ball in hand, but he defended as manfully as any fly-half could be expected to do. Glimpses of class on a difficult night.<strong> 7</strong></p> <p><strong>Shaun Davies </strong>One poor clearance kick in the first half, but his box-kicking thereafter was great. He is not afraid of a tackle either, which is just as well against 70% possession. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>David Ainuu </strong>Big moment for the teenager of Toulouse mixing it with the old men of the front row. Alas, it lasted but a moment, injured at the first scrum. <strong>n/a</strong></p> <p><strong>Joe Taufete\u2019e </strong>Throwing in not bad, with only one going west. Scrum so-so. USA just did not see enough ball for him and his mates to throw themselves round. <strong>4</strong></p> <p><strong>Titi Lamositele </strong>Could not get anything going. None of the rambunctious charging we see in a Saracens shirt. USA scrum secured most of its own ball but suffered on England\u2019s put-in. <strong>4</strong></p> <p><strong>Ben Landry </strong>USA\u2019s locks were beacons of industry and technical excellence.

      "bodyText": "England Elliot Daly Untested in defence, which is hardly his fault, but the one player who could not quite catch a break in attack. Timing slightly out, but we are quibbling. 4 Ruaridh McConnochie Not a lot to do but chase kicks for the most part, until he took his try with some aplomb just shy of the hour. Withdrawn a couple of minutes later. 6 Jonathan Joseph Even at a World Cup, just looks in a different class. Was out-and-out brilliant only occasionally, but things happen all around him, or just look as if they could. 8 Piers Francis Was a handful in attack, finding gaps and keeping the ball alive. If the citers want more to sink their teeth into, his tackle on Will Hooley will no doubt be scrutinised. 7 Joe Cokanasiga A big bundle of muscle and rawness. By the end, that was the last thing a wilting USA wanted to encounter. A little loose with his handling. 6 George Ford (capt) He really is a tease. Better defences than this will be confounded by the deftness and variety of his approach play. Looking very confident indeed. 8 (man of the match) Willi Heinz He is not going to let anyone down, no matter how people feel about his selection ahead of others. Bossed it as if this were Gloucester. Or Christchurch. 7 Joe Marler England had barely any defending to do, so left Big Joe free to focus on the scrum. Lovely. A bit of ball in hand would have been nice but can\u2019t have everything. 6 Luke Cowan-Dickie His lineout throwing will be tested more thoroughly, but sound here. Plenty of action in attack. Hands could have been better. Took his try well enough. 6 Dan Cole He had one job, and he did it very well. Exploited early disruption to the USA scrum like the old pro he is. Might even have touched the ball once, too. 6 Joe Launchbury Typically excellent, all things to all men and must wonder who he upset to coincide with this generation of locks. Couple of handling errors, but if you offer yourself so much... 7 George Kruis Faultless on his own ball and a menace on theirs. Waded through their mauls, guided his own, constant support play and continuity. 8 Tom Curry Of the contending flankers he still looks the best, his touches in attack reminding us of what the old No 7s looked like. Does the dirty stuff, too. 7 Lewis Ludlam The fairy tale continues. Took a while (a half, in fact) to grow into game, but then you could not stop him. Bagged himself a try, too. 7 Billy Vunipola Absolutely fundamental to England\u2019s plans. The relentless carrying was all there \u2013 and regularly decisive. Just a bit too loose, though, to graduate with a first from this one. 6 Replacements Ellis Genge (for Marler h-t) 8; Kyle Sinckler (for Cole h-t) 7; Mark Wilson (for Vunipola h-t) 8; Courtney Lawes (for Launchbury 50); Ben Youngs (for Heinz 50); Owen Farrell (for Francis 50); Anthony Watson (for McConnochie 61); Jack Singleton (for Cowan-Dickie 72). USA Will Hooley His night ended with a nasty injury and nearly began with one. Looked a little lost in between, possibly with good reason, struggling under high ball. 4 Blaine Scully (capt) Not much for a winger to do on a night such as this. He tackled a rampaging Cokanasiga superbly when it mattered but missed a rampaging Genge when it did not. 5 Marcel Brache USA\u2019s centres had a lot of work to do and for the most part they did it. Brache did miss a few tackles, but he will not be the first against this lot. 6 Paul Lasike Central stone of a midfield that stood up well, despite such a paucity of possession to call its own. His were the more noticeable charges, and few went through him. 6 Martin Iosefo Interesting duel with his old foe from the sevens circuit, but the odds were stacked against him. Finally yielded as McConnochie stepped inside him for his try. 4 AJ MacGinty If only we had seen more of him with ball in hand, but he defended as manfully as any fly-half could be expected to do. Glimpses of class on a difficult night. 7 Shaun Davies One poor clearance kick in the first half, but his box-kicking thereafter was great. He is not afraid of a tackle either, which is just as well against 70% possession. 6 David Ainuu Big moment for the teenager of Toulouse mixing it with the old men of the front row. Alas, it lasted but a moment, injured at the first scrum. n/a Joe Taufete\u2019e Throwing in not bad, with only one going west. Scrum so-so. USA just did not see enough ball for him and his mates to throw themselves round. 4 Titi Lamositele Could not get anything going. None of the rambunctious charging we see in a Saracens shirt. USA scrum secured most of its own ball but suffered on England\u2019s put-in. 4 Ben Landry USA\u2019s locks were beacons of industry and technical excellence. He was guilty of a couple of early errors but fought to the very end. 7 Nick Civetta If it is possible to be heroic yet dominated at the same time, this guy was it. He and his partner in engine room were manful. Solid at the lineout, too. 7 Tony Lamborn Worked hard and was USA\u2019s top tackler, despite his withdrawal on the hour. Discipline a bit loose at times, as was his handling, but he clearly means things. 5 John Quill World Cup\u2019s first red card and there can\u2019t be much argument in the current climate. The game seemed to be passing him by anyway, although did his fair share of tackling. 3 Cam Dolan Not a night to be a back-row forward when on the back foot like this. He is one of USA\u2019s classier players but no chance to show it. 5 Replacements Olive Kilifi (for Ainuu 3) 3; Paul Mullen (for Lamositele 43); Greg Peterson (for Civetta 52); Ruben de Haas (for Davies 52); Dylan Fawsitt (for Taufete\u2019e 61); Hanco Germishuys (for Lamborn 61); Bryce Campbell (for Lasike 61); Mike Te\u2019o for (Iosefo 73).",

The next phase is ensuring its long-term protection by setting up <em>Amigos de los Parques</em> (Friends of the Parks), a scheme to encourage Chileans to feel a pride in their national parks system; a private-public fund to ensure the parks are properly maintained; and the establishment of the Route of Parks to promote the region locally, nationally and internationally.</p> <p> Tompkins said she was conflicted when it came to tourism. She believes it can be a force for good where it contributes to the restoration of nature, but should be managed with stricter controls. \u201cTourism is by nature skimming the cream off the natural and cultural top. [Visitors] need to leave more behind than just paying for a dinner. Personally, I think there should be more tourism taxes. And then the government has to know how to use that money.\u201d</p> <p>Looking back over 25 years of philanthropic work, she said her proudest achievement was the creation of <a href=\"http://www.tompkinsconservation.org/news/2019/01/21/kawesqar-national-park-the-second-largest-national-park-in-chile-is-created/\" title=\"\">Kaw\u00e9sqar national park</a>, a vast region of mountains, forests, glaciers, fjords, lakes, wetlands and valleys of the west coast. The Tompkinses owned 28,000 hectares of it and used it as leverage to persuade the state to give 4 million hectares to form the second-largest national park in Chile (after Bernardo O\u2019Higgins). About 26,000sq km of surrounding water is also protected.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1e36b0d2bb0ccc5a3371574d930cf460e346edce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e36b0d2bb0ccc5a3371574d930cf460e346edce/0_197_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Parque Nacional Queulat, Patagonia, Chile\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Parque Nacional Queulat, Patagonia</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Future conservation work will focus on areas where land meets sea with the aim of winning protection for marine areas.

After 25 years of strategic land acquisition by Kristine Tompkins and her late husband Douglas \u2013 which led to the creation last year of five new national parks in southern Chile \u2013 Tompkins said the next challenge was to encourage 60 communities across the region to develop tourism ventures that will help protect the biodiversity on their doorstep. Speaking in London at the European launch of the 1,700-mile Route of Parks, a marketing initiative encompassing 17 national parks throughout Patagonia, Tompkins said: \u201cWe want local people to have a sense of ownership and pride. They will become the first line of defence in conservation.\u201d While the main hubs of Chilean Patagonia \u2013 Punta Arenas, Puerto Montt, Balmaceda, and the Torres del Paine national park \u2013 already have well-established tourist infrastructure, Tompkins hopes communities across the region will see the Route of Parks as an opportunity to start tourism ventures for all budgets. \u201cWe want backpackers and people who can only afford to camp \u2013 we want an assortment of offers.\u201d A team from the foundation has already travelled around Patagonia visiting towns and villages to talk about the reason for the parks\u2019 existence \u2013 to \u201cthrow the brake on the extinction crisis\u201d by restoring the landscape to its natural state and where necessary reintroduce endangered species \u2013 and to encourage local people to establish tourist services that will create income for communities and contribute to the long-term preservation of wild habitat. The Tompkins Foundation has developed trails and infrastructure in two of the five new parks, Parque Patagonia and Pumal\u00edn \u2013 the former has two small lodges, three campgrounds and a visitor centre; the latter has nine cabins and a network of campgrounds. But the aim is for communities to develop low-impact accommodation, guide and transport services, cultural tours and more around all the parks. As a result, vast swaths of Patagonia such as the spectacular but overlooked Ays\u00e9n region will become more accessible, taking the pressure off Torres del Paine, where the W trail is so busy in peak season that travellers have complained of overcrowding. UK-based travel company Pura Aventura, which has been selling holidays to Patagonia for 20 years, said the work of the Tompkins Foundation was a game-changer for tourism. \u201cFrom our point of view it\u2019s very exciting that an organisation with the heft of Tompkins is opening this [region] up because it means an almost endless supply of extraordinary places become accessible in a way that\u2019s not going to be harmful.

Starting in northern Patagonia, Route of Parks is an epic scenic highway taking in three existing routes: the Carretera Austral road between Puerto Montt and Villa O\u2019Higgins, the central fjordlands (accessible by ferry only) and the End of the World route in the far south, ending at Cape Horn. The launch of the route \u2013 which is broken down into different itineraries on the website \u2013 follows the creation of five new national parks and the expansion of three others, all in Chilean Patagonia after the Tompkins Foundation handed over a million acres to the Chilean state \u2013 the largest private donation of land ever. The handover was the culmination of 25 years of strategic land acquisition by Kristine and Douglas (who died in a kayaking accident in 2015), aimed at returning farmed land to its natural state and creating wildlife corridors. The Foundation also owns land in Argentina, where its flagship rewilding project is seeing species being reintroduced to the newly created Iber\u00e1 national park in the north-west. In January, three jaguars will be introduced. In total the Tompkins\u2019 philanthropic work amounts to $345m. Tompkins said she was still shocked at the successful outcome of her and her husband\u2019s vision which began in 1991 with the purchase of 200,000 acres at the toe of Re\u00f1ihu\u00e9 Fjord in what is now Pumal\u00edn national park. \u201cWe made the outrageous proposal to create five parks and expand three more and I\u2019m still dumbfounded that it reached its conclusion.\u201d As a result 91% of Chile\u2019s protected land is in Patagonia. Over the decades a multitude of rewilding projects have included removing 25,000 sheep and 500 miles of fencing in what is now Parque Patagonia, the recovery of endemic species including guanacos, Andean deer, and Darwin\u2019s rhea and encouraging well-managed agriculture to serve as biophysical buffers. To date the Foundation has helped protect 5.75 million hectares across Chile and Argentina. The next phase is ensuring its long-term protection by setting up Amigos de los Parques (Friends of the Parks), a scheme to encourage Chileans to feel a pride in their national parks system; a private-public fund to ensure the parks are properly maintained; and the establishment of the Route of Parks to promote the region locally, nationally and internationally. Tompkins said she was conflicted when it came to tourism. She believes it can be a force for good where it contributes to the restoration of nature, but should be managed with stricter controls. \u201cTourism is by nature skimming the cream off the natural and cultural top. [Visitors] need to leave more behind than just paying for a dinner. Personally, I think there should be more tourism taxes. And then the government has to know how to use that money.\u201d Looking back over 25 years of philanthropic work, she said her proudest achievement was the creation of Kaw\u00e9sqar national park, a vast region of mountains, forests, glaciers, fjords, lakes, wetlands and valleys of the west coast. The Tompkinses owned 28,000 hectares of it and used it as leverage to persuade the state to give 4 million hectares to form the second-largest national park in Chile (after Bernardo O\u2019Higgins). About 26,000sq km of surrounding water is also protected. Future conservation work will focus on areas where land meets sea with the aim of winning protection for marine areas. Ever ambitious, Tompkins is going for the highest level of protection there is: \u201cWe are trying to get waters established as no-take zones.\u201d Alongside the continued conservation work across the region, Tompkins said she wanted to position the foundation as a supporter of the youth climate activism movement, both financially and in terms of direct involvement. \u201cI personally want to be involved and I want my teams to be involved. We should be joining the marches. If there is no march in an area where we work, we should help support one. \u201cI listened to Greta\u2019s speech at the United Nations summit and I can\u2019t remember feeling this way in over 30 years. It\u2019s brilliant. I have zero faith in governments but I see hope in the work we do and in Greta and her pals. We have to join them [young people]. If we have any moral compass this is the time and I will be there.\u201d \u2022 See a comprehensive map of the Route of Parks",

Last week, once the threat of early elections had been seen off, Renzi announced that he was splitting from the PD to form a new centrist party, <a href=\"https://www.southeusummit.com/europe/italy/italys-ex-pm-matteo-renzi-splits-from-centre-left-to-found-new-centrist-party/\" title=\"\">Italia Viva</a>.</p> <p>While little is yet known about its programme, the stated aim of the new parliamentary group \u2013 \u201cto bring passion and participation back into politics\u201d \u2013 is typical of the kind of hyper-optimistic and sometimes shallow rhetoric that propelled Renzi to power in the first place. The schism had been a long time coming. Even before Renzi, the PD had been divided down the middle between old \u201ccentrist\u201d Christian Democrats and those with leftwing, socialist allegiances. Italia Viva\u2019s 41 parliamentarians have so far come overwhelmingly from the former camp.</p> <p>Make no mistake, Renzi\u2019s decision to bring down Salvini was motivated as much by self-interest as blocking the far right.

      "body": "<p>\u201cI like the goal, yeah,\u201d Zinedine Zidane said, \u201cbut I like controls more, and his control was the <em>hostia</em>.\u201d Which was one, pretty good way of putting it. The <em>hostia</em> is the body of Christ, the holy host, the consecrated bread, and bloody brilliant \u2013 a Spanish equivalent of the dog\u2019s dingly-danglies \u2013 and Real Madrid\u2019s manager was right. What Rodrygo had just done was special; where he had done it and <em>when</em> he had done it was, too. It was 10.30pm on Wednesday when Casemiro\u2019s long, high diagonal reached him way over on the left. His first touch was impeccable, the ball tamed with the outside of his right foot, supposedly the wrong one, and coaxed into obediently joining him as he set off. Five seconds later, it was in the net.</p> \n<p>He was 94 seconds into his Real Madrid career.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/26/barcelona-fined-300-euros-breaking-rules-antoine-griezmann-signing-atletico-madrid-football\">Barcelona fined only \u20ac300 for breaking rules when signing Antoine Griezmann</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>As the ball dropped, TV commentator Jos\u00e9 Sanch\u00eds had cooed: \u201cOh, I love that control.\u201d As it hit the back of the net, he had shouted: \u201cI can\u2019t believe it.\u201d All around him, they couldn\u2019t believe it, either. Some 57,270 people leapt. Lots laughed, which is what you\u2019re supposed to do when something like that happens. Suddenly, there was this 18-year-old they\u2019d never seen play kneeling then bowing before the Bernab\u00e9u, doffing an imaginary hat, and all was well with the world.</p> \n<p>It had happened fast. Signed for \u20ac45m in 2018, Rodrygo didn\u2019t actually join Madrid until this summer and hadn\u2019t played a competitive game. At the weekend he didn\u2019t even play for Castilla, the B team, for whom he had missed a penalty in his only appearance. Instead he travelled with the first team to Sevilla only to be left out of the squad entirely. \u201cWe know exactly what we\u2019re doing with him,\u201d Zidane insisted on Tuesday and the following night he stood on the touchline with his arm around the Brazilian\u2019s shoulder, whispering in his ear. The clock showed 70.22 when Rodrygo ran on and, while it wasn\u2019t actually the first ball he touched, 71.56 when he scored <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sidlowe/status/1176959087038345222\">to make it 2-0</a> against Osasuna.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1176958157156954113\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83d\ude0e Just on the pitch a few seconds and what a cool finish this is from 18-year-old Rodrygo to make it 2-0!<br><br>\u26aa What a night for Real Madrid's young Brazilians! <a href=\"https://t.co/yYDmN4QfeC\">pic.twitter.com/yYDmN4QfeC</a></p>\u2014 Premier Sports \ud83d\udcfa (@PremierSportsTV) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1176958157156954113?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 25, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember a debut like this,\u201d Sanch\u00eds had said. Alongside him, Jorge Valdano noted: \u201cIt might not exist.\u201d</p> \n<p>There have been pretty special starts for Madrid before: everyone remembers Robinho at C\u00e1diz, David Beckham had scored 124 seconds into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2003/sep/01/europeanfootball.sport\">his first game at the Bernab\u00e9u</a> and there may, genuinely, never have been a beginning quite like Jonathan Woodgate\u2019s, which he neatly summed up in two words afterwards: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/sep/23/newsstory.sport8\">\u201cfuck\u201d and \u201cme\u201d</a>. But there haven\u2019t been many like this. Only two foreigners have scored for Madrid younger than Rodrygo \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jan/30/real-madrid-barcelona-copa-del-rey\">Rapha\u00ebl Varane</a> and Vinicius \u2013 and no Madrid player has ever scored <a href=\"https://twitter.com/2010MisterChip/status/1176963475769368576?s=20\">their first league goal faster</a>. Only (original) Ronaldo, who\u2019d been at Barcelona before, scored quicker on his Madrid debut: it took him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/oct/07/europeanfootball.sport2\">64 seconds</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf I could control it well, I thought the rest would come off well,\u201d Rodrygo said afterwards, still in his kit, wearing flip-flops and looking every bit as young as he is. \u201cI don\u2019t really have the words for this.

A few metres away, beneath the Bernab\u00e9u stands, Osasuna\u2019s Fran M\u00e9rida, who joined Arsenal at 17, was asked if everyone risked running ahead of themselves. \u201cRodrygo\u2019s the one running,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Week six had been marked by kids, born after 2000. Six hundred kilometres to the north-east they were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/16/a-star-is-born-ansu-fati-announces-himself-and-changes-his-world-barcelona-la-liga\">still talking about Ansu Fati</a>, again impressing for Barcelona\u2019s after a late cameo in a 2-1 win over Villarreal; 350km away on the east coast, Kang-in Lee had just scored his first for Valencia in a wild 3-3 draw with Getafe. Aged 18 years and seven months, only two younger players have ever scored for the club. Over in Palma, meanwhile, Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix scored the second in a 2-0 win over Mallorca. Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\u2019s most expensive player ever, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/04/joao-felix-atletico-madrid-gamble-diego-simeone\">he\u2019s still only 19</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/16/a-star-is-born-ansu-fati-announces-himself-and-changes-his-world-barcelona-la-liga\">'A star is born': Ansu Fati announces himself and changes his world | Sid Lowe</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>They are related, especially at Barcelona and Madrid. As the radios raved, some of the same things said about Fati come up again. Not least because, in that tiresome way that it\u2019s always about <em>them</em>, the clubs that can\u2019t live with each other and can\u2019t live without each other either, Annie Oakley and Frank Butler <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO23WBji_Z0\">going at it again</a>. As if it\u2019s not hard enough to live with your own club\u2019s expectations; you have to match the expectations of your rivals too. Yet the concerns expressed parallels as well, an awareness of what could go wrong, of the warping power of expectation and pressure.</p> \n<p>Back at the Bernab\u00e9u, Merida said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare to tell anyone how to handle it; there are no lessons.\u201d Yet there are many: countless examples and warnings, reasons why people try to rein in their excitement, even if they can\u2019t help it. There\u2019s always that slither of fear lurking in the excitement, a reluctance to emotionally invest, a concern at getting too excited and getting hurt, a resistance to playing a part in potential going unrealised and the dream dying. No one wants to be responsible somehow. Or, worse still, wrong.</p> \n<p>There is a word used endlessly here that doesn\u2019t translate well: <em>ilusi\u00f3n</em>. A false friend \u2013 and rarely has that description fitted better \u2013 it\u2019s not illusion; it\u2019s more like hope, excitement, enthusiasm, joy, a dream even. And yet it can become an illusion too, sometimes precisely because of the <em>ilusi\u00f3n</em>. Bojan Krkic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/mar/16/la-liga-spain-bojan-barcelona-sid-lowe\">broke Barcelona records</a> and it broke him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/18/bojan-krkic-interview-anxiety-attacks-football\">for a while</a>. Gerard Deulofeu <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/oct/16/gerard-deulofeu-everton-homecoming\">was the best</a> player many of them <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/spanish-primera-division/15/blog/post/3176052/gerard-deulofeu-back-at-barcelona-with-another-chance-to-become-a-club-star\">had seen</a>. In the end, though, neither was the new anything. Robinho started as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/nov/12/europeanfootball.sport3\">a saviour</a>, but ended up as a triathlete in a joke: <em>corre, bicicleta y nada</em>, it runs and although it doesn\u2019t translate it\u2019s enough to know that, if a little unfairly, he became someone to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/sep/02/manchestercity.premierleague3\">laugh at</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9aba6b18636898c53209c515302164dec03d12fd\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9aba6b18636898c53209c515302164dec03d12fd/0_0_3678_2452/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rodrygo runs at Osasuna.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rodrygo runs at Osasuna.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Quality Sport Images/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>If Rodrygo (or the rest of us) needed any other warning, an indication of how hard it can be, there was also the man he replaced. The man? The boy. Light amid the gloom last season, the excitement building, a glorious future assumed and celebrated before it had actually happened, Vinicius\u2019s performances had delighted but then dipped. He had suffered injury and hadn\u2019t scored in 16 games. Chances slipped away, each more painful than the last. Then, at last, he bent a superb shot into the corner, taking a deflection en route. Madrid were 1-0 up and Vinicius slipped to his knees and sobbed, released at last.</p> \n<p>\u201cSince my injury, everything was hard,\u201d Vinicius said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t the happy person I am. I have lifted that weight off now and I\u2019m delighted to please the Bernab\u00e9u again.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1176944779957014528\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\u26bd Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior curls one into the top corner to give Real Madrid the lead!<br><br>\u2b50 It's the first goal of the season for the young Brazilian star, and look at what it means to him! <a href=\"https://t.co/7inBbhtzZr\">pic.twitter.com/7inBbhtzZr</a></p>\u2014 Premier Sports \ud83d\udcfa (@PremierSportsTV) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1176944779957014528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 25, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m happy for them; you could see the emotion when they scored, what it meant,\u201d Zidane said. \u201cWe sometimes forget they\u2019re both just 18.\u201d Vinicius is actually 19 now, but the point remained. And for all the lessons, the warnings, there are examples that say the opposite. The <em>ilusi\u00f3n</em> is natural, it is right: it\u2019s also the point. What is football, what is life, without it? Even the most rubbish teams live in hope. Iker Casillas was at school in a drawing class when they came for him; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/nov/03/iker-casillas-real-madrid-spain-liverpool-european-cup\">he won the World Cup</a>. Valdano confided to Ra\u00fal that he was thinking of playing him but worried that he might freeze. Ra\u00fal, aged 17, replied: \u201cIf you want to win, put me in; if not, don\u2019t.\u201d He missed sitters that day, and became the best player Madrid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/nov/13/raul-retires-new-york-cosmos-real-madrid-spain\">ever brought through</a>. And there <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/mar/12/europeanfootball.sport1\">was</a></em> something about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/dec/10/his-magnum-opus-even-for-lionel-messi-this-was-special\">Messi</a>.</p> \n<p>Besides, it is too often forgotten that there is dignity, joy and triumph in careers, even when they aren\u2019t what others demanded they become. There is life beyond those teams. There\u2019s a second chance. And a third, a fourth, a fifth. There\u2019s also time. Ask Bojan, finding satisfaction in his success, no one else\u2019s; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/18/bojan-krkic-interview-anxiety-attacks-football\">finding enjoyment too</a>. Ask 37-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/jan/21/jorge-molina-road-to-verge-europe-getafe-la-liga\">Jorge Molina</a>; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/apr/26/yes-getafe-really-might-be-on-their-way-to-the-champions-league\">Jaime Mata</a>, who never even made it to primera until he was 29 and is now a Spain international; or Aritz Aduriz, whose goalscoring figures <em>improved</em> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/mar/03/aritz-aduriz-better-age-athletic-bilbao\">after he turned 30</a>. Or ask Martin Odegaard, who joined Madrid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/jan/22/martin-odegaard-real-madrid-norway-bernabeu\">at 16</a>, disappeared to most Spaniards, and has now reappeared aged 20, years still ahead of him and playing for Real Sociedad, with a genuine claim to be the best player in La Liga so far this season. Or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2010/jan/11/sergio-canales-la-liga-sid-lowe\">Sergio Canales</a>, able to be himself on his own terms, one of Spain\u2019s outstanding players, an international many years and many injuries after that teenage move to the Bernab\u00e9u.</p> \n<p>Best of all, ask the two men who really marked week six in La Liga. Because while there\u2019s a thrill in seeing young players suddenly emerge, there\u2019s something special, maybe even deeper, in seeing the men who resist, who belie their years at the other end of the scale. If kids are alright, the adults might be even better. Especially when they are like these two, made to make you smile.</p> \n<p>Santi Cazorla is 34, has been operated on 10 times and was told he would be lucky to be able to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/sep/07/santi-cazorla-villarreal-injury-arsenal-interview-sid-lowe\">walk around the garden with his son</a>, but refused to give in and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/spanish-primera-division/15/blog/post/3618544/spanish-football-rejoices-as-santi-cazorla-returns-to-action-with-villarreal\">returned</a>, still playing <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/spanish-primera-division/15/blog/post/3743116/santi-cazorla-shows-real-madrid-spain-arsenal-that-hes-still-got-the-magic-at-villarreal\">like no one else</a> \u2013 included in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/may/30/its-the-sids-2019-the-complete-review-of-la-liga-2018-19-season-barcelona-real-madrid-atletico-valencia-getafe-iago-aspas\">last season\u2019s best XI</a> in La Liga, he may be on course for this season\u2019s too.

      "bodyText": "\u201cI like the goal, yeah,\u201d Zinedine Zidane said, \u201cbut I like controls more, and his control was the hostia.\u201d Which was one, pretty good way of putting it. The hostia is the body of Christ, the holy host, the consecrated bread, and bloody brilliant \u2013 a Spanish equivalent of the dog\u2019s dingly-danglies \u2013 and Real Madrid\u2019s manager was right. What Rodrygo had just done was special; where he had done it and when he had done it was, too. It was 10.30pm on Wednesday when Casemiro\u2019s long, high diagonal reached him way over on the left. His first touch was impeccable, the ball tamed with the outside of his right foot, supposedly the wrong one, and coaxed into obediently joining him as he set off. Five seconds later, it was in the net. He was 94 seconds into his Real Madrid career. As the ball dropped, TV commentator Jos\u00e9 Sanch\u00eds had cooed: \u201cOh, I love that control.\u201d As it hit the back of the net, he had shouted: \u201cI can\u2019t believe it.\u201d All around him, they couldn\u2019t believe it, either. Some 57,270 people leapt. Lots laughed, which is what you\u2019re supposed to do when something like that happens. Suddenly, there was this 18-year-old they\u2019d never seen play kneeling then bowing before the Bernab\u00e9u, doffing an imaginary hat, and all was well with the world. It had happened fast. Signed for \u20ac45m in 2018, Rodrygo didn\u2019t actually join Madrid until this summer and hadn\u2019t played a competitive game. At the weekend he didn\u2019t even play for Castilla, the B team, for whom he had missed a penalty in his only appearance. Instead he travelled with the first team to Sevilla only to be left out of the squad entirely. \u201cWe know exactly what we\u2019re doing with him,\u201d Zidane insisted on Tuesday and the following night he stood on the touchline with his arm around the Brazilian\u2019s shoulder, whispering in his ear. The clock showed 70.22 when Rodrygo ran on and, while it wasn\u2019t actually the first ball he touched, 71.56 when he scored to make it 2-0 against Osasuna. \u201cI don\u2019t remember a debut like this,\u201d Sanch\u00eds had said. Alongside him, Jorge Valdano noted: \u201cIt might not exist.\u201d There have been pretty special starts for Madrid before: everyone remembers Robinho at C\u00e1diz, David Beckham had scored 124 seconds into his first game at the Bernab\u00e9u and there may, genuinely, never have been a beginning quite like Jonathan Woodgate\u2019s, which he neatly summed up in two words afterwards: \u201cfuck\u201d and \u201cme\u201d. But there haven\u2019t been many like this. Only two foreigners have scored for Madrid younger than Rodrygo \u2013 Rapha\u00ebl Varane and Vinicius \u2013 and no Madrid player has ever scored their first league goal faster. Only (original) Ronaldo, who\u2019d been at Barcelona before, scored quicker on his Madrid debut: it took him 64 seconds. \u201cIf I could control it well, I thought the rest would come off well,\u201d Rodrygo said afterwards, still in his kit, wearing flip-flops and looking every bit as young as he is. \u201cI don\u2019t really have the words for this. I\u2019m lucky.\u201d And so it starts; the excitement, the expectation, the pressure. A few metres away, beneath the Bernab\u00e9u stands, Osasuna\u2019s Fran M\u00e9rida, who joined Arsenal at 17, was asked if everyone risked running ahead of themselves. \u201cRodrygo\u2019s the one running,\u201d he said. Week six had been marked by kids, born after 2000. Six hundred kilometres to the north-east they were still talking about Ansu Fati, again impressing for Barcelona\u2019s after a late cameo in a 2-1 win over Villarreal; 350km away on the east coast, Kang-in Lee had just scored his first for Valencia in a wild 3-3 draw with Getafe. Aged 18 years and seven months, only two younger players have ever scored for the club. Over in Palma, meanwhile, Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix scored the second in a 2-0 win over Mallorca. Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\u2019s most expensive player ever, he\u2019s still only 19. They are related, especially at Barcelona and Madrid. As the radios raved, some of the same things said about Fati come up again. Not least because, in that tiresome way that it\u2019s always about them, the clubs that can\u2019t live with each other and can\u2019t live without each other either, Annie Oakley and Frank Butler going at it again. As if it\u2019s not hard enough to live with your own club\u2019s expectations; you have to match the expectations of your rivals too. Yet the concerns expressed parallels as well, an awareness of what could go wrong, of the warping power of expectation and pressure. Back at the Bernab\u00e9u, Merida said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare to tell anyone how to handle it; there are no lessons.\u201d Yet there are many: countless examples and warnings, reasons why people try to rein in their excitement, even if they can\u2019t help it. There\u2019s always that slither of fear lurking in the excitement, a reluctance to emotionally invest, a concern at getting too excited and getting hurt, a resistance to playing a part in potential going unrealised and the dream dying. No one wants to be responsible somehow. Or, worse still, wrong. There is a word used endlessly here that doesn\u2019t translate well: ilusi\u00f3n. A false friend \u2013 and rarely has that description fitted better \u2013 it\u2019s not illusion; it\u2019s more like hope, excitement, enthusiasm, joy, a dream even. And yet it can become an illusion too, sometimes precisely because of the ilusi\u00f3n. Bojan Krkic broke Barcelona records and it broke him for a while. Gerard Deulofeu was the best player many of them had seen. In the end, though, neither was the new anything. Robinho started as a saviour, but ended up as a triathlete in a joke: corre, bicicleta y nada, it runs and although it doesn\u2019t translate it\u2019s enough to know that, if a little unfairly, he became someone to laugh at. If Rodrygo (or the rest of us) needed any other warning, an indication of how hard it can be, there was also the man he replaced. The man? The boy. Light amid the gloom last season, the excitement building, a glorious future assumed and celebrated before it had actually happened, Vinicius\u2019s performances had delighted but then dipped. He had suffered injury and hadn\u2019t scored in 16 games. Chances slipped away, each more painful than the last. Then, at last, he bent a superb shot into the corner, taking a deflection en route. Madrid were 1-0 up and Vinicius slipped to his knees and sobbed, released at last. \u201cSince my injury, everything was hard,\u201d Vinicius said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t the happy person I am. I have lifted that weight off now and I\u2019m delighted to please the Bernab\u00e9u again.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m happy for them; you could see the emotion when they scored, what it meant,\u201d Zidane said. \u201cWe sometimes forget they\u2019re both just 18.\u201d Vinicius is actually 19 now, but the point remained. And for all the lessons, the warnings, there are examples that say the opposite. The ilusi\u00f3n is natural, it is right: it\u2019s also the point. What is football, what is life, without it? Even the most rubbish teams live in hope. Iker Casillas was at school in a drawing class when they came for him; he won the World Cup. Valdano confided to Ra\u00fal that he was thinking of playing him but worried that he might freeze. Ra\u00fal, aged 17, replied: \u201cIf you want to win, put me in; if not, don\u2019t.\u201d He missed sitters that day, and became the best player Madrid ever brought through. And there was something about Messi. Besides, it is too often forgotten that there is dignity, joy and triumph in careers, even when they aren\u2019t what others demanded they become. There is life beyond those teams. There\u2019s a second chance. And a third, a fourth, a fifth. There\u2019s also time. Ask Bojan, finding satisfaction in his success, no one else\u2019s; finding enjoyment too. Ask 37-year-old Jorge Molina; Jaime Mata, who never even made it to primera until he was 29 and is now a Spain international; or Aritz Aduriz, whose goalscoring figures improved after he turned 30. Or ask Martin Odegaard, who joined Madrid at 16, disappeared to most Spaniards, and has now reappeared aged 20, years still ahead of him and playing for Real Sociedad, with a genuine claim to be the best player in La Liga so far this season. Or Sergio Canales, able to be himself on his own terms, one of Spain\u2019s outstanding players, an international many years and many injuries after that teenage move to the Bernab\u00e9u. Best of all, ask the two men who really marked week six in La Liga. Because while there\u2019s a thrill in seeing young players suddenly emerge, there\u2019s something special, maybe even deeper, in seeing the men who resist, who belie their years at the other end of the scale. If kids are alright, the adults might be even better. Especially when they are like these two, made to make you smile. Santi Cazorla is 34, has been operated on 10 times and was told he would be lucky to be able to walk around the garden with his son, but refused to give in and returned, still playing like no one else \u2013 included in last season\u2019s best XI in La Liga, he may be on course for this season\u2019s too. On Tuesday, he was handed a standing ovation by the Camp Nou, having outperformed everyone on the pitch and scored a brilliant goal. \u201cThat\u2019s what I will take with me when I retire,\u201d he said afterwards. And then there\u2019s the man the Benito Villamar\u00edn rose to applaud a little over an hour earlier. Joaqu\u00edn S\u00e1nchez left to an ovation after a ludicrous performance every bit as good as anyone of any age anywhere had produced for months. Everybody\u2019s favourite cheeky scamp, he\u2019s also a brilliant footballer still, maybe even better than he\u2019s ever been. He provided three perfect assists as Betis beat Levante 3-1, and produced a piece of skill so brilliant, so absurd, so maddening, that all you could do was fall about the kind of trick that, as teammate Borja Iglesias put it, \u201creally, really pisses you off\u201d if you\u2019re an opponent: a cola de vaca nutmeg, sweeping the ball through the legs of poor To\u00f1o that drew ol\u00e9s from everyone. Which was why on the day Fati proudly showed off his new, Spanish ID card, Joaqu\u00edn was asked to show his too \u2013 to prove that really was his date of birth. There\u2019s no way he could be 38, but he is. On Tuesday, Joaqu\u00edn played his 874th senior game; the day he played his first, Rodrygo hadn\u2019t even been born.",

The prison became a torture and execution centre, and more than 13,000 people are estimated to have died there since 2011.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8f389e90d36529d1ea230644b983d4affc141a26\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f389e90d36529d1ea230644b983d4affc141a26/0_0_5500_3300/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lawrence Abu Hamdan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lawrence Abu Hamdan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sound became the only way prisoners could begin to ascertain where they were and the space they inhabited.

Their guards played tricks on them by opening and closing doors, funnelling noise from one part of the prison to another, amplifying the sound of assaults. Working with former prisoners, Abu Hamdan had to resort to stock BBC and Warner Brothers sound effects, and to use foley artist techniques to help them remember \u2013 and describe \u2013 the aural world they had occupied. Abu Hamdan\u2019s \u201cearwitness\u201d testimonies led the artist to rethink space in terms of its acoustic properties, and the way sounds are recalled in memory, and how a mnemonic as much as an original sound can trigger memory in an \u201cacoustic flashback\u201d.</p> <p>Here, we, too, are in a darkened room, with sounds moving around and through us.

Their reason is that this play will embarrass and damage the Chinese government and the reputations of specific officials.\u201d",

JLR is among several carmakers that have repeatedly voiced grave concerns about the impact a no-deal Brexit would have on their industry.

Boris Johnson dismissed Speth\u2019s concerns in a radio interview on LBC earlier this year, insisting that it was not certain the JLR boss knew more about the car industry than he did. The LR shutdown will affect the firm\u2019s three car factories \u2013 at Halewood on Merseyside and Castle Bromwich and Solihull in the Midlands \u2013 which collectively built just under a third of Britain\u2019s 1.5m cars last year.

The move was intended to limit the cost of halting production by ensuring any disruption caused by Brexit came during a period when assembly lines were stationary. With Brexit delayed, however, the stoppages proved needless, prompting dismay in the automotive sector at the \u201cuntold damage\u201d being done to the industry by prolonged uncertainty. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said on Thursday a 3.3% increase in production numbers in August was not enough to make up for the lost output caused by the April production hiatus. This year, the British car industry witnessed its worst period of decline since 2001 as rising global trade tensions and Brexit uncertainty combined to provide a dire operating environment for manufacturers.",

      "bodyText": "The plea from the Labour MP Paula Sherriff for Boris Johnson and others to tone down their political rhetoric has returned the focus to the daily threats of violence faced by public figures. Are threats to public figures on the rise? Earlier this year, Cressida Dick, the Metropolitan police commissioner, told parliamentarians the number of threats to MPs had risen significantly. In the first five months of 2019, MPs reported 152 crimes to the police, who also received reports of another 600 incidents involving MPs. This is a 90% rise on the same period last year and the Met has predicted that if the trend continues, more than 450 crimes will be reported by the end of the year. In 2018, the number of crimes reported by MPs more than doubled from 151 in 2017 to 342. Dick said female MPs and MPs from ethnic minorities were disproportionately targeted, and about 10 MPs accounted for 29% of reports. How can the threats be dealt with? A range of charges can be used to tackle threats of violence, including making a threat to kill, sending malicious communications, or harassment. Threatening to kill is at the most serious end of such offending, carrying a potential 10-year prison sentence, but the charge is rarely used. Earlier this year, the Met commander Adrian Usher, told MPs: \u201cIt is a notoriously difficult offence to prove because it contains an element of intent, and as soon as we get into intent as a point to prove, my own experience in the courts is that that is very difficult.\u201d More commonly, offenders are convicted of harassment or malicious communications. Has any action been taken? There have been a number of successful prosecutions. Robert Vidler was jailed for 18 weeks after being convicted in August on three counts of sending menacing or obscene messages and five counts of harassment. He sent voicemails to several MPs saying he knew where they lived and their movements, and threatening to kill them. He sent Nick Boles, the independent MP for Grantham, a voicemail threatening to cut his throat \u201cif you fuck up Brexit\u201d. David Stuart, who was convicted in May on two counts of sending a threatening communication, received a 36-week prison sentence suspended for two years. He had sent threatening emails to Andy McDonald, the Labour MP for Middlesbrough, and Anna Soubry, the MP for Broxtowe and the leader of the Independent Group for Change. Jarod Kirkman was jailed for 42 weeks after being convicted in April on six counts of sending threatening messages to MPs. He sent the online communications to Heidi Allen, the independent MP for South Cambridgeshire, and David Lammy, the Labour MP for Tottenham, who are both remain campaigners. Using email addresses such as \u201cMP@deadpoliticianwalking.com\u201d and \u201cPutin@fsb.ru\u201d, with subject lines of \u201cBrexit traitor\u201d and \u201cBrexit loser\u201d, in one message to Allen he said, \u201cYour days are fucking numbered bitch\u201d, and to David Lammy he wrote: \u201cFuck off and die in the jungle.\u201d Does the language mirror that used in political debate? In some cases, yes. Earlier this month, Boris Johnson said during a speech in Yorkshire that he would \u201crather be dead in a ditch\u201d than agree to extend the Brexit deadline. On Wednesday, the Labour MP Jess Phillips tweeted a picture of a death threat she had received. The letter stated: \u201cIt was rather prophetic that Boris Johnson should say: \u2018I would rather be found dead in a ditch\u2019. That is what will happen to those who do not deliver Brexit.\u201d Sheriff, in her condemnation of the prime minister\u2019s language, detailed how daily death threats to her and fellow MPs \u201coften quote his [Johnson\u2019s] words \u2013 \u2018Surrender Act\u2019, \u2018betrayal\u2019, \u2018traitor\u2019 \u2013 and I for one am sick of it\u201d. When asked for his name in court, Jo Cox\u2019s killer, Thomas Mair, said: \u201cMy name is death to traitors, freedom for Britain.\u201d He also wrote about \u201ccollaborators\u201d. The far-right extremist Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, reportedly wrote on his official Telegram account that \u201c21 Tory traitors decided to side with Corbyn and the Labour traitors and try and block the Brexit that the majority of people voted for\u201d.",

It is a scenario that he reprinted in his florid autobiography, Flashback. The cheery chorine was to be played by Pearson\u2019s protege, and one of the biggest stars in British silent cinema, Betty Balfour.

Not surprisingly, she was once thought to be the feather in the cap of our national film industry. She led a successful film franchise, playing a cockney flower-girl called Squibs, acted for Alfred Hitchcock in his silent film Champagne and was popular with audiences and directors all over Europe. However, she found it hard to shake her cockney typecasting and her career faltered in the sound era. She died in 1977, aged 74, and by the turn of the 21st century the reputation of the woman once known as \u201cBritain\u2019s Queen of Happiness\u201d had gradually diminished \u2013 simply because the films she made were hard to see.</p> <p>So what can we expect from Love, Life and Laughter? Balfour\u2019s presence on screen is as magnetic as it is charming; if you have not seen her before, you may be surprised by the energy of her performance. She is constantly in motion, eyes twinkling and limbs snapping: a gamine with get-up-and-go. In this rags-to-riches story, she plays in the working-class mode for which she was most famous, but when she bursts out of that slum to become a star, she can indulge in the elegant 1920s glamour that suited her so well.</p> <p>It is a sentimental film, with a story-within-a-story narrative, and a central motif provided by a balloon-seller who lives in Tip-Toes\u2019s tenement building: \u201cThe \u2019opes of young people is like the air in balloons,\u201d he says. \u201cThe more \u2019ope, the \u2019igher you goes. Too much \u2019ope \u2013 bust!\u201d Tip-Toes becomes a star while the author suffers rejection, but even at the height of her fame she misses him and remembers their promise to meet again. There are still some segments of the film missing \u2013 about 20 minutes over the course of the feature \u2013 mostly, it is thought, dealing with the young man\u2019s story.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a29744acb2c7699a138af0bbcf90b18902776be4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a29744acb2c7699a138af0bbcf90b18902776be4/0_0_2847_2283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Balfour in Love, Life and Laughter.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"802\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Balfour in Love, Life and Laughter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BFI</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are some fascinating intersections of early 20th-century musical culture at play here, too. Pearson\u2019s first inspiration for the film was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/oct/09/death-of-marie-lloyd\" title=\"\">Marie Lloyd</a>, the music-hall star from east London <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQFEI8Y-q4Y\" title=\"\">who was celebrated for singing favourites</a> such as The Boy I Love Is Up in the Gallery and My Old Man (Said Follow the Van), as well as for her saucy use of innuendo. Lloyd died a few days after collapsing on stage at the Alhambra theatre, Leicester Square, in 1922. That was just two years after Pearson first saw Balfour perform in the same venue and hired her for his film Nothing Else Matters (1920).</p> <p>In Love, Life and Laughter, Balfour dances and sings Oh! My Sweet Hortense, a popular American song first published in 1921 (\u201cshe ain\u2019t good-lookin\u2019, but she\u2019s got good sense\u201d) to her friends around the piano. In a Dutch print that survives, the song has been switched to Yes, We Have No Bananas \u2013 no doubt due to that song\u2019s massive popularity on its release in 1923. It is a simple change in a silent film, just a matter of changing what is written on the title cards. So, likewise, Dutch audiences were told that the central character was called Squibs rather than Tip-Toes, rather like pretending Daniel Craig is always playing James Bond, no matter what the movie. In a different scene, Tip-Toes takes the young man to a jazz bar, where neon lights sizzle, a dancer performs the Shimmy, and a band plays the night away.</p> <p>Love, Life and Laughter is always poised between two worlds: success and failure, rich and poor, and the traditional and the modern. Just the kind of film that it is most exciting to revisit, with fresh eyes, nearly a century after it was first seen. It is certainly the kind of fairytale ending that Pearson would appreciate for this showcase for his favourite star.</p> <p><em>Love, Life and Laughter (1923)</em><em> is<a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/y22ct92d\" title=\"\"> at the BFI</a> London </em><em>film </em><em>festival on 3 October</em></p>",

She died in 1977, aged 74, and by the turn of the 21st century the reputation of the woman once known as \u201cBritain\u2019s Queen of Happiness\u201d had gradually diminished \u2013 simply because the films she made were hard to see. So what can we expect from Love, Life and Laughter? Balfour\u2019s presence on screen is as magnetic as it is charming; if you have not seen her before, you may be surprised by the energy of her performance. She is constantly in motion, eyes twinkling and limbs snapping: a gamine with get-up-and-go. In this rags-to-riches story, she plays in the working-class mode for which she was most famous, but when she bursts out of that slum to become a star, she can indulge in the elegant 1920s glamour that suited her so well. It is a sentimental film, with a story-within-a-story narrative, and a central motif provided by a balloon-seller who lives in Tip-Toes\u2019s tenement building: \u201cThe \u2019opes of young people is like the air in balloons,\u201d he says. \u201cThe more \u2019ope, the \u2019igher you goes. Too much \u2019ope \u2013 bust!\u201d Tip-Toes becomes a star while the author suffers rejection, but even at the height of her fame she misses him and remembers their promise to meet again. There are still some segments of the film missing \u2013 about 20 minutes over the course of the feature \u2013 mostly, it is thought, dealing with the young man\u2019s story. There are some fascinating intersections of early 20th-century musical culture at play here, too. Pearson\u2019s first inspiration for the film was Marie Lloyd, the music-hall star from east London who was celebrated for singing favourites such as The Boy I Love Is Up in the Gallery and My Old Man (Said Follow the Van), as well as for her saucy use of innuendo. Lloyd died a few days after collapsing on stage at the Alhambra theatre, Leicester Square, in 1922. That was just two years after Pearson first saw Balfour perform in the same venue and hired her for his film Nothing Else Matters (1920). In Love, Life and Laughter, Balfour dances and sings Oh! My Sweet Hortense, a popular American song first published in 1921 (\u201cshe ain\u2019t good-lookin\u2019, but she\u2019s got good sense\u201d) to her friends around the piano. In a Dutch print that survives, the song has been switched to Yes, We Have No Bananas \u2013 no doubt due to that song\u2019s massive popularity on its release in 1923. It is a simple change in a silent film, just a matter of changing what is written on the title cards. So, likewise, Dutch audiences were told that the central character was called Squibs rather than Tip-Toes, rather like pretending Daniel Craig is always playing James Bond, no matter what the movie. In a different scene, Tip-Toes takes the young man to a jazz bar, where neon lights sizzle, a dancer performs the Shimmy, and a band plays the night away. Love, Life and Laughter is always poised between two worlds: success and failure, rich and poor, and the traditional and the modern. Just the kind of film that it is most exciting to revisit, with fresh eyes, nearly a century after it was first seen. It is certainly the kind of fairytale ending that Pearson would appreciate for this showcase for his favourite star. Love, Life and Laughter (1923) is at the BFI London film festival on 3 October",

Over the past decade, its neo-gothic entrance, through which lawyers, litigants, protesters and politicians parade, has become an increasingly recognisable feature of national life.</p> <p>In the aftermath of its devastating ruling declaring the prime minister\u2019s suspension of parliament to be \u201cunlawful\u201d, the role of the UK\u2019s highest court within the state\u2019s unwritten constitution has gained added lustre \u2013 or, for its critics, notoriety.</p> <p>Lady Hale, the court\u2019s straight-talking first female president, who sports sparkling wildlife brooches, has obtained almost celebrity media status.

At the same time, the leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, was alleged to have told colleagues the ruling was a \u201cconstitutional coup\u201d.</p> <p>Is the supreme court, which sits in Westminster directly opposite the Commons and Lords, developing into a more powerful, constitutional court? What might its role become if there were future institutional re-arrangements? And would that require political confirmation hearings for its dozen justices?</p> <p>Despite warnings by the recently retired supreme court justice Jonathan Sumption in the BBC Reith lectures about the dangers of excessive judicial intervention, his former colleagues produced a judgment that upended the political establishment.</p> <p>But the decision of the supreme court, while focusing on a novel circumstance, re-asserted key, traditional legal principles: the primacy of parliament and that no one is above the law.</p> <p>Supreme court justices have not shrunk in the past from sensitive decisions simply because they involve political matters. In 2015, five of them, sitting as the privy council, overturned the introduction of fresh constituency boundaries <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/12/st-kitts-and-nevis-electoral-rule-overturned-by-privy-council\">in the Caribbean nation of St Kitts and Nevis</a> a few days before its general election.</p> <p>The court, through devolution, has also already transformed itself into a form of constitutional court. In 2012, it heard its first case assessing whether <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/guardian-law-blog/2012/nov/28/supreme-court-constitutional-welsh-byelaws\">Welsh assembly legislation was compatible with UK law</a>.</p> <p>Lord Reed, who becomes the next president of the supreme court in January, accepted in a speech this year that <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.uk/docs/speech-190306.pdf\">its existing role makes it a constitutional court</a>. \u201cIt is \u2026 the final court of appeal in relation to other devolution issues, questions of EU law, questions of human rights and other questions of a constitutional character,\u201d he said. \u201cThis makes it effectively the constitutional court of the United Kingdom.\u201d</p> <p>Calls for US-style confirmation hearings for supreme court justices were considered and rejected by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/mar/28/select-committee-seeks-diverse-judiciary\">the Lords constitution select committee in 2012</a> on the grounds that it would undermine their independence. \u201cPolitical considerations would undoubtedly influence both the parliamentarians chosen to sit on the panels and the questions put to candidates,\u201d the report said.</p> <p>Moving the UK\u2019s most senior judges out of the House of Lords into their own supreme court building in October 2009 was intended to demonstrate their independence and the clear separation of judicial and political powers.</p> <p>With heightened visibility, however, has come greater danger. On Tuesday, when Hale delivered judgment, for the first time the building\u2019s security officer was standing up and scanning the back of the court for potential disruptions. Gina Miller, the victorious legal campaigner, was escorted to hearings by two burly personal guards.</p> <p>Prof Vernon Bogdanor of King\u2019s College London told the Guardian: \u201cThe [prorogation] decision by the supreme court is politically and constitutionally significant, but it\u2019s not a huge jump and won\u2019t turn us into countries like the United States or Germany, where they have constitutional courts that can strike down legislation. Our courts are already, in effect, constitutional courts that enforce EU law.</p> <p>\u201c\u2026 Brexit will leave a gap in our constitution in terms of the protection of human rights. This gap could well be filled by the judges. If that happens, Brexit will increase the danger of a clash between the judges and parliament.\u201d</p> <p>Robert Hazell, professor of government and the constitution at University College London, said: \u201cThe court has come a long way in the past 10 years. It has plugged a gap [in the UK\u2019s unwritten constitution]: it would be a brave prime minister in future who sought an excessively long prorogation.

      "bodyText": "Next Tuesday, 1 October, marks the 10th anniversary of the supreme court. Over the past decade, its neo-gothic entrance, through which lawyers, litigants, protesters and politicians parade, has become an increasingly recognisable feature of national life. In the aftermath of its devastating ruling declaring the prime minister\u2019s suspension of parliament to be \u201cunlawful\u201d, the role of the UK\u2019s highest court within the state\u2019s unwritten constitution has gained added lustre \u2013 or, for its critics, notoriety. Lady Hale, the court\u2019s straight-talking first female president, who sports sparkling wildlife brooches, has obtained almost celebrity media status. She is the heroine of a children\u2019s book, Judge Brenda and the Supreme Court, to be published next month. The enhanced prominence of the court, partially a product of the protracted Brexit crisis, comes amid calls for far-reaching reform of the country\u2019s governing institutions, political selection of judges, renewed interest in proportional representation and questions over the role of referendums. Addressing lawyers earlier this month, John Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons, proposed a royal commission or Speaker\u2019s conference to explore the \u201cdesirability of a written constitution for the UK\u201d in order to resist \u201cexecutive malpractices\u201d. On Wednesday, the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox QC, warned MPs \u201cthere may very well need to be parliamentary scrutiny of judicial appointments in some manner\u201d. At the same time, the leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, was alleged to have told colleagues the ruling was a \u201cconstitutional coup\u201d. Is the supreme court, which sits in Westminster directly opposite the Commons and Lords, developing into a more powerful, constitutional court? What might its role become if there were future institutional re-arrangements? And would that require political confirmation hearings for its dozen justices? Despite warnings by the recently retired supreme court justice Jonathan Sumption in the BBC Reith lectures about the dangers of excessive judicial intervention, his former colleagues produced a judgment that upended the political establishment. But the decision of the supreme court, while focusing on a novel circumstance, re-asserted key, traditional legal principles: the primacy of parliament and that no one is above the law. Supreme court justices have not shrunk in the past from sensitive decisions simply because they involve political matters. In 2015, five of them, sitting as the privy council, overturned the introduction of fresh constituency boundaries in the Caribbean nation of St Kitts and Nevis a few days before its general election. The court, through devolution, has also already transformed itself into a form of constitutional court. In 2012, it heard its first case assessing whether Welsh assembly legislation was compatible with UK law. Lord Reed, who becomes the next president of the supreme court in January, accepted in a speech this year that its existing role makes it a constitutional court. \u201cIt is \u2026 the final court of appeal in relation to other devolution issues, questions of EU law, questions of human rights and other questions of a constitutional character,\u201d he said. \u201cThis makes it effectively the constitutional court of the United Kingdom.\u201d Calls for US-style confirmation hearings for supreme court justices were considered and rejected by the Lords constitution select committee in 2012 on the grounds that it would undermine their independence. \u201cPolitical considerations would undoubtedly influence both the parliamentarians chosen to sit on the panels and the questions put to candidates,\u201d the report said. Moving the UK\u2019s most senior judges out of the House of Lords into their own supreme court building in October 2009 was intended to demonstrate their independence and the clear separation of judicial and political powers. With heightened visibility, however, has come greater danger. On Tuesday, when Hale delivered judgment, for the first time the building\u2019s security officer was standing up and scanning the back of the court for potential disruptions. Gina Miller, the victorious legal campaigner, was escorted to hearings by two burly personal guards. Prof Vernon Bogdanor of King\u2019s College London told the Guardian: \u201cThe [prorogation] decision by the supreme court is politically and constitutionally significant, but it\u2019s not a huge jump and won\u2019t turn us into countries like the United States or Germany, where they have constitutional courts that can strike down legislation. Our courts are already, in effect, constitutional courts that enforce EU law. \u201c\u2026 Brexit will leave a gap in our constitution in terms of the protection of human rights. This gap could well be filled by the judges. If that happens, Brexit will increase the danger of a clash between the judges and parliament.\u201d Robert Hazell, professor of government and the constitution at University College London, said: \u201cThe court has come a long way in the past 10 years. It has plugged a gap [in the UK\u2019s unwritten constitution]: it would be a brave prime minister in future who sought an excessively long prorogation. The court has set boundaries around that area.\u201d The real problem Brexit exposed, he added, was \u201cwhat is the place of referendums in our system\u201d? Assessing the significance of the prorogation ruling, Mark Elliott, professor of public law at Cambridge University, concluded: \u201cThe various factors that are at work in this judgment paint a picture of a supreme court judiciary that is prepared to serve as a guardian of constitutional principle in a way and to an extent that previous generations of apex court judges in the UK were not.\u201d On 16 October, the supreme court will hold an open day to celebrate its 10th anniversary. Anyone will be able to explore the architectural splendour of its courtrooms and its colourful, swirling carpets \u2013 incorporating a Welsh leek, English rose, Scottish thistle and Northern Irish flax \u2013 designed by the artist Sir Peter Blake. The justices hope the the public will be appreciative. \u2022 This article was corrected on 27 September 2019 to remove a description of the entrance to the supreme court as a \u201cportico\u201d (a colonnaded porch).",

      "bodyText": "Egyptian authorities have made it clear that they intend to use force to quell Friday\u2019s planned demonstrations against the rule of the president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi. Public dissent has been all but extinguished under the former army general, who swept to power in a military coup in 2013, making any form of protest extremely dangerous. More than 1,900 people have been arrested since rare protests broke out last weekend, and on Thursday the ministry of the interior \u201caffirmed that it will confront any attempt to destabilise the country with decisiveness\u201d, according to local media. Central Cairo was heavily guarded as riot police, vans of security officials and plainclothes police spread out along the network of streets surrounding Tahrir Square, the epicentre of Egypt\u2019s 2011 revolution. The figures for the arrests were compiled by the Cairo-based NGO the Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights. Bystanders and others who had little to do with the protests were reportedly detained along with the demonstrators, and those arrested were being held across the country. Several prominent opposition figures have been detained, despite no indication that any were involved with the new wave of dissent. The award-winning human rights lawyer Mahienour el-Massry was seized outside a Cairo courthouse where she was defending protesters. Days later, journalist and opposition politician Khaled Dawoud was arrested, as well as the political scientist Hassan Nafea and Hazem Hosny, a former spokesperson for the former military chief of staff Sami Anan, who remains in detention after attempting to run for president last year. Exiled former contractor Mohamed Ali, whose videos alleging rampant corruption within the Egyptian military sparked the recent protests, has called for a million people to march on Friday. It was unclear on Thursday whether the use of teargas, rubber bullets, beatings and live ammunition against those who took to the streets last weekend has discouraged would-be protesters from heeding that call. Tahrir Square resembled a fortress on Thursday. Blue-and-white Egyptian police vans equipped with GPS-tracking technology sat at the entrance to nearby bridges. Across central Cairo, police stopped and searched pedestrians, sometimes seizing their phones to search for political content. People living in the surrounding neighbourhoods worried about raids on their homes. Despite the risks, some were determined to protest. \u201cI will go down and participate, because it can not get worse than the current situation. We are not worth anything in this country,\u201d said Fatma, a teacher from the Egyptian coastal city of Alexandria. An information battle raged online and on the airwaves. The Egyptian authorities struggled to maintain the image of business as usual, while pro-government outlets derided videos of the protests as fake. Meanwhile the web-monitoring organisation NetBlocks reported that Egypt\u2019s internet was experiencing increasing restrictions, including disruption to Twitter, Facebook messenger and Skype. Egypt\u2019s media regulator said the BBC was \u201clikely blocked,\u201d due to its \u201cinaccurate coverage\u201d, of the protests. Sisi has repeatedly made it clear that he won\u2019t tolerate any dissent. Ahmed Mohy, a lone protester who publicly held a sign in Tahrir Square demanding that Sisi step down, was arrested in March and is yet to be released. Twenty-one people were arrested last May and later imprisoned on terrorism charges for protesting against a fare rise on the Cairo metro. There are an estimated 60,000 political prisoners in Egypt. The Egyptian leader blamed \u201cpolitical Islam\u201d, for the protests during a trip to the UN general assembly this week, a reference to the banned Muslim Brotherhood group. The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, praised Sisi during a bilateral meeting in New York, mentioning only \u201cpositive progress in our bilateral relationship\u201d, and ignoring the crackdown back home. The US president, Donald Trump, who has called Sisi his \u201cfavourite dictator\u201d, dismissed the protests in Egypt. \u201cEverybody has demonstrations,\u201d he said. Egyptians\u2019 living conditions have progressively worsened while the risks of speaking out have grown. An estimated 32.5 million people live below the poverty line according to the government\u2019s own figures published in July. Citizens have weathered years of harsh austerity measures including deep subsidy cuts and price increases for basic goods. Yet despite widespread discontent, many were troubled by fears that renewed protests could bring unrest and further destabilise the economy, or create a fresh wave of repression that threatens to ensnare even more of the population. \u201cI never went to a protest, and I will never go.

WE HAVE TO GO BACK.\u201d With this compilation of quite boring words the greatest cliffhanger of all time \u2013 and by \u2018<em>time</em>\u2019 I mean Lost time \u2013 dropped. A cliffhanger so game-changing that one wonders, in the grand brain-fogging tradition of Lost, if it was a cliffhanger at all. Can it be if it offers us a ladder instead of dangling us off a precipice? Except the ladder is unstable. And it\u2019s been hung by a thread-spinning mercenary called Jacob we won\u2019t see for another three seasons. And the cliff rises from an island that might not be real.</p> <p>In this flawless finale, the cliffhanger is set up from the start. Jack, who will unleash those mindblowing words, is on a plane. Drunk, depressed and most disturbingly of all for this most clean-shaven of doctors, <em>bearded</em>. He sees a newspaper clipping announcing someone\u2019s death. His response? To try and kill himself. Here is your classic cliffhanger: who\u2019s the dead guy? The person in the still unopened coffin that near the end we see Jack weeping and popping pills over at a funeral parlour called Hoffs/Drawlar. Which, keep up, is an anagram for \u2018flash forward\u2019.</p> <p>And so we are dragged, Black Smoke style, to the <em>real</em> cliffhanger. That earth-shattering lament in the dark, to a creepily preened Kate, lit by the underbellies of overhead planes descending into LAX. None of this is happening in the past, as we foolishly assumed from all our past experience of TV, nay, life. It is the <em>future</em>. The place beyond the cliffhanger. What is there to do but fall off the sofa. Grab our phones on the way down.

Out of the dark emerged a schizophrenic patient named Paul, slicing Carter in the side and leaving him for dead on the floor. But the real sucker punch, and the moment still seared into my mind after all these years, comes when Carter gazes under the gurney to see beloved med student Lucy, blood everywhere and cheek pressed into the floor, gasping what is surely her last. Such was this show\u2019s audacious genius that we had to wait four \u2013 FOUR \u2013 agonising minutes into the next episode until Dr Weaver found the bloody footprint outside the door and discovered the pair. <em>Kate Abbott</em></p> <h2>The best love letter of all time</h2> <p><strong>My So-Called Life finale</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94YXaLKM3Ig\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/94YXaLKM3Ig?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>No teen show ended on as great a cliffhanger as In Dreams Begin Responsibilities, the still heavily debated finale of My So-Called Life. Earnest young Angela Chase (Claire Danes) suddenly found her dreams answered when Jordan Catalano (Jared Leto) decided the way to win back her heart was via the best love letter of all time. The catch? Viewers knew the letter was written not by Jordan but, Cyrano de Bergerac style, by the nerdy Brian Krakow (Devon Gummersall) who had long nursed an unrequited crush on Angela. The show\u2019s final scene, in which Brian told Angela he wrote the letter just as she got into Jordan\u2019s car, left fans desperate to know what happened next. Would Angela have got bored of the gorgeous but monosyllabic Jordan? Would she have chosen the smart but overkeen Brian? My So-Called Life\u2019s premature cancellation meant we never uncovered the truth, although creator Winnie Holzman recently hinted that Angela would have stuck with Jordan \u2026 at least at first. <em>Sarah Hughes</em></p> <h2>\u2018Yes I am!\u2019</h2> <p><strong>EastEnders \u2013 Kat and Zoe Slater</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgUf9hlTnnU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qgUf9hlTnnU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The year is 2001.

Barry sprints to stop the revelation, but it\u2019s too late. Winkler sees the body. Root pulls out a gun and holds it to Winkler\u2019s head.

That said, the most famous end-of-episode shocker in the show\u2019s history \u2013 the assassination of Teri Bauer by the coward Nina Myers \u2013 wasn\u2019t a cliffhanger at all: we knew Teri was dead, and who killed her, by the time that digital clock stopped clicking. Instead, let\u2019s go for moment at the end of a season three episode where Jack stood over a prone Tony Almeida, leaking claret after being shot in the neck by some criminal goon.

Season three finished with Jesse Pinkman pulling the trigger of a gun. But was the pleading chemist, Gale, on the end of a bullet? We had to wait a year to find out. Then there was the final scene in season five\u2019s Gliding All Over, when DEA man Hank worked out his brother-in-law was a master criminal, but was unable to confront him because he was sitting on the toilet. But the biggest one of all came in the scarifying final half-season and the end of To\u2019Hajiilee. The game is finally up for Walter White, but not only him. He has taken out a hit on his partner Jesse, and the pair have been arrested by Hank in the New Mexico desert. As with so many of Walter\u2019s plans, we see it fall apart, but this time with consequences far greater than ever before. Walt thinks he has called off Jesse\u2019s neo-Nazi assassins, but they ignore his instructions and arrive in the desert in the final seconds. A stand-off ensues with Walt and Jesse in two separate cars, while Hank and his partner Gomez are standing outside. Hank draws his weapon. So do the Nazis. There is silence, then an endless stream of bullets, smashing through metal and glass and, surely, flesh? The camera cuts from one point of view to the next, then jerks like it is being shot itself. You are left in no doubt that this will not end well. You can\u2019t watch any more but you must find out what happens.

But was the pleading chemist, Gale, on the end of a bullet? We had to wait a year to find out. Then there was the final scene in season five\u2019s Gliding All Over, when DEA man Hank worked out his brother-in-law was a master criminal, but was unable to confront him because he was sitting on the toilet. But the biggest one of all came in the scarifying final half-season and the end of To\u2019Hajiilee. The game is finally up for Walter White, but not only him. He has taken out a hit on his partner Jesse, and the pair have been arrested by Hank in the New Mexico desert. As with so many of Walter\u2019s plans, we see it fall apart, but this time with consequences far greater than ever before. Walt thinks he has called off Jesse\u2019s neo-Nazi assassins, but they ignore his instructions and arrive in the desert in the final seconds. A stand-off ensues with Walt and Jesse in two separate cars, while Hank and his partner Gomez are standing outside. Hank draws his weapon. So do the Nazis. There is silence, then an endless stream of bullets, smashing through metal and glass and, surely, flesh? The camera cuts from one point of view to the next, then jerks like it is being shot itself. You are left in no doubt that this will not end well. You can\u2019t watch any more but you must find out what happens. And then, suddenly, the screen cuts to black.

The build-up has been rather rum, with Jones predicting that his side\u2019s opponents will play like \u201c15 Donald Trumps\u201d, an assertion that totally bewildered his opposite number, Gary Gold. \u201cAt this stage, with all due respect, we\u2019re not a good enough rugby team to be making comments or answers to questions like that,\u201d Gold said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it means.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>Though the turnaround from the 35-3 victory over Tonga has been brief, this has been an accommodatingly scheduled pool stage for England, who are given a second game to gently warm themselves into proceedings before forthcoming, and more helpfully-spaced, games against Argentina and France. Though the personnel have changed, they will want to put on a more convincing performance than in their opener, and ideally another bonus point against a nation that has won one game \u2013 against Russia in 2011 \u2013 out of 12 in their last three World Cups.</p> \n  <p>Here are the teams:<strong> <br></strong></p> \n  <p><strong>England:</strong> Elliot Daly, Ruaridh McConnochie, Jonathan Joseph, Piers Francis, Joe Cokanasiga, George Ford (captain), Willi Heinz; Billy Vunipola, Lewis Ludlam, Tom Curry, George Kruis, Joe Launchbury, Dan Cole, Luke Cowan-Dickie, Joe Marler. <br><strong>Reserves: </strong>Jack Singleton, Ellis Genge, Kyle Sinckler, Courtney Lawes, Mark Wilson, Ben Youngs, Owen Farrell, Anthony Watson.</p> \n  <p><strong>United States:</strong> Will Hooley, Blaine Scully (captain), Marcel Brache, Paul Lasike, Martin Iosefo, AJ MacGinty, Shaun Davies; Cam Dolan, John Quill, Tony Lamborn, Nick Civetta, Ben Landry, Titi Lamositele, Joe Taufete\u2019e, David Ainu\u2019u. <br></p> \n  <p><strong>Reserves: </strong>Dylan Fawsitt, Olive Kilifi, Paul Mullen, Greg Peterson, Hanco Germishuys, Ruben de Haas, Bryce Campbell, Mike Te\u2019o. </p> \n  <p>And here\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/25/england-usa-rugby-world-cup\">Rob Kitson\u2019s match preview</a>.

      "bodyText": "And with that, I\u2019m gone. Those were 78 impressive minutes from England, who bestride the Pool C table like a sporting colossus, albeit one that has played a game more than anyone else. Anyway, here\u2019s that table for you, and all the other information you could possibly want or need. Bye! Eddie Jones talks to ITV: Well, two games and 10 points. No major injuries, I think Owen\u2019s got half his nose missing but apart from that we\u2019re pretty good. I think we\u2019re getting used to the conditions. It was 27 degrees, 70% humidity, the ball was like a cake of soap. We wanted 10 points after two games, so we\u2019re perfect. On Lewis Ludlam\u2019s performances: Look, he\u2019s an incredible young player and he\u2019s only going to get better. He was luck to make Northampton\u2019s B team 12 months ago and he\u2019s out there playing in a World Cup and one of the most impressive young forwards out there. And on their next game, against Argentina next Saturday: We\u2019ve got two or three days off, a nice break, then it\u2019s a one-off game against Argentina. They\u2019re playing for their life and we\u2019re playing to beat Argentina, so it\u2019s going to be a great game. Here\u2019s Jonny Wilkinson on those madcap final moments, when having got nowhere near the England tryline for 79 minutes the USA suddenly got two near-misses and a try: That ball looked impossible to hold at the end. No one could pass it, no one could carry it. Those are great players out there who know what they\u2019re doing with their skill, and if they\u2019re struggling it\u2019s for a reason. Here\u2019s Robert Kitson\u2019s match report from Kobe: No American dreams here, just a painful 80-minute nightmare. Eddie Jones\u2019s England were supposed to be footsore and weary only 96 hours after their opening game against Tonga but instead their forwards had far too much in the tank for their outclassed opponents en route to their second convincing pool win of this Rugby World Cup. England\u2019s eventual seven-try victory was also notable for the tournament\u2019s first red card, shown to US flanker John Quill for a blatant shoulder charge to Owen Farrell\u2019s head. Quill could have no argument at all about the decision but, with England already 38 points up, it had no effect on the outcome. Much more here: George Ford says a few words. I do mean a few: It\u2019s a good win again. We had to work for it, USA are a very physical, passionate team. We had to earn that win and I thought we did that very well. 84 mins: And that\u2019s the final action! 82 mins: They get their try! It\u2019s all a horrible mess. England give the ball away two yards off their line, and this chance the USA can\u2019t fluff! Bryce Campbell goes over the line! 81 mins: And another go! De Haas runs forward! He jinks left! He jinks right! He attracts the last two defenders! He totally fluffs his pass to Kermishuys! 80 mins: Suddenly the USA roar forward! They pick the ball up from a ruck and pass right to Te\u2019o, who streaks through the entire England team with very little opposition and looks to pass inside to Ruben de Haas, who has nothing but green grass in front of him, but it\u2019s fumbled! 79 mins: England work the ball from left to right, where Kyle Sinckler bursts through the defensive line and is so excited by this development that he drops the ball. 78 mins: Three minutes from the end, as three minutes from the beginning, the USA are forced into a change. Will Hooley is off with what looks a potentially serious injury, and Iosefo is back on. 79 mins: The game is still stopped. George Ford is named player of the match, and will be receiving a freshly-engraved trophy in a few minutes. 78 mins: England run forward again, when suddenly the whistle blows! The referee explains that he had an urgent call to stop, with a USA player on the ground. 77 mins: The ball is quickly worked to Cokanasiga, who with half the USA defence either busy stopping Genge or lying scattered around the field in his wake is able to streak through! 76 mins: Genge emerges from a maul and sets off downfield. He steamrollers one tackle, bulldozes through another and suddenly England are on the attack! Meanwhile, Anya Revens is in Kobe: \u201cShout out to the England fans at the back of our stand in Kobe. Despite the brutal heat &amp; humidity they\u2019ve kept us going with many rounds of Swing Low, Country roads, Sweet Caroline &amp; they\u2019ve now bravely embarked on Bohemian Rhapsody! Fantastic atmosphere. And unsurprisingly a lot of booing for the tackle on Farrell.\u201d 74 mins: England give a brief exhibition of the art of fumbling and loose passing. To be fair, the ball and every hand that is laid upon it have to be extremely sweaty by now. Somehow they get away with it, and the USA get no more than a scrum. 71 mins: So finally the tournament has its first red card, and it couldn\u2019t have been much clearer. Then Farrell\u2019s fantastic kick nearly releases Cokanasiga, but as he slides along the ground to collect it he fails to do so cleanly and it bounces off him, a few yards from the line. The weighting of that kick, though, was just fantastic. 70 mins: That was nasty. Quill hits Farrell, his shoulder making clear and violent contact with the England player\u2019s head. 70 mins: Handbags! England get the ball, Farrell fumbles, but he finally gets the ball in hand, rises with it and is clobbered by John Quill, who will surely get a red card for it! In the meantime, there\u2019s an angry coming-together involving most of the players on the pitch. 70 mins: Mark Wilson drops the ball from the kick-off, and the USA threaten for the first time today! 69 mins: No problem there for Ford. 68 mins: The gap is becoming a chasm now, and there\u2019s an enormous void on the right side of the USA defence as England work the ball wide and end up with four players marching untracked to the tryline, with Lewis Ludlum doing the honours! 66 mins: Joseph goes on another lovely, twisty, quicksilver run down the right, but his kick infield at the end of it is just too long for Ford. 65 mins: England seem to be getting quicker, though it may simply be comparative. 62 mins: England threaten again, but just as George Ford\u2019s last conversion sailed between the posts, his last pass sailed between his team-mates. 61 mins: A load more changes. There are people with clean, sweat-free shirts all over the place now. 60 mins: This conversion was harder still, but Ford gets his aiming perfect this time and it sails between the posts! 59 mins: A quick tap-penalty and England have the USA scrambling and failing to organising their defence. Eventually the ball goes wide to the right, where McConnochie collects and goes over! 57 mins: They\u2019re still scrummaging, after a couple of collapses. 54 mins: England threaten again, only for Sinckler to knock on. It\u2019ll be a USA scrum. 50 mins: A few more England changes: Ben Youngs, Owen Farrell and Courtney Lawes come on, Heinz, Francis and Launchbury go off. 49 mins: Ford misses another conversion attempt, this from wide on the right and his hardest of the night by a margin. 48 mins: A lovely run from Joseph, whose spin takes him past a couple of opponents and who then sprints towards the tryline. He\u2019s finally stopped just a couple of yards short, and the ball is popped straight to Cokanasiga, who goes over! 47 mins: A much improved couple of minutes for the USA, but it ends with them clinging onto the ball when it\u2019s on the floor, and an England penalty. 44 mins: At the end of all that Ford goes for touch but fluffs his kick, which crosses the tryline before the byline and the USA get to clear. 43 mins: It ends with a high tackle on Launchbury, and a delay while the US bring on Paul Mullen for Lamositele, and Mike Te\u2019o for Hooley. 42 mins: England have completely dominated since the restart. They work the ball from right to left, back to the right, and back to the left again. 41 mins: And the second half is under way! Three half-time changes for England. Ellis Genge is on for Marler, Kyle Sinckler on for Cole, and Mark Wilson for Vunipola. And here\u2019s this week\u2019s Breakdown, from Paul Rees in Kobe: The way Japan has embraced the World Cup and a sport that otherwise attracts little attention is visible wherever a match is staged. The manager at a hotel in Toyota on Monday, bedecked in the kit of the host nation, admitted he knew nothing about the oval code but felt he had a duty to support the event. And so that night the streets of downtown Toyota were crowded with locals wearing Wales jerseys and supporting them against Georgia with the same fervour of those who have travelled nearly 6,000 miles to follow the team. \u201cIt is a matter of national pride,\u201d said the manager, who admitted he would be following next year\u2019s Olympics in Tokyo far more closely than the rugby. \u201cWe want people to think well of Japan.\u201d Much more here: A competent, if not overwhelming, first-half performance from England, who are on course for the victory and the bonus point they wanted, and until the last minute there had been very few handling errors to moan about. Here\u2019s some half-time reading for you: A report on Italy 48-7 Canada: A Japan v Ireland preview: England threaten a fourth first-half try soon after the gong sounds. Daly kicks over the top of the USA defence, Joseph bursts on to it and passes to Cokanasiga, and with a try looking increasingly likely he knocks it on! The whistle blows, and that\u2019s half-time! 40 mins: Ford kicks crossfield right to left towards Cokanasiga, but as he jumps to catch it Hooley comes from nowhere, getting nowhere near the ball, and does a flying shoulder-barge. It\u2019s not terribly violent or dangerous, but there was no control there at all. 39 mins: Daly\u2019s blind pass, from tight on the right touchline, bounces up and is collected by Tony Lamborn, who unaccountably fumbles! He beats the turf in frustration, and it\u2019ll be another scrum. 33 mins: Another try, and it\u2019s a repeat of the second! This time the line-out is on the right rather than the left, and a bit further from the tryline, but England just steamroller through their opponents and in the end Cowan-Dickie touches down! Ford\u2019s attempted conversion, with several USA players closing down, hits the post and rebounds away! 32 mins: Another penalty, from another scrum, and another kick into touch from George Ford. 30 mins: A lovely kick from AJ MacGinty finds Scully on the left touchline, and for the first time the USA are putting pressure on England. 26 mins: Ford\u2019s kick sails between the posts, and England further extend their lead! That was a little too easy, but though England haven\u2019t been particularly convincing with the ball, they have kept it in the USA half for almost the entire game and that kind of pressure is going to tell. 25 mins: And they get a try! From the line-out England drive the ball over the line and Vinipola touches down! 24 mins: England win a penalty, right in front of the posts and within easy kicking range. Again, they go for the corner. England don\u2019t want easy points, they want tries. 23 mins: England gain 15 yards in the maul, Cowan-Dickie hanging off its back with the ball in his hands and just walking forwards. 20 mins: Marcel Brache hits Launchbury with a fine tackle that spins the Englishman and sends the ball skewing out of his arms. 19 mins: A long spell of England pressure ends with a USA scrum. 18 mins: Another England penalty, and again it\u2019s kicked to a corner. From the line-out, they go from left to right but the USA defence holds up. 14 mins: USA lose the ball on the floor, but then Heinz keeps hold of it on the ground, and the USA get an easy clearance. 12 mins: England get a penalty on the right after Lewis Ludlum gets grabbed by the neck. England kick it to the corner, but don\u2019t capitalise. 11 mins: Ford hoists the ball high into the sky, and as it falls Will Hooley just about keeps it for the USA. It was nearly grabbed by Daly, but in the end the ball bounced off him and it would have been a knock-on had the USA not emerged with it. 9 mins: The teams trade kicks for a bit, ending when Ford finds touch. 6 mins: From the maul the ball is thrown straight to George Ford, who spies a gap in the USA defence and speeds straight through it! He touches down between the posts, and it\u2019s easily converted! 6 mins: England go close! Francis finds some space on the left wing, cuts inside and, as he goes down, tries to lay off to Curry, but it falls behind him, bounces, and Launchbury is then held at bay. 3 mins: Ainuu limps from the field, arms draped across the shoulders of a couple of team-mates. Olive Kilifi replaces him. 3 mins: David Ainuu, the loosehead prop, has not got back up after that scrum, and is gingerly feeling his left cankle/calf area. 3 mins: The first scrum ends with Willi Heinz tackling Shaun Davies before he\u2019s picked up the ball, and thus a US penalty. 2 mins: England work the ball from left to right, but a final long pass to Cokanasiga is not the best, and forces him to turn back. 1 min: And they\u2019re off! Ready for action! England, wearing red, will get the game started. \u201cDoes playing like 15 Donald Trumps involve making a terrible mess of everything but getting away with it if the opposition is incompetent and the TMO is Russian?\u201d wonders James. That may very well be England\u2019s cunning plan but according to Eddie Jones it\u2019s the USA who will play like 15 Trumps. Perhaps it simply means being confident, committing fully to your gameplan and being at all times in complete denial of your own failings? The players are out, and the national anthems being played! Eddie Jones has had a pre-match chat with ITV: It\u2019s a marathon. The World Cup\u2019s a marathon. We\u2019re looking for a measured performance tonight. We know the USA are going to play with a lot of pride and passion, but we might have a little bit more pace in our side tonight. On his much-changed team: I think more and more the World Cup\u2019s about a squad of 31. We\u2019re seeing sides losing players already and we know the game\u2019s getting more and more physical, so the ability to have a squad that\u2019s in tune, in form and competing against each other, and then being able to put out a competitive 23, is going to be so important. And on the swift turnaround and conditions in Kobe: We haven\u2019t done much training but we had a run-out in here yesterday and it was a little bit sweaty. It\u2019s a test of your ability to focus and do the simple things well. Here\u2019s a bit more on the Player of the Match trophy. I am more befuddled than ever: The hardware features a sculptural origami design, inspired by the work of Professor Jun Mitani, and will be finished live on the ground with in-the-moment laser etching reflecting highlights from the match. Monitoring fan activity on social media through a bespoke API \u2013 combined with commentary from the official worldfeed RWC 2019\u2122 \u2013 Mastercard will select the top moments of each match to be immortalised on the trophy. This unique storymaking approach enables players to take home a first-of-its-kind, truly priceless account of the match, so they can re-live moments of passion, excitement and sporting greatness. Throughout the World Cup they are laser-etching quotes from the official commentary onto the player of the match trophies. Why is this happening? What\u2019s the point? Really, I find the whole business very confusing. \u201cI\u2019m not a gambling man, but could you point me toward somewhere that I can lay a significant amount of money to wager that this will be an unnecessarily turgid affair strewn with enough handling errors that there\u2019s a decent chance Brian Moore may explode?\u201d pleads Ant Pease. \u201cAdmittedly, it\u2019s a niche bet, but I reckon it\u2019s surefire money.\u201d Oh you terrible cynic you. It is \u201cincredibly humid\u201d, say ITV from the stadium. On the plus side, Ben Kay says the playing surface is \u201cmagical\u201d. A bit more pre-match reading: According to the World Cup\u2019s official website, the Kobe Misaki Stadium is a \u201cpurpose-built rectangular stadium\u201d. I think this undersells it somewhat. For a start, from outside it\u2019s barely even rectangular. The roof is closed tonight, and it is apparently pretty steamy in there though the temperature outside is a perfectly reasonable 26C. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going on here, but it looks extremely suspicious. Here\u2019s a bit by Will Hooley, the USA\u2019s England-born, Bedford-based back who is writing for us throughout the World Cup: Join Niall McVeigh to see how Italy got on against Canada: England\u2019s second game of the World Cup sees Eddie Jones make 10 changes to face the USA, who are playing their first game of the tournament. The build-up has been rather rum, with Jones predicting that his side\u2019s opponents will play like \u201c15 Donald Trumps\u201d, an assertion that totally bewildered his opposite number, Gary Gold. \u201cAt this stage, with all due respect, we\u2019re not a good enough rugby team to be making comments or answers to questions like that,\u201d Gold said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it means.\u201d Though the turnaround from the 35-3 victory over Tonga has been brief, this has been an accommodatingly scheduled pool stage for England, who are given a second game to gently warm themselves into proceedings before forthcoming, and more helpfully-spaced, games against Argentina and France. Though the personnel have changed, they will want to put on a more convincing performance than in their opener, and ideally another bonus point against a nation that has won one game \u2013 against Russia in 2011 \u2013 out of 12 in their last three World Cups. Here are the teams: England: Elliot Daly, Ruaridh McConnochie, Jonathan Joseph, Piers Francis, Joe Cokanasiga, George Ford (captain), Willi Heinz; Billy Vunipola, Lewis Ludlam, Tom Curry, George Kruis, Joe Launchbury, Dan Cole, Luke Cowan-Dickie, Joe Marler. Reserves: Jack Singleton, Ellis Genge, Kyle Sinckler, Courtney Lawes, Mark Wilson, Ben Youngs, Owen Farrell, Anthony Watson. United States: Will Hooley, Blaine Scully (captain), Marcel Brache, Paul Lasike, Martin Iosefo, AJ MacGinty, Shaun Davies; Cam Dolan, John Quill, Tony Lamborn, Nick Civetta, Ben Landry, Titi Lamositele, Joe Taufete\u2019e, David Ainu\u2019u. Reserves: Dylan Fawsitt, Olive Kilifi, Paul Mullen, Greg Peterson, Hanco Germishuys, Ruben de Haas, Bryce Campbell, Mike Te\u2019o. And here\u2019s Rob Kitson\u2019s match preview. And also, finally, welcome: Kick-off: 11.45am BST, 6.45am EDT, 7.45pm local in Kobe.",

No parent should be in any doubt of the devastating impact of these diseases.

      "bodyText": "Experts have expressed alarm at the drop in take-up of all routine childhood vaccinations across England, with a marked decline in rates against 13 different diseases, which leaves many thousands of children under-protected. The UK recently lost its measles-free status because of the fall in rates of MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) immunisation. But the latest figures from NHS Digital for England in the year to the end of March 2019 show a loss of confidence for vaccinations more generally. At the ages of 12 months, 24 months and five years there has been a marked decline in vaccination rates against 13 different diseases, including whooping cough (pertussis), diphtheria and meningitis. Measles protection is down again \u2013 part of a protracted fall in take-up of the MMR jab that has led to outbreaks across Europe, which have then spread into England. Measles had been officially eradicated in the UK, but the World Health Organization recently withdrew its measles-free status. Coverage of 95% of the population is necessary to prevent outbreaks. Among children aged 24 months, vaccination in England has dropped from 91.2% in 2017-18 to 90.3% in 2018-19. The rate has gone down each year for the last five years. Confidence in the MMR jab appears to have been dropping at least partly in response to social media misinformation and scare stories. The discredited claims of Andrew Wakefield, who in 1998 theorised that the jab was linked to autism, are widely circulated. There are regional differences, with greatest confidence in the north-east, where coverage is 94.5%. London had the lowest MMR vaccination rate in 2018-19 at just 83%, down from 85.1% in 2017-18. The figures show that the drop in trust in vaccines has expanded to affect even the basic immunisation given to babies in their first year of life. Take-up of the five-in-one vaccine against diphtheria, whooping cough (pertussis), tetanus, polio and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), has dropped for the sixth year from 93.1% in 2017-18 to 92.1% in 2018-19. Among children aged 24 months, coverage has dropped below the 95% target for the first time since 2008-09, to 94.2% in the year to March. Other vaccines affected are pneumococcal disease (PCV), rotavirus, meningococcal group B (MenB), Hib booster and meningococcal group C vaccine (Hib/MenC) and children\u2019s flu vaccines. Prof Heidi Larson, who runs the Vaccine Confidence Project at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the figures were concerning. \u201cI would stress this is not just a blip, but has been an incremental but persisting decline over multiple years,\u201d she said. \u201cThe recent loss of the UK\u2019s measles-free elimination status \u2013 along with Albania, Czech Republic and Greece \u2013 should be a wake-up call that this is getting serious.\u201d Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at Public Health England, said significant numbers of children were affected. \u201cAlthough these changes are small proportions, these are big drops in terms of public health. \u201cThe trend is a concerning continuation of what we\u2019ve seen in the last five years. No parent should be in any doubt of the devastating impact of these diseases. It\u2019s vital that everyone recognises the value of vaccines and takes up this life-saving offer.\u201d The health secretary, Matt Hancock, who has expressed interest in mandatory vaccinations for children before they are allowed to go to school, said: \u201cFalling childhood vaccination rates are unacceptable. Everyone has a role to play in halting this decline. \u201cThe loss of our measles-free status is a stark reminder that devastating diseases can, and will, resurface. We need to be bold and I will not rule out action so that every child is properly protected.\u201d Prof Stephen Powis, NHS national medical director, said: \u201cVaccines are a vital, life-saving part of our country\u2019s public health and the numbers of children not being vaccinated is concerning. \u201cNo one should be complacent about getting their own or their child\u2019s jabs and so the NHS is taking action, with its partners, to combat the decline.\u201d Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, said the reasons for the fall in immunisation were complex. \u201cSome of it is down to misinformation of vaccine dangers that still do the circuit on social media, and some communities and groups of people have consistently been difficult to engage with, but I suspect that much of it is down to the fact that we have forgotten just how serious these infections can be, and have started to think of them as simply trivial childhood infections. \u201cWe all lead busy lives and it might be tempting to put off a trip to the GP for convenience\u2019s sake.

      "bodyText": "A Swedish newspaper has announced it will stop taking advertising that promotes fossil fuel-based goods and services with immediate effect. The editor of the daily Dagens ETC said the decision was \u201ccrucial for our credibility\u201d. He urged other media outlets to consider doing the same. The ETC, which launched in 2014, is a daily paper and online newspaper. Its editor-in-chief, Andreas Gustavsson, said the decision was taken by the owner, the board, the marketing department and the 25 editors and reporters on its staff. He said the decision would hit the paper\u2019s finances. \u201cBut I am also convinced that this will prove to be a wise decision in the long term,\u201d said Gustavsson. \u201cI am very aware that the media industry is extremely tough and it is difficult to survive financially. However, the climate crisis affects every single one of us.\u201d He added: \u201cHow far can journalism go when it is bankrolled by forces that have everything to gain from blocking large-scale action to address our climate crisis?\u201d Dagens ETC, based in Stockholm, has about 10,000 daily subscribers and more than 60,000 unique readers a week, according to Gustavsson. Its funding comes from a mixture of reader subscriptions, advertising and the government support offered to papers across Sweden. Gustavsson said the paper\u2019s revenue from advertising amounted to more than 1,000,000 Swedish kronor (\u00a385,000), of which 15-20% had previously been from advertisements they will now decline. The decision comes after the biggest mass climate protest in history took place around the world last Friday, with further demonstrations expected this Friday. The UN climate summit in New York met in an effort to inject urgency into governments\u2019 pledge to restrict the rise in global temperatures to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, as agreed under the 2015 Paris agreement. In May the activist group Extinction Rebellion wrote an open letter to advertisers and agencies urging them to use their powers to tackle the climate emergency. Some agencies responded this summer by setting up the Creatives for Climate movement, pledging to avoid working on fossil fuel briefs.",

A number of BBC presenters and journalists have said they are considering writing to the director general, Tony Hall, to ask for the decision to be reviewed before it causes further damage to the corporation\u2019s public standing, especially among BAME communities. There is particular anger about the ruling given Munchetty\u2019s comments were made in response to questions from Walker, who was asking for her personal experience of racist language.

The clip of Munchetty\u2019s short exchange with Walker briefly went viral in the summer, earning hundreds of thousands of views and remains on BBC Breakfast social media accounts, but had largely been forgotten until the recent ruling. In an updated statement the BBC said Trump\u2019s comments were widely condemned as racist and that Munchetty was perfectly entitled to give her personal response to the president\u2019s words. However, she was found to have breached editorial guidelines because BBC journalists are not allowed to \u201cgive their opinions about the individual making the remarks or their motives for doing so\u201d. Senior journalists privately complain that news executives are struggling with how to handle persistent complaints from rightwing campaigners about the corporation\u2019s perceived leftwing biases, creating the internal perception that bosses are overcompensating following the 2016 Brexit referendum amid an ongoing culture war. At the same time the BBC management is increasingly facing internal clashes with its own journalists who are publicly calling out the corporation when they feel it is falling short on issues relating to diversity \u2013 both internally and on-screen. This then causes clashes over which topics are legitimate topics of discussion for the corporation\u2019s television and radio shows and which are not up for debate. Earlier this year, the BBC reminded staff not to tweet their personal views, after employees publicly objected to BBC programmes hosting discussions that debated the rights and wrongs of teaching children about tolerance for LGBT people.

MPs responded with shouts of outrageous when Jenkin said: \u201cThere is already a danger in these exchanges of it turning into a holier-than-thou competition. \u201cI think we should reflect on how much unhappiness and anxiety there is among members of the house, and that this is going to be expressed in various ways, and people are going to use robust and emotive language in order to express their views, and that is entirely understandable. \u201cCan I just make one request, that we no longer invoke the name of any person who has been the victim of attacks in order to try and make political points.\u201d",

However, the answer to this question alone does not tell us whether Trump should be impeached. The constitutional standard of impeachment \u2013 \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d \u2013 is not a legal one. Rather, an impeachable offense occurs when a president violates the oath to abide by the constitution\u2019s limits and respect its values.

The released transcript clearly shows the chief executive of the United States pressuring a foreign government to criminally investigate his political opponent. That alone is impeachable. To \u201cfaithfully execute\u201d the law, as Article II demands of the president, requires enforcing the law impartially, as a tool for equal justice, not personal gain.

But a president does not need to break the law to commit a high crime.</p> <p>Nor does a successful impeachment require evidence \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d that a high crime was committed. No judge rules on permissible evidence during an impeachment inquiry or trial, nor can the judiciary overturn any eventual ruling.

That would be a mistake \u2013 a missed opportunity to educate the public about Trump\u2019s broader myriad violations of his oath, from his efforts to obstruct justice as detailed in the Mueller report, to profiting from official business hosted at his properties, to equating white supremacists with law-abiding Americans.</p> <p>Declaring these failures of office irrelevant would replicate Congress\u2019s failure in the <a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Impeachment_Johnson.htm\">impeachment of President Andrew Johnson</a> in 1868. Then, Congress resented Johnson\u2019s abject refusal to enforce civil rights legislation after the civil war.

      "body": "<p>A dominant figure in French politics for four decades, Jacques Chirac, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/26/jacques-chirac-former-french-president-dies-aged-86\">who has died</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/26/jacques-chirac-former-french-president-dies-aged-86\"> aged 86</a>, became president of France in 1995 at his third attempt. He was the fifth occupant of the post under the Fifth Republic. Previously he had been mayor of Paris and twice prime minister, yet, when he finally achieved the presidency, he proved to have little vision or particular determination, given the opportunities the voters had at last bestowed on him. He had campaigned on the <em>fracture sociale</em> (social divide) but did little if anything to bridge it. There were some positives, including his conspicuous opposition to the Iraq war, improvements to road safety and reform of military service, but at the end of his 12 years at the Elys\u00e9e Palace (during his time there the presidential term was cut from seven years to five) it was hard to point to major reforms to a society that badly needed them.</p> <p>He appeared to have neither the will nor the imagination to confront France\u2019s problems, including those posed by powerful and immovable vested interests and by the public finances. His career ended under a cloud when, his presidential immunity lifted, a court convicted him of corruption during his years as mayor of Paris \u2013 when, among other things, his staff used public money to employ members of his own political party in bogus jobs. By then frail and suffering from memory problems, he was not in court to hear the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/15/jacques-chirac-guilty-corruption\" title=\"\">two-year suspended sentence</a> imposed on him in 2011.</p> <p>Chirac claimed to be the political heir to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/charles-de-gaulle\" title=\"\">Charles de Gaulle</a>, who created the Fifth Republic, but his positions were so variable and inconsistent that he could have argued he was following in the footsteps of almost any postwar figure. His first presidency was blighted by a self-inflicted wound. Two years after his election, although his conservative allies had a parliamentary majority, he called an unnecessary general election, which the Socialist party and its allies won. There had been other instances of cohabitation (the situation under which the president and the prime minister, and so the government, come from different political families) but they had never lasted for more than two years. Chirac was stuck with the Socialist Lionel Jospin, whom he had defeated for the presidency in 1995, as prime minister for five years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ce644e19a458fe0a4d1aad1a814726b4888c477d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce644e19a458fe0a4d1aad1a814726b4888c477d/38_0_1230_1496/822.jpg\" alt=\"Lionel Jospin, left, and Jacques Chirac listening to a question during a press conference at the end of a French-German summit in Potsdam.\" width=\"822\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lionel Jospin, left, and Jacques Chirac listening to a question during a press conference at the end of a French-German summit in Potsdam.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jan Bauer/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His critics regarded him as an unprincipled and greedy opportunist, skilled in the politician\u2019s arts of clientelism and betrayal but lacking any real conviction and indecisive in government. Even his political enemies, though, found it hard to dislike the affable Chirac, with his gargantuan appetite for Mexican beer and rillettes (pork) sandwiches, and there was little schadenfreude at his conviction. His defenders pointed to his intelligence, energy and adaptability, and to an authentic human warmth and generosity and breadth of culture that 40 years in the political jungle had failed to extinguish. Although he did not match <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-francois-mitterrand-1323110.html\" title=\"\">Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand</a>\u2019s pharaonic works, he leaves at least one monument, the Quai Branly museum in Paris, which is dedicated to the indigenous arts and culture of non-European civilisations.</p> <p>Chirac was capable of acts of great grace, as evidenced by what was perhaps the finest hour of his presidency \u2013 his admission of the responsibility of the French state in the Vichy years of 1940-44, so long and so shamefully denied \u2013 and by his moving and generous tribute to Mitterrand on the latter\u2019s death in 1996. Unlike some of his political allies, he would have no truck with the far-right Front National, though its leader, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/jean-marie-le-pen\" title=\"\">Jean-Marie Le Pen,</a> claimed, not unconvincingly, that Chirac had once asked for his support.</p> <p>However, few impartial observers could fail to conclude that, during his 18 years as mayor of Paris, Chirac was a willing and active participant in a system of corruption that attained heroic proportions. His lack of loyalty was legendary. While he was far from being reflexively anti-American, his dream of a multipolar world led him to cultivate friendships with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin\" title=\"\">Vladimir Putin</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/dec/30/iraq.guardianobituaries\" title=\"\">Saddam Hussein</a> and assorted generous African tyrants.</p> <p>Son of Marie-Louise (nee Valette) and Abel-Fran\u00e7ois, Chirac was born in Paris. His family had rural roots in the central French region of Limousin, and his grandfather had been a teacher in the d\u00e9partement of Corr\u00e8ze. Chirac always nurtured his family\u2019s rural ties; farmers formed part of his natural constituency. Those roots were not, though, especially deep; his father was an aircraft company executive.</p> <p>After a secondary education in Paris, Chirac took one of the elite\u2019s classic fast tracks: Sciences Po (the Institut d\u2019\u00c9tudes Politiques de Paris), followed by the \u00c9cole Nationale d\u2019Administration and the Cour des Comptes. He found time to take a summer course at Harvard. Military service, which he relished, took him to Algeria. He was a cavalry officer and a passionate supporter of <em>\u201cAlg\u00e9rie fran\u00e7aise\u201d</em>.</p> <p>In the early 1960s, the energetic young Chirac caught the eye of Georges Pompidou, De Gaulle\u2019s prime minister. He became a member of Pompidou\u2019s cabinet and something of a protege of the rotund, worldly premier who was in many respects the polar opposite of De Gaulle. It is from this period that his nickname of <em>le bulldozer</em>, a tribute to his inexhaustible energy, is believed to date. Pompidou encouraged the young Chirac to add a political dimension to his technocratic activities, and he was duly elected a local councillor in Sainte-F\u00e9r\u00e9ole, Corr\u00e8ze, in 1965. He won a parliamentary seat in the nearby town of Ussel in 1967 and held it for the next 25 years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ebe4df0f34331c918cee7f1c1aad93a8d25af7f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ebe4df0f34331c918cee7f1c1aad93a8d25af7f2/0_0_2048_1601/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jacques Chirac being welcomed by supporters in Ussel, where he won his first parliamentary seat in 1967.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"782\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jacques Chirac being welcomed by supporters in Ussel, where he won his first parliamentary seat in 1967.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philippe Wojazer/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His government career began when Pompidou made him a junior minister in the social affairs department in 1967. The following year saw the civil unrest of the <em>\u00e9v\u00e9nements</em> of May and June, and Chirac was closely involved in the negotiations that got France back to work; legend has it that on one occasion he attended a critical meeting with a gun concealed on his person. In 1969 De Gaulle resigned after losing an unnecessary referendum, and Pompidou became president. Chirac\u2019s career flourished: middle-rank posts were followed by a spell at the agriculture ministry, where he established himself as the friend and defender of the <em>paysan</em>, and then the interior ministry.</p> <p>In 1974 Pompidou died from a painful and lingering disease that had been hidden from the public. The obvious candidate to succeed him as president was the prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/nov/13/guardianobituaries2\" title=\"\">Jacques Chaban-Delmas</a>, a reformist, resistance hero and authentic Gaullist. In the first of a long series of <em>coups de th\u00e9\u00e2tre</em>, arguing that Chaban-Delmas could not beat Mitterrand, Chirac led a group of 43 Gaullist deputies into the camp of Val\u00e9ry Giscard d\u2019Estaing, champion of the centrists and the free-market, non-Gaullist right. </p> <p>Giscard eliminated Chaban in the first round of voting and narrowly defeated Mitterrand in the second. Chirac was rewarded with the premiership. The relationship did not last long; Giscard had no intention of \u201cinaugurating chrysanthemums\u201d, as De Gaulle once put it, while Chirac ran policy. The president pushed through an ambitious series of social and economic reforms, not all of them to the taste of his political allies, and two years after his appointment Chirac abruptly resigned, claiming he was not being given the means to carry out his task.</p> <p>At the end of 1976 he founded the Rassemblement pour la R\u00e9publique (RPR) \u2013 often described as neo-Gaullist, though the general would probably have been astonished by some of its positions \u2013 transforming the drifting and divided Gaullist movement into a machine to serve the personal ambition that would propel him to the Elys\u00e9e. It also purported to defend Gaullist, nationalist and popular conservative values against the alleged Europhile and liberal policies of Giscard. The following year Chirac achieved another success when he shouldered aside Giscard\u2019s candidate to become mayor of Paris \u2013 the post restored after more than a century in abeyance.</p> <p>With the RPR at his disposal \u2013 over the years he was to beat off attempts by Gaullists more authentic than him to wrest it from him \u2013 and a power base in the Paris city hall, he resumed his trek to the Elys\u00e9e. In 1981 he made his first presidential bid. He was easily beaten by Mitterrand and Giscard in the first round, but the right was split and Chirac endorsed Giscard in the final round with such an obvious lack of enthusiasm that many of his supporters abstained or voted for the left, and Giscard was beaten. Mitterrand called a general election, which was won by the Socialists and their allies.</p> <p>During the next few years the divisions between the Paris city hall and the RPR became increasingly blurred as Chirac pursued his ambitions. In 1986 the swing of the political pendulum brought the right back to power in the national assembly and, for the second time, Chirac became prime minister: this was the first cohabitation. The new premier was no match for the crafty Mitterrand, who easily outmanoeuvred him. In 1988 Mitterrand and Chirac faced each other in the final round of the presidential election and Mitterrand was the easy winner, calling a parliamentary election, which was won by the left.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1615d2a0fa7a3cc6e6e3aedc9c648a905baccbf6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1615d2a0fa7a3cc6e6e3aedc9c648a905baccbf6/0_180_3090_1854/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jacques Chirac and Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand attending a European summit in The Hague.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jacques Chirac and Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand attending a European summit in The Hague.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thierry Orban/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Five years later the right again won a general election. After his experience in the mid-1980s, Chirac had no intention of spending two more years sparring with Mitterrand; his \u201cfriend of 30 years\u201d, the fastidious and aloof \u00c9douard Balladur, was appointed premier instead. It was clearly understood, at least by Chirac, that Balladur was a simple lieutenant and that <em>le grand</em> would step forward when Mitterrand\u2019s second seven-year term ended and new presidential elections took place. It was yet another miscalculation; it took very little time for Balladur to discover that he, too, would like to be president.</p> <p>At the start of 1995, Balladur was well ahead in the opinion polls and many of Chirac\u2019s chief supporters had switched their support to him, including the interior minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/nicolas-sarkozy\" title=\"\">Nicolas Sarkozy</a>, eventually Chirac\u2019s hyperactive successor, whom he came to loathe. But Chirac, a far better and more experienced campaigner, discovered the <em>fracture sociale</em> that had been apparent to most observers of France for some time. Arguing that a divided society had to be brought together, he attracted the support of many young voters, and in the first round, while finishing behind Jospin, he defeated Balladur. He narrowly beat Jospin in the second round.</p> <p>The temptation for a newly elected president is to call an immediate general election, calculating that the voters will give him a sympathetic national assembly. Chirac did not, reflecting that the existing assembly had three years to run. Alain Jupp\u00e9, a former foreign minister and long-time Chirac loyalist, was named prime minister. Various quasi-Gaullist policies, such as nuclear testing in the South Pacific, were resumed. But unpopular domestic policies and high levels of unemployment brought widespread strikes in the winter of 1995, Jupp\u00e9 became hugely unpopular and in 1997, instead of sacking him, Chirac called a general election, which the right lost. Jospin became prime minister.</p> <p>After Chirac\u2019s re-election in 2002 a general election returned the right to power in the national assembly. His reservations about the Iraq war won him applause at home and abroad but he suffered a major setback when in 2005 voters ignored his support for the planned European Union constitution, which was decisively rejected in a referendum by the electorate. The grandfatherly and archetypically provincial prime minister, Jean-Pierre Raffarin, was replaced by the patrician foreign minister, Dominique de Villepin, whose speech at the UN opposing the Iraq war had been widely hailed. But plans to offer young workers lower pay to combat youth unemployment drew angry opposition and had to be withdrawn, while the death of two young men of immigrant origin in a suburban Paris housing estate after a police chase triggered nationwide riots, giving Sarkozy a chance to a parade his hardline credentials.</p> <p>Chirac\u2019s health deteriorated. He began wearing a discreet hearing aid and in 2005 he suffered a mild stroke. Increasingly he appeared to be little more than a spectator of the vicious Villepin-Sarkozy feud, and stepped down in 2007. In 2012 Chirac made it clear he would be voting for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/francois-hollande\" title=\"\">Fran\u00e7ois Hollande</a>, the socialist challenger and eventual victor, rather than Sarkozy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3a37126e830f776c586d810dd2b9ea4c157baacd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a37126e830f776c586d810dd2b9ea4c157baacd/0_0_2048_1449/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jacques Chirac delivering a speech while his wife, Bernadette, listens, at the Saint Quentin city hall, March 2002.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"708\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jacques Chirac delivering a speech while his wife, Bernadette, listens, at the Saint Quentin city hall, March 2002.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philippe Wojazer/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1956 Chirac had married Bernadette Chodron de Courcel, daughter of a grand and wealthy Gaullist family. She was iron-willed, a devout Catholic and a product of the <em>haute bourgeoisie</em>. She had her own political career in Corr\u00e8ze, and in the later stages of Chirac\u2019s presidency emerged from his shadow as a political figure in her own right. They had two daughters, Laurence and Claude, the latter of whom became Chirac\u2019s close adviser and a powerful figure in his inner court.</p> <p>The marriage lasted but knew many vicissitudes. Chirac was serially unfaithful, as Bernadette acknowledged; his chauffeur recounted that his romantic encounters were more remarkable for their rapidity and frequency than their intensity.</p> <p>He is survived by Bernadette and Claude.

There were some positives, including his conspicuous opposition to the Iraq war, improvements to road safety and reform of military service, but at the end of his 12 years at the Elys\u00e9e Palace (during his time there the presidential term was cut from seven years to five) it was hard to point to major reforms to a society that badly needed them. He appeared to have neither the will nor the imagination to confront France\u2019s problems, including those posed by powerful and immovable vested interests and by the public finances. His career ended under a cloud when, his presidential immunity lifted, a court convicted him of corruption during his years as mayor of Paris \u2013 when, among other things, his staff used public money to employ members of his own political party in bogus jobs. By then frail and suffering from memory problems, he was not in court to hear the two-year suspended sentence imposed on him in 2011. Chirac claimed to be the political heir to Charles de Gaulle, who created the Fifth Republic, but his positions were so variable and inconsistent that he could have argued he was following in the footsteps of almost any postwar figure. His first presidency was blighted by a self-inflicted wound. Two years after his election, although his conservative allies had a parliamentary majority, he called an unnecessary general election, which the Socialist party and its allies won. There had been other instances of cohabitation (the situation under which the president and the prime minister, and so the government, come from different political families) but they had never lasted for more than two years. Chirac was stuck with the Socialist Lionel Jospin, whom he had defeated for the presidency in 1995, as prime minister for five years. His critics regarded him as an unprincipled and greedy opportunist, skilled in the politician\u2019s arts of clientelism and betrayal but lacking any real conviction and indecisive in government. Even his political enemies, though, found it hard to dislike the affable Chirac, with his gargantuan appetite for Mexican beer and rillettes (pork) sandwiches, and there was little schadenfreude at his conviction. His defenders pointed to his intelligence, energy and adaptability, and to an authentic human warmth and generosity and breadth of culture that 40 years in the political jungle had failed to extinguish. Although he did not match Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand\u2019s pharaonic works, he leaves at least one monument, the Quai Branly museum in Paris, which is dedicated to the indigenous arts and culture of non-European civilisations. Chirac was capable of acts of great grace, as evidenced by what was perhaps the finest hour of his presidency \u2013 his admission of the responsibility of the French state in the Vichy years of 1940-44, so long and so shamefully denied \u2013 and by his moving and generous tribute to Mitterrand on the latter\u2019s death in 1996. Unlike some of his political allies, he would have no truck with the far-right Front National, though its leader, Jean-Marie Le Pen, claimed, not unconvincingly, that Chirac had once asked for his support. However, few impartial observers could fail to conclude that, during his 18 years as mayor of Paris, Chirac was a willing and active participant in a system of corruption that attained heroic proportions. His lack of loyalty was legendary. While he was far from being reflexively anti-American, his dream of a multipolar world led him to cultivate friendships with Vladimir Putin, Saddam Hussein and assorted generous African tyrants. Son of Marie-Louise (nee Valette) and Abel-Fran\u00e7ois, Chirac was born in Paris. His family had rural roots in the central French region of Limousin, and his grandfather had been a teacher in the d\u00e9partement of Corr\u00e8ze. Chirac always nurtured his family\u2019s rural ties; farmers formed part of his natural constituency. Those roots were not, though, especially deep; his father was an aircraft company executive. After a secondary education in Paris, Chirac took one of the elite\u2019s classic fast tracks: Sciences Po (the Institut d\u2019\u00c9tudes Politiques de Paris), followed by the \u00c9cole Nationale d\u2019Administration and the Cour des Comptes. He found time to take a summer course at Harvard. Military service, which he relished, took him to Algeria. He was a cavalry officer and a passionate supporter of \u201cAlg\u00e9rie fran\u00e7aise\u201d. In the early 1960s, the energetic young Chirac caught the eye of Georges Pompidou, De Gaulle\u2019s prime minister. He became a member of Pompidou\u2019s cabinet and something of a protege of the rotund, worldly premier who was in many respects the polar opposite of De Gaulle. It is from this period that his nickname of le bulldozer, a tribute to his inexhaustible energy, is believed to date. Pompidou encouraged the young Chirac to add a political dimension to his technocratic activities, and he was duly elected a local councillor in Sainte-F\u00e9r\u00e9ole, Corr\u00e8ze, in 1965. He won a parliamentary seat in the nearby town of Ussel in 1967 and held it for the next 25 years. His government career began when Pompidou made him a junior minister in the social affairs department in 1967. The following year saw the civil unrest of the \u00e9v\u00e9nements of May and June, and Chirac was closely involved in the negotiations that got France back to work; legend has it that on one occasion he attended a critical meeting with a gun concealed on his person. In 1969 De Gaulle resigned after losing an unnecessary referendum, and Pompidou became president. Chirac\u2019s career flourished: middle-rank posts were followed by a spell at the agriculture ministry, where he established himself as the friend and defender of the paysan, and then the interior ministry. In 1974 Pompidou died from a painful and lingering disease that had been hidden from the public. The obvious candidate to succeed him as president was the prime minister, Jacques Chaban-Delmas, a reformist, resistance hero and authentic Gaullist. In the first of a long series of coups de th\u00e9\u00e2tre, arguing that Chaban-Delmas could not beat Mitterrand, Chirac led a group of 43 Gaullist deputies into the camp of Val\u00e9ry Giscard d\u2019Estaing, champion of the centrists and the free-market, non-Gaullist right. Giscard eliminated Chaban in the first round of voting and narrowly defeated Mitterrand in the second. Chirac was rewarded with the premiership. The relationship did not last long; Giscard had no intention of \u201cinaugurating chrysanthemums\u201d, as De Gaulle once put it, while Chirac ran policy. The president pushed through an ambitious series of social and economic reforms, not all of them to the taste of his political allies, and two years after his appointment Chirac abruptly resigned, claiming he was not being given the means to carry out his task. At the end of 1976 he founded the Rassemblement pour la R\u00e9publique (RPR) \u2013 often described as neo-Gaullist, though the general would probably have been astonished by some of its positions \u2013 transforming the drifting and divided Gaullist movement into a machine to serve the personal ambition that would propel him to the Elys\u00e9e. It also purported to defend Gaullist, nationalist and popular conservative values against the alleged Europhile and liberal policies of Giscard. The following year Chirac achieved another success when he shouldered aside Giscard\u2019s candidate to become mayor of Paris \u2013 the post restored after more than a century in abeyance. With the RPR at his disposal \u2013 over the years he was to beat off attempts by Gaullists more authentic than him to wrest it from him \u2013 and a power base in the Paris city hall, he resumed his trek to the Elys\u00e9e. In 1981 he made his first presidential bid. He was easily beaten by Mitterrand and Giscard in the first round, but the right was split and Chirac endorsed Giscard in the final round with such an obvious lack of enthusiasm that many of his supporters abstained or voted for the left, and Giscard was beaten. Mitterrand called a general election, which was won by the Socialists and their allies. During the next few years the divisions between the Paris city hall and the RPR became increasingly blurred as Chirac pursued his ambitions. In 1986 the swing of the political pendulum brought the right back to power in the national assembly and, for the second time, Chirac became prime minister: this was the first cohabitation. The new premier was no match for the crafty Mitterrand, who easily outmanoeuvred him. In 1988 Mitterrand and Chirac faced each other in the final round of the presidential election and Mitterrand was the easy winner, calling a parliamentary election, which was won by the left. Five years later the right again won a general election. After his experience in the mid-1980s, Chirac had no intention of spending two more years sparring with Mitterrand; his \u201cfriend of 30 years\u201d, the fastidious and aloof \u00c9douard Balladur, was appointed premier instead. It was clearly understood, at least by Chirac, that Balladur was a simple lieutenant and that le grand would step forward when Mitterrand\u2019s second seven-year term ended and new presidential elections took place. It was yet another miscalculation; it took very little time for Balladur to discover that he, too, would like to be president. At the start of 1995, Balladur was well ahead in the opinion polls and many of Chirac\u2019s chief supporters had switched their support to him, including the interior minister, Nicolas Sarkozy, eventually Chirac\u2019s hyperactive successor, whom he came to loathe. But Chirac, a far better and more experienced campaigner, discovered the fracture sociale that had been apparent to most observers of France for some time. Arguing that a divided society had to be brought together, he attracted the support of many young voters, and in the first round, while finishing behind Jospin, he defeated Balladur. He narrowly beat Jospin in the second round. The temptation for a newly elected president is to call an immediate general election, calculating that the voters will give him a sympathetic national assembly. Chirac did not, reflecting that the existing assembly had three years to run. Alain Jupp\u00e9, a former foreign minister and long-time Chirac loyalist, was named prime minister. Various quasi-Gaullist policies, such as nuclear testing in the South Pacific, were resumed. But unpopular domestic policies and high levels of unemployment brought widespread strikes in the winter of 1995, Jupp\u00e9 became hugely unpopular and in 1997, instead of sacking him, Chirac called a general election, which the right lost. Jospin became prime minister. After Chirac\u2019s re-election in 2002 a general election returned the right to power in the national assembly. His reservations about the Iraq war won him applause at home and abroad but he suffered a major setback when in 2005 voters ignored his support for the planned European Union constitution, which was decisively rejected in a referendum by the electorate. The grandfatherly and archetypically provincial prime minister, Jean-Pierre Raffarin, was replaced by the patrician foreign minister, Dominique de Villepin, whose speech at the UN opposing the Iraq war had been widely hailed. But plans to offer young workers lower pay to combat youth unemployment drew angry opposition and had to be withdrawn, while the death of two young men of immigrant origin in a suburban Paris housing estate after a police chase triggered nationwide riots, giving Sarkozy a chance to a parade his hardline credentials. Chirac\u2019s health deteriorated. He began wearing a discreet hearing aid and in 2005 he suffered a mild stroke. Increasingly he appeared to be little more than a spectator of the vicious Villepin-Sarkozy feud, and stepped down in 2007. In 2012 Chirac made it clear he would be voting for Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the socialist challenger and eventual victor, rather than Sarkozy. In 1956 Chirac had married Bernadette Chodron de Courcel, daughter of a grand and wealthy Gaullist family. She was iron-willed, a devout Catholic and a product of the haute bourgeoisie. She had her own political career in Corr\u00e8ze, and in the later stages of Chirac\u2019s presidency emerged from his shadow as a political figure in her own right. They had two daughters, Laurence and Claude, the latter of whom became Chirac\u2019s close adviser and a powerful figure in his inner court. The marriage lasted but knew many vicissitudes. Chirac was serially unfaithful, as Bernadette acknowledged; his chauffeur recounted that his romantic encounters were more remarkable for their rapidity and frequency than their intensity. He is survived by Bernadette and Claude. Laurence died in 2016. \u2022 Jacques Ren\u00e9 Chirac, statesman, born 29 November 1932; died 26 September 2019",

      "body": "<h2>22. The Ballad of John and Yoko (1969)</h2> \n<p>John Lennon once convened a meeting of the Beatles to inform them that he was Jesus: the charmless Ballad of John and Yoko is that crazed egotism and messiah complex wrought into song. Paul McCartney does his best to enliven a pretty wan bit of music with his contributions \u2013 playing bass, piano and drums \u2013 but it\u2019s an uphill struggle.</p> \n<h2>21. From Me to You (1963)</h2> \n<p>A step back from the thrills of Please Please Me, From Me to You was a hit written to order, and it is tempting to say it shows. On the plus side, Lennon sings the whole thing in a voice far more rasping and anguished than the song warrants, as if he is approaching the lyrics\u2019 cutesy sentiment with a distinct roll of the eyes.</p> \n<h2>20. Love Me Do (1962)</h2> \n<p>It is hard to imagine how raw and unique Love Me Do sounded in late 1962, in a singles chart dominated by \u201cyodeling\u201d Frank Ifield and Acker Bilk: the writer Ian MacDonald compared the impact of its dry, northern British sound to that of kitchen-sink realism in cinema and theatre. That said, the Beatles would swiftly outstrip the song\u2019s simplicity and modest charm.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"28ba0c87a1879ca8f1693231d1fc4fdbc828330a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/28ba0c87a1879ca8f1693231d1fc4fdbc828330a/0_854_3936_2360/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Beatles in 1967\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Psychedelic explorers: the Beatles at the recording of the All You Need Is Love film in June 1967.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Magnus/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>19. All You Need Is Love (1967)</h2> \n<p>There is a sense in which All You Need Is Love is less interesting as a song than as an artefact: the Summer of Love zenith of the hippy dream captured, just before it curdled into disillusionment. But does a hint of Lennon sarcasm slip through the net in the way he delivers the words \u201cit\u2019s easy\u201d?</p> \n<h2>18. Yellow Submarine (1966)</h2> \n<p>In the UK, at least, the Beatles tended not to issue singles from albums. That they broke their rule for Revolver\u2019s lovable but slight children\u2019s song Yellow Submarine \u2013 rather than Taxman, Here There and Everywhere or Eleanor Rigby, which was relegated to the B-side \u2013 seems faintly mind-boggling.</p> \n<h2>17. Can\u2019t Buy Me Love (1964)</h2> \n<p>Less dramatic and combustible than She Loves You or I Want to Hold Your Hand, Can\u2019t Buy Me Love was key to establishing the Beatles\u2019 cross-generational appeal: on the one hand it had a raw energy that recalled skiffle, on the other, its rhythm vaguely suggested swing, provoking a number of parent-friendly jazz covers, not least by Ella Fitzgerald.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c724d9c7dc80a602af13d42d556b99587545aeef\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c724d9c7dc80a602af13d42d556b99587545aeef/0_221_3424_2054/1000.jpg\" alt=\"McCartney, Lennon and Harrison in concert in 1963\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">McCartney, Lennon and Harrison in concert in 1963.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sharok Hatami/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>16. Lady Madonna (1968)</h2> \n<p>Pop\u2019s post-psychedelic mood was set by the earthiness of the Band\u2019s hugely influential debut Music from Big Pink. McCartney\u2019s Fats Domino homage \u2013 later recorded by Domino himself \u2013 fitted cheerily with the shift, although the fuzzed-out guitars of George Harrison and Lennon suggested something slightly more tumultuous, in keeping with the increasingly troubled mood of 1968.</p> \n<h2>15. Hello, Goodbye (1967)</h2> \n<p>Lennon was reportedly furious that I Am the Walrus was demoted to the B-side of Hello, Goodbye. While McCartney\u2019s song certainly doesn\u2019t have the venomous energy or experimental edge of Lennon\u2019s, it has got a power of its own; as a masterclass in supremely catchy songwriting, it works perfectly.</p> \n<h2>14. Please Please Me (1963)</h2> \n<p>Far more dynamic and electrifying than its predecessor Love Me Do, the Everly Brothers-inspired Please Please Me saw the Beatles harness the raucous power of their live performances in the studio. There is still something breathlessly exciting about the song\u2019s call-and-response of \u201ccome on, come on\u201d: it sounds like it is willing a new pop landscape into being.</p> \n<h2>13. I Feel Fine (1964)</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrAV5EVI4tU\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WrAV5EVI4tU?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Watch the video for I Feel Fine\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The sparkling I Feel Fine marks a transition between the carefree excitement of the early Beatles singles and the drug-fuelled experimentation to come: the former represented by the song\u2019s mood and basic pop lyrics, the latter by the (possibly Who-inspired) buzz of feedback that opens it and the intricate guitar figure that runs throughout the verse.</p> \n<h2>12 Let It Be (1970)</h2> \n<p>In 1970, the charts were sprinkled with songs that sounded hymnal, like morning-after elegies for the 60s, not least Simon &amp; Garfunkel\u2019s Bridge Over Troubled Water. Completed at the last-ever Beatles recording session, Let It Be fitted perfectly: its sheer loveliness and reassuring sentiment is an end-credits finale to their career.</p> \n<h2>11. I Want to Hold Your Hand (1963)</h2> \n<p>By now, the Beatles were on a roll. From its stammering opening guitar riff onwards, there is something really audacious about I Want to Hold Your Hand, a song written with the specific intention of making the US sit up and take note. The result was so irresistible, so sensational in its sudden melodic swoops and dynamic shifts, it succeeded in changing the face of American pop entirely.</p> \n<h2>10. A Hard Day\u2019s Night (1964)</h2> \n<p>Heralded by the most famous opening chord in rock history, concluded with a Harrison guitar part that essentially invented the Byrds, A Hard Day\u2019s Night is a joy that cannily plays on Lennon and McCartney\u2019s different personalities. The former sings the verse, gruffly protesting about work, the latter chimes in with the bridge, singing about happy domesticity.</p> \n<h2>9. Get Back (1969)</h2> \n<p>Whatever the problems with the notoriously fractious Get Back sessions of 1969, a lack of strong material wasn\u2019t one of them. The song that gave the sessions their title was McCartney\u2019s doomed dream of returning the Beatles to their roots in musical form: punchy, hard-driving R&amp;B, leavened by knowingly daft lyrics. It has got an utterly beguiling sense of ease, at odds with the fraught circumstances that birthed it.</p> \n<h2>8. Help! (1965)</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q_ZzBGPdqE\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2Q_ZzBGPdqE?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Watch the video for Help!\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cI really was crying for help,\u201d Lennon later noted, highlighting the key to the song\u2019s potency. On one level, it sounds exuberant, richly melodic and thick with harmonies, on another, there is a very real sense of desperation about the lyrics and the vocal, the first sign of Lennon\u2019s soul-bearing that would consume his initial solo albums.</p> \n<h2>7. Something/Come Together (1969)</h2> \n<p>Harrison finally gets a song on a single, albeit a double A-side: it says a great deal about the quality and elegance of Something that it outshone even Come Together, Lennon\u2019s greatest contribution to Abbey Road. The other Beatles agreed: for evidence of the attention they lavished on it, listen to McCartney\u2019s extraordinary bass playing.</p> \n<h2>6. We Can Work It Out/Day Tripper (1965)</h2> \n<p>Its addictive riff aside, there is something unappealingly snooty about Day Tripper: the sound of an acid initiate sneering at someone insufficiently hip to have turned on, tuned in and dropped out. We Can Work It Out, though, is magical: its exasperated repetitions a very realistic depiction of a domestic row; its arrangement beautifully subtle; its melody perfect.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cc77fcf5ca9aa21d67072c17cbff2af41a1651de\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc77fcf5ca9aa21d67072c17cbff2af41a1651de/0_528_1728_1037/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Beatles in front of a US flag\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The British are coming: the Beatles first invaded the US in 1964.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HO/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>5. She Loves You (1963)</h2> \n<p>These days, the music of the pre-pot Beatles tends to get unfairly overlooked: a scream-inducing prelude to the real action. That is nonsense: by any standard, She Loves You is a fabulous record. Urgent and explosive, packed to bursting with hooks and idiosyncratic twists, its two and half minutes appear to pass in the blink of eye.</p> \n<h2>4. Ticket to Ride (1965)</h2> \n<p>Beatles historians argue over whether Ticket to Ride was the band\u2019s first musical response to LSD, but whatever the impetus, it is a spectacular single. Its tumbling drums, droning guitars, self-examining lyrics and mood of stoned languor pointed to the way pop would change over the following 18 months.</p> \n<h2>3. Paperback Writer (1966)</h2> \n<p>Its satire of Swinging London\u2019s thrusting ambition is very McCartney-esque \u2013 gentle and fond, rather than biting \u2013 but Paperback Writer may be the most straightforwardly exciting of the Beatles\u2019 mid-60s singles: a supremely tight explosion of distorted guitar riffs, falsetto harmonies and subtle studio tricks. On the flip: the simultaneously thunderous and dreamy psych of Lennon\u2019s Rain, perhaps the best Beatles B-side of all.</p> \n<h2>2. Hey Jude (1968)</h2> \n<p>Philip Larkin once opined that in the mid-60s, the Beatles\u2019 experimentation \u201clost the typists in the Cavern\u201d. With all respect to the old misery, that\u2019s rubbish. Despite its boundary-pushing length, Hey Jude is as pervasive as anything they recorded. There is something universal about its gentle, urging optimism; something about its all-together-now coda that defies you not to join in.</p> \n<h2>1. Strawberry Fields Forever/Penny Lane (1967)</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtUH9z_Oey8\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HtUH9z_Oey8?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Watch the video for Strawberry Fields Forever\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The Beatles\u2019 press officer Derek Taylor wryly noted that, when the band took LSD, \u201cit was a case of four scousers exploring inner space and just finding more and more scouser down there\u201d. Certainly, acid was responsible for history\u2019s most heightened, extraordinary burst of in-my-Liverpool-home sentimentality. Lennon\u2019s evocation of his childhood was eerie, ambiguous, ever-changing: an album\u2019s-worth of ideas condensed into four astonishing minutes. McCartney\u2019s <em>seemed</em> innocent and joyous \u2013 its mood epitomised by the ecstatic piccolo trumpet solo \u2013 but Penny Lane was equally hallucinatory. \u201cThough she feels as if she\u2019s in a play,\u201d he sang, \u201cshe is, anyway\u201d: in other words, nothing is real. It is an obvious choice for their greatest single, but Strawberry Fields Forever and Penny Lane have it all. Perfect songwriting, unbelievable invention and daring, wit and warmth: the Beatles in a psychedelic nutshell.</p> \n<p><em>\u2022 This list does not include EPs, posthumous singles or reunion releases</em></p> \n<p><em>The four-CD <a href=\"https://www.thebeatlesonline.co.uk/\">Abbey Road (50th Anniversary)</a> Super Deluxe box set is released on 27 September.

      "bodyText": "22. The Ballad of John and Yoko (1969) John Lennon once convened a meeting of the Beatles to inform them that he was Jesus: the charmless Ballad of John and Yoko is that crazed egotism and messiah complex wrought into song. Paul McCartney does his best to enliven a pretty wan bit of music with his contributions \u2013 playing bass, piano and drums \u2013 but it\u2019s an uphill struggle. 21. From Me to You (1963) A step back from the thrills of Please Please Me, From Me to You was a hit written to order, and it is tempting to say it shows. On the plus side, Lennon sings the whole thing in a voice far more rasping and anguished than the song warrants, as if he is approaching the lyrics\u2019 cutesy sentiment with a distinct roll of the eyes. 20. Love Me Do (1962) It is hard to imagine how raw and unique Love Me Do sounded in late 1962, in a singles chart dominated by \u201cyodeling\u201d Frank Ifield and Acker Bilk: the writer Ian MacDonald compared the impact of its dry, northern British sound to that of kitchen-sink realism in cinema and theatre. That said, the Beatles would swiftly outstrip the song\u2019s simplicity and modest charm. 19. All You Need Is Love (1967) There is a sense in which All You Need Is Love is less interesting as a song than as an artefact: the Summer of Love zenith of the hippy dream captured, just before it curdled into disillusionment. But does a hint of Lennon sarcasm slip through the net in the way he delivers the words \u201cit\u2019s easy\u201d? 18. Yellow Submarine (1966) In the UK, at least, the Beatles tended not to issue singles from albums. That they broke their rule for Revolver\u2019s lovable but slight children\u2019s song Yellow Submarine \u2013 rather than Taxman, Here There and Everywhere or Eleanor Rigby, which was relegated to the B-side \u2013 seems faintly mind-boggling. 17. Can\u2019t Buy Me Love (1964) Less dramatic and combustible than She Loves You or I Want to Hold Your Hand, Can\u2019t Buy Me Love was key to establishing the Beatles\u2019 cross-generational appeal: on the one hand it had a raw energy that recalled skiffle, on the other, its rhythm vaguely suggested swing, provoking a number of parent-friendly jazz covers, not least by Ella Fitzgerald. 16. Lady Madonna (1968) Pop\u2019s post-psychedelic mood was set by the earthiness of the Band\u2019s hugely influential debut Music from Big Pink. McCartney\u2019s Fats Domino homage \u2013 later recorded by Domino himself \u2013 fitted cheerily with the shift, although the fuzzed-out guitars of George Harrison and Lennon suggested something slightly more tumultuous, in keeping with the increasingly troubled mood of 1968. 15. Hello, Goodbye (1967) Lennon was reportedly furious that I Am the Walrus was demoted to the B-side of Hello, Goodbye. While McCartney\u2019s song certainly doesn\u2019t have the venomous energy or experimental edge of Lennon\u2019s, it has got a power of its own; as a masterclass in supremely catchy songwriting, it works perfectly. 14. Please Please Me (1963) Far more dynamic and electrifying than its predecessor Love Me Do, the Everly Brothers-inspired Please Please Me saw the Beatles harness the raucous power of their live performances in the studio. There is still something breathlessly exciting about the song\u2019s call-and-response of \u201ccome on, come on\u201d: it sounds like it is willing a new pop landscape into being. 13. I Feel Fine (1964) The sparkling I Feel Fine marks a transition between the carefree excitement of the early Beatles singles and the drug-fuelled experimentation to come: the former represented by the song\u2019s mood and basic pop lyrics, the latter by the (possibly Who-inspired) buzz of feedback that opens it and the intricate guitar figure that runs throughout the verse. 12 Let It Be (1970) In 1970, the charts were sprinkled with songs that sounded hymnal, like morning-after elegies for the 60s, not least Simon &amp; Garfunkel\u2019s Bridge Over Troubled Water. Completed at the last-ever Beatles recording session, Let It Be fitted perfectly: its sheer loveliness and reassuring sentiment is an end-credits finale to their career. 11. I Want to Hold Your Hand (1963) By now, the Beatles were on a roll. From its stammering opening guitar riff onwards, there is something really audacious about I Want to Hold Your Hand, a song written with the specific intention of making the US sit up and take note. The result was so irresistible, so sensational in its sudden melodic swoops and dynamic shifts, it succeeded in changing the face of American pop entirely. 10. A Hard Day\u2019s Night (1964) Heralded by the most famous opening chord in rock history, concluded with a Harrison guitar part that essentially invented the Byrds, A Hard Day\u2019s Night is a joy that cannily plays on Lennon and McCartney\u2019s different personalities. The former sings the verse, gruffly protesting about work, the latter chimes in with the bridge, singing about happy domesticity. 9. Get Back (1969) Whatever the problems with the notoriously fractious Get Back sessions of 1969, a lack of strong material wasn\u2019t one of them. The song that gave the sessions their title was McCartney\u2019s doomed dream of returning the Beatles to their roots in musical form: punchy, hard-driving R&amp;B, leavened by knowingly daft lyrics. It has got an utterly beguiling sense of ease, at odds with the fraught circumstances that birthed it. 8. Help! (1965) \u201cI really was crying for help,\u201d Lennon later noted, highlighting the key to the song\u2019s potency. On one level, it sounds exuberant, richly melodic and thick with harmonies, on another, there is a very real sense of desperation about the lyrics and the vocal, the first sign of Lennon\u2019s soul-bearing that would consume his initial solo albums. 7. Something/Come Together (1969) Harrison finally gets a song on a single, albeit a double A-side: it says a great deal about the quality and elegance of Something that it outshone even Come Together, Lennon\u2019s greatest contribution to Abbey Road. The other Beatles agreed: for evidence of the attention they lavished on it, listen to McCartney\u2019s extraordinary bass playing. 6. We Can Work It Out/Day Tripper (1965) Its addictive riff aside, there is something unappealingly snooty about Day Tripper: the sound of an acid initiate sneering at someone insufficiently hip to have turned on, tuned in and dropped out. We Can Work It Out, though, is magical: its exasperated repetitions a very realistic depiction of a domestic row; its arrangement beautifully subtle; its melody perfect. 5. She Loves You (1963) These days, the music of the pre-pot Beatles tends to get unfairly overlooked: a scream-inducing prelude to the real action. That is nonsense: by any standard, She Loves You is a fabulous record. Urgent and explosive, packed to bursting with hooks and idiosyncratic twists, its two and half minutes appear to pass in the blink of eye. 4. Ticket to Ride (1965) Beatles historians argue over whether Ticket to Ride was the band\u2019s first musical response to LSD, but whatever the impetus, it is a spectacular single. Its tumbling drums, droning guitars, self-examining lyrics and mood of stoned languor pointed to the way pop would change over the following 18 months. 3. Paperback Writer (1966) Its satire of Swinging London\u2019s thrusting ambition is very McCartney-esque \u2013 gentle and fond, rather than biting \u2013 but Paperback Writer may be the most straightforwardly exciting of the Beatles\u2019 mid-60s singles: a supremely tight explosion of distorted guitar riffs, falsetto harmonies and subtle studio tricks. On the flip: the simultaneously thunderous and dreamy psych of Lennon\u2019s Rain, perhaps the best Beatles B-side of all. 2. Hey Jude (1968) Philip Larkin once opined that in the mid-60s, the Beatles\u2019 experimentation \u201clost the typists in the Cavern\u201d. With all respect to the old misery, that\u2019s rubbish. Despite its boundary-pushing length, Hey Jude is as pervasive as anything they recorded. There is something universal about its gentle, urging optimism; something about its all-together-now coda that defies you not to join in. 1. Strawberry Fields Forever/Penny Lane (1967) The Beatles\u2019 press officer Derek Taylor wryly noted that, when the band took LSD, \u201cit was a case of four scousers exploring inner space and just finding more and more scouser down there\u201d. Certainly, acid was responsible for history\u2019s most heightened, extraordinary burst of in-my-Liverpool-home sentimentality. Lennon\u2019s evocation of his childhood was eerie, ambiguous, ever-changing: an album\u2019s-worth of ideas condensed into four astonishing minutes. McCartney\u2019s seemed innocent and joyous \u2013 its mood epitomised by the ecstatic piccolo trumpet solo \u2013 but Penny Lane was equally hallucinatory. \u201cThough she feels as if she\u2019s in a play,\u201d he sang, \u201cshe is, anyway\u201d: in other words, nothing is real. It is an obvious choice for their greatest single, but Strawberry Fields Forever and Penny Lane have it all. Perfect songwriting, unbelievable invention and daring, wit and warmth: the Beatles in a psychedelic nutshell. \u2022 This list does not include EPs, posthumous singles or reunion releases The four-CD Abbey Road (50th Anniversary) Super Deluxe box set is released on 27 September.

The lesson seems to be that, if you need thinking time, you should not be scared to just take it. A mini-hiatus is not going to make you seem stupid, or incapable of expressing yourself properly. It could have quite the opposite effect.

They are only about whether the advice given by the prime minister to Her Majesty the Queen on 27 or 28 August, that parliament should be prorogued from a date between 9 and 12 September until 14 October, was lawful and the legal consequences if it was not.\u201d</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>That the court had the right to act</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u201cThe first question is whether the lawfulness of the prime minister\u2019s advice to Her Majesty is justiciable. This court holds that it is. The courts have exercised a supervisory jurisdiction over the lawfulness of acts of the government for centuries.\u201c</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>That the prorogation was not \u2018normal\u2019</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u201cIt prevented parliament from carrying out its constitutional role for five out of the possible eight weeks between the end of the summer recess and exit day on 31 October. Proroguing parliament is quite different from parliament going into recess. While parliament is prorogued, neither house can meet, debate or pass legislation. Neither house can debate government policy. Nor may members ask written or oral questions of ministers or meet and take evidence in committees\u2026This prolonged suspension of parliamentary democracy took place in quite exceptional circumstances: the fundamental change which was due to take place in the constitution of the United Kingdom on 31 October. Parliament, and in particular the House of Commons as the elected representatives of the people, has a right to a voice in how that change comes about. The effect upon the fundamentals of our democracy was extreme.\u201d</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>That Boris Johnson\u2019s advice to the Queen was unlawful</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u201cThe court is bound to conclude, therefore, that the decision to advise Her Majesty to prorogue parliament was unlawful because it had the effect of frustrating or preventing the ability of parliament to carry out its constitutional functions without reasonable justification.\u201c</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>That parliament has not been prorogued</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u201cThis court has already concluded that the prime minister\u2019s advice to Her Majesty was unlawful, void and of no effect. This means that the order in council to which it led was also unlawful, void and of no effect and should be quashed. This means that when the royal commissioners walked into the House of Lords it was as if they walked in with a blank sheet of paper. The prorogation was also void and of no effect. Parliament has not been prorogued. This is the unanimous judgment of all 11 Justices.\u201d</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What happens next?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u201cIt is for parliament, and in particular the Speaker and the Lord Speaker, to decide what to do next. Unless there is some parliamentary rule of which we are unaware, they can take immediate steps to enable each house to meet as soon as possible. It is not clear to us that any step is needed from the prime minister, but if it is, the court is pleased that his counsel have told the court that he will take all necessary steps to comply with the terms of any declaration made by this court.\u201d</p>\n    <p><i>The <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2019-0192-judgment.pdf\">full judgment</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2019-0192-summary.pdf\">summary judgment</a> can be downloaded from the Supreme court website.</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cI have bought a stab vest and will hire personal security too.

We\u2019ve just reminded her about a tweet from Cliff Bleszinski, the former lead designer on the Gears of War franchise, which she has worked on for several years. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/sep/06/gears-5-review-thrills-kills-and-belly-laughs-in-a-refreshing-reboot\">Gears 5</a>, the latest title in the Gears of War series, has a female protagonist for the first time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/sep/06/gears-5-review-thrills-kills-and-belly-laughs-in-a-refreshing-reboot\">Gears 5 review \u2013 thrills, kills and belly laughs in a refreshing reboot</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cNot gonna lie,\u201d wrote Bleszinski. \u201cSeeing a woman on the cover of a Gears game makes me happy. I was told for decades \u2018games with female leads don\u2019t sell.\u2019\u201d When it was announced that Corporal Kait Diaz \u2013 previously a side character \u2013 would replace Marcus Fenix as the face of the studio\u2019s incredibly successful \u2013 and incredibly macho \u2013 franchise, some industry watchers saw it as a bold move. But Curnoe is tired of thinking about female leads as a risky proposition. \u201cIt\u2019d be great if we could stop talking about it to some degree,\u201d she says, \u201cand having a woman lead just becomes normal.\u201d</p> <p>The theory of the female lead as commercial suicide is largely down to a spreadsheet. In 2005, when Bleszinski and Rod Fergusson were etching the first outlines of an apocalyptic sci-fi universe, decisions about what to make were driven by marketers who\u2019d \u201chave some sort of master spreadsheet where they could type in a bunch of parameters and forecast what they\u2019d think your game would do,\u201d Fergusson remembers. \u201cVideo games are long investments. You\u2019re spending millions of dollars over three, sometimes seven years \u2013 but you don\u2019t have a crystal ball telling you what\u2019s going to be right for the industry seven years from now [\u2026] There\u2019s going to be stuff they do that\u2019s risky, so there are other things that are easier to de-risk, which is \u2018well, I\u2019ll just have a white male as my lead character.\u2019 We\u2019ve moved away from that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"42534005a89633ed929f47dfa07cd41ce60d9505\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42534005a89633ed929f47dfa07cd41ce60d9505/59_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In Gears, the hero mantle passes from series regular Marcus Fenix to Kait Diaz.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In Gears, the hero mantle passes from series regular Marcus Fenix to Kait Diaz.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Microsoft</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s true, the 90s\u2019 Lara Croft \u2013 with her hot pants and seductively clipped consonants \u2013 may be one of our most famous female gaming icons, but she achieved this while somewhat conforming to the objectifying tastes of the era\u2019s lad culture. In recent years, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/feb/20/horizon-zero-dawn-review-a-stunning-but-barely-evolved-rpg-contradiction\">Horizon: Zero Dawn</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/03/uncharted-lost-legacy-shows-filmic-games-still-screen-magic\">Uncharted: The Lost Legacy</a>, Hellblade: Senua\u2019s Sacrifice, and the rebooted Tomb Raider, have all proven that action games can achieve commercial and critical success with nuanced women leading the story. Yet data crunched by <a href=\"https://feministfrequency.com/\">Feminist Frequency</a> reveals that only 7% of games featured at E3 conferences since 2015 have had female leads \u2013 over three times as many have male central heroes.</p> <p>Heated resistance to high-profile franchises putting women in pole position hasn\u2019t helped. \u201c#NotMyBattlefield\u201d started trending on Twitter after female soldiers were introduced to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/may/24/battlefield-v-game-women-soldiers-of-second-world-war\">Battlefield V</a>; a soot-flecked, dual-gun wielding woman bursting from the cover art. Most complaints were couched in concerns over \u201chistorical accuracy\u201d (despite famous female world war-era soldiers such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyudmila_Pavlichenko\">Lyudmila Pavlichenko</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanda_Gertz\">Wanda Gertz</a>). Maker\u2019s EA Dice had to point out, \u201cThe Battlefield sandbox has always been about playing the way you want. Like attempting to fit three players on a galloping horse, with flamethrowers.

The response to Kait from core Gears fans, however, has been positive. \u201c[Fans aren\u2019t] calling out that she\u2019s a female protagonist, they\u2019re calling out that they are wrapped up in her story,\u201d says franchise narrative lead Bonnie Jean Mah. \u201cWe\u2019ve invested in Kait wholeheartedly \u2026 and just to see the reaction from our players is very rewarding and shows it was the right choice.\u201d</p> <p>The community\u2019s acceptance of Kait (compared to the Battlefield V controversy or historical gripes with Total War: Rome 2\u2019s female generals) was partly due to how The Coalition exploited the game\u2019s sci-fi setting. \u201cGears as a franchise is a Star Trekkian utopia in some ways on top of an apocalypse,\u201d says Ferguson. \u201cWe don\u2019t have homophobia, racism or sexism. They\u2019re fighting for their lives in a genocidal war. We don\u2019t need the humans fighting among themselves over petty things. And so it was important to Cliff and I back in 2005 that we had a diverse cast, at least ethnically, and then as we got into Gears 3 we were able to bring gender more into the forefront.\u201d</p> <p>Then there is Gears\u2019 strong narrative spine, which allowed the team to smoothly bend the series in this direction. It turns out, the team carefully planned <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZF0eLlfW8\">Kait\u2019s ascension over a number of years</a>, ensuring that her evolution into a central hero felt natural. Mysteries over her lineage surfaces in 2016\u2019s Gears of War 4, and this compelling narrative, fleshed out by tie-in novels written by Karen Traviss and Jason Hough, paved an unassailable route.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"88e8bab528a7eef6da39fc03d1fb3c235af9c5f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88e8bab528a7eef6da39fc03d1fb3c235af9c5f6/87_0_1113_668/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Fans are wrapped up in her story\u2019 Kait Diaz in Gears 5.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Fans are wrapped up in her story\u2019 Kait Diaz in Gears 5.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Microsoft</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kait\u2019s popularity can also be ascribed to her strength of personality. Of course the term \u201cstrong female character\u201d is amorphous and often reductive, easily used to describe a titillating twentysomething who can roundhouse kick in stilettos. For Mah, however, \u201ca strong character is someone who\u2019s authentic, who\u2019s real, who has that range of emotions, who can be vulnerable, who can show bravery and personal strength. By having Kait out there demonstrating to us what a believable character looks like, to us it naturally moves the bar.\u201d Acutely aware of the \u201csave the princess\u201d trope, the team worked hard to write Kait\u2019s story so while her fellow soldiers could support her, JD and others never had to save her.</p> <p>But perhaps the key element in the establishment of Kait as an authentic lead was structural.

      "bodyText": "Z\u00f6e Curnoe, a senior producer at video game developer The Coalition, lets out a long sigh. We\u2019ve just reminded her about a tweet from Cliff Bleszinski, the former lead designer on the Gears of War franchise, which she has worked on for several years. Gears 5, the latest title in the Gears of War series, has a female protagonist for the first time. \u201cNot gonna lie,\u201d wrote Bleszinski. \u201cSeeing a woman on the cover of a Gears game makes me happy. I was told for decades \u2018games with female leads don\u2019t sell.\u2019\u201d When it was announced that Corporal Kait Diaz \u2013 previously a side character \u2013 would replace Marcus Fenix as the face of the studio\u2019s incredibly successful \u2013 and incredibly macho \u2013 franchise, some industry watchers saw it as a bold move. But Curnoe is tired of thinking about female leads as a risky proposition. \u201cIt\u2019d be great if we could stop talking about it to some degree,\u201d she says, \u201cand having a woman lead just becomes normal.\u201d The theory of the female lead as commercial suicide is largely down to a spreadsheet. In 2005, when Bleszinski and Rod Fergusson were etching the first outlines of an apocalyptic sci-fi universe, decisions about what to make were driven by marketers who\u2019d \u201chave some sort of master spreadsheet where they could type in a bunch of parameters and forecast what they\u2019d think your game would do,\u201d Fergusson remembers. \u201cVideo games are long investments. You\u2019re spending millions of dollars over three, sometimes seven years \u2013 but you don\u2019t have a crystal ball telling you what\u2019s going to be right for the industry seven years from now [\u2026] There\u2019s going to be stuff they do that\u2019s risky, so there are other things that are easier to de-risk, which is \u2018well, I\u2019ll just have a white male as my lead character.\u2019 We\u2019ve moved away from that.\u201d It\u2019s true, the 90s\u2019 Lara Croft \u2013 with her hot pants and seductively clipped consonants \u2013 may be one of our most famous female gaming icons, but she achieved this while somewhat conforming to the objectifying tastes of the era\u2019s lad culture. In recent years, Horizon: Zero Dawn, Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, Hellblade: Senua\u2019s Sacrifice, and the rebooted Tomb Raider, have all proven that action games can achieve commercial and critical success with nuanced women leading the story. Yet data crunched by Feminist Frequency reveals that only 7% of games featured at E3 conferences since 2015 have had female leads \u2013 over three times as many have male central heroes. Heated resistance to high-profile franchises putting women in pole position hasn\u2019t helped. \u201c#NotMyBattlefield\u201d started trending on Twitter after female soldiers were introduced to Battlefield V; a soot-flecked, dual-gun wielding woman bursting from the cover art. Most complaints were couched in concerns over \u201chistorical accuracy\u201d (despite famous female world war-era soldiers such as Lyudmila Pavlichenko and Wanda Gertz). Maker\u2019s EA Dice had to point out, \u201cThe Battlefield sandbox has always been about playing the way you want. Like attempting to fit three players on a galloping horse, with flamethrowers. With BFV, you also get the chance to play as who you want. This is #everyonesbattlefield.\u201d Realism and escapist action dance a constant tango in video games, and Dice\u2019s defenders accused indignant fans of using history as a crutch for bigotry. The response to Kait from core Gears fans, however, has been positive. \u201c[Fans aren\u2019t] calling out that she\u2019s a female protagonist, they\u2019re calling out that they are wrapped up in her story,\u201d says franchise narrative lead Bonnie Jean Mah. \u201cWe\u2019ve invested in Kait wholeheartedly \u2026 and just to see the reaction from our players is very rewarding and shows it was the right choice.\u201d The community\u2019s acceptance of Kait (compared to the Battlefield V controversy or historical gripes with Total War: Rome 2\u2019s female generals) was partly due to how The Coalition exploited the game\u2019s sci-fi setting. \u201cGears as a franchise is a Star Trekkian utopia in some ways on top of an apocalypse,\u201d says Ferguson. \u201cWe don\u2019t have homophobia, racism or sexism. They\u2019re fighting for their lives in a genocidal war. We don\u2019t need the humans fighting among themselves over petty things. And so it was important to Cliff and I back in 2005 that we had a diverse cast, at least ethnically, and then as we got into Gears 3 we were able to bring gender more into the forefront.\u201d Then there is Gears\u2019 strong narrative spine, which allowed the team to smoothly bend the series in this direction. It turns out, the team carefully planned Kait\u2019s ascension over a number of years, ensuring that her evolution into a central hero felt natural. Mysteries over her lineage surfaces in 2016\u2019s Gears of War 4, and this compelling narrative, fleshed out by tie-in novels written by Karen Traviss and Jason Hough, paved an unassailable route. Kait\u2019s popularity can also be ascribed to her strength of personality. Of course the term \u201cstrong female character\u201d is amorphous and often reductive, easily used to describe a titillating twentysomething who can roundhouse kick in stilettos. For Mah, however, \u201ca strong character is someone who\u2019s authentic, who\u2019s real, who has that range of emotions, who can be vulnerable, who can show bravery and personal strength. By having Kait out there demonstrating to us what a believable character looks like, to us it naturally moves the bar.\u201d Acutely aware of the \u201csave the princess\u201d trope, the team worked hard to write Kait\u2019s story so while her fellow soldiers could support her, JD and others never had to save her. But perhaps the key element in the establishment of Kait as an authentic lead was structural. The Coalition believes the only way to write well-rounded female characters is to have women on the development team. Current statistics suggest that women make up just 20% of game development staff worldwide. But Fergusson suggests a studio should match its audience. \u201cIn the industry now, our player base is 50/50 male and female,\u201d he says. \u201cSo you can better represent the content you want to create for your players if your studio culture represents that.\u201d Curnoe agrees: \u201cThis is probably the most inclusive culture I\u2019ve ever been a part of, and I\u2019ve been in the industry for 15 years \u2026 When you see it every day among your leaders, it trickles down and tends to spread out among the people that you work with.\u201d The Coalition\u2019s leadership endorsed Gears 5\u2019s creative direction from the beginning of the project, while the studio introduced resources to connect women across different teams, and invited the wider development community to a panel in January that Curnoe says was \u201cmade up mostly of women and non-binary people talking about diverse characters in games, and how to create that representation\u201d.

      "bodyText": "BBC news journalist George Alagiah worked extensively in South Africa, and he has put his knowledge to good use in his debut novel. The Burning Land (Canongate, \u00a314.99) is a political thriller that contrasts the perception of a post-apartheid \u201crainbow nation\u201d of equal opportunities with the corrupt and often violent reality, in which the gap between rich and poor grows wider by the day. Shady deals by people at the top are resulting in large tracts of the country being sold to foreign investors, leaving those who farmed it without jobs or homes. Activist Lesedi Motlantshe, son of a prominent anti-apartheid campaigner who is now busy lining his pockets, is murdered. Childhood friends Lindi Seaton, the well-intentioned daughter of white liberals who works in conflict resolution, and Kagiso Rapabane, the activist son of the Seatons\u2019 former housekeeper, form an awkward alliance in order to discover the truth. Although Alagiah makes fairly heavy weather of the necessary scene-setting and exposition, it\u2019s worth hanging in there, as the plot shifts up a gear and becomes a gripping tale of events spinning out of control in a country struggling to redefine itself.

Whatever the reason, he\u2019s not kidding, as evidenced by single Sing Along: a wall of crunching glam guitars and fizzing analogue synths, underpinned by a frantic four-to-the-floor disco beat, with a vague hint of the drum machine-driven fuzz found on ZZ Top\u2019s Eliminator stirred into the mix.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpSMoBp8awM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SpSMoBp8awM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>And if Simpson is as discomfited by success and critical praise as Mercury in Retrograde suggests \u2013 journalists and people asking what his songs mean seem to rank only slightly higher in his estimation than hypocrites building brands \u2013 then unfortunately, he\u2019s going to have to suck it up for a little while longer. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpSMoBp8awM&amp;feature=youtu.be\">Sing Along</a>, like the rest of Sound &amp; Fury, is awesome: powerful, fierce, irresistible.</p> <p>Apparently recorded while films by Japanese director Akira Kurosawa played silently in the studio, the album is the soundtrack to its own film, an anime loosely based on Kurosawa\u2019s samurai epic Yojimbo. Without wishing to cause despair to whoever ponied up the film\u2019s $1.2m, Sound &amp; Fury is better heard stripped of its visual accompaniment. Without it, the album\u2019s structure becomes thrillingly inexplicable and unpredictable: its songs frequently don\u2019t end, or at least reach any kind of identifiable conclusion. They just crash into the next track as if someone\u2019s frantically switching channels on a TV, or suddenly fade out, replaced by bursts of feedback and electronic noise or burbling synthesiser arpeggios.</p> <p>Before that happens, the songs have already done enough to get their hooks in you. Every track, from the agitated faux-rockabilly of Last Man Standing to the fabulous combination of distinctly Bolan-esque boogie and world-weary tune offered up on Make Art Not Friends, to All Said and Done, a wracked ballad that crackles and hisses with distortion, is an object lesson in musical economy. In contrast to the complexity of A Sailor\u2019s Guide to Earth, they offer beautifully simple, direct melodies and indelible riffs buoyed by the needles-in-the-red intensity of the production and by the way Simpson\u2019s frequently down-home lyrics \u2013 \u201cTell \u2019em to carve my name on that bar stool, baby, / I\u2019m gonna be here a while\u201d \u2013 rub against the wilfully synthetic but visceral nature of the sound.</p> <p>It climaxes with Fastest Horse in Town, a psychedelicised take on old-fashioned, pre-Nevermind grunge: dense, corrosive guitars howling and arcing around Simpson\u2019s voice, the latter rendered incomprehensible with reverb and electronic effects. It\u2019s a hugely exciting end to a hugely exciting album that underlines Simpson\u2019s status as a daring, restless and unique artist. He isn\u2019t the first musician to throw his label a curveball while protesting about the pressures of fame and the grim nature of the music business. That said, it\u2019s hard to think of anyone else who\u2019s done it by making an album as gripping and enjoyable as this.</p> <h2>This week Alexis listened to</h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://holodrum.bandcamp.com/track/no-dither\">Holodrum: No Dither</a></strong><br>Straight out of Halifax: fidgety, sax and synth-driven punk-disco that takes on an increasingly psychedelic sheen as it progresses.</p>",

Given Simpson\u2019s previously noted unbiddable nature \u2013 and indeed Sound &amp; Fury\u2019s preponderance of lyrics that wrestle unhappily with the fame occasioned by A Sailor\u2019s Guide to Earth\u2019s success and with the machinations of the music industry, or as Mercury in Retrograde puts it, \u201chypocrites building brands\u201d \u2013 you do wonder if announcing that his new album is influenced by a foppish glam idol who made virtually no commercial impact in the US and an androgynous British synthpop revivalist doesn\u2019t come with a gleeful side-order of screw-you to the country establishment. Whatever the reason, he\u2019s not kidding, as evidenced by single Sing Along: a wall of crunching glam guitars and fizzing analogue synths, underpinned by a frantic four-to-the-floor disco beat, with a vague hint of the drum machine-driven fuzz found on ZZ Top\u2019s Eliminator stirred into the mix. And if Simpson is as discomfited by success and critical praise as Mercury in Retrograde suggests \u2013 journalists and people asking what his songs mean seem to rank only slightly higher in his estimation than hypocrites building brands \u2013 then unfortunately, he\u2019s going to have to suck it up for a little while longer. Sing Along, like the rest of Sound &amp; Fury, is awesome: powerful, fierce, irresistible. Apparently recorded while films by Japanese director Akira Kurosawa played silently in the studio, the album is the soundtrack to its own film, an anime loosely based on Kurosawa\u2019s samurai epic Yojimbo. Without wishing to cause despair to whoever ponied up the film\u2019s $1.2m, Sound &amp; Fury is better heard stripped of its visual accompaniment. Without it, the album\u2019s structure becomes thrillingly inexplicable and unpredictable: its songs frequently don\u2019t end, or at least reach any kind of identifiable conclusion. They just crash into the next track as if someone\u2019s frantically switching channels on a TV, or suddenly fade out, replaced by bursts of feedback and electronic noise or burbling synthesiser arpeggios. Before that happens, the songs have already done enough to get their hooks in you. Every track, from the agitated faux-rockabilly of Last Man Standing to the fabulous combination of distinctly Bolan-esque boogie and world-weary tune offered up on Make Art Not Friends, to All Said and Done, a wracked ballad that crackles and hisses with distortion, is an object lesson in musical economy. In contrast to the complexity of A Sailor\u2019s Guide to Earth, they offer beautifully simple, direct melodies and indelible riffs buoyed by the needles-in-the-red intensity of the production and by the way Simpson\u2019s frequently down-home lyrics \u2013 \u201cTell \u2019em to carve my name on that bar stool, baby, / I\u2019m gonna be here a while\u201d \u2013 rub against the wilfully synthetic but visceral nature of the sound. It climaxes with Fastest Horse in Town, a psychedelicised take on old-fashioned, pre-Nevermind grunge: dense, corrosive guitars howling and arcing around Simpson\u2019s voice, the latter rendered incomprehensible with reverb and electronic effects. It\u2019s a hugely exciting end to a hugely exciting album that underlines Simpson\u2019s status as a daring, restless and unique artist. He isn\u2019t the first musician to throw his label a curveball while protesting about the pressures of fame and the grim nature of the music business. That said, it\u2019s hard to think of anyone else who\u2019s done it by making an album as gripping and enjoyable as this. This week Alexis listened to Holodrum: No Dither Straight out of Halifax: fidgety, sax and synth-driven punk-disco that takes on an increasingly psychedelic sheen as it progresses.",

      "body": "<p>Racism blights youth football in Italy as much as it does the top leagues, with about 80 cases recorded over the last two seasons, campaigners have said.</p> <p>The issue has resurfaced after a string of incidents in Serie A in recent weeks, but scant attention has been given to what occurs in the lower rungs. Children as young as 12 are suffering racist abuse from adversaries and spectators, according to an independent organisation that collates data on racism incidents.</p> <p>\u201cThe attention on racism in football has only been noted when it happens in Serie A or B,\u201d said Mauro Valeri, who leads the Observatory on Racism in Football. \u201cHowever, there are many episodes in the youth teams, especially among very young players. The issue is not considered to be a serious problem. But in reality, if you look at the quantity \u2013 in the last two years alone I\u2019ve registered about 80 episodes.\u201d</p> <p>Fifa\u2019s president, Gianni Infantino, <a href=\"https://www.eurosport.co.uk/football/time-to-punish-racists-fifa-chief-tells-italian-football-authorities_sto7471191/story.shtml\">urged the Italian football authorities to punish racists</a> on Sunday after a Serie A match was briefly suspended following complaints from the Fiorentina player Dalbert that he was the target of racist chants and monkey noises from Atalanta fans.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t have racism in society or in football,\u201d Infantino said. \u201cIn Italy the situation hasn\u2019t improved and this is serious.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/02/romelu-lukaku-racism-going-backwards-inter-cagliari-calls-action\">Romelu Lukaku says \u2018we\u2019re going backwards\u2019 in fight against racism</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Days earlier the Inter Milan coach, Antonio Conte, noted that racism in Italian football was getting \u201cworse and worse\u201d after Inter\u2019s Romelu Lukaku was subjected to abuse during a match against Cagliari. A high-profile pundit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/16/italian-pundit-sacked-saying-only-way-to-stop-lukaku-is-to-give-him-bananas\">was then sacked</a> after using the word \u201cbanana\u201d when describing Lukaku\u2019s play.</p> <p>Valeri <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/commentisfree/2019/sep/15/heres-why-local-journalism-must-find-a-way-to-survive\">depends on local newspapers</a> to track the prevalence of racism in youth football. In March, spectators yelled racist abuse at a 14-year-old goalkeeper, Eddie Gallinari, born in Italy to Ecuadorian-Italian parents, during a game between local sides in Savona, Liguria. The insults were heard by Gallinari\u2019s mother, Ana Montoya Vera, as she watched her son\u2019s team, Priamar, play Cairese.</p> <p>\u201cIt was very upsetting and it affected Eddie more at the time because he had just lost his grandad,\u201d said Montoya Vera. \u201cBut he is mature and we spoke about it and challenged it. The problem of racism has grown and if it\u2019s not dealt with adequately then the taunts could lead to something more serious, especially if it happens to a child who is not so strong.\u201d</p> <p>The racists were never identified and while Cairese apologised, the club shirked responsibility for its fans.</p> <p>Gallinari\u2019s case received more media coverage than usual following the intervention of Simone Valente, a parliamentarian with the Five Star Movement, who at the time was an under-secretary at the Ministry of Sport.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s important that the government condemns these acts immediately,\u201d said Valente, who was born in Savona. \u201cBut essentially, confronting racism needs to start in schools. Almost every week you read about a case at youth level, but even if it only happens once a year it\u2019s no different. Racism shouldn\u2019t exist at all.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/17/cagliari-serie-a-avoid-sanction-fans-racist-abuse-romelu-lukaku\">Cagliari fined for fans throwing bottles but not racist abuse of Lukaku</a> </p> </aside>  <p>According to guidelines from the Italian football federation, a referee can abandon a match if two warnings, given over the PA system, fail to stop racist chants. Players found guilty of racism face disqualification. But racism is most prevalent among fans, who are more difficult to identify and punish. Cagliari escaped punishment over the alleged abuse of Lukaku because the stadium chants were inaudible.</p> <p>The issue is even more difficult to address in youth games as matches are played in stadiums that are not equipped with the technology to record the evidence.

      "bodyText": "Racism blights youth football in Italy as much as it does the top leagues, with about 80 cases recorded over the last two seasons, campaigners have said. The issue has resurfaced after a string of incidents in Serie A in recent weeks, but scant attention has been given to what occurs in the lower rungs. Children as young as 12 are suffering racist abuse from adversaries and spectators, according to an independent organisation that collates data on racism incidents. \u201cThe attention on racism in football has only been noted when it happens in Serie A or B,\u201d said Mauro Valeri, who leads the Observatory on Racism in Football. \u201cHowever, there are many episodes in the youth teams, especially among very young players. The issue is not considered to be a serious problem. But in reality, if you look at the quantity \u2013 in the last two years alone I\u2019ve registered about 80 episodes.\u201d Fifa\u2019s president, Gianni Infantino, urged the Italian football authorities to punish racists on Sunday after a Serie A match was briefly suspended following complaints from the Fiorentina player Dalbert that he was the target of racist chants and monkey noises from Atalanta fans. \u201cYou can\u2019t have racism in society or in football,\u201d Infantino said. \u201cIn Italy the situation hasn\u2019t improved and this is serious.\u201d Days earlier the Inter Milan coach, Antonio Conte, noted that racism in Italian football was getting \u201cworse and worse\u201d after Inter\u2019s Romelu Lukaku was subjected to abuse during a match against Cagliari. A high-profile pundit was then sacked after using the word \u201cbanana\u201d when describing Lukaku\u2019s play. Valeri depends on local newspapers to track the prevalence of racism in youth football. In March, spectators yelled racist abuse at a 14-year-old goalkeeper, Eddie Gallinari, born in Italy to Ecuadorian-Italian parents, during a game between local sides in Savona, Liguria. The insults were heard by Gallinari\u2019s mother, Ana Montoya Vera, as she watched her son\u2019s team, Priamar, play Cairese. \u201cIt was very upsetting and it affected Eddie more at the time because he had just lost his grandad,\u201d said Montoya Vera. \u201cBut he is mature and we spoke about it and challenged it. The problem of racism has grown and if it\u2019s not dealt with adequately then the taunts could lead to something more serious, especially if it happens to a child who is not so strong.\u201d The racists were never identified and while Cairese apologised, the club shirked responsibility for its fans. Gallinari\u2019s case received more media coverage than usual following the intervention of Simone Valente, a parliamentarian with the Five Star Movement, who at the time was an under-secretary at the Ministry of Sport. \u201cIt\u2019s important that the government condemns these acts immediately,\u201d said Valente, who was born in Savona. \u201cBut essentially, confronting racism needs to start in schools. Almost every week you read about a case at youth level, but even if it only happens once a year it\u2019s no different. Racism shouldn\u2019t exist at all.\u201d According to guidelines from the Italian football federation, a referee can abandon a match if two warnings, given over the PA system, fail to stop racist chants. Players found guilty of racism face disqualification. But racism is most prevalent among fans, who are more difficult to identify and punish. Cagliari escaped punishment over the alleged abuse of Lukaku because the stadium chants were inaudible. The issue is even more difficult to address in youth games as matches are played in stadiums that are not equipped with the technology to record the evidence. Valeri said racist abuse in the stands came from children and parents of rival players. He said it was not taken seriously as people denied they were being racist even when they used racist language. \u201cThose in positions of responsibility just say that words don\u2019t hurt,\u201d said Valeri. \u201cThe problem is very deep \u2026 Italy has never regarded itself as a multi-ethnic country, and while other countries have seriously addressed racism in football, Italy never has.\u201d",

And the prime minister appeared to point-blank refuse to go to Brussels to get an article 50 extension if there was no deal by the end of October, as now required by law. Here are some of the key exchanges.</p> <h2>On the prime minister\u2019s language</h2> <p><strong>Paula </strong><strong>Sherriff (Labour, Dewsbury):</strong> \u201cI genuinely do not seek to stifle robust debate, but this evening the prime minister has continually used pejorative language to describe an act of parliament passed by this house. And I\u2019m sure you would agree, Mr Speaker, that we should not resort to using offensive, dangerous or inflammatory language for legislation that we do not like.</p> <p>\u201cAnd we stand here, Mr Speaker, under the shield of our departed friend [the murdered MP Jo Cox] with many of us in this place subject to death threats and abuse every single day. And let me tell the prime minister that they often quote his words, \u2018surrender\u2019, \u2018betrayal\u2019, \u2018traitor\u2019, and I for one am sick of it. And it has to come from the prime minister first. So I would be interested in hearing his opinion, he should be absolutely ashamed of himself.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6fd0f5a1e4c513c3255c9cf60f9fd4d6eeb5a22c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fd0f5a1e4c513c3255c9cf60f9fd4d6eeb5a22c/325_0_1858_1114/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The MP Paula Sherriff.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The MP Paula Sherriff said the PM should not resort to using \u2018offensive, dangerous or inflammatory language\u2019 to describe legislation he did not like.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HO/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Boris Johnson (prime minister, Conservative, Uxbridge and South Ruislip</strong><strong>):</strong> \u201cI think Mr Speaker, I have to tell you Mr Speaker, I have to say Mr Speaker, that I have never heard so much humbug in my life.\u201d</p> <h2>On honouring Jo Cox\u2019s memory</h2> <p><strong>Tracy Brabin (Labour, Batley and Spen \u2013 Jo Cox\u2019s former constituency)</strong>: \u201cHearing from the prime minister, words like \u2018the humiliation act\u2019, \u2018the surrender act\u2019, the capitulation act\u2019, all of these words are suggesting that because we disagree with him we are traitors, we are not patriots. Nothing could be further from the truth. Now, this may be a strategy to set the people against the establishment. I would like to gently suggest that he is the establishment and we are still people. As the woman who has taken over a seat that was left by our dear friend Jo Cox, can I ask him, in all honesty, as a human being, going forward, will he moderate his language so that we will all feel secure when going about our jobs.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Boris Johnson:</strong> \u201cCan I say that the surest fire way \u2026 I think the \u2026 Of course there will be an attempt to obfuscate the effect of this act, but it does \u2026 the capitulation act or the surrender act, or whatever you want to call it. It does, it does, I\u2019m sorry but it greatly enfeebles this government\u2019s ability to negotiate. But what I will say is the best way to honour the memory and indeed the best way to bring this country together would be, I think, to get Brexit done.\u201d</p> <h2>On populist rhetoric</h2> <p><strong>Caroline Lucas (Green, Brighton Pavillion</strong><strong>):</strong> \u201cThe tone of the prime minister\u2019s speech was truly shocking, and if he recognises that tensions are inflamed, it is up to him not to stoke them further by whipping up hatred, treating parliament with contempt and dividing our country still further. This populist rhetoric is not only unfitting for a prime minister; it is genuinely and seriously dangerous.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"589d4d0768e6c7d434d98ee117a112b5d96ce831\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/589d4d0768e6c7d434d98ee117a112b5d96ce831/0_1118_3632_2178/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jo Cox.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Referring to the murdered MP Jo Cox, Paula Sherriff said many MPs were subjected to death threats and abuse every day.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Family Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>On the phrase \u2018surrender act\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Ian Blackford (SNP, Ross, Skye and Lochaber</strong><strong>): </strong>\u201cI hear the prime minister talking about a surrender act. How despicable that, when he refers to members of this house who are doing their duty to protect our constituents, he uses language such as \u2018surrender\u2019. That language is not suitable for the prime minister of any country.\u201d</p> <h2>On MPs\u2019 families receiving death threats</h2> <p><strong>Anna Soubry (Independent Group for Change, Broxtowe</strong><strong>):</strong> \u201cOn a point of order, Mr Speaker, I, too, am very sad that the prime minister has left, because I had hoped to raise this point of order to give him the opportunity to perhaps correct the record and reflect on his language and conduct in this house tonight. It gives me no pleasure to say that I am 62, I have been around and I have seen quite a lot of stuff in my life. It takes a lot to reduce this honourable member to tears. I am not alone tonight; there are others who I believe have left the estate, such has been their distress.</p> <p>\u201cI merely say to everybody in this place, but most notably to those who hold the highest of offices in this the most peculiar and extraordinary of political times, that the language that is used is incredibly important. Whatever side of the debate people are on, we have evidence that when they use words such as \u2018surrender\u2019 or \u2018capitulation\u2019, or others use the words \u2018traitor\u2019 and \u2018treason\u2019, there is a direct consequence. It means my mother receives a threat to her safety. It means my partner receives a death threat.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"04947f508e5bf6eb4207f9649235ff88eac9623f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04947f508e5bf6eb4207f9649235ff88eac9623f/365_0_2195_1317/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jo Swinson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, said she had reported a death threat against her child to the police.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Jo Swinson (</strong><strong>Liberal Democrat leader, East Dunbartonshire):</strong> \u201cI fear that the public watching today will perhaps take the view that this house does not take sufficiently seriously threats of violence. Earlier today, we had the attorney general joke about wife beating. When asked whether they would bring forward the domestic abuse bill now that parliament has resumed, we had the government dismiss those requests, and we have had the comments that were made by the honourable member for Dewsbury [Paula Sherriff] recalling Jo Cox MP and the threats that MPs face on a daily basis \u2013 I may add that, today, I have reported to the police a threat against my child \u2013 and that was dismissed as humbug. This is a disgraceful state of affairs, and we must be able to find a way to conduct ourselves better.\u201d</p> <h2>On the distress caused to Jo Cox\u2019s family</h2> <p><strong>Lucy Powell (Labour, Manchester Central</strong><strong>):</strong> \u201cOn a point of order, Mr Speaker. I know that some of these points have been made already, but I just wanted to remind the house that Jo\u2019s murder did not happen in a vacuum. It happened in a context \u2013 a context that is not dissimilar to the context we find ourselves in today. I have heard from Jo\u2019s family this evening, and they have been very distressed by watching this place today. I know others have said it, but it has come from one side of the house: the language of \u2018surrender\u2019, of \u2018betrayal\u2019 and of \u2018capitulation\u2019. This is the kind of language and the context that led to the murder of an MP leaving her surgery of an evening in a small market town by somebody from the far right, and we cannot forget that context when we conduct ourselves. I just wanted to put that on the record.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/26/boris-johnson-urged-to-calm-commons-inferno-of-rhetoric\">Boris Johnson urged to calm Commons 'inferno of rhetoric'</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>John Bercow (Speaker): </strong>\u201cThat point is duly noted. It is a very serious point. I do not want to add to it, but suffice it to say that although I do not know the Cox family anything \u200blike as well as the honourable lady or many other members here present, I do know members of the family. I have a strong empathy with the objectives of the Jo Cox Foundation, and indeed I am in touch with the family from time to time, including currently in relation to upcoming events, so I am not unsighted on the issues. I do not think any of us in this chamber will ever forget or entirely overcome our horror, revulsion and distress at what happened to a wonderful human being and the most dedicated of public servants. She was murdered for what she believed, for the values she held, and for her effectiveness in campaigning for them. We do not in any circumstances ever want to witness a repeat of that.\u201d</p> <h2>On seeking an extension to article 50</h2> <p><strong>Ian Murray (Labour, Edinburgh South</strong><strong>):</strong> \u201cThe problem that the prime minister has is that nobody in this house trusts him. He has been asked five times this evening if he would abide by all the provisions of the European Union [Withdrawal] [No. 2] Act, and he refuses to answer the question. So for the sixth and final time: if he does not get a deal or a no deal through this house by 19 October, will he seek an extension to 31 January from the European Union?\u201d</p> <p><strong>Boris Johnson:</strong> \u201cNo.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Wednesday night\u2019s statement by Boris Johnson led to heated exchanges in the House of Commons around his use of inflammatory language. During the course of the debate the prime minister used the word \u201csurrender\u201d 13 times and said: \u201cWe will not betray the people who sent us here.\u201d Many MPs picked up on Johnson\u2019s language, saying it was irresponsible and unfitting. And the prime minister appeared to point-blank refuse to go to Brussels to get an article 50 extension if there was no deal by the end of October, as now required by law. Here are some of the key exchanges. On the prime minister\u2019s language Paula Sherriff (Labour, Dewsbury): \u201cI genuinely do not seek to stifle robust debate, but this evening the prime minister has continually used pejorative language to describe an act of parliament passed by this house. And I\u2019m sure you would agree, Mr Speaker, that we should not resort to using offensive, dangerous or inflammatory language for legislation that we do not like. \u201cAnd we stand here, Mr Speaker, under the shield of our departed friend [the murdered MP Jo Cox] with many of us in this place subject to death threats and abuse every single day. And let me tell the prime minister that they often quote his words, \u2018surrender\u2019, \u2018betrayal\u2019, \u2018traitor\u2019, and I for one am sick of it. And it has to come from the prime minister first. So I would be interested in hearing his opinion, he should be absolutely ashamed of himself.\u201d Boris Johnson (prime minister, Conservative, Uxbridge and South Ruislip): \u201cI think Mr Speaker, I have to tell you Mr Speaker, I have to say Mr Speaker, that I have never heard so much humbug in my life.\u201d On honouring Jo Cox\u2019s memory Tracy Brabin (Labour, Batley and Spen \u2013 Jo Cox\u2019s former constituency): \u201cHearing from the prime minister, words like \u2018the humiliation act\u2019, \u2018the surrender act\u2019, the capitulation act\u2019, all of these words are suggesting that because we disagree with him we are traitors, we are not patriots. Nothing could be further from the truth. Now, this may be a strategy to set the people against the establishment. I would like to gently suggest that he is the establishment and we are still people. As the woman who has taken over a seat that was left by our dear friend Jo Cox, can I ask him, in all honesty, as a human being, going forward, will he moderate his language so that we will all feel secure when going about our jobs.\u201d Boris Johnson: \u201cCan I say that the surest fire way \u2026 I think the \u2026 Of course there will be an attempt to obfuscate the effect of this act, but it does \u2026 the capitulation act or the surrender act, or whatever you want to call it. It does, it does, I\u2019m sorry but it greatly enfeebles this government\u2019s ability to negotiate. But what I will say is the best way to honour the memory and indeed the best way to bring this country together would be, I think, to get Brexit done.\u201d On populist rhetoric Caroline Lucas (Green, Brighton Pavillion): \u201cThe tone of the prime minister\u2019s speech was truly shocking, and if he recognises that tensions are inflamed, it is up to him not to stoke them further by whipping up hatred, treating parliament with contempt and dividing our country still further. This populist rhetoric is not only unfitting for a prime minister; it is genuinely and seriously dangerous.\u201d On the phrase \u2018surrender act\u2019 Ian Blackford (SNP, Ross, Skye and Lochaber): \u201cI hear the prime minister talking about a surrender act. How despicable that, when he refers to members of this house who are doing their duty to protect our constituents, he uses language such as \u2018surrender\u2019. That language is not suitable for the prime minister of any country.\u201d On MPs\u2019 families receiving death threats Anna Soubry (Independent Group for Change, Broxtowe): \u201cOn a point of order, Mr Speaker, I, too, am very sad that the prime minister has left, because I had hoped to raise this point of order to give him the opportunity to perhaps correct the record and reflect on his language and conduct in this house tonight. It gives me no pleasure to say that I am 62, I have been around and I have seen quite a lot of stuff in my life. It takes a lot to reduce this honourable member to tears. I am not alone tonight; there are others who I believe have left the estate, such has been their distress. \u201cI merely say to everybody in this place, but most notably to those who hold the highest of offices in this the most peculiar and extraordinary of political times, that the language that is used is incredibly important. Whatever side of the debate people are on, we have evidence that when they use words such as \u2018surrender\u2019 or \u2018capitulation\u2019, or others use the words \u2018traitor\u2019 and \u2018treason\u2019, there is a direct consequence. It means my mother receives a threat to her safety. It means my partner receives a death threat.\u201d Jo Swinson (Liberal Democrat leader, East Dunbartonshire): \u201cI fear that the public watching today will perhaps take the view that this house does not take sufficiently seriously threats of violence. Earlier today, we had the attorney general joke about wife beating. When asked whether they would bring forward the domestic abuse bill now that parliament has resumed, we had the government dismiss those requests, and we have had the comments that were made by the honourable member for Dewsbury [Paula Sherriff] recalling Jo Cox MP and the threats that MPs face on a daily basis \u2013 I may add that, today, I have reported to the police a threat against my child \u2013 and that was dismissed as humbug. This is a disgraceful state of affairs, and we must be able to find a way to conduct ourselves better.\u201d On the distress caused to Jo Cox\u2019s family Lucy Powell (Labour, Manchester Central): \u201cOn a point of order, Mr Speaker. I know that some of these points have been made already, but I just wanted to remind the house that Jo\u2019s murder did not happen in a vacuum. It happened in a context \u2013 a context that is not dissimilar to the context we find ourselves in today. I have heard from Jo\u2019s family this evening, and they have been very distressed by watching this place today. I know others have said it, but it has come from one side of the house: the language of \u2018surrender\u2019, of \u2018betrayal\u2019 and of \u2018capitulation\u2019. This is the kind of language and the context that led to the murder of an MP leaving her surgery of an evening in a small market town by somebody from the far right, and we cannot forget that context when we conduct ourselves. I just wanted to put that on the record.\u201d John Bercow (Speaker): \u201cThat point is duly noted. It is a very serious point. I do not want to add to it, but suffice it to say that although I do not know the Cox family anything like as well as the honourable lady or many other members here present, I do know members of the family. I have a strong empathy with the objectives of the Jo Cox Foundation, and indeed I am in touch with the family from time to time, including currently in relation to upcoming events, so I am not unsighted on the issues. I do not think any of us in this chamber will ever forget or entirely overcome our horror, revulsion and distress at what happened to a wonderful human being and the most dedicated of public servants. She was murdered for what she believed, for the values she held, and for her effectiveness in campaigning for them. We do not in any circumstances ever want to witness a repeat of that.\u201d On seeking an extension to article 50 Ian Murray (Labour, Edinburgh South): \u201cThe problem that the prime minister has is that nobody in this house trusts him. He has been asked five times this evening if he would abide by all the provisions of the European Union [Withdrawal] [No. 2] Act, and he refuses to answer the question. So for the sixth and final time: if he does not get a deal or a no deal through this house by 19 October, will he seek an extension to 31 January from the European Union?\u201d Boris Johnson: \u201cNo.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s our report from a lively encounter in Fukuoka. Thanks for reading along, and be sure to join Simon Burnton for England v USA. For now, it\u2019s arrivederci. So, Italy extend their lead at the top of Pool B, having scored 95 points in their first two matches. They might want to enjoy this view of the table, with South Africa and the All Blacks still to come. The Azzurri also have plenty of names among the top try and points scorers, with Tommaso Allan the first player to hit 20 points in Japan. And you can read more about the murky world of World Cup qualifying here: England v USA is up next \u2013 you can follow that one with Simon Burnton: Just enough time for Canada to restart, before a long old 80 minutes for them is finally brought to an end. Italy add a seventh try, with man of the match Jake Polledri bursting upfield, combining with Bellini before releasing Minozzi. Nobody in red is going to catch him. Canna misses the conversion, Italy just short of a half-century again. 76 minutes: Italy 43-7 Canada The underdogs try to get another score on the board, Hearn with a clever offload before Lesage runs into a sea of blue. Jordy Nelson\u2019s crossfield kick is sailing towards Ardron \u2013 but Minozzi, his leg heavily strapped, still gets across to deny Canada a second try. The Romania qualification row rumbles on ... Another rolling maul, more punishment for the Canadian forwards, and eventually, inevitably, Italy get over the line. It\u2019s the replacement prop, Federico Zani, with the score \u2013 and Carlo Canna adds the extras. 72 mins: So, Italy are getting their bonus point win, but Canada avoid going scoreless \u2013 and Coe has arguably just produced the individual moment of the match. Palazzani is on for Callum Braley at scrum-half for Italy. Oh my, this is sensational from Andrew Coe! He looks more like Sebastian Coe as he romps down the right flank, but with Bisegni looming at the line, he produces a lovely feint to sneak past him, and into the corner. Nelson nails a tricky conversion, too. 67 mins: Italy 36-0 Canada Jamie Mackenzie on for Gordon McCrorie at scrum-half for Canada. For Italy, Zani replaces Bigi and Carlo Canna takes over from Tommy Allan at fly-half. A clarification on Romania, from James in (you guessed it) Turkey. \u201cThey did qualify, but were disqualified for fielding an ineligible player. A Tonga-born player who had qualified for them on residency and played several tests was retrospectively found to have once played 7s for Tonga as a teenager. It was very harsh on Romania.\u201d NO TRY! Italy 36-0 Canada No! After checking with the TMO, Owens rules that the ball came off Lesage\u2019s forearm and went forward. Have some sympathy, Nigel. Canada 15 minutes away from the first zero of the tournament ... 64 mins: Lesage and Minozzi contest a high ball and the Canadian centre gets the bounce, with the ball looping into the arms of Tyler Ardron, who crosses over! Are Canada on the board here? A terrific, flowing attacking move from Italy, with Jake Polledri pivotal before the ball is worked left to Mattia Bellini, who skips past his man and races away to score! Allan misses the conversion, the first blot on his copybook. Ah, but the wing\u2019s hard work is undone by Matt Heaton, who went in low with a no-arms tackle in the buildup! It\u2019s a penalty try and a yellow card for Heaton, who\u2019s had a pretty dreadful day at the office. That wraps up a bonus point for Italy, too. For Canada, Andrew Coe comes on for Jeff Hassler. 59 mins: Italy 24-0 Canada An Italian maul rolls ominously for the line, but Van der Merwe does brilliantly to stop Luca Bigi from dotting down. Nigel Owens is having a word with the TMO, though ... 58 mins: Italy 24-0 Canada Eric Howard is replaced by Benoit Piffero for Canada, as Italy prepare to restart with a scrum ... 57 mins: Italy 24-0 Canada Ruzza makes a quick impact, breaking a tackle and tottering to within a few metres of the line after a penalty advantage. Nigel Owens has a stern word with Canada captain Ardron. \u201cHave a word with your team, and have a word with yourself, because you keep giving penalties away.\u201d Here\u2019s more on one of the World Cup\u2019s big talking points \u2013 how to help second-tier nations like Japan keep developing. 55 mins: Italy 24-0 Canada More quick feet from Minozzi in the back field \u2013 he\u2019s going to Wasps for the new season, and could light up the Premiership based on this form. Sisi goes off, replaced by Federico Ruzza. 54 mins: Italy 24-0 Canada Campagnaro and Hayward link up well as Italy once again target Canada\u2019s soft centre. They get a reprieve when David Sisi goes in off his feet \u2013 a rare lapse from the Italian pack today. 52 mins: Italy 24-0 Canada Front row changes: Quaglio and Riccioni on for Italy, replacing Lovotti and Ferrari. For Canada, Matt Tierney is replaced by Cole Keith. 50 mins: Italy 24-0 Canada A great tackle by Minozzi! Canada break upfield and look like they\u2019ll finally score, Jeff Hassler racing for the line \u2013 but the lightning-quick Italian wing gets across and buffets him into touch! 49 mins: Italy 24-0 Canada The commentary team are pondering whether Italy can beat South Africa in what will effectively be a quarter-final eliminator. It\u2019s a no from me. 48 mins: Italy 24-0 Canada Peter Nelson strips the ball to stop an Italian attack, but his kick is charged down and rebounds to a blue shirt. Nigel Owens whistles for offside, then gets a bit confused when trying to explain why to Braam Steyn. I\u2019d say a rare moment of comedy, but there have been a few today. 46 mins: Italy 24-0 Canada So after Canada spent 25 minutes trying to cut the deficit, Italy come back out and widen the gap with their first attack. Another Canadian attack falls down due to a handling error, Heaton spilling the ball under pressure. The pressure comes in waves, moving right to left, with Canada unable to slow things down and regroup. Eventually Sebastian Negri finds himself up against Nelson, who is physically outmatched and can\u2019t keep the flanker from going over. Allan adds the conversion, and Italy are surely out of sight. 42 mins: Italy 17-0 Canada Italy look refreshed after the break and charge into Canadian territory with substitute Mattia Bellini, on for Benvenuti, involved ... With dangerous tackles such a big talking point at the World Cup, the commentary team here note that yesterday, \u201cRowan\u2019s Law Day\u201d was observed in Canada. Rowan\u2019s Law is a set of concussion protocols brought in for Canadian youth matches, named after Rowan Stringer, a high school student who tragically died in 2013. Read more here. Here we go again ... There\u2019s another Europe v North America battle coming up later in Kobe. Here\u2019s Rob Kitson with the big match preview: Canada turn it over, thanks to great work from Mike Sheppard in the pack. They keep possession until the gong sounds for half time, then hoof it into touch. 39 mins: Italy 17-0 Canada The Canadian No 8 gets a hand on the ball, and is penalised for a deliberate knock on! Nigel Owens ponders a yellow card, but the TMO and touch judge talk him out of it. It\u2019s a penalty only, and Italy will keep the pressure on. Buydens can\u2019t continue, and is replaced by Djustice Sears-Duru (even better name). 38 mins: Italy 17-0 Canada A pivotal moment here, as Italy step up to within 10 metres. Another score here, and it\u2019s game over, but Canada hold firm on the line. Braley prepares to sweep the ball back, and Ardron charges out ... 37 mins: Italy 17-0 Canada A break as Canadian prop Hubert Buydens (great name) gets treatment. He plays for New Orleans in Major League Rugby, a new setup which is helping more Canadian and US players earn professional contracts. 36 mins: Italy 17-0 Canada An Italian scrum, which stops and starts and stops again, before Tyler Ardron is caught around a mile offside. Tommy Allan, who seems to be struggling with some kind of leg injury, will kick for the corner. 34 mins: Italy 17-0 Canada A scrappy spell as half-time approaches, as Italy creep out of their half and win a lineout. \u201cCanada a shadow of former selves,\u201d tweets Pnin Mogens. \u201cIs this the nature of 2nd/3rd tier international rugby? Have a golden generation peek above the parapet but no ongoing match schedule/funding means green shoots wither.\u201d Sadly, for plenty of teams, that\u2019s pretty much the size of it. Note that Romania \u2013 once also among the \u201cbest of the rest\u201d at World Cups \u2013 didn\u2019t even qualify. 30 mins: Italy 17-0 Canada Van der Merwe darts upfield and offloads to scrum-half McRorie, but Besigni makes a vital challenge and the move breaks down. Canada getting into plenty of good positions, but basic mistakes are letting them down \u2013 Italy must feel like they\u2019re playing themselves. 29 mins: Italy 17-0 Canada Another opening for Canada goes begging, with DTH Van der Merwe just failing to grasp an offload with a gap opening up in front of him. They\u2019ve really come back into this game, but have nothing to show for it. 27 mins: Italy 17-0 Canada An attacking lineout for Canada, from which space opens up on the right-hand side \u2013 they are getting some joy going wide \u2013 but an errant pass slows the move down, and they eventually knock on. 25 mins: Italy 17-0 Canada The Canadian defence coach is none other than former England scrum-half Richard Wigglesworth, who\u2019s out here gaining some coaching experience. Fair to say he\u2019s in at the deep end, here. 24 mins: Italy 17-0 Canada An injury break as Benvenuti and Canada\u2019s Conor Keys receive treatment \u2013 then as we restart, Canada break through the lively Ben Lesage. Braam Steyn gets across and squashes the move with a ferocious tackle. 22 mins: Italy 17-0 Canada Peter Nelson\u2019s crossfield kick puts Italy under pressure, with Hassler and Parfrey pressing the Italian backs. Campagnaro gets them out of trouble with a jinking run. 21 mins: Italy 17-0 Canada Heaton makes partial amends with a big tackle, but from a promising lineout, Canada hand the ball back to Italy. After an exchange of kicks, Van der Merwe collects Minozzi\u2019s undercooked effort ... 19 mins: Italy 17-0 Canada To be fair to Heaton \u2013 who, by the way, plays club rugby for Darlington Mowden Park \u2013 he wasn\u2019t helped by Ardron delaying the pass, making it more a touch more awkward for him. 17 mins: Italy 17-0 Canada Oh, Canada! After a spell of possession upfield, captain Tyler Ardron breaks a tackle and offloads to Heaton \u2013 but the ball squirms from the replacement\u2019s hands with the line in sight! Ah, what a shame. It was a howler, in truth. 15 mins: Italy 17-0 Canada The underdogs are currently missing a tackle per minute, and missing as many as they\u2019re making. Another change for Canada, with Lucas Rumball off, replaced by Matt Heaton. Rumball offers a one word, post-watershed assessment of Canada\u2019s performance as he trudges off. Yikes, this was very easy for Italy. A nice flowing move involving Campagnaro and Minozzi puts Canada on the back foot, and Dean Budd steps forward with the ball, Tierney completely misses his tackle and the captain steps through the gap. Allan adds the conversion. 11 mins: Italy 10-0 Canada So far, the Canadians look outmatched, and a brief wander upfield is easily repelled by Italy, who force a penalty. That\u2019s their third concession already. Italy, meanwhile, look more assured than they did against Namibia. 9 mins: Italy 10-0 Canada Early change for Canada, with centre Nick Blevins off after failing a head injury assessment. Ciaran Hearn, once of London Irish, comes on. It\u2019s an action replay of the first scrum, with Steyn snatching up the ball and powering for the line. This time, there\u2019s no stopping him \u2013 and Allan adds the conversion. 7 mins: Italy 3-0 Canada Canada have a lineout and a chance to clear their lines, but Eric Howard\u2019s throw is wonky, and now Italy have a scrum ... 6 mins: Italy 3-0 Canada Italy break into space through Jake Polledri, with the ball worked left towards Giulio Bisegni. With the try line in sight, he lets the ball slip through his hands! That\u2019s the execution O\u2019Shea was talking about. 4 mins: Italy 3-0 Canada This is the first game in Fukuoka, and there are concerns over the pitch already. That early scrum has churned up huge hunks of turf, which ground staff are hurriedly trying to replace. 2 mins: Italy 3-0 Canada Italian scrum, from which Braley feeds Braam Steyn. The No 8 tries to barrel over with brute strength, but Canada just about hold firm. Italy penalty, and they opt to take the three points, Tommaso Allan slotting the kick through the posts. 1 min: Ooh, Italy almost carve through their opponents immediately, with Minozzi\u2019s cute kick down the left flank chased by Callum Braley. Canada full-back Patrick Parfrey gets across and gets hands to the ball just in time! Italy, in a pleasing shade of blue, kick off. Canada, in red and white, collect. Nigel Owens is the man in the middle. Let\u2019s go! Time for the anthems! Come on, join in \u2013 you know these ones. Here\u2019s Italy head coach Conor O\u2019Shea, who wants his inexperienced team to be more clinical today. \u201cWe created 12, 13 try-scoring opportunities [against Namibia]. Seventeen guys played their first World Cup game last week, there\u2019s a few new more guys today. We\u2019re excited, we want to show lots of aggression, but focus on the execution. We cannot give Canada a sniff today.\u201d Anyone familiar with the Six Nations will know that for Italy, execution has been an issue for a long time. And here\u2019s more on Canada\u2019s golden era, as Martin Pengelly talks to Al Charron, part of a team that could conceivably have gone all the way to the final in 1991: Pre-game reading: Italy: Minozzi, Benvenuti, Campagnaro, Hayward, Bisegni, Allan, Braley; Lovotti, Bigi, Ferrari, Sisi, Budd, Negri, Polledri, Steyn. Replacements: Zani, Quaglio, Riccioni, Ruzza, Mbanda, Palazzani, Canna, Bellini. Canada: Parfrey, Hassler, Lesage, Blevins, Van der Merwe, Nelson, McCrorie; Buydens, Howard, Tierney, Keys, Larsen, Shepperd, Rumball, Ardron. Replacements: Piffero, Sears-Duru, Keith, Campbell, Heaton, Mackenzie, Hearn, Coe. For both these sides, the future hasn\u2019t been what they hoped. Canada reached the World Cup quarter-finals in 1991, and punched above their weight for the rest of the decade. As their era ended, Italy\u2019s began. The azzurri earned a place in the Six Nations, and two World Cup wins in 2003 continued the upward trajectory. Italy have plateaued since then, serving up two wins (and two losses) in every World Cup since, never escaping the pool stages and going backwards in the Six Nations. Canada, meanwhile, have careened downhill \u2013 they lost every game in 2015, and aren\u2019t hoping for much better in Japan. With New Zealand and South Africa also in Pool B, the best these two sides can realistically hope for is third place, and an automatic spot in 2023. They may not be the dark horses they once were, but a World Cup win is a World Cup win. Just ask Uruguay. Kick-off is at 4.45pm local time, 8.45am BST.",

      "body": "<p>This time Fiorentina did not blow it. You could forgive supporters at the Stadio Artemio Franchi for thinking they were about to, when Sampdoria\u2019s Federico Bonazzoli forced the ball into their net in the 79th minute of Wednesday\u2019s game. Fiorentina had been 2-0 up and cruising: exactly as they were at the corresponding point of what became a 2-2 draw against Atalanta three days before.</p> \n<p>The <em>Viola</em> were established experts in finding ways not to win. They had not tasted victory in Serie A for 220 days \u2013 since beating Spal on 17 February. Not since 2018 had they taken three points from a home game.</p> \n<p>Under normal circumstances, you might expect the mood to be mutinous. And yet, the opposite was true. The stands of the Franchi were heaving, the club having posted their best season-ticket sales in at least 18 years. Only the two Milanese clubs have shifted more for this campaign.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/25/european-round-up-psg-stunned-at-home-by-reims-as-real-madrid-go-top\">European round-up: PSG stunned at home by Reims as Real Madrid go top</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Such is the enthusiasm that comes with a fresh start. Fiorentina were taken over this summer by Rocco Commisso, the billionaire founder of the American cable network Mediacom. His arrival was immediately welcomed by fans who had grown disillusioned with the previous owners, the Della Valle family, and his popularity has only continued to grow since.</p> \n<p>Commisso has cast himself as a man of action, arguing that he has no time to waste at 69 years old. The grandest of his stated ambitions are to build a new stadium and construct a team to compete with Juventus. For his first summer at the helm, it was enough to deliver a more straightforward promise: that Federico Chiesa would not be sold, \u201ceven for $100,000,000\u201d.</p> \n<p>Instead of letting their greatest young talent walk out the door, Fiorentina signed an old hand to help guide him. The capture of Franck Rib\u00e9ry on a free transfer was the most unexpected move of the Italian transfer window. Already, it looks like one of the best.</p> \n<p>Rib\u00e9ry\u2019s arrival ignited the imaginations of Fiorentina\u2019s supporters. A crowd of 10,000 came to see him unveiled at the Franchi. He stepped off his plane at Peretola airport speaking fluent Italian and explaining that Luca Toni \u2013 an icon in Florence, and his good friend from their time together at Bayern Munich \u2013 had told him to come.</p> \n<p>Still, it was valid to wonder how much he had left in the tank at 36. Rib\u00e9ry took a significant pay cut to join, and jokingly described himself as a free lottery ticket. In reality, the wages on his two-year contract are understood to be more than double those paid to Chiesa \u2013 previously the club\u2019s highest earner.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8690704d56ba4811cded753762625295cc4ef6af\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8690704d56ba4811cded753762625295cc4ef6af/0_0_3072_2079/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Federico Chiesa celebrates after scoring.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"677\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Federico Chiesa celebrates after scoring.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Claudio Giovannini/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It has not taken long for Rib\u00e9ry to start justifying his cost. His first appearance was only a 12-minute cameo off the bench against Napoli, but ought to have yielded a penalty when he was dragged down by Elseid Hysaj after tormenting the defender. Next came a 0-0 draw with Juventus in which Rib\u00e9ry not only outperformed Cristiano Ronaldo but at one point raced back into his own half to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/16/after-552-days-juventus-finally-knocked-off-their-serie-a-perch\">steal the ball off the Portuguese\u2019s toes</a>. Rib\u00e9ry followed up by scoring his first goal for Fiorentina in Sunday\u2019s aforementioned draw with Atalanta.</p> \n<p>The cross had come from Chiesa, floated beautifully from right touch-line into Rib\u00e9ry\u2019s path as he attacked the penalty box on the far side. The Frenchman dispatched it first-time into the bottom corner off his left boot.</p> \n<p>Those same players inspired their team to victory on Wednesday. Rib\u00e9ry created Fiorentina\u2019s first goal, turning Gianluca Caprari inside-out before teeing up Germ\u00e1n Pezzella for a close-range header. Chiesa made it 2-0 just before the hour, running on to Dalbert\u2019s smart flick and curling a shot past Emil Audero.</p> \n<p>Many have questioned the work of the Fiorentina manager, Vincenzo Montella, since he returned to the club in April, and Wednesday\u2019s win is unlikely to appease his critics. Fiorentina continue to look brittle, and Bonazzoli\u2019s goal made for an anxious finish against opponents who had been playing with 10 men from the 54th minute. Here, too, Fiorentina were fortunate; Jeison Murillo\u2019s second booking was \u201cearned\u201d by a blatant dive from Gaetano Castrovilli.</p> \n<p>But Montella has concocted a compelling idea, pairing Chiesa and Rib\u00e9ry as dual false nines at the top of a 3-5-2. These are still early days, but Sampdoria\u2019s defenders, like Atalanta\u2019s, were flummoxed at times by their movement.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfo8N8tAzM4\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Cfo8N8tAzM4?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The likelihood is that Fiorentina will not achieve the target Rib\u00e9ry set for them on his arrival, of finishing in the top three. But he also indicated an eagerness to serve as a mentor to a team stacked with young talent. Five of Fiorentina\u2019s starters on Wednesday were 22 or younger, and so were another two deployed off the bench.</p> \n<p>One of Commisso\u2019s first acts after completing his purchase of Fiorentina was to re-hire Daniele Prad\u00e8 as the club\u2019s sporting director, a role he had filled from 2012-16 \u2013 during which time the club achieved three consecutive fourth-place finishes and reached a Europa League semi-final. In turn, one of Prad\u00e8\u2019s first calls was to Toni, who recommended him to sign Rib\u00e9ry.</p> \n<p>\u201cI told him it was impossible,\u201d said Prad\u00e8, \u201cbut we kept talking and I started to think it could be the right thing. I spoke to Rib\u00e9ry on 25 June and I fell in love with him \u2026 he brings this charisma with him, the essence of winning.\u201d</p> \n<p>That final line might have been the most important one, for a team that had forgotten how it was done.</p> \n<h2>Talking points</h2> \n<p>\u2022 A fifth game, and a fifth win in Serie A for Antonio Conte\u2019s Inter. They rode their luck and relied on Samir Handanovic\u2019s saves at times against Lazio. Still, this was a tough fixture, four days after a derby, and Inter kept their fourth clean sheet of the season. Throw in the European let-down, and it really does all feel very classic Conte.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Kalidou Koulibaly\u2019s season continues to veer between highs and lows. He was sent off for protesting too vehemently after Lucas Castro scored a late winner for Cagliari at Napoli, and may be out for a few games depending on the referee Marco Di Bello\u2019s report. Koulibaly\u2019s reaction may reflect some measure of the tension felt already to keep up with the leaders.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1176962916823851009\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83d\ude2e LATE DRAMA AT THE SAN PAOLO!<br><br>\u26bd Lucas Castro scores for Cagliari, and it's completely against the run of play!<br><br>\ud83d\udd34 To make matters worse, Koulibaly was sent off for Napoli in the aftermath too! <a href=\"https://t.co/dnEcWXyHfN\">pic.twitter.com/dnEcWXyHfN</a></p>\u2014 Premier Sports \ud83d\udcfa (@PremierSportsTV) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1176962916823851009?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 25, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>\u2022 Juventus had to come back from a goal down for a second game running. They were good enough value for their win by the end but I really like this Brescia team, with Sandro Tonali pulling the strings and Alfred Donnarumma taking his one chance (four goals this season already). Less encouraging, for me, was Mario Balotelli\u2019s performance in his first game for his hometown club.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Chris Smalling\u2019s Roma debut started well, even if he did miss one very presentable chance to score from a set-piece, and by the second half he had talking heads in Italy <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AleAntinelli/status/1176925027784167424\">comparing him to a luxury car</a>.

      "bodyText": "This time Fiorentina did not blow it. You could forgive supporters at the Stadio Artemio Franchi for thinking they were about to, when Sampdoria\u2019s Federico Bonazzoli forced the ball into their net in the 79th minute of Wednesday\u2019s game. Fiorentina had been 2-0 up and cruising: exactly as they were at the corresponding point of what became a 2-2 draw against Atalanta three days before. The Viola were established experts in finding ways not to win. They had not tasted victory in Serie A for 220 days \u2013 since beating Spal on 17 February. Not since 2018 had they taken three points from a home game. Under normal circumstances, you might expect the mood to be mutinous. And yet, the opposite was true. The stands of the Franchi were heaving, the club having posted their best season-ticket sales in at least 18 years. Only the two Milanese clubs have shifted more for this campaign. Such is the enthusiasm that comes with a fresh start. Fiorentina were taken over this summer by Rocco Commisso, the billionaire founder of the American cable network Mediacom. His arrival was immediately welcomed by fans who had grown disillusioned with the previous owners, the Della Valle family, and his popularity has only continued to grow since. Commisso has cast himself as a man of action, arguing that he has no time to waste at 69 years old. The grandest of his stated ambitions are to build a new stadium and construct a team to compete with Juventus. For his first summer at the helm, it was enough to deliver a more straightforward promise: that Federico Chiesa would not be sold, \u201ceven for $100,000,000\u201d. Instead of letting their greatest young talent walk out the door, Fiorentina signed an old hand to help guide him. The capture of Franck Rib\u00e9ry on a free transfer was the most unexpected move of the Italian transfer window. Already, it looks like one of the best. Rib\u00e9ry\u2019s arrival ignited the imaginations of Fiorentina\u2019s supporters. A crowd of 10,000 came to see him unveiled at the Franchi. He stepped off his plane at Peretola airport speaking fluent Italian and explaining that Luca Toni \u2013 an icon in Florence, and his good friend from their time together at Bayern Munich \u2013 had told him to come. Still, it was valid to wonder how much he had left in the tank at 36. Rib\u00e9ry took a significant pay cut to join, and jokingly described himself as a free lottery ticket. In reality, the wages on his two-year contract are understood to be more than double those paid to Chiesa \u2013 previously the club\u2019s highest earner. It has not taken long for Rib\u00e9ry to start justifying his cost. His first appearance was only a 12-minute cameo off the bench against Napoli, but ought to have yielded a penalty when he was dragged down by Elseid Hysaj after tormenting the defender. Next came a 0-0 draw with Juventus in which Rib\u00e9ry not only outperformed Cristiano Ronaldo but at one point raced back into his own half to steal the ball off the Portuguese\u2019s toes. Rib\u00e9ry followed up by scoring his first goal for Fiorentina in Sunday\u2019s aforementioned draw with Atalanta. The cross had come from Chiesa, floated beautifully from right touch-line into Rib\u00e9ry\u2019s path as he attacked the penalty box on the far side. The Frenchman dispatched it first-time into the bottom corner off his left boot. Those same players inspired their team to victory on Wednesday. Rib\u00e9ry created Fiorentina\u2019s first goal, turning Gianluca Caprari inside-out before teeing up Germ\u00e1n Pezzella for a close-range header. Chiesa made it 2-0 just before the hour, running on to Dalbert\u2019s smart flick and curling a shot past Emil Audero. Many have questioned the work of the Fiorentina manager, Vincenzo Montella, since he returned to the club in April, and Wednesday\u2019s win is unlikely to appease his critics. Fiorentina continue to look brittle, and Bonazzoli\u2019s goal made for an anxious finish against opponents who had been playing with 10 men from the 54th minute. Here, too, Fiorentina were fortunate; Jeison Murillo\u2019s second booking was \u201cearned\u201d by a blatant dive from Gaetano Castrovilli. But Montella has concocted a compelling idea, pairing Chiesa and Rib\u00e9ry as dual false nines at the top of a 3-5-2. These are still early days, but Sampdoria\u2019s defenders, like Atalanta\u2019s, were flummoxed at times by their movement. The likelihood is that Fiorentina will not achieve the target Rib\u00e9ry set for them on his arrival, of finishing in the top three. But he also indicated an eagerness to serve as a mentor to a team stacked with young talent. Five of Fiorentina\u2019s starters on Wednesday were 22 or younger, and so were another two deployed off the bench. One of Commisso\u2019s first acts after completing his purchase of Fiorentina was to re-hire Daniele Prad\u00e8 as the club\u2019s sporting director, a role he had filled from 2012-16 \u2013 during which time the club achieved three consecutive fourth-place finishes and reached a Europa League semi-final. In turn, one of Prad\u00e8\u2019s first calls was to Toni, who recommended him to sign Rib\u00e9ry. \u201cI told him it was impossible,\u201d said Prad\u00e8, \u201cbut we kept talking and I started to think it could be the right thing. I spoke to Rib\u00e9ry on 25 June and I fell in love with him \u2026 he brings this charisma with him, the essence of winning.\u201d That final line might have been the most important one, for a team that had forgotten how it was done. Talking points \u2022 A fifth game, and a fifth win in Serie A for Antonio Conte\u2019s Inter. They rode their luck and relied on Samir Handanovic\u2019s saves at times against Lazio. Still, this was a tough fixture, four days after a derby, and Inter kept their fourth clean sheet of the season. Throw in the European let-down, and it really does all feel very classic Conte. \u2022 Kalidou Koulibaly\u2019s season continues to veer between highs and lows. He was sent off for protesting too vehemently after Lucas Castro scored a late winner for Cagliari at Napoli, and may be out for a few games depending on the referee Marco Di Bello\u2019s report. Koulibaly\u2019s reaction may reflect some measure of the tension felt already to keep up with the leaders. \u2022 Juventus had to come back from a goal down for a second game running. They were good enough value for their win by the end but I really like this Brescia team, with Sandro Tonali pulling the strings and Alfred Donnarumma taking his one chance (four goals this season already). Less encouraging, for me, was Mario Balotelli\u2019s performance in his first game for his hometown club. \u2022 Chris Smalling\u2019s Roma debut started well, even if he did miss one very presentable chance to score from a set-piece, and by the second half he had talking heads in Italy comparing him to a luxury car. Although the game turned, he was not the chief culprit for either goal Atalanta scored.",

      "bodyText": "Subscribe now to receive the morning briefing by email. Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. Impeachment poses dangers to Trump and Democrats In an apparent attempt to have the first word in a looming impeachment inquiry, the White House released a memo on Wednesday detailing Donald Trump\u2019s phone call in July with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in which he pressed the Ukrainian president to investigate his Democratic presidential rival Joe Biden, and appeared to tie the request to US aid for Ukraine. Trump also attacked the anonymous intelligence official responsible for bringing the conversation to light, a move intended to dissuade future whistleblowers. Risky business. Trump\u2019s aura of invincibility at last appears to have been dented, writes Tom McCarthy. But, as Lauren Gambino reports, the impeachment process also carries risks for the Democrats. Unintended comedy. Trump came face to face with a seemingly bewildered Zelenskiy at the UN general assembly in New York, where the two former TV stars met on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the White House mistakenly emailed its talking points on the scandal to Democratic leaders. Fired EPA scientists to reconvene in snub to Trump An advisory panel of 20 air pollution scientists dismissed from the Environmental Protection Agency by the Trump administration intends to reconvene and continue its work outside government, assembling at a Washington DC hotel a year to the day since its official disbandment. The Guardian has learned Trump\u2019s pick to lead the Fish and Wildlife Service, Aurelia Skipwith, has ties to agricultural groups opposed to protections for endangered species. Indigenous representative. An indigenous representative has addressed the UN climate summit in a formal capacity for the first time. Tuntiak Katan of the Ecuadorian Shuar people told the event indigenous peoples \u201cprotect 80% of the world\u2019s biodiversity\u201d. Climate deniers. A group of Australian mining engineers and business figures has signed up to a declaration claiming \u201cthere is no climate emergency\u201d and insisting \u201cCO2 is plant food\u201d. LA police enabled Ed Buck by \u2018ignoring gay black men\u2019 Ed Buck, a prominent Los Angeles political activist who stands accused of forcibly injecting black gay men with fatal doses of methamphetamine, got away with his crimes because the police ignored evidence and the testimony of the black gay men who spoke up, the mother of one of his victims has claimed. LaTisha Nixon\u2019s 26-year-old son, Gemmel Moore, died from an overdose at Buck\u2019s West Hollywood apartment in July 2017. \u201cI\u2019m a grieving mother, but [law enforcement treated us like criminals,\u201d she said. \u2018Violent predator\u2019. Buck, 65, was arrested last week. Prosecutors called him a \u201cviolent sexual predator\u201d who had at least 11 victims, two of whom died, including Timothy Dean, who had a fatal overdose at Buck\u2019s home in January. Boris Johnson urged to calm \u2018inferno of rhetoric\u2019 British MPs on the left and right have urged the prime minister, Boris Johnson, to temper his rhetoric over Brexit after an acrimonious return to the House of Commons on Wednesday. Following the UK supreme court\u2019s ruling that the prime minister\u2019s advice to the Queen to suspend parliament was unlawful, an unrepentant Johnson dismissed the suggestion his use of inflammatory language such as \u201csurrender\u201d and \u201cbetrayal\u201d was dangerous as \u201chumbug\u201d. Jo Cox. Johnson drew gasps of shock in the Commons when he referred to the Labour MP Jo Cox, an ardent remainer murdered in the run-up to the Brexit vote in 2016. Johnson claimed the best way to honour Cox\u2019s memory was to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d. Cheat sheet Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Imran Khan, has said he is trying to draw international attention to the danger of war breaking out between his country and India, which both have nuclear weapons, over the disputed territory of Kashmir. Israel\u2019s president, Reuven Rivlin, has asked Benjamin Netanyahu to try to form a coalition government, in an effort to break the deadlock between the incumbent prime minister and opposition leader Benny Gantz, after the country\u2019s inconclusive election. Elizabeth Warren has topped a national poll of Democratic presidential candidates for the first time, in a Quinnipiac survey that puts the Massachusetts senator on 27% to Biden\u2019s 25%, with Bernie Sanders trailing on 16%. Samuel L Jackson has signed up to be the first celebrity voice of Alexa, Amazon\u2019s virtual personal assistant, allowing users to interact with an AI version of the Pulp Fiction star, developed using the company\u2019s neural text-to-speech technology. Must-reads Zero stars for Zeroville, the worst film of 2019 James Franco had directed several little-seen literary adaptations, including two based onbooks by William Faulkner, before tackling the dense Hollywood novel Zeroville in 2014. Finally released on three US screens this month, his film version is \u201ca work of rarefied and powerful badness,\u201d says Charles Bramesco. Life as a cancer patient When Anne Boyer was diagnosed with highly aggressive breast cancer, she was offered a cure so poisonous that, if she survived, she could lose her eyesight, speech and memory. \u201cMy body feels like it is dying as a side-effect of what is promised to keep it alive,\u201d she writes. Buttigieg faces new criticism from South Bend\u2019s black leaders The South Bend mayor, Pete Buttigieg, was the rising star of the Democratic presidential primary, until his progress was hindered by the fallout from a police shooting in his city in March. Now, he is again being criticised by some of the city\u2019s black leaders over policing-related controversies, as Tom Perkins reports. Trudeau\u2019s poor constituents \u2018pushed out\u2019 by development As if Justin Trudeau were not facing enough controversy on the national stage, trouble is brewing in his Montreal constituency, too. Parc-Extension is one of the poorest neighbourhoods in Canada. Now, writes Flavie Halais, some fear a new C$348m ($263m) university campus will gentrify the district beyond recognition. Opinion Women still earn less than men, but the work environment is changing slowly for the better, says Gene Marks. And nothing sends that message more clearly than a survey that found 42% of US businesses are owned by women. In what could be a response to lower pay at their place of employment, more women than ever \u2013 particularly women of color \u2013 are also starting up side businesses. Sport England\u2019s plan for their Rugby World Cup tie against the USA in Japan on Thursday is to get the job done as simply and effectively as possible. But the Eagles, featuring several seasoned pros such as Joe Taufete\u2019e, will not necessarily make it easy for them, says Robert Kitson. The former New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski recently claimed to have ameliorated his CTE \u2013 a result of the 20 concussions he received while playing \u2013 using CBD products. But he was dangerously wrong to suggest the condition is \u201cfixable\u201d, says Ian McMahan. Sign up The US morning briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.

      "bodyText": "The former French president Jacques Chirac, a self-styled affable rogue who had one of the longest political careers in Europe, has died aged 86. For several years he had suffered from memory loss said to be linked to a form of Alzheimer\u2019s disease or to the minor stroke that he had while in office. Chirac, who was head of state from 1995 to 2007, boasted one of the longest continuous political careers in Europe \u2013 twice president, twice prime minister and 18 years as mayor of Paris. Although his time as president was marked by inaction and political stagnation, and despite having left France just as divided and struggling with mounting debt, inequalities and unemployment as he had found it, his debonair persona meant that in retirement he was embraced as one of France\u2019s favourite politicians. Chirac will be remembered internationally for leading France\u2019s strong opposition to the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, when approval ratings for his anti-war stance in France soared to 90%. \u201cWar is always a last resort. It is always proof of failure. It is always the worst of solutions, because it brings death and misery,\u201d he said a week before the US-led coalition forces invaded Iraq. He warned that any occupation of Iraq would prove a \u201cnightmare\u201d. One of Chirac\u2019s greatest gestures at home was to reconcile the nation with its history by acknowledging that France as a whole was responsible for the roundup of some 76,000 Jews sent to Nazi death camps during the second world war. His vow that the \u201ccriminal folly\u201d of the German occupation was \u201cassisted by the French people, by the French state\u201d lifted the last taboo of the occupation and the collaborationist Vichy regime. His apology was the first time a postwar French head of state had fully acknowledged France\u2019s role. Chirac will be remembered above all as a master in the art of political seduction. For decades he charmed the public with his endless handshaking, patting of cows\u2019 backsides and shaking of dogs\u2019 paws on his tours round France \u2013 a beer-drinking, Gitanes-smoking man of the people who was able to eat five lunches in one afternoon on the election trail. He shook so many hands while criss-crossing France that he used to plunge his fingers into a bucket of ice at the end of the day or wear plasters to protect from the blisters he got from his powerful grip on pensioners and farmers. He had a visceral need to reach out and touch people \u2013 whether it was hugging an elderly voter or flamboyantly kissing the hand of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. Chirac was much mocked, often satirised and once nicknamed \u201cSuperliar\u201d. After a historic trial in 2011, he became the first former president to be convicted of corruption following embezzlement charges in a party funding scandal when he was mayor of Paris. Yet he was seen to embody the French president\u2019s role as republican monarch with a kind of panache that Nicolas Sarkozy and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande would later be found by the public to be lacking. Politically he was known as the \u201cweathervane\u201d, for his ability to shift as it suited him. He went from championing state control in the 1970s to Ronald Reagan\u2019s free-market liberalism in the 1980s. When he was elected president in 1995, he shocked the world by resuming nuclear testing in atoll explosions in the South Pacific, then took to the stage as an eco-champion at the 2002 Earth summit, warning: \u201cOur house is burning while we look elsewhere.\u201d He went from virulent eurosceptic in the late 1970s to staunch euro-defender 10 years later. During more than 43 years in politics, Chirac was described as a \u201cbulldozer\u201d and \u201ckiller\u201d of rivals.

      "body": "<p>\u201cThat morning, Jim Sams, clever but by no means profound, woke from uneasy dreams to find himself transformed into a gigantic creature.\u201d Ian McEwan\u2019s enjoyable, cockeyed Brexit satire opens by tipping a gigantic wink to Kafka\u2019s <em>Metamorphosis</em>, a work it in no way resembles. The set up is that a cockroach wakes up in No 10 after a big night, finds it is a hungover and very Boris-like prime minister, and, once it gets used to the unpleasant feeling of having an internal skeleton and a fleshy tongue in its mouth, sets about steering the UK into a popularly acclaimed national disaster.

      "bodyText": "\u201cThat morning, Jim Sams, clever but by no means profound, woke from uneasy dreams to find himself transformed into a gigantic creature.\u201d Ian McEwan\u2019s enjoyable, cockeyed Brexit satire opens by tipping a gigantic wink to Kafka\u2019s Metamorphosis, a work it in no way resembles. The set up is that a cockroach wakes up in No 10 after a big night, finds it is a hungover and very Boris-like prime minister, and, once it gets used to the unpleasant feeling of having an internal skeleton and a fleshy tongue in its mouth, sets about steering the UK into a popularly acclaimed national disaster. The bug is helped by the intuitive discovery \u2013 something to do with the pheromonal cockroach hivemind, I guess \u2013 that most of the cabinet are also now secretly cockroaches. Kafka\u2019s opening premise looks as though it wants to be a dream-image, a metaphor or an allegory, but the story then works through it with a dismayingly fastidious realism. McEwan makes a great deal of the reversal itself, but then doesn\u2019t always tie it in to the subsequent action. In fact, Swift is the more obvious ancestor here \u2013 with much the best and funniest idea in the book being the Swiftian absurdity of the national project that stands in for Brexit. \u201cReversalism\u201d, which Jim Sams champions on a \u201cdo or die\u201d basis, is an unorthodox economic theory.

Though far from impossible, a repeat of April\u2019s high turnout seems unlikely. And what neither the socialists nor Unidas Podemos seemed to take seriously in their negotiations is that these feelings were stronger among leftwing voters than those on the right. This could be a big problem for the socialists, as they were especially effective at mobilising voters who had abstained in previous elections, by adopting more leftwing rhetoric and emphasising the threat of a resurgent far right.</p> <p>To understand Spain\u2019s increasingly fragmentary politics, you have to go back to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/15/spain-15-m-movement-activism\" title=\"\"><em>indignados</em> movement</a> that erupted in May 2011. At a time of austerity, massive unemployment, widespread evictions and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/mar/01/spain-watergate-corruption-scandal-politics-gurtel-case\" title=\"\">high-profile corruption scandals</a>, hundreds of thousands occupied public squares throughout the country. Chanting \u201c<em>No nos representan</em>\u201d (\u201cThey don\u2019t represent us\u201d) and demanding \u201creal democracy now\u201d, they often criticised the system that emerged from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_transition_to_democracy\" title=\"\">La Transici\u00f3n</a> \u2013 the country\u2019s transition from dictatorship to democracy in the late 1970s \u2013 as an inauthentic <em>partitocracia</em> (\u201cpartocracy\u201d) designed to protect the two mainstream parties and accommodate members of the old regime.</p> <p>As the establishment parties routinely ignored the indignados<em>\u2019</em> demands for more direct participation, social rights and economic democracy \u2013 many of which were supported by an overwhelming majority of citizens \u2013 new parties emerged at the local, regional and state levels to capitalise on the movement\u2019s discourse.</p> <p>The process continues. This weekend, it was announced that M\u00e1s Madrid, the new party led by \u00cd\u00f1igo Errej\u00f3n, a founding member of Podemos, will run in the election. By emphasising feminism, ecosocialism and political participation, the party hopes to mobilise those disenchanted by the sad spectacle of the last few months. Yet many fear this will just divide the left further, even paving the way for a rightwing government.</p> <p>Unlike the politicians who represent them, Spanish voters welcome a pluralistic form of politics. According to the El Pa\u00eds poll, just 16% of Spaniards are in favour of a return to the de facto two-party system that emerged from La Transici\u00f3n. By contrast, 84% believe the parties must deal with the new multiparty system and grow accustomed to reaching agreements.</p> <p>Indeed, over the last two decades, the country has become much more diverse, both in terms of its political views and its demographic composition. At the same time, a broad consensus has emerged in favour of more direct and binding political participation \u2013 through participatory budgets, citizen-initiated legislation and referenda \u2013 as well as affordable housing, universal health care, and greater transparency and accountability. But as the parliament has become somewhat more \u201crepresentative\u201d of the population\u2019s demands, party politics has become more susceptible to blockage. The November election is only the latest evidence of the existing political institutions\u2019 failure to deal with an electorate that is outgrowing them.</p> <p>The indignados pointed this problem out eight years ago: their radical critique of representative democracy is just as relevant today. It is time for the demand at the heart of their movement, the demand for more direct participation that can bypass the impasses of party politics, to finally be taken seriously.</p> <p>\u2022 Carlos Delcl\u00f3s is a sociologist and associate researcher at the Barcelona Centre for International Affairs (CIDOB).

Chanting \u201cNo nos representan\u201d (\u201cThey don\u2019t represent us\u201d) and demanding \u201creal democracy now\u201d, they often criticised the system that emerged from La Transici\u00f3n \u2013 the country\u2019s transition from dictatorship to democracy in the late 1970s \u2013 as an inauthentic partitocracia (\u201cpartocracy\u201d) designed to protect the two mainstream parties and accommodate members of the old regime. As the establishment parties routinely ignored the indignados\u2019 demands for more direct participation, social rights and economic democracy \u2013 many of which were supported by an overwhelming majority of citizens \u2013 new parties emerged at the local, regional and state levels to capitalise on the movement\u2019s discourse. The process continues. This weekend, it was announced that M\u00e1s Madrid, the new party led by \u00cd\u00f1igo Errej\u00f3n, a founding member of Podemos, will run in the election. By emphasising feminism, ecosocialism and political participation, the party hopes to mobilise those disenchanted by the sad spectacle of the last few months. Yet many fear this will just divide the left further, even paving the way for a rightwing government. Unlike the politicians who represent them, Spanish voters welcome a pluralistic form of politics. According to the El Pa\u00eds poll, just 16% of Spaniards are in favour of a return to the de facto two-party system that emerged from La Transici\u00f3n. By contrast, 84% believe the parties must deal with the new multiparty system and grow accustomed to reaching agreements. Indeed, over the last two decades, the country has become much more diverse, both in terms of its political views and its demographic composition. At the same time, a broad consensus has emerged in favour of more direct and binding political participation \u2013 through participatory budgets, citizen-initiated legislation and referenda \u2013 as well as affordable housing, universal health care, and greater transparency and accountability. But as the parliament has become somewhat more \u201crepresentative\u201d of the population\u2019s demands, party politics has become more susceptible to blockage. The November election is only the latest evidence of the existing political institutions\u2019 failure to deal with an electorate that is outgrowing them. The indignados pointed this problem out eight years ago: their radical critique of representative democracy is just as relevant today. It is time for the demand at the heart of their movement, the demand for more direct participation that can bypass the impasses of party politics, to finally be taken seriously. \u2022 Carlos Delcl\u00f3s is a sociologist and associate researcher at the Barcelona Centre for International Affairs (CIDOB).

This is a \u201cregulated asset base\u201d (RAB) model. Under RAB, consumers would start to pay for a plant before it is built but the electricity at the end would be cheaper.

But if the electricity were to be substantially cheaper than Hinkley\u2019s, there might be a deal to be done if more nuclear-generated power is deemed essential for baseload supplies.</p> <p>But there are two reasons to be cautious. First, note the warning of the National Infrastructure Commission <a href=\"https://www.nic.org.uk/assessment/national-infrastructure-assessment/low-cost-low-carbon/\">in a report last year</a>: \u201cThere is limited experience of using the RAB model for anything as complex or as risky as nuclear.\u201d</p> <p>Second, EDF\u2019s latest estimate for Hinkley may not be its last. Every upwards revision weakens the case for RAB \u2013 and the argument was already in borderline territory.</p> <h2>M&amp;G boss manages to rise above</h2> <p>The asset manager M&amp;G, demerging from the Prudential, is coming to the FTSE 100 index soon. Like all shiny-faced newcomers, it wants to show it is playing fair with executive pensions. Thus boss John Foley\u2019s pension contribution has been cut from 25% of salary to 13%, in line with the workforce.</p> <p>Luckily for Foley, however, his basic salary has been increased from \u00a3781,000 in 2018 to \u00a3980,000, which more than compensates for the pension change. Solidarity should not prove too irksome.</p>",

First, note the warning of the National Infrastructure Commission in a report last year: \u201cThere is limited experience of using the RAB model for anything as complex or as risky as nuclear.\u201d Second, EDF\u2019s latest estimate for Hinkley may not be its last. Every upwards revision weakens the case for RAB \u2013 and the argument was already in borderline territory. M&amp;G boss manages to rise above The asset manager M&amp;G, demerging from the Prudential, is coming to the FTSE 100 index soon. Like all shiny-faced newcomers, it wants to show it is playing fair with executive pensions. Thus boss John Foley\u2019s pension contribution has been cut from 25% of salary to 13%, in line with the workforce. Luckily for Foley, however, his basic salary has been increased from \u00a3781,000 in 2018 to \u00a3980,000, which more than compensates for the pension change. Solidarity should not prove too irksome.",

Disney co-chair Alan Horn said: \u201cWith the close of the Skywalker Saga, [Kennedy] is pursuing a new era in Star Wars storytelling, and knowing what a diehard fan Kevin [Feige] is, it made sense for these two extraordinary producers to work on a Star Wars film together.\u201d</p> <p>No details have been revealed as to the nature of the project, or whether it will operate as part of the \u201cmain\u201d chronological narrative or as a standalone \u201canthology\u201d film. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, due for release in December, is the ninth and final part of the \u201cSkywalker Saga\u201d; Lucasfilm have previously made agreements with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/06/game-of-thrones-star-wars-films\">Game of Thrones creators David Benioff and DB Weiss</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/nov/09/disney-new-star-wars-trilogy-live-action-tv-series\">The Last Jedi director Rian Johnson</a> to make separate trilogies.</p> <p>However, Lucasfilm have experienced considerable hiccups in maintaining the Star Wars franchise since the triumphant release of Star Wars: The Force Awakens in 2015. A series of directors have been replaced or sidelined: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2016/dec/19/rogue-one-star-wars-reshoots-trailers\">Tony Gilroy took over from Gareth Edwards</a> on Rogue One, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/05/star-wars-episode-ix-colin-trevorrow\">Colin Trevorrow</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jun/21/star-wars-han-solo-spin-off-directors-fired-after-creative-differences\">director team Phil Lord and Chris Miller</a> were replaced on The Rise of Skywalker and Solo: A Star Wars Story respectively. Disney CEO Bob Iger also admitted that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/04/star-wars-trolls-solo-box-office-ron-howard\">Solo\u2019s disappointing box office results were partly due to \u201cfranchise fatigue\u201d</a>, when the film was released only six months after The Last Jedi.</p> <p>Since 2008, the 23 films that Feige has produced as part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe <a href=\"https://www.boxofficemojo.com/franchises/chart/?id=avengers.htm\">have grossed over $22.5bn (\u00a318.2bn) worldwide</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige \u2013 generally acknowledged as the driving force behind the enormously successful series of blockbusters the studio has released \u2013 is to develop a new Star Wars film, it has been announced. According to the Hollywood Reporter, the Walt Disney Company (which owns both Marvel Studios and Star Wars producers Lucasfilm) has asked Feige to work on Star Wars material with Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy. Disney co-chair Alan Horn said: \u201cWith the close of the Skywalker Saga, [Kennedy] is pursuing a new era in Star Wars storytelling, and knowing what a diehard fan Kevin [Feige] is, it made sense for these two extraordinary producers to work on a Star Wars film together.\u201d No details have been revealed as to the nature of the project, or whether it will operate as part of the \u201cmain\u201d chronological narrative or as a standalone \u201canthology\u201d film. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, due for release in December, is the ninth and final part of the \u201cSkywalker Saga\u201d; Lucasfilm have previously made agreements with Game of Thrones creators David Benioff and DB Weiss and The Last Jedi director Rian Johnson to make separate trilogies. However, Lucasfilm have experienced considerable hiccups in maintaining the Star Wars franchise since the triumphant release of Star Wars: The Force Awakens in 2015. A series of directors have been replaced or sidelined: Tony Gilroy took over from Gareth Edwards on Rogue One, while Colin Trevorrow and director team Phil Lord and Chris Miller were replaced on The Rise of Skywalker and Solo: A Star Wars Story respectively. Disney CEO Bob Iger also admitted that Solo\u2019s disappointing box office results were partly due to \u201cfranchise fatigue\u201d, when the film was released only six months after The Last Jedi. Since 2008, the 23 films that Feige has produced as part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe have grossed over $22.5bn (\u00a318.2bn) worldwide.",

Without a rapid coal phase-out, the climate fight will be futile.\u201d The Be\u0142chat\u00f3w plant burns approximately 45m tonnes of coal each year, and has emitted approximately 1bn tonnes of CO2 over the course of its lifetime. ClientEarth is also challenging the operation of two neighbouring opencast mines, arguing that lignite mining causes significant disturbance to groundwater levels and releases toxic heavy metals into surrounding water and soil. The charity, which was the beneficiary this year of a $21m (\u00a317m) donation from the Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour, has taken successful legal action in Poland before, after the country\u2019s supreme administrative court blocked the construction of a new coal plant in the northern region of Pomerania in June. The victory was emblematic of how climate activism in Poland is growing and changing, with grassroots local activists teaming up with larger NGOs including ClientEarth to exert pressure on the government and private and state-owned energy companies. In August, a ruling by the district court in the north-western city of Pozna\u0144 raised questions about the future of another coal plant, at Ostro\u0142\u0119ka in the north-east. Poland has the highest domestic coal production in Europe, with approximately 80% of its energy derived from the burning of coal. While an increasing proportion of the coal burned in Poland is imported from elsewhere, such as Russia, its rightwing leadership portrays the fossil fuel as a guarantor of the country\u2019s energy security and future economic growth. \u201cThere is no plan today to fully give up on coal,\u201d Poland\u2019s president, Andrzej Duda, said in the run-up to the UN climate talks in December. The event was held in Katowice, in the south-western region of Silesia, the centre of the Polish coal industry. \u201cExperts point out that our supplies run for another 200 years, and it would be hard not to use them,\u201d he added. On Wednesday, another state-owned company opened a new coking coalmine in Jastrz\u0119bie-Zdr\u00f3j, near Poland\u2019s border with the Czech Republic, in a ceremony attended by the Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki. It was the first coalmine to be opened in Poland since 1994. On the same day, Poland\u2019s ruling rightwing Law and Justice party announced plans to pass legislation allowing the government to build coalmines without the need to secure the approval of local authorities. The energy minister, Krzysztof Tch\u00f3rzewski, told reporters at the opening of the mine at Jastrz\u0119bie-Zdr\u00f3j: \u201cThis special legislation being prepared by lawmakers is related to the fact that local authorities are not interested in new mines being built in their areas, while we will need new coal deposits to secure supplies for the energy industry.\u201d Tchorzewski said the legislation would facilitate the development by Polska Grupa Energetyczna of a new lignite open-pit mine at Z\u0142oczew, not far from Be\u0142chat\u00f3w. The Polish government\u2019s continuing enthusiasm for coal is widely seen as obstacle to EU-wide efforts drastically to drastically reduce the bloc\u2019s carbon emissions. Duda was embroiled in a diplomatic spat with Emanuel Macron this week, after the French president singled out the Polish government for blocking his attempts to make the EU commit to carbon neutrality by 2050. \u201cMarching every Friday to say that the planet is burning, that\u2019s nice, but that is not the problem,\u201d Macron said before the recent UN climate talks in New York. \u201cGo protest in Poland! Help me move those I cannot push forward.\u201d Macron\u2019s remarks prompted Duda to describe his French counterpart as \u201cdishonest and impudent\u201d.",

He also took the Group Three Autumn Stakes at Newmarket on Best Solution in October 2016.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/25/talking-horses-enable-continues-smooth-buildup-prix-arc-de-triomphe-racing-tips\">Talking Horses: Enable tunes up for Arc hat-trick bid at Newmarket</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>However, he has not ridden in public since 1 April, five days after he provided a sample during racing at Lingfield Park that later tested positive for benzoylecgonine, a metabolite of cocaine. His most recent ride in 2019 was only his 18th mount of the year, none of which were successful.</p> \n<p>The reason behind his extended absence is now apparent, as the British Horseracing Authority moves to suspend a rider\u2019s licence following a positive test until the case can be heard by its disciplinary panel. If there are no aggravating or mitigating factors, a six-month \u201centry point\u201d ban will be backdated to the start of Carson\u2019s interim suspension. That means he could return to the saddle within the next few weeks.</p> \n<p>Two of the three jockeys to test positive for cocaine earlier in 2019 have already returned to action. Callum Rodriguez and Kevin Lundie, who both provided positive samples during racing at Southwell on 27 February, returned on 7 September and 24 September respectively, while the amateur rider Peter Bryan, who was tested after riding in a hunter chase at Perth on 25 April, is still serving his suspension.</p> \n<p>The news of Carson\u2019s failed test means 2019 is now a record year for cocaine positives in Britain, overtaking 2015, when three riders were caught using the drug.

      "bodyText": "William Carson, the grandson of the Derby-winning jockey Willie, faces a six-month ban from the saddle after becoming the fourth jockey this year to return a positive test for a metabolite of cocaine. Carson, 29, has ridden nearly 500 winners in a 14-year racing career, with his most valuable success coming in the Ayr Gold Cup Handicap in 2008 on Regal Parade. He also took the Group Three Autumn Stakes at Newmarket on Best Solution in October 2016. However, he has not ridden in public since 1 April, five days after he provided a sample during racing at Lingfield Park that later tested positive for benzoylecgonine, a metabolite of cocaine. His most recent ride in 2019 was only his 18th mount of the year, none of which were successful. The reason behind his extended absence is now apparent, as the British Horseracing Authority moves to suspend a rider\u2019s licence following a positive test until the case can be heard by its disciplinary panel. If there are no aggravating or mitigating factors, a six-month \u201centry point\u201d ban will be backdated to the start of Carson\u2019s interim suspension. That means he could return to the saddle within the next few weeks. Two of the three jockeys to test positive for cocaine earlier in 2019 have already returned to action. Callum Rodriguez and Kevin Lundie, who both provided positive samples during racing at Southwell on 27 February, returned on 7 September and 24 September respectively, while the amateur rider Peter Bryan, who was tested after riding in a hunter chase at Perth on 25 April, is still serving his suspension. The news of Carson\u2019s failed test means 2019 is now a record year for cocaine positives in Britain, overtaking 2015, when three riders were caught using the drug. There were two positives in 2016 and 2017, one in 2018 and only one between 2009 and 2014. A rash of cocaine positives in Ireland in recent years prompted the Irish Horseracing Board to increase its standard penalty for the offence to a five-year ban from early 2019. The BHA said at the time that Dr Jerry Hill, its chief medical adviser, would conduct an \u201coverall review of the anti-doping education programme\u201d in 2019, but added the regulator had \u201cno immediate plans\u201d to change its penalty structure \u201coff the back of the Irish announcement\u201d. Thursday\u2019s best bets A full programme of five meetings has survived the heavy rain that swept across much of Britain overnight, but it sounds as if it was very much touch-and-go in the case of the final meeting of the year at Perth. In all, the track took 14mm of rain overnight on ground which was officially good-to-soft, soft in places on Wednesday evening and the going is now, unsurprisingly, heavy. Harriet Graham, Perth\u2019s clerk of the course, tweeted an hour ago that \u201cgroundstaff are moving bends and hurdles on to as much fresh ground as we can find\u201d, and also suggested to the Racing Post that it \u201cwill be pretty attritional stuff\u201d. It remains to be seen how that affects the fields for the seven races, including the most valuable event on the card, a \u00a317,000 novice chase, which was already a match at the overnight stage. The presence of Grade Two-winning hurdler Wholestone among what was initially a nine-strong entry has seen off all but one opponent, and he will be a very short price to make a successful debut over the bigger obstacles. Newmarket\u2019s Cambridgeshire meeting also gets under way when Top Rank (5.20) is worth backing to maintain his unbeaten record in the Molson Coors Handicap.

      "bodyText": "Speaking in the US, Scott Morrison said he would drastically reduce plastic pollution and strongly defended Australia\u2019s position on climate change. Does what he said stack up? CLAIM: Australia will ban exports of plastic, paper and glass waste starting in 2020 and is leading on practical research and development into recycling. REALITY: Morrison has made dealing with plastic waste the defining environmental issue of his prime ministership, having flagged the export ban in August. Jeff Angel, the director of the Total Environment Centre, says the PM\u2019s interest and apparent commitment to the issue is unprecedented for an Australian leader. But experts say Australia is not yet a leader in recycling research and development (for evidence of leadership, try Finland). Most of Morrison\u2019s commitments are aspirational ahead of a meeting of environment ministers in November. He has promised $167m in recycling investment, but at last count just 12% of Australian plastic waste is recycled, according to government analysis. CLAIM: Australia is taking real action on climate change. One piece of evidence: in 2012, it was estimated Australia would release 693m tonnes of emissions in 2020. As of 2018, this estimate had fallen to 540m tonnes. REALITY: Projections of what Australia will emit have fallen, not actual emissions. Projections are estimates by government officials of how much carbon dioxide will be emitted at a certain date. Their estimate for 2020 has changed. That reduction has nothing to do with national policy. Actual emissions have gone up in almost every sector of Australia\u2019s economy, with the exception of electricity generation (down 15.7% over a decade in the national grid covering the eastern states, as Morrison pointed out). Total national emissions have been rising since 2015, shortly after the Coalition repealed the carbon price scheme. CLAIM: Australia is responsible for just 1.3% of global emissions. REALITY: Australia does emit about 1.3% of global emissions if you don\u2019t include fossil fuel exports. However, Australia has only 0.3% of the global population. Australia is one of the world\u2019s top 20 polluting countries, emitting more than at least 170 others. It is the third-largest exporter of fossil fuels. CLAIM: Australia will exceed its targets under the Kyoto Protocol and meet the commitment it made in Paris. It is making a \u201ccredible, fair, responsible and achievable contribution to global climate change action\u201d. REALITY: Australia is on track to meet its Kyoto targets, but this is more about setting unchallenging goals and using tricks of accounting than genuine emissions reduction. Its first Kyoto target was an 8% increase in emissions between 1990 and 2010. Its second target is a 5% cut below 2000 levels by 2020. Neither target was consistent with what scientists said Australia should be doing to play its part in addressing the problem. The same is true of the 2030 target, a 26-28% cut below 2005 levels. The government\u2019s Climate Change Authority recommended a minimum 45% cut over that timeframe if Australia was to play its part in a deal to limit global warming to less than 2C. Several analyses, including one from the government, have found Australia is not on track to meet even its existing Paris target. CLAIM: Australia has reduced emissions by 367m tonnes of carbon dioxide more than required to meet our 2020 target under the Kyoto deal. REALITY: This is true thanks to the government\u2019s use of carryover credits from Australia beating its first Kyoto target (the 8% increase). Simply put, Australia set itself a target that allowed it to increase emissions and accepted a credit towards the next period of the Kyoto Protocol for staying below that increase. It now plans to use credits from the second Kyoto period towards meeting its Paris target. This is not allowed for in the Paris agreement and opposed by a number of countries, including New Zealand and European Union members. CLAIM: Australia has the highest per capita investment in clean energy technologies of anywhere in the world. One in five Australian households has rooftop solar systems. FACT: True on both counts, but there are signs Australia\u2019s surging clean energy investment is falling off. Researchers from the Australian National University recently reported the per capita growth in clean energy in recent times has been nearly three times faster than the next fastest country, Germany. But recent data from industry group the Clean Energy Council and consultants at Bloomberg New Energy Finance show a drop in spending commitments this year. Dylan McConnell, from the University of Melbourne, says the boom in clean energy spending over the past two years has been largely driven by the 2020 renewable energy target. Most of the investment came in a rush at the end because the Coalition under Tony Abbott considered abolishing and ultimately reduced the target. Uncertainty over its future stalled investment for the better part of two years. Now the target has been met and the government does not plan to extend or replace it. Tristan Edis, a clean energy consultant and analyst, says the government has spent much of its time in power working against clean energy, having tried to abolish support for it under Abbott and deposing Malcolm Turnbull as leader when he tried to introduce a modest policy, the national energy guarantee, to extend support beyond 2020. CLAIM: Australia is \u201cdoing the right thing by our neighbours\u201d on the climate crisis, having committed to investing a further $500m over five years from 2020 for \u201crenewable energy, climate change and resilience in the Pacific\u201d. FACT: Australia did commit $500m to climate projects in the region at the recent Pacific Islands Forum, though whether it qualifies as \u201cfurther\u201d is contestable: the money was drawn from the existing aid budget. Morrison\u2019s claim that Australia is doing the right thing by the Pacific is not shared by several leaders at the forum in Tuvalu. Australia was repeatedly publicly rebuked over its stance on climate change during and after the talks, which almost collapsed due to Australia\u2019s strong resistance to the final communique including references to phasing out coal, limiting global heating to 1.5C and announcing a strategy for zero emissions by 2050 from the final communique. CLAIM: The Great Barrier Reef \u201cremains one of the world\u2019s most pristine areas of natural beauty\u201d and Australia\u2019s $2bn 2050 reef plan is based on the best available science. REALITY: A recent five-year reef report by government scientists at the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority found the outlook for the natural wonder had deteriorated from poor to very poor due to a range of threats, particularly record-breaking sea surface temperatures. Mass bleaching events in 2016 and 2017 led to widespread and unprecedented coral loss in the north and central sections of the reef. Habitat loss and degradation is affecting fish, turtles and seabirds. The authority has warned that without urgent global and national action on the climate crisis \u2013 the single greatest threat facing the natural wonder \u2013 the reef\u2019s plight will not improve. But it is true that the parts of the 2300km reef ecosystem that have escaped coral bleaching, cyclones and outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish are in good condition. The 2050 plan is based on thorough, decades-old science and sets out the challenges: the reefs face a \u201cworrying outlook\u201d if countries fail to limit global warming to 1.5-2C. It names climate change as the biggest threat to the reef\u2019s future, but includes no additional plans to address what causes it, or to lift Australia\u2019s climate target to what scientists say is necessary.

Tokyo is one of the most densely populated cities in the world, a 24/7 whirl of bodies and traffic, but when you walk the streets there is barely a dog-end on the pavements. There are very few bins, but there is no litter, until you reach a stadium on match day, and then it is swiftly picked up by locals. Rubbish is carried home if necessary, signalling not just a respect of authority but a collective will.</p> <p>Listening to the Georgia coach, Milton Haig, answer a question on Monday about when his side could expect a pathway to the Six Nations, what struck quickly was the irony that a country with little knowledge of rugby union should so completely wrap itself up in the sport while major unions do not look beyond themselves. This World Cup is less than a week old, but it has already set a record for merchandise sales.</p> <p>Haig faced the question in the 2015 World Cup and his answer was the same: who knows? The prospect of the door being opened to Georgia and the other tier-two European nations was never great but following the decision of the Six Nations to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/17/world-rugby-cvc-six-nations-premiership-deal\" title=\"\">accept investment from a private equity company</a>, the championship will be ring-fenced indefinitely.</p> <p>The likes of Georgia may get slightly more access to tier-one nations between World Cups than they have been used to, but it will not prepare them for matches against the likes of Wales. \u201cYou can\u2019t play a team like Wales in the World Cup and expect to produce miracles,\u201d Haig said. \u201cWe need more games against the top nations, but until that happens, unfortunately for us, these type of results will recur. Maybe something will change.\u201d</p> <p>It won\u2019t, at least not in the way Haig would prefer. There was a time when Wales were vulnerable to teams such as Georgia: between 1989 and 2007, they lost to Romania, Canada, Samoa, three times, and failed to make the quarter-finals in three World Cups out of five from 1991. Like Ireland, who were also unremarkable in the early years of the open era, they are not the richest union but have invested heavily in the national team. It has paid off this decade. They have moved away from the countries below and closed the gap with those at the top, both topping the rankings in the last month.</p> <p>Neither has the playing resources of England and France, a disadvantage offset by the control they exercise over their leading players.

      "bodyText": "The way Japan has embraced the World Cup and a sport that otherwise attracts little attention is visible wherever a match is staged. The manager at a hotel in Toyota on Monday, bedecked in the kit of the host nation, admitted he knew nothing about the oval code but felt he had a duty to support the event. And so that night the streets of downtown Toyota were crowded with locals wearing Wales jerseys and supporting them against Georgia with the same fervour of those who have travelled nearly 6,000 miles to follow the team. \u201cIt is a matter of national pride,\u201d said the manager, who admitted he would be following next year\u2019s Olympics in Tokyo far more closely than the rugby. \u201cWe want people to think well of Japan.\u201d They do not do things half-heartedly here. Tokyo is one of the most densely populated cities in the world, a 24/7 whirl of bodies and traffic, but when you walk the streets there is barely a dog-end on the pavements. There are very few bins, but there is no litter, until you reach a stadium on match day, and then it is swiftly picked up by locals. Rubbish is carried home if necessary, signalling not just a respect of authority but a collective will. Listening to the Georgia coach, Milton Haig, answer a question on Monday about when his side could expect a pathway to the Six Nations, what struck quickly was the irony that a country with little knowledge of rugby union should so completely wrap itself up in the sport while major unions do not look beyond themselves. This World Cup is less than a week old, but it has already set a record for merchandise sales. Haig faced the question in the 2015 World Cup and his answer was the same: who knows? The prospect of the door being opened to Georgia and the other tier-two European nations was never great but following the decision of the Six Nations to accept investment from a private equity company, the championship will be ring-fenced indefinitely. The likes of Georgia may get slightly more access to tier-one nations between World Cups than they have been used to, but it will not prepare them for matches against the likes of Wales. \u201cYou can\u2019t play a team like Wales in the World Cup and expect to produce miracles,\u201d Haig said. \u201cWe need more games against the top nations, but until that happens, unfortunately for us, these type of results will recur. Maybe something will change.\u201d It won\u2019t, at least not in the way Haig would prefer. There was a time when Wales were vulnerable to teams such as Georgia: between 1989 and 2007, they lost to Romania, Canada, Samoa, three times, and failed to make the quarter-finals in three World Cups out of five from 1991. Like Ireland, who were also unremarkable in the early years of the open era, they are not the richest union but have invested heavily in the national team. It has paid off this decade. They have moved away from the countries below and closed the gap with those at the top, both topping the rankings in the last month. Neither has the playing resources of England and France, a disadvantage offset by the control they exercise over their leading players. One reason the English union is having to save money is the tens of millions of pounds it funnels into Premiership clubs who spend much of it by attracting players from other countries: one union\u2019s money spent on destabilising another. Meanwhile, the Wales full-back Liam Williams always seems to have full release for his country despite his union paying nothing for the privilege. The rise of Wales and Ireland, who were both among the more impressive performers in the opening round, have left Italy and Scotland on the back foot. Is it any surprise then that Scotland were the ones who among the Six Nations most strongly resisted World Rugby\u2019s Nations League plan? After Scotland\u2019s no-show against Ireland in Yokohama, when it was as if they had stepped on to the field for a light training session after a long flight rather than a match that would go a long way to deciding who topped the group, the Scottish union should explain why it should have the right to deny, without a time limit, countries such as Georgia and Romania the right to dine at international rugby\u2019s top table. At least Georgia showed spirit against Wales after falling 29-0 behind in a masterly tactical display by the Six Nations champions, and no little skill, and how Russia kept going on the opening night against Japan. Fiji may have shocked Australia had the television match official adhered to the terms of his contract, Namibia got stuck into Italy and Fiji lacked the edge they had shown against the Wallabies against a spirited Uruguay who had last been heard of losing 60-3 to England in Manchester four years ago. \u201cSmall boys like us scramble around for the tier one\u2019s scraps,\u201d Haig said, an indictment of a sport that is in thrall to the acquisitiveness of a few; greed rather than globalisation. There is talk about the legacy the World Cup will leave on Japan and Asia but what about the legacy Japan can leave on the game itself, to treat it in the round and throw everything into its entirety? \u2022 This is an extract from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

And I did \u2013 all kinds of cheeses: a beautiful hard cheese called Napier, a racy little blue called London Blue, a soft cheese in the spirit of the subtle, creamy cheeses of Grenoble, called Londonshire. It was one of the most fascinating days I have spent all year, partly due to the mix of the student body. There was a Polish hotelier, hoping to set up his own cheese courses after his early career as a bakery tutor led to epic weight gain. A Danish driving instructor, who had lived in the UK for 45 years, was the most pro-cheese and anti-Brexit person I have ever met, which led me to suspect some connection between those two things. A guy from Kansas was tacking the course on to the end of a trip to London for the DSEI arms fair; we passed an agreeable (to me) five minutes arguing about the protests outside it. (\u201cDo these guys even know what they\u2019re protesting against,\u201d he mused. \u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201cit\u2019s different every year, as you would know if you knew who the arms were killing.\u201d)</p> <p>But apart from all the humans, the revelation was whey: I had filed this away in my mind as a tasteless substance favoured by health freaks whose protein needs were so high that there weren\u2019t enough hours in the day to service them with real food. The very existence of a thing called \u201cvegan whey\u201d made me suspect it was more of a wellness thing than a real, food-related thing (in fact, vegan whey is just a name for plant-based protein \u2013 it has nothing to do with whey).</p> <p>Over the course of the day, we produced more whey than I have ever seen in the rest of my life put together, and it was clearly not a waste product, but carefully collected. I came to realise that maybe I had been missing something.</p> <p>The obvious use for it is to make ricotta, which is usually just boiled whey. Indeed, if you have industrial quantities of whey, it would be perverse not to make ricotta. With the three litres of whey that I took home after my cheese day, though, there would be no point; you would just be making washing up. Instead, use it as a kind of enriched or, if you prefer, \u201cmagic\u201d water.</p> <p>I started off with perfectly plain fresh pasta, cooked for four minutes in whey cut 50: 50 with water. The result was unspeakably good: it had a bizarre depth and richness and felt utterly complete. I had fried some sage leaves for flavour, but ended up eating them separately as pudding. You can use the same technique to boil vegetables, although the less sweet your veg, the more you can taste the difference. Cooking in this fashion has quite a subtle effect on carrots and sweetcorn, but on green beans, the impact is nuclear. Even the colour seems more intense.</p> <p>You can also use whey in preserving, for sauerkrauts and whatnot, which puts you in the incredibly nutritious and also very fashionable territory of fermentation (see Tim Spector\u2019s book <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/diet-myth-422262.html\" title=\"\">The Diet Myth</a> for the fullest account). This is incredibly good for your gut microbiome, which in turn is good for your entire health, including mental wellbeing (the vagus nerve, which transmits messages from the brain to the gut, goes both ways). So you can mess up your digestion with a low mood, but also lift your mood with excellent digestion. Fermentation was a part of most cuisines centuries before its benefits were discovered, except in places such as Britain, where we preserve with vinegar, which kills everything. It will be another eight weeks before I can tell you what the sauerkraut tastes like, and that assumes that it doesn\u2019t rot like the last time I tried it and end up smelling like a dead body.

And bafflingly, says Keith Sides, one half of Wildes Cheese, it has the same restorative affect on concrete as it does on muscles.</p> <p>Really, the only thing whey doesn\u2019t do is get distributed in supermarkets; you could cut a deal with a local cheesemaker, but if you really wanted a year-round supply of whey, it would be simpler to make your own cheese.

Part instruction manual, part howl of rage, <em>Equal</em> tells a personal story that changed the public debate.</p> <p>Nearly 50 years after equal pay was first enshrined in UK law, there are still too many instances where women are paid less, not just when they work flexibly or in lower paid jobs but when they do the same job. The fact that this illegal behaviour takes place at the BBC, where Gracie had worked successfully for 30 years, fuels a sense of fury.</p> <p>Having made equal pay a requirement of her posting as China editor to Beijing, she finds out just how much more the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jan/12/john-humphrys-jokes-about-bbc-gender-pay-gap-in-leaked-off-air-recording\" title=\"\">BBC pays Jon Sopel</a>, the North American editor in July 2017, when the corporation is forced to reveal by the Royal Charter the employees paid more than \u00a3150,000. Sopel is paid between \u00a3230,000 and \u00a3239,000; Gracie isn\u2019t even on the list.</p> <p>Her shock at the behaviour of the BBC, an organisation she obviously cherishes, gives her story the feel of a personal betrayal but, as she points out, if a great organisation can do this to her \u2013 an award-winning, Oxbridge-educated, well-paid white woman \u2013 what about everybody else?</p> <p>Pay is complex, but the BBC does not cover itself in glory in this saga. Gracie\u2019s \u201clong and careful emails\u201d go unheeded, her hours and profile are questioned and she says the experience was worse than her treatment for cancer.</p> <p>At times the situation becomes Kafkaesque. Gracie is told she cannot record a grievance hearing and is then locked in a series of frustrating, debilitating battles over what was actually said. \u201cHow can I trust you?\u201d she says of an organisation which needs more than ever to be trusted. At one point, the BBC HR department blames the fact Gracie was in \u201cgrowth and development\u201d for the pay discrepancy. \u201cLike Ginger Rogers, I did everything the North America editor did except backwards and in high heels \u2013 in this case not literally but in Mandarin and with a police state at my back.\u201d</p> <p>I played a small and unwitting role in this battle on the day Gracie went public, when members of the supportive network of BBC Women such as Jane Garvey were not allowed to interview her and so I was called to do so instead.</p> <p>There are typically more men called John in senior positions at the BBC than women and two in particular \u2013 John Humphrys and Jon Sopel \u2013 are criticised in this book. But there are moments of warmth and humour as well as rage. When a senior executive asks to come to her house, Gracie flies into a panic, rushing to hide the washing-up \u2013 and her son. \u201cImagine the home of a single parent locked in a long battle with her employer and suffering depression as a result. That\u2019s what my house looked like,\u201d she writes.</p> <p>The BBC finally agree to pay Gracie \u00a3361,000 in back pay, a sum she donates to the Fawcett Society to set up an equal pay advice service. The fact that she wrote this book in six months of unpaid leave confirms that this is not about her getting more money, but about making the entire system fair and transparent.</p> <p>The book is full of advice for others \u2013 there is a separate section at the end for employers, men and women. And there are signs of change. On the day Gracie goes public with her fight, she is presenting the <em>Today</em> programme, which discusses the #MeToo movement in Hollywood and gender balance in parliament. \u201cAlmost every story resonated with mine,\u201d she realises. Now back in her old job presenting on BBC News, her decision to use her personal story for the public good has put the issue of equal pay firmly on the agenda. Her final piece of advice? \u201cLike talking about other delicate subjects, like sex or death, it gets easier the more you try.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022<em> Equal is published by Virago (\u00a318.99).

Having made equal pay a requirement of her posting as China editor to Beijing, she finds out just how much more the BBC pays Jon Sopel, the North American editor in July 2017, when the corporation is forced to reveal by the Royal Charter the employees paid more than \u00a3150,000. Sopel is paid between \u00a3230,000 and \u00a3239,000; Gracie isn\u2019t even on the list. Her shock at the behaviour of the BBC, an organisation she obviously cherishes, gives her story the feel of a personal betrayal but, as she points out, if a great organisation can do this to her \u2013 an award-winning, Oxbridge-educated, well-paid white woman \u2013 what about everybody else? Pay is complex, but the BBC does not cover itself in glory in this saga. Gracie\u2019s \u201clong and careful emails\u201d go unheeded, her hours and profile are questioned and she says the experience was worse than her treatment for cancer. At times the situation becomes Kafkaesque. Gracie is told she cannot record a grievance hearing and is then locked in a series of frustrating, debilitating battles over what was actually said. \u201cHow can I trust you?\u201d she says of an organisation which needs more than ever to be trusted. At one point, the BBC HR department blames the fact Gracie was in \u201cgrowth and development\u201d for the pay discrepancy. \u201cLike Ginger Rogers, I did everything the North America editor did except backwards and in high heels \u2013 in this case not literally but in Mandarin and with a police state at my back.\u201d I played a small and unwitting role in this battle on the day Gracie went public, when members of the supportive network of BBC Women such as Jane Garvey were not allowed to interview her and so I was called to do so instead. There are typically more men called John in senior positions at the BBC than women and two in particular \u2013 John Humphrys and Jon Sopel \u2013 are criticised in this book. But there are moments of warmth and humour as well as rage. When a senior executive asks to come to her house, Gracie flies into a panic, rushing to hide the washing-up \u2013 and her son. \u201cImagine the home of a single parent locked in a long battle with her employer and suffering depression as a result. That\u2019s what my house looked like,\u201d she writes. The BBC finally agree to pay Gracie \u00a3361,000 in back pay, a sum she donates to the Fawcett Society to set up an equal pay advice service. The fact that she wrote this book in six months of unpaid leave confirms that this is not about her getting more money, but about making the entire system fair and transparent. The book is full of advice for others \u2013 there is a separate section at the end for employers, men and women. And there are signs of change. On the day Gracie goes public with her fight, she is presenting the Today programme, which discusses the #MeToo movement in Hollywood and gender balance in parliament. \u201cAlmost every story resonated with mine,\u201d she realises. Now back in her old job presenting on BBC News, her decision to use her personal story for the public good has put the issue of equal pay firmly on the agenda. Her final piece of advice? \u201cLike talking about other delicate subjects, like sex or death, it gets easier the more you try.\u201d \u2022 Equal is published by Virago (\u00a318.99).

Researchers haven\u2019t yet defined what symptoms constitute CTE, but family members and others report depression, anxiety, as well as memory, mood or personality changes.</p> <p>CTE can only be diagnosed with certainty after death through an examination of the brain.

Meaning that Gronkowski, or others, can\u2019t say with certainty that they have the condition.</p> <p><strong>Misconception 2: The number of concussions is linked to CTE</strong></p> <p>Research suggests that CTE is the result of repetitive subconcussive impacts (ie hits or blows that do not cause a concussion) and is not linked to the number of documented concussions. In fact, CTE has been found in athletes without a history of concussion. \u201cThe reality is a concussion diagnosis is based on many factors and a broad array of symptoms,\u201d said Nowinski. \u201cIn my mind, because a person\u2019s recollection of the number may not be clear, the number is flawed at baseline.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Misconception 3: CTE can\u2019t be treated</strong></p> <p>While CTE is neurodegenerative disease and there isn\u2019t a cure, the symptoms often associated with the condition \u2013 like depression or anxiety\u2013 can be treated.

Also, symptoms such has cognitive problems, depression or headaches, which may lead some to believe they have CTE, can be caused by other conditions that mimic CTE. Nowinski\u2019s foundation urges the consideration of other diagnoses before focusing on CTE.</p> <p><strong>Misconception 4: The governing bodies of sports now recognize the problem</strong></p> <p>According to Nowinski, the NFL has started to address CTE, acknowledging a link between head trauma and the disease. However, the NHL and Fifa are lagging far behind. In fact, after a 2017 study confirmed the presence of CTE on post-mortem exams of former professional soccer players, <a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/news/fifa-says-no-true-evidence-brain-injury-risk-134242564--sow.html\">Fifa doubled down on its denial</a>. \u201cTo our very best knowledge, there is currently no true evidence of the negative effect of heading or other subconcussive blows,\u201d said a Fifa representative, \u201cResults from studies on active and former professional football players in relation to brain function are inconclusive.\u201d</p> <p>Nowinski believes it\u2019s hard to change hearts and minds, but even harder to change the business of sports. \u201cThere\u2019s also the business of sports,\u201d he says. \u201cThe job of the CEOs and directors of youth sports leagues isn\u2019t to manage the future of kids 20 years from now, their job is to keep participation numbers as high as possible. Nobody wants to raise their hand and say we need to change the sport and risk losing participation.\u201d</p> <p>Illustrating Nowinski\u2019s point, Jon Butler, Pop Warner\u2019s executive director, in an <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/college-football-takes-aim-at-its-greatest-issues-as-it-tries-to-reinvent-the-game-for-the-future/\">interview with CBS Sports,</a> expressed his frustration with the media\u2019s focus on safety. \u201cFirst, we have a duty to football.

We\u2019ll figure this out.</p> <p><strong>Misconception 5: There isn\u2019t a link between youth football and CTE</strong></p> <p>Many use the fact that CTE has not been documented in young football players as evidence that youth football is safe. \u201cThat\u2019s like saying there is no link between youth smoking and lung cancer because you\u2019ve never seen a 13-year-old with lung cancer,\u201d says Nowinski. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen CTE in a 13-year-old because they rarely die and rarely have their brain donated if they die. He points out that there may well be a delay between someone\u2019s exposure to football and them developing the disease: \u201cIt\u2019s not because they can\u2019t develop CTE,\u201d he says.</p> <p><strong>Misconception 6: Helmets can prevent concussions and CTE</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/8/eaau3460\">A recent study</a>, performed by researchers from the University of Rochester, found that a single season of college football can cause changes in the brain.

      "body": "<p>Adrian Hayes\u2019 journey to the summit of K2, the 28,251ft beast nestled between Pakistan and China and largely known in mountaineering circles as the most challenging peak in existence, took over two years. Yet when the world renowned British extreme adventurer finally reached the summit, he didn\u2019t spend much time relishing in his accomplishment. Hayes didn\u2019t snap Instagram selfies, chug beer or really even relax. He paused for about five minutes to give his mate a bear hug and call his family. Then he began the perilous descent. Hayes would finally exhale when he reached base camp, a celebration of conquering both the mountain and his demons.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/One-Mans-Climb-Journey-Tragedy/dp/1526745372\">One Man\u2019s Climb: A Journey of Trauma, Tragedy, and Triumph on K2</a>, Hayes details his two attempts at summiting what is known as Savage Mountain because of the brutal rock falls, vertical ice bands and avalanches that have claimed the lives of 85 mountaineers. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/24/sport/everest-k2-adrian-ballinger-emily-harrington-spt-intl/index.html\">Only 379 have ever reached the summit</a>. Meanwhile, Hayes interweaves his narrative with a lens into his calamitous personal life which includes a lengthy divorce battle and the grueling quest to have in-person contact with his daughter.</p> <p>Hayes\u2019s first attempt at K2 in 2013, a climb for which he had considered for 18 months and trained for half a year, ended in despair. Hayes\u2019s team, along other seven others representing countries spanning the globe, were thwarted by extreme weather conditions and made the exasperating decision to return to base camp. But Marty and Denali Schmidt, a beloved team attempting to become the first father-son duo to scale K2, were the sole outliers. They continued. They would never return.</p> <p>Two days later, upon hearing the news of the Schmidts\u2019 death, Hayes sat on a rock as tears formed in his eyes. The Schmidts were gone. He had failed to summit K2. He was returning to a shaky personal life.</p> <p>\u201cAs I sat back on that rock, in a way it gave me purpose, it helped me understand that would have happened to me,\u201d Hayes says. \u201cMountaineers look at death differently. It happens in the sport all the time and you have to learn the lessons on why it happens and decision-making.

      "bodyText": "Adrian Hayes\u2019 journey to the summit of K2, the 28,251ft beast nestled between Pakistan and China and largely known in mountaineering circles as the most challenging peak in existence, took over two years. Yet when the world renowned British extreme adventurer finally reached the summit, he didn\u2019t spend much time relishing in his accomplishment. Hayes didn\u2019t snap Instagram selfies, chug beer or really even relax. He paused for about five minutes to give his mate a bear hug and call his family. Then he began the perilous descent. Hayes would finally exhale when he reached base camp, a celebration of conquering both the mountain and his demons. In One Man\u2019s Climb: A Journey of Trauma, Tragedy, and Triumph on K2, Hayes details his two attempts at summiting what is known as Savage Mountain because of the brutal rock falls, vertical ice bands and avalanches that have claimed the lives of 85 mountaineers. Only 379 have ever reached the summit. Meanwhile, Hayes interweaves his narrative with a lens into his calamitous personal life which includes a lengthy divorce battle and the grueling quest to have in-person contact with his daughter. Hayes\u2019s first attempt at K2 in 2013, a climb for which he had considered for 18 months and trained for half a year, ended in despair. Hayes\u2019s team, along other seven others representing countries spanning the globe, were thwarted by extreme weather conditions and made the exasperating decision to return to base camp. But Marty and Denali Schmidt, a beloved team attempting to become the first father-son duo to scale K2, were the sole outliers. They continued. They would never return. Two days later, upon hearing the news of the Schmidts\u2019 death, Hayes sat on a rock as tears formed in his eyes. The Schmidts were gone. He had failed to summit K2. He was returning to a shaky personal life. \u201cAs I sat back on that rock, in a way it gave me purpose, it helped me understand that would have happened to me,\u201d Hayes says. \u201cMountaineers look at death differently. It happens in the sport all the time and you have to learn the lessons on why it happens and decision-making. I felt more sadness than grief.\u201d Hayes didn\u2019t know it yet but he would return to the same spot a year later a man so driven no barrier would detract him. For Hayes, the quest to be an all-around adventurer started at a young age, largely to escape a struggling childhood. Hayes grew up in a family-run hotel in the New Forest district of Hampshire, England, climbing trees and wading down rivers like other kids.

      "body": "<p>\u201cPrivate schools help hoard wealth, power and opportunity for the few.\u201d This comment by an anonymous Labour party source a few weeks ago states the problem in a nutshell. Private schools are out of reach (average fees nearly \u00a318,000 a year) for the great majority of people; their spend per pupil is at least three times more than that of state schools \u2013 a grotesque resources gap; and they constitute a highly effective service industry, which not only almost guarantees places at top universities but also provides a network of invaluable connections \u2013 together a passport to life\u2019s glittering prizes, with two old Etonian PMs in the last three years the most visible symbol. They are indeed enablers of wealth hoarding, of power hoarding, of opportunity hoarding. They are, in short, an affront to any notion of a just or inclusive society.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"1ec9e624-fb4c-47a5-a6f9-f3f36fb6bf53\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pN36jVSp1x0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Such was the case put forward in our book <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/25/engines-of-privilege-private-school-problem-david-kynaston-francis-green-review\" title=\"\">Engines of Privilege</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/25/engines-of-privilege-private-school-problem-david-kynaston-francis-green-review\" title=\"\">, published in February</a>, a work in many ways born out of long years of frustration at the prevailing political inertness on the issue. We had no expectation that seven months later the Labour party would vote at its conference to integrate the private sector into the state sector. In criticising Labour\u2019s position, the headmaster of Eton, Simon Henderson, this week acknowledged the public mood was shifting on the question, and that a battle lay ahead for the future of private education.</p> \n<p>It is a good moment, with the issue suddenly near the top of the non-Brexit agenda, to ask why over the last three-quarters of a century we have made so little progress in tackling what is, in many ways, a very British problem \u2013 given that in no other western society are private schools so deeply entrenched or so corrosive in their effects. There have been three potential turning points, but all failed to deliver change: the Tory education minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/apr/03/rab-butler-1944-revolutionise-education-act-tim-brighouse\" title=\"\">Rab Butler</a> deftly ensured during the war that the private school issue was excluded from the otherwise historic 1944 Education Act. After the second world war, any reforming zeal on Clement Attlee\u2019s part was emasculated by his umbilical attachment to his old school, Haileybury. And during the 1960s, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/11/jeremy-corbyn-harold-wilson-labour-europe-referendum\" title=\"\">Harold Wilson</a>\u2019s Labour government initiated a royal commission on the public schools (as they were still absurdly called), whose mouse of a report in July 1968 achieved precisely nothing. The report did, however, prompt a flurry of letters to the Guardian. On 25 July, the letters page featured a pocket cartoon by the paper\u2019s brilliant resident cartoonist, Abu. It showed a rather cross-looking man scribbling a letter \u2013 \u201cSir, with reference to your leader on the public school system\u2019s divisive influence on our society \u2026\u201d \u2013 and above him a calendar. The date was 25 July 2068.</p> \n<p>It is now nearer to 2068 than 1968, and nothing of real substance has been achieved. But after four decades of virtual permafrost, things are hotting up again.

Yet whatever happens politically this autumn and beyond, we as a society are unlikely to make any serious progress on the issue unless we understand why we have so comprehensively failed to do so in the past.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/25/engines-of-privilege-private-school-problem-david-kynaston-francis-green-review\">Engines of Privilege review \u2013 a challenge to Britain's private schools?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Some of the reasons are obvious enough. Although the private school issue is ultimately about what kind of society we are, it tends in everyday practice to be treated as a narrowly educational matter. At any one time, from the perspective of, say, the education secretary, or the Department for Education, what is happening to the 93% of children not at private schools understandably takes priority. Historically, the key figure here is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/sep/16/politics.comment\" title=\"\">Anthony Crosland</a>, Labour\u2019s great postwar intellectual. \u201cI have never been able to understand,\u201d he famously asserted in 1956 in his influential work <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/feb/19/tonyslegacytotony\" title=\"\">The Future of Socialism</a></em>, \u201cwhy socialists have been so obsessed with the question of the grammar schools, and so indifferent to the much more glaring injustice of the independent schools.\u201d Yet as education secretary in the 1960s, he pushed the private school issue into the long grass.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7827dd5fff323201ae2f19f7b26a5e3bf5ade811\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7827dd5fff323201ae2f19f7b26a5e3bf5ade811/0_0_5080_3332/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Girls from a private school in Gloucestershire \u2026 \" width=\"1000\" height=\"656\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Girls at a private school in Gloucestershire \u2026 \u2018We don\u2019t hear the state schools complaining about us. What they complain about is the lack of funding from government,\u2019 say private school headteachers.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There is also what we call the \u201cdifferent planet\u201d problem. In London and the south-east, as well as in such affluent cities as Edinburgh, Oxford and York, private schools may be thick on the ground and the subject of endless fraught conversations. Elsewhere, in large parts of Britain, they are rarer and do not impinge on most people\u2019s daily lives or consciousness. Physical location, similarly, matters in the sense that many of the leading private schools, especially boarding schools, are tucked away in the countryside or semi-countryside \u2013 out of sight, out of mind.</p> \n<p>Also unhelpful has been what seems to be an intense reluctance on the part of the vast majority of state school leaders to put their heads above the parapet and speak out on the private school issue. During our public encounters with private school heads after the publication of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jan/13/public-schools-david-kynaston-francis-green-engines-of-privilege\" title=\"\">Engines of Privilege</a></em>, nothing has been more irritating than their line of: \u201cWe don\u2019t hear the state schools complaining about us. What they complain about is the lack of funding from government.\u201d Admittedly, it has been a state school teacher, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/holly-rigby\" title=\"\">Holly Rigby</a>, one of the driving forces behind LAPS, who has pointed out the demotivating effects of private school privilege. But on the whole the private school leaders are correct: their state school counterparts remain the dog that fails to bark. Is this because they don\u2019t want to be seen as overly political? Because to privilege the private school issue might somehow be viewed as denigrating the state school system? Or, perhaps most likely, because they have a large amount on their plate and just want to get on with it, without casting unproductively envious eyes elsewhere? Yet because of the yawning resources gap they are in effect operating with one hand tied behind their backs, not helped by the debilitating flow of state-trained teachers from state schools into private schools. </p> \n<p>This is especially the case given the very effective PR machine that the private sector has at its disposal. The wider economic benefits conferred, all the wonderful partnerships with state schools, the many bursaries open to poor children, the sanctity of parental choice, the irretrievable damage that any reform would do to \u201cthe fabric of education in this country\u201d \u2013 the daily drumbeat continues from the Independent Schools Council and other seldom accountable industry bodies, complete with a sophisticated and shameless line in \u201cthe problem lies elsewhere\u201d, as we have found in our public encounters. And since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/sep/22/labour-delegates-vote-in-favour-of-abolishing-private-schools\" title=\"\">Sunday\u2019s vote at the Labour conference</a>, the drumbeat has turned into a frenzy, accompanied by a palpable closing of the ranks on the part of powerful allies.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>On the moral question of whether it is right for parents to pay for education and thereby buy advantage for their children, we could detect little movement</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Yet in some of our private meetings with private school leaders since our book was published, we have found them surprisingly willing to move away from a stubbornly defensive mode and to discuss constructively how the sector can actually do what it claims it wants to do, namely to transform the composition of their schools away from social exclusivity and towards social diversity. Have the schools got the financial resources to do this, through a vastly expanded bursaries programme, off their own bat? Or would such a scheme have to rely on state-funded places? And would this involve the state determining who gets the places and a lessening of independent governance? On all this they are more open-minded than we had expected \u2013 even if they have not yet fully confronted all the issues that would arise. Though on the essential moral question of whether in a good society it is right for parents to pay vast sums for education and thereby buy positional advantage for their children, we could detect little or no movement.</p> \n<p>The media, mostly, do not help. In researching our book, we were struck by the almost complete absence of detailed investigation of the private school sector\u2019s claims and practices. Tellingly, it was not the press, largely hostile to private school reform, that engaged in such work but the select committee on education, which in November 2017 forced the admission that although private schools subsidise up to a third of places (on a far from transparent basis), a mere 1% of places are fully funded. The suspected gaming of the system \u2013 whether through identifying special needs (to buy more exam time) that for some reason seem to be more prevalent in the private sector than in state schools, or spending liberally on exam challenges, or maximising informal contacts with top universities \u2013 is especially ripe for investigation. The press is lazily culpable of buying into the sector\u2019s propaganda. \u201cPrivate education is no longer the preserve of the privileged,\u201d insisted the Daily Mail earlier this year in a double-page spread about parents \u201cdigging deep\u201d for the sake of giving their children a better education. Yet analysis of government surveys of family resources and spending shows definitively that the few middle-income families with children at private school spend more \u2013 not less \u2013 on their holidays and other recreational activities than similar families with children at state schools. The only realistic conclusion is that for the most part they are able to draw on a significant degree of non-income family wealth.</p> \n<p>What about the politicians? From Margaret Thatcher onwards, the pursuit of greater equality of opportunity (as opposed to equality of outcome) has been proclaimed as lying somewhere near the very heart of the Tory creed. Yet with painfully few exceptions, notably the odd fluttering from Michael Gove, politicians of the right have stubbornly refused to face the stark incompatibility between equality of opportunity and a flourishing fee-paying sector. When this summer we asked a sympathetic Tory backbencher if she could recommend a similarly sympathetic colleague for us to talk to, she could only name one. \u201cThey all educate their children privately\u201d and \u201cthey don\u2019t actually care about equality of opportunity\u201d are the two most commonly wielded explanations whenever we\u2019ve discussed this with others. But perhaps one day those politicians will take the issue seriously, and at last grapple with the competing demands of liberty and equity.</p> \n<p>The greater responsibility, given their larger commitment to the values of fairness and inclusivity, lies with Labour politicians. \u201cThat\u2019s a hard one you\u2019ve taken on there,\u201d Gordon Brown wryly remarked to us in 2014 \u2013 testimony to the fatalism about the private school issue that had gripped his party even before the coming of New Labour. Too complicated, too invidious, too emotive, altogether too hot to handle. Such, despite the simplicity of the fundamental argument about unfairness, were the default assumptions for all those years, and which are only now starting to change. There persists a great vulnerability, namely the exposure to the charge of hypocrisy against any Labour politician who has been privately educated or, still worse, chosen as a parent to go private. In our view, such politicians, whose general dislike of private education is at odds with their own decision as parents, should be exempt from accusations of hypocrisy unless (which is clearly not the case yet) they are actively imposing denial of choice on parents generally.

      "bodyText": "\u201cPrivate schools help hoard wealth, power and opportunity for the few.\u201d This comment by an anonymous Labour party source a few weeks ago states the problem in a nutshell. Private schools are out of reach (average fees nearly \u00a318,000 a year) for the great majority of people; their spend per pupil is at least three times more than that of state schools \u2013 a grotesque resources gap; and they constitute a highly effective service industry, which not only almost guarantees places at top universities but also provides a network of invaluable connections \u2013 together a passport to life\u2019s glittering prizes, with two old Etonian PMs in the last three years the most visible symbol. They are indeed enablers of wealth hoarding, of power hoarding, of opportunity hoarding. They are, in short, an affront to any notion of a just or inclusive society. Such was the case put forward in our book Engines of Privilege, published in February, a work in many ways born out of long years of frustration at the prevailing political inertness on the issue. We had no expectation that seven months later the Labour party would vote at its conference to integrate the private sector into the state sector. In criticising Labour\u2019s position, the headmaster of Eton, Simon Henderson, this week acknowledged the public mood was shifting on the question, and that a battle lay ahead for the future of private education. It is a good moment, with the issue suddenly near the top of the non-Brexit agenda, to ask why over the last three-quarters of a century we have made so little progress in tackling what is, in many ways, a very British problem \u2013 given that in no other western society are private schools so deeply entrenched or so corrosive in their effects. There have been three potential turning points, but all failed to deliver change: the Tory education minister Rab Butler deftly ensured during the war that the private school issue was excluded from the otherwise historic 1944 Education Act. After the second world war, any reforming zeal on Clement Attlee\u2019s part was emasculated by his umbilical attachment to his old school, Haileybury. And during the 1960s, Harold Wilson\u2019s Labour government initiated a royal commission on the public schools (as they were still absurdly called), whose mouse of a report in July 1968 achieved precisely nothing. The report did, however, prompt a flurry of letters to the Guardian. On 25 July, the letters page featured a pocket cartoon by the paper\u2019s brilliant resident cartoonist, Abu. It showed a rather cross-looking man scribbling a letter \u2013 \u201cSir, with reference to your leader on the public school system\u2019s divisive influence on our society \u2026\u201d \u2013 and above him a calendar. The date was 25 July 2068. It is now nearer to 2068 than 1968, and nothing of real substance has been achieved. But after four decades of virtual permafrost, things are hotting up again. Books (including Melissa Benn\u2019s Life Lessons and Robert Verkaik\u2019s Posh Boys, as well as our own) are starting to confront the issue. Private School Policy Reform (PSPR, of which we are among the founders) is a newly established and politically independent website-cum-thinktank. Labour Against Private Schools (LAPS) is a new and energetic pressure group. And, of course, Labour itself has now voted in favour of radical change. Yet whatever happens politically this autumn and beyond, we as a society are unlikely to make any serious progress on the issue unless we understand why we have so comprehensively failed to do so in the past. Some of the reasons are obvious enough. Although the private school issue is ultimately about what kind of society we are, it tends in everyday practice to be treated as a narrowly educational matter. At any one time, from the perspective of, say, the education secretary, or the Department for Education, what is happening to the 93% of children not at private schools understandably takes priority. Historically, the key figure here is Anthony Crosland, Labour\u2019s great postwar intellectual. \u201cI have never been able to understand,\u201d he famously asserted in 1956 in his influential work The Future of Socialism, \u201cwhy socialists have been so obsessed with the question of the grammar schools, and so indifferent to the much more glaring injustice of the independent schools.\u201d Yet as education secretary in the 1960s, he pushed the private school issue into the long grass. There is also what we call the \u201cdifferent planet\u201d problem. In London and the south-east, as well as in such affluent cities as Edinburgh, Oxford and York, private schools may be thick on the ground and the subject of endless fraught conversations. Elsewhere, in large parts of Britain, they are rarer and do not impinge on most people\u2019s daily lives or consciousness. Physical location, similarly, matters in the sense that many of the leading private schools, especially boarding schools, are tucked away in the countryside or semi-countryside \u2013 out of sight, out of mind. Also unhelpful has been what seems to be an intense reluctance on the part of the vast majority of state school leaders to put their heads above the parapet and speak out on the private school issue. During our public encounters with private school heads after the publication of Engines of Privilege, nothing has been more irritating than their line of: \u201cWe don\u2019t hear the state schools complaining about us. What they complain about is the lack of funding from government.\u201d Admittedly, it has been a state school teacher, Holly Rigby, one of the driving forces behind LAPS, who has pointed out the demotivating effects of private school privilege. But on the whole the private school leaders are correct: their state school counterparts remain the dog that fails to bark. Is this because they don\u2019t want to be seen as overly political? Because to privilege the private school issue might somehow be viewed as denigrating the state school system? Or, perhaps most likely, because they have a large amount on their plate and just want to get on with it, without casting unproductively envious eyes elsewhere? Yet because of the yawning resources gap they are in effect operating with one hand tied behind their backs, not helped by the debilitating flow of state-trained teachers from state schools into private schools. This is especially the case given the very effective PR machine that the private sector has at its disposal. The wider economic benefits conferred, all the wonderful partnerships with state schools, the many bursaries open to poor children, the sanctity of parental choice, the irretrievable damage that any reform would do to \u201cthe fabric of education in this country\u201d \u2013 the daily drumbeat continues from the Independent Schools Council and other seldom accountable industry bodies, complete with a sophisticated and shameless line in \u201cthe problem lies elsewhere\u201d, as we have found in our public encounters. And since Sunday\u2019s vote at the Labour conference, the drumbeat has turned into a frenzy, accompanied by a palpable closing of the ranks on the part of powerful allies. Yet in some of our private meetings with private school leaders since our book was published, we have found them surprisingly willing to move away from a stubbornly defensive mode and to discuss constructively how the sector can actually do what it claims it wants to do, namely to transform the composition of their schools away from social exclusivity and towards social diversity. Have the schools got the financial resources to do this, through a vastly expanded bursaries programme, off their own bat? Or would such a scheme have to rely on state-funded places? And would this involve the state determining who gets the places and a lessening of independent governance? On all this they are more open-minded than we had expected \u2013 even if they have not yet fully confronted all the issues that would arise. Though on the essential moral question of whether in a good society it is right for parents to pay vast sums for education and thereby buy positional advantage for their children, we could detect little or no movement. The media, mostly, do not help. In researching our book, we were struck by the almost complete absence of detailed investigation of the private school sector\u2019s claims and practices. Tellingly, it was not the press, largely hostile to private school reform, that engaged in such work but the select committee on education, which in November 2017 forced the admission that although private schools subsidise up to a third of places (on a far from transparent basis), a mere 1% of places are fully funded.

Wolf-Ferrari\u2019s Susanna\u2019s Secret, a witty comedy of manners and misunderstanding, is a work that gets more than an occasional outing; the same cannot be said of Pietro Mascagni\u2019s Zanetto, apparently receiving its Scottish premiere here 120 years after its first performance.</p> <p>Zanetto is a melodrama-tinged piece, not so much a rounded one-act opera as a sketch detailing an encounter between its two characters: Silvia, a worldly-wise courtesan, here played by soprano Sin\u00e9ad Campbell-Wallace, and Zanetto, a carefree travelling minstrel (mezzo Hanna Hipp). In best <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/16/brief-encounter-romance\">Brief Encounter</a> fashion, they meet, connect and ultimately go their separate ways.

      "bodyText": "Following on from last year\u2019s Lammermuir festival to which they brought one of Britten\u2019s stylised, quasi-religious Church Parables, Scottish Opera returned with a pair of contrasting one-act operas. Wolf-Ferrari\u2019s Susanna\u2019s Secret, a witty comedy of manners and misunderstanding, is a work that gets more than an occasional outing; the same cannot be said of Pietro Mascagni\u2019s Zanetto, apparently receiving its Scottish premiere here 120 years after its first performance. Zanetto is a melodrama-tinged piece, not so much a rounded one-act opera as a sketch detailing an encounter between its two characters: Silvia, a worldly-wise courtesan, here played by soprano Sin\u00e9ad Campbell-Wallace, and Zanetto, a carefree travelling minstrel (mezzo Hanna Hipp). In best Brief Encounter fashion, they meet, connect and ultimately go their separate ways. It\u2019s an operatic storm in a teacup; nothing really happens to justify Mascagni\u2019s passionate, overwhelming music, at times reminiscent of his more familiar Cavalleria Rusticana. But it\u2019s easy to sit back and let the swooning melodies overwhelm, especially here given the richly sung performances, Campbell-Wallace\u2019s powerful but burnished soprano sinuously intertwining with Hipp\u2019s seductive darker hues. Susanna\u2019s Secret is a different work altogether, a frothy comedy-farce about a woman so desperate to hide her nicotine habit from her husband that he thinks she\u2019s having an affair. Clare Presland and Richard Burkhard reprised their roles from Opera Holland Park\u2019s summer production with beguiling vivacity and charm, with Piran Legg showing a droll sense of comic timing in the silent role of the family\u2019s factotum. Director Rosie Purdie kept the staging in both minimal \u2013 the hint of an orange grove in Zanetto, a table and chairs and a vase of flowers in Susanna\u2019s Secret \u2013 but it added colour to the performances.

Soane started out as a bricklayer, went on to design Dulwich Picture Gallery and the Bank of England, and bequeathed Britain <a href=\"https://www.soane.org/about/our-history\">his delirious one-man museum on Lincoln\u2019s Inn Fields.</a> He also built the delightfully odd <a href=\"https://www.pitzhanger.org.uk/\">Pitzhanger Manor</a> in west London where Devlin has installed an epic 3D map of world history.</p> <p>Devlin\u2019s Memory Palace is a railway modeller\u2019s paradise. Using cut bamboo, she has created a capacious warped pale-grey landscape that curves all around you, covered in buildings and mountains and even the sacred fig tree under which Siddhartha sat. Her sprawling diorama is ordered chronologically not topographically \u2013 it\u2019s a map of time, not space \u2013 so the Buddha\u2019s tree is located near the Athenian Acropolis where, Devlin points out on a printed key, Socrates taught. Up near the ceiling are the pyramids of Giza, and in front of a skyscraper island stands the Statue of Liberty.</p> <p>But Devlin wants you to look at the smaller buildings, the apparently anonymous rooftops.

      "bodyText": "The Georgian architect John Soane would have found a lot to enjoy in the curious artwork that stage and gig designer Es Devlin has created in his even more curious home. Soane started out as a bricklayer, went on to design Dulwich Picture Gallery and the Bank of England, and bequeathed Britain his delirious one-man museum on Lincoln\u2019s Inn Fields. He also built the delightfully odd Pitzhanger Manor in west London where Devlin has installed an epic 3D map of world history. Devlin\u2019s Memory Palace is a railway modeller\u2019s paradise. Using cut bamboo, she has created a capacious warped pale-grey landscape that curves all around you, covered in buildings and mountains and even the sacred fig tree under which Siddhartha sat. Her sprawling diorama is ordered chronologically not topographically \u2013 it\u2019s a map of time, not space \u2013 so the Buddha\u2019s tree is located near the Athenian Acropolis where, Devlin points out on a printed key, Socrates taught. Up near the ceiling are the pyramids of Giza, and in front of a skyscraper island stands the Statue of Liberty. But Devlin wants you to look at the smaller buildings, the apparently anonymous rooftops. Her written key directs you to such otherwise indistinguishable landmarks as the house in Kirkcaldy where Adam Smith wrote The Wealth of Nations, or the bus in Montgomery, Alabama, where Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat. Even in the pyramids, she urges us to remember the workers who built them. So this is a memory palace that asks you to look beyond the monuments of kings to see the ideas and acts of courage that change the world. As you stand on a narrow walkway surrounded by this perspective-shifting panorama of historical geography, the entire curvy relief tableau is reflected by a mirrored wall and ceiling that multiply its details.

      "body": "<p>They say you shouldn\u2019t meet your heroes \u2013 but my inner 13-year-old would never forgive me if I spurned a chat with Ben Elton. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2007/oct/20/comedy.television\">The Young Ones</a>, Blackadder and Saturday Live weren\u2019t just a laugh for me; I constructed friendships, my sense of humour, and \u2013 let\u2019s face it \u2013 my identity around them. Elton was the figurehead of the most exciting moment (give or take a 60s satire boom) in British comedy history, a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMkHmaP-BLQ\">sparkly-suited, mullet</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMkHmaP-BLQ\">ed firebrand</a> blazing a trail for comedy\u2019s punk generation \u2013 the so-called \u201calternative comedians\u201d \u2013 to follow.</p> <p>And then he wasn\u2019t. Nowadays you can\u2019t talk about Elton without references to selling out, and to Stewart Lee\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58ZIdyd3rjg\">notorious routine</a> comparing him with Osama bin Laden, who \u201cat least lived his life according to a consistent set of ethical principles\u201d. More on that later: Elton has plenty to say on the subject. But then, he\u2019s got plenty to say on every subject. At 60 and a self-described \u201cdad man\u201d, the artist formerly known as Motormouth (the title of his 1987 album) is as voluble as ever in the run-up to his first standup tour in 15 years.</p> <p>He never meant to stay away so long. But his three kids were growing up, he was living mainly in Fremantle, Australia, his wife Sophie\u2019s home town. He had his writing to occupy him: 16 novels now, not to mention three series of Shakespeare sitcom <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/10/upstart-crow-review-ben-elton-comedy-shakespeare\">Upstart Crow</a> (plus a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/sep/25/david-mitchell-ben-elton-upstart-crow-shakespeare-sitcom-stage-show\">stage version</a>, opening in the West End early next year). Which partly explains why he is \u201cas scared as I get\u201d to return to standup. \u201cWhich is not proper scared,\u201d he clarifies. \u201cWhen I started as a comedian, 38 years ago, standup was very, very rough. That was proper scary. If I hadn\u2019t had my cornflakes by 8am on the day I was compering at the Comedy Store, there was no way I was going to eat.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f3b85aa3b2a40937cd962985028a4054131971f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f3b85aa3b2a40937cd962985028a4054131971f/0_0_2992_1981/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Elton on ITV in 1987.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tirades about \u2018Thatch\u2019 \u2026 Elton on ITV in 1987.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The fear now doesn\u2019t come from any self-doubt about his comedy abilities \u2013 or at least, not officially. Elton in conversation is a fascinating mix of self-regard and thin skin. First he tells me he\u2019s \u201calways a bit down\u201d on his standup achievements, and that Sophie had to coax him to return to the stage. Then he\u2019s bullish, claiming that \u201cwhat I do as a standup is completely unique. You may not like it, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anybody like me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat I do is I talk about ideas,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t do gags. I don\u2019t do trivial observations any more because I\u2019ve run out of them. And I assume everybody\u2019s covered everything by now.\u201d What he does is ruminate on the state of the world. Back in the day, that meant tirades about \u201cThatch\u201d and sexism. Alternative comedy may be thought of as a lefty phenomenon, but \u201cmainly it was a surrealist thing\u201d, he says. \u201cThere were only a few of us who stood up for a political point of view.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t do trivial observations any more.

The outcomes are mixed at best when middle-aged male standups address modern mores (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/apr/03/dave-chappelle-ricky-gervais-standup-comedy-transgender\">Dave Chappelle, Ricky Gervais</a>). \u201cWhen I tell people I\u2019m going on tour,\u201d says Elton, \u201calmost everybody says, \u2018Ooh, you\u2019re brave.\u2019 It\u2019s so weird! We live in a world where people have somehow convinced themselves that, because there\u2019s a few trolls on Twitter, \u2018you can\u2019t say anything, can you?\u2019\u201d He puts on a wheedling voice. \u201c\u2018How am I going to say something when you can\u2019t say anything?\u2019\u201d He\u2019s fascinated by this \u2013 but unlike many of his peers, Elton sees no problem with how language and manners have evolved. \u201cI\u2019ve always been very pro-PC,\u201d he says. \u201cSome people think I invented it. I did it the same day I killed Benny Hill. It was a very busy day for me.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, he\u2019ll be careful what he says on stage. He tells me one joke he\u2019s written concerning trans women \u2013 a clever wordplay, generous in spirit, but open to misinterpretation \u2013 that, after careful consideration, he\u2019s opted not to use in the show. \u201cThese are complicated times. And I do not believe any person of goodwill \u2013 male or female, trans or cis \u2013 would pretend otherwise.\u201d But he\u2019s got no intention of avoiding the subjects. The threat of a backlash is, he thinks, exaggerated. \u201cThere are only a handful of people on any side of a debate who are trolls. Most people, I am certain, wherever they stand, want the best for everyone.\u201d And, in any case, he\u2019s been here before. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s a bit of a risk \u2013 but what are you gonna do?

And isn\u2019t it fascinating that we can invest so much in, and expect so much of, a comedian?</p> <p>But he\u2019s not biting. For Elton, the accusations make no sense because he never identified as anti-establishment in the first place. \u201cHow can you be anti-establishment when you\u2019re on Channel 4? When you\u2019ve written sitcoms for the BBC? This is so silly. Y\u2019know, some people pretend they\u2019re communists. I never suffered from any delusion that that was a good thing to be. I have always been a middle-class, middle-of-the-road farty.\u201d</p> <p>More than that \u2013 and greatly to my surprise \u2013 he denies any iconoclastic dimension to alternative comedy. \u201cThere was no revolutionary intent,\u201d he says, of the movement that radicalised a generation, called out racist and sexist humour, and commissioned a nose-pierced punk (Ade Edmondson\u2019s Vyvyan) to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/mar/03/the-good-life-the-young-ones\">tear the title sequence of twee sitcom The Good Life to shreds</a>. \u201cNo one ever tried to break any boundaries or bust the rules.

      "bodyText": "They say you shouldn\u2019t meet your heroes \u2013 but my inner 13-year-old would never forgive me if I spurned a chat with Ben Elton. The Young Ones, Blackadder and Saturday Live weren\u2019t just a laugh for me; I constructed friendships, my sense of humour, and \u2013 let\u2019s face it \u2013 my identity around them. Elton was the figurehead of the most exciting moment (give or take a 60s satire boom) in British comedy history, a sparkly-suited, mulleted firebrand blazing a trail for comedy\u2019s punk generation \u2013 the so-called \u201calternative comedians\u201d \u2013 to follow. And then he wasn\u2019t. Nowadays you can\u2019t talk about Elton without references to selling out, and to Stewart Lee\u2019s notorious routine comparing him with Osama bin Laden, who \u201cat least lived his life according to a consistent set of ethical principles\u201d. More on that later: Elton has plenty to say on the subject. But then, he\u2019s got plenty to say on every subject. At 60 and a self-described \u201cdad man\u201d, the artist formerly known as Motormouth (the title of his 1987 album) is as voluble as ever in the run-up to his first standup tour in 15 years. He never meant to stay away so long. But his three kids were growing up, he was living mainly in Fremantle, Australia, his wife Sophie\u2019s home town. He had his writing to occupy him: 16 novels now, not to mention three series of Shakespeare sitcom Upstart Crow (plus a stage version, opening in the West End early next year). Which partly explains why he is \u201cas scared as I get\u201d to return to standup. \u201cWhich is not proper scared,\u201d he clarifies. \u201cWhen I started as a comedian, 38 years ago, standup was very, very rough. That was proper scary. If I hadn\u2019t had my cornflakes by 8am on the day I was compering at the Comedy Store, there was no way I was going to eat.\u201d The fear now doesn\u2019t come from any self-doubt about his comedy abilities \u2013 or at least, not officially. Elton in conversation is a fascinating mix of self-regard and thin skin. First he tells me he\u2019s \u201calways a bit down\u201d on his standup achievements, and that Sophie had to coax him to return to the stage. Then he\u2019s bullish, claiming that \u201cwhat I do as a standup is completely unique. You may not like it, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anybody like me.\u201d \u201cWhat I do is I talk about ideas,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t do gags. I don\u2019t do trivial observations any more because I\u2019ve run out of them. And I assume everybody\u2019s covered everything by now.\u201d What he does is ruminate on the state of the world. Back in the day, that meant tirades about \u201cThatch\u201d and sexism. Alternative comedy may be thought of as a lefty phenomenon, but \u201cmainly it was a surrealist thing\u201d, he says. \u201cThere were only a few of us who stood up for a political point of view.\u201d But now, says Elton, he finds himself in a world where he is far less sure of what he thinks. Rightwing demagoguery, post-truth, post-shame: \u201cIn the last third of my life, I am seeing changes that make things that terrified me in the first two-thirds seem like comfortable certainties by comparison.\u201d In such a climate, his 80s bete noire no longer seems so bad \u201cIn light of Trump and Johnson,\u201d he says, \u201cI realise there was at least some political morality to Thatcher, even Reagan.\u201d And as for gender, social media, identity politics \u2013 well, Elton has just written a novel, Identity Crisis, about all that, and will be addressing it on stage, too. Which could go wrong. The outcomes are mixed at best when middle-aged male standups address modern mores (see Dave Chappelle, Ricky Gervais). \u201cWhen I tell people I\u2019m going on tour,\u201d says Elton, \u201calmost everybody says, \u2018Ooh, you\u2019re brave.\u2019 It\u2019s so weird!

Following the success of the Dean series, he began photographing jazz musicians, merging stark, monochrome portraits of the likes of Billie Holiday and Louis Armstrong with often dramatic images of their performances.</p> <p>In a style that was unadorned and intimate, he set about capturing the reality of the nomadic jazz life as well as its drama.

The more free-flowing narrative style of Stock\u2019s Californian pictures was surely informed by his dalliance with the moving image, which began when he left Magnum in 1968 to focus on documentary film-making.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s smearing of a whistleblower at the heart of the impeachment storm is sending a chill through the intelligence services that could discourage the disclosure of serious wrongdoing in future, top Democrats and lawyers warn. As the scandal has deepened over Trump\u2019s efforts to coerce the Ukraine government to dig for dirt on his leading presidential rival Joe Biden, Trump has resorted to one of his favorite tactics \u2013 besmirching the source of the information. The US president has questioned the patriotic loyalty of the \u201cso-called \u2018whistleblower\u2019\u201d as he demeaningly calls the official, asking: \u201cIs he on our country\u2019s side. Where does he come from?\u201d The White House has also planted stories in Fox News and other rightwing media outlets suggesting the whistleblower is motivated by \u201cpolitical bias\u201d. Now top Democrats in Congress and several whistleblower attorneys are pushing back. They warn that a public hounding of the official at the center of the furor could have a demoralizing effect and make it harder to root out corruption and misconduct. A slew of powerful Democratic members of Congress led by Adam Schiff, the chair of the House intelligence committee, have put forward a resolution denouncing Trump\u2019s \u201chighly inappropriate efforts to discredit the whistleblower\u201d. They demand that the US president stop those efforts \u201cimmediately\u201d. Schiff told CNN that the unnamed official was in danger of losing their job, security clearance and even of being prosecuted as a result of having filed a formal whistleblower complaint on 12 August. He added that Trump\u2019s attacks questioning the official\u2019s loyalty to his or her country amounted to a \u201ccomplete breakdown of the whistleblower system and it intimidates other whistleblowers from coming forward\u201d. Little is known about the whistleblower other than that they are a member of the intelligence community that spans 17 government intelligence agencies. They are presumed to be a senior official given that they were party to highly sensitive communications. The whistleblower complaint filed last month is thought to have related in part to the 25 July phone call between Trump and the newly-elected president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. A note of the call released on Wednesday revealed that Trump asked his Ukrainian equivalent for \u201ca favor\u201d. He went on to request that Zelenskiy talk directly to his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and to the US attorney general, William Barr, about investigating the activities of Biden in Ukraine. Biden remains a leading candidate to become the Democratic challenger to Trump in next year\u2019s presidential election. Giuliani has said that any information on Biden that the Ukraine government could provide could be \u201cvery, very helpful to my client\u201d. The whistleblower\u2019s complaint was deemed sufficiently serious by the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general as to be of \u201curgent concern\u201d. Lawyers working with whistleblowers have become increasingly alarmed by the vindictive language used by Trump and senior advisers against the official. \u201cThe clear danger here is that this will set a chill by putting people off coming forward to report fraud, waste or abuse on the part of their government,\u201d said Jesselyn Radack, the director of source protection at ExposeFacts who has represented many of the best known recent whistleblowers including Edward Snowden and Thomas Drake. Radack added that Trump\u2019s \u201cpolitical bias\u201d smear against the intelligence official was an old trick. \u201cPolitical partisanship is often used as a way to deflect from the substance of revelations \u2013 to blame the messenger so that you don\u2019t have to listen to the message. I cannot think of a single case in all my years of doing this work where a whistleblower was motivated by their political party rather than their conscience,\u201d she said. The main law governing whistleblower protections for intelligence officials is the 1998 Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act. Experts say that it fails to ensure against retaliation for those who sound the alarm. Under the terms of the legislation, an intelligence official wanting to expose wrongdoing must go to the inspector general. If that approach fails, they can communicate with the intelligence committees in Congress but only if they have the permission of the director of national intelligence (DNI) who in turn is appointed by the president.

      "bodyText": "A Senate inquiry has called for the reopening of an investigation into the former ministers Julie Bishop and Christopher Pyne taking industry jobs connected with their portfolios, saying the initial probe had failed to ask \u201ccrucial questions\u201d. The Senate inquiry into Bishop and Pyne\u2019s post-political appointments delivered its report on Thursday, urging that the incoming secretary of the department of prime minister and cabinet reopen an investigation into whether ministerial standards were breached. \u201cThe committee recommends, in light of the new information uncovered by the inquiry and media reporting, the prime minister should request the incoming secretary of his department to reopen the investigation of Mr Pyne and Ms Bishop to determine if they have breached the statement of ministerial standards,\u201d the report said. Bishop, foreign affairs minister until August last year, accepted a job with Palladium, one of the biggest foreign aid contractors in Australia. Pyne, the former defence minister, took on a role with consulting giant EY to help it capture a bigger slice of Australia\u2019s growing expenditure on defence. Ministerial standards prevent former ministers from lobbying or holding business meetings with members of the government, parliament, public service or defence force on any matter for which they held ministerial responsibility for 18 months after leaving parliament. They also require ministers not to use information they have obtained in office for private gain. An earlier investigation by then department of prime minister and cabinet secretary, Martin Parkinson, found no breach of the standards. But the Senate inquiry was scathing of the initial investigation, saying it suffered from numerous deficiencies. The committee found the initial investigation by Parkinson was not \u201cparticularly extensive\u201d, relying largely on a single phone call each to Pyne and Bishop, without any contact with Palladium or EY. It was also not treated as a priority, did not ask \u201ccrucial questions\u201d about how conflicts were to be avoided, and failed to reconcile inconsistencies clearly on the public record. The initial investigation also failed to scrutinise whether Pyne and Bishop\u2019s \u201cpersonal conduct is consistent with the dignity, reputation and integrity of the parliament\u201d, a requirement of the ministerial standards. \u201cThe committee does not believe that the deficiencies in Dr Parkinson\u2019s investigation reflect in any way upon him,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe committee is confident that Dr Parkinson did the job the prime minister expected him to in the manner expected by the prime minister. The problem lies in the prime minister\u2019s expectations.\u201d The ministerial standards are generally considered to be weak. They carry little or no punishment for those who have already departed parliament, and are enforced largely at the whim of the government of the day, not by any independent authority. The crossbench senator Jacqui Lambie warned there was a disconnect between what the \u201cpublic sees as dodgy, but the rules and the ruling class sees as totally acceptable\u201d. On Thursday Lambie called for a gardening leave scheme for departing politicians to be introduced. The scheme would require politicians to stay out of business for a specified cooling-off period, while supporting them with public funds. Those who break the ministerial standards would be compelled to pay parliament back their gardening leave allowance. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about giving ex-ministers sit-down money,\u201d Lambie told Guardian Australia. \u201cIt\u2019s about saying, we\u2019re restricting your ability to do business because you doing business isn\u2019t in the public interest. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to give reasons to abide by the rules after they leave politics. If they don\u2019t have skin in the game, they don\u2019t care if they break the rules.\u201d The Greens, meanwhile, have called for a five-year cooling-off period, with breaches punished by cuts to political pensions. \u201cThe risk of losing their parliamentary pension will have a remarkable impact on focusing ex-ministers away from feathering their own nest and towards opportunities with less conflict-of-interest potential,\u201d the Greens democracy spokeswoman, Larissa Waters, said. Government senators issued a dissenting report, describing the inquiry as a \u201cpartisan exercise\u201d that was unable to uncover anything new. \u201cIn conducting this inquiry, the committee failed to unearth any evidence of wrongdoing or to make a coherent case as to how the ministerial standards have been breached,\u201d they said. Both Pyne and Bishop have consistently denied any suggestion that they were in breach of the standards. The pair said they were well aware of their obligations and intended to comply. Bishop had argued in a submission to the inquiry that the standards would be more workable if the onus was placed on current government officials not to meet with former ministers for 18 months. \u201cThe onus could and arguably should be placed upon current serving officials to not hold meetings with former ministers for the period of 18 months after those ministers cease to hold office,\u201d Bishop said. Freedom of information documents show Bishop\u2019s former department had no idea she was about to be appointed to one of their biggest contractors. Other documents produced to the inquiry show Pyne met with EY while he was still defence minister to discuss a post-politics role. Pyne said he was well within his rights to do so. \u201cHaving a meeting with EY about a future job doesn\u2019t breach the ministerial standards because I wouldn\u2019t have been needing to divulge any information to them that isn\u2019t publicly available and I wasn\u2019t lobbying or advocating or having business meetings,\u201d Pyne told the inquiry earlier this month. Bishop\u2019s time in office was marked by a significant increase in the use of for-profit contractors to deliver Australia\u2019s foreign aid program. About 25% of Australia\u2019s aid spend went to private firms in 2016-17, and the funds were largely shared by 10 major foreign aid contractors. Palladium won the third most contracts of any firm, winning work worth $99m, or about 2.8% of the government\u2019s entire aid spend. Pyne\u2019s new firm, EY, is similarly attempting to capture a bigger portion of Australia\u2019s massive defence spend. Australia is engaged in major defence expenditure on projects like the $50bn future submarines project and $35bn future frigate project. The consulting giant already makes enormous profit from its work for the Australian government. Tender records show in the past four years it has won 838 contracts worth $377m. That includes 138 contracts with the defence department, worth $148m. More money still is available to EY through consulting for other corporations, to help them win and complete government contracts.",

Thankfully Samsung has managed it on the third try.</p> \n<p>The Galaxy Buds are small, light and comfortable earbuds, with a traditional silicone tip on one end and a small body that sits within your concha, even if you have fairly small ears, allowing you to completely forget about them. They come with a series of soft stabilising wings if you need them, but stay put perfectly fine without them.</p> \n<p>A touchpad on the outside takes care of controls. Tap to pause or play, double and triple-tap to skip track. A touch and hold gesture can be switched between turning on or temporarily piping ambient sound into the earbuds, triggering your voice assistant or to change the volume (left to go down, right to turn it up). Take both earbuds out and the music automatically pauses. It all works very well, although I wish you could trigger ambient sound on pause.</p> \n<p>The Galaxy Buds sound pretty good too, with reasonable sound isolation and a well-rounded tone most will like. They\u2019re fairly balanced, not overly dominated by bass or treble, with good separation and punch where needed. The buds are capable of uncomfortable volume levels when cranked right up and there\u2019s a limited EQ available in the Galaxy Wearable app. Audiophiles might turn their noses up, but they sound good compared with the competition at this price.</p> \n<p>Bluetooth connectivity between the buds and to the phone is rock solid, regardless of whether you\u2019re using a Samsung or other phone. They can be used as a stereo pair, individually and hot-swapped between left and right in mono without skipping a beat, even when on a call \u2013 something only Apple\u2019s AirPods have been capable of until now. The Galaxy Buds support AAC and Samsung\u2019s proprietary scalable codec for high-quality music, with no noticeable lipsync issues even when connected to a non-Samsung device. Call quality is good, but a little distant similar to when you\u2019re on speaker phone.</p> \n<p>Even the case is really good. It flips open and closed with a satisfying snap, is small enough to fit in the money pocket of a pair of jeans and provides just over one full charge of the earbuds. Combined that means the Galaxy Buds will last up to six hours of continuous playback with an additional seven hours in the case. In practice that means having to charge them once a week for the commute via the USB-C port or even wireless charging on any Qi-compatible pad or phone.</p> \n<p>Pairing with an Android phone with Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Wearable app installed is as easy as opening them up and waiting for the prompt. Everything else needs a quick trip into the settings menu like any other Bluetooth device. They worked well with various Android phones, PCs, iPads and iPhones.</p> \n<p>When paired with an Android phone you can also get the Galaxy Buds to read out notifications, which is far more useful than it sounds; if you limit the number of apps, that can interrupt your music to just a few. There\u2019s no iOS app for changing settings, which means you need at least one Android, <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/au/support/mobile-devices/updating-galaxy-buds-software-without-mobile-connection/\">PC or Mac</a> in your life to make sure they\u2019re up to date.</p> \n<p><strong>Why should I buy them?</strong></p> \n<p>The Galaxy Buds offer the best combination of sound, connectivity, size, comfort case and price, making them the ones to buy for Android unless you don\u2019t like canal-buds.</p> \n<p><strong>Buy if:</strong> you want a simple set of truly wireless earbuds that just work</p> \n<p><strong>Don\u2019t buy if:</strong> you only use iOS or don\u2019t like canal-buds</p> \n<h2><strong>Best sounding:</strong> Sony WF-1000XM3</h2> \n<p><strong>RRP:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.johnlewis.com/sony-wf-1000xm3-noise-cancelling-true-wireless-bluetooth-nfc-in-ear-headphones-with-mic-remote/black/p4237421\">\u00a3220</a> / <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TD96LY2\">$230</a></p> \n<p>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6263151f30ad9306dfb701506eba508655668ba3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6263151f30ad9306dfb701506eba508655668ba3/504_495_3871_2322/1000.jpg\" alt=\"truly wireless earbuds buyers guide - Sony WF-1000XM3\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brilliant sound, excellent noise cancelling and solid battery life make for a cracking set of true wireless earbuds.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"price comparison of Sony WF-1000XM3\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://m.skimresources.com/widget/skimlinks/pc/iframe/iframe.html?shopId=973&amp;isoCurrencyCode=GBP&amp;isoLanguageCode=en&amp;geolocation=true&amp;nameKeywords=Sony%20WF-1000XM3%20NOT%20xperia&amp;resultLimit=3&amp;pub=114047X1592509&amp;css=rslxksjjea\" name=\"monetizer1\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border:none;height:106px\"> </iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  These regularly updated deals have been sourced through a third-party price comparison service.

The WF-1000XM3 finally live up to the Sony heritage with not only effective noise cancelling but truly great sound too.</p> \n<p>The M3 part of the name aligns them with Sony\u2019s excellent WH-1000XM3 headphones, which have class-leading sound and noise cancelling. The true wireless earbud version inherits the same noise cancelling chip and are almost as effective, reducing or eliminating train, road and plane noise, leaving you free to listen to your music at lower, more comfortable volumes.</p> \n<p>The sound sparkles with detail, energy and clarity, while punchy bass produces a lovely full sound, just edging out the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless.</p> \n<p>Bluetooth 5 means connectivity is strong and lipsync issues have been eliminated. While the design is attractive, particularly in the black and copper colour, the earbuds are massive and took a bit of trial and error to get the fit right with the correct earbud tip (seven pairs are included). Controls are good, but lack volume on the earbud. Touch and hold one to activate ambient passthrough to listen out for announcements.</p> \n<p>Battery life is solid too, lasting up to six hours with noise cancelling active or eight with it off, and up to 32 hours with trips in the case. Like the earbuds the case is also fairly large and difficult to pocket. They\u2019re not cheap, but if you want genuinely great sound, the WF-1000XM3 are the ones to buy.</p> \n<p><strong>Why should you buy them?</strong></p> \n<p>Brilliant sound, excellent noise cancelling and solid connectivity, complemented by solid battery life and an attractive design, the WF-1000XM3 are the best-sounding true wireless earbuds yet.</p> \n<p><strong>Buy if:</strong> you want the best sound and great noise cancelling</p> \n<p><strong>Don\u2019t but if:</strong> you want something smaller and more pocket-friendly</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><strong>Full review:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/14/sony-wf-1000xm3-review-updated-noise-cancelling-earbuds-sound-great\">Sony WF-1000XM3 review: noise-cancelling earbuds sound great</a></p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2><strong>Best non-isolating:</strong> Apple AirPods 2</h2> \n<p><strong>RRP:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MV7N2/airpods-with-charging-case\">\u00a3159</a> or <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MRXJ2ZM/A/airpods-with-wireless-charging-case\">\u00a3199</a> / <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MV7N2/airpods-with-charging-case\">$159</a> or <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MRXJ2/airpods-with-wireless-charging-case\">$199</a></p> \n<p>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76543ce9a58da0c62eff31a68b77a20fa97208db\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76543ce9a58da0c62eff31a68b77a20fa97208db/750_759_3481_2089/1000.jpg\" alt=\"truly wireless earbuds buyers guide - Apple  AirPods\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Apple\u2019s AirPods are some of the most popular wireless earbuds and for good reason.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"price comparison of Apple AirPods\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://m.skimresources.com/widget/skimlinks/pc/iframe/iframe.html?shopId=973&amp;isoCurrencyCode=GBP&amp;isoLanguageCode=en&amp;geolocation=true&amp;nameKeywords=apple%20airpods&amp;resultLimit=3&amp;pub=114047X1592509&amp;css=rslxksjjea&amp;priceMin=110\" name=\"monetizer1\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border:none;height:100%\"> </iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  These regularly updated deals have been sourced through a third-party price comparison service.

As a consequence you can hear everything happening around you meaning you won\u2019t be able to hear your music on something as loud as the tube in London, and if cranked up to maximum they bleed sound, although not as badly as Apple\u2019s non-wireless EarPods. They sound pretty good considering the lack of isolation, with reasonable bass and clarity.</p> \n<p>The AirPods work best with Apple gear, automatically syncing pairing across any Apple devices you might have, but can also be paired with Android or other devices. Connectivity is rock solid with an iPhone and recent Android devices and PCs.</p> \n<p>Where they fall down is on-board controls - there\u2019s basically just one, a double tap. When connected to a non-iPhone it pauses or plays music. Hooked up to an iOS device you have the option to trigger Siri, pause or skip track on each earbud, which means one can summon Siri while the other pauses. There\u2019s no volume control. Take them out and it pauses the music.</p> \n<p>With the second generation AirPods you can also just say \u201cHey Siri\u201d at any time without having to tap anything to activate Apple\u2019s voice assistant. After having to re-teach Siri to recognise my voice, it generally worked well, even with music blasting out. But Siri can be a little slow, particularly when you have poor connectivity on your smartphone. You also get odd looks doing so on public transport.</p> \n<p>The AirPods\u2019 other strengths are that you can use either of the earbuds in mono, call quality is pretty good, and the charging case is the best in the business. The AirPods last about five hours of music and can be fully charged around five times by the case, which itself is charged via a Lightning cable. They are also available with a new wireless charging case (\u00a340/$40 extra) for powering up on Qi-compatible chargers.</p> \n<p><strong>Why should I buy them?</strong></p> \n<p>Seamless connectivity with Apple products is key, but they sound pretty good, have an excellent case and are a decent alternative to canal-buds, even for Android users</p> \n<p><strong>Buy if:</strong> you use Apple products and don\u2019t need sound isolation</p> \n<p><strong>Don\u2019t buy if:</strong> you want to block out the sounds outside world</p> \n<h2><strong>Best for size:</strong> Earin M-2</h2> \n<p><strong>RRP:</strong> <a href=\"https://store.earin.com/gbp\">\u00a3219</a> / <a href=\"https://store.earin.com/usd/\">$249</a></p> \n<p>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7fa8974136554b8bcabfa93ec81e207d0f2c7753\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7fa8974136554b8bcabfa93ec81e207d0f2c7753/758_578_3652_2191/1000.jpg\" alt=\"truly wireless earbuds buyers guide - earin m-2\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Earin\u2019s second-generation truly wireless earbuds are tiny, with solid sound and connectivity.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>If you want the smallest, most discreet wireless earbuds available, the Earin M-2 deliver. These tiny earbuds sit within your ear with only a flat touch-sensitive surface visible.</p> \n<p>Available in black or white, they\u2019re light and easy to forget you\u2019re wearing them. They produce a balanced, relatively flat sound with good treble and fairly crisp highs. Those looking for pumping bass or truly sparkling audio will have to look elsewhere, but they make a good go of most music genres.</p> \n<p>An Android or iOS app sorts updates, and tweaks transparency settings, but there are no equaliser settings.</p> \n<p>Noise isolation is good but not great. The M-2s can feed ambient sound in when the music pauses, but it sounds like you\u2019re listening to the world down an old phone line - fine for listening to an announcement but it takes some getting used to.</p> \n<p>Unusually, there\u2019s no left or right earbud. They can be inserted in either ear with the buds working out which way round they are, and either can be used on its own for mono listening. They support AAC and aptX, and maintain a stable connection to your phone and between the earbuds, which communicate via magnetic induction, not Bluetooth. The result is lag and lipsync issue-free audio. Call quality is good, but a little quiet, meaning you\u2019ll have to speak up, and there\u2019s no sidetone, so it\u2019s difficult to know how loud you\u2019re talking.</p> \n<p>Tap once to pause, twice to skip track or tap and hold to invoke Google Assistant or Siri on either bud. The controls work well, but there\u2019s no volume control at all, so you\u2019ll have to reach for your phone for that.</p> \n<p>They last a good three hours of constant playback and charge about three times in the cylindrical aluminium case, which slides open and shut with a satisfying clunk.</p> \n<p><strong>Why should you buy them?</strong></p> \n<p>If you want your truly wireless earbuds to be as small as possible, but still have good sound, great connectivity and a good case, the Earin M-2 are it.</p> \n<p><strong>Buy if:</strong> you want the the smallest of truly wireless earbuds</p> \n<p><strong>Don\u2019t buy if:</strong> you want a smaller case or better sound</p> \n<h2>Best for sport: Beats PowerBeats Pro</h2> \n<p><strong>RRP:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MV6Y2ZM/A/powerbeats-pro-totally-wireless-earphones-black\">\u00a3219.95</a> / <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MV6Y2LL/A/powerbeats-pro-totally-wireless-earphones-black\">$249.95</a></p> \n<p>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cfd55d2fd676eeab826f76eb359ce3bc3baf1b80\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cfd55d2fd676eeab826f76eb359ce3bc3baf1b80/473_247_4052_2432/1000.jpg\" alt=\"truly wireless earbuds buyers guide - Beats PowerBeats Pro\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Unshakeable attachment to your ear, good sound, long battery life, excellent connectivity and proper volume controls make these Beats a winner.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"price comparison of Beats PowerBeats Pro\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://m.skimresources.com/widget/skimlinks/pc/iframe/iframe.html?shopId=973&amp;isoCurrencyCode=GBP&amp;isoLanguageCode=en&amp;geolocation=true&amp;nameKeywords=beats%20powerbeats%20pro&amp;resultLimit=3&amp;pub=114047X1592509&amp;css=rslxksjjea\" name=\"monetizer1\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border:none;height:133px\"> </iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  These regularly updated deals have been sourced through a third-party price comparison service.

Rock solid connectivity in all conditions is paired with excellent controls. Both earbuds have proper volume rocker controls, plus a multifunction button for controlling playback, skipping tracks or activating Siri or Google Assistant.</p> \n<p>The flexible ear hook loops over the back of your ear and with a bit of adjustment holds them firmly in place on your head - no amount of jumping, giggling or pounding the tarmac is going to shake these free. They\u2019re also sweat resistant so will be fine in the rain or hard workout; just don\u2019t run them under a tap.</p> \n<p>The silicone earbud tip offers some isolation from the world around you. The forward, energetic sound is ideal for powering through a run or gym session, while also doing a good job with most music genres, banishing the all-bass Beats sound profile to the history books.</p> \n<p>Call quality is excellent too, while battery life is a class-leading eight hours with another 1.5 charges in the case.</p> \n<p>The enormous case is the worst thing about them. It\u2019s robust and works just fine, but you\u2019re not going to be able to fit it in a pocket. They\u2019re also pricy, so if you just want basic buds for the gym, these aren\u2019t for you.</p> \n<p><strong>Why should you buy them?</strong></p> \n<p>You want the AirPod-like convenience of connectivity and features with an iPhone (or Android with app), with class-leading battery, good sound, excellent controls including a real volume rocker, plus an ear hook design that\u2019s unshakeable.</p> \n<p><strong>Buy if:</strong> you want rock-solid all-rounders that won\u2019t come off no matter what you do</p> \n<p><strong>Don\u2019t but if:</strong> you want something smaller and cheaper</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><strong>Full review:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/19/beats-powerbeats-pro-review-apple-fitness-airpods-rock\">Beats PowerBeats Pro review: Apple\u2019s fitness AirPods rock</a></p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2><strong>Best budget option:</strong> Creative Outlier Air</h2> \n<p><strong>RRP:</strong> <a href=\"https://uk.creative.com/p/headphones-headsets/creative-outlier-air#buy\">\u00a369.99</a> / <a href=\"https://us.creative.com/p/headphones-headsets/creative-outlier-air#buy\">$79.99</a></p> \n<p>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"93aa9ce4aed269bafd75e538b4d20a868eac3c05\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93aa9ce4aed269bafd75e538b4d20a868eac3c05/603_522_3677_2207/1000.jpg\" alt=\"truly wireless earbuds buyers guide - Creative Outlier Air\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Good sound, long battery life and solid connection make the Creative Outlier Air great for the money.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Creative, known for PC soundcards and MP3 players from the 90s and 2000s and now gaming headsets and headphones, produces some of the best value true wireless earbuds around.</p> \n<p>The Creative Outlier Air (also available in a more expensive \u201cgold\u201d variant) manage to tick almost every box. They\u2019re light and comfortable to wear for extended periods, with a kidney shape that keeps most of the hard plastic body away from the fleshy bits of your ears. A traditional silicone earbud tip holds it in place fairly well, but only two sets are included in the box, meaning you might need to buy some extra ones if it doesn\u2019t make a good enough seal.</p> \n<p>They have excellent connectivity with Bluetooth 5, SBC, AAC and aptX support, can be used independently and best of all last up to 10 hours between trips in the case, which is about double the average battery life of most true wireless earbuds.</p> \n<p>The case is fairly big, but is light, just about pocketable and holds two full charges of the earbuds, making up to 30 hours before needing to be topped up by USB-C.</p> \n<p>The Outlier Air sound surprisingly good for the money too, producing well-rounded audio with punch in the bass (once you get a good seal at least) and good clarity in the mids and highs. They won\u2019t touch the best-sounding, but they are a cut above the competition at this price and will even give the likes of the Galaxy Buds and AirPods a run for their money.</p> \n<p>A button on either bud takes care of playback and volume control, which is a bit stiff, requiring you to grip the bud with your index finger and press the button with your thumb. Press once to pause/play, twice on the left to skip back or on the right to skip forward.

Many early versions could not maintain a solid connection and therefore had frequent, annoying dropouts.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Bluetooth codec support</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>A codec is the system used to transmit the audio signal over the Bluetooth connection which both the phone and headphones must support. There are a variety of codecs available for Bluetooth headphones, with SBC being the default, which is the lowest quality and supported by all Bluetooth audio devices. AAC is an upgrade that most support, with Sony's LDAC and Qualcomm's aptX, aptX HD, aptX Low Latency and the newest aptX Adaptive supported by some.</p>\n    <p>Apple's iPhone notably does not support Bluetooth codecs higher than AAC, but many Android smartphones and newer Bluetooth headphones support at least aptX.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Latency</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Along with variances in audio quality, different codecs have different latency in their transmission of sound. Latency is the time it takes for a sound to be sent to the earphone and be played, which is important because if it is too high the audio track does not match up with video, leading to irritating lipsync issues.</p>\n    <p>Most headphones that only support SBC will have lipsync issues, while AAC and higher can help negate the problem.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Ambient sound</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Some earbuds have the ability to play sounds from the outside world picked up by microphones through the speakers, providing an awareness of what's happening in the world through the earbuds. Some automatically activate ambient sound on pause, while others can mix it with music or have dedicated modes for listening out for announcements or similar.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Battery life</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Each earbud has to have a battery in it, therefore to squeeze everything into a small enough package to fit in your ear has mean small batteries and fairly short runtimes. But they are not all born equally with some lasting as much as five hours between charges.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Case</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Short battery life and lack of wires means most truly wireless earbuds come with a charging case with an integrated battery to keep the earbuds safe and topped up. Some charging cases are huge and heavy, others small and light - important to note if you want to carry it in your pocket.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Fit</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Most will have a canal-bud design with an ear tip of varying sizes that enters the ear canal. Alongside the tip many have wings or a body design that is intended to lock into the hollow next to the ear canal called the concha to hold it in place.</p>\n    <p>Here is where the most comfort problems arise, as too much pressure on the soft bits of the ear around the concha will cause pain.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Runners up</h2> \n<p>These truly wireless earbuds are still worth buying, if the top five don\u2019t fit the bill.</p> \n<p><strong>Anker Soundcore Liberty Air</strong></p> \n<p><strong>RRP:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07GWVPYHN\">\u00a379.99</a> / <a href=\"https://www.soundcore.com/products/variant/liberty-air/A3902011\">$79.99</a></p> \n<p>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d0c3c07c15cfcda706ec6b51c8f1681d89168292\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d0c3c07c15cfcda706ec6b51c8f1681d89168292/1431_668_2048_2048/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anker Soundcore Liberty Air\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anker Soundcore Liberty Air</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Anker\u2019s AirPod-like true wireless earbuds are second only to the Creative Outlier Air as the best budget option.

      "bodyText": "It wasn\u2019t long ago that true wireless earbuds, those that don\u2019t need any wires even between the earphones, weren\u2019t very good. Solid connectivity was a challenge, dropouts were infuriatingly common and battery life was woeful. But they all offered that taste of freedom from wires that is like a ratchet \u2013 once you\u2019ve experienced tangle-free listening, you\u2019ll never go back. Now there are loads of truly wireless earbuds on the market offering all sorts of features, designs and sound. None of them are bargain basement, and it\u2019s difficult to know which ones are worth buying. So here\u2019s a guide to separate the wheat from the chaff. This Guardian buyer\u2019s guide to true wireless earbuds was last updated on 26 September, and represents the best available models at the time. As new models are released and tested, this guide will be updated to help you choose the right earbuds for you. Best all-round: Samsung Galaxy Buds RRP: \u00a3139 / $130 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Nailing the combination of connectivity, sound, in-ear comfort, controls and case size has proved far more difficult for truly wireless earbuds than you might expect. Thankfully Samsung has managed it on the third try. The Galaxy Buds are small, light and comfortable earbuds, with a traditional silicone tip on one end and a small body that sits within your concha, even if you have fairly small ears, allowing you to completely forget about them. They come with a series of soft stabilising wings if you need them, but stay put perfectly fine without them. A touchpad on the outside takes care of controls. Tap to pause or play, double and triple-tap to skip track. A touch and hold gesture can be switched between turning on or temporarily piping ambient sound into the earbuds, triggering your voice assistant or to change the volume (left to go down, right to turn it up). Take both earbuds out and the music automatically pauses. It all works very well, although I wish you could trigger ambient sound on pause. The Galaxy Buds sound pretty good too, with reasonable sound isolation and a well-rounded tone most will like. They\u2019re fairly balanced, not overly dominated by bass or treble, with good separation and punch where needed. The buds are capable of uncomfortable volume levels when cranked right up and there\u2019s a limited EQ available in the Galaxy Wearable app. Audiophiles might turn their noses up, but they sound good compared with the competition at this price. Bluetooth connectivity between the buds and to the phone is rock solid, regardless of whether you\u2019re using a Samsung or other phone. They can be used as a stereo pair, individually and hot-swapped between left and right in mono without skipping a beat, even when on a call \u2013 something only Apple\u2019s AirPods have been capable of until now. The Galaxy Buds support AAC and Samsung\u2019s proprietary scalable codec for high-quality music, with no noticeable lipsync issues even when connected to a non-Samsung device. Call quality is good, but a little distant similar to when you\u2019re on speaker phone. Even the case is really good. It flips open and closed with a satisfying snap, is small enough to fit in the money pocket of a pair of jeans and provides just over one full charge of the earbuds. Combined that means the Galaxy Buds will last up to six hours of continuous playback with an additional seven hours in the case. In practice that means having to charge them once a week for the commute via the USB-C port or even wireless charging on any Qi-compatible pad or phone. Pairing with an Android phone with Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Wearable app installed is as easy as opening them up and waiting for the prompt. Everything else needs a quick trip into the settings menu like any other Bluetooth device. They worked well with various Android phones, PCs, iPads and iPhones. When paired with an Android phone you can also get the Galaxy Buds to read out notifications, which is far more useful than it sounds; if you limit the number of apps, that can interrupt your music to just a few. There\u2019s no iOS app for changing settings, which means you need at least one Android, PC or Mac in your life to make sure they\u2019re up to date. Why should I buy them? The Galaxy Buds offer the best combination of sound, connectivity, size, comfort case and price, making them the ones to buy for Android unless you don\u2019t like canal-buds. Buy if: you want a simple set of truly wireless earbuds that just work Don\u2019t buy if: you only use iOS or don\u2019t like canal-buds Best sounding: Sony WF-1000XM3 RRP: \u00a3220 / $230 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Third time\u2019s the charm for Sony. The WF-1000XM3 finally live up to the Sony heritage with not only effective noise cancelling but truly great sound too. The M3 part of the name aligns them with Sony\u2019s excellent WH-1000XM3 headphones, which have class-leading sound and noise cancelling. The true wireless earbud version inherits the same noise cancelling chip and are almost as effective, reducing or eliminating train, road and plane noise, leaving you free to listen to your music at lower, more comfortable volumes. The sound sparkles with detail, energy and clarity, while punchy bass produces a lovely full sound, just edging out the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless. Bluetooth 5 means connectivity is strong and lipsync issues have been eliminated. While the design is attractive, particularly in the black and copper colour, the earbuds are massive and took a bit of trial and error to get the fit right with the correct earbud tip (seven pairs are included). Controls are good, but lack volume on the earbud. Touch and hold one to activate ambient passthrough to listen out for announcements. Battery life is solid too, lasting up to six hours with noise cancelling active or eight with it off, and up to 32 hours with trips in the case. Like the earbuds the case is also fairly large and difficult to pocket. They\u2019re not cheap, but if you want genuinely great sound, the WF-1000XM3 are the ones to buy. Why should you buy them? Brilliant sound, excellent noise cancelling and solid connectivity, complemented by solid battery life and an attractive design, the WF-1000XM3 are the best-sounding true wireless earbuds yet. Buy if: you want the best sound and great noise cancelling Don\u2019t but if: you want something smaller and more pocket-friendly Full review: Sony WF-1000XM3 review: noise-cancelling earbuds sound great Best non-isolating: Apple AirPods 2 RRP: \u00a3159 or \u00a3199 / $159 or $199 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 If you don\u2019t like blocking out the world, or can\u2019t get on with canal-bud style earphones that enter your ear, look no further than Apple\u2019s AirPods, now in their second generation. They gently rest in your ear with little white stalks sticking down, projecting the sound down your ear holes rather than sitting directly in them. As a consequence you can hear everything happening around you meaning you won\u2019t be able to hear your music on something as loud as the tube in London, and if cranked up to maximum they bleed sound, although not as badly as Apple\u2019s non-wireless EarPods. They sound pretty good considering the lack of isolation, with reasonable bass and clarity. The AirPods work best with Apple gear, automatically syncing pairing across any Apple devices you might have, but can also be paired with Android or other devices. Connectivity is rock solid with an iPhone and recent Android devices and PCs. Where they fall down is on-board controls - there\u2019s basically just one, a double tap. When connected to a non-iPhone it pauses or plays music. Hooked up to an iOS device you have the option to trigger Siri, pause or skip track on each earbud, which means one can summon Siri while the other pauses. There\u2019s no volume control. Take them out and it pauses the music. With the second generation AirPods you can also just say \u201cHey Siri\u201d at any time without having to tap anything to activate Apple\u2019s voice assistant. After having to re-teach Siri to recognise my voice, it generally worked well, even with music blasting out. But Siri can be a little slow, particularly when you have poor connectivity on your smartphone. You also get odd looks doing so on public transport. The AirPods\u2019 other strengths are that you can use either of the earbuds in mono, call quality is pretty good, and the charging case is the best in the business. The AirPods last about five hours of music and can be fully charged around five times by the case, which itself is charged via a Lightning cable. They are also available with a new wireless charging case (\u00a340/$40 extra) for powering up on Qi-compatible chargers. Why should I buy them? Seamless connectivity with Apple products is key, but they sound pretty good, have an excellent case and are a decent alternative to canal-buds, even for Android users Buy if: you use Apple products and don\u2019t need sound isolation Don\u2019t buy if: you want to block out the sounds outside world Best for size: Earin M-2 RRP: \u00a3219 / $249 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 If you want the smallest, most discreet wireless earbuds available, the Earin M-2 deliver. These tiny earbuds sit within your ear with only a flat touch-sensitive surface visible. Available in black or white, they\u2019re light and easy to forget you\u2019re wearing them. They produce a balanced, relatively flat sound with good treble and fairly crisp highs. Those looking for pumping bass or truly sparkling audio will have to look elsewhere, but they make a good go of most music genres. An Android or iOS app sorts updates, and tweaks transparency settings, but there are no equaliser settings. Noise isolation is good but not great. The M-2s can feed ambient sound in when the music pauses, but it sounds like you\u2019re listening to the world down an old phone line - fine for listening to an announcement but it takes some getting used to. Unusually, there\u2019s no left or right earbud. They can be inserted in either ear with the buds working out which way round they are, and either can be used on its own for mono listening. They support AAC and aptX, and maintain a stable connection to your phone and between the earbuds, which communicate via magnetic induction, not Bluetooth. The result is lag and lipsync issue-free audio. Call quality is good, but a little quiet, meaning you\u2019ll have to speak up, and there\u2019s no sidetone, so it\u2019s difficult to know how loud you\u2019re talking. Tap once to pause, twice to skip track or tap and hold to invoke Google Assistant or Siri on either bud. The controls work well, but there\u2019s no volume control at all, so you\u2019ll have to reach for your phone for that. They last a good three hours of constant playback and charge about three times in the cylindrical aluminium case, which slides open and shut with a satisfying clunk. Why should you buy them? If you want your truly wireless earbuds to be as small as possible, but still have good sound, great connectivity and a good case, the Earin M-2 are it. Buy if: you want the the smallest of truly wireless earbuds Don\u2019t buy if: you want a smaller case or better sound Best for sport: Beats PowerBeats Pro RRP: \u00a3219.95 / $249.95 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 If you wish Apple\u2019s AirPods had better isolation and gripped on to your ear like a vice, look no further than the Beats PowerBeats Pro. Like the AirPods the PowerBeats Pro have great connectivity with an iPhone, which courtesy of the Beats app even extends to Android. Rock solid connectivity in all conditions is paired with excellent controls. Both earbuds have proper volume rocker controls, plus a multifunction button for controlling playback, skipping tracks or activating Siri or Google Assistant. The flexible ear hook loops over the back of your ear and with a bit of adjustment holds them firmly in place on your head - no amount of jumping, giggling or pounding the tarmac is going to shake these free. They\u2019re also sweat resistant so will be fine in the rain or hard workout; just don\u2019t run them under a tap. The silicone earbud tip offers some isolation from the world around you. The forward, energetic sound is ideal for powering through a run or gym session, while also doing a good job with most music genres, banishing the all-bass Beats sound profile to the history books. Call quality is excellent too, while battery life is a class-leading eight hours with another 1.5 charges in the case. The enormous case is the worst thing about them. It\u2019s robust and works just fine, but you\u2019re not going to be able to fit it in a pocket. They\u2019re also pricy, so if you just want basic buds for the gym, these aren\u2019t for you. Why should you buy them? You want the AirPod-like convenience of connectivity and features with an iPhone (or Android with app), with class-leading battery, good sound, excellent controls including a real volume rocker, plus an ear hook design that\u2019s unshakeable. Buy if: you want rock-solid all-rounders that won\u2019t come off no matter what you do Don\u2019t but if: you want something smaller and cheaper Full review: Beats PowerBeats Pro review: Apple\u2019s fitness AirPods rock Best budget option: Creative Outlier Air RRP: \u00a369.99 / $79.99 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 Creative, known for PC soundcards and MP3 players from the 90s and 2000s and now gaming headsets and headphones, produces some of the best value true wireless earbuds around. The Creative Outlier Air (also available in a more expensive \u201cgold\u201d variant) manage to tick almost every box. They\u2019re light and comfortable to wear for extended periods, with a kidney shape that keeps most of the hard plastic body away from the fleshy bits of your ears. A traditional silicone earbud tip holds it in place fairly well, but only two sets are included in the box, meaning you might need to buy some extra ones if it doesn\u2019t make a good enough seal. They have excellent connectivity with Bluetooth 5, SBC, AAC and aptX support, can be used independently and best of all last up to 10 hours between trips in the case, which is about double the average battery life of most true wireless earbuds. The case is fairly big, but is light, just about pocketable and holds two full charges of the earbuds, making up to 30 hours before needing to be topped up by USB-C. The Outlier Air sound surprisingly good for the money too, producing well-rounded audio with punch in the bass (once you get a good seal at least) and good clarity in the mids and highs. They won\u2019t touch the best-sounding, but they are a cut above the competition at this price and will even give the likes of the Galaxy Buds and AirPods a run for their money. A button on either bud takes care of playback and volume control, which is a bit stiff, requiring you to grip the bud with your index finger and press the button with your thumb. Press once to pause/play, twice on the left to skip back or on the right to skip forward. Pressing and holding on the left turns the volume down or on the right turns the volume up. Call quality is surprisingly good, with only a little bit of background noise audible by the recipient while speaking. The earbuds are also IPX5 sweat-proof so fine for a run or similar. Small niggles include poor selection of earbud tips, a slight hiss on pause and hints of lipsync issues with Amazon Prime Video and YouTube. Why should you buy them? Great sound, connectivity and long battery life, plus solid controls including volume, combine with an OK case to make some excellent value true wireless earbuds. Buy if: you want great-sounding truly wireless earbuds on a budget Don\u2019t buy if: you want a small case (buy the Anker Liberty Air instead) Runners up These truly wireless earbuds are still worth buying, if the top five don\u2019t fit the bill. Anker Soundcore Liberty Air RRP: \u00a379.99 / $79.99 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 Anker\u2019s AirPod-like true wireless earbuds are second only to the Creative Outlier Air as the best budget option. They have good but not great sound, solid connectivity and AAC support in a light and comfortable earbud design with stalks. Controls are basic, with no volume control, but call quality is excellent and the case is one of the smaller and easier to pocket variety. You\u2019ll get four hours out of the earbuds and an extra three charges in the case. Anker Soundcore Liberty Neo RRP: \u00a359.99 / $49.99 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 Anker\u2019s smaller true wireless earbuds are an excellent budget option, but have a larger case and are bettered on sound and call quality by the Liberty Air. They can be found for slightly cheaper and don\u2019t have the AirPod-like stalk design, so are still worth buying if the price or earbud design suits you better. Not good for phone calls though. B&amp;O E8 2.0 RRP: \u00a3300 / $350 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 B&amp;O\u2019s second-generation E8 are a solid mix of sound quality and connectivity with a fairly small case. They last just under four hours\u2019 playtime, with two full charges in the case, which itself is charged via USB-C or Qi wireless charging. Touch panels on each earbud take care of controls, including volume, and they have an reasonable transparency mode too. They support AAC, can connect to two devices simultaneously, but can\u2019t be used independently. Call quality is reasonable. The biggest issue is their size: the E8s are massive for earbuds and don\u2019t feel all that stable in your ears unless you use the included Comply foam tips. They\u2019re also expensive and bettered by the Sennheisers on the audio quality front. Bose SoundSport Free RRP: \u00a3179.95 / $199.95 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 If you want more isolation than the AirPods but can\u2019t get on with canal-bud style tips, the Bose SoundSport Free provide a good halfway house. The StayHear+ tips rest in your concha but don\u2019t enter your ear canal, holding themselves in-place with a flexible fin. They sound good, connectivity is rock solid with AAC support, call quality is really good, and they last more than four hours between charges. The large case provides two full charges. The biggest problem is that they\u2019re huge and stick out your ear a mile. At least the call quality is good. Cambridge Audio Melomania 1 RRP: \u00a3119.95 / $129.95 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 The Cambridge Audio Melomania 1 come very close to delivering on all counts. They have rock-solid Bluetooth 5 connectivity with AAC and aptX support, long eight-hour battery, good controls including a way to adjust volume and they even sound good, with balanced, rounded audio. The case is also one of the best available, adding up to 36 hours of playback to the earbuds while still being very pocketable, fitting into the money pocket of a pair of jeans long with only a handful of the best. The problem is, they\u2019re huge. They have a really large aperture making getting the earbud tip to fit without blocking your ear canal a bit of a chore and they stick out a mile, looking like something Nichelle Nichols\u2019s Uhura would use in classic Star Trek. The big trunk is uncomfortable in my ears, meaning any 30-minute-plus listening becomes painful. A real shame. Jabra Elite 65t RRP: \u00a3149.99 / $169.99 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 The Jabra Elite 65t are a good alternative to the Samsung Galaxy Buds. They have rock-solid connectivity, support for AAC, no noticeable lipsync issues and sound good, with punchy, controlled bass plus a full equaliser in the Jabra Sound+ app. There are volume/track skip buttons on the left earbud and a pause/play button on the right, which activates ambient sound when double pressed. Call quality is good with clear voice, but background noise bleeds into the mic a little. The case is pretty compact and charges the buds twice totalling to 12 hours\u2019 playback. The Elite 65t twist to lock in place in the ear, but are fairly large and uncomfortable for longer listening sessions for smaller ears. Libratone Track Air+ RRP: \u00a3179 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Some of the best true wireless earbuds available, the Track Air+ are narrowly beaten by the Samsung Galaxy Buds for general earbuds on price and Sony\u2019s WF-1000XM3 on noise cancelling. The Libratones have it all: attractive design, rock-solid Bluetooth 5 connectivity with aptX support, great sound and even reasonably effective noise cancelling. Add to that a tiny case that\u2019ll fit in the money pocket of a pair of jeans just like the Galaxy Buds and AirPods, and has wireless charging. Plus battery life of just shy of six hours and three charges in the case. They\u2019re even sweat resistant. The downsides are lack of volume control on the earbuds, lack of AAC support for an iPhone and an easily marked case. Still, if you wish Apple made noise-cancelling AirPods with silicone earbud tips for a better fit, the Libratone Track Air+ are the ones to buy. Full review: Libratone Track Air+ review: the noise-cancelling AirPods Apple won\u2019t give you Master and Dynamic MW07 RRP: \u00a3280 / $300 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 If the Sennheiser Momentum Wireless don\u2019t fit the bill but you want great sound, then the Master and Dynamic MW07 are worth a look. They sound good, with pronounced bass and crisp highs, but fall slightly short of the better-sounding Sennheiser. There\u2019s a slight hiss when nothing is playing, but have rock-solid connectivity with AAC and aptX support. The buds are also fairly large and certainly a statement in piano gloss. The wings are a bit uncomfortable, but I didn\u2019t need them. The case is medium sized, and feels good in the hand, but is heavy and the earbuds don\u2019t quite snap into place unless the lid is closed. Physical buttons for controls are great, including volume. Calls sounded echoey. RHA TrueConnect RRP: \u00a3149.95 / $169.95 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 Like black Apple AirPods but with a traditional isolating earbud on the end to enter your ear, the RHA TrueConnect sound good with strong bass and solid isolation, but poor call quality. Connectivity is pretty good including AAC support, with only a very occasional blip while suffering only minimal lipsync issues with video. Latency is more of an issue with games. They last four hours per charge, with four full charges in an attractive, medium-sized case. A button on each earbud handles volume, track skip, pause, play and the voice assistant all accessible with multiple clicks. The button felt mushy on one set requiring replacement. Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless RRP: \u00a3280 / $300 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Previously ranked as the best-sounding true wireless earbuds, the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless are still great. The earbuds are quite large, but are comfortable with a solid set of earbud tips. They last up to four hours between trips in the case, which itself is one of the better ones, although not quite as pocketable as the best. Connectivity is excellent, supporting Bluetooth 5 with AAC, aptX and the new aptX Low Latency codecs, and no hint of latency issues. Call quality was good but a bit distant. Silver touch pads handle playback and volume control. The best bit is how they sound: rich, lively and warm, with produce crisp highs and deep bass, sounding great with most music genres.

Of the approximately 30,000 people who live in Parc-Ex, 61% were born outside Canada. The area is one of the country\u2019s poorest: 43% of households live below the poverty line, perhaps a somewhat surprising fact given that it is also part of the Papineau electoral district represented by Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau .</p> <p>Despite being located in the centre of bustling Montreal, Parc-Ex feels isolated and is physically closed off from the rest of the city by borders on all sides. There\u2019s a highway to the north, a large park to the east, train tracks to the south and a fence to the west, built by a posher neighbouring borough.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The arrival of the University of Montreal has created havoc</p> <footer> <cite>Parc-Ex resident</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This month, however, Parc-Ex is being plugged back into the heart of the city in a project that some are hailing as transformative but othersfear will gentrify the district beyond recognition, pushing out current residents.</p> <p>The project, dubbed Mil, is a C$348m (\u00a3210m) development by the University of Montreal which will transform a 38 hectare site that was formerly old rail yard into a vast new campus. Mil stands for Montreal Innovation Laboratory, but also plays on the word <em>milieu</em> (middle), a nod to its city centre location.</p> <p>The first stage of the development is now open: a new complex for the university\u2019s science department, which hosts a daily influx of 2,200 students, faculty and staff. The next stage of development will include condominiums, office buildings and public spaces.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9926c94c9f7b41d212fc08edadcee082110aa211\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9926c94c9f7b41d212fc08edadcee082110aa211/0_93_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The first stage of the Mil development is now open and hosts 2,200 students, faculty and staff daily.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The first stage of the Mil development is now open and hosts 2,200 students, faculty and staff daily.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Bruxelle/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Beyond the rare opportunity for a city to develop 53 football pitches\u2019 worth of prime real estate, Mil is intended to bolster Montreal\u2019s reputation as a hub for AI research. The new campus will be located close to the university\u2019s AI research centre, Mila, in the nearby industrial Marconi-Alexandra area. The hope is that Parc-Ex will become the next Mile End, a Montreal neighbourhood transformed by the arrival of game giant Ubisoft.</p> <p>The government is investing C$84m into the Mil project, and Trudeau has promoted the plan as a way of boosting Montreal\u2019s intellectual capital as a cornerstone of economic growth.</p> <p>In turn, the university is portraying Mil as a lifeline for Parc-Ex. The development will see the district connected to the well-off, mostly Francophone, borough of Outremont via a pedestrian bridge over the tracks.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe that opening up neighbourhoods and sectors contributes to improving people\u2019s quality of life,\u201d says university spokesperson Genevi\u00e8ve O\u2019Meara.</p> <p>But as the campus opens, Parc-Ex residents are grappling with the consequences of their neighbourhood\u2019s newfound attractiveness. New condo developments are multiplying near the subway station, and homeowners report being pressured into selling their properties by developers. In recent months, the community group Comit\u00e9 d\u2019Action de Parc-Extension (Cape) has documented a spike in evictions and unlawful rent increases.</p> <p>To make matters worse, Montreal is in the midst of a housing crunch, and vacancy rates in Parc-Ex are <a href=\"https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/gentrification-brings-rising-rent-to-notoriously-affordable-park-ex-1.4489018\">at an all-time low</a>, leaving displaced residents scrambling to find affordable housing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4a36caf92b5204a6e7678e7cda7990e09c308301\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a36caf92b5204a6e7678e7cda7990e09c308301/0_161_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The science complex on the University of Montreal\u2019s new Mil campus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The science complex on the University of Montreal\u2019s new Mil campus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Bruxelle/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One resident of Parc-Ex who was evicted earlier this year found herself in a frantic search for new housing for her two sons, one of whom has a disability and attends a special school. \u201cIt was just a horrible, horrible experience being in this mad rush of people just panicking and trying to get a place,\u201d she says. Eventually she found an apartment. It costs C$400 (\u00a3242) more per month than her previous residence, and is roughly half the size.</p> <p>\u201cI just became desperate,\u201d she says of her decision to accept the new, worse reality. \u201cI was so afraid of becoming homeless.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018Parc-Ex was an anomaly\u2019</h2> <p>Until now, Parc-Ex has remained mostly immune to the gentrification forces that have filled Montreal with hip coffee shops, cocktail bars and yoga studios. It is a lively, unassuming neighbourhood, with tree-lined residential streets filled with low-rise apartments, shops catering to multiple ethnic groups, and numerous places of worship. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Most people here earn the minimum wage, some are on welfare. If the university brings improvements, they won\u2019t benefit those people</p> <footer> <cite>Parc-Ex resident</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is also a precarious place. While older generations of immigrants (notably a large Greek population) were able to buy their homes, 78% of today\u2019s residents are renters. Many of the newcomers from south-east Asia, Africa and the Caribbean are those seeking refugee status, undocumented migrants, temporary workers and immigrants of colour \u2013 all groups who face higher barriers to integration.</p> <p>\u201cParc-Ex was sort of an anomaly,\u201d says Rachel Shugart, a Parc-Ex resident and former program director of the <a href=\"https://www.welcomecollective.org/\">Welcome Collective</a>, a nonprofit group that helps refugee claimants through their first few months in Montreal.</p> <p>\u201cThe apartments that are available for the poorest, most vulnerable families are only low-price, despite their central position, despite their walkability, because the buildings are in such bad shape. They\u2019re really terrible apartments, and nobody else would take them if they had any other options.\u201d</p> <p>In 2011, the city\u2019s public health department found that 25.9% of Parc-Ex families with young children were<a href=\"https://santemontreal.qc.ca/fileadmin/fichiers/professionnels/DRSP/Directeur/Rapports/Rapport_ISS-2011.pdf\"> living in housing infested with cockroaches</a>. Bugs, mice, rats, mould and other problems are common, and the city has launched a campaign to send more inspectors after neglectful landlords.</p> <p>But while Montreal had until now avoided the worst of the housing inflation that has seized other large Canadian cities, thanks in part to generous tenant laws that cap rent increases and restrict evictions, times are changing. Property prices are <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-rental-market-cmhc-1.4925890\">rising</a>, putting additional pressure on Parc-Ex.</p> <p>\u201cThe real estate market has been gaining momentum for a dozen years, but in the past two years, it\u2019s been disproportionate,\u201d says Faiz Abhuani. Abuhani runs <a href=\"http://www.briqueparbrique.com/en/brickbybrick/\">Brick by Brick</a>, which raises community bonds to purchase properties and turn them into affordable housing in Parc-Ex. The spike in prices, he says, has dashed his hopes of making deals any time soon.</p> <p>Now, the Mil project is bringing that pressure directly into the heart of Parc-Ex.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"699a22a947e9a9b6420820a096647eec32b31272\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/699a22a947e9a9b6420820a096647eec32b31272/0_7_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Is the new university development a lifeline for isolated, impoverished Parc-Ex or problematic gentrification?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Is the new university development a lifeline for isolated, impoverished Parc-Ex or problematic gentrification?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Hughes/The Canadian Press/PA Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are no official statistics on rent increases or evictions, but Cape says it helped close to 500 tenants in the first half of 2019. Of those, 21 were being pushed out illegally and 16 had been pressured to leave. Since last year there has been \u201ca significant increase in the number of people coming to see us for questions relating to rent increases, repossessions, and major renovations,\u201d says Cape\u2019s Amy Darwish.</p> <p>The tension is also being ratcheted up by Montreal\u2019s long-time effort to create jobs and raise the tax base by attracting the tech, creative and knowledge industries. Mile End quickly gentrified after Ubisoft moved in, aided by tax credits. As Mil opens there is also a push to attract AI companies to the Marconi-Alexandra area where the University of Montreal\u2019s Mila research centre is located, as well as companies such as Element AI; in September Microsoft will <a href=\"https://news.microsoft.com/en-ca/features/microsoft-research-montreal-moves-to-montreal-ai-hub/\">move into a new research lab</a> a short walk away from Mil.</p> <p>Mil itself represents a \u201cquick fix\u201d for the city to raise revenue, says Norma Rantisi, professor in the geography, planning and environment department at Montreal\u2019s Concordia University.</p> <p>\u201cWhat this Montreal campus represents is a heavily publicly subsidised institution that\u2019s serving the commercialisation of knowledge in ways that are supporting private sector endeavours,\u201d she says, \u201cbut at the same time putting at risk a lot of the lower-income residents and lower-income establishments.\u201d</p> <p> Critics say the university should be paying more attention to its immediate impact on the neighbourhoods where it is located.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7a72a925b42f4574922c69902f0cc1664ac7e7ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a72a925b42f4574922c69902f0cc1664ac7e7ae/0_139_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A coffee shop for self-employed workers, in Mile End, an area that rapidly gentrified with the arrival of games giant Ubisoft.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A coffee shop for self-employed workers, in Mile End, an area that rapidly gentrified with the arrival of games giant Ubisoft.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alice Chiche/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Research has shown that large institutions can<a href=\"https://democracycollaborative.org/higher-ed-anchor-mission\"> leverage their economic power</a> to spur inclusive growth in surrounding communities. The University of Toronto has launched an <a href=\"https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/partnerships/sites/utsc.utoronto.ca.partnerships/files/docs/Community_Partnerships_2017.pdf\">Anchor Strategy</a> for its campus in Scarborough, one of Canada\u2019s most multicultural areas, which includes reforming its procurement process to bring in more diverse and local enterprises on campus, and increasing employment and training opportunities for nearby residents. Drexel University in Philadelphia, US, found that its <a href=\"https://drexel.edu/civicengagement/centers-initiatives/economic-inclusion/step-by-step/hire-local/\">Hire Local</a> initiative led to <a href=\"https://www.cupahr.org/hew/files/Building-Community-Partnerships-for-Local-Hiring.pdf\">decreased turnover rates</a> among staff.</p> <p>By contrast, O\u2019Meara says the University of Montreal hiring process is regulated by collective agreements that prevent it from setting jobs aside for workers from specific parts of the city.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the way campuses used to be built half a century ago,\u201d says Ted Howard of the Democracy Collaborative, which researches the issue. \u201cIf the University of Montreal wants to be a world-class, renown[ed] institution, it can\u2019t simply rely on its teaching and its research, and the intellectual aspect of the institution, as important as that is. It has got to take account of the kind of neighbour it is, and how it uses its economic strength to creatively help solve problems in the community where it\u2019s going to be based.\u201d</p> <p>The University of Montreal says it was careful to plan for negative impacts the Mil campus may have.

      "bodyText": "Parc-Extension in Montreal, Quebec, is one of Canada\u2019s most ethnically diverse neighbourhoods. Of the approximately 30,000 people who live in Parc-Ex, 61% were born outside Canada. The area is one of the country\u2019s poorest: 43% of households live below the poverty line, perhaps a somewhat surprising fact given that it is also part of the Papineau electoral district represented by Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau . Despite being located in the centre of bustling Montreal, Parc-Ex feels isolated and is physically closed off from the rest of the city by borders on all sides. There\u2019s a highway to the north, a large park to the east, train tracks to the south and a fence to the west, built by a posher neighbouring borough. This month, however, Parc-Ex is being plugged back into the heart of the city in a project that some are hailing as transformative but othersfear will gentrify the district beyond recognition, pushing out current residents. The project, dubbed Mil, is a C$348m (\u00a3210m) development by the University of Montreal which will transform a 38 hectare site that was formerly old rail yard into a vast new campus. Mil stands for Montreal Innovation Laboratory, but also plays on the word milieu (middle), a nod to its city centre location. The first stage of the development is now open: a new complex for the university\u2019s science department, which hosts a daily influx of 2,200 students, faculty and staff. The next stage of development will include condominiums, office buildings and public spaces. Beyond the rare opportunity for a city to develop 53 football pitches\u2019 worth of prime real estate, Mil is intended to bolster Montreal\u2019s reputation as a hub for AI research. The new campus will be located close to the university\u2019s AI research centre, Mila, in the nearby industrial Marconi-Alexandra area. The hope is that Parc-Ex will become the next Mile End, a Montreal neighbourhood transformed by the arrival of game giant Ubisoft. The government is investing C$84m into the Mil project, and Trudeau has promoted the plan as a way of boosting Montreal\u2019s intellectual capital as a cornerstone of economic growth. In turn, the university is portraying Mil as a lifeline for Parc-Ex. The development will see the district connected to the well-off, mostly Francophone, borough of Outremont via a pedestrian bridge over the tracks. \u201cWe believe that opening up neighbourhoods and sectors contributes to improving people\u2019s quality of life,\u201d says university spokesperson Genevi\u00e8ve O\u2019Meara. But as the campus opens, Parc-Ex residents are grappling with the consequences of their neighbourhood\u2019s newfound attractiveness. New condo developments are multiplying near the subway station, and homeowners report being pressured into selling their properties by developers. In recent months, the community group Comit\u00e9 d\u2019Action de Parc-Extension (Cape) has documented a spike in evictions and unlawful rent increases. To make matters worse, Montreal is in the midst of a housing crunch, and vacancy rates in Parc-Ex are at an all-time low, leaving displaced residents scrambling to find affordable housing. One resident of Parc-Ex who was evicted earlier this year found herself in a frantic search for new housing for her two sons, one of whom has a disability and attends a special school. \u201cIt was just a horrible, horrible experience being in this mad rush of people just panicking and trying to get a place,\u201d she says. Eventually she found an apartment. It costs C$400 (\u00a3242) more per month than her previous residence, and is roughly half the size. \u201cI just became desperate,\u201d she says of her decision to accept the new, worse reality. \u201cI was so afraid of becoming homeless.\u201d \u2018Parc-Ex was an anomaly\u2019 Until now, Parc-Ex has remained mostly immune to the gentrification forces that have filled Montreal with hip coffee shops, cocktail bars and yoga studios. It is a lively, unassuming neighbourhood, with tree-lined residential streets filled with low-rise apartments, shops catering to multiple ethnic groups, and numerous places of worship. It is also a precarious place. While older generations of immigrants (notably a large Greek population) were able to buy their homes, 78% of today\u2019s residents are renters. Many of the newcomers from south-east Asia, Africa and the Caribbean are those seeking refugee status, undocumented migrants, temporary workers and immigrants of colour \u2013 all groups who face higher barriers to integration. \u201cParc-Ex was sort of an anomaly,\u201d says Rachel Shugart, a Parc-Ex resident and former program director of the Welcome Collective, a nonprofit group that helps refugee claimants through their first few months in Montreal. \u201cThe apartments that are available for the poorest, most vulnerable families are only low-price, despite their central position, despite their walkability, because the buildings are in such bad shape. They\u2019re really terrible apartments, and nobody else would take them if they had any other options.\u201d In 2011, the city\u2019s public health department found that 25.9% of Parc-Ex families with young children were living in housing infested with cockroaches. Bugs, mice, rats, mould and other problems are common, and the city has launched a campaign to send more inspectors after neglectful landlords. But while Montreal had until now avoided the worst of the housing inflation that has seized other large Canadian cities, thanks in part to generous tenant laws that cap rent increases and restrict evictions, times are changing. Property prices are rising, putting additional pressure on Parc-Ex. \u201cThe real estate market has been gaining momentum for a dozen years, but in the past two years, it\u2019s been disproportionate,\u201d says Faiz Abhuani. Abuhani runs Brick by Brick, which raises community bonds to purchase properties and turn them into affordable housing in Parc-Ex. The spike in prices, he says, has dashed his hopes of making deals any time soon. Now, the Mil project is bringing that pressure directly into the heart of Parc-Ex. There are no official statistics on rent increases or evictions, but Cape says it helped close to 500 tenants in the first half of 2019. Of those, 21 were being pushed out illegally and 16 had been pressured to leave. Since last year there has been \u201ca significant increase in the number of people coming to see us for questions relating to rent increases, repossessions, and major renovations,\u201d says Cape\u2019s Amy Darwish. The tension is also being ratcheted up by Montreal\u2019s long-time effort to create jobs and raise the tax base by attracting the tech, creative and knowledge industries. Mile End quickly gentrified after Ubisoft moved in, aided by tax credits. As Mil opens there is also a push to attract AI companies to the Marconi-Alexandra area where the University of Montreal\u2019s Mila research centre is located, as well as companies such as Element AI; in September Microsoft will move into a new research lab a short walk away from Mil. Mil itself represents a \u201cquick fix\u201d for the city to raise revenue, says Norma Rantisi, professor in the geography, planning and environment department at Montreal\u2019s Concordia University. \u201cWhat this Montreal campus represents is a heavily publicly subsidised institution that\u2019s serving the commercialisation of knowledge in ways that are supporting private sector endeavours,\u201d she says, \u201cbut at the same time putting at risk a lot of the lower-income residents and lower-income establishments.\u201d Critics say the university should be paying more attention to its immediate impact on the neighbourhoods where it is located. Research has shown that large institutions can leverage their economic power to spur inclusive growth in surrounding communities. The University of Toronto has launched an Anchor Strategy for its campus in Scarborough, one of Canada\u2019s most multicultural areas, which includes reforming its procurement process to bring in more diverse and local enterprises on campus, and increasing employment and training opportunities for nearby residents. Drexel University in Philadelphia, US, found that its Hire Local initiative led to decreased turnover rates among staff. By contrast, O\u2019Meara says the University of Montreal hiring process is regulated by collective agreements that prevent it from setting jobs aside for workers from specific parts of the city. \u201cThat\u2019s the way campuses used to be built half a century ago,\u201d says Ted Howard of the Democracy Collaborative, which researches the issue. \u201cIf the University of Montreal wants to be a world-class, renown[ed] institution, it can\u2019t simply rely on its teaching and its research, and the intellectual aspect of the institution, as important as that is. It has got to take account of the kind of neighbour it is, and how it uses its economic strength to creatively help solve problems in the community where it\u2019s going to be based.\u201d The University of Montreal says it was careful to plan for negative impacts the Mil campus may have. O\u2019Meara says that of the 1,300 new housing units planned, 15% will match affordability guidelines and another 15% will be social housing. There will be new bike lanes and parks, all made accessible by the new footbridge. The campus is aiming for a LEED for Neighborhood Development (LEED ND) certification, which rates urban projects on the basis of environmental sustainability, and a portion of the new land was made temporarily available to community gardens while construction unfolds. A mobile health clinic was set up for low-income children in Parc-Ex. But none of the housing is reserved for current Parc-Ex residents, and it is unclear when any of it will be built; the roughly 1,000 households in Parc-Ex on a waiting list for social housing will not get first rights on the new Mil units. \u201cThe arrival of the University of Montreal has created havoc,\u201d says one resident who has lived in Parc-Ex for 28 years. \u201cMost people here are immigrants, they earn the minimum wage, some are on welfare. If the University of Montreal brings improvements, they won\u2019t benefit those people. We\u2019ve seen it happen in other neighbourhoods.\u201d Concerns about the project\u2019s ability to integrate seamlessly with surrounding neighbourhoods were voiced early on. The former dean of the architecture school, Jean-Claude Marsan, argued for the university to densify its existing campus rather than build a second one, out of fears the new campus wouldn\u2019t be economically viable. In 2006 Montreal\u2019s other French-speaking university, UQAM, barely escaped bankruptcy when funds for its own new science campus and student housing project were mismanaged.

The first curious thing to note about members of this group is that they define themselves in opposition to an identity that doesn\u2019t actually exist. They are anti-woke, even though there is no \u201cwoke\u201d. Woke \u2013 a term once used by African Americans to denote people who were alert to racism and social injustice \u2013 has been retired. As is often the case with black innovations, overuse by the white mainstream killed off its authenticity. Today, the person using the word is likely to be a rightwing culture warrior angry at a phenomenon that lives mainly in their imagination. Take Douglas Murray, whose new book is almost entirely a rant against what he perceives as a kind of authoritarian \u201cwokeness\u201d. The real cause of conflict and polarisation in political and social discourse today, he argues, is this group (whose existence I think he\u2019s imagined) pursuing its grievances (which he thinks we have imagined). Confusing, I know, but the simple version of his argument is this: the struggle for feminist, gay, trans, and black equality is over; the battles are won.

Tuntiak Katan of the Ecuadorian Shuar people spoke on behalf of the International Indigenous People\u2019s Forum on Climate Change (IIPFCC), a caucus of indigenous rights advocates who, for years, has been working towards more robust participation and inclusion at the UN level in response to the climate crisis \u2013 even more so after the importance of traditional knowledge was mentioned in the 2015 Paris accord. On Monday, Katan shared the stage with the Bangladeshi prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, and the philanthropist Bill Gates in discussing best approaches for adapting to a planet that is heating. \u201cThere\u2019s no time left,\u201d said Katan. \u201cWe must make a pact for life and for our future.\u201d In his two-minute address, Katan outlined three climate action commitments of the IIPFCC as requested by the UN secretary general. Of these steps, the indigenous rights leader who also serves as vice-president of Coordinator of the Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon River Basin (Coica), emphasized most the need for indigenous inclusion. \u201cWe are more than 400 million indigenous peoples in the world and we protect 80% of the world\u2019s biodiversity,\u201d Katan said. The address was seen by some as representation that doesn\u2019t go far enough, but in the larger scope of the indigenous rights struggle, it was also seen as a small but significant step towards being seen and heard. Formal indigenous representation has chronically been absent at UN climate talks even though indigenous peoples have been voicing concerns about a warming planet for decades. \u201cThe Inuit have been bringing forth warnings about global warming to the international community since the first Earth summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992,\u201d said Kuupik Kleist, former prime minister of Greenland, in a statement. But Monday\u2019s summit represented the most visible commitment made by the UN in promoting indigenous inclusion in high-level climate conversations and advanced progress from the historic working group formed at COP24 held in Poland last year. At that gathering, the IIPFCC secured their right for the first time to participate in vital decision-making in how traditional knowledge will be exchanged in adapting to the climate crisis as outlined in paragraph 135 of the Paris agreement. Andrea Carmen, executive director of the International Indian Treaty Council, credits these strides to an increasing number of climate scientists who are turning to traditional knowledge systems as a way to deeper understand the natural world. \u201cMost of the states listening to the scientists are truly scared and are turning to indigenous peoples and saying: \u2018Come and sit at the table and tell us what you\u2019re thinking,\u2019\u201d said Carmen. But with UN recognition of these indigenous \u201cways of knowing\u201d, as Carmen describes them, advocates insist that such acknowledgment must also come with assurances; that certain rights, most distinctly spelled out in the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, are firmly upheld. One provision calls on countries to take effective steps to ensure indigenous knowledge systems are safeguarded so that they can continue to be practiced by the very tribal communities of which they belong. \u201cOur traditional knowledge and the ways that we use it and how we think about it, needs to be respected,\u201d said Carmen, adding that traditional knowledge doesn\u2019t begin and end with the environment but rather the whole relationship indigenous peoples have with the land \u2013 economically, socially and culturally. For all the promising gains, though, it was Kayap\u00f3 tribal leader and 2020 candidate for the Nobel peace prize, Raoni Metuktire of the Brazilian Amazon who perhaps demonstrated best the need for more indigenous inclusion at the UN level. Raoni was denied access to Monday\u2019s climate summit despite explaining to organizers that his own ancestral homelands were still going up in flames \u2013 fires blamed on the multinational development logging plans of Brazil\u2019s president, Jair Bolsonaro. \u201cLet Raoni in! Protect the Amazon!\u201d shouted his supporters as he stood in the main lobby outside of the UN general assembly. Amazon Watch, one of the leading not-for-profit organizations promoting the protection of the ecosystem, said Raoni was not properly credentialed to attend the summit although he was allowed access to the main UN campus.

It is fair to say that over the centuries it has not always been tickety-boo on Lundy. For hundreds of years the island\u2019s strategic position 12 miles off the Devon coast made it a perfect hideout for pirates who would pillage ships heading into English ports. Others that have tried to make a quick buck out of it include the 18th-century north Devon MP Thomas Benson, who was paid to deport convicts to the US \u2013 but instead dropped them off 4,000 miles short on Lundy. More than 100 years later a businessman called Martin Coles Harman bought the island and declared himself king of Lundy.

However, a new chapter in the island\u2019s history began in 1969 when the late Jack Hayward, the former owner of Wolverhampton Wanderers football club, bought Lundy and donated it to the National Trust, who leased it to the Landmark Trust.

Some stay for a few hours, others for a week or more in one of the island\u2019s houses. Lundy has become a magnet for divers, climbers, even campanologists who ring the bells of the surprisingly large Gothic-style St Helen\u2019s church. There is one shop and one pub, the Marisco Tavern, but people find plenty to fill the hours. Sue Waterfield, who runs the shop, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic place to get away from the hustle and bustle of the mainland. The 4G is poor and there\u2019s very little phone signal so you get away from all that.\u201d Even as the number of visitors has climbed steadily, the seabird population has soared, trebling over the last 15 years to more than 21,000. At the turn of this century, there were fewer than 10 pairs of puffins on Lundy. Now there are about 7,000 of the birds. Other important conservation work has included clearing the island of rhododendrons, which has allowed the native Lundy cabbage to flourish. In 2010 the sea around Lundy was designated as the UK\u2019s first marine conservation zone. The waters around the island are alive with grey seals and lobsters. Restoration and repair work has also taken place on the church, road, jetty and the 23 self-catering properties. But there are challenges. The island\u2019s custodians fear the climate emergency could endanger the wildlife \u2013 for example, rising sea levels could result in fewer places for seals to haul themselves out of the water. The island\u2019s green credentials are let down by its power source \u2013 diesel generators \u2013 and plans are afoot to work towards renewable energy, though few are keen on turbines being set up on the cliffs. Work is under way to make sure the island does not run out of fresh water and the ageing ship will need replacing soon. \u201cFifty years ago Lundy was on a knife-edge,\u201d said Derek Green, the Landmark Trust\u2019s manager of Lundy. \u201cIt\u2019s been a fantastic journey and we\u2019re thrilled to be signing the new lease. The island offers a rare experience: large enough to have a life of its own, which visitors can share and enjoy, but small and far away enough to be a world apart.\u201d",

Not just for Donald Trump, but for Democrats as they hurtle toward an impeachment vote in an election year.</p> \n<p>\u201cAs events move, the right will do everything in its power to protect Trump,\u201d Neera Tanden, the president of the left-leaning thinktank the Center for American Progress, wrote shortly after Pelosi\u2019s announcement. \u201cIf you\u2019ve been pushing Dems to fight, I hope you\u2019re prepared for the war that is coming.\u201d</p> \n<p>Progressive groups and activists have been laying the groundwork for this moment for months.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is what the \u2018blue wave\u2019 fought for: accountability for Trump\u2019s crimes,\u201d said Leah Greenberg, the co-executive director of the Indivisible Project. Her organization helped lead a summertime campaign to pressure Democratic lawmakers to back impeachment.</p> \n<p>Now she says activists will make good on their promise to protect vulnerable Democrats who could face a backlash for their decision to support impeachment \u2013 and to pressure Republicans to act, which is the focus of a <a href=\"https://www.impeachnow.org/\">new</a> targeted campaign.</p> \n<p>\u201cHaving to defend a visibly and openly corrupt president who has flagrantly violated his oath of office is going to have an impact on Republicans,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic strategist and former top aide to Hillary Clinton, agreed. Democrats who believe impeachment is futile are \u201cunderestimating the pressure\u201d an impeachment vote places on Republicans, he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to do a Fox News interview defending the president,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very different when you actually have to take an up or down vote on whether to put the president first or to put the country first.\u201d</p> \n<p>Few political observers profess to truly know what the fallout might be.</p> \n<p>But one thing is certain: an impeachment of Trump would push the country into mostly uncharted waters. In modern history, only two presidents have faced impeachment \u2013 Richard Nixon, who resigned before the House voted, and Bill Clinton, who was ultimately acquitted by the Senate.

      "bodyText": "By the time Nancy Pelosi took her place to announce an impeachment investigation into Donald Trump, nearly every Democrat running for president in 2020 and an overwhelming share of her caucus supported the move. Seemingly the tide had turned. After months of beating back calls for impeachment, Pelosi, in a brief but forceful speech, set the stage \u2013 for only the fourth time in American history \u2013 for an inquiry that could reshape the Trump presidency and next year\u2019s election. It is a decision weighted with political risk and uncertainty. Not just for Donald Trump, but for Democrats as they hurtle toward an impeachment vote in an election year. \u201cAs events move, the right will do everything in its power to protect Trump,\u201d Neera Tanden, the president of the left-leaning thinktank the Center for American Progress, wrote shortly after Pelosi\u2019s announcement. \u201cIf you\u2019ve been pushing Dems to fight, I hope you\u2019re prepared for the war that is coming.\u201d Progressive groups and activists have been laying the groundwork for this moment for months. \u201cThis is what the \u2018blue wave\u2019 fought for: accountability for Trump\u2019s crimes,\u201d said Leah Greenberg, the co-executive director of the Indivisible Project. Her organization helped lead a summertime campaign to pressure Democratic lawmakers to back impeachment. Now she says activists will make good on their promise to protect vulnerable Democrats who could face a backlash for their decision to support impeachment \u2013 and to pressure Republicans to act, which is the focus of a new targeted campaign. \u201cHaving to defend a visibly and openly corrupt president who has flagrantly violated his oath of office is going to have an impact on Republicans,\u201d she said. Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic strategist and former top aide to Hillary Clinton, agreed. Democrats who believe impeachment is futile are \u201cunderestimating the pressure\u201d an impeachment vote places on Republicans, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to do a Fox News interview defending the president,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very different when you actually have to take an up or down vote on whether to put the president first or to put the country first.\u201d Few political observers profess to truly know what the fallout might be. But one thing is certain: an impeachment of Trump would push the country into mostly uncharted waters. In modern history, only two presidents have faced impeachment \u2013 Richard Nixon, who resigned before the House voted, and Bill Clinton, who was ultimately acquitted by the Senate. Both presidents were in their second terms at the time. Their impeachment inquiries offer only a crude guide for understanding the political consequences of triggering this constitutional failsafe. For months, Pelosi had said impeachment should be a bipartisan effort with broad public support. But she has now moved ahead without either, gambling that Trump\u2019s latest acts will sway public opinion \u2013 and the legions of Republicans who have been loth to cross him. Trump, faced with the most serious threat to his presidency yet, has sharpened his rallying cry. \u201cPresidential harassment!\u201d he has claimed repeatedly, even as his efforts to pressure the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden, the 2020 Democratic frontrunner, come into sharper focus. A memo of his 25 July call with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy released by the White House on Wednesday showed Trump urged the newly elected Ukrainian leader to investigate unsubstantiated corruption allegations related to Biden and his son Hunter. Trump has denied exerting improper pressure on Zelenskiy and said the release of the call\u2019s contents revealed nothing inappropriate. In many ways the charges echo the allegations Trump faced over his campaign\u2019s contacts with Russia during the 2016 presidential election. \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening,\u201d Trump said during the campaign, asking it to help turn up potential dirt on his political opponent at the time, Hillary Clinton. But the complex narrative of the Trump-Russia saga at the center of a months-long investigation was a complicated story for Democrats to tell. By contrast, Trump offered a simple defense: \u201cNo obstruction. No collusion.\u201d Even after the release of a report by special counsel Robert Mueller outlining multiple instances in which Trump allegedly sought to obstruct justice, a majority of the US public oppose impeachment and his supporters remain as loyal as ever despite his low approval ratings. Trump\u2019s campaign immediately fundraised off the impeachment inquiry, and Republicans are targeting vulnerable members who announced their support for impeachment. \u201cMake no mistake about it: backing impeachment will cost the Democrats their majority in 2020,\u201d Tom Emmer, the chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s closest allies on Capitol Hill have amplified the president\u2019s calls for an investigation into unsubstantiated allegations of corruption against Biden and his younger son, Hunter Biden. Yet Trump\u2019s fixation on Biden may help to underscores a central thesis of the former vice-president\u2019s candidacy: that he is the Democrat best positioned to beat Trump, said Kyle Kondik, the managing editor of Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics. \u201cOne of the upshots of this story is that it makes Trump look like he\u2019s afraid of Biden,\u201d Kondik said. In a statement on Wednesday, Biden called it a \u201ctragedy for this country that our president put personal politics above his sacred oath\u201d. \u201cCongress must pursue the facts and quickly take prompt action to hold Donald Trump accountable,\u201d he said in a statement, stopping short of directly calling for Trump\u2019s impeachment. An unrelenting focus on impeachment in Washington could help solidify the contours of the primary race, as lower-tier candidates, already struggling to break through, find it nearly impossible. That could help candidates like Elizabeth Warren, who is rising in the polls and was one of the earliest candidates to call for Trump\u2019s impeachment. On Wednesday, she called the call transcript a \u201csmoking gun\u201d. \u201cIf this is the version of events the president\u2019s team thinks is most favorable, he is in very deep jeopardy,\u201d she said. Despite the groundswell of support for impeachment \u2013 which now includes a majority of House lawmakers \u2013 many Democrats remain unconvinced that it is the best - or right \u2013 course of action. Some have argued that impeachment would cleave the nation at an especially polarized moment \u2013 and could possibly inflict long-term harm on the office of the presidency. Still, others have questioned the wisdom of impeaching Trump when the Republican-controlled Senate is highly unlikely to convict him. William Galston, a former adviser to Bill Clinton, urged Democrats to reconsider impeachment and pursue instead a formal censure of the president. \u201cImpeachment is a constitutional option, not a constitutional obligation,\u201d he wrote in in the Wall Street Journal. \u201cIt is, in the broadest sense, a political act, and therefore is subject to political tests of feasibility and efficacy. \u201cIf inaction is dishonorable and impeachment futile, censure is the only course that makes both moral and political sense.\u201d But many of the Democratic lawmakers who have come out in favor of impeachment in the recent days argue that Trump\u2019s actions left them no choice \u2013 and said the decision was a matter of principle and duty. \u201cWhen the history books are written about this tumultuous era,\u201d the Democratic congressman John Lewis told his colleagues, \u201cI want them to show that I was among those in the House of Representatives who stood up to lawlessness and tyranny.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Winning tip: Free and easy, Finland Armed only with a towel, a bundle of firewood (in case stocks had run out), a pack of sausages and some spring water (to drink and throw on the stove), I went one evening with my Swedish friends to the tiny, do-it-yourself Sompasauna. Built by volunteers, it\u2019s 15 minutes\u2019 walk from the Kalasatama metro in Sompasaari, Helsinki. Free to use, it\u2019s open day and night all year round and kept spotless. There are no lockers, showers or staff, so it\u2019s real back to nature stuff. After enjoying the sauna, we went for a swim in the Gulf of Finland, then had a convivial barbecue with other visitors. \u2022 sompasauna.fi Clare Georgian splendour, Tbilisi The old town of Tbilisi, capital of Georgia, has a great selection of traditional sulphur baths. Orbeliani is the most popular, and the beautiful facade of tiled mosaic is a landmark. Inside are private rooms that you can book by the hour. These include hot and cold pools, saunas and showers. You can also get a massage. Rooms cost from \u20ac14 an hour, depending on their size and comfort. Julia Barbosa Urban cool, Berlin Close to Potsdamer Platz, Liquidrom-Berlin is a fabulous crown-like space-age structure with various types of sauna (Himalayan, Japanese and Finnish). The floating pool with its underwater ambient music calms the soul immediately as well as helping you to feel really cool. We spent a wintry evening enjoying a break from the hubbub of the city, returning to Potsdamer Platz on the stroke of midnight, refuelled for the night ahead. \u2022 Two hours from \u20ac17.50, liquidrom-berlin.de SplundyBoy Affordable wallowing, Iceland Reykjavik\u2019s Laugardalslaug geothermal bath complex is publicly owned and has none of the glamour of nearby tourist versions, but is a fraction of the price (\u00a36). On a bitterly cold February day, my girlfriend I and took a bus there wearing the snug woollen jumpers we had bought when we arrived in Iceland. We shivered between swimming in the big, warm pools and taking turns on the slide. We lay on our backs in the hot shallows while snow swirled in the wind. Friendly Icelanders chatted and laughed in the hot tubs. She agreed to marry me that day, and that place seems like a strange and lovely dream. \u2022 visitreykjavik.is/laugardalslaug Rhys Davies Glorious mud, Turkey Anyone wanting the full Roman baths experience should take a boat trip up the Dalyan Bogazi river in southern Turkey and visit Sultaniye Kapl\u0131calar\u0131 on the southern shore of this vast tidal inlet. Here you can set free your inner hippo and wallow in one of the warm sulphuric mud pits before visiting the natural thermal spa room and then finally washing off in the open air pool or simply diving into the inlet itself. All that and a view to die for. Bliss. \u2022 Entry 70p, more as part of boat trip Justin Desyllas Making hay, North Yorkshire My daughter and I visited the new Spa at the Alpamare complex in Scarborough. It was a bargain \u00a325 for a twilight session, which also includes entry to the rest of the complex. The staff were really welcoming and gave us a tour of all the facilities. The hay room was something I\u2019d never experienced before but was so relaxing, as you swing gently on suspended recliners amid scented hay from nearby pastures. We also loved the foam room, and the 90C sauna looking out to sea. A great find during our weekend away; we will definitely return. \u2022 alpamare.co.uk/spa Sara Thermal falls, Italy The ancient hot sulphur springs at Cascate del Mulino in Saturnia, southern Tuscany, are the complete antithesis to a fancy modern spa, and all the better for it. The springs are in a stunning, wooded location amid beautiful hills near Grosseto, and, as you enter the water, there is a powerful sense of participating in a ritual that must have changed little since Roman times. Forget about pampering, but go there for a unique, communal experience. They\u2019re free of charge as well. \u2022 visittuscany.com Christine Keogh Brimstone bubbles, France The hotel receptionist in Ax-les-Thermes in the Pyrenees handed us a discount voucher for Les Bains du Couloubret in the centre of town. What a discovery! Turkish meets Roman meets municipal baths in the most understated, relaxed atmosphere. Sulphurous, naturally heated waters take the form of swimming pools, whirlpools, waterfalls and spa baths. With inside and outside sections, the rooftop pool offers views of the mountains. A two-hour session costs \u20ac18.50. The memories remain for a very long time \u2013 as does the faintly sulphurous scent of your bathing attire. \u2022 bains-couloubret.com Josephine Winder Slides and steam, Lithuania Akvapark is a water park and hot spring resort in the spa town of Druskininkai, southern Lithuania.

      "bodyText": "A group of 75 Australian former and current business figures \u2013 including mining engineers and retired geologists \u2013 have signed on to an international declaration targeting the UN and the EU and claiming \u201cthere is no climate emergency\u201d and that \u201cCO2 is plant food\u201d. Several of the signatories to the group \u2013 which described itself as Clintel \u2013 have high-level links to conservative politics, industry and mining. They include Hugh Morgan, a former president of the Business Council of Australia, and Ian Plimer, a director on Gina Rinehart\u2019s Roy Hill Holdings iron ore project. The move was designed to coincide with the UN\u2019s climate action summit and general assembly in New York. Also signing the declaration is Dr Peter Ridd, the former James Cook University scientist who claims that devastating bleaching events on the Great Barrier Reef are not driven by climate change. Ridd was backed by Queensland\u2019s beef and sugar cane industries to deliver a speaking tour in an attempt to undermine the science linking run-off from farms and poor water quality to coral declines. His views have helped force a Coalition-backed Senate inquiry into reef science. The former chief scientist Ian Chubb compared Ridd\u2019s efforts to the misinformation campaigns run by the tobacco industry on the impacts of cigarettes on public health. The Clintel group describes itself as \u201ca new, high-level global network of 500 prominent climate scientists and professionals\u201d but it bears similarities to at least one previous network. In an open letter addressed to the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, and the UN\u2019s chief climate negotiator, Patricia Espinosa Cantellano, the group describes the benefits of cutting greenhouse gas emissions as \u201cimagined\u201d. One \u201cambassador\u201d of the group is a Queensland-based coalmining veteran, Viv Forbes. Another is the well-known British peer Christopher Monckton, who once likened the leading Australian economist and climate adviser Prof Ross Garnaut to a Nazi. The letter repeats well-worn and long-debunked talking points on climate change that are contradicted by scientific institutions and academies around the world, as well as the assessments of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The letter says: \u201cScientists should openly address the uncertainties and exaggerations in their predictions of global warming, while politicians should dispassionately count the real benefits as well as the imagined costs of adaptation to global warming, and the real costs as well as the imagined benefits of mitigation.\u201d The prominent Clintel member Hugh Morgan, a former chief executive of the Western Mining Corporation, was until his resignation in 2017 a founding director and shareholder in the Cormack Foundation \u2013 a $70m funding vehicle for the Liberal party. In 2016 Morgan co-signed a climate science denial statement from a group calling itself \u201cClexit\u201d and formed in the wake of the UK\u2019s Brexit vote. That group, which had many of the same members and organisers as the Clintel group, described human-caused climate change as a \u201cmass delusion\u201d and claimed that adding CO2 to the atmosphere would be good for the planet. The Clexit group said nations \u201cshould not tolerate UN and EU bureaucrats manipulating science in order to justify their dreams to redistribute wealth\u201d. Last week the UK-based thinktank InfluenceMap, which analyses corporate lobbying on climate change, named the Minerals Council of Australia in a global top 10 of \u201copponents of climate policy globally\u201d. This week a report for the UN climate summit reiterated the catastrophic consequences for human society of continued fossil fuel burning.",

Republicans claim it offers him complete vindication. Though not a verbatim transcript, the document shows that, after being congratulated on his victory in the Ukrainian election, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/25/trump-ukraine-president-phone-call-transcript-takeaways\">Zelenskiy thanked the US for its military support</a> and said he was almost ready to buy more American weapons. Trump replied \u201cI would like you to do us a favour, though\u201d and went on discuss possible investigations into Democratic presidential hopeful (and former vice president), Joe Biden. At a media conference with Trump, Zelenskiy said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2019/sep/25/nobody-pushed-me-ukrainian-president-addresses-trump-phone-call-video\">no one \u201cpushed\u201d him</a> over Biden, which Trump immediately clarified as \u201cthere was no pressure\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"4b58d2da-dbb1-4096-bcb6-9bf651d7e853\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/q19IYb35rys?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>As Julian Borger writes, Zelenskiy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/25/trump-zelenskiy-ukraine-meeting-un\">looked like he was going to be sick</a>, in what increasingly looks like a sitcom where Ukraine\u2019s comedian-turned-president is trapped in a Washington whodunnit. In another apparent own goal, the White House <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/25/republican-ukraine-talking-points-email-accident-what-to-say\">accidentally sent its talking points for defending Trump to House Democrats</a>, the substance of which Trump later drew on in a rambling solo press conference in which he dismissed the scandal as \u201ca big hoax\u201d and said he \u201cdidn\u2019t threaten anybody\u201d.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>NHS changes</strong> \u2013 Privatisation of care will be significantly curbed under confidential plans that health service bosses <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/25/nhs-privatisation-to-be-reined-in-under-secret-plan-to-reform-care\">expect Downing Street to include in the Queen\u2019s speech next month</a>. According to NHS documents seen by the Guardian, local bodies in England would no longer have to put out to tender any contract worth at least \u00a3615,278 \u2013 a requirement that has contributed to a big increase in outsourcing of services and a record \u00a39.2bn of the NHS\u2019s budget now being handed to private firms. The proposals also seek to limit the role of competition between different parts of the NHS, which critics claim has proved costly, damaging and a distraction from caring for patients.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Vicious cycle </strong>\u2013 People are being encouraged to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/26/vicious-cycle-delicate-wash-releases-more-plastic-microfibres\">steer away from delicate wash cycles </a>after research found they can release hundreds of thousands more plastic microfibres into the environment than standard wash cycles. Research at Newcastle University found that because delicate cycles use more water they will \u201cbash the clothes around more than if less water is used\u201d. This results in more microplastics ending up in the wastewater, and eventually the ocean and the food chain.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>\u2018Truly toxic\u2019 </strong>\u2013 The head of a group of 600 private schools has hit out at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/sep/26/private-schools-chief-attacks-truly-toxic-portrayal-of-sector\">\u201ctruly toxic portrayal\u201d</a> of the sector, in the wake of Labour<strong> </strong>endorsing a series of measures that would effectively abolish private schools. Christopher King will tell the Independent Association of Prep Schools annual conference today that private schools offer a \u201cpremium product\u201d, without the rote learning and changes inflicted by the previous education secretary Michael Gove on state schools in England, adding that private schools survive because they are better at providing \u201cholistic education\u201d.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Pulp diction </strong>\u2013 Interactions with Amazon\u2019s virtual personal assistant Alexa could soon become considerably more entertaining \u2013 and profane \u2013 after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/26/pulp-diction-samuel-l-jackson-to-voice-amazons-alexa\">actor Samuel L Jackson signed up to lend his voice to the device</a>. The Hollywood star is the first celebrity voice to be rolled out on Alexa, in a feature that will be made available to users later this year, for a fee.

      "bodyText": "Top story: MPs gasp as PM invokes Jo Cox Good morning and welcome to this Thursday briefing with Alison Rourke, in what\u2019s continuing to be a tumultuous week on both sides of the Atlantic. Boris Johnson\u2019s fiery performance in the Commons last night saw the PM go on the offensive, refusing to moderate his strong language after his supreme court defeat, repeating criticisms of the judgment that landed him back at the dispatch box. MPs pleaded with him to stop using phrases like \u201csurrender\u201d, \u201ctraitor\u201d and \u201cbetrayal\u201d, pleas that he dismissed as \u201chumbug\u201d. Johnson later elicited gasps in the Commons when he said that the best way to honour murdered MP Jo Cox was to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d. Jo Swinson, the Liberal Democrats leader, called him a \u201cdisgrace\u201d and the SNP\u2019s Nicola Sturgeon said she felt \u201cdisgust watching Johnson\u201d. Tory Eurosceptics have continued to rally around the PM, but one nation Conservative MPs are privately feeling \u201ca real sense of doom\u201d about Johnson\u2019s tactics, with speculation growing over whether he could be removed and replaced by someone else if he fails to get a deal. Opposition parties have been discussing plans to force the PM to request a Brexit extension earlier than the current 19 October deadline. Jeremy Corbyn told Johnson there would be no election until he was sure the threat of a no-deal Brexit on 31 October was off the table. But the PM\u2019s \u201cpeople versus parliament\u201d bluster continued, with the claims: \u201cpeople outside this house understand what is happening \u2026 The leader of the opposition and his party don\u2019t trust the people.\u201d Martin Kettle writes that Johnson\u2019s plan is to turn his supreme court humiliation \u201cinto rocket fuel at the polls\u201d. If last night\u2019s drama wasn\u2019t enough to fill the front pages, today MPs will be asked to vote on a motion to support shutting down parliament for three days next week to accommodate the Conservative party conference. All of which you can follow on our politics live blog. * * * \u2018Do us a favour\u2019 \u2013 The release of a White House memo detailing Donald Trump\u2019s conversation with Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has taken mud-slinging in Washington to a new level. Democrats say the five-page memo reveals Trump\u2019s devastating betrayal of the country. Republicans claim it offers him complete vindication. Though not a verbatim transcript, the document shows that, after being congratulated on his victory in the Ukrainian election, Zelenskiy thanked the US for its military support and said he was almost ready to buy more American weapons. Trump replied \u201cI would like you to do us a favour, though\u201d and went on discuss possible investigations into Democratic presidential hopeful (and former vice president), Joe Biden. At a media conference with Trump, Zelenskiy said no one \u201cpushed\u201d him over Biden, which Trump immediately clarified as \u201cthere was no pressure\u201d. As Julian Borger writes, Zelenskiy looked like he was going to be sick, in what increasingly looks like a sitcom where Ukraine\u2019s comedian-turned-president is trapped in a Washington whodunnit. In another apparent own goal, the White House accidentally sent its talking points for defending Trump to House Democrats, the substance of which Trump later drew on in a rambling solo press conference in which he dismissed the scandal as \u201ca big hoax\u201d and said he \u201cdidn\u2019t threaten anybody\u201d. * * * NHS changes \u2013 Privatisation of care will be significantly curbed under confidential plans that health service bosses expect Downing Street to include in the Queen\u2019s speech next month. According to NHS documents seen by the Guardian, local bodies in England would no longer have to put out to tender any contract worth at least \u00a3615,278 \u2013 a requirement that has contributed to a big increase in outsourcing of services and a record \u00a39.2bn of the NHS\u2019s budget now being handed to private firms. The proposals also seek to limit the role of competition between different parts of the NHS, which critics claim has proved costly, damaging and a distraction from caring for patients. * * * Vicious cycle \u2013 People are being encouraged to steer away from delicate wash cycles after research found they can release hundreds of thousands more plastic microfibres into the environment than standard wash cycles. Research at Newcastle University found that because delicate cycles use more water they will \u201cbash the clothes around more than if less water is used\u201d. This results in more microplastics ending up in the wastewater, and eventually the ocean and the food chain. * * * \u2018Truly toxic\u2019 \u2013 The head of a group of 600 private schools has hit out at the \u201ctruly toxic portrayal\u201d of the sector, in the wake of Labour endorsing a series of measures that would effectively abolish private schools. Christopher King will tell the Independent Association of Prep Schools annual conference today that private schools offer a \u201cpremium product\u201d, without the rote learning and changes inflicted by the previous education secretary Michael Gove on state schools in England, adding that private schools survive because they are better at providing \u201cholistic education\u201d. * * * Pulp diction \u2013 Interactions with Amazon\u2019s virtual personal assistant Alexa could soon become considerably more entertaining \u2013 and profane \u2013 after actor Samuel L Jackson signed up to lend his voice to the device. The Hollywood star is the first celebrity voice to be rolled out on Alexa, in a feature that will be made available to users later this year, for a fee. The Jackson feature will allow users of Alexa-enabled devices to interact with an AI version of the actor developed using the company\u2019s neural text-to-speech technology. Today in Focus podcast: Can Labour unite and plot a path to power? Sonia Sodha joins Anushka Asthana to discuss Labour\u2019s options now that parliament has resumed and the party has backed Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Brexit strategy. Also today: Tom McCarthy on the moves to impeach Donald Trump. Lunchtime read: \u2018My body feels like it is dying from the drugs that are meant to save me\u2019 To not submit to chemotherapy was to die, writes Anne Boyer, in her moving account of being diagnosed with highly aggressive breast cancer. \u201cSomeone once said that choosing chemotherapy is like choosing to jump off a building when someone is holding a gun to your head. You jump out of fear of death, or at least a fear of the painful and ugly version of death that is cancer, or you jump from a desire to live, even if that life will be for the rest of its duration a painful one,\u201d she writes. In The Undying: A Meditation on Modern Illness, Boyer details the mental, emotional and physical journey that was her battle to survive: \u201cYou must have a desire to live, but it is also necessary to believe that you are a person worth keeping alive.\u201d Sport Eddie Jones\u2019s England not only have to contend with a short turnaround but also tricky opposition in the form of USA when the two nations meet at the Rugby World Cup today. Manchester United squeezed into the Carabao Cup fourth round, 5-3 on penalties, after Daniel James confidently dispatched the decisive kick on a night when Rochdale gave Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s men an almighty scare. Chelsea await United in the next round after Frank Lampard collected his first home win as manager with a 7-1 romp against Grimsby, while Liverpool, whose youngsters saw off MK Dons 2-0, will meet Arsenal. No British athlete has left a world championships with three medals clanking from their neck, but Dina Asher-Smith\u2019s form is so ominous that the bookies give her a better than 50/50 shot of writing a new chapter in track and field history. And William Carson, the grandson of the Derby-winning jockey Willie, faces a six-month ban from the saddle after becoming the fourth jockey this year to return a positive test for a metabolite of cocaine. Business Kristalina Georgieva, the new head of the IMF, says the global economy needs to be ready to cope with a fresh downturn. She comes to office as the world faces threats from faltering growth, the US-China trade war, Brexit and potential oil price shocks. Despite persistent fears about the trade dispute, Asian markets were up overnight on renewed optimism about the talks set to begin next month. The FTSE100 is expected to open flat while the pound is buying $1.237 and \u20ac1.128 after suffering steep falls on Wednesday.

      "body": "<p>The first Donald Trump sculpture I made was out of a chicken. It was July 2016, when he still seemed relatively harmless and I never thought his presidency would come to pass. I\u2019d read the stories of him dodging Vietnam and I thought the chicken was perfect material, especially with its thin skin.</p> <p>Then, a few months later, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women\">Access Hollywood tape</a> came out with him saying he could grab women by the pussy. He was suddenly a lot more disturbing. I wanted to show his true nature. I made this piece out of a dead piglet. I used most of its skin to create the face, then took the snout for his nose. You can see the dimensions of the piece because the piglet\u2019s tail is at the bottom. It has the US food agency stamp that certifies this is American meat. It was important to show that this is not just about one person \u2013 it is an American problem.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It has the US food agency stamp that certifies this is American meat. This is not just about one person \u2013 it is an American problem</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For the eyes, I used bacon, garlic and blueberries. The lips are made from liver and there are lima beans for teeth. I ended up using the piglet\u2019s own tongue for Trump\u2019s. It all came from Chinatown in New York. You can find most things there. I have been criticised for using dead animals. If I worked with plastic, or something else bad for the environment, I wouldn\u2019t be criticised. But critics don\u2019t like the fact that my material was alive at one point. I never want an animal to have been killed just for my work. This piglet was taken to a chef, who took all the meat out and fed it to his staff at the restaurant. My critics miss the point. My work is about the nature of life itself.</p> <p>I work from real photographs. You have to be very precise. Everything is overlaid on a photograph, then I will say: \u201cNo, the blueberry is 0.5mm too far to the left.\u201d It\u2019s painstaking. Some of these pieces, if you include the planning process and building of the sculptures, take over a year to make. With others you have to be quick. <a href=\"http://www.klausenrique.com/pages/Head_Of_A_Woman_No5.html\">My flower pieces</a>, for example \u2013 if you don\u2019t get it right within a day or two, they will wilt.</p> <p>Once I\u2019ve finished, I allow the pieces to decay and photograph them again. Because this was made of meat, it would have smelled bad as it decayed \u2013 it shrank and became really gross, but the photos looked great. I let one fruit sculpture decay for quite a while and one night I came home to my apartment, opened the door, and this cloud took off \u2013 it was thousands of fruit flies. \u201cI don\u2019t care about the art,\u201d I thought. \u201cThis has got to go.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He would probably say it was the worst piece of art he had ever seen, and secretly be loving the fact that the whole world is consumed by him</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>After I finished this one, Trump portraits become an obsession. I made more and more out of different materials \u2013 even mould. It\u2019s my way of processing what is happening in the US. Do I ever think: \u201cWhat the hell am I doing with my life?\u201d You know what \u2013 I do. I used to be an IT consultant, but I stopped in 2007 to become an artist. Every now and then I think: \u201cIt was nice to have a steady paycheck.\u201d But you only live once, and it\u2019s kind of crazy that I get to make a living from turning dead chickens and pigs into sculptures.</p> <p>I think Trump would hate this. But at the same time, he would probably say it was the worst piece of art he had ever seen, and secretly be loving the fact that the whole world is consumed by him. This piece may seem controversial but so far it has not offended any Trump supporters I\u2019m aware of. Most of the ones who\u2019ve seen it have accepted it and said: \u201cOK, you made some art.\u201d The biggest criticism I\u2019ve had is actually from animal-lovers who say that pigs are lovely creatures and should never be compared to a man like Trump. It\u2019s a fair point.</p> <h2>Klaus Enrique\u2019s CV</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"50272015cbfba50b38ec434c8047a3661c0526ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50272015cbfba50b38ec434c8047a3661c0526ee/338_0_2102_3041/691.jpg\" alt=\"Artist and photographer Klaus Enrique\" width=\"691\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Born:</strong> Mexico City, 1975.</p> <p><strong>Training:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.newschool.edu/parsons/college-adult-summer-ny/\">Parsons summer intensive</a> photography course, in New York.</p> <p><strong>Influences:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/gallery/2009/sep/14/food-faces#img-1\">Arcimboldo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/bacon\">Bacon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/pablo-picasso\">Picasso</a>.</p> <p><strong>Low point:</strong> \u201cSpending all my money to put on a show in Miami that turned out to be a scam.\u201d</p> <p><strong>High point:</strong> \u201cTwo weeks later, after completely running out of money, I sold one of my photographs.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Top tip:</strong> \u201cIf you\u2019re scared to do something then just fake courage.

I\u2019d read the stories of him dodging Vietnam and I thought the chicken was perfect material, especially with its thin skin. Then, a few months later, the Access Hollywood tape came out with him saying he could grab women by the pussy. He was suddenly a lot more disturbing. I wanted to show his true nature. I made this piece out of a dead piglet. I used most of its skin to create the face, then took the snout for his nose. You can see the dimensions of the piece because the piglet\u2019s tail is at the bottom. It has the US food agency stamp that certifies this is American meat. It was important to show that this is not just about one person \u2013 it is an American problem. For the eyes, I used bacon, garlic and blueberries. The lips are made from liver and there are lima beans for teeth. I ended up using the piglet\u2019s own tongue for Trump\u2019s. It all came from Chinatown in New York. You can find most things there. I have been criticised for using dead animals. If I worked with plastic, or something else bad for the environment, I wouldn\u2019t be criticised. But critics don\u2019t like the fact that my material was alive at one point. I never want an animal to have been killed just for my work. This piglet was taken to a chef, who took all the meat out and fed it to his staff at the restaurant. My critics miss the point. My work is about the nature of life itself. I work from real photographs. You have to be very precise. Everything is overlaid on a photograph, then I will say: \u201cNo, the blueberry is 0.5mm too far to the left.\u201d It\u2019s painstaking. Some of these pieces, if you include the planning process and building of the sculptures, take over a year to make. With others you have to be quick. My flower pieces, for example \u2013 if you don\u2019t get it right within a day or two, they will wilt. Once I\u2019ve finished, I allow the pieces to decay and photograph them again. Because this was made of meat, it would have smelled bad as it decayed \u2013 it shrank and became really gross, but the photos looked great. I let one fruit sculpture decay for quite a while and one night I came home to my apartment, opened the door, and this cloud took off \u2013 it was thousands of fruit flies. \u201cI don\u2019t care about the art,\u201d I thought. \u201cThis has got to go.\u201d After I finished this one, Trump portraits become an obsession. I made more and more out of different materials \u2013 even mould. It\u2019s my way of processing what is happening in the US. Do I ever think: \u201cWhat the hell am I doing with my life?\u201d You know what \u2013 I do. I used to be an IT consultant, but I stopped in 2007 to become an artist. Every now and then I think: \u201cIt was nice to have a steady paycheck.\u201d But you only live once, and it\u2019s kind of crazy that I get to make a living from turning dead chickens and pigs into sculptures. I think Trump would hate this. But at the same time, he would probably say it was the worst piece of art he had ever seen, and secretly be loving the fact that the whole world is consumed by him. This piece may seem controversial but so far it has not offended any Trump supporters I\u2019m aware of. Most of the ones who\u2019ve seen it have accepted it and said: \u201cOK, you made some art.\u201d The biggest criticism I\u2019ve had is actually from animal-lovers who say that pigs are lovely creatures and should never be compared to a man like Trump. It\u2019s a fair point. Klaus Enrique\u2019s CV Born: Mexico City, 1975. Training: Parsons summer intensive photography course, in New York. Influences: Arcimboldo, Bacon, Picasso. Low point: \u201cSpending all my money to put on a show in Miami that turned out to be a scam.\u201d High point: \u201cTwo weeks later, after completely running out of money, I sold one of my photographs.\u201d Top tip: \u201cIf you\u2019re scared to do something then just fake courage. Fake courage is indistinguishable from whatever \u2018real\u2019 courage might be.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Labour\u2019s conference began as farce, but culminated in a triumphant affirmation of the most radical incarnation of Corbynism yet. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/22/labour-deputy-row-tom-watson-brighton\" title=\"\">abortive attempt to remove</a> the party\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, enraged Jeremy Corbyn so much he broke with his near-cardinal aversion to swearing, and threatened to destabilise Labour\u2019s last major pre-election opportunity to showcase its radical vision. The supreme court\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/24/supreme-court-judgment-sounds-trumpet-failed-prime-minister\" title=\"\">damning ruling against the prime minister</a> reinvigorated morale and offered a necessary reminder of the frightening political stakes at hand, but it was a democratic insurgency at the conference \u2013 although sometimes colliding with old-style machine politics \u2013 that re-energised a Labour grassroots preparing to march into an existential political battle.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Rather than policies cooked up by unelected advisers and thinktank wonks, the wisdom of members would be trusted instead</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The promise of Corbynism was of a member-led, democratised party; and while this commitment has much to recommend it, it has always had limits. For example, the party leadership and major unions have resisted moves towards a key membership demand \u2013 open selection for MPs \u2013 because this would require MPs to automatically stand in a contest with other candidates if they wish to be reselected. As a result, not a single MP has been deselected, leaving the politics of most of the parliamentary party at odds with the membership. Cynical manoeuvres reminiscent of the New Labour era have sometimes been deployed too: for example, the leadership successfully forced free movement off the agenda at the last two conferences, fearing the potential unpopularity of such a commitment. For those who fear the Labour machine can capture even the most radical of leaders, the latter is the most striking example.

      "bodyText": "Labour\u2019s conference began as farce, but culminated in a triumphant affirmation of the most radical incarnation of Corbynism yet. The abortive attempt to remove the party\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, enraged Jeremy Corbyn so much he broke with his near-cardinal aversion to swearing, and threatened to destabilise Labour\u2019s last major pre-election opportunity to showcase its radical vision. The supreme court\u2019s damning ruling against the prime minister reinvigorated morale and offered a necessary reminder of the frightening political stakes at hand, but it was a democratic insurgency at the conference \u2013 although sometimes colliding with old-style machine politics \u2013 that re-energised a Labour grassroots preparing to march into an existential political battle. The promise of Corbynism was of a member-led, democratised party; and while this commitment has much to recommend it, it has always had limits. For example, the party leadership and major unions have resisted moves towards a key membership demand \u2013 open selection for MPs \u2013 because this would require MPs to automatically stand in a contest with other candidates if they wish to be reselected. As a result, not a single MP has been deselected, leaving the politics of most of the parliamentary party at odds with the membership. Cynical manoeuvres reminiscent of the New Labour era have sometimes been deployed too: for example, the leadership successfully forced free movement off the agenda at the last two conferences, fearing the potential unpopularity of such a commitment. For those who fear the Labour machine can capture even the most radical of leaders, the latter is the most striking example. Labour members elected its most pro-migrant leader ever, who celebrated his first leadership triumph by speaking at a refugees\u2019 rights protest \u2013 and yet the party has shown a depressing failure to make the case for freedom of movement since. The tussle over Brexit also exposes the limits of the party\u2019s venerated democratic culture.

The first tumour I ever saw was a darkness on that screen, round with a long craggy finger jutting from it. I took a photo of it from my examination bed with an iPhone. That tumour was my own.</p> <p>To be declared with certainty <em>ill</em> while feeling with certainty <em>fine</em> is to fall on the hardness of language without being given even an hour of soft uncertainty in which to steady oneself with pre-emptive worry. Now you don\u2019t have a solution to a problem, now you have a specific name for a life breaking in two<em>.</em></p> <p>Illness that never bothered to announce itself to the senses radiates in screen life, as light is sound and is information encrypted, unencrypted, circulated, analysed, rated, studied and sold. In the computer servers, our health degrades or improves. Once we were sick in our bodies. Now we are sick in a body of light.</p> <p>Welcome to the detectors with names made of letters: MRI, CT, PET. Earmuffs on, gown on, gown removed, arms up, arms down, breathe in, breathe out, blood drawn, dye injected, wand in, wand on, moving or being moved \u2013 radiology turns a person made of feelings and flesh into a patient made of light and shadows.</p> <p>There are quiet technicians, loud clatters, warmed blankets, cinematic beeps.</p> <p>We are told cancer is an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/aug/10/war-cancer-metaphors-harm-research-shows\" title=\"\">intruder to be fought</a>, or an errant aspect of ourselves, or an overambitious cell type, or an analogy for capitalism, or a natural phenomenon with which to live, or a certain agent of death. We are told it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/feb/24/the-10-minute-test-for-cancer-pioneering-methods-blood-test-detection-tumours-lung-breast-colorectal\" title=\"\">is in our DNA</a>, or we are told it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/30/toxic-america-families-seek-answers-childhood-cancers\" title=\"\">in the world</a>, or we are told it is located in the confused admixture of genes and environment that no one can locate or wants to. We are given only the noisy half of probability that its cause is located inside of ourselves and never the quiet part of probability that cancer\u2019s source pervades our shared world. Our genes are tested: our drinking water isn\u2019t. Our body is scanned, but not our air. We are told it is in the error of our feelings or told it is in the inevitabilities of our flesh. We are told there is a difference between illness and health, between what is acute and what is chronic, between living and dying, too. The news of cancer comes to us on the same sort of screens as the news about elections, in email at the same minute as invitations to LinkedIn. The hash marks of the radiologists are the same as those of the drone pilots. The screen life of cancer is the screen life of all mediated global terror and unreality, too.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The breast surgeon said the greatest risk factor for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/breast-cancer\" title=\"\">breast cancer</a> was having breasts. She wouldn\u2019t give me the initial results of the biopsy if I was alone. My friend Cara worked for an hourly wage and had no time off without losing out on money she needed to live, so she drove out to the suburban medical office on her lunch break in order that I could get my diagnosis. In the US, if you aren\u2019t someone\u2019s child, parent, or spouse, the law allows no one else guaranteed leave from work to take care of you.</p> <p>If you are loved outside the enclosure of family, the law doesn\u2019t care how deeply \u2013 even with all the unofficialised love in the world enfolding you, if you need to be cared for by others, it must be in stolen slivers of time. As Cara and I sat in the skylit beige of the conference room waiting for the surgeon to arrive, Cara gave me the switchblade she carried in her purse so that I could hold on to it under the table. After all of those theatrical prerequisites, what the surgeon said was what we already knew: I had at least one cancerous tumour, 3.8cm, in my left breast. I handed Cara back her knife damp with sweat. She then went back to work.</p> <p>On a scrap of yellow paper, the oncologist \u2013 the one my friends and I later called Dr Baby because of how much he resembled a cherub \u2013 wrote in a childish hand, \u201chormone receptive-positive breast cancer\u201d, explaining that there were targeted treatments for it, then crossed it out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1548c1e0dfffcf7257e98a161d607dd11a1435f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1548c1e0dfffcf7257e98a161d607dd11a1435f5/0_83_2025_2529/801.jpg\" alt=\"A digitally coloured mammogram\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A digitally coloured mammogram.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Hill/Mike Hill / Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then he wrote, \u201cHer2-positive breast cancer\u201d, explaining that there were targeted treatments for it, then crossed it out. Then he wrote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jun/04/doctors-hail-world-first-as-womans-advanced-breast-cancer-is-eradicated\" title=\"\">\u201cTriple Negative\u201d</a>, and explained that there were no targeted treatments for it. Accounting for between 10% and 20% of breast cancers, it has the fewest treatment options and significantly poorer prognoses than others, responsible for a disproportionate number of breast cancer deaths. He said this was the cancer I had. He said the tumour was necrotic, which meant that it was growing so quickly it failed to build infrastructure for itself. He wrote down \u201c85%\u201d for the tumour\u2019s growth rate, and I asked him what that meant. He told me that a <a href=\"https://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/diagnosis/rate_grade\" title=\"\">Ki-67 score</a> of \u201canything over 20%\u201d was highly aggressive.</p> <p>He then said, \u201cneoadjuvant chemotherapy\u201d, which meant \u201cright away\u201d. I didn\u2019t agree to dissect any nodes or biopsy the other potential areas the doctors feared were tumours: this one certain tumour was bad news enough, and its treatment would be so aggressive I felt like there wasn\u2019t any point in a painful intervention to know what else was there.</p> <p>To not submit to chemotherapy was to die, Dr Baby suggested. To submit to it, I thought, was to feel like dying but possibly to live, or to die from secondary effects rather than primary disease, or to live, finally, almost restored, but not quite.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Diagnosis has diminished my ability to tell the difference between good advice and empty ideology. Everything I am advised to do in response to the cancer seems, at first, like a symptom of a world that is sick itself. I read on a discussion board that cutting my hair short will make its eventual loss easier to bear. I try to believe this. I usually cut my own, but this time make an appointment at a salon and sit in the elevated chair, saying nothing, while a blond stranger chops my long dark hair above my shoulders.</p> <p>As my hair falls into a pile to be swept up later by a poorly paid assistant with a broom, I realise then that without ever knowing it I had, at least some years of my life, almost been beautiful and now wouldn\u2019t be any more. I think, too, of how once I always insisted that the best thing about life was that hair grew, which was the simple evidence that nothing stayed the same for ever, and therefore proof of the possibilities that the world could change. Now it wasn\u2019t just that my hair would fall out, it was that my follicles would die, and painfully, that what once grew would stop growing even as I myself kept living, and everything I once understood about the world as evident would be subject to another proof.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>No one knows you have cancer until you tell them. I take a screen capture of John Donne\u2019s first devotion and post it to Facebook: \u201cWe study health and we deliberate upon our meats, and drink, and air, and exercises, and we hew, and we polish every stone that goes to that building; and so our health was long and a regular work: but in a minute a cannon batters all.\u201d</p> <p>It gets a lot of likes. Then I follow the other instructions I find on the internet: tell my mother, tell my daughter, deep clean the kitchen, negotiate with my employer, find someone to watch the cat, go to the thrift store to find clothes that will accommodate my coming chemo port, worry on the phone to my friends that I have no one to take care of me. It is decided without ceremony that the doctors will eventually take my breasts from me and discard them in an incinerator, and because of it, I begin the practice of pretending that my breasts were never there.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In the waiting rooms, the labour of care meets the labour of data. Wives fill out their husbands\u2019 forms. Mothers fill out their children\u2019s. Sick women fill out their own. I am sick and a woman. I write my own name. I am handed at each appointment a printout from the general database that I am told to amend or approve. The databases would be empty without us. The work of abstracting a person into a patient is women\u2019s work \u2013 it only appears, at first, to be the work of machines.</p> <p>Receptionists distribute forms, print the bracelets to be read later by scanners held in the hands of other women. The nursing assistants stand in a doorway from which they never quite emerge. They hold these doors open with their bodies and call out patients\u2019 names. These women are the paraprofessionals in the thresholds, weighing the bodies of patients on digital scales, taking measurements of vital signs in the staging area of a clinic\u2019s open crannies. Then they lead the patient (me) to an examining room and log into the system. They enter the numbers my body generates when offered to machines: how hot or cold I am, the rate at which my heart is beating. Then they ask the question: Rate your pain on a scale of one to 10? I try to answer, but the correct answer is always a numerical. Sensation is the enemy of quantification. There is no machine, yet, to which a nervous system can submit sensation to be transformed into a sufficiently descriptive measurement.</p> <p>The nurses meet me in the examining room after I have replaced my clothes with a gown. They log into the system. Sometimes my blood has been drawn, and I am allowed to look at a printed page of its ingredients. Each week the blood flows with more or less of one kind of cell or substance than it did the week before. These substances go up or down, determine treatment\u2019s future measurement, duration. The nurses ask questions about my experience of my body. They enter the sensations I describe into a computer, clicking on symptoms that have long been given a category and a name and an insurance code.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b47f842e4d7887905ca552b66b78a5a94a4c909\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b47f842e4d7887905ca552b66b78a5a94a4c909/0_249_2815_1689/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Breast cancer cells shown by a coloured scanning electron micrograph.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Breast cancer cells shown by a coloured scanning electron micrograph.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Gschmeissner/Getty Images/Science Photo Library RM</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The word \u201ccare\u201d rarely calls to mind a keyboard. The work, often unwaged or poorly paid, of those who per-form care (or what is sometimes called \u201creproductive labour\u201d \u2013 reproducing oneself and others as living bodies each day, of feeding, cleaning, tending to, and so on) is what many understand to be that which is the least technological, the most affective and intuitive. \u201cCare\u201d is so often understood as a mode of feeling, neighbouring, as it does, love. Care seems as removed from quantification as the cared-for person\u2019s sensations of weakness or pain seem removed from statistics class. I care for you suggests a different mode of abstraction (that of feeling) than the measurement of the cell division rate of a tumour (that of pathological fact). But strange reversals reveal themselves during serious illness. Or rather, what appears to be reversal becomes clarification. Our once solid, unpredictable, sensing, spectacularly messy and animal bodies submit \u2013 imperfectly, but also intensively \u2013 to the abstracting conditions of medicine. Likewise, care becomes vivid and material.</p> <p>During my treatment for cancer, most of these workers \u2013 the receptionists, paraprofessionals and nurses \u2013 have been women. The doctors, who are sometimes women and sometimes men, meet with me at the point of my body\u2019s peak quantification. They log into the system, but they type less or sometimes not at all. As their eyes pass over the screen that displays my body\u2019s updated categories and quantities, I think of John Donne: \u201cThey have seen me and heard me, arraigned me in these fetters and received the evidence, I have cut up mine own anatomy, dissected myself and they are gone to read upon me.\u201d</p> <p>If it is the women who transmute bodies into data, it is the doctors who interpret the data. The other workers have extracted and labelled me. It is the doctors who read me \u2013 or rather, read what my body has become: a patient made of information, produced by the work of women.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In approximately 60 hours, and for the second time, Adriamycin will be infused into my body through a plastic port surgically implanted into my chest and connected to my jugular vein. In order to administer the medicine, the oncology nurse, after checking the prescription with a partner, must dress in an elaborate protective costume and slowly, personally, push the Adriamycin through the port in my chest.</p> <p>The medicine destroys tissue if it escapes the veins: it is sometimes considered too dangerous to everyone and everything else to administer by drip. It is rumoured, if spilled, to melt the linoleum on a clinic floor. For several days after the drug is administered, my body\u2019s fluids will be toxic to other people and corrosive to my body\u2019s own tissues. Adriamycin is sometimes fatal to the heart, and has a lifetime limit, of which, by the end of this treatment, I will have reached half.</p> <p>Treatment with Adriamycin can cause leukaemia, heart failure, organ failure, and will almost certainly cause me infertility and infection. Because, like many chemotherapy drugs, Adriamycin is a generalist in its destructions, it is also toxic to the central nervous system, and my mitochondria will begin to react to it three hours after its administration. This will continue for up to 27 hours, but the damage cascades beyond treatment, is often sustained for years. As I sit in the infusion chair, the white and grey matter of my brain will begin to diminish.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"10c60092e5c796a20f8fd4314317db3593f5b04a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10c60092e5c796a20f8fd4314317db3593f5b04a/0_509_5436_3262/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A nurse administers chemotherapy to a cancer patient\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A nurse administers chemotherapy to a cancer patient.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is no particular way to know how this will change me: the brain damage from chemotherapy is cumulative and unpredictable. Although the drug has been in use for half a century, because it does not cross the blood-brain barrier, doctors sometimes did not believe patients about its cognitive effects, or when they heard these, they sometimes minimised the patients\u2019 complaints as other kinds of cancer-related unhappiness.</p> <p>MRIs of others who have had this chemotherapy for breast cancer suggest damage to the visual cortex, \u201csignificantly reduced activation of the left middle dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex and premotor cortex\u201d, and \u201csignificantly reduced left caudal lateral prefrontal cortex activation, increased perseverative errors, and reduced processing speed\u201d.</p> <p>Patients report that they lose the ability to read, to recall words, to speak fluently, to make decisions, and to remember. Some lose not just their short-term memories, but their episodic ones: that is, they lose memory of their lives.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Chemotherapy, like most medical treatments, is boring. Like death, it is a lot of waiting for your name to be called. It is also waiting while the potential for panic and pain hangs around, too, waiting for its name to be called. In this it is like war.</p> <p>A nurse in a hazmat suit inserts a large needle into my plastic subdermal port. First things are drawn from me, then things are flushed in and out of me, then things drip into me. For each of these things that drip into me, I must say my own name and when I was born.</p> <p>Of the many drugs that I am infused with, some of them are drugs with familiar, clear-cut effects: Benadryl, steroids, Ativan. I should know how these feel, but in this context, they never feel like themselves. Instead, they combine with the chemotherapy drugs into a new feeling, each type of chemotherapy mixing with its additives into a unique mush of hybrid lack of clarity.</p> <p>I try to be the best-dressed person in the infusion room, wrap myself up in thrift-store luxury and pin it together with a large gold brooch in the shape of a horseshoe. The nurses always praise the way I dress. I need that. Then they infuse me with a platinum agent, among other things, and I am a person in thrift-store luxury with platinum running through her veins.</p> <p>After the infusion is over, I sit up until I fall over. I don\u2019t give up until I give up, try to win all the board games, remember all the books any of us have read, go out if I can, try to flirt and gossip and analyse into the night. Terrible things are happening in my body. Sometimes I will say it to my companions: \u201cTerrible things are happening inside of me.\u201d Finally, 40 or 48 or 60 hours later, I can\u2019t move and there is nothing to take for the pain, but trying to be obedient to medicine and polite to my friends, I take something for the pain.</p> <p>Someone once said that choosing chemotherapy is like choosing to jump off a building when someone is holding a gun to your head. You jump out of fear of death, or at least a fear of the painful and ugly version of death that is cancer, or you jump from a desire to live, even if that life will be for the rest of its duration a painful one.</p> <p>There is a choice, of course, and you make it, but the choice never really feels like yours. You comply out of a fear of disappointing others, a fear of being seen as deserving of your suffering, a hope that you could again feel healthy, a fear that you will be blamed for your own dying, a hope that you can put it all behind you, a fear of being named as the person who cannot cheerfully submit to every form of self-preservative self-destruction written in the popular instructions. You comply from ritual obedience, as when the teacher hands out exams, or the bailiff says \u201cAll rise\u201d, or the minister entreats a prayer, or the cops shout \u201cMove along\u201d. You comply from hope that obedience now will result in years in which you can disobey later. You comply because the only other option might be to drink carrot juice and die of your own cellular proliferation, refusing to admit your own mortal vulnerabilities, pinning heartbreaking notes about spontaneous remission around your room.</p> <p>You must have a desire to live, but it is also necessary to believe that you are a person worth keeping alive. Cancer requires painful, expensive, environmentally harmful, extractive medicine. My desire to survive means I still can\u2019t bring myself to unravel survival\u2019s ethics. One of the chemotherapy drugs with which I was treated, cyclophosphamide, passes into the urine only partially diluted, is only partially removed by water treatment methods, and lasts in the common water supply for 400 to 800 days. Another, carboplatin, is described in its manufacturer\u2019s information sheet as having the \u201cenvironmental fate\u201d of accumulating in aquatic environments, where it lingers but no one yet knows what damage it does. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/nov/10/iucn-red-list-tree-chemotherapy\" title=\"\">Himalayan yew tree</a>, from which one of my chemotherapy drugs is harvested, has been endangered since 2011. Cancer spending was $130bn in 2017, greater than the GDP of more than a hundred countries. The cost of one chemotherapy infusion was more money than I had then earned in any year of my life.</p> <p>My problem is that I wanted to live millions of dollars\u2019 worth but could never then or now answer why I deserved the extravagance of this existence, why I consented to allow the marketplace to use as its bounty all of my profitable troubles. How many books, to pay back the world for my still existing, would I have to write?</p> <p>And after treatment, when my body was wrecked, when my body was like a car with parts that kept falling off, when I failed at, as US disability law calls it, \u201cbasic activities of daily living\u201d, I wondered how all those dollars had passed through my body and I was still left in such bad shape. If I calculated the cost of each breath I took after this cancer, I should breathe out stock options. My life was a luxury good, but I was corroded, I was mutilated, I was uncertain. I was not OK.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>After the cancer has you, you forget how much life you have lost to living, and also how much of yourself you have lost to illness because it is difficult to take care of the illness and to take care of yourself as well. To take care of your illness can become the whole reason for existing, a marriage arranged by fate, and later when it isn\u2019t the acute illness stealing life from life it is the chronic disabling conditions left over from curing it, too.</p> <p>My body feels like it is dying as a side-effect of what is promised to keep it alive, and requests, as its preservation, its destruction: to not move, to not eat, to not work, to not sleep, to refuse all touch. Every nerve is a beggar, asking for the alms of an end. Any wisdom of my body comes out as an insufferably melodramatic request made by a fool. I had to believe, however, that all my body meant by wanting to die then was not that it hated life, only that it could no longer bear this.</p> <p>Then my body bore the unbearable, as many of ours do. Sometimes the only way to survive the worst is to run to the perfect refuge of being dulled. Disassociation reigns, but no one minds your daydreaming when you are sick with cancer. Some friends appear to wish that I would disassociate more, that I would give up my love of lucidity through events better survived in mental retreat.</p> <p>Despite icing my hands and feet all during chemotherapy in an attempt to avoid it, my fingernails and toenails begin to lift from their beds. Fingernails lifting from fingers hurt as badly as fingernails lifting from fingers should. I bandage my iridescently painted nails on to me. I\u2019ve lost friends, lovers, memory, eyelashes and money to this illness, so I am stubbornly opposed to losing anything else to which I am attached. My nails fall off despite my opposition to their loss.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9dbee8d5d637ae8b6965ba01bd8c971632fc0e0f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9dbee8d5d637ae8b6965ba01bd8c971632fc0e0f/0_413_3840_4800/800.jpg\" alt=\"A chemotherapy bag\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A chemotherapy bag.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My nerves begin to die, disintegrating into a sizzling sensation from their ends in my fingers, toes and genitals. Then my fingers are the most annoying solipsists: numb to the world, outraged in their interiors. Your Oncology Journey says the solution to this condition, neuropathy, is to ask others to button my shirt, but it doesn\u2019t explain who. I\u2019m made clumsy by altered proprioception, too. I can no longer trust my feet to tell me where I stand.</p> <p>A woman I know tells me that she, as she had once known herself, has never really returned from the cancer she had 30 years ago. Now in her 70s, she says that she goes to work and comes home each day to spend her hours in disassociated blankness, and because she has to work for a living, must go there once more in the morning and pretend that she exists again. Some of us who survive the worst survive it into bare inexistence.</p> <p>The lost parts of our souls are no more replaceable than the lost parts of our bodies, life incrementally lifting from life, just like that. And there we are, mostly dead, but still required to go to work.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In the capitalist medical universe in which all bodies must orbit around profit at all times, even a double mastectomy is considered an outpatient procedure. After my mastectomy, the eviction from the recovery ward came aggressively and early. The nurse woke me up from anaesthesia and attempted to incorrectly fill out all the questions on the exit questionnaire for me while I failed in an attempt to argue with her that I was not OK. I told her that my pain was not managed, that I had not yet actually gone to the bathroom, that I had not yet been given instructions, that I could not stand, let alone leave. Then they made me leave, and I left.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/sep/21/solving-the-genome-puzzle\">Solving the genome puzzle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>You can\u2019t drive yourself home the same day you have had a double mastectomy, of course, whimpering in pain, unable to use your arms, with four drainage bags hanging from your torso, delirious from anaesthesia and barely able to walk. You are not supposed to be alone when you get home, either. But no one really asks how you manage it once you are forced out of the surgical centre \u2013 who, if anyone, you have to care for you, what sacrifices these caregivers might have to make or the support they require. It should be no surprise that single women with breast cancer, even adjusting for age, race and income, die of it at up to twice the rate of the married. The death rate gets higher if you are single and poor.</p> <p>Everyone understands as a matter of fact that unless you are currently entered into this world\u2019s customary romantic partnership, or unless you have lived long enough to raise devoted grown children, or unless you are young enough to still be in the care of your parents, you are, on the occasion of aggressive cancer in the conditions of aggressive profit, rarely considered worth enough to keep alive.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>I have always wanted </strong>I have always wanted to write the most beautiful book against beauty. I\u2019d call it Cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, paclitaxel, docetaxel, carboplatin, steroids, anti-inflammatories, antipsychotic antinausea meds, anti-anxiety anti-nausea meds, anti-nausea meds, antidepressants, sedatives, saline flushes, acid reducers, eyedrops, eardrops, numbing creams, alcohol wipes, blood thinners, antihistamines, antibiotics, antifungals, antibacterials, sleep aids, D3, B12, B6, joints and oils and edibles, hydrocodone, oxycodone, fentanyl, morphine, eyebrow pencils, face creams.</p> <p>Then the surgeon called to tell me that as far as she could tell, the drugs had worked, the cancer is gone. The double mastectomy performed after six months of chemotherapy revealed a \u201cpathologic complete response\u201d, the outcome I\u2019d hoped for, the one that gave me the greatest chance that when I die, it won\u2019t be of this.</p> <p>With that news, I am like a baby being born into the hands of a body made only of the grand debt of love and rage, and if I live another 41 years to avenge what has happened, it still won\u2019t be enough.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/undying-9780241399729.html\">The Undying: A Meditation on Modern Illness</a> by Anne Boyer is published by Allen Lane</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "When the technician leaves the room, I turn my head towards the screen to interpret any neoplasms, the webs of nerves, the small lit fonts in which my pathology or my future might be written. The first tumour I ever saw was a darkness on that screen, round with a long craggy finger jutting from it. I took a photo of it from my examination bed with an iPhone. That tumour was my own. To be declared with certainty ill while feeling with certainty fine is to fall on the hardness of language without being given even an hour of soft uncertainty in which to steady oneself with pre-emptive worry. Now you don\u2019t have a solution to a problem, now you have a specific name for a life breaking in two. Illness that never bothered to announce itself to the senses radiates in screen life, as light is sound and is information encrypted, unencrypted, circulated, analysed, rated, studied and sold. In the computer servers, our health degrades or improves. Once we were sick in our bodies. Now we are sick in a body of light. Welcome to the detectors with names made of letters: MRI, CT, PET. Earmuffs on, gown on, gown removed, arms up, arms down, breathe in, breathe out, blood drawn, dye injected, wand in, wand on, moving or being moved \u2013 radiology turns a person made of feelings and flesh into a patient made of light and shadows. There are quiet technicians, loud clatters, warmed blankets, cinematic beeps. We are told cancer is an intruder to be fought, or an errant aspect of ourselves, or an overambitious cell type, or an analogy for capitalism, or a natural phenomenon with which to live, or a certain agent of death. We are told it is in our DNA, or we are told it is in the world, or we are told it is located in the confused admixture of genes and environment that no one can locate or wants to. We are given only the noisy half of probability that its cause is located inside of ourselves and never the quiet part of probability that cancer\u2019s source pervades our shared world. Our genes are tested: our drinking water isn\u2019t. Our body is scanned, but not our air. We are told it is in the error of our feelings or told it is in the inevitabilities of our flesh. We are told there is a difference between illness and health, between what is acute and what is chronic, between living and dying, too. The news of cancer comes to us on the same sort of screens as the news about elections, in email at the same minute as invitations to LinkedIn. The hash marks of the radiologists are the same as those of the drone pilots. The screen life of cancer is the screen life of all mediated global terror and unreality, too. * * * The breast surgeon said the greatest risk factor for breast cancer was having breasts. She wouldn\u2019t give me the initial results of the biopsy if I was alone. My friend Cara worked for an hourly wage and had no time off without losing out on money she needed to live, so she drove out to the suburban medical office on her lunch break in order that I could get my diagnosis. In the US, if you aren\u2019t someone\u2019s child, parent, or spouse, the law allows no one else guaranteed leave from work to take care of you. If you are loved outside the enclosure of family, the law doesn\u2019t care how deeply \u2013 even with all the unofficialised love in the world enfolding you, if you need to be cared for by others, it must be in stolen slivers of time. As Cara and I sat in the skylit beige of the conference room waiting for the surgeon to arrive, Cara gave me the switchblade she carried in her purse so that I could hold on to it under the table. After all of those theatrical prerequisites, what the surgeon said was what we already knew: I had at least one cancerous tumour, 3.8cm, in my left breast. I handed Cara back her knife damp with sweat. She then went back to work. On a scrap of yellow paper, the oncologist \u2013 the one my friends and I later called Dr Baby because of how much he resembled a cherub \u2013 wrote in a childish hand, \u201chormone receptive-positive breast cancer\u201d, explaining that there were targeted treatments for it, then crossed it out. Then he wrote, \u201cHer2-positive breast cancer\u201d, explaining that there were targeted treatments for it, then crossed it out. Then he wrote \u201cTriple Negative\u201d, and explained that there were no targeted treatments for it. Accounting for between 10% and 20% of breast cancers, it has the fewest treatment options and significantly poorer prognoses than others, responsible for a disproportionate number of breast cancer deaths. He said this was the cancer I had. He said the tumour was necrotic, which meant that it was growing so quickly it failed to build infrastructure for itself. He wrote down \u201c85%\u201d for the tumour\u2019s growth rate, and I asked him what that meant. He told me that a Ki-67 score of \u201canything over 20%\u201d was highly aggressive. He then said, \u201cneoadjuvant chemotherapy\u201d, which meant \u201cright away\u201d. I didn\u2019t agree to dissect any nodes or biopsy the other potential areas the doctors feared were tumours: this one certain tumour was bad news enough, and its treatment would be so aggressive I felt like there wasn\u2019t any point in a painful intervention to know what else was there. To not submit to chemotherapy was to die, Dr Baby suggested. To submit to it, I thought, was to feel like dying but possibly to live, or to die from secondary effects rather than primary disease, or to live, finally, almost restored, but not quite. * * * Diagnosis has diminished my ability to tell the difference between good advice and empty ideology. Everything I am advised to do in response to the cancer seems, at first, like a symptom of a world that is sick itself. I read on a discussion board that cutting my hair short will make its eventual loss easier to bear. I try to believe this. I usually cut my own, but this time make an appointment at a salon and sit in the elevated chair, saying nothing, while a blond stranger chops my long dark hair above my shoulders. As my hair falls into a pile to be swept up later by a poorly paid assistant with a broom, I realise then that without ever knowing it I had, at least some years of my life, almost been beautiful and now wouldn\u2019t be any more. I think, too, of how once I always insisted that the best thing about life was that hair grew, which was the simple evidence that nothing stayed the same for ever, and therefore proof of the possibilities that the world could change. Now it wasn\u2019t just that my hair would fall out, it was that my follicles would die, and painfully, that what once grew would stop growing even as I myself kept living, and everything I once understood about the world as evident would be subject to another proof. * * * No one knows you have cancer until you tell them. I take a screen capture of John Donne\u2019s first devotion and post it to Facebook: \u201cWe study health and we deliberate upon our meats, and drink, and air, and exercises, and we hew, and we polish every stone that goes to that building; and so our health was long and a regular work: but in a minute a cannon batters all.\u201d It gets a lot of likes. Then I follow the other instructions I find on the internet: tell my mother, tell my daughter, deep clean the kitchen, negotiate with my employer, find someone to watch the cat, go to the thrift store to find clothes that will accommodate my coming chemo port, worry on the phone to my friends that I have no one to take care of me. It is decided without ceremony that the doctors will eventually take my breasts from me and discard them in an incinerator, and because of it, I begin the practice of pretending that my breasts were never there. * * * In the waiting rooms, the labour of care meets the labour of data. Wives fill out their husbands\u2019 forms. Mothers fill out their children\u2019s. Sick women fill out their own. I am sick and a woman. I write my own name. I am handed at each appointment a printout from the general database that I am told to amend or approve. The databases would be empty without us. The work of abstracting a person into a patient is women\u2019s work \u2013 it only appears, at first, to be the work of machines. Receptionists distribute forms, print the bracelets to be read later by scanners held in the hands of other women. The nursing assistants stand in a doorway from which they never quite emerge. They hold these doors open with their bodies and call out patients\u2019 names. These women are the paraprofessionals in the thresholds, weighing the bodies of patients on digital scales, taking measurements of vital signs in the staging area of a clinic\u2019s open crannies. Then they lead the patient (me) to an examining room and log into the system. They enter the numbers my body generates when offered to machines: how hot or cold I am, the rate at which my heart is beating. Then they ask the question: Rate your pain on a scale of one to 10? I try to answer, but the correct answer is always a numerical. Sensation is the enemy of quantification. There is no machine, yet, to which a nervous system can submit sensation to be transformed into a sufficiently descriptive measurement. The nurses meet me in the examining room after I have replaced my clothes with a gown. They log into the system. Sometimes my blood has been drawn, and I am allowed to look at a printed page of its ingredients. Each week the blood flows with more or less of one kind of cell or substance than it did the week before. These substances go up or down, determine treatment\u2019s future measurement, duration. The nurses ask questions about my experience of my body. They enter the sensations I describe into a computer, clicking on symptoms that have long been given a category and a name and an insurance code. The word \u201ccare\u201d rarely calls to mind a keyboard. The work, often unwaged or poorly paid, of those who per-form care (or what is sometimes called \u201creproductive labour\u201d \u2013 reproducing oneself and others as living bodies each day, of feeding, cleaning, tending to, and so on) is what many understand to be that which is the least technological, the most affective and intuitive. \u201cCare\u201d is so often understood as a mode of feeling, neighbouring, as it does, love. Care seems as removed from quantification as the cared-for person\u2019s sensations of weakness or pain seem removed from statistics class. I care for you suggests a different mode of abstraction (that of feeling) than the measurement of the cell division rate of a tumour (that of pathological fact). But strange reversals reveal themselves during serious illness. Or rather, what appears to be reversal becomes clarification. Our once solid, unpredictable, sensing, spectacularly messy and animal bodies submit \u2013 imperfectly, but also intensively \u2013 to the abstracting conditions of medicine. Likewise, care becomes vivid and material. During my treatment for cancer, most of these workers \u2013 the receptionists, paraprofessionals and nurses \u2013 have been women. The doctors, who are sometimes women and sometimes men, meet with me at the point of my body\u2019s peak quantification. They log into the system, but they type less or sometimes not at all. As their eyes pass over the screen that displays my body\u2019s updated categories and quantities, I think of John Donne: \u201cThey have seen me and heard me, arraigned me in these fetters and received the evidence, I have cut up mine own anatomy, dissected myself and they are gone to read upon me.\u201d If it is the women who transmute bodies into data, it is the doctors who interpret the data. The other workers have extracted and labelled me. It is the doctors who read me \u2013 or rather, read what my body has become: a patient made of information, produced by the work of women. * * * In approximately 60 hours, and for the second time, Adriamycin will be infused into my body through a plastic port surgically implanted into my chest and connected to my jugular vein. In order to administer the medicine, the oncology nurse, after checking the prescription with a partner, must dress in an elaborate protective costume and slowly, personally, push the Adriamycin through the port in my chest. The medicine destroys tissue if it escapes the veins: it is sometimes considered too dangerous to everyone and everything else to administer by drip. It is rumoured, if spilled, to melt the linoleum on a clinic floor. For several days after the drug is administered, my body\u2019s fluids will be toxic to other people and corrosive to my body\u2019s own tissues. Adriamycin is sometimes fatal to the heart, and has a lifetime limit, of which, by the end of this treatment, I will have reached half. Treatment with Adriamycin can cause leukaemia, heart failure, organ failure, and will almost certainly cause me infertility and infection. Because, like many chemotherapy drugs, Adriamycin is a generalist in its destructions, it is also toxic to the central nervous system, and my mitochondria will begin to react to it three hours after its administration. This will continue for up to 27 hours, but the damage cascades beyond treatment, is often sustained for years. As I sit in the infusion chair, the white and grey matter of my brain will begin to diminish. There is no particular way to know how this will change me: the brain damage from chemotherapy is cumulative and unpredictable. Although the drug has been in use for half a century, because it does not cross the blood-brain barrier, doctors sometimes did not believe patients about its cognitive effects, or when they heard these, they sometimes minimised the patients\u2019 complaints as other kinds of cancer-related unhappiness. MRIs of others who have had this chemotherapy for breast cancer suggest damage to the visual cortex, \u201csignificantly reduced activation of the left middle dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex and premotor cortex\u201d, and \u201csignificantly reduced left caudal lateral prefrontal cortex activation, increased perseverative errors, and reduced processing speed\u201d. Patients report that they lose the ability to read, to recall words, to speak fluently, to make decisions, and to remember. Some lose not just their short-term memories, but their episodic ones: that is, they lose memory of their lives. * * * Chemotherapy, like most medical treatments, is boring. Like death, it is a lot of waiting for your name to be called. It is also waiting while the potential for panic and pain hangs around, too, waiting for its name to be called. In this it is like war. A nurse in a hazmat suit inserts a large needle into my plastic subdermal port. First things are drawn from me, then things are flushed in and out of me, then things drip into me. For each of these things that drip into me, I must say my own name and when I was born. Of the many drugs that I am infused with, some of them are drugs with familiar, clear-cut effects: Benadryl, steroids, Ativan. I should know how these feel, but in this context, they never feel like themselves. Instead, they combine with the chemotherapy drugs into a new feeling, each type of chemotherapy mixing with its additives into a unique mush of hybrid lack of clarity. I try to be the best-dressed person in the infusion room, wrap myself up in thrift-store luxury and pin it together with a large gold brooch in the shape of a horseshoe. The nurses always praise the way I dress. I need that. Then they infuse me with a platinum agent, among other things, and I am a person in thrift-store luxury with platinum running through her veins. After the infusion is over, I sit up until I fall over. I don\u2019t give up until I give up, try to win all the board games, remember all the books any of us have read, go out if I can, try to flirt and gossip and analyse into the night. Terrible things are happening in my body. Sometimes I will say it to my companions: \u201cTerrible things are happening inside of me.\u201d Finally, 40 or 48 or 60 hours later, I can\u2019t move and there is nothing to take for the pain, but trying to be obedient to medicine and polite to my friends, I take something for the pain. Someone once said that choosing chemotherapy is like choosing to jump off a building when someone is holding a gun to your head. You jump out of fear of death, or at least a fear of the painful and ugly version of death that is cancer, or you jump from a desire to live, even if that life will be for the rest of its duration a painful one. There is a choice, of course, and you make it, but the choice never really feels like yours. You comply out of a fear of disappointing others, a fear of being seen as deserving of your suffering, a hope that you could again feel healthy, a fear that you will be blamed for your own dying, a hope that you can put it all behind you, a fear of being named as the person who cannot cheerfully submit to every form of self-preservative self-destruction written in the popular instructions. You comply from ritual obedience, as when the teacher hands out exams, or the bailiff says \u201cAll rise\u201d, or the minister entreats a prayer, or the cops shout \u201cMove along\u201d. You comply from hope that obedience now will result in years in which you can disobey later. You comply because the only other option might be to drink carrot juice and die of your own cellular proliferation, refusing to admit your own mortal vulnerabilities, pinning heartbreaking notes about spontaneous remission around your room. You must have a desire to live, but it is also necessary to believe that you are a person worth keeping alive. Cancer requires painful, expensive, environmentally harmful, extractive medicine. My desire to survive means I still can\u2019t bring myself to unravel survival\u2019s ethics. One of the chemotherapy drugs with which I was treated, cyclophosphamide, passes into the urine only partially diluted, is only partially removed by water treatment methods, and lasts in the common water supply for 400 to 800 days. Another, carboplatin, is described in its manufacturer\u2019s information sheet as having the \u201cenvironmental fate\u201d of accumulating in aquatic environments, where it lingers but no one yet knows what damage it does. The Himalayan yew tree, from which one of my chemotherapy drugs is harvested, has been endangered since 2011. Cancer spending was $130bn in 2017, greater than the GDP of more than a hundred countries. The cost of one chemotherapy infusion was more money than I had then earned in any year of my life. My problem is that I wanted to live millions of dollars\u2019 worth but could never then or now answer why I deserved the extravagance of this existence, why I consented to allow the marketplace to use as its bounty all of my profitable troubles. How many books, to pay back the world for my still existing, would I have to write? And after treatment, when my body was wrecked, when my body was like a car with parts that kept falling off, when I failed at, as US disability law calls it, \u201cbasic activities of daily living\u201d, I wondered how all those dollars had passed through my body and I was still left in such bad shape. If I calculated the cost of each breath I took after this cancer, I should breathe out stock options. My life was a luxury good, but I was corroded, I was mutilated, I was uncertain. I was not OK. * * * After the cancer has you, you forget how much life you have lost to living, and also how much of yourself you have lost to illness because it is difficult to take care of the illness and to take care of yourself as well. To take care of your illness can become the whole reason for existing, a marriage arranged by fate, and later when it isn\u2019t the acute illness stealing life from life it is the chronic disabling conditions left over from curing it, too. My body feels like it is dying as a side-effect of what is promised to keep it alive, and requests, as its preservation, its destruction: to not move, to not eat, to not work, to not sleep, to refuse all touch. Every nerve is a beggar, asking for the alms of an end. Any wisdom of my body comes out as an insufferably melodramatic request made by a fool. I had to believe, however, that all my body meant by wanting to die then was not that it hated life, only that it could no longer bear this. Then my body bore the unbearable, as many of ours do. Sometimes the only way to survive the worst is to run to the perfect refuge of being dulled. Disassociation reigns, but no one minds your daydreaming when you are sick with cancer. Some friends appear to wish that I would disassociate more, that I would give up my love of lucidity through events better survived in mental retreat. Despite icing my hands and feet all during chemotherapy in an attempt to avoid it, my fingernails and toenails begin to lift from their beds. Fingernails lifting from fingers hurt as badly as fingernails lifting from fingers should. I bandage my iridescently painted nails on to me. I\u2019ve lost friends, lovers, memory, eyelashes and money to this illness, so I am stubbornly opposed to losing anything else to which I am attached. My nails fall off despite my opposition to their loss. My nerves begin to die, disintegrating into a sizzling sensation from their ends in my fingers, toes and genitals. Then my fingers are the most annoying solipsists: numb to the world, outraged in their interiors. Your Oncology Journey says the solution to this condition, neuropathy, is to ask others to button my shirt, but it doesn\u2019t explain who. I\u2019m made clumsy by altered proprioception, too. I can no longer trust my feet to tell me where I stand. A woman I know tells me that she, as she had once known herself, has never really returned from the cancer she had 30 years ago. Now in her 70s, she says that she goes to work and comes home each day to spend her hours in disassociated blankness, and because she has to work for a living, must go there once more in the morning and pretend that she exists again. Some of us who survive the worst survive it into bare inexistence. The lost parts of our souls are no more replaceable than the lost parts of our bodies, life incrementally lifting from life, just like that. And there we are, mostly dead, but still required to go to work. * * * In the capitalist medical universe in which all bodies must orbit around profit at all times, even a double mastectomy is considered an outpatient procedure. After my mastectomy, the eviction from the recovery ward came aggressively and early. The nurse woke me up from anaesthesia and attempted to incorrectly fill out all the questions on the exit questionnaire for me while I failed in an attempt to argue with her that I was not OK. I told her that my pain was not managed, that I had not yet actually gone to the bathroom, that I had not yet been given instructions, that I could not stand, let alone leave. Then they made me leave, and I left. You can\u2019t drive yourself home the same day you have had a double mastectomy, of course, whimpering in pain, unable to use your arms, with four drainage bags hanging from your torso, delirious from anaesthesia and barely able to walk. You are not supposed to be alone when you get home, either. But no one really asks how you manage it once you are forced out of the surgical centre \u2013 who, if anyone, you have to care for you, what sacrifices these caregivers might have to make or the support they require. It should be no surprise that single women with breast cancer, even adjusting for age, race and income, die of it at up to twice the rate of the married. The death rate gets higher if you are single and poor. Everyone understands as a matter of fact that unless you are currently entered into this world\u2019s customary romantic partnership, or unless you have lived long enough to raise devoted grown children, or unless you are young enough to still be in the care of your parents, you are, on the occasion of aggressive cancer in the conditions of aggressive profit, rarely considered worth enough to keep alive. * * * I have always wanted I have always wanted to write the most beautiful book against beauty. I\u2019d call it Cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, paclitaxel, docetaxel, carboplatin, steroids, anti-inflammatories, antipsychotic antinausea meds, anti-anxiety anti-nausea meds, anti-nausea meds, antidepressants, sedatives, saline flushes, acid reducers, eyedrops, eardrops, numbing creams, alcohol wipes, blood thinners, antihistamines, antibiotics, antifungals, antibacterials, sleep aids, D3, B12, B6, joints and oils and edibles, hydrocodone, oxycodone, fentanyl, morphine, eyebrow pencils, face creams. Then the surgeon called to tell me that as far as she could tell, the drugs had worked, the cancer is gone. The double mastectomy performed after six months of chemotherapy revealed a \u201cpathologic complete response\u201d, the outcome I\u2019d hoped for, the one that gave me the greatest chance that when I die, it won\u2019t be of this. With that news, I am like a baby being born into the hands of a body made only of the grand debt of love and rage, and if I live another 41 years to avenge what has happened, it still won\u2019t be enough.

We are on the turn: the harvest moon, a big brass lamp, rises through oaks above the Severn Gorge and lights the ghostly breath of mist caught in hazels arching over lanes; bats jink against the blue even-glow of a sky stretched taut as nylon and a hawkmoth purrs against your cheek; out in the stubble fields, before the ploughs return, there is a stillness that smells of sleeping horses. In woods by the priory, tawny owls recite the most beautiful of old forest languages with an excitement not heard during laconic summer nights; leopard slugs the size of severed fingers draw silver roads through cut grass, and earthworms slip backwards under torchlight; a toad, badly injured, walks stiff-legged from an unseen trauma towards some dark place where it can retreat into the jewel inside its head. Put out of harm\u2019s way, it was found later, flattened on the road, paying the harvest debt of John Barleycorn. Mornings are nippy, washing over faces like stream water as mizzle slips from branches into the soil, leaving an ochre residue in the crowns of lime and birch, as if some great thing brushed against them as it passed through last night. Puffballs and ceps have bitten chunks missing like foam-rubber toys found under a hedge. Gossamer tripwires of orb-weaver spiders glint as the sunlight enlivens, animates, shines the surfaces of stone and wood like shoes, magnetises insects to tremble with new powers; they \u2013 the wasps, bees, hoverflies and true flies \u2013 come flying in to rooms of light, chasing intoxications of fruit, nectar, pollen and unmentionable juices, in this the season to feed addictions, obsessions and enchantments. There is a quickening of creativity in the air, a nation of the imagination, something bright as gold, loamy as humus, dark as shadow, free as fungal spores; these colours composed on the wings of a moment poised in a glimpse of being. A comma butterfly settles head down on a crabapple tree. We have turned.",

      "bodyText": "Wildlife carers say they are stunned a koala that was hit by a car and dragged along a New South Wales highway at high speeds escaped with only minor injuries. The ABC reported that the young female koala, named Wazza by her carers, was carried for about 10km on the front grille of a car on the Pacific highway, north of Kempsey, on the NSW mid north coast. She managed to free herself when the car stopped after about 10km, staff at the Port Macquarie koala hospital told the ABC. They were surprised the ordeal had left Wazza with only minor friction burns on the lower part of her legs. \u201c[She] was dragged 10km along the highway, with the back legs down,\u201d Cheyne Flanagan, the hospital\u2019s clinical director said. The speed limit on the highway is 110km/h. When the car stopped Wazza scurried up a tree. The driver called the animal hospital when he realised what had happened. The koala had \u201cpretty bad gravel rash\u201d but her injuries could have been much worse. \u201cI suspect she pulled her hind legs up and that\u2019s what reduced her injuries,\u201d Flanagan told Guardian Australia on Thursday. \u201cShe would have been dragged for 10km ...

Wazza, who is estimated to be three years old, has been recovering since the accident a week and a half ago. When she arrived at hospital she was given a general anaesthetic so staff could tend to her injuries. \u201cShe was pretty freaked out,\u201d Flanagan said. \u201cMost wild animals don\u2019t like it when you touch them at the best of times.\u201d Wazza was \u201cdoing fabulously\u201d and could be released within three weeks. \u201cShe\u2019s outside in the rehabilitation yards, climbing trees \u2013 only small ones,\u201d Flanagan said. \u201cIt won\u2019t be long when she\u2019s healed properly.\u201d Although the hospital deals with drag injuries from time to time, Wazza was the first to enter its care after a 110km/h ordeal: \u201cShe takes the cake.\u201d",

The caution is contained in the PBO\u2019s medium-term fiscal projections, released on Thursday, which also show that while spending restraint and lower debt repayments have improved the state of the budget, there are major risks to the government being able to achieve the surpluses it has forecast over the next decade. According to the PBO\u2019s analysis, the projected surpluses could be at risk over the medium term because they are predicated on above-trend economic growth for much of the period and a return to close-to-trend wages growth by the end of 2022\u201323. \u201cWeaker than-projected economic circumstances, such as lower-than-assumed commodity prices, would deteriorate the budget position,\u201d the PBO says. \u201cOn the other hand, stronger-than-expected economic activity would improve the budget position.\u201d The PBO also estimates that despite the Coalition\u2019s $158bn tax cut package coming into full effect by 2024, the tax take from middle-income earners is projected to continue to grow, largely driven by bracket creep. Individual tax receipts are estimated to grow from $223bn in 2018-19 to $393bn by 2029-30, reflecting annual growth of about 3%. Low- to middle-income earners (those with a taxable income in the range of $20,000 to $58,000) are likely to see their tax rates grow in line with income, compared with those in the top 20% of income earners \u2013 those with a taxable income above $90,000 \u2013 who are expected to see little change to their tax rate. \u201cUntil recently, tax receipts were projected to exceed the government\u2019s tax cap, so the budget position was partly shielded from the risk of adverse economic shocks,\u201d the PBO says. \u201cThat is, there was an inbuilt allowance for unspecified tax cuts that could be adjusted depending on how economic conditions evolved. \u201cThe effect of the government\u2019s personal income tax cuts has been to remove this buffer, so any weakness in tax receipts before 2029\u201330 would directly affect the budget balance.\u201d The argument that it was economically \u201cirresponsible\u201d to pass the Coalition\u2019s tax cuts in the face of global economic uncertainty was one that had been prosecuted by Labor before they opted to support the tax cut package in full in July. On the spending front, the PBO warns that the spending restraint seen over the past few years may be increasingly difficult to maintain over coming years given the length of time over which restraint has been applied, the pressures emerging in some spending areas, and the potential need for fiscal stimulus. Spending on the NDIS is expected to increase 7.2% a year over the next decade, growing from $11bn to $32bn by 2029-30, contributing the most to forecast spending increases. The next largest contributor to growth is defence spending, followed by spending on aged care and Medicare. The biggest decrease in spending over the next decade is public debt interest payments, which are projected to fall by 0.5% of GDP over the period 2018\u201319 to 2029\u201330 due to the projected improvement in the budget balance and a reduction in government debt. In the April budget, the government projected a surplus of $7.1bn in 2019-20, building to a surplus of 0.4% of GDP ($9.2bn) by 2022\u201323.

What is CrowdStrike, and why did Trump bring it up?</p> \n  <p>On Wednesday, the White House released a partial transcript of the call between Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in which he asked the Ukrainian president to look into potential 2020 political opponent Joe Biden and his ties to a company in Ukraine. But <strong>earlier in the call, Trump begins to ramble about CrowdStrike, a US cybersecurity company.</strong><br></p> \n  <p>\u201cI would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it,\u201d Trump said, according to the partial transcript. \u201cI would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike...I guess you have one of your wealthy people\u2026 The server, they say Ukraine has it.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>CrowdStrike is mentioned several times in the Mueller Report, as the company was responsible for examining the hack of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s email servers. The forensic work carried out by CrowdStrike ultimately identified Russia as the culprit for this hack and led to indictments of 12 Russian nationals.<br></p> \n  <p>Though it is not immediately clear what Trump is talking about in the transcript, he appears to be referencing a persistent right-wing conspiracy theory that the CrowdStrike investigation of the 2016 DNC hack was part of a \u201cdeep state\u201d plot to blame Russia for election manipulation.<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Conservatives have sought to portray CrowdStrike, which is based in Silicon Valley, as unreliable and part of a conspiracy against Trump</strong>. CrowdStrike was founded in 2011 and went public in June 2019 after raising $280m in venture capital.<br></p> \n  <p>At the root of this theory is the claim the DNC did not give the FBI \u201cthe server\u201d that was hacked, and somehow that server ended up in Ukraine. In reality, there was not one server but more than 140 servers decommissioned by the DNC following the Russia hack. The subsequent investigation concluded it had sufficient information to determine Russian interference. <br></p> \n  <p>Still, Trump has tweeted a number of times about the alleged \u201cmissing server\u201d since taking office, often mentioning it alongside Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201cmissing emails.\u201d <br></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1018072081676865536\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">....Where is the DNC Server, and why didn\u2019t the FBI take possession of it?

House confirms that <strong>Trump </strong>discussed <strong>Joe Biden</strong>, <strong>Rudy Giuliani</strong> and special counsel <strong>Robert Mueller </strong>in his conversation with the Ukrainian president <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskiy. </strong></li> \n   <li> <strong>Trump allies</strong> in the government and at Fox News echoed his claims that the memo reflected well on him. <br></li> \n   <li>However, democratic lawmakers and a few republicans \u2014 including senator Mitt Romney \u2014 said they were <strong>shocked and troubled</strong> by the memo. </li> \n   <li><strong>Hillary Clinton </strong>expressed support for impeaching Trump. </li> \n   <li>The Intelligence committees received the <strong>whistleblower complaint</strong> and are reviewing it.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s the latest: This morning, the White House released a memo on a July conversation between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskiy during which he pressed the Ukranian leader to consider investigating Joe Biden. Lawmakers also reviewed a whistleblower complaint from an unidentified member of the intelligence community regarding Trump\u2019s communications with Ukraine. Democratic legislators who read the document called it \u201cdeeply disturbing\u201d and \u201cvery credible.\u201d Both Republicans and Democrats have called for the complaint to be made public. In a rambling press conference, Trump insisted that the memo cast him in a good light, and disparaged Democrats looking to impeach him. The US president sat with the Ukrainian leader in an awkward televised press conference. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow with live coverage, as congress grills director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire and more details about the US-Ukraine scandal come to light. NYT: Whistleblower complaint includes concerns over how White House handled records The whistleblower who filed a complaint about Donald Trump\u2019s communications with Ukraine also raised concerns over how the White House handled records of the conversation, the Times reports, drawing from sources familiar with the complaint and a Justice Department memo explaining the rationale for withholding complaint: The intelligence officer who filed a whistle-blower complaint about President Trump\u2019s interactions with the leader of Ukraine raised alarms not only about what the two men said in a phone call, but also about how the White House handled records of the conversation, according to two people briefed on the complaint. The whistle-blower, moreover, identified multiple White House officials as witnesses to potential presidential misconduct who could corroborate the complaint, the people said \u2014 adding that the inspector general for the intelligence community, Michael Atkinson, interviewed witnesses. Mr. Atkinson eventually concluded that there was reason to believe that the president may have illegally solicited a foreign campaign contributions \u2014 and that his potential misconduct created a national security risk, according to a newly disclosed Justice Department memo. Elizabeth Warren tops national poll, gains Johnathan Van Ness endorsement Senator Warren of Massachusetts secured a key endorsement \u2014 from Jonathan Van Ness of Netflix\u2019s Queer Eye. \u201cSenator Warren, go save America,\u201d he exclaimed in a call with the 2020 candidate. And as The Guardian\u2019s Adam Gabbatt reported today: Elizabeth Warren\u2019s surge to the very top of the Democratic primary field is continuing, after the Massachusetts senator topped a national poll for the first time on Wednesday. A survey by Quinnipiac found Warren polling at 27% among Democrats and Democratic leaning voters, with Joe Biden on 25%. Bernie Sanders, previously seen as part of a top three of Democratic presidential candidates, had 16%. With margin of error factored in Warren is essentially tied with Biden, but the poll represents a major boost, coming after a slew of recent surveys in recent days found her leading or tied in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada. The Quinnipiac poll contained bad news for the California senator Kamala Harris, who was at just 3%, and the New Jersey senator Cory Booker, who was the choice of 0% of Democratic leaning voters. South Bend, Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg was at 7%. And there\u2019s a 219th impeachment supporter... Another Democratic representative, Sharice Davids of Kansas, has joined in supporting impeachment for Trump, bringing the total number to 218 \u2014 the exact number needed to pass articles of impeachment if all members of the House voted. Davids, the first openly LGBT, Native American woman elected to congress, beat a republican incumbent in 2018. Explainer: What is CrowdStrike and what does it have to do with Trump? From Thr Guardian\u2019s Kari Paul, in San Francisco: Of the many questions surrounding Donald Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president, there\u2019s one that has people especially puzzled. What is CrowdStrike, and why did Trump bring it up? On Wednesday, the White House released a partial transcript of the call between Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in which he asked the Ukrainian president to look into potential 2020 political opponent Joe Biden and his ties to a company in Ukraine. But earlier in the call, Trump begins to ramble about CrowdStrike, a US cybersecurity company. \u201cI would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it,\u201d Trump said, according to the partial transcript. \u201cI would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike...I guess you have one of your wealthy people\u2026 The server, they say Ukraine has it.\u201d CrowdStrike is mentioned several times in the Mueller Report, as the company was responsible for examining the hack of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s email servers. The forensic work carried out by CrowdStrike ultimately identified Russia as the culprit for this hack and led to indictments of 12 Russian nationals. Though it is not immediately clear what Trump is talking about in the transcript, he appears to be referencing a persistent right-wing conspiracy theory that the CrowdStrike investigation of the 2016 DNC hack was part of a \u201cdeep state\u201d plot to blame Russia for election manipulation. Conservatives have sought to portray CrowdStrike, which is based in Silicon Valley, as unreliable and part of a conspiracy against Trump. CrowdStrike was founded in 2011 and went public in June 2019 after raising $280m in venture capital. At the root of this theory is the claim the DNC did not give the FBI \u201cthe server\u201d that was hacked, and somehow that server ended up in Ukraine. In reality, there was not one server but more than 140 servers decommissioned by the DNC following the Russia hack. The subsequent investigation concluded it had sufficient information to determine Russian interference. Still, Trump has tweeted a number of times about the alleged \u201cmissing server\u201d since taking office, often mentioning it alongside Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201cmissing emails.\u201d People who subscribe to this conspiracy believe CrowdStrike is owned by a Ukrainian national. In 2017, Trump told the Associated Press CrowdStrike is owned by a \u201cvery rich Ukrainian\u201d. Officials at CrowdStrike are reportedly very confused about Trump\u2019s references to the company. \u201cWith regards to our investigation of the DNC hack in 2016, we provided all forensic evidence and analysis to the FBI,\u201d Crowdstrike said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cAs we\u2019ve stated before, we stand by our findings and conclusions that have been fully supported by the US intelligence committee.\u201d Chuck Schumer calls for whistleblower complaint to be declassified The democratic senate minority leader joins a republican member of the House intelligence committee in calling for the complaint to be made public. ABC reports that Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s administration \u201ccame to recognize a precondition to any executive correspondence\u201d between Ukraine and the US: \u201cIt was clear that [President Donald] Trump will only have communications if they will discuss the Biden case,\u201d said Serhiy Leshchenko, an anti-corruption advocate and former member of Ukraine\u2019s Parliament, who now acts as an adviser to Zelenskiy. \u201cThis issue was raised many times. I know that Ukrainian officials understood.\u201d The Trump administration\u2019s alleged insistence that the two leaders discuss a prospective investigation into Biden, one of the president\u2019s political opponents, casts his July 25 conversation with Zelenskiy in a new light. During the call, a rough summary of which was released by the White House Wednesday, Trump repeatedly encouraged Zelenskiy to work with Attorney General William Barr and his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, to probe Biden\u2019s role in the dismissal of the country\u2019s prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, in 2016. Elise Stefanik, a republican member of the House intelligence committee who reviewed the whistleblower complaint said it \u201cshould be immediately declassified and made public for the American people to read.\u201d But the respresentative from New York also noted that she does not support impeachment. Democratic and republican lawmakers are expressing concern after reviewing whistleblower complaint It appears that members of the Senate intelligence committee have reviewed the Trump-Ukraine whistleblower complaint. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer said, \u201cI\u2019m even more worried about what happened than I was when I read the memorandum of the conversation.\u201d Ben Sasse, a republican senator from Nebraska, also noted that there were \u201creally troubling things\u201d in the memo, but added that \u201ceverybody in this process should slow down\u201d while lawmakers deliberate the findings. House minority leader Kevin McCarthy has introduced a resolution to get congress to officially avow that it \u201cdisapproves\u201d speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s impeachment inquiry announcement yesterday. The move drew the ire of McCarthy\u2019s democratic colleagues in Congress, including majority leader Steny Hoyer. Zelenskiy thought only Trump\u2019s side of the call would be released The Ukrainian president said that he believed only Donald Trump\u2019s side of their July call would be released to the public, he told Ukrainian media. According to Reuters, the White House memo on the phone call is \u201c a far-reaching diplomatic disaster\u201d: Zelenskiy\u2019s comments to the Republican Trump, disclosed in the summary, will likely irk U.S. Democrats, risking the bipartisan U.S. support Kiev requires while irritating France and Germany whom Zelenskiy criticized in the same exchange. Locked in a geopolitical standoff with neighboring Russia after Moscow annexed the Crimea region and backed pro-Russian separatists fighting in eastern Ukraine in 2014, Ukraine needs all the international friends it can get. It relies heavily on Washington for aid and diplomatic help, and European countries like France and Germany are trying to help bring about talks aimed at breathing life into a stalled peace process over eastern Ukraine. After reviewing the complaint, Schiff told reporters it provided ample information for the Intelligence Committee to follow up though he didn\u2019t provide any details on its contents. \u201cI found the allegations deeply disturbing. I also found them very credible,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cI want to thank the whistleblower and let the whistleblower know that we are going to do everything we can to protect you.\u201d Reportedly, House chair Nancy Pelosi is also reviewing the complaint. Maanvi Singh, here, taking over from The Guardian\u2019s West Coast office, where we will continue to watch the fallout of Donald Trump\u2019s Ukraine controversy and developments in the democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. Here\u2019s a quick recap of today: Donald Trump just wrapped up a press conference, which was broadcast on most major news networks. In the end, he didn\u2019t address most questions on Ukraine. Instead, the president rambled about his electoral college victory, derided the media, touted his border wall and falsely accused Joe Biden and the democratic party of wrongdoing. Acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, denied the Washington Post\u2019s report that he threatened to resign if the White House tried to prevent him from freely testifying before Congress on the whistleblower complaint tomorrow. A memorandum released by the White House confirms that Trump discussed Joe Biden, Rudy Giuliani and special counsel Robert Mueller in his conversation with the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Trump allies in the government and at Fox News echoed his claims that the memo reflected well on him. However, democratic lawmakers and a few republicans \u2014 including senator Mitt Romney \u2014 said they were shocked and troubled by the memo. Hillary Clinton expressed support for impeaching Trump. The Intelligence committees received the whistleblower complaint and are reviewing it. \u201cI thought we won,\u201d Trump said, adding that he believed the threat of investigation was \u201cdead\u201d after the Mueller report. He also continued to accuse the media of being \u201cfake\u201d and \u201ccorrupt\u201d \u201cI used to be the king of getting good press,\u201d he said, lamenting, \u201call of the trauma that all of these fakers have caused\u201d. He ended the press conference after taking one last question from a Venezuelan media outlet. The next question goes to Fox Business, and the outlet\u2019s reporter asked about ... trade with China. Trump insisted that Chinese officials \u201cwant to make a deal\u201d because \u201ctheir supply chains are going to hell.\u201d US and Chinese negotiators are expected to sit down again next month to restart trade talks, but Trump has shown no sign of backing down on his tariffs. Two of Trump\u2019s cabinet members, secretary of state Mike Pompeo and treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, have now taken the podium. The president said that he would take more questions from reporters once Pompeo and Mnuchin finish speaking. Trump has responded to the first question on the Ukraine controversy by echoing the Republican messaging that the White House memo on his phone call with the country\u2019s president showed no quid pro quo. The president also claimed, with no evidence, that Barack Obama had sought dirt on him from foreign leaders. After rambling for about 20 minutes on his supposed achievements, Trump has started taking questions from reporters. Stay tuned. Trump\u2019s rambling comments have now veered into the effectiveness of a potential wall along the southern border. The wide-ranging nature of his appearance so far is less surprising to those who covered Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, however. Trump appeared baffled that Democrats felt the White House memo on his phone call with the Ukrainian president had substantiated their announcement of a formal impeachment inquiry. \u201cImpeachment for that?\u201d Trump asked. The president also suggested that lawmakers should see all of the \u201cperfect\u201d conversations he and the vice president have had with Ukraine in recent months. Democrats would almost certainly take him up on that offer... Here\u2019s a fact-check from a CNN reporter on Trump\u2019s accusation that congressional Democrats similarly tried to pressure Ukraine to launch investigations: Trump, echoing his press secretary, denied the Washington Post\u2019s report that the acting director of national intelligence threatened to resign if the White House tried to stop him from testifying freely before Congress tomorrow about the whistleblower complaint. The president also cast doubt on the legitimacy of the whistleblower\u2019s information as the initial complaint was simultaneously being reviewed by the congressional intelligence committees. Trump is reiterating his claim that he did not pressure the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden. \u201cNo push, no pressure, no nothing,\u201d Trump said. Volodymyr Zelenskiy made the same claim earlier today during his meeting with Trump in New York. But the White House memo on Trump\u2019s call with Zelenskiy showed that the president asked for \u201ca favor\u201d from Ukraine after the country\u2019s leader mentioned military aid. Trump went on to suggest that Ukraine investigate Biden. Trump is at the podium and regurgitating this two-part tweet demanding \u201ctransparency\u201d on the baseless corruption accusations against Joe Biden. Trump is recounting the meetings he has had this week as part of his UN visit and touting his administration\u2019s foreign-policy achievements. According to a PBS NewsHour reporter, the press conference could go on for a while. Trump has appeared at the podium in New York, where he will certainly receive a number of questions on the Ukraine controversy. Stay tuned. The leaders of the intelligence committees in the House and the Senate have received the whistleblower complaint that kicked off the Ukraine controversy and are now reviewing it. As we await Trump\u2019s appearance at his New York press conference, he just tweeted this enigmatic message demanding \u201ctransparency\u201d on the baseless accusations against Joe Biden. As far as transparency on the whistleblower, does Trump mean that the White House will not try to limit testimony from the whistleblower or the acting director of national intelligence? It\u2019s unclear. A Wall Street Journal reporter noted, in reaction to Zelenskiy\u2019s apparent surprise at the inclusion of his comments in the memo on his phone call with Trump, that the White House repeatedly said it was seeking Ukraine\u2019s permission before releasing the document. Trump is expected to soon appear at a news conference in New York, where he will undoubtedly face numerous questions on the Ukraine call. The whistleblower complaint is also reportedly now being transmitted to the congressional intelligence committees, so details on it will likely leak soon. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, reportedly thought the White House would only release Trump\u2019s side of the conversation in its memo on the pair\u2019s July call. According to the White House memo, Zelenskiy repeatedly flattered Trump, informing the president he even stayed at Trump Tower the last time he visited the United States. After Trump criticized the attorney for the Ukraine call whistleblower for donating to Joe Biden, a CNN anchor pointed out that the president himself previously donated to the former senator. Extinction Rebellion activists blocked off a main stretch in San Francisco\u2019s Financial District during Wednesday\u2019s morning rush hour, calling for banks to divest from fossil fuels. Demonstrators dressed as trees and painted elaborate street murals as others with anti-Trump and anti-Pence signs milled about, listening to speakers and a live band with an accordian. They held up signs reading \u201cEarth Above Profit\u201d as they blockaded the entrances to Wells Fargo and Citibank, their arms linked together in tubes. The action had the feel of a block party as the activists literally blocked traffic -- members of the Sunrise Movement made a roadblock with a fake pipeline and oil rig to keep the city\u2019s iconic cable car from its destination. Organizers set up an empathy tent and a listening tent for passersby to talk about climate anxiety. Extinction Rebellion actions have been taking place around the world as part of the climate strike. In Los Angeles, activists shut down Sunset Boulevard on Monday. An International Rebellion is planned for 7 October. The acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, denied the Washington Post\u2019s report that he threatened to resign if the White House tried to prevent him from freely testifying before Congress tomorrow on the whistleblower complaint. Trump\u2019s campaign manager said that the president\u2019s reelection bid and the Republican National Committee have raised $5 million since Nancy Pelosi\u2019s impeachment announcement yesterday. The Democratic fundraising platform ActBlue attracted $4.6 million in donations yesterday, for comparison. Representative Stephanie Murphy \u2013 a co-chair of the Blue Dog Coalition, a group of moderate Democrats \u2013 said she supported the formal impeachment inquiry announced by Nancy Pelosi yesterday. Hours before Pelosi\u2019s announcement, Murphy, who represents a swing district in Florida, said she supported the creation of a separate select committee to investigate impeachment. But that idea was opposed by some of her Democratic colleagues, including representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who argued that forming a select committee would take up too much time and cause friction with the panels already investigating Trump. Murphy has now apparently come around to the idea of launching an impeachment inquiry with the committees already probing the president\u2019s actions. The White House press secretary pushed back against a Washington Post report that the acting director of national intelligence threatened to resign if he was not allowed to testify freely before Congress tomorrow on the whistleblower complaint. The transmission of the whistleblower complaint to Congress will conflict with Trump\u2019s press conference in New York, and there\u2019s sure to be a lot of news from both. Representative Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House intelligence committee, said the whistleblower complaint that kicked off the Ukraine controversy will be transmitted to the panel in the next hour. The acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, reportedly threatened to resign if the White House attempted to stonewall his planned testimony about the whistleblower complaint before Congress tomorrow. The Washington Post reports: The officials said that Joseph Maguire, who was thrust into the top intelligence post last month, warned the White House that he was not willing to withhold information from Congress, where he is scheduled to testify in open and closed hearings on Thursday. The move was in part designed to force the White House to make an explicit legal decision on whether it was going to assert executive privilege over the whistleblower complaint, which centers on a call that Trump made with the leader of Ukraine in late July. In essence, Maguire was serving notice that he intended to cooperate with lawmakers unless the White House moved forward with a legal case to prevent him from doing so, the officials said. The meeting between Trump and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, seemed ... tense, at best. A Washington Post reporter noted the body language of the two leaders: And a CNN global affairs analyst said the meeting was a \u201cmess\u201d for Zelenskiy: Joe Biden has released a statement on the White House\u2019s memo saying that Trump\u2019s Ukraine call represents \u201can affront to every single American and the founding values of our country.\u201d The Democratic presidential candidate calls on Congress to continue investigating the president\u2019s actions, but the statement involves not a single mention of impeachment. Biden said: \u201cCongress must pursue the facts and quickly take prompt action to hold Donald Trump accountable. \u201cIn the meantime, I will continue to focus my campaign not on how Donald Trump abused his power to come after my family, but on how he has turned his back on America\u2019s families.\u201d Biden said in a on-camera statement yesterday that he supported House Democrats moving forward with impeachment if the White House continued to obstruct their investigation of the Ukraine call. These latest comments don\u2019t seem to be expanding much upon that initial statement. Trump asserted that Nancy Pelosi has \u201clost her way\u201d in the wake of her impeachment announcement. The president said he thought that the House speaker had been \u201ctaken over\u201d by the \u201cradical left.\u201d \u201cNancy Pelosi, as far as I\u2019m concerned, unfortunately, she\u2019s no longer the speaker of the House,\u201d Trump said. Trump is making the bizarre argument that Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails may be located in Ukraine. In his call with the Ukrainian president, according to the White House memo, Trump referenced a missing \u201cserver\u201d that he would like to see investigated. Volodymyr Zelenskiy told reporters that he did not feel pressured by Trump to investigate Joe Biden. \u201cI think you read everything,\u201d the Ukrainian president said, referencing the White House memo on his phone call with Trump. With the assistance of a translator, Zelenskiy added, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be involved [in the] democratic, open elections of USA.\u201d He said his July conversation with Trump was \u201cnormal\u201d and they discussed \u201cmany things.\u201d \u201cNobody pushed me,\u201d the Ukrainian leader said. Trump is deflecting attention away from his own actions while meeting with the Ukrainian president by referencing Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea, which occurred during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency. Zelenskiy emphasized that Ukraine needs \u201csupport\u201d from allies like the United States and European countries. The Ukrainian president thanked those allies for their financial support, while emphasizing that the country could always use more. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, opened his remarks in a meeting with Trump at the UN General Assembly with a joke. \u201cIt\u2019s better to be on TV than on the phone,\u201d Zelenskiy quipped, in reference to the controversial phone call that is at the center of a whistleblower complaint on Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukraine. Trump is sitting down with the Ukrainian president amid the uproar over the pair\u2019s phone call that referenced a potential investigation into Joe Biden. In the White House memo on his conversation with the Ukrainian president, Trump referenced CrowdStrike, the cybersecurity firm that helped uncover a connection between Russia and the 2016 hack of the Democratic National Committee. The reference was a bit baffling to many who read the memo \u2013 including CrowdStrike\u2019s own employees. Vice\u2019s Motherboard reports: In a confusing ramble, Trump told Zelenksy he\u2019d like him to look into \u2018the server,\u2019 and namedropped CrowdStrike, the cybersecurity firm that investigated the hack on the Democratic National Committee in 2016. For what it\u2019s worth, people at CrowdStrike are as confused as we all are. \u2018I got nothing,\u2019 Adam Meyers, the vice president of intelligence at CrowdStrike, told me in an online chat, when asked why Trump may have referred to the company in the call. ... How Trump managed to remember the name \u2018CrowdStrike,\u2019 which is mentioned only four times in the Mueller report, each in footnotes, is anyone\u2019s guess. And honestly, who knows what the fuck Trump is actually trying to say here. It\u2019s unclear why he believes Ukraine has \u2018the server,\u2019 and what server he is even talking about. Presumably, Trump is referring to the DNC server that\u2019s at the center of a conspiracy theory completely made up by Trump\u2019s imagination, though perhaps he\u2019s thinking of Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server. ... According to this conspiracy, the FBI and CrowdStrike failed to seize a DNC server that supposedly holds important information related to the hack. In reality, there\u2019s no missing server, and both CrowdStrike and the US government concluded that Russian government hackers broke into the DNC. GOP operatives bragged that Trump\u2019s reelection campaign and the Republican National Committee raked in about $1m yesterday after Nancy Pelosi\u2019s impeachment announcement. But it appears Democrats were also overwhelmed with donations. The New York Times reports: At least initially, most Democrats were less explicit than Mr Trump in seeking to monetize the impeachment push, with several emailing their lists of supporters to first ask them to sign impeachment petitions, rather than asking directly for donations. But money still flowed: The online ticker for ActBlue, the company that processes most online Democratic donations, showed that Tuesday was one of the bigger fund-raising days in recent months that was not linked to a Democratic debate or a monthly deadline. The site showed $4.6m in donations on Tuesday, after $4.2m on Monday. All the 2020 Democratic presidential campaigns use ActBlue, as do most Democratic House and Senate candidates. Senator Ted Cruz is the latest Republican lawmaker to echo the White House talking point that the Ukraine call memo does not show a direct quid pro quo. The Texas Republican said in a statement: \u201cDespite the wild speculations from the media, career intelligence community staffers, and congressional Democrats, the actual transcript of the call reveals no illegal quid pro quo.\u201d Meanwhile, Trump has sent at least 11 retweets in the last 20 minutes to amplify messaging from his allies that his conversation with the Ukrainian president was above board. Representative Liz Cheney, the chair of the House GOP conference, accused her Democratic colleagues of launching an impeachment inquiry with \u201cabsolutely no justification.\u201d Cheney said at a news conference earlier today: \u201cWe\u2019re now in a situation where not only have they hurt national security, but they\u2019re fundamentally abdicating their constitutional responsibility. \u201cImpeachment is a very solemn, grave responsibility we all have and for this Speaker to be going down this path, and for the Democratic caucus to be going down this path before they have seen any evidence at all is something that I think is absolutely unprecedented in our history.\u201d Of course, Democrats might say that the reason they had not seen any evidence regarding the Ukraine call was because the White House had obstructed their efforts to obtain evidence at every turn \u2013 hence the impeachment inquiry. Speaking alongside the Japanese prime minister in New York, Trump made the argument that Nancy Pelosi was pursuing a \u201cmanufactured crisis\u201d with the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. The president said Democratic lawmakers would be unable to pursue any other policy proposals if they focused on impeachment. \u201cI don\u2019t think they can do any deals,\u201d Trump said. But according to one Senate Democrat, negotiations on potential gun legislation remain ongoing, even after Pelosi\u2019s impeachment announcement. Senator Bob Casey, a Democrat of Pennsylvania, issued a statement in support of Trump\u2019s impeachment in the wake of the White House releasing its memo on the Ukraine call. Casey said: \u201cThe recent revelation that President Trump pressured a foreign government to investigate his political opponents is a textbook case of abuse of power which demands action. In order to hold President Trump fully accountable, I support a formal impeachment inquiry in the House of Representatives.\u201d Casey won his third Senate term last year, beating his Republican opponent in the swing state of Pennsylvania by about 13 points. But the statement from a Democratic senator hailing from a state Trump narrowly carried in 2016 is still notable. The Democratic chairs of four House committees investigating Trump have released a statement calling the Ukraine call an \u201cunambiguous, damning, and shocking abuse of the Office of the Presidency for personal political gain.\u201d The statement is attributed to Adam Schiff of the intelligence committee, Jerry Nadler of the judiciary committee, Elijah Cummings of the oversight committee and Eliot Engel of the foreign affairs committee. The chairs said: \u201cThe record of the call released by the White House confirms our worst fears: that the President abused his office by directly and repeatedly asking a foreign country to investigate his political rival and open investigations meant to help the President politically. ... \u201cLet\u2019s be clear: no quid pro quo is required to betray our country. Trump asked a foreign government to interfere in our elections\u2014that is betrayal enough.\u201d Nancy Pelosi is reportedly huddling with fellow senior House Democrats to determine a path forward on the impeachment inquiry after the House speaker\u2019s bombshell announcement yesterday. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: The White House released a memo on Trump\u2019s call with the leader of Ukraine showing that the president did push him to investigate Joe Biden and his son. Democratic lawmakers expressed shock over the memo\u2019s contents, while emphasizing that it demonstrated the need to receive the original whistleblower complaint. (The White House memo, after all, is not a verbatim transcript of the conversation between Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskiy.) But congressional Republicans are arguing the memo shows no direct quid pro quo between Trump and the Ukrainian president \u2013 insisting that Democrats are raising concerns about a \u201cnothing call,\u201d as Trump called it. The blog is still covering fallout over the memo\u2019s release, so stay tuned. The White House just offered a reminder to always double-check the recipients before hitting \u201csend\u201d on that office email. The White House appeared to accidentally send its talking points on the Ukraine call to House Democrats. The talking points encouraged the president\u2019s allies to argue that there was no direct quid pro quo conveyed in the memo and that the whistleblower complaint was handled \u201cby the book.\u201d After realizing the error, the White House tried to recall the email to House Democrats. At the risk of stating the obvious: it seems a bit late for that. Trump quoted a CNN reporter to amplify his argument that the White House memo on the Ukraine call falls short of a quid pro quo. But a CNN anchor noted the reporter went on to make the argument that Trump appeared to be alluding to US aid in his conversation with the Ukrainian president before suggesting investigations. In the tug of war between Trump insisting his conversation with the Ukrainian president was a \u201cnothing call\u201d and Democrats arguing it represents an abuse of power, Volodymyr Zelenskiy is trapped in the middle. Andrew Roth reports from Kyiv on the Ukrainian president\u2019s conundrum: Zelenskiy is squeezed between a US president urging him to dig up dirt on his political rival Joe Biden and a Democratic party that sees the White House\u2019s pressure on him as a compelling argument to unseat Trump. Ukraine, which counts on US political support and military aid to help repel its larger neighbour Russia, could end up being treated like a political football in the upcoming impeachment battle and the 2020 elections, even as it grapples with larger issues of security and reforms. \u2018I am afraid that Ukraine could become as toxic as Russia was during the Mueller investigation,\u2019 said Alyona Getmanchuk, director of the Kyiv-based New Europe Center. \u2018We understand that every move that Trump does in Ukraine will be seen through this scandal. Every \u2018no\u2019 to Ukraine will be seen as an act of revenge. Every \u2018yes\u2019 is a sign that he wants to prove people wrong.\u2019 Representative Adam Schiff has concluded his news conference, in which he expressed shock about the contents of the White House memo and hope that the whistleblower would soon testify before the House intelligence committee. Meanwhile, over in the other chamber of Congress, some Republican senators are complaining about the White House\u2019s decision to release the memo. One Senate Republican called the move a \u201chuge mistake,\u201d according to the Washington Post. The Post reports: A top Senate GOP aide said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is expecting Wednesday\u2019s closed-door lunch to be eventful and possibly tense as Republicans react to the transcript and debate their next step. ... Three Senate GOP aides said Wednesday that their bosses were grousing and frustrated by the White House\u2019s decision and the sense that Republican lawmakers were being forced into the difficult position of defending Trump while contending with what many see as an alarming or at least problematic transcript. Of course, some of the president\u2019s closest allies, including senator Lindsey Graham, are echoing Trump\u2019s claim that the memo represents a \u201cnothing call.\u201d Adam Schiff said the whistleblower who first raised concerns about Trump\u2019s communications with Ukraine is \u201ceager\u201d to speak to the House intelligence committee. The California Democrat added that he hoped the whistleblower would be able to speak to his panel as soon as tomorrow. The whistleblower is reportedly conferring with the acting director of national intelligence to determine how to testify before Congress. Adam Schiff dismissed Republicans\u2019 argument that the White House memo reflects no direct quid pro quo in the conversation between Trump and the Ukrainian president. The House intelligence committee chairman noted that the Ukrainian president mentioned his country\u2019s need for military assistance before Trump asked for \u201ca favor\u201d from the foreign leader. Schiff added that a direct quid pro quo is not the bar for impeachable offenses. \u201cThere is no quid pro quo necessary to betray your country or your oath of office,\u201d Schiff said. But he added that he thought one could read the conversation, as conveyed by the White House memo, as a quid pro quo. Adam Schiff once again compared Trump\u2019s communications with Ukraine, as reported in the White House memo, to the actions of a mobster. The House intelligence committee chairman said Trump\u2019s conversation with the Ukrainian president represented a \u201cclassic, mafia-like shakedown of a foreign leader.\u201d \u201cThis is how a mafia boss talks,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s clear that the Ukraine president understands exactly what is expected of him.\u201d Representative Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House intelligence committee, is speaking at a news conference now. The California Democrat said he was \u201cshocked\u201d by the contents of the White House memo and the idea that Trump officials thought it would reflect well upon the president. Schiff said: \u201cThe notes of the call reflect a conversation far more damning than I or many others had imagined.\u201d Democratic presidential candidates reacted to the release of the White House memo with censure and demands for more transparency from the Trump administration. Many of the reactions to the memo have centered around astonishment that the White House chose to release it, apparently believing that it would reflect well upon the president. From a Republican strategist and outspoken Trump critic: From a former senior adviser to senator Ted Cruz: From an MSNBC host: From a former FBI special agent: From a University of Alabama law professor: Some of Trump\u2019s closest congressional allies were invited to the White House this morning to review the memo before it was released and discuss it, according to a Washington Post reporter. It is perhaps unsurprising then that lawmakers close to Trump have quickly coalesced around messaging that the memo does not incriminate the president and shows no direct quid pro quo. Representative Jerry Nadler, the Democratic chairman of the House judiciary committee, called on attorney general William Barr to recuse himself from matters dealing with Trump\u2019s Ukraine call after the White House memo was released. The memo showed that Trump repeatedly suggested that the Ukrainian president work with Barr and Rudy Giuliani to launch investigations in his country. Trump went on to specifically reference a possible investigation of Joe Biden and his son. The Justice Department put out a statement asserting that Barr did not discuss any potential investigation of Biden with Trump, but that is unlikely to reassure Nadler and other Democratic members of his committee. Republican Senator Mitt Romney, speaking at the Atlantic magazine festival in Washington, said of the memo released by the White House: \u201cMy reaction was the same as I had a few days ago, which is this remains deeply troubling and we\u2019ll see where it leads. But my first reaction is it\u2019s troubling.\u201d Asked if it shows a quid pro quo, the former presidential nominee added: \u201cI don\u2019t know I focused so much on the quid pro quo element as perhaps some do. I just focus on, if the president of the United States asks the leader of a foreign country to carry out an investigation of a political nature, that\u2019s troubling.\u201d Romney said it was important for more information to be made public. \u201cThe consequences are being considered by the House and I\u2019m not going to give advice to Speaker Pelosi... We\u2019ll see where that leads.\u201d Questioned over whether this could rise to an impeachable offence, Romney appeared hesitant. \u201cI\u2019m going to leave it at what I said and let the process gather the facts that ultimately will come out.\u201d Trump and his allies appear to be coalescing around an argument that the memo released by the White House shows no direct \u201cquid pro quo\u201d in the president\u2019s conversation with the leader of Ukraine. Trump himself trumpeted this argument in a tweet quoting Fox News host Bret Baier. (As always, take Trump\u2019s tweeted quotes with a grain of salt. They have previously proven far from accurate.) It\u2019s true that the memo, which is not a verbatim readout of the conversation, does not include a line demanding an investigation of Joe Biden in exchange for releasing military aid to Ukraine. But that doesn\u2019t mean the conversation conveyed in the memo is totally above board. On the contrary, Zelenskiy brings up military aid and Trump is quoted as responding, \u201cI would like you to do us a favor though.\u201d He goes on to discuss possibly investigations and later brings up Joe Biden and his son. So the fact that there is no \u201cwe must have this for that\u201d line doesn\u2019t mean the president is exonerated. Representative Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, compared Trump\u2019s comments to the Ukrainian president to \u201ca classic mob shakedown.\u201d Some of Trump\u2019s congressional allies are rushing to claim that the White House memo proves Democrats\u2019 fears about the Ukraine call were baseless \u2013 a claim directly contradicted by the memo itself. From the top Republican on the House judiciary committee: From the chairman of the House freedom caucus: It is true that the Ukrainian president was the first to bring up Rudy Giuliani, according to the memo the White House released. But Trump then pushed Zelenskiy to talk to Giuliani and specifically referenced a possible investigation of Joe Biden, which the Ukrainian president had not mentioned at all. At least one Republican lawmaker is openly voicing his discomfort with the memo\u2019s contents. Senator Mitt Romney, who previously voiced concern about the Ukraine allegations, said he found the transcript \u201cdeeply troubling.\u201d Speaking to reporters in New York, Trump insisted the White House memo proved his conversation with the Ukrainian president was a \u201cnothing call\u201d \u2013 an argument directly contradicted by the contents of the document. \u201cThe way you had that built up, that call, it was going to be the call from hell,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt turned out to be a nothing call, other than a lot of people said I never knew you could so nice.\u201d But the White House memo, which again is not a verbatim transcript of the call, clearly shows that Trump brought up a possible investigation of Joe Biden in a discussion about providing military aid to Ukraine. Close readers of the memo put out by the White House note that Trump appears to ask for \u201ca favor\u201d from the Ukrainian president immediately after the subject of military aid is raised. That raises the possibility that Trump was posing a possible investigation of Joe Biden as a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d for the funding. It\u2019s important to remember that the document the White House released does not represent a verbatim readout of the conversation between Trump and the Ukrainian president. In fact, the document includes repeated ellipses at points where the conversation appeared to turn to an investigation of Joe Biden. Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren said the memo of Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president is, in and of itself, a \u201csmoking gun.\u201d It is likely that many Democrats will soon echo the argument that the document proves the need for lawmakers to see the full whistleblower complaint. Speaking in New York, Trump appeared to stick to his argument that the memorandum of the Ukraine call reflected very well upon him. On how people were reacting to the memo, Trump said, \u201cA lot of people said, \u2018I never knew you could be so nice.\u2019\u201d He blamed coverage of the memo, which clearly shows that Trump brought up an investigation of Joe Biden with the Ukrainian president in a conversation about military aid to the country, on \u201ccorrupt\u201d journalists. It seems likely that the memo released by the White House does not include all of the conversation that took place between Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Even before the memo was released, journalists and national security experts warned that the document released would not be a verbatim readout of the conversation. But that fact really sparks the question: if this is the positive spin on the conversation, what incriminating information is in the whistleblower complaint? The criminal division of the Justice Department declined to open an investigation into Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine after a whistleblower raised concerns about his communications, according to the New York Times. The Times reports: After a whistle-blower raised concerns about Mr. Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine, the director of national intelligence and the inspector general for the intelligence community each referred the complaint for a possible criminal investigation into the president\u2019s actions, according to a Justice Department official. The department\u2019s criminal division reviewed the matters and concluded that there was no basis for a criminal investigation into Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior. Law enforcement officials determined that the transcript of the call did not show that Mr. Trump had violated campaign finance laws by soliciting from a foreign national a contribution, donation or thing of value. The Justice Department has released a statement asserting that the attorney general, William Barr, has not spoken with Trump about urging Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden. According to the memorandum of his call with the Ukrainian president, Trump repeatedly encouraged Volodymyr Zelenskiy to work with Barr and Rudy Giuliani on an investigation. Republican lawmakers are surprised that the White House chose to release this memorandum of the Ukraine call, particularly after Trump insisted it would exonerate him. The president even said this morning that Democrats would \u201capologize\u201d after seeing it. A HuffPost reporter mocked Trump\u2019s repeated assertions that the memorandum would clear him of any wrongdoing in his communications with Ukraine. Trump repeatedly mentioned his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, in his phone call with the Ukrainian president and encouraged Zelenskiy to work with him in an investigation. \u201cMr. Giuliani is a highly respected man. He was the mayor bf New York City, a great mayor, and I would like him to call you,\u201d Trump said, according to the memorandum. \u201cI will ask him to call you along with the Attorney General. Rudy very much knows what\u2019s happening and he is a very capable guy. If you could speak to him that would be great.\u201d Trump repeated his suggestion for Zelensky to talk to Giuliani before concluding the call. \u201cI will tell Rudy and Attorney General Barr to call,\u201d Trump said. Hillary Clinton announced in the wake of the memorandum\u2019s release that she supported impeaching Trump. Trump specifically asked the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to launch an investigation, invoking special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s testimony a day before the call took place. \u201cI would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it. As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it\u2019s very important that you do it if that\u2019s possible.\u201d The reference to Crowdstrike is unclear, although a cybersecurity firm by that name conducted an analysis of the Democratic National Committee hack in 2016 and determined that two groups connected to the Russian government were behind the attack. A newly released memorandum from the White House shows Trump discussed Joe Biden, Rudy Giuliani and special counsel Robert Mueller in his conversation with the Ukrainian president. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it ... It sounds horrible to me,\u201d Trump said. The blog briefly interrupts impeachment coverage to provide a critical update on another important matter: whether Trump\u2019s commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, was asleep during the president\u2019s speech at the UN General Assembly yesterday. It certainly looked that way to many viewers of the speech. At one point, a camera panned to Ross and other senior White House officials in the audience for several moments, during which the commerce secretary never opened his eyes. Ross has now provided a statement to the Guardian in which he clarified that he was not asleep, merely \u201cconcentrating\u201d on the president\u2019s speech. \u201cThis is fake news,\u201d Ross said. \u201cI wear hearing aids and, during President Trump\u2019s inspiring speech, which covered in detail the entire range of significant issues facing the world, was concentrating on what was being said.\u201d Meanwhile, over on Capitol Hill \u2013 a shining example of the depth and maturity of US government \u2013 House Republicans are handing out impeachment Mad Libs in their morning caucus meeting. Many Republicans believe impeachment could be beneficial for them politically, activating their base and aggravating centrist voters who turned away from them in the 2018 midterms. There has already been some anecdotal evidence to substantiate that argument. Trump\u2019s reelection campaign and the Republican National Committee raised around $1 million yesterday by sending emails to supporters, encouraging them to join the \u201cOfficial Impeachment Defense Task Force.\u201d Trump was reportedly taken aback by Nancy Pelosi\u2019s impeachment announcement, incorrectly believing that his morning phone call to the House speaker yesterday had assuaged her concerns. Pelosi mentioned the phone call in her appearance at the Atlantic Festival yesterday. She said Trump called to discuss gun legislation but that the conversation veered into \u201cother things.\u201d The speaker declined to elaborate on what those \u201cother things\u201d were. CNN reports: He had felt confident after phoning Pelosi earlier that morning. ... It was after that call that Trump made the decision to release an \u2018unredacted\u2019 version of the transcript of his July call -- against the advice of aides such as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who warned him it would set a risky precedent. Trump wanted to undercut the argument from Democrats that he acted inappropriately, he said, and felt he had nothing to hide. But when the announcement he would release the transcript did little to quell the growing calls for his impeachment, Trump was in disbelief. Trump is still tweeting away, insisting that Democrats should \u201capologize\u201d after they see the transcript of his phone call with the Ukrainian president, which is expected to be released as soon as this morning. But Democrats have consistently said since reports of the call emerged that seeing the transcript would not be enough. They want the full whistleblower complaint, which may rely on more information than just one phone call between the two presidents. Trump and his allies are likely to argue once the transcript is released that it totally answers any and all questions Democrats might have. But Pelosi and her caucus members have already made clear that it will not stop their investigation into the call. Trump has been consistently tweeting since Nancy Pelosi made her impeachment announcement yesterday evening. The president has shared several clips from Fox News with sympathetic hosts and commentators arguing that impeachment is a desperate ploy on the part of Democrats who are hell-bent on ousting Trump. Of course, Pelosi said herself yesterday that she had tried to avoid launching a formal impeachment inquiry, despite ardent urging by many members of her caucus. The House speaker previously said she would not take this step unless she felt her caucus members had the strongest possible case to make on impeachment. Apparently she thinks that now they do. Trump continues to lash out against Democratic lawmakers in the wake of Nancy Pelosi\u2019s impeachment announcement, retweeting allies and accusing House Democrats of pursuing a \u201cWitch Hunt.\u201d Good morning, live blog readers! Well, here we are: the day after the official start of House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. With her announcement, Nancy Pelosi signaled her caucus is entering a new phase of its investigations of Donald Trump \u2013 and the president\u2019s team is already giving the House speaker plenty of material to work with. Appearing on \u201cFox and Friends\u201d this morning, Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, said the transcript of the president\u2019s call with the leader of Ukraine had been read to him. When asked whether he had heard the whole transcript, Giuliani replied, \u201cI hope.\u201d The answer is sure to spark concerns for House Democrats. Why, they might ask, was a private citizen allowed to hear the transcript of the call before the elected lawmakers who have specifically requested information on whether Trump tried to pressure the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden? Giuliani\u2019s comments come on the heals of a Washington Post report asserting that the president\u2019s personal lawyer was deeply involved with pressuring Ukraine in the hopes of politically benefiting Trump. The Post reports: \u2018Rudy \u2014 he did all of this,\u2019 one U.S. official said. \u2018This s---show that we\u2019re in \u2014 it\u2019s him injecting himself into the process.\u2019 Several officials traced their initial concerns about the path of U.S.-Ukrainian relations to news reports and interviews granted by Giuliani in which he began to espouse views and concerns that did not appear connected to U.S. priorities or policy. The former New York mayor appears to have seen [Volodymyr] Zelenskiy, a political neophyte elected president of Ukraine in April and sworn in in May, as a potential ally on two political fronts: punishing those Giuliani suspected of playing a role in exposing the Ukraine-related corruption of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, and delivering political ammunition against Biden. It seems virtually certain that Giuliani will soon be dragged in front of one (or more) House committees to answer questions on these allegations. But whether the White House will actually let him answer is far less certain. Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping its eye on today: Trump is still in New York and will meet with the Ukrainian president at 2:15 p.m. EST. The House Democratic caucus will hold a meeting this morning, where members will surely discuss next steps in the impeachment inquiry. Senator Mitt Romney and representative Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House intelligence committee, will appear at the Atlantic Festival today. That\u2019s all still coming up, so stay tuned.",

But Dennis rode an unmarked bike on Wednesday \u2013 it is believed the dispute which saw him leave the Tour de France related to equipment. Whichever trade team Dennis is riding for in 2020, his performance in Yorkshire augurs well for the Tokyo Olympics. The Australian\u2019s dominant showing, in the face of such a challenging recent period, suggests that the work of psychologist Spindler is paying dividends. If Dennis can head to Tokyo next July without any of the distractions that have plagued him this year, he will be a strong favourite to claim Olympic time trial gold.",

      "bodyText": "Human rights organisations have called on Australia to raise the minimum age of criminal responsibility by at least four years following a recommendation from the United Nations. It comes amid criticism that Australia has failed to raise the age of criminal responsibility from 10 years old despite repeated international and domestic criticism and a royal commission recommendation. At a dialogue in Geneva this month, the committee on the rights of the child chastised Australia for failing to address issues raised in its last review in 2012, including raising the age of criminal responsibility and the over-representation of Indigenous children in custody. The UN will hand down Australia\u2019s report card on implementing the provisions of the convention on the rights of the child within weeks. The committee also released a comment on children\u2019s rights in the child justice system, its first general comment on juvenile justice in the convention since 2007, recommending that the age of criminal responsibility for all nations be increased to 14 and the minimum age at which a child could be placed in detention be raised to 16. The previous recommended age was 12 years, but 14 is the average age of jurisdictions worldwide. The royal commission into the protection and detention of children in the Northern Territory in 2017 recommended the age be raised to 12 in Australia. The committee said it had increased its recommended age to reflect current research in child development and neuroscience, which says that abstract reasoning skills are not fully developed in children aged 12 and 13. \u201cState parties are encouraged to take note of recent scientific findings, and to increase their minimum age accordingly, to at least 14 years of age,\u201d the committee said. It also recommended that \u201cno child be deprived of liberty, unless there are genuine public safety or public health concerns\u201d and that countries increase the minimum age of detention to 16. Children with developmental delays \u201cshould not be in the child justice system at all, even if they have reached the minimum age of criminal responsibility.\u201d A 2018 study found that 89% of children in detention in Western Australia had a severe cognitive impairment and 36% had foetal alcohol spectrum disorder. On an average night in 2018, 59% of children in youth detention in Australia were Indigenous, meaning they were detained at 26 times the rate of their non-Indigenous peers. Sixty per cent of the youths in detention had not been sentenced. In May, every child in detention in the NT was Indigenous. \u201cWe are falling further and further behind world standards,\u201d Cheryl Axleby, co-chair of the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services said. \u201cIt\u2019s such a simple reform, yet it would make a world of difference.\u201d Axleby and the Human Rights Law Centre said the reform should lead the agenda at the next meeting of the Council of Australian Governments (Coag). WA senator Patrick Dodson said he was awaiting the outcome of a Coag working group on raising the age. He said he personally considered that the current age of 10 was \u201cfar too low and has a devastating impact on First Nations communities and families\u201d. The Indigenous affairs minister, Ken Wyatt, said the working group was still considering the issue and the Morrison government was working to improve outcomes for vulnerable youths through \u201cearly intervention programs\u201d.",
