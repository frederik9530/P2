      "bodyText": "A leading professional gamer from Hong Kong who was expelled from an international esports tournament after showing support for the city\u2019s protest movement has said he has no regrets. Chung Ng Wai, who represents the Asia-Pacific region under the name Blitzchung, had just won a crucial match at the Hearthstone Grandmasters tournament hosted in Taipei when he exclaimed in Mandarin \u201cLiberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times\u201d during a live-streamed interview. Hearthstone is a hugely popular online card game in which two opponents take turns to deploy different characters with different abilities to try to defeat each other. The 21-year-old university student, who was wearing eye goggles and a gas mask \u2013 equipment frequently used by protesters in Hong Kong \u2013 pulled down his respirator to broadcast his message. The online stream was cut off mid-interview shortly afterwards and the video has since been taken down. Chung told AFP he was not surprised at being kicked out of the competition, but said: \u201cI don\u2019t regret saying that stuff. And even now, I don\u2019t regret it at all.\u201d The Hongkonger said he had been distracted by the sometimes-violent unrest in his home city over the past four months. \u201cQuite a number of large-scale protests overlapped the competition time,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes, I couldn\u2019t focus on the competition.\u201d The makers of Hearthstone, Blizzard Entertainment, wrote in a statement Chung had broken their rules and said he would not receive any prizemoney \u2013 $10,000 according to the player \u2013 and would be banned from Hearthstone esports for a year. Those rules say players must not engage in acts that bring themselves into \u201cpublic disrepute\u201d, offend anybody or damage the developer\u2019s image. The video game industry last year generated more than $135bn globally \u2013 $43.4bn of that in the United States alone. Chung said his removal from the competition was \u201ca pity\u201d after spending four years in esports. \u201cI sacrificed time hanging out with my friends and studying because of this competition. Even though it seemed that I had wasted four years of time, I have something more important in my heart \u2013 if we lose the movement, Hong Kong will end forever.\u201d According to Bloomberg, a small stake of Activision Blizzard \u2013 the parent company of Blizzard Entertainment and one of America\u2019s biggest gaming companies \u2013 is owned by the Chinese holding company Tencent and Ng believes the developer could be bowing to Beijing\u2019s world view by silencing him. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect my comments would make a huge impact,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just expressing myself and why should I be afraid of this kind of \u2018white terror\u2019?

Memories of droughts mark time through my childhood. My dad \u2013 a stock agent \u2013 would abruptly halt conversations at the dinner table to listen to the weather on the 7pm news. After work, dust settles in the lines on his face and hands, and tints his snowy hair. A few teachers at my high school had to start coming into town to shower when the tanks on their properties ran dry during the millennium drought. My mum, a dedicated gardener, has fought to keep trees on my parents\u2019 farm alive through droughts and harsh summers, lugging heavy containers from their rainwater tank to whichever plant was closest to death. A horticulturalist once told me that if you look closely at trees around the region, you can see the ghosts of droughts in the branches and foliage that were growing at those times. This drought is often referred to by farmers as the worst in living memory, as they hand-feed their animals or consider selling off their valuable breeding stock or think about leaving the land. Growing up being constantly reminded that water is finite and rain is unreliable is in the back of my mind wherever I go. In Sydney this year I watched a man hose the footpath in front of a harbourside mansion, my mouth hanging open thinking of the crunchy brown paddocks back home. At the shops, I think about how much water is needed to produce meat, vegetables and crops, and the water needed for storing and transporting food. Driving on bumpy country roads, I think about the water needed to fix them and to build more. Looking out my window at the new homes going up in my neighbourhood, I think about the water needed for construction and housing for a growing population. Water is everywhere but increasingly it\u2019s nowhere. It\u2019s strange to me that we know water is a life-giver in many ways, but recycled drinking water is still mostly taboo. It seems to take a lot for restrictions to be enforced in major cities, where the effects of drought are out of sight out of mind. Having lived in a city for a little over a decade before returning home, I\u2019ve seen that people are not really aware that what\u2019s going down the bathroom drain, or being hosed on to cars, or poured into pools is a precious resource. Why don\u2019t we all have limits on our water use all the time, even when dams are full? Perhaps using water like it lasts forever is just a different kind of magical thinking.

The university has said it is aware of their concerns and is reviewing the terms and conditions of all its outsourced staff.</p> <p>The letter to Arthur points out that as outsourced workers, UCL\u2019s cleaners, porters and security officers, who are predominantly BAME migrant workers, are entitled to only the bare minimum sick pay, holiday leave and pension rights, far inferior to those enjoyed by staff who are directly employed.</p> <p>\u201cThis two-tier system is deeply unjust and it is hugely disappointing that UCL has maintained this system of exploitation for so long,\u201d the letter states. \u201cThis situation is unacceptable at UCL, which prides itself as a global institution and one of Britain\u2019s leading universities.\u201d</p> <p>The strike is part of a wider and ongoing campaign led by the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) to end outsourcing. There have been previous strikes by cleaners and security staff employed by the University of London (UoL) \u2013 of which UCL is a member institution \u2013 and earlier this year there was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/may/26/university-of-london-admin-centre-senate-house-boycotted-over-treatment-of-staff\">boycott of Senate House</a>, the UoL\u2019s administrative centre.</p> <p>According to IWGB, while direct employees can receive up to 26 weeks\u2019 pay if they are off sick, outsourced workers receive no pay on the first three days they are off sick, after which they are entitled to \u00a394.25 a week. As a result, many workers choose to work while sick rather than risk losing pay.</p> <p>Ciaca Carvalho, a UCL porter for 11 years, said: \u201cWe are forced to work even if we are not fit to work. We come to work just so we can eat. We work in the same building \u2013 we deserve to get the same benefits as everyone else.\u201d</p> <p>A UCL spokesperson later insisted that all the university\u2019s contractors are required to pay the London living wage. \u201cIn consultation with our recognised union, Unison, we are reviewing the current arrangements for the employment terms and conditions of our outsourced staff.</p> <p>\u201cThey are a valued part of UCL\u2019s community and we are listening to concerns that have been raised regarding their employment status. Senior leaders met with frontline Unison representatives this week and we will continue to do so.\u201d</p> <p>Maritza Castillo Calle, a former UCL cleaner who chairs the IWGB UoL branch, said: \u201cUCL would not be able to function without its cleaners, porters and security officers. However, for years the university and its contractors have been happy to treat them like second-class workers.</p> <p>\u201cWe gave UCL a clear deadline by which to present a plan to end outsourcing, which it failed to abide by. Now we are left with no option but to strike.\u201d</p> <p>The result of the strike ballot will be known on 5 November.</p>",

UCL is one of the country\u2019s leading universities, with more than 42,000 students \u2013 of which almost half are international students \u2013 and ambitious expansion plans for a second campus at the Olympic park in east London, costing in excess of \u00a3500m. Campaigners have written to UCL\u2019s provost, Prof Michael Arthur, describing the two-tier employment system as unjust and calling on him to bring all outsourced workers back in house. The university has said it is aware of their concerns and is reviewing the terms and conditions of all its outsourced staff. The letter to Arthur points out that as outsourced workers, UCL\u2019s cleaners, porters and security officers, who are predominantly BAME migrant workers, are entitled to only the bare minimum sick pay, holiday leave and pension rights, far inferior to those enjoyed by staff who are directly employed. \u201cThis two-tier system is deeply unjust and it is hugely disappointing that UCL has maintained this system of exploitation for so long,\u201d the letter states. \u201cThis situation is unacceptable at UCL, which prides itself as a global institution and one of Britain\u2019s leading universities.\u201d The strike is part of a wider and ongoing campaign led by the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) to end outsourcing. There have been previous strikes by cleaners and security staff employed by the University of London (UoL) \u2013 of which UCL is a member institution \u2013 and earlier this year there was a boycott of Senate House, the UoL\u2019s administrative centre. According to IWGB, while direct employees can receive up to 26 weeks\u2019 pay if they are off sick, outsourced workers receive no pay on the first three days they are off sick, after which they are entitled to \u00a394.25 a week. As a result, many workers choose to work while sick rather than risk losing pay. Ciaca Carvalho, a UCL porter for 11 years, said: \u201cWe are forced to work even if we are not fit to work. We come to work just so we can eat. We work in the same building \u2013 we deserve to get the same benefits as everyone else.\u201d A UCL spokesperson later insisted that all the university\u2019s contractors are required to pay the London living wage. \u201cIn consultation with our recognised union, Unison, we are reviewing the current arrangements for the employment terms and conditions of our outsourced staff. \u201cThey are a valued part of UCL\u2019s community and we are listening to concerns that have been raised regarding their employment status. Senior leaders met with frontline Unison representatives this week and we will continue to do so.\u201d Maritza Castillo Calle, a former UCL cleaner who chairs the IWGB UoL branch, said: \u201cUCL would not be able to function without its cleaners, porters and security officers. However, for years the university and its contractors have been happy to treat them like second-class workers. \u201cWe gave UCL a clear deadline by which to present a plan to end outsourcing, which it failed to abide by. Now we are left with no option but to strike.\u201d The result of the strike ballot will be known on 5 November.",

All-rounder Stokes was player of the final when England won the men\u2019s Cricket World Cup for the first time in July, before a remarkable unbeaten century at Headingley lit up the drawn Ashes series with Australia later in the summer. The 28-year-old Durham player was honoured for his heroics by being awarded the PCA Player of the Year Award at a gala dinner at the Roundhouse on 3 October. But on Tuesday, a series of images was published on the Guido Fawkes website of what appeared to be an altercation between the couple. In one image, Stokes appeared to have put his left hand on the side of his wife\u2019s face. Clare Stokes swiftly defended her husband in a Twitter post, which included a photo of her \u201csquishing up\u201d the cricketer\u2019s face as a sign of affection as well as one of them together at the awards night. She claimed a \u201cpap\u201d was trying to twist it into a \u201ccrazy story\u201d. \u201cUnbelievable what nonsense these people will make up!\u201d she said on Twitter. \u201cMe and Ben messing about squishing up each other\u2019s faces cos that\u2019s how we show affection and some pap tries to twist it in to a crazy story! And all before we then have a romantic McDonalds 20 mins later!\u201d Stokes retweeted the post. Stokes later gave a statement to the Daily Mirror in which he labelled the allegations \u201ctotally irresponsible\u201d and paid tribute to the \u201cwonderful relationship\u201d he and his wife enjoy. He said: \u201cI have become used to people making stuff up about me, but of all the topics not to mess with domestic abuse has to be at the top of the list ... For it to be toyed with for cheap headlines in this way just damages the cause of those who are abused. \u201cClare is a strong, independent woman who can speak for herself. We have a wonderful relationship and I never tire of saying how lucky I am to be with her. We both had a great night at the PCA Awards, ending with us dining out at McDonald\u2019s together. \u201cTo falsify and spread these kind of allegations so willingly is totally irresponsible. The way that this has come across is so far removed from what it was. \u201cIt was a stressful 45 minutes for us when we found out, but we wanted to address it as quickly as we could.\u201d The awards were organised by the PCA in association with the England &amp; Wales Cricket Board. Stokes lifted the Reg Hayter Cup as the NatWest PCA Players\u2019 Player of the Year. Afterwards he said: \u201cYou can take a lot of personal pride when you receive this award because it\u2019s your peers that vote for you. Earning this award is a huge moment and something I am very gracious of.\u201d After the awards ceremony Stokes and his wife, a primary school teacher, visited a McDonald\u2019s on the way back to their hotel in south-west London. The England and Wales Cricket Board chief executive, Tom Harrison, said: \u201cWe have spoken with both Clare and Ben \u2013 as well as others in attendance \u2013 who have all clarified the innocent context behind the still photographs taken at last week\u2019s PCA awards.\u201d He added: \u201cWhilst it is not the case here, we recognise that for the millions who are impacted by domestic violence, this is a very real and serious issue.\u201d Stokes is the favourite to be named BBC Sports Personality of the Year. The cricketer was arrested in Bristol in the early hours of 25 September 2017 after a night out with England teammates to celebrate victory over the West Indies in an international match earlier in the day. During a trial at Bristol crown court, the incident was described as \u201ca sustained episode of significant violence\u201d from Stokes, who had \u201clost control\u201d. Stokes told the jury he had \u201cstepped in\u201d to defend two gay men who were being verbally abused, but then had to defend himself from two men, who were threatening violence. He was found not guilty of affray. Last month Stokes described a front-page article in the Sun newspaper about a family tragedy 31 years ago as \u201cdisgusting\u201d and \u201cimmoral\u201d. In a statement on Twitter, Stokes said the paper\u2019s decision to publish the story would have \u201cgrave and lifelong consequences\u201d for his mother in particular. The article described events in New Zealand 31 years ago, before he was born, when his mother\u2019s ex-husband killed their two children before taking his own life. In his statement, Stokes said his own public profile was not an excuse to \u201cinvade\u201d the rights and privacy of his family members.",

In an article for the Guardian, Michael Lockwood, the director general of the IOPC, defended its report into Operation Midland. The IOPC was accused of a whitewash after it rejected claims that officers acted unlawfully and should face criminal prosecution or disciplinary action. Henriques has been the chief critic of the police watchdog\u2019s findings and competence. He was commissioned by the Met to review Midland after it collapsed in March 2016.

Both Proctor and Henriques were highly critical of the IOPC\u2019s findings. Henriques\u2019s report said officers acted unlawfully in obtaining search warrants and misled a judge. Lockwood said the blunders were bigger than individual officers and argued against what he called a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d: \u201cIf we want change, if we want to ensure that the failings of Operation Midland are never repeated again, it is not a witch-hunt of individuals that will prevent this, it is organisational change.\u201d He suggested that criticism has been based on misunderstandings of the way the police watchdog works and hit out at \u201cquick media soundbites\u201d.

The sanctions prompted a furious response from Beijing\u2019s embassy in Washington, which said that the US was using \u201cthe excuse of human rights\u201d to interfere in the China\u2019s internal affairs. In a string of tweets the embassy said the move \u201cseriously violates the basic norms governing international relations, interferes in China\u2019s internal affairs and undermines China\u2019s interests\u201d. The embassy said: \u201cThe counter-terrorism and de-radicalization measures in Xinjiang are aimed to eradicate the breeding soil of extremism and terrorism. They are in line with Chinese laws and international practices, and are supported by all 25 million people of various ethnic groups in Xinjiang.\u201d Inside the administration, the sanctions mark a victory for Pompeo, Vice-President Mike Pence, the administration\u2019s ambassador at large for international religious freedom, Sam Brownback, and the new deputy national security adviser, Matthew Pottinger, over the treasury secretary, Stephen Mnuchin. Mnuchin reportedly argued against sanctions that would further derail difficult trade talks. News of the sanctions drove stock prices lower on the assumption that it would make a trade deal less likely. Donald Trump himself has sought to avoid direct criticism of the Chinese government for its treatment of the country\u2019s Muslims, as well as its attempts to crush pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, so as to avoid a breakdown in his personal relations with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. At a meeting on religious freedom last month at the start of the UN general assembly, scheduled at the same time as a global climate action summit, Trump gave the keynote speech but did not mention China or the events in Xinjiang, leaving it to Pence, Pompeo and Brownback. The fact that these long-planned measures have been taken may reflect Trump\u2019s awareness of his reliance on the religious wing of the Republican party for his re-election bid next year. The state department announcement did not name the Chinese officials that had been targeted, but officials had previously pointed to the Xinjiang party secretary, Chen Quanguo, a member of the politburo.",

The analysis of Los Angeles police department (LAPD) data comes the same week that an activist coalition is launching a campaign demanding an end to these kinds of stops and reparations for people who have been wrongly searched and racially profiled. \u201cThese stops lead to the death of our people,\u201d said Melina Abdullah, co-founder of Black Lives Matter LA, which is part of the coalition launching Wednesday, called Promoting Unity Safety and Health in Los Angeles (Push LA). \u201cFor anybody who lives in communities like mine, the data is not a surprise. It\u2019s a validation of what we already know.\u201d The analysis also contradicts claims that disproportionate stops occur because of higher crime rates among certain communities, she added: \u201cThe stops aren\u2019t based on more criminality among black and brown folks \u2026 There is evidence of racism within LAPD, and these stops absolutely have to end.\u201d LAPD was forced to release the data under a new California law requiring departments to disclose traffic stop statistics. The LA Times analyzed records of more than 385,000 drivers and passengers pulled over from July 2018 through April 2019. The severe racial disparities started with the stops: even though LA\u2019s population is 9% black, roughly 27% of people pulled over were black. White people make up 28% of the city, but roughly 18% of stops. Latinos were 47% of stops, which roughly matches their population size. Asians, who make up 11% of the city, represented 4% of stops. For black and Latino drivers, minor equipment violations, such as a broken taillight, made up 20% of the stops compared with only 11% of stops for white people. These types of stops allow police to harass and search people of color without justification, activists said. \u201cIt\u2019s fishing. It\u2019s casting a broad net,\u201d said Alberto Retana, president of Community Coalition, a south LA not-for-profit group spearheading the new Push LA campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s criminalizing poor folks that aren\u2019t a threat to the community. What we have here is a policy of systematically targeting [the black] population. That is institutional bias.\u201d Bryant Mangum, a 37-year-old warehouse foreman who lives in south LA, told the Guardian he is regularly pulled over in his neighborhood when he drives his BMW. \u201cWe\u2019re tired of being mistreated and pre-judged and racially profiled,\u201d said Mangum, who said he rarely drives the BMW anymore, especially at night, because of the likelihood of a stop. \u201cMy wife fears anytime I drive it, not because of anyone robbing me, but she fears the cops.\u201d When he drove his children to school last week, an LAPD car followed him for roughly a mile, he said: \u201cMy heart was beating, and it\u2019s a couple minutes of worry and anxiety.\u201d Several years ago, he said, he was stopped by police for double parking outside the home he owns. In places like west LA or Santa Monica, he said, he was \u201cmuch safer and less targeted\u201d than his Green Meadows neighborhood, adding that it felt like police were trying to push people out by harassing them. \u201cI know this community well, it\u2019s a community I love, and I don\u2019t want to leave,\u201d said Mangum, who is advocating for policy changes with the new coalition. \u201cThe numbers are staggering and should be a wake-up call to everybody.\u201d Push LA\u2019s campaign is calling on LAPD to compensate people who have been searched recently and had nothing on them, said Retana: \u201cA small step the city can take is to pay back people for the undo harm created by these stops.\u201d In a statement to the Guardian, Michel Moore, LAPD\u2019s chief, defended the agency\u2019s record, saying, \u201cWhile the numbers presented reflect racial disparities when compared to the proportions of residential population, they do not define or describe the circumstances of each stop or search \u2026 [and] neither prove nor disprove racial profiling or other improper action.\u201d He added that LAPD \u201chas no tolerance for any officer that would use race as a basis for a stop or search\u201d. Abdullah, however, noted that LAPD\u2019s own data shows that hundreds of citizens have filed complaints of \u201cbiased policing\u201d in recent years, but that the department has declined to sustain any of those allegations. Mayor Eric Garcetti called the report \u201cimportant and timely\u201d in a statement, adding that an LAPD inspector general was studying the subject of vehicle stops. He noted that the department had implemented body cameras, trained officers in implicit bias, expanded community partnerships and launched \u201crecruitment campaigns to embrace and expand diversity\u201d. Last week, however, LAPD faced widespread backlash after recruitment ads for new officers appeared on Breitbart, a far-right website. The department said it was a mistake and suspended its Google ads as a result.",

Given he also took another heavy illegal blow the previous week courtesy of the USA\u2019s John Quill in Kobe, Farrell has definitely been in the wars, even before he was forced out of Tuesday\u2019s training session because of an upset stomach.</p> <p>According to all and sundry within the England camp, however, Farrell was not dazed or suffering from concussion in any shape or form. How interesting, then, to hear Wisemantel acknowledge that the coaches\u2019 post-match review had indeed raised a couple of midfield question-marks. \u201cIn and around him there were a few things that were clunky and that I need to fix this week,\u201d confirmed the Australian. \u201cIt is not just Owen, there are other things that I see that aren\u2019t perfect that we need to get right.\u201d</p> <p>As always with such things, everything has to be placed in context. George Ford has been playing outstandingly well at 10, England have won all three of their pool games to date and despite spluttering at times against the Pumas they still registered six tries. Against top opposition, though, England will need both the Ford-Farrell axis and the Farrell-Tuilagi centre combination to fire consistently. At his best Farrell would still make most teams in the world but, for whatever reason, he has started this tournament relatively quietly.</p> <p>It could yet be that, with his training preparations having been disrupted by illness and England already qualified for the last eight, Eddie Jones decides that, on balance, there is more value in resting Farrell for Saturday\u2019s France game.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wisemantel confirms that possibility will be discussed but, either way, believes there is nothing major to worry about. \u201cHe is a tough, competitive player who, because he competes so hard, probably tries to over-rectify situations.\u201d</p> <p>Farrell, he argues, is simply filling an unselfish supporting role and also playing a key part in drawing some of the heat from his friend Ford. \u201cThe thing about the dynamic is that Owen becomes more of a runner at 12. You can pull it apart and say he is not his usual self [but] you are seeing a different Owen. You are not seeing the distributor all the time because George fills that role. It\u2019s the two of them changing roles, that\u2019s all it is. I don\u2019t think you can read too much into it as far as Owen\u2019s performance is concerned. He did the role that we wanted him to play. I don\u2019t think the bump had any effect on him. I asked after the game and he said he felt pretty good. We have reviewed the game and there are a couple of areas we need to pick up on, but he was fine.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/08/england-billy-vunipola-france-rugby-world-cup\">England poised to leave out Billy Vunipola for France World Cup match</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is also the case that England\u2019s World Cup pursuit is a collective rather than individual enterprise. If Farrell were only to land every penalty and conversion he attempts, defend stoutly (and legally), offer an effective midfield second kicking option and strike the right tone in the team huddle he would still be contributing more to the cause than most people. That said, if England wish to secure the Webb Ellis Cup they cannot settle for second best en route. \u201cWhen I say clunky, I am a perfectionist,\u201d emphasised Wisemantel. \u201cYou are never going to get a perfect game of rugby. We scored six tries, five of them to the backs, so we are not too clunky.\u201d</p> <p>It is also his view that England would still have beaten Argentina convincingly even had the Pumas not been reduced to 14 men so early. \u201cI think you could see the writing on the wall even before the red card. I think the result would have been very similar with 15. There\u2019s a real steeliness to the way the boys are approaching their work, with a concerted effort to put pressure on the opposition and turn the screws.\u201d France, in summary, should expect no respite, Farrell or no Farrell. </p>",

According to all and sundry within the England camp, however, Farrell was not dazed or suffering from concussion in any shape or form. How interesting, then, to hear Wisemantel acknowledge that the coaches\u2019 post-match review had indeed raised a couple of midfield question-marks. \u201cIn and around him there were a few things that were clunky and that I need to fix this week,\u201d confirmed the Australian. \u201cIt is not just Owen, there are other things that I see that aren\u2019t perfect that we need to get right.\u201d As always with such things, everything has to be placed in context. George Ford has been playing outstandingly well at 10, England have won all three of their pool games to date and despite spluttering at times against the Pumas they still registered six tries. Against top opposition, though, England will need both the Ford-Farrell axis and the Farrell-Tuilagi centre combination to fire consistently. At his best Farrell would still make most teams in the world but, for whatever reason, he has started this tournament relatively quietly. It could yet be that, with his training preparations having been disrupted by illness and England already qualified for the last eight, Eddie Jones decides that, on balance, there is more value in resting Farrell for Saturday\u2019s France game. Wisemantel confirms that possibility will be discussed but, either way, believes there is nothing major to worry about. \u201cHe is a tough, competitive player who, because he competes so hard, probably tries to over-rectify situations.\u201d Farrell, he argues, is simply filling an unselfish supporting role and also playing a key part in drawing some of the heat from his friend Ford. \u201cThe thing about the dynamic is that Owen becomes more of a runner at 12. You can pull it apart and say he is not his usual self [but] you are seeing a different Owen. You are not seeing the distributor all the time because George fills that role. It\u2019s the two of them changing roles, that\u2019s all it is. I don\u2019t think you can read too much into it as far as Owen\u2019s performance is concerned. He did the role that we wanted him to play. I don\u2019t think the bump had any effect on him. I asked after the game and he said he felt pretty good. We have reviewed the game and there are a couple of areas we need to pick up on, but he was fine.\u201d It is also the case that England\u2019s World Cup pursuit is a collective rather than individual enterprise. If Farrell were only to land every penalty and conversion he attempts, defend stoutly (and legally), offer an effective midfield second kicking option and strike the right tone in the team huddle he would still be contributing more to the cause than most people. That said, if England wish to secure the Webb Ellis Cup they cannot settle for second best en route. \u201cWhen I say clunky, I am a perfectionist,\u201d emphasised Wisemantel. \u201cYou are never going to get a perfect game of rugby. We scored six tries, five of them to the backs, so we are not too clunky.\u201d It is also his view that England would still have beaten Argentina convincingly even had the Pumas not been reduced to 14 men so early. \u201cI think you could see the writing on the wall even before the red card. I think the result would have been very similar with 15. There\u2019s a real steeliness to the way the boys are approaching their work, with a concerted effort to put pressure on the opposition and turn the screws.\u201d France, in summary, should expect no respite, Farrell or no Farrell.",

      "bodyText": "A very fun week in the tent tonight: excellent chemistry and a brillo (pad?) showstopper. All smiles until everyone\u2019s non-biological grandson Michael had to pack his bags. Finally off to uni. Congratulations to Henry though, who\u2019s relaxing more every week, even as his tie gets tighter. Thanks for your oodles of comments, noodling discursions on cheese and excellent lookalikes. See you next week. Those inclined, do say hello on twitter or instagram. Or if you want to split my heart apart like weak-sealed ravioli, buy my book! Later potaters x Was a done deal the moment he Platini\u2019d that doughball. But Michael goes home. NOOOOOOOO! Gotta be Henny Penny @darbles Your description of Michael hits the nail on the head so hard the nail is currently concussed in A&amp;E Let\u2019s try and answer a lower stakes question. Michael or David\u2019s lips? (If you feel qualified to answer, you are.) @jdsworld I think you\u2019re right. But this is actually tense and unpredictable. Not all thoughts need to be externalised, Rhik GO ON Alice. That looks amazing! Has she just won showstopper? But still in danger of going home? No. But then who is? I would struggle to crack an egg under this pressure. Yet David has produced an edible sculpture that looks like the centrepiece of an Olympic bid. HOW. Michael is in trouble. Alice too, probs. Henry\u2019s \u2018stack of egg sandwiches\u2019 impresses though. Could Lawless Henry take this, with his gang of hoods? Steph needs grouting in her otherwise excellent cake. Rosie has great ambition, but hasn\u2019t mastered the technicalities. HMMM. Predictions please, people I\u2019ve got a cake, I\u2019ve got a cake.\u201d Michael arguably setting his bar a little lower than the rest. Mind you, Rosie has some sort of assassin-grade cheese wire. Iron Fringe removes her cape and walks to face her. She will show her flying fist of Judah. Kake Fu will decide this. David with his bread slicer! He is so the Batman of this task. \u201cDoes it come in every colour other than black?\u201d Iron Fringe looks down from the throne with steel eyes, giving nothing away. ROSIE HAS BURNT HER LAYERS. (Sorry Lairs. Mary B, we need you!) The contestants are not enjoying the quirky presenter chats are they? It\u2019s like they\u2019re trying to get out of the Crystal Maze and everything\u2019s on fire. In no mood for juggling, or bowl balancing malarkey. The thing is I\u2019d eat this too. There\u2019s almost nothing I wouldn\u2019t Michael\u2019s shirt is basically a Sarawak. Advantage Michael? What do we think Noel was picturing when he said \u2018Essex girl\u2019? DAVID JUST MADE A PRUE LEITH NECKLACE JOKE. He has to drink for ever, because he has gamed and won the bingo. Rosie is gunning for Iron Fringe Gelfling, isn\u2019t she. She\u2019s weaponising her eggy rubber, because when you come for the champ you better not miss. @jellygenie YES, Steph looks EXACTLY like a gelfling. That dossier is bulging like Alice\u2019s cassatelle. If someone told me to make one of these, I would sit down on the floor and cry. Or go really distant, full Bartleby. \u201cI would prefer not to.\u201d Am now obsessed with the idea of grilled cake. Why has no one sent me a grilled cake? Unhappy birthday to me. Lol at David knowing the history of this Southeast Asian cake, right down to its trade routes. Henry: \u201cI\u2019ve heard of Malaysia.\u201d I\u2019ve just googled these and they look GORGEOUS. Ketchup Saruman? Catch Susan Sarandon? Give me a break, guys Sandi\u2019s hair looks like cream cheese. I sort of...want to taste it. ER, you say? I could watch that. @orbitalgirl Michael as young Rik Mayall is definitely something. It\u2019s not nothing. If only he would put his head through the window and grin maniacally. But it\u2019s quite hard in a tent. Update the Steph dossier I repel first.\u201d David is perpetually the bridesmaid in these tasks, isn\u2019t he? Yet he\u2019s hardly put a foot wrong all series. He\u2019s there, in the slipstream at the top. Could easily stride out in front come the final furlong. Also I\u2019m finding Rosie quite charming this episode. Perpetually good humoured. Alice\u2019s sea-creature pastries won\u2019t net her any prizes, while Steph\u2019s thick walls would make her a good neighbour. David\u2019s air holes disappoint, but he nails it nonetheless. Poor, overworked Alice comes last, but has Michael to keep her company. Rosie wins! Is cheese and chocolate good? Oh yes sorry, baking. Er, they\u2019re deep frying Cornish pasties? I don\u2019t like when you do posh filled pasta and one of them splits in the pot and you end up poaching the others in a sink water-looking broth, then have to eat one sad, empty pasta-sack. Makes me wish I was a baby again. No problems back then. Jaysus, the chemistry between Sandi and Henry as he directs her to crank his pastry-roller. Would not have seen that coming, for many reasons. It\u2019s weird. I also...want to see more? Steph looks actually annoyed at Noel\u2019s whimsy. This is the downside of telling the bakers to make a helium tiramisu in two minutes that relates to their childhood in some way. They\u2019re all really stressed. That cheese teste Michael is milking is far too wet. Nope. Sort of like Nutella tortelloni, from what I can tell? Anyone? Once popular, but outmoded by CD-lians and Minidisc-atelle Henry gets a Hollywood handshake too! They\u2019re like buses this week. Sure Paul\u2019s after being the queen at a variety performance isn\u2019t he? Shut up!\u201d Henry on getting a Hollywood handshake. Normal reaction. Noel\u2019s peacock feather headdress isn\u2019t vegan is it? (I think there is a peacock feather alternative made from whipping chickpea water set with agar, but only bushbabies have the delicate hands to do it. Ironic.) I would eat the namalaka out of Rosie\u2019s flamingo doughnuts. Michael\u2019s figgy-too-much does surprisingly well. Go on lad. Steph gets a Hollywood handshake though! In the meantime, let\u2019s do a sweepstake on how much Prue\u2019s lemon necklace weighs. I say nine kilograms. @demelzaza yes, David\u2019s Pride top is gorge. @emilyscatnaps yes, \u201cRosie\u2019s namalaka\u201d is absolutely top drawer. Unlike my plate cupboard. That\u2019s a lovely McCain advert, but I assure you Love does care about you burning the burger buns. Why are you even toasting them? moves like Henry Still laughing at Henry describing hacky sack with hot cross doughballs as the best thing he\u2019s ever done. Uncool hand Luke. The boy is off the rails and I am here for it. Can you all help me? The little hollow section under my oven. Is that a plate warming compartment, baking tray storage, or a proving drawer? Look at him sitting next to a fridge looking like Tom Hardy in Bronson, for no reason. Paul is being extra Stasi this week. Rosie is so much a character from The Good Life I\u2019m genuinely confused she isn\u2019t peering aghast over a fence at a suggestive squash. Henry has won this already by introducing us to the word kardemumabullar tbh. Oh I love a springy dough! David\u2019s is making me feel feelings. I want that clammy bounce under my hands. Oh yes do a hot cross bun Steph there is little I love more. Michael\u2019s figgy brandy marzipan Easter situation is...a lot. I wish Phil was here to make an Eid bun, hoisted by Noddy Covered in glitter, yeasty from the camping. I forget Alice is a teacher. That would explain why she looks mad all the time. Imagine trying to teach a gaggle of hormone-explosions about oxbow lakes when all they want to do is inject YouTube into their veins and make mistakes they will think about for 30 years. \u201cFestive buns from around the world\u201d\u2013 I love the Notting Hill carnival! Is the level of coarseness I expect us to rise above tonight Ooh here we actually go! You know what: parliamentary democracy, but no one can propose a bill until they\u2019ve perfected a Genoese sponge would not be worse than the current set up. Here we go, everyone! Technical challenge: SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE Wait, what\u2019s happening I\u2019m eating Kew Garden chocolate with honey in it from bees that went to private school. Disappointingly great Anyway welcome all! Bingo? Bingo. Drink one of Heidi\u2019s 50 ciders when you see anything along the lines of: Henry wearing leathers and biking boots, with a tie underneath. David staring into a mirror glaze a touch too long. Sandi\u2019s eyes betraying her feelings during a weakly scripted link. Steph caught with a gingerbread cheat sheet under her fringe. Prue reacting to a blueberry cream like it\u2019s a bowl of ebola. @Darbles I would bet both kidneys Helena is baking Day of the Dead biscuits somewhere. Possibly the actual underworld. ID87652...something, I applaud and admire the alacrity of your baseless speculations @Heidi writing \u201cI have one cider\u201d ten times is not a breathalyser loophole.

On Tuesday morning, BDMLR appealed for information but later confirmed that the animal had been seen dead at about 5pm. The humpback whale was thought by the Port of London Authority to measure around 10 metres (33ft) in length. The Port of London Authority will attempt to recover the animal\u2019s body for examinations by whale experts. A member of the species was spotted in the Channel last week, according to BDMLR, but it is not clear whether this was the same one. Last year, a beluga whale, nicknamed Benny the Beluga, spent more than three months in the Thames. It is thought to have made its own way back out to sea in the new year.",

      "bodyText": "Thanks for reading and for your emails. Stay tuned for Suzy Wrack\u2019s match report. Hopefully our video team gets something up on that howler, so you can enjoy it in all its pixelated glory. Bye! Looking forward to what spin Neville is going to try and put on this. I think if he was giving a honest assessment in the dressing room, he would be tearing into his players. I expect his words to the media will be quite different, no doubt \u2018taking the positives\u2019. England end their winless run, thanks to one of the worst goalkeeping errors I\u2019ve ever seen. Portugal were so unlucky not to snatch a draw at the death. It was a pretty turgid performance from England. 90+4 min: Neto curls her effort over the wall, it hits the underside of the bar, bounces down, looks as though it is going to hit Roebuck on the back and roll into the net, but somehow rolls up her torso and into her arms, right on the goal-line! How did that not go in?! 90+3 min: Hang on! A couple of untidy fouls give Portugal a brilliant position right on the edge of England\u2019s box! Portugal have a chance to snatch a draw here! Neto stands over it .... 90+2 min: It\u2019s been a disappointing performance, but Neville will just be delighted to end that winless run. 90 min: Two minutes added on here. 87 min: The 19-year-old comes on for Mead, and almost instantly bursts past her marker on the right wing, curling her shot into the side netting. She is frighteningly quick. 85 min: Portugal are now opting for a high press and it\u2019s playing into England\u2019s hands as Houghton and Williamson simply play through them. 84 min: Portugal make two more changes: Ferreira Gomes and Ferreira Pinto come on for Vanessa Marques and Jessica Silva. 83 min: \u201cGiven you added a Cranberries video to a post about a Delores, couldn\u2019t you have done a Duran Duran video along with the update on Taylor? (Note that I didn\u2019t suggest Swift)\u201c asks Peter Oh. Go on then. 81 min: Neville will be happy to just break the run of winless games, but that goal is really such a terrible way to win. In truth, England should be battering teams like Portugal. It goes to show how lacking in confidence England are at the moment. 78 min: Jessica Silva wins a soft free-kick on the edge of England\u2019s area, much to Parris\u2019s annoyance. This is actually an excellent chance for Portugal, but the delivery lands square on Greenwood\u2019s head and away. 76 min: And so it proves. Portugal are almost immediately opened up, with Mead flashing a shot wide. Taylor nearly turned that ball in, but she was standing in an offside position. 74 min: Portugal make a change: Pires Neto, Portugal\u2019s most capped player here and arguably their most creative, comes on for Ana Borges. Portugal are going to change their shape, the game will probably become a lot more open from hereon in. This is one of the worst goalkeeper howlers you are ever likely to see. Such a shame, because Morais has been superb all night, but inexplicably drops a looping cross at the near post. The ball simply rolls across the goalline, and Mead is there to stab it into the net from all of three centimetres out. 69 min: England suddenly look like a different team with Taylor up front. She is comfortable leading the line by herself and gets another header on target, again saved by Morais. 67 min: How are England not ahead?! Taylor so nearly makes an immediate impact, latching onto a wonderful slide-rule pass. Once again Morais comes out bravely to foil the substitute, but the ball squirms loose and Nobbs has a chance to tuck away the rebound ... a quite magnificent block from Carole Costa keeps the scores goalless. Taylor actually could have scored from a third chance in that phase of play but tamely heads the ball wide after Mead crossed. Portugal hanging on here. 65 min: England make a double change in response: Taylor and Nobbs come on for England and Daly. I think we\u2019ll see Bronze go to right back now, as England reshuffle their midfield. 63 min: Thank god, a substitution. Portugal\u2019s Caroline Mendes comes off for the suspiciously English sounds Alexandra Norton, who plays as an attacking midfielder for Inter Milan. 60 min: Borges is clipped by Mead. The former goes down hard, clutching her knee. Mead laughs as the theatrics, as a corner of Portugal supporters get mildly annoyed. 55 min: Beth Mead is not playing right wing, swapping with Parris. I hope Neville has something else up his sleeve. Taylor in particular must be itching to get off the bench. 53 min: It\u2019s a very bitty game, as Carole Costa has two of three bites of Bronze in midfield. We badly need a goal. 51 min: Portugal\u2019s captain, Delores Silva, goes into the book for a cynical tug on Mead as England were counter-attacking. A brilliant foul to give away, England had numbers forward there. Pep would be proud of that one. 49 min: Greenwood there, with a good old scouse \u201ceff off\u201d after a throw goes against England. You love to see it. 47 min: Staniforth, arguably England\u2019s best player in the first half, is down. It\u2019s unclear if that is a contact injury - she was caught late by Monica Mendes - or if she\u2019s pulled her hamstring. England are back out early. Bronze and Houghton are leading the huddle. There are a LOT of words being exchanged. England look up for it. Portugal saunter out to take their place. David Squires, ladies and gentlemen. Half-time reading: Phil Neville will want to see more in the second half. Portugal will be happy with their work, they have frustrated England. 45+1 min: Chance for England! Beth England finds some room on the left-hand side of the box, but another heavy touch means she can\u2019t get a shot off on her own. Instead, she digs out a decent cross, which is well cleared by Mendes at the back post! She got a crucial touch to deny Parris! 45 min: In truth, this has been a poor end to the half for England. They\u2019ve only created two major chances since kick-off. One minute added on for injury time. 43 min: Penalty shout for England! Bronze is absolutely adamant that she was held back by Rebelo - replays show that she was - but the ball was probably just out of her control. You can see why it wasn\u2019t given, even if Portugal were taking a chance there. 41 min: Somebody that has taken her chance to impress is Lucy Staniforth. She\u2019s linking the play really nicely, breaking the lines and creating little triangles in the middle of the pitch, where Fidalgo and Pinto are snapping at her heels. 39 min: Oooooooo, lovely skill from Jessica Silva, who gets away from both Greenwood and Bronze with a Zidane roulette turn. One for the highlights reel, that one, to leave the England pair looking a little bit stupid. 37 min: Beth England is having a poor half. She\u2019s been isolated going forward and has not held the ball up well at all. Would not be surprised to see her hooked at half-time. A real shame on her first start for England. 35 min: Good battle between Greenwood and Borges on Portugal\u2019s right flank. Both are fierce tacklers, which Borges showed during her time with Chelsea a few years ago. 32 min: Mead has been England\u2019s biggest threat down the left, and the Arsenal winger so nearly opens the scoring. Once again, a magnificent diagonal pass from Houghton catches Portugal cold. Mead drives towards the byline, checks and floats a cross to the back post, which just falls the wrong side of the post, and just beyond Parris, who was sprinting in to try and tap it into the net. 30 min: Half an hour gone. Phil Neville is looking tense in his waistcoat. 28 min: A lucky rebound flicks off Walsh and so nearly deflects through to Jessica Silva, but a brilliant last-ditch challenge from Daly clears England\u2019s lines. So nearly calamitous for England. 26 min: Vanessa Marques does well to tidy up after an England attack breaks down on the edge of Portugal\u2019s box, spreading the ball wide to Ana Borges, but it\u2019s a poor delivery into the box, which is easily claimed by Roebuck. 23 min: Better from England, who are starting to move it a bit quicker. Bronze gets a shot off at goal, but Morais gathers easily. 20 min: Parris goes down in a heap after coming off second best with a aerial duel with Jessica Silva. A quick squeeze of the magic sponge and she\u2019s OK to continue. 18 min: England have had all the possession. Interesting that Leah Williamson isn\u2019t playing in midfield today. Neville has talked about trying to get her into midfield in recent days. What it does mean is that England have two cracking passers of the ball at centre-back, with Houghton also there. 16 min: A nasty, late challenge on Staniforth leaves Houghton with a free-kick opportunity 25 yards from goal. She so often buries these in the WSL, but this time it\u2019s a tame effort into the wall, hastily assembled by Ana Borges. 14 min: Chance for England (and England)! A wonderful move starts with Houghton stepping out of defence with the ball, beating a defender and firing a perfect ball into Staniforth, who steps over it. Mead is free on the left and drives into the area, flashing her cross shot across goal. England sticks out a toe, but can\u2019t connect. Anything on that, and that\u2019s a goal. 12 min: Speaking of pace, England are playing a high line at the back, and Jessica Silva seems to be playing through the middle. She\u2019s just signed for Lyon, and is absolutely rapid. 10 min: Brilliant keeping from Morais! A wonderful through ball from Bronze finds England, but the striker\u2019s touch is a little heavy and Portugal\u2019s keeper steams out to dive bravely at England\u2019s feet, who was one step off the pace. 8 min: Interesting to know what Phil Neville would regard as a good result here. It\u2019s an experimental line-up, but anything less than a comfortable win would again be thought of as a disappointment. 6 min: So it looks like Bronze is playing in a holding role in midfield, with Daly playing at right back. 4 min: England have looked very suspect from crosses recently, both goals conceded against Brazil came from wide areas, and Jessica Silva gets free down the right. A nice knockdown to Mendes sees the forward get a left-footed shot off, but Houghton is there to clear. Not a convincing start from Greenwood at left back. 2 min: England work a corner short, and Beth England connects well with the eventual cross, looping a header straight at Morais. That was not too dissimilar to her goal against Brazil on Saturday. We are underway in Portugal, England are in their changed all-red strip, Portugal in a white number. Peeeeeeeeeeep! And here are the rest of the full-time results in Euro qualifying. A 13-0 win for Norway against the Faroe Islands, with Isabell Herlovsens scoring a hat-trick to move ahead of Marianne Pettersen as Norway\u2019s all-time top scorer. A massive result for Wales, who score late on through Rachel Rowe, who squeezed her shot into the far corner after doing well to pick up a loose ball from a corner. Belarus were Wales\u2019 nearest challenger in Pool C of the Euro qualifying so that has put clear daylight between the two sides. Disappointing to not see Diana Silva start up front. An extremely experienced line up, Jessica Silva is probably the chief threat on Portugal\u2019s right wing. In case you missed this piece by Suzy Wrack, it\u2019s well worth your time. Lucy Bronze was a few months from choosing Portugal over England for her international allegiance, back in the day, owing to her Portuguese father Joaquim. What a loss that would have been for England. Regardless, both sides of her family are on hand to watch her in action tonight. A couple of live games this evening to catch you up on: Wales are lucky to still be drawing 0-0 with Belarus in their World Cup qualifier, with Anastasia Shcherbachenia missed a golden chance to put the hosts in front. It\u2019s only six degrees in Borisov! Elsewhere, England\u2019s U19s have beaten Serbia 6-0, with Jessica Park netting a hat-trick! What a prospect the young 17-year-old Man City striker looks to be. As ever, Steph Houghton captains England. It was her husband Stephen Darby\u2019s birthday on Sunday, the day after England\u2019s match against Brazil. You can still donate to the DarbyRimmer Foundation. Beth England does indeed get a start in place of Jodie Taylor, young Man City keeper Ellie Roebuck gets a chance in goal instead of Mary Earps, who perhaps could have done better with Brazil\u2019s opening goal on Saturday. Leah Williamson is expected to take her place in midfield, after impressing there for Arsenal this season, while Jill Scott\u2019s ankle injury means Lucy Staniforth gets a chance to impress. Much of the talk before this friendly has been about Phil Neville, and yep, it\u2019s true, the Lionesses manager is probably facing his toughest spell since he took over in January 2018. Neville has said as much, admitting yesterday that he and his side are \u201cin a downward trough\u201d at the moment, after Saturday\u2019s 2-1 home defeat to Brazil made it five matches without a win. However, talk of a crisis is perhaps a tad premature: at the World Cup, England were a converted penalty away from taking the eventual champions, USA, into extra-time, while recent narrow defeats to Sweden and Norway should be regarded as a minor setback rather than a red flag. In all, it\u2019s been a brilliant year for England with victory at the SheBelieves Cup and Lucy Bronze being voted the best player in Europe. This friendly just outside Lisbon is the perfect opportunity for England to get back on track. Portugal are ranked 26 places below the Lionesses in the Fifa rankings but they are no mugs, losing this fixture by the odd goal in the 2017 Euros, a tournament in which they beat Scotland 2-1. Portugal have a lovely blend of experience of youth and are certainly growing the game on home soil, with veterans of over 100 caps such as Carole Costa and Ana Borges returning from clubs like Atletico Madrid and Chelsea home to play in the Portuguese league. Up front, they\u2019ve got pace to burn, watch out for Diana Silva in particular, who should give Steph Houghton plenty to think about at the back tonight. For England, Neville has the option of starting Beth England, who impressed in her substitute appearance against Brazil, scoring a wonderful headed goal, and generally providing some cutting edge on an off day for Beth Mead and Jodie Taylor.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Wednesday 9 October. Top stories As many as 20 homes may have been lost in an out-of-control bushfire burning in northern NSW. The blaze at Busbys Flat, south of Casino, was one of two that were still at emergency warning levels on Tuesday night. The NSW Rural Fire Service said a number of homes in the village of Rappville, with a population of about 250 people, were destroyed when the fire ripped through the town. \u201cI\u2019ve lost the bloody sheds, the house, lost everything,\u201d a resident, Danny Smith, told reporters on the scene. Donald Trump has said he prevented the US ambassador to the EU from testifying to congressional impeachment hearings, calling them a \u201ckangaroo court\u201d. Democrats leading the impeachment investigation said ambassador Gordon Sondland\u2019s lawyers had been called by a state department official after midnight, leaving a voicemail message ordering him not to attend Tuesday\u2019s hearings. The late-night call came after Sondland handed over WhatsApp messages and other communications from his personal devices to the state department, which was refusing to provide them to the House committees holding the impeachment hearings. House Democrats have responded by moving to subpoena Sondland. Christopher Pyne\u2019s firm is lobbying for a company that won more than $2m in contracts from the defence department in the past year. Tender records show Saber, in the 12 months before it engaged the former defence minister\u2019s lobbying firm GC Advisory, won three contracts with the defence department worth about $2.7m. The contracts were all awarded through an open and competitive process and there is no suggestion of impropriety, but concerns have been raised about the engagement of Pyne\u2019s firm. The lobbying code prohibits former government ministers from engaging \u201cin lobbying activities relating to any matter that they had official dealings with in their last 18 months in office\u201d. World Talks aimed at reaching a Brexit deal are on the brink of collapse, as a No 10 source said Angela Merkel was making a deal impossible and Brussels accused Boris Johnson of trying to play a \u201cstupid blame game\u201d. Turkey has vowed to press ahead with attacks on Kurdish-led forces in Syria, despite confusion over US policy after officials appeared to backtrack on Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw troops from the area. At least 13 women have died and eight children are missing after a boat capsized in rough seas off the Italian island of Lampedusa on Sunday night as a patrol vessel attempted to save it. More than 100 children are among thousands of people detained in Egypt in an effort to prevent further protests against the rule of Abdel-Fatah al-Sisi. Ecuador has moved its government from the capital in Quito amid violent protests over the end of fuel subsidies. Opinion and analysis Military buff Tony Abbott is the wrong choice for the Australian War Memorial, writes Paul Daley. \u201cPeter Stanley, the winner of the 2011 prime minister\u2019s prize for Australian History, says it has been too long since a professional historian was on the war memorial council and that Abbott is no substitute. Stanley is among many notable Australians who have opposed the controversial plans \u2013 hatched by the current memorial director, Brendan Nelson \u2013 to spend $500m on expanding the institution so that it can showcase more military hardware and mount exhibitions on current conflicts.\u201d Australia\u2019s music industry is in dire need of performance spaces, writes Brigid Delaney. \u201cOnly a few years ago, Tim Heath was playing bass in the Basics and touring the world. Now he\u2019s on the other side of the stage, running a 165-year-old live music venue in country Victoria, with his musician wife, Felicity Cripps. The pair took over the lease of the 1854 heritage theatre in Castlemaine in 2016, and have transformed it from a dilapidated building into a cultural hub. But when they signed the lease in 2016, Cripps and Heath had only 10 days until they had to open \u2013 so a small team worked 18-hour days. \u2018It was filthy \u2013 centuries of crap we had to try and take to the tip,\u2019 says Heath.\u201d Sport The Premier League faces losing one of its automatic Champions League places under proposals being floated by the European Leagues. Football fans in Australia can be quick to point out everything that\u2019s wrong with the domestic scene, write Richard Parkin and Jonathan Howcroft. But on the eve of another A-League season, there are reasons to be cheerful. The Socceroos will seek to cash in on resource-poor Nepal in World Cup qualifier on Thursday, writes John Duerden. \u201cThe visitors have just one usable pitch back in Nepal and anything other than a comfortable home win is unthinkable.\u201d Thinking time: Up the Duff \u201cIt makes me emotional, knowing that hundreds of thousands of pregnant women over the last 20 years have had my \u2018voice\u2019 in their head for the journey,\u201d writes Kaz Cooke, author of Up the Duff and its sequel, Babies &amp; Toddlers. \u201cReaders tend to read it week by week as they progress in pregnancy, and they say, \u201cHow did you know I\u2019d have a stuffed nose that week?\u201d or, \u201c I started to cry watching the news the exact same time you mentioned it.\u201d Partly it\u2019s because I took notes during my own pregnancy, about physical hassles, but also about feelings \u2013 something largely ignored by pregnancy books at the time.

Like so many of the mistakes you can make in Japan, you\u2019ll figure out this one the very minute after you\u2019ve committed it, because the pig will squeal loudly. So, now you know. Be warned though, because, as Peter Carey writes in his book Wrong About Japan, after a particularly humiliating encounter in which he tried to impress an interviewee with his half-baked theories about manga, \u201chalf knowledge is sometimes much worse than complete ignorance\u201d.</p> <p>Knowing that it is rude to put your towel in the water at the public baths, for instance, only makes it that much more embarrassing when you accidentally do. And since the only spares are kept back by the front desk, there\u2019s no way out that won\u2019t leave you feeling awfully soggy and sheepish.</p> <p>So far, after nine matches in six cities, five of them in the space of just seven days, and three thousand-odd miles of air, road and rail travel, the World Cup has been a beginner\u2019s course in the all the many mistakes you can make while navigating your way around Japan. You might think that if you\u2019ve tackled the London rush hour on a regular basis you can cope with anything the Tokyo subway can throw at you in the morning. But the third time you get elbowed aside by the little old lady you were trying to let by you realise that this is an entirely different, and far more vicious proposition, one which only a lunatic would attempt while carrying a large backpack and suitcase.</p> <p>And you may know that it is essential to have a well thought-out karaoke strategy, that the classic English technique of getting hammered and singing badly isn\u2019t going to cut it after your host has just knocked out a near-note-perfect Sinatra number. Best, then, to consider your limitations while you\u2019re still sober and pick out a selection of well-known songs that you\u2019re quite sure fall within your vocal range. I was talking about exactly that with a colleague from another newspaper just the other night. He\u2019d been thinking about it and had settled on \u201csomething by Johnny Cash\u201d. Perfect. \u201cNow why didn\u2019t I think of that?\u201d I thought to myself, jealously.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The only problem was, we discovered together later that same evening, that it doesn\u2019t much matter what you think you want to sing if someone else is controlling the karaoke machine. We\u2019d blundered into the same biker bar \u2013 \u201cthis place looks interesting\u201d \u2013 as half of the local rugby team, and their big winger, who\u2019d smacked the microphone down on the table in what felt less like an invitation and more like an order, wasn\u2019t impressed by my friend\u2019s suggestion. \u201cJohnnycash?\u201d he repeated back to us incredulously. He rolled it all into one word, which made it sound even more ludicrous. \u201cJohnnycash!\u201d his teammate, the No 8, repeated, and they both fell about laughing.</p> <p>It seemed to be one of the funniest things they\u2019d ever heard. The funniest, for sure, that either of us two Englishmen had said all night, even if we had no idea exactly what the joke was. The big winger bluntly insisted that we instead attempt I Want It That Way by the Backstreet Boys, and then I Don\u2019t Want To Miss A Thing by Aerosmith. We butchered them both, which was less amusing. They grinned awkwardly. \u201cSmiling not only indicates happiness,\u201d I noted later, looking in that World Rugby handbook, \u201cbut is also used to hide unpleasant emotions in public\u201d (p24).</p> <p>For the most part, though, the half a million rugby fans here all seem to be muddling along just fine. There haven\u2019t been any major scandals so far, at any rate. There was a small upset about the fact that ITV\u2019s pundits were wearing shoes on the tatami mats in their TV studio. And one English journalist ended up in the local papers because he wore his swimming trunks into the hot springs, and then got called out on it by Joe Marler in one of the England team\u2019s press conferences. \u201cApparently you lot have offended the Japanese culture,\u201d Marler said, with some glee. \u201cIt says specifically no shorts. I wore a vest to cover my tatts, and socks, but nothing here. Because I didn\u2019t want to offend them. And yet you\u2019re swanning about the place in swim shorts, it\u2019s ridiculous!\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/07/rugby-world-cup-pool-permutations\">Rugby World Cup pool permutations: who needs what in the last week?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There were some stories, too, about how upset some Japanese social media users have been by the way some fans are behaving on the trains to and from the ground. Best reassure them, then, that the England fans\u2019 chant of \u201cBilly! Billy Billy! Billy Vun-i-pola!\u201d to the tune of 2 Unlimited\u2019s No Limit loses its charm pretty fast, whatever country one happens to be in.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Some things you just can\u2019t learn from books. Even the 51-page guide to Japanese manners and customs the local organising committee distributed to visiting officials and journalists before this Rugby World Cup. It includes all sorts of hints and titbits like \u201cmake sure you don\u2019t have holes in your socks\u201d (page 19) and \u201cmany consider it impolite to sit with legs crossed and one foot pointing towards another person in the room\u201d (p24) and \u201cyou may be greeted with a handshake, or you may be greeted with a traditional Japanese bow, do not attempt to do both at the same time\u201d (p23). But \u2013 and I\u2019ve been through it three times now \u2013 it has nothing on the correct etiquette for handling the animals in one of Tokyo\u2019s new micropig cafes. Turns out that while you\u2019re very welcome to stroke and pat the micropigs scuttling around your feet, you should never try to pick them up because they are scared of heights. Like so many of the mistakes you can make in Japan, you\u2019ll figure out this one the very minute after you\u2019ve committed it, because the pig will squeal loudly. So, now you know. Be warned though, because, as Peter Carey writes in his book Wrong About Japan, after a particularly humiliating encounter in which he tried to impress an interviewee with his half-baked theories about manga, \u201chalf knowledge is sometimes much worse than complete ignorance\u201d. Knowing that it is rude to put your towel in the water at the public baths, for instance, only makes it that much more embarrassing when you accidentally do. And since the only spares are kept back by the front desk, there\u2019s no way out that won\u2019t leave you feeling awfully soggy and sheepish. So far, after nine matches in six cities, five of them in the space of just seven days, and three thousand-odd miles of air, road and rail travel, the World Cup has been a beginner\u2019s course in the all the many mistakes you can make while navigating your way around Japan. You might think that if you\u2019ve tackled the London rush hour on a regular basis you can cope with anything the Tokyo subway can throw at you in the morning. But the third time you get elbowed aside by the little old lady you were trying to let by you realise that this is an entirely different, and far more vicious proposition, one which only a lunatic would attempt while carrying a large backpack and suitcase. And you may know that it is essential to have a well thought-out karaoke strategy, that the classic English technique of getting hammered and singing badly isn\u2019t going to cut it after your host has just knocked out a near-note-perfect Sinatra number. Best, then, to consider your limitations while you\u2019re still sober and pick out a selection of well-known songs that you\u2019re quite sure fall within your vocal range. I was talking about exactly that with a colleague from another newspaper just the other night. He\u2019d been thinking about it and had settled on \u201csomething by Johnny Cash\u201d. Perfect. \u201cNow why didn\u2019t I think of that?\u201d I thought to myself, jealously. The only problem was, we discovered together later that same evening, that it doesn\u2019t much matter what you think you want to sing if someone else is controlling the karaoke machine. We\u2019d blundered into the same biker bar \u2013 \u201cthis place looks interesting\u201d \u2013 as half of the local rugby team, and their big winger, who\u2019d smacked the microphone down on the table in what felt less like an invitation and more like an order, wasn\u2019t impressed by my friend\u2019s suggestion. \u201cJohnnycash?\u201d he repeated back to us incredulously. He rolled it all into one word, which made it sound even more ludicrous. \u201cJohnnycash!\u201d his teammate, the No 8, repeated, and they both fell about laughing. It seemed to be one of the funniest things they\u2019d ever heard. The funniest, for sure, that either of us two Englishmen had said all night, even if we had no idea exactly what the joke was. The big winger bluntly insisted that we instead attempt I Want It That Way by the Backstreet Boys, and then I Don\u2019t Want To Miss A Thing by Aerosmith. We butchered them both, which was less amusing. They grinned awkwardly. \u201cSmiling not only indicates happiness,\u201d I noted later, looking in that World Rugby handbook, \u201cbut is also used to hide unpleasant emotions in public\u201d (p24). For the most part, though, the half a million rugby fans here all seem to be muddling along just fine. There haven\u2019t been any major scandals so far, at any rate. There was a small upset about the fact that ITV\u2019s pundits were wearing shoes on the tatami mats in their TV studio. And one English journalist ended up in the local papers because he wore his swimming trunks into the hot springs, and then got called out on it by Joe Marler in one of the England team\u2019s press conferences. \u201cApparently you lot have offended the Japanese culture,\u201d Marler said, with some glee. \u201cIt says specifically no shorts. I wore a vest to cover my tatts, and socks, but nothing here. Because I didn\u2019t want to offend them. And yet you\u2019re swanning about the place in swim shorts, it\u2019s ridiculous!\u201d There were some stories, too, about how upset some Japanese social media users have been by the way some fans are behaving on the trains to and from the ground. Best reassure them, then, that the England fans\u2019 chant of \u201cBilly! Billy Billy! Billy Vun-i-pola!\u201d to the tune of 2 Unlimited\u2019s No Limit loses its charm pretty fast, whatever country one happens to be in.",

Some 28 other banks have renewed a deal to offer this service \u2013 but Barclays is a refusenik. Its customers can use other services at post offices, but not the one that provokes most passion in the debate about banks\u2019 responsibilities to customers and society.</p> <p>The hardball policy probably did not reach the desk of its chief executive, Jes Staley, but the boss would be wise to pay attention now. Paying out fat bonuses to investment bankers while whacking the Post Office is a terrible look. If smaller rivals can bear the cost of offering a full service, so can Barclays. A U-turn is required \u2013 and quickly.</p> <h2>Lundgren\u2019s reticence reasonable amid Brexit uncertainty</h2> <p>Investors are still struggling to price Brexit risks. Shares in the recruitment companies PageGroup and Robert Walters <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/08/recruitment-firms-warn-brexit-and-china-trade-war-will-hit-profits\">slid on profits warnings</a> that should not have been seen as out-of-left-field developments. Business investment is weak and Brexit is a major factor. It was reasonable to assume that recruitment, notoriously sensitive to every twitch in the economy, was bound to be affected.</p> <p>Over at easyJet, where the shares fell 7.5%, the problem could be described as a Brexit vacuum. There was no issue with predicted numbers for the financial year that ended in September: at \u00a3420m-\u00a3430m, pre-tax profits will arrive marginally better than some forecasts, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/08/easyjet-ba-ryanair-strikes-profits\">thanks to help from strikes at Ryanair and British Airways</a>. Instead, the stock market took fright at a refusal by the chief executive, Johan Lundgren, to predict the airline\u2019s financial performance in 2020. All he would say was that forward bookings for the first quarter were \u201cin line with the same time last year\u201d.</p> <p>EasyJet bosses are traditionally more vocal at this point in the year but, in Lundgren\u2019s shoes, reticence is reasonable. There are too many Brexit variables. The biggest, in terms of potential to wreck profits, may be the risk of disruption and delay at airports. Since easyJet has no greater insight into that risk than anybody else, best to say nothing. Investors will have to get used to flying solo: companies can\u2019t read events outside their control.</p>",

Trying to justify the failed expedition, Charles Li, the chief executive of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX), cited a line he attributed to Lewis Carroll in a blogpost: \u201cWe only regret the chances we didn\u2019t take.\u201d He would have been closer to the mark if he had said his offer required the LSE\u2019s board and shareholders to imitate the White Queen and believe six impossible things before breakfast. The shortcomings in the proposal included: the mostly-shares structure; the need for about a year of regulatory scrutiny; the less-than-generous price; and the demand the LSE abandoned its popular (rightly or wrongly) $27bn (\u00a322bn) purchase of the data group Refinitiv. Then there were the obvious Hong Kong problems \u2013 street protests, with no end in sight, and the fact that half of the board of HKEX was appointed by a government that is prodded from Beijing. The fear of direct interference from China may explain why HKEX wanted to derisk its business but it was surely hopeless to think the LSE\u2019s board could be wooed with loose lines about capturing east-west capital flows. Since it is virtually impossible to complete the takeover of a major stock exchange without backing from the target\u2019s board, the proposal was always vulnerable to an instant rebuff. Li and HKEX declared themselves \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the outcome, but cannot be surprised. In the long list of failed bidders for the LSE, Hong Kong, in the current climate, was the least credible of the lot. U-turn needed over Barclays post office blunder It takes a lot to rouse the Payment Systems Regulator, one of our more obscure financial watchdogs, to anger, but Barclays has managed it. Indeed, the bank has needlessly annoyed a lot of people in one hit: Which?; Rachel Reeves, the chair of business select committee; and Martin Lewis, supposedly the most trusted man in Britain. Barclays\u2019 own goal was to scrap free over-the-counter cash withdrawals at post offices. Some 28 other banks have renewed a deal to offer this service \u2013 but Barclays is a refusenik. Its customers can use other services at post offices, but not the one that provokes most passion in the debate about banks\u2019 responsibilities to customers and society. The hardball policy probably did not reach the desk of its chief executive, Jes Staley, but the boss would be wise to pay attention now. Paying out fat bonuses to investment bankers while whacking the Post Office is a terrible look. If smaller rivals can bear the cost of offering a full service, so can Barclays. A U-turn is required \u2013 and quickly. Lundgren\u2019s reticence reasonable amid Brexit uncertainty Investors are still struggling to price Brexit risks. Shares in the recruitment companies PageGroup and Robert Walters slid on profits warnings that should not have been seen as out-of-left-field developments. Business investment is weak and Brexit is a major factor. It was reasonable to assume that recruitment, notoriously sensitive to every twitch in the economy, was bound to be affected. Over at easyJet, where the shares fell 7.5%, the problem could be described as a Brexit vacuum. There was no issue with predicted numbers for the financial year that ended in September: at \u00a3420m-\u00a3430m, pre-tax profits will arrive marginally better than some forecasts, thanks to help from strikes at Ryanair and British Airways. Instead, the stock market took fright at a refusal by the chief executive, Johan Lundgren, to predict the airline\u2019s financial performance in 2020. All he would say was that forward bookings for the first quarter were \u201cin line with the same time last year\u201d. EasyJet bosses are traditionally more vocal at this point in the year but, in Lundgren\u2019s shoes, reticence is reasonable. There are too many Brexit variables. The biggest, in terms of potential to wreck profits, may be the risk of disruption and delay at airports. Since easyJet has no greater insight into that risk than anybody else, best to say nothing. Investors will have to get used to flying solo: companies can\u2019t read events outside their control.",

      "bodyText": "A blockbuster exhibition of Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s works at the Louvre could be without one of his most famous works after an Italian court suspended its loan to the Paris museum following a last-minute legal challenge. Italia Nostra, a heritage group, argued that Leonardo\u2019s Vitruvian Man drawing, currently in Venice, was too fragile to be transported and risked being damaged by the lighting in the Louvre if displayed for a long period. The court\u2019s decision is the latest hurdle in a plan to bring together Leonardo\u2019s works in Paris to commemorate the 500th anniversary of the artist\u2019s death that first hit problems when Italy\u2019s former populist government \u2013 often at odds with Emmanuel Macron, the French president, on issues such as migration \u2013 threatened to block the initiative in its entirety. The exhibition is due to open on 24 October. Italia Nostra warned that because the Vitruvian Man could only be displayed for short periods at a time every six years, it risked having to be concealed for as long as a decade if shown at the Louvre because the drawing was already exhibited in Venice\u2019s Accademia galleries earlier this year. In filing its appeal to the court, the group referred to a law that bans the transportation of artworks beyond Italy that could be damaged in transit or by unfavourable conditions in the host museum. \u201cAll the technical reports have advised against the transfer of the very fragile design,\u201d Lidia Fersuoch, the president of the Venice unit of Italia Nostra, said in a statement on Monday. The court has scheduled a hearing on 16 October, during which the recently reappointed culture minister, Dario Franceschini, will put forward his arguments against the appeal. As a symbolic gesture, Franceschini and his French counterpart, Franck Riester, last month signed a memorandum of understanding in Paris that solidified agreements already made between Italian museums and the Louvre for the loan of seven Leonardo works. In return, France is lending Italy paintings by Raphael for events marking 500 years since his death next year. A spokesperson for Franceschini said several of the Leonardo works were already on their way to France. Franceschini began the negotiations when he previously served as culture minister under the centre-left Democratic party\u2019s government in 2017. But the plan hit a stumbling block when a coalition between the Five Star Movement (M5S) and the far-right League came to power in 2018. The then culture minister, M5S\u2019s Alberto Bonisoli, claimed the deal was unbalanced and his deputy, Lucia Borgonzoni, from the League, threatened to cancel the loan of Leonardo works last November. Accusing France of trying to take centre stage in the commemorations and sidelining Italy, she said: \u201cLeonardo is Italian; he only died in France.\u201d The M5S-League coalition collapsed in August, leading to the Democratic party\u2019s return to government in alliance with M5S.",

A no-deal Brexit would lead to a decline of the UK and a clear weakening of the roots of growth on the continent.\u201d</p> <p>Juncker said that Johnson\u2019s Brexit proposals would leave the UK with a relationship with the EU that was \u201cless intimate than with Canada\u201d. </p> <p>In Berlin Detlef Seif, the point person on Brexit for Merkel\u2019s party, the CDU, rejected the account given by Downing Street of the call between the two leaders.</p> <p>He said: \u201cIn my mind it is completely improbable that the phone call between Merkel and Johnson took place in the way it has been reported in the British media.</p> <p>\u201cIt would run counter to all the principles the German government has followed for the last three years, namely that the negotiations are led by the European commission.</p> <p>\u201cFor the German chancellor to insist on Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union would completely breach these guidelines.\u201d</p> <p>Germany has been one of the most outspoken advocates for allowing the UK as much flexibility as possible to avoid a no-deal scenario on 31 October or at a later date.</p> <p>The unnamed Downing Street briefings have been widely attributed to Dominic Cummings, the former Vote Leave supremo who is now the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser.</p> <p>\u201cThere has been a lot of scepticism about Johnson\u2019s proposal in Berlin, but Merkel\u2019s attitude has always been a positive one, to find out if there is room for a compromise,\u201d Sief said.</p> <p>\u201cThe only explanation I can see for these reports is that Johnson is trying to build a story where he blames Germany for a no-deal Brexit. To brief out a confidential phone call in such a manner is utterly unprofessional and infuriating to anyone who has been working on a deal\u201d.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Johnson spoke to the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, in a 40 minute call and agreed to meet later this week in what will be seen as a last-ditch chance to find a deal.</p> <p>The briefings attributed to Cummings had suggested that Varadkar had gone back on his word by attacking Johnson\u2019s proposals for the Irish border, which involve a customs border on the island of Ireland and Northern Ireland staying in the single market for goods.</p> <p>In Brussels, thinking is moving to how to react to what is seen as an inevitable request for an extension of the UK\u2019s EU membership.</p> <p>A debate among EU27 states over the end date for any extension is yet to take place.</p> <p>Following a meeting with Johnson in No 10 on Tuesday, the European parliament\u2019s president, David Sassoli, said there had been \u201cno progress\u201d in talks but MEPs were open to a Brexit extension.</p> <p>Johnson has repeatedly said that he will not comply with the Benn act, which would instruct him to request an extension by 19 October if a deal is not secured with the EU. He has also insisted that the UK will leave on 31 October with or without a deal.</p> <p>The unnamed source had suggested to the Spectator magazine on Monday night that the UK would be a truculent member, blocking the EU\u2019s plans.</p> <p>But the only key issue on which the UK could wield its veto would be the EU\u2019s seven-year budget which is unlikely to come to a vote until June, or September at the latest. \u201cWe could extend to September without any problem, but what would you achieve over the summer? So June seems more likely,\u201d said an EU diplomat.</p> <p>\u201cBeyond the UK being able to veto a budget, an end date by then is important because we don\u2019t want the UK to be in and net recipients to be able to argue that there is no reason for a cut to the budget.\u201d</p> <p>The Benn act suggests an extension until the end of January 2020 but there will be some concern in EU capitals that this will not provide sufficient time for any fallout from a general election to play out.</p>",

A no-deal Brexit would lead to a decline of the UK and a clear weakening of the roots of growth on the continent.\u201d Juncker said that Johnson\u2019s Brexit proposals would leave the UK with a relationship with the EU that was \u201cless intimate than with Canada\u201d. In Berlin Detlef Seif, the point person on Brexit for Merkel\u2019s party, the CDU, rejected the account given by Downing Street of the call between the two leaders. He said: \u201cIn my mind it is completely improbable that the phone call between Merkel and Johnson took place in the way it has been reported in the British media. \u201cIt would run counter to all the principles the German government has followed for the last three years, namely that the negotiations are led by the European commission. \u201cFor the German chancellor to insist on Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union would completely breach these guidelines.\u201d Germany has been one of the most outspoken advocates for allowing the UK as much flexibility as possible to avoid a no-deal scenario on 31 October or at a later date. The unnamed Downing Street briefings have been widely attributed to Dominic Cummings, the former Vote Leave supremo who is now the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser. \u201cThere has been a lot of scepticism about Johnson\u2019s proposal in Berlin, but Merkel\u2019s attitude has always been a positive one, to find out if there is room for a compromise,\u201d Sief said. \u201cThe only explanation I can see for these reports is that Johnson is trying to build a story where he blames Germany for a no-deal Brexit. To brief out a confidential phone call in such a manner is utterly unprofessional and infuriating to anyone who has been working on a deal\u201d. On Tuesday, Johnson spoke to the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, in a 40 minute call and agreed to meet later this week in what will be seen as a last-ditch chance to find a deal. The briefings attributed to Cummings had suggested that Varadkar had gone back on his word by attacking Johnson\u2019s proposals for the Irish border, which involve a customs border on the island of Ireland and Northern Ireland staying in the single market for goods. In Brussels, thinking is moving to how to react to what is seen as an inevitable request for an extension of the UK\u2019s EU membership. A debate among EU27 states over the end date for any extension is yet to take place. Following a meeting with Johnson in No 10 on Tuesday, the European parliament\u2019s president, David Sassoli, said there had been \u201cno progress\u201d in talks but MEPs were open to a Brexit extension. Johnson has repeatedly said that he will not comply with the Benn act, which would instruct him to request an extension by 19 October if a deal is not secured with the EU. He has also insisted that the UK will leave on 31 October with or without a deal. The unnamed source had suggested to the Spectator magazine on Monday night that the UK would be a truculent member, blocking the EU\u2019s plans. But the only key issue on which the UK could wield its veto would be the EU\u2019s seven-year budget which is unlikely to come to a vote until June, or September at the latest. \u201cWe could extend to September without any problem, but what would you achieve over the summer? So June seems more likely,\u201d said an EU diplomat. \u201cBeyond the UK being able to veto a budget, an end date by then is important because we don\u2019t want the UK to be in and net recipients to be able to argue that there is no reason for a cut to the budget.\u201d The Benn act suggests an extension until the end of January 2020 but there will be some concern in EU capitals that this will not provide sufficient time for any fallout from a general election to play out.",

      "body": "<p>European governments have been justifiably sceptical about Boris Johnson\u2019s approach to Brexit negotiations. After Tuesday\u2019s extraordinary developments, scepticism may have hardened into the certainty that they are dealing with a government willing to risk a no-deal future in order to win a general election. According to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/08/boris-johnson-ready-to-give-up-on-brexit-deal\" title=\"\">a briefing from a No 10 aide</a>, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, told the prime minister that \u201cthe UK cannot leave [the EU] without leaving Northern Ireland behind in a customs union and in full alignment for ever\u201d. The source added that this made a deal look impossible now and in the long term. Earlier, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/08/memo-from-no-10-contact-seen-as-fresh-play-in-blame-game-dominic-cummings\" title=\"\">another off-the-record steer</a> from Downing Street had suggested that if negotiations broke down, the Conservative party would fight an election on a no-deal ticket.</p> <p>In Berlin, a government spokesman refused to comment on the Merkel-Johnson phone call. In Brussels, officials said they did not recognise the comments attributed to Ms Merkel as EU policy. The European council president, Donald Tusk, was more forthright, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eucopresident/status/1181519363783974912\" title=\"\">tweeting directly</a> to the prime minister: \u201cWhat\u2019s at stake is not winning some stupid blame game.\u201d</p> <p>Whatever was actually said, this crunch week of negotiations has morphed into precisely that, because of Downing Street\u2019s decision to brief in such incendiary fashion. It will be hard to row back from here, as evidence mounts that a breakdown in negotiations is something Mr Johnson and his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, are ready to actively seek, as long as they can pin it on the perfidy of the EU. The truth is that the government probably still wants a deal, not least to avoid the chaotic and dangerous consequences that its own plan, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/11/operation-yellowhammer-fears-no-deal-brexit-chaos-forced-to-publish-secret-papers\" title=\"\">Operation Yellowhammer</a>, identified. But its \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/02/two-borders-four-years-what-boris-johnson-brexit-offer\" title=\"\">two borders for four years</a>\u201d plan \u2013 requiring single-market checks between Britain and Northern Ireland, and customs checks on the island of Ireland \u2013 is almost certainly not going to be the basis for one. As has been made clear from the outset of negotiations, the EU will not countenance the physical infrastructure that would necessarily accompany such checks in Ireland, creating a de facto border and undermining the Good Friday agreement.</p> <p>Given this reality, Mr Johnson may be refocusing on what has been his overwhelming priority all along: winning a general election. If negotiations break down, Mr Johnson is obliged by the Benn act to seek an extension to the 31 October deadline. In any subsequent election, he will need to convince furious leave voters that it wasn\u2019t his fault he failed to deliver. It may well serve this purpose for the meltdown to be as acrimonious as possible, with the EU, as well as parliament, in the dock. That would allow an election to be fought on a no-deal platform, neutralising the threat from Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party, in the expectation that the remain vote will stay split.</p> <p>On Tuesday night parliament was again prorogued \u2013 lawfully on this occasion \u2013 ahead of the Queen\u2019s speech next week. When it reconvenes on Monday, it will still be true that a majority in the House of Commons opposes no deal. It will still be true that a no-deal Brexit on 31 October is illegal. If talks on a deal do collapse this week, MPs must ensure that parliamentary sovereignty over the process is upheld. That is the first task. But given Tuesday\u2019s developments, which once again revealed this government\u2019s dangerous disregard for the national interest, that seems likely to be only the beginning of the battle to prevent no deal.</p>",

      "bodyText": "European governments have been justifiably sceptical about Boris Johnson\u2019s approach to Brexit negotiations. After Tuesday\u2019s extraordinary developments, scepticism may have hardened into the certainty that they are dealing with a government willing to risk a no-deal future in order to win a general election. According to a briefing from a No 10 aide, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, told the prime minister that \u201cthe UK cannot leave [the EU] without leaving Northern Ireland behind in a customs union and in full alignment for ever\u201d. The source added that this made a deal look impossible now and in the long term. Earlier, another off-the-record steer from Downing Street had suggested that if negotiations broke down, the Conservative party would fight an election on a no-deal ticket. In Berlin, a government spokesman refused to comment on the Merkel-Johnson phone call. In Brussels, officials said they did not recognise the comments attributed to Ms Merkel as EU policy. The European council president, Donald Tusk, was more forthright, tweeting directly to the prime minister: \u201cWhat\u2019s at stake is not winning some stupid blame game.\u201d Whatever was actually said, this crunch week of negotiations has morphed into precisely that, because of Downing Street\u2019s decision to brief in such incendiary fashion. It will be hard to row back from here, as evidence mounts that a breakdown in negotiations is something Mr Johnson and his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, are ready to actively seek, as long as they can pin it on the perfidy of the EU. The truth is that the government probably still wants a deal, not least to avoid the chaotic and dangerous consequences that its own plan, Operation Yellowhammer, identified. But its \u201ctwo borders for four years\u201d plan \u2013 requiring single-market checks between Britain and Northern Ireland, and customs checks on the island of Ireland \u2013 is almost certainly not going to be the basis for one. As has been made clear from the outset of negotiations, the EU will not countenance the physical infrastructure that would necessarily accompany such checks in Ireland, creating a de facto border and undermining the Good Friday agreement. Given this reality, Mr Johnson may be refocusing on what has been his overwhelming priority all along: winning a general election. If negotiations break down, Mr Johnson is obliged by the Benn act to seek an extension to the 31 October deadline. In any subsequent election, he will need to convince furious leave voters that it wasn\u2019t his fault he failed to deliver. It may well serve this purpose for the meltdown to be as acrimonious as possible, with the EU, as well as parliament, in the dock. That would allow an election to be fought on a no-deal platform, neutralising the threat from Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party, in the expectation that the remain vote will stay split. On Tuesday night parliament was again prorogued \u2013 lawfully on this occasion \u2013 ahead of the Queen\u2019s speech next week. When it reconvenes on Monday, it will still be true that a majority in the House of Commons opposes no deal. It will still be true that a no-deal Brexit on 31 October is illegal. If talks on a deal do collapse this week, MPs must ensure that parliamentary sovereignty over the process is upheld. That is the first task. But given Tuesday\u2019s developments, which once again revealed this government\u2019s dangerous disregard for the national interest, that seems likely to be only the beginning of the battle to prevent no deal.",

We\u2019re doing this for your children.\u201d By 6.30pm police had largely cleared the Whitehall camp, although several dozen people remained, locked together in tents or under tarpaulins refusing to move. The road was closed and even people unaffiliated with XR were refused access to Parliament Square. Police riot vans with lights flashing inched their way forward as the remaining protesters blocked the road. Before the camp was cleared, Hazel McGee, 76, said: \u201cAt the moment I\u2019m locked into an iron tube because I wish to stay in Whitehall. I\u2019m making a statement about the most important thing in the world now, which is that we start acting to prevent climate change, and in particular getting to tipping points where we can\u2019t turn back.\u201d McGee, a former editor of an astronomy journal, now retired, added: \u201cBoris Johnson and the current government are doing nothing. They are subsidising use of fossil fuels, subsidising the oil industry and preventing renewable energy becoming what it must be, which is the way of making civilisation work.\u201d She said she was planning to refuse to cooperate with police in the hope that her arrest would help to overwhelm their ability to deal with the protests. Lou Korda, 49, lying nearby with activists holding a tarpaulin over her to keep her dry, said she did not want to give up the Whitehall site. \u201cWe need to take action,\u201d she said. Dinah Taylor, 66, who was locked together with Korda, said: \u201cI\u2019ve been doing it all my life. All my voluntary work has been in conservation and in education about the environment, and it\u2019s got to the point that things are getting worse. The government is not listening to us and I\u2019ve got to use my body because there\u2019s nothing else I can do.\u201d Police tried to move in on protesters camping on Horseferry Road. Activists on the scene said it was still \u201cholding fast\u201d at about 5pm. The Metropolitan police said in a statement: \u201cAny assembly linked to the Extinction Rebellion \u2018autumn uprising\u2019 \u2026 who wish to continue with their assembly must go to Trafalgar Square and only assemble in the pedestrianised area around Trafalgar Column. The condition does not have a time limit.\u201d The force appears to have modified its use of the tactic. In April, orders were imposed on certain protest sites individually over the course of several days rather than across the city all at once. Officers were also not reading the order put individually to activists, instead shouting the order across crowds and telling people to consider themselves warned. At 5.30pm, the Met announced it had made 212 arrests, making a total of 531 over the two days of protest so far, it is understood. Earlier on Tuesday, Mike Schwarz, a solicitor at Bindmans, a law firm that specialises in protest cases, said the number of cases meant he and his colleagues were \u201creaching capacity and risk not providing a quality service\u201d. Even as they fought to keep hold of their central London protest sites, XR activists were beginning to prepare for their next phase of action, a sit-in protest at London City airport planned to last at least three days. In a statement circulated through social media, the group said: \u201cThe plan is to do a Hong Kong-style occupation of the terminal building, lying, sitting or gluing-on in front of the departure and arrivals gates. If we fail to get inside we\u2019ll blockade the space outside the doors. As this poses no risk to the airfield safety itself the action is non-violent, safe and open to everyone.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Alex Thomson has a new toy, and, judging by his Cheshire Cat grin, he likes it a lot. It is the latest in a line of boats called Hugo Boss, after the principal sponsor, and the one he hopes will finally deliver the prize he so craves.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.vendeeglobe.org/en/\">Vend\u00e9e Globe</a> single-handed round the world race is the toughest test in sailing. The course runs from Les Sables-d\u2019Olonne in Western France down the Atlantic, then clockwise around Antarctica, leaving the Cape of Good Hope, Cape Leeuwin and Cape Horn to port before returning to Les Sables-d\u2019Olonne.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/01/sailors-toyko-team-gb-olympics\">Sailors plot their course to Tokyo as Team GB names its first Olympians</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The next will be Thomson\u2019s fifth attempt; the first two he didn\u2019t finish, because of a holed deck and a cracked hull. In 2012-13 he came third. Last time out, 2016-17, he was runner up; he almost certainly would have won if it hadn\u2019t been for a broken foil, the curved blades that protrude from the hull and are revolutionising the sport by making boats pretty much fly. You can see why Thomson feels the next Vend\u00e9e Globe, which starts in November next year, belongs to him. No non-French sailor has ever won.</p> <p>The early signs from the new boat are good. You\u2019d hope so, given the numbers: 30,000 man-hours in design, 50,000 in the build, over 100 people involved, at a cost of \u00a35.5m. It (I\u2019m finding it hard to call a boat named Hugo Boss she) looks like how you might imagine Batman\u2019s to look like; all black, apart from a shocking pink coachroof, keel and rudders. The huge curved foils have pointy fin-shaped ends, so that when they\u2019re working and the leeward one is party submerged, it looks as if the boat has its own accompanying outrider shark. Well weapon, Nathan Barley might say.</p> <p>We\u2019ve come out from Portsmouth harbour into the Solent, which is grey and flat, and we\u2019re scorching along. In 19 knots of wind we\u2019re hitting 30, 31, over 32 knots. Sixty kilometres an hour. Spray is flying over the deck. The old adage about sailing being like sitting under a cold shower ripping up ten pound notes needs updating for this \u2013 standing in front of water cannon throwing bitcoins down the drain?</p> <p>No wonder Thomson, gripping on to the tiller with both hands, is smiling. As well as shouting into his headset: \u201cmore on the jib \u2026 tighten the vang \u2026 what\u2019s the angle of attack \u2026 are we going to miss that ferry?\u201d Today he has help, three crew members (in total there are 25 on the team, including designers, sailors, systems and software engineers, PR and Marketing). The three crew are down below, grinding and trimming, canting the keel, changing the angle of the foils. I\u2019m finding it hard to imagine how it\u2019s possible to do all this alone, for 70 days.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ef2477e72df92b9b3b9862156eacb85227a620cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef2477e72df92b9b3b9862156eacb85227a620cf/0_0_5137_3425/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alex Thomson onboard the 2019 Hugo Boss.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alex Thomson onboard the 2019 Hugo Boss.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Snook/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Our interview has to wait until we\u2019re safely tied up back in Gosport. This is an exciting time to be involved in sailing, says Thomson, particularly with the development of foils. \u201cWho would have thought 15 years ago that we would be doing 32 knots in 19 knots of wind? What happens in the next five years?\u201d</p> <p>And yet the sport doesn\u2019t get the attention in Britain as it does in just over there on the other side of the Channel. Almost everyoneknows of the Vend\u00e9e Globe in France, school children follow it, and sailors are sporting heroes. \u201cThey genuinely understand it, and what we have to go through,\u201d says Thomson.</p> <p>Sailing still has an elitist reputation in Britain. \u201cThat comes from the old days,\u201d he says. You don\u2019t have to spend \u00a35.5m to get on the water. \u201cGo to any sailing club in the country, you\u2019ll see Crew Wanted notices on the board. You can sail for nothing, I don\u2019t think people realise that. In France they believe \u2013 this is the fundamental difference \u2013 that if you take a kid and put them in a single-handed boat you\u2019re going to teach them independence, if you put them in a double-handed boat you\u2019re going to teach them teamwork and communication. They believe sailing teaches life skills, we don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Forty-five year old Thomson is probably better known in France than he is in his own country.Recently in France he was stopped at the lights and a workman in high-vis \u201cturned around, looked me in the eye, and said: [adopts comedy French accent] ah, you Alex Thomson\u2019. That would never happen in England.\u201d</p> <p>They must hate him over there, the imposter in their race? \u201cLe Rosbif,\u201d he laughs. \u201cOver the years they have definitely warmed to me. They are respectful, I think they are worried about us.\u201d</p> <p>Not like Chris Froome getting booed in the Tour de France then? Not at all, says Thomson, he will be cheered by the huge crowds that gather when he sets out from Les Sables-d\u2019Olonne next year. Actually they want a non-French sailor to win. \u201cThey need that for the race to be properly internationalised \u2026 we are the only non-French team, with the budget and the experience, that could win.\u201d</p> <p>Will they win? \u201cYes,\u201d he says, before adding \u201cmaybe\u201d. There are always factors outside their control, things in the water that can be hit. But they\u2019re throwing everything \u2013 time, effort, experience, a whole load of Hugo Boss\u2019s cash \u2013 at it.</p> <p>We\u2019re now sitting, relatively peacefully, in the cabin. Though cabin suggests a certain amount of comfort and cosiness, and there\u2019s very little of either on Hugo Boss. It\u2019s all ropes, and cables, winches, screens, fibre optics, coms, cameras, sensors, tech. This kind of sailing is as much about analysing data and writing code as it is about tying knots. Radically, they\u2019ve moved the cockpit from outside at the back to down here, in order to make it less exposed and safer for him.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/09/british-woman-jeanne-socrates-oldest-person-sail-around-world-alone\">British woman, 77, becomes oldest person to sail around the world alone</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But they seem to have forgotten that it will also be his home for over two months. Where does he cook? (I was sort of hoping for a warming cup of tea). He points to a tiny single-ring portable camping gas cooker, to boil the desalinated seawater he hydrates his freeze-dried food with, but the canister is empty.</p> <p>And somewhere to sleep, a berth? They haven\u2019t quite figured out where that\u2019s going yet, though sleep \u2013 or lack of it \u2013 is one of the biggest challenges for the single-handed round-the-world sailor. \u201cI\u2019m not the typical introverted single-handed sailor, I wear my heart on my sleeve. My problem is if I am doing badly I work harder, forego sleep, all my disciplines go out of the window, that\u2019s not good.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4cd2a4a87632aa60a41c4716cd69fae987d3a042\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4cd2a4a87632aa60a41c4716cd69fae987d3a042/0_0_5115_3148/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thomson helms the Hugo Boss IMOCA 60 during a training session.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"615\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomson helms the Hugo Boss IMOCA 60 during a training session.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Snook/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In last year\u2019s Route du Rhum transatlantic race Thomson, leading just a few miles from the finish, decided to grab a few minutes sleep, failed to wake up when the alarm went off and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/sailing/46238013\">crashed into Guadeloupe</a>. Now he works with a sports psychologist (Ken Way who was with Leicester City when they won the Premier League in 2016) on managing emotions and eradicating complacency. One of the things Way has taught him to do, in order to feel better, is to smile. But I think the big grin earlier, when he was driving his new boat really, really fast was more than a coping strategy, I think it was the real deal.</p>",

The course runs from Les Sables-d\u2019Olonne in Western France down the Atlantic, then clockwise around Antarctica, leaving the Cape of Good Hope, Cape Leeuwin and Cape Horn to port before returning to Les Sables-d\u2019Olonne. The next will be Thomson\u2019s fifth attempt; the first two he didn\u2019t finish, because of a holed deck and a cracked hull. In 2012-13 he came third. Last time out, 2016-17, he was runner up; he almost certainly would have won if it hadn\u2019t been for a broken foil, the curved blades that protrude from the hull and are revolutionising the sport by making boats pretty much fly. You can see why Thomson feels the next Vend\u00e9e Globe, which starts in November next year, belongs to him. No non-French sailor has ever won. The early signs from the new boat are good. You\u2019d hope so, given the numbers: 30,000 man-hours in design, 50,000 in the build, over 100 people involved, at a cost of \u00a35.5m. It (I\u2019m finding it hard to call a boat named Hugo Boss she) looks like how you might imagine Batman\u2019s to look like; all black, apart from a shocking pink coachroof, keel and rudders. The huge curved foils have pointy fin-shaped ends, so that when they\u2019re working and the leeward one is party submerged, it looks as if the boat has its own accompanying outrider shark. Well weapon, Nathan Barley might say. We\u2019ve come out from Portsmouth harbour into the Solent, which is grey and flat, and we\u2019re scorching along. In 19 knots of wind we\u2019re hitting 30, 31, over 32 knots. Sixty kilometres an hour. Spray is flying over the deck. The old adage about sailing being like sitting under a cold shower ripping up ten pound notes needs updating for this \u2013 standing in front of water cannon throwing bitcoins down the drain? No wonder Thomson, gripping on to the tiller with both hands, is smiling. As well as shouting into his headset: \u201cmore on the jib \u2026 tighten the vang \u2026 what\u2019s the angle of attack \u2026 are we going to miss that ferry?\u201d Today he has help, three crew members (in total there are 25 on the team, including designers, sailors, systems and software engineers, PR and Marketing). The three crew are down below, grinding and trimming, canting the keel, changing the angle of the foils. I\u2019m finding it hard to imagine how it\u2019s possible to do all this alone, for 70 days. Our interview has to wait until we\u2019re safely tied up back in Gosport. This is an exciting time to be involved in sailing, says Thomson, particularly with the development of foils. \u201cWho would have thought 15 years ago that we would be doing 32 knots in 19 knots of wind? What happens in the next five years?\u201d And yet the sport doesn\u2019t get the attention in Britain as it does in just over there on the other side of the Channel. Almost everyoneknows of the Vend\u00e9e Globe in France, school children follow it, and sailors are sporting heroes. \u201cThey genuinely understand it, and what we have to go through,\u201d says Thomson. Sailing still has an elitist reputation in Britain. \u201cThat comes from the old days,\u201d he says. You don\u2019t have to spend \u00a35.5m to get on the water. \u201cGo to any sailing club in the country, you\u2019ll see Crew Wanted notices on the board. You can sail for nothing, I don\u2019t think people realise that. In France they believe \u2013 this is the fundamental difference \u2013 that if you take a kid and put them in a single-handed boat you\u2019re going to teach them independence, if you put them in a double-handed boat you\u2019re going to teach them teamwork and communication. They believe sailing teaches life skills, we don\u2019t.\u201d Forty-five year old Thomson is probably better known in France than he is in his own country.Recently in France he was stopped at the lights and a workman in high-vis \u201cturned around, looked me in the eye, and said: [adopts comedy French accent] ah, you Alex Thomson\u2019. That would never happen in England.\u201d They must hate him over there, the imposter in their race? \u201cLe Rosbif,\u201d he laughs. \u201cOver the years they have definitely warmed to me. They are respectful, I think they are worried about us.\u201d Not like Chris Froome getting booed in the Tour de France then? Not at all, says Thomson, he will be cheered by the huge crowds that gather when he sets out from Les Sables-d\u2019Olonne next year. Actually they want a non-French sailor to win. \u201cThey need that for the race to be properly internationalised \u2026 we are the only non-French team, with the budget and the experience, that could win.\u201d Will they win? \u201cYes,\u201d he says, before adding \u201cmaybe\u201d. There are always factors outside their control, things in the water that can be hit. But they\u2019re throwing everything \u2013 time, effort, experience, a whole load of Hugo Boss\u2019s cash \u2013 at it. We\u2019re now sitting, relatively peacefully, in the cabin. Though cabin suggests a certain amount of comfort and cosiness, and there\u2019s very little of either on Hugo Boss. It\u2019s all ropes, and cables, winches, screens, fibre optics, coms, cameras, sensors, tech. This kind of sailing is as much about analysing data and writing code as it is about tying knots. Radically, they\u2019ve moved the cockpit from outside at the back to down here, in order to make it less exposed and safer for him. But they seem to have forgotten that it will also be his home for over two months. Where does he cook? (I was sort of hoping for a warming cup of tea). He points to a tiny single-ring portable camping gas cooker, to boil the desalinated seawater he hydrates his freeze-dried food with, but the canister is empty. And somewhere to sleep, a berth? They haven\u2019t quite figured out where that\u2019s going yet, though sleep \u2013 or lack of it \u2013 is one of the biggest challenges for the single-handed round-the-world sailor. \u201cI\u2019m not the typical introverted single-handed sailor, I wear my heart on my sleeve. My problem is if I am doing badly I work harder, forego sleep, all my disciplines go out of the window, that\u2019s not good.\u201d In last year\u2019s Route du Rhum transatlantic race Thomson, leading just a few miles from the finish, decided to grab a few minutes sleep, failed to wake up when the alarm went off and crashed into Guadeloupe. Now he works with a sports psychologist (Ken Way who was with Leicester City when they won the Premier League in 2016) on managing emotions and eradicating complacency. One of the things Way has taught him to do, in order to feel better, is to smile. But I think the big grin earlier, when he was driving his new boat really, really fast was more than a coping strategy, I think it was the real deal.",

It said voter confidence in the election was lower than in any other recent polls, denting the democratic contract with the public. Research conducted by the commission found that confidence that the European elections were well run was more than 10 percentage points below that in the previous European elections in 2014. Confidence in the running of local elections, which took place on the same day in some areas, was down 12 percentage points Thousands of EU citizens on the voter register were turned away from polling booths in May because they had not been made aware they had to fill in a separate form declaring that they were exercising their vote in the UK. Many others who were aware they needed to fill in the form said they were not able to complete it or did not receive the notification on time to be counted. There were also multiple complaints from Britons in Europe who had the right to vote but did not receive their ballot papers in sufficient time to return them by polling day. The government is now being challenged in the courts by campaigners for the rights of EU citizens.",

      "bodyText": "The governor of the Bank of England has warned major corporations that they have two years to agree rules for reporting climate risks before global regulators devise their own and make them compulsory. Mark Carney said companies should use their next two annual financial reports to road test how they document the impact of the climate emergency on their businesses. He said progress had been made by many of the largest banks and energy companies to harmonise how they report their risks, but added: \u201cProgress in both quantity and quality is uneven across sectors.\u201d Speaking in Tokyo at a conference held by the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), Carney said there was an appetite among investors to support companies that understand their climate risks following research that showed they were likely to expand at a faster rate. \u201cThe TCFD needs to reach a definitive view of what counts as a high quality disclosure before they become mandatory. In my view the next two reporting periods should balance the urgency of the task and the imperative of getting it right,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is best delivered by the current process of disclosure by the users of capital, reaction by the suppliers of capital, and adjustment of these standards to ensure that the TCFD metrics are as comparable, efficient and as decision-useful as possible.\u201d Carney launched the TCFD in 2015 with Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire owner of the financial data provider that carries his name. Bloomberg took on the role as founder and head of the organisation, tapping his vast contact list of chief executives and financiers to convince them that reporting the impact of their businesses on the environment and the way they would be affected by rising temperatures was a precondition of tackling the climate emergency. The former New York mayor has signed up a range of banks, asset managers, pension funds and insurers that control balance sheets totalling $120tn (\u00a398tn) to the project. He says four-fifths of the top 1,100 companies operating from the G20 countries are disclosing climate-related financial risks in line with some of the TCFD recommendations. The aim is to develop a series of rules governing how companies report the effect of warming temperatures on their businesses alongside data showing the contribution of their activities to the problem. With trillions of dollars needed to build climate-friendly infrastructure, investors needed to know which companies to back and which to shun, Carney said. Some companies have discovered that their activities would contribute to the planet warming by 3C or more, breaching the Paris climate agreement limit. Carney said: \u201cConsistent with the Paris accord\u2019s objective to stabilise temperature increases to below two degrees, many governments are now committing to reaching net zero carbon by 2050.\u201d He said: \u201cIn convening this summit, Prime Minister [Shinzo] Abe [of Japan] has rightly highlighted the enormous investments that will be necessary to deliver these objectives. \u201cWith an estimated $90tn of infrastructure spending expected between 2015 and 2030, the right decisions now can make sure those investments are both financially rewarding and environmentally sustainable.\u201d Carney said the popularity of the TCFD initiative meant three-quarters of investors were using its disclosure rules before buying company shares. In the summer Carney said the Bank of England planned to stress-test banks for catastrophic climate-linked financial risks as part of its annual health check of the banking system in 2021. It said it would look at the risks facing UK banks from a dramatic rise in global temperatures and mounting natural disasters, as well as a separate scenario where governments introduce new rules to limit the burning of fossil fuels.",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s been about 25 years since Michael Gove last took drugs. Give or take. But during his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/08/uk-prepared-for-no-deal-brexit-but-some-risks-remain-says-gove\">Commons statement</a> on no-deal preparations, the de facto deputy prime minister gave a good impression of someone back on cocaine. Maybe he was just enjoying euphoric recall, but this was Gove at his most insufferable. Which is saying something. Twitchy, arrogant and dismissive. Convinced of his own divinity. And deadly boring with it.</p> <p>Gove has often had something of a charmed life in parliament. Everyone has always known he has an uneasy relationship with the truth \u2013 no one who has employed Dominic Cummings as a special adviser can ever have been said to be on the side of the angels \u2013 but he has always enjoyed the benefit of the doubt because of his ability to sound unfailingly polite when he is in fact being point blank rude. Now though, that facade has dropped. His soul has been sold several times over and all that is left is bluster and bullshit.</p> <p>The day won\u2019t be remembered as one of Westminster\u2019s finest. Overnight, a government adviser \u2013 step forward Classic Dom \u2013 had leaked that the Brexit negotiations were dead in the water, we were heading for no deal and the UK would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/08/no-10-memo-dominic-cummings-threatening-eu-states-over-brexit-extension-is-shaming\">seek to punish</a> any EU country that granted an article 50 extension.</p> <p>Then another No 10 spokesman leaked a sketchy version of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/08/boris-johnson-ready-to-give-up-on-brexit-deal\">phone call</a> between Boris Johnson and Angela Merkel in which all the blame for the failure of negotiations was attributed to the German refusal to compromise. Government by unattributable quotes, with all eyes firmly focused on an imminent election rather than a Brexit deal.</p> <p>Gove\u2019s performance did nothing to raise the tone. Among the charlatans in the cabinet, Mikey is right up there. Since the referendum campaign, lying has become second nature to him. His only embarrassment is when someone happens to catch him out telling the truth. So he lied about how he was still hoping for a deal to be reached, despite knowing full well that insisting Northern Ireland leave the customs union would create some kind of hard border.</p> <p>Then things took a rather darker turn. Earlier this year, Boris Johnson had declared that a no-deal Brexit was a million-to-one shot.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s been about 25 years since Michael Gove last took drugs. Give or take. But during his Commons statement on no-deal preparations, the de facto deputy prime minister gave a good impression of someone back on cocaine. Maybe he was just enjoying euphoric recall, but this was Gove at his most insufferable. Which is saying something. Twitchy, arrogant and dismissive. Convinced of his own divinity. And deadly boring with it. Gove has often had something of a charmed life in parliament. Everyone has always known he has an uneasy relationship with the truth \u2013 no one who has employed Dominic Cummings as a special adviser can ever have been said to be on the side of the angels \u2013 but he has always enjoyed the benefit of the doubt because of his ability to sound unfailingly polite when he is in fact being point blank rude. Now though, that facade has dropped. His soul has been sold several times over and all that is left is bluster and bullshit. The day won\u2019t be remembered as one of Westminster\u2019s finest. Overnight, a government adviser \u2013 step forward Classic Dom \u2013 had leaked that the Brexit negotiations were dead in the water, we were heading for no deal and the UK would seek to punish any EU country that granted an article 50 extension. Then another No 10 spokesman leaked a sketchy version of a phone call between Boris Johnson and Angela Merkel in which all the blame for the failure of negotiations was attributed to the German refusal to compromise. Government by unattributable quotes, with all eyes firmly focused on an imminent election rather than a Brexit deal. Gove\u2019s performance did nothing to raise the tone. Among the charlatans in the cabinet, Mikey is right up there. Since the referendum campaign, lying has become second nature to him. His only embarrassment is when someone happens to catch him out telling the truth. So he lied about how he was still hoping for a deal to be reached, despite knowing full well that insisting Northern Ireland leave the customs union would create some kind of hard border. Then things took a rather darker turn. Earlier this year, Boris Johnson had declared that a no-deal Brexit was a million-to-one shot. Well, how lucky must the prime minister be feeling now his rank outsider was just about the only runner left standing? Gove affected no surprise at the rapid change of odds. In just a couple of months, he, the Great Mikey, had made sure the country was entirely prepared for no deal. Babble, babble, sweaty babble. Gove went off on one. Everything was tickety boo. People would be drinking gallons of cheap South American wine, the UK would become a world centre for the narcotics trade, anyone who was made homeless would be entitled to a free cardboard box and the government was putting \u00a35m towards ensuring each town had its own Dignitas drop-in centre. It was that deranged. A fantasy vision of the UK that wouldn\u2019t survive even passing contact with reality.

      "body": "<p>A new unofficial Bernie Sanders ad, made by a fan, <a href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/10/04/gave-me-goosebumps-praise-independent-video-captures-side-bernie-sanders-corporate\">is making</a> a lot of viewers tear up. It contrasts dismissive and disparaging comments about Bernie from TV pundits with the warmth felt towards him by his supporters across the country. It movingly shows how Sanders inspires people and gives them hope \u2013 but also just how insulated the \u201cpundit class\u201d is from the reality of people\u2019s lives.</p> <p>In the video, commentators from CNN and MSNBC talk about Sanders as a man \u201cyelling at people in the same screechy voice, without smiling, without any kind of personal connection\u201d. He \u201cdoesn\u2019t actually smile that much\u201d, they complain. Meanwhile, on the campaign trail, thousands of people feel a strong connection to Bernie, because he\u2019s talking about the issues that matter to them: healthcare, student debt, climate change, working conditions. And he smiles quite a bit.</p> <p>The media not only treat Sanders as a humorless fringe demagogue, but they also understate his popularity. Katie Halper <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2019/08/msnbc-poll-bernie-sanders-presidential-campaign\">has documented</a> the various ways in which media organizations have subtly fudged the numbers to make Bernie seem less successful than he is, and there is still a narrative that his campaign is failing even as it hauls in <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/bernie-sanders-raises-massive-dollar253-million-in-third-quarter\">giant quantities of small donations</a> from <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/02/us/politics/2020-democratic-fundraising.html\">all over the country</a>. Even as he shatters fundraising records there will be <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/revolution-stalled-bernie-sanders-struggles-against-a-double-bind/2019/05/29/e6d5acce-8179-11e9-95a9-e2c830afe24f_story.html\">stories</a> of him \u201cstruggling to attract new supporters, and even keep some of the old ones\u201d.</p> <p>In part, the media underestimates Bernie because it can\u2019t understand Bernie. The new ad quotes CNN\u2019s Nia-Malika Henderson saying it\u2019s \u201creally hard to imagine who the Bernie Sanders voter is at this point\u201d. And it\u2019s true: if you are, like Henderson, a Yale graduate living in Washington DC, or you are, like the New York Times\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2019/07/bernie-sanders-sydney-ember-new-york-times\">Sydney Ember</a>, a former financial analyst for an investment bank, the source of Bernie\u2019s appeal must be mystifying. That\u2019s because Sanders returns again and again to issues that are of little interest to the political media, like environmental policy, social welfare, and education.</p> <p>Consider MSNBC. Combing through their home page a few days ago, I found that <a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/2019/10/keeping-our-eyes-on-the-ball\">nearly every story was about</a> Trump, Ukraine and impeachment. The one headline about climate change, an issue so important that it should be dominating every day\u2019s deadlines, was \u201cWatch London climate change protest involving 1,800 liters of fake blood go horribly wrong,\u201d hardly a substantive discussion of science or policy.</p> <p>In a recent New York Times<em> </em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/01/magazine/rachel-maddow-trump.html\">profile</a>, Rachel Maddow was quite open about her show being dominated by stories about Russia and Trump: \u201cI\u2019m happy to admit that I\u2019m obsessed with Russia. I realize it\u2019s controversial, and people give me a lot of grief for focusing on it. But I make no apologies.\u201d</p> <p>Maddow even says that she has borrowed broadcasting techniques from Roger Ailes, the alleged sexual predator who turned Fox News into a brain-numbing hate factory. This is the kind of television MSNBC aspires to: a leftwing version of Fox News, meaning a lot of drama and excitement but very little relevance to the real issues affecting people\u2019s lives.</p> <p>If you see MSNBC as \u201cthe left\u201d and Fox as \u201cthe right\u201d, then Bernie Sanders must be some strange aberration that doesn\u2019t make sense. In fact, he\u2019s just a person with a well-refined sense of what matters and what doesn\u2019t. Sanders <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/27/bernie-sanders-attacks-media-press-fair-or-trump-2020-democrats\">has been accused of</a> mirroring Donald Trump in his scathing attacks on the media. But while Trump\u2019s objection to the media is that they spend too much time exposing his crimes and lies, Sanders\u2019 objection is that they don\u2019t elevate the voices of ordinary people and they don\u2019t inform the public about the most important issues.</p> <p>As he writes in his book Our Revolution<em>:</em></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>For years, major crises like climate change, the impact of trade agreements on our economy, the role of big money in politics, and youth unemployment have received scant media coverage. Trade union leaders, environmentalists, low-income activists, people prepared to challenge the corporate ideology, rarely appear on our TV screens \u2026 [A]s a general rule of thumb, the more important the issue is to large numbers of working people, the less interesting it is to corporate media.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>It is very hard for any honest person to deny that this is true. Maddow essentially admits it. What she cares about is the story about Trump and Russia. Climate scientists? Union leaders? They\u2019re probably ratings poison. The impeachment story is the kind of scandal that makes for great television.</p> <p>But how much do ordinary people really care?

      "bodyText": "A new unofficial Bernie Sanders ad, made by a fan, is making a lot of viewers tear up. It contrasts dismissive and disparaging comments about Bernie from TV pundits with the warmth felt towards him by his supporters across the country. It movingly shows how Sanders inspires people and gives them hope \u2013 but also just how insulated the \u201cpundit class\u201d is from the reality of people\u2019s lives. In the video, commentators from CNN and MSNBC talk about Sanders as a man \u201cyelling at people in the same screechy voice, without smiling, without any kind of personal connection\u201d. He \u201cdoesn\u2019t actually smile that much\u201d, they complain. Meanwhile, on the campaign trail, thousands of people feel a strong connection to Bernie, because he\u2019s talking about the issues that matter to them: healthcare, student debt, climate change, working conditions. And he smiles quite a bit. The media not only treat Sanders as a humorless fringe demagogue, but they also understate his popularity. Katie Halper has documented the various ways in which media organizations have subtly fudged the numbers to make Bernie seem less successful than he is, and there is still a narrative that his campaign is failing even as it hauls in giant quantities of small donations from all over the country. Even as he shatters fundraising records there will be stories of him \u201cstruggling to attract new supporters, and even keep some of the old ones\u201d. In part, the media underestimates Bernie because it can\u2019t understand Bernie. The new ad quotes CNN\u2019s Nia-Malika Henderson saying it\u2019s \u201creally hard to imagine who the Bernie Sanders voter is at this point\u201d. And it\u2019s true: if you are, like Henderson, a Yale graduate living in Washington DC, or you are, like the New York Times\u2019 Sydney Ember, a former financial analyst for an investment bank, the source of Bernie\u2019s appeal must be mystifying. That\u2019s because Sanders returns again and again to issues that are of little interest to the political media, like environmental policy, social welfare, and education. Consider MSNBC. Combing through their home page a few days ago, I found that nearly every story was about Trump, Ukraine and impeachment. The one headline about climate change, an issue so important that it should be dominating every day\u2019s deadlines, was \u201cWatch London climate change protest involving 1,800 liters of fake blood go horribly wrong,\u201d hardly a substantive discussion of science or policy. In a recent New York Times profile, Rachel Maddow was quite open about her show being dominated by stories about Russia and Trump: \u201cI\u2019m happy to admit that I\u2019m obsessed with Russia. I realize it\u2019s controversial, and people give me a lot of grief for focusing on it. But I make no apologies.\u201d Maddow even says that she has borrowed broadcasting techniques from Roger Ailes, the alleged sexual predator who turned Fox News into a brain-numbing hate factory. This is the kind of television MSNBC aspires to: a leftwing version of Fox News, meaning a lot of drama and excitement but very little relevance to the real issues affecting people\u2019s lives. If you see MSNBC as \u201cthe left\u201d and Fox as \u201cthe right\u201d, then Bernie Sanders must be some strange aberration that doesn\u2019t make sense. In fact, he\u2019s just a person with a well-refined sense of what matters and what doesn\u2019t. Sanders has been accused of mirroring Donald Trump in his scathing attacks on the media. But while Trump\u2019s objection to the media is that they spend too much time exposing his crimes and lies, Sanders\u2019 objection is that they don\u2019t elevate the voices of ordinary people and they don\u2019t inform the public about the most important issues. As he writes in his book Our Revolution: For years, major crises like climate change, the impact of trade agreements on our economy, the role of big money in politics, and youth unemployment have received scant media coverage. Trade union leaders, environmentalists, low-income activists, people prepared to challenge the corporate ideology, rarely appear on our TV screens \u2026 [A]s a general rule of thumb, the more important the issue is to large numbers of working people, the less interesting it is to corporate media. It is very hard for any honest person to deny that this is true. Maddow essentially admits it. What she cares about is the story about Trump and Russia. Climate scientists? Union leaders? They\u2019re probably ratings poison. The impeachment story is the kind of scandal that makes for great television. But how much do ordinary people really care? What Trump said to the president of Ukraine matters, but it doesn\u2019t matter so much that it dwarfs climate change and child poverty. As Maximilian Alvarez shows in a thorough new essay for the Nation, the media systematically ignores the voices of actual working-class people, and shows almost no interest in their concerns. (Alvarez, on the other hand, lets workers speak in their own voices on his excellent podcast Working People.) The reason the media doesn\u2019t understand Sanders, then, is in part that they do not understand the problems he is speaking about or why they matter. To cover him fairly would require them to re-examine their entire values and priorities. And that wouldn\u2019t be good for ratings.

Western United With the arrival of Western Sydney Wanderers in 2012-13, the infant A-League noticeably lifted. Yes, there had been active support, but not like this. Yes, there had been derbies, but not like this. And yes, there had been marquees \u2013 but not like this. The Wanderers sparked an arms race \u2013 Sydney FC shifted uncomfortably, in came Alessandro Del Piero. Fast-forward to 2019 and a club that should be flying, Melbourne City, has been drifting. No clear identity, no connection to fans.

(JP) Exciting youngsters It\u2019s been an aching sore point in the A-League for years: despite the hype around young potentials like Ramy Najjarine or Dylan Pierias, limited league minutes have stymied the development of Australia\u2019s best young talents. Now, while the precise detail is still to be confirmed, Congress is making noises of larger bench sizes, possibly even spots being ear-marked for players under the age of 23. More than that, clubs like Sydney FC \u2013 infamously geared towards experienced journeymen \u2013 are starting to show faith in their academies.

We gave a bad performance and for some reason we could not play as we had done before that game.\u201d A lack of experience playing on such a big stage may have played a part. \u201cWe might have been nervous, it was very hot and so on \u2013 you can always look for excuses if you want to.\u201d</p> <p>But there are excuses for a team ranked 161 in the world as they prepare to face a host ranked 117 places higher and with facilities, support and resources that Nepal can only dream of.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/10/socceroos-hit-road-to-qatar-with-invitation-for-next-generation-to-step-up\">Socceroos hit road to Qatar with invitation for next generation to step up | Richard Parkin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere are of course challenges as a coach. One is a lack of pitches and we have pretty much only one pitch we can use in Kathmandu. That pitch we are sharing with the women\u2019s team, youth teams, school tournaments and so on.

Two more goals deep into injury time made a bad day look terrible. \u201cI still can\u2019t explain the game against Kuwait in a good way,\u201d Kalin told Guardian Australia. \u201cI did not see that coming and I am still very surprised with the way we conceded goals and chances. We gave a bad performance and for some reason we could not play as we had done before that game.\u201d A lack of experience playing on such a big stage may have played a part. \u201cWe might have been nervous, it was very hot and so on \u2013 you can always look for excuses if you want to.\u201d But there are excuses for a team ranked 161 in the world as they prepare to face a host ranked 117 places higher and with facilities, support and resources that Nepal can only dream of. \u201cThere are of course challenges as a coach. One is a lack of pitches and we have pretty much only one pitch we can use in Kathmandu. That pitch we are sharing with the women\u2019s team, youth teams, school tournaments and so on. That means that we have had to cancel a lot of sessions because we have not had a pitch to use.\u201d The devastating earthquake of April 2015 also affected football. \u201cLast year the league started again after four or five years without a league.\u201d It has restarted but it makes the A-League seem like a marathon. \u201cThe league is very short and lasts only two or three months.\u201d Australia won\u2019t care and will be focused on breaking down a Nepal team that is going to sit far back enough almost to see some of those fine pieces in the nearby National Gallery of Australia. The locals don\u2019t have an A-League team to support and while Thursday\u2019s game is unlikely to be as well-matched as games in the salary-capped local competition, football logic suggests there will be a few goals and another step taken closer to Qatar.",

Guardian Australia understands that the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, convened a meeting between senior members of shadow cabinet and union leaders in Sydney on Friday to thrash out concerns over the new trade deals, with the unions arguing that the party should block the enabling legislation when it comes to parliament next week. The meeting was attended by the shadow ministers Richard Marles, Kristina Keneally, Jim Chalmers, Madeleine King, Katy Gallagher, Tony Burke, Pat Conroy and Stephen Jones, with a similar contingent of union leaders present.

The shadow trade minister, Madeleine King, said she would not pre-empt the parliamentary process, the review by the JSCOT committee, nor the processes of the federal Labor caucus. \u201cThese are long-term negotiations and there are parliamentary processes that we have to work through to reach the ratification stages of these agreements,\u201d King told Guardian Australia in a statement. \u201cGiven global trade tensions, it is imperative that Australia diversifies its comprehensive economic partnerships and trade relationships. \u201cLabor is continuing to speak with stakeholders, within the labour movement and beyond, on these agreements.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The government is preparing to make amendments to its proposed character test crackdown to win over the support of independent senator Jacqui Lambie. Facing opposition from Labor, Centre Alliance and the Greens, the Coalition needs to win over Lambie to change the Migration Act to make it easier to cancel the visas of non-citizens convicted of a serious crime punishable by two years\u2019 imprisonment, even if a jail term is not imposed. Experts have warned the bill could lead to a fivefold increase in the number of people facing deportation, with residents from New Zealand and humanitarian refugees disproportionately affected. Guardian Australia understands that the minister is in discussion with Lambie about changes to the bill needed to win over her crucial vote, but a spokeswoman for the senator would not comment on what changes she was seeking. \u201cJacqui has got some concerns about the character test, she has made those clear to the minister and she is pleased with how that conversation is going,\u201d a spokeswoman said. Changes to the government\u2019s proposed bill may centre on the impact of the legislation on New Zealand citizens, after Lambie appeared on NZ television last week saying she would use her Senate position to fight for the rights of New Zealanders choosing to live in Australia. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned we\u2019re all one. We\u2019re all Anzacs. And that is the way it\u2019s always been and that is the way it should remain,\u201d Lambie told TVNZ Q + A. She said she wanted New Zealanders to have an easier path to permanent residency and to enjoy the same rights as Australians. On Friday following bilateral meetings in Sydney, New Zealand\u2019s foreign minister Winston Peters said he had \u201creasons to believe\u201d the legislation could be changed to address the concerns of his country. \u201cWe\u2019re having discussions about an improved circumstance on that issue \u2026 and the proposal is not fixed in stone at this point in time,\u201d Peters said. \u201cWe seek to be optimistic about this, to get a better outcome than the one we\u2019ve currently got, and we\u2019re hopeful that that is going to happen, and thus far we\u2019ve got reasons to believe it will happen.\u201d Asked if he believed the bill would not pass in its current form, Peters said: \u201cI could take a pretty serious bet I\u2019m right on that.\u201d New Zealand has pushed for Australia to have reciprocal arrangements for New Zealand citizens, including adopting a 10-year threshold that would mean any long-term resident was not deported. The negotiations with Lambie come as Centre Alliance senator Stirling Griff confirmed that the party would join Labor and the Greens in opposing the changes. \u201cThe existing migration laws are already quite strong and give the minister broad powers to cancel the visa of someone who is not of good character or who commits any serious offence,\u201d Griff told Guardian Australia. \u201cCentre Alliance considers this bill lowers the bar too far and could have significant unintended consequences.\u201d The government has already rejected conditions demanded by the opposition in order to secure its support, which included ensuring the bill was not applied retrospectively, exempting low-level offences, and giving special consideration to New Zealanders.",

      "bodyText": "The former defence minister Christopher Pyne\u2019s firm is lobbying for a Sydney-based space company that has won more than $2m in contracts from the defence department in the past year. Pyne\u2019s lobbying firm, GC Advisory Pty Ltd, was last month engaged by Saber Astronautics, a company that offers services to support space operations, conducts research and development and designs space systems. Last month it took part in a joint exercise with US military organisations to test US space forces\u2019 preparedness for combat. Tender records show Saber, in the 12 months before it engaged GC Advisory, won three contracts with the defence department worth about $2.7m. That includes a $2.1m contract awarded in July to provide \u201cintelligent data fusion services\u201d. The contracts were all awarded through an open and competitive process and there is no suggestion of impropriety. But concerns have been raised about the engagement of Pyne\u2019s firm. The lobbying code prohibits former government ministers from engaging \u201cin lobbying activities relating to any matter that they had official dealings with in their last 18 months in office\u201d. Ministerial standards prevent former ministers from lobbying or holding business meetings with members of the government, parliament, public service or defence force on any matter for which they held ministerial responsibility for 18 months after leaving parliament. They also require ministers not to use information they have obtained in office for private gain. A Senate inquiry has already considered Pyne\u2019s acceptance of a job with consulting giant EY to help grow its defence business. Pyne has previously been cleared of any breach of the standards by the department of prime minister and cabinet. The crossbench senator Rex Patrick said the lobbying for Saber appeared to be a repeat of the EY case. \u201cUnfortunately we\u2019ve in some sense exhausted of what we can do because it\u2019s a repeat of the conduct that the inquiry has already looked at,\u201d Patrick told Guardian Australia. \u201cIt just reaffirms the problem with what has been allowed to happen by the prime minister. The prime minister has \u2026 in effect he has a standard that has no standard.\u201d GC Advisory said that Pyne did not lobby for any defence clients and complied with all rules. \u201cAs stated at the Senate inquiry, Mr Pyne is well aware of the code of conduct for previous ministers and he abides by it,\u201d a spokesman said. Pyne is one of two principals working at the firm. The other is Adam Howard, a former chief of staff to Pyne, who left the office more than a year ago. The lobbyist register \u2013 the only real public window into federal lobbying \u2013 does not currently show Saber as a client of GC Advisory. The relationship is revealed in evidence presented to the Senate inquiry on Tuesday detailing GC Advisory\u2019s clients. A response to a question on notice by the attorney-general\u2019s department lists Saber as a \u201cpending\u201d client of GC Advisory as of September 3. Saber did not respond to requests for comment.",

      "body": "<p>After weeks of phoney war, Tuesday felt like a possible shift in the Brexit impasse \u2013 but one based largely on recriminations and anger and containing several mixed messages.</p> <h2>What has changed?</h2> <p>In brief: a wave of anonymous briefings from inside Downing Street effectively exploded a small bomb under the Brexit process. Overnight, a long memo <a href=\"https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2019/10/how-number-10-view-the-state-of-the-negotiations/\">sent to the Spectator</a> predicted the ongoing talks with the EU <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/08/boris-johnson-ready-to-give-up-on-brexit-deal\">would fail</a> and threatened the withdrawal of some security cooperation in response. Hours later <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SamCoatesSky/status/1181498839716503553\">another mystery briefing</a>, given to select broadcast journalists, said a phone call between Boris Johnson and Angela Merkel had effectively torpedoed the talks, as Merkel had insisted on a solution for the Irish border that left Northern Ireland in permanent alignment with the EU.</p> <h2>Does this mean Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan is officially over?</h2> <p>No. Downing Street\u2019s public line is that a deal is still possible. Johnson\u2019s spokesman described the call with Merkel as \u201cfrank\u201d \u2013 diplomatic code for extremely frosty \u2013 but insisted talks were continuing, although they would now have to \u201cmove at pace\u201d to achieve anything. Answering questions in the Commons later, Michael Gove <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/08/uk-prepared-for-no-deal-brexit-but-some-risks-remain-says-gove\">insisted</a> the government still had a \u201cstrong desire to leave with a deal\u201d.</p> <h2>Why are different parts of Downing Street saying different things?</h2> <p>This is becoming something of a pattern for the Johnson administration: advisers anonymously briefing favourite journalists about their sometimes incendiary thinking while the PM\u2019s spokesman, a civil servant, says something else without publicly disavowing the briefings. Some of this is minor turf wars between Johnson staffers, but it mainly seems to be an attempt to exercise deniable control over the pre-election agenda, to get in place a narrative for voters that the collapse of talks is entirely the fault of a perfidious EU.</p> <h2>Who is doing all this briefing?</h2> <p>The long memo sent to the Spectator has been widely ascribed to Dominic Cummings, Johnson\u2019s chief adviser, a man with a history of <a href=\"https://dominiccummings.com/the-odyssean-project-2/\">penning lengthy diatribes</a> blaming misfortunes on the inability of other parties to keep pace with his own genius.

      "bodyText": "After weeks of phoney war, Tuesday felt like a possible shift in the Brexit impasse \u2013 but one based largely on recriminations and anger and containing several mixed messages. What has changed? In brief: a wave of anonymous briefings from inside Downing Street effectively exploded a small bomb under the Brexit process. Overnight, a long memo sent to the Spectator predicted the ongoing talks with the EU would fail and threatened the withdrawal of some security cooperation in response. Hours later another mystery briefing, given to select broadcast journalists, said a phone call between Boris Johnson and Angela Merkel had effectively torpedoed the talks, as Merkel had insisted on a solution for the Irish border that left Northern Ireland in permanent alignment with the EU. Does this mean Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan is officially over? No. Downing Street\u2019s public line is that a deal is still possible. Johnson\u2019s spokesman described the call with Merkel as \u201cfrank\u201d \u2013 diplomatic code for extremely frosty \u2013 but insisted talks were continuing, although they would now have to \u201cmove at pace\u201d to achieve anything. Answering questions in the Commons later, Michael Gove insisted the government still had a \u201cstrong desire to leave with a deal\u201d. Why are different parts of Downing Street saying different things? This is becoming something of a pattern for the Johnson administration: advisers anonymously briefing favourite journalists about their sometimes incendiary thinking while the PM\u2019s spokesman, a civil servant, says something else without publicly disavowing the briefings. Some of this is minor turf wars between Johnson staffers, but it mainly seems to be an attempt to exercise deniable control over the pre-election agenda, to get in place a narrative for voters that the collapse of talks is entirely the fault of a perfidious EU. Who is doing all this briefing? The long memo sent to the Spectator has been widely ascribed to Dominic Cummings, Johnson\u2019s chief adviser, a man with a history of penning lengthy diatribes blaming misfortunes on the inability of other parties to keep pace with his own genius. With other briefings it is less clear, but they are likely to have come from a handful of political appointees inside No 10 who work on communications and strategy. Downing Street has yet to disown any of the recent messages, so they can be presumed to be genuine. What has been the non-UK reaction? The German government has refused to comment beyond confirming that Merkel and Johnson spoke on Tuesday morning, but other reaction has been more pointed. Donald Tusk, the European council president, tweeted: \u201cWhat\u2019s at stake is not winning some stupid blame game. At stake is the future of Europe and the UK as well as the security and interests of our people.\u201d Could the UK cut security cooperation with the EU? This seems extremely unlikely, not to mention counterproductive. In the Commons, Gove declined repeated invitations from MPs to condemn the anonymous briefings but assured them the UK would cooperate fully on such matters post-Brexit. Is a deal impossible? It would seem so, and this had always appeared the most likely case under Johnson, whatever his protestations. The government\u2019s new plan, involving an uncertain future regime of border checks in Ireland (even if not at the border), always seemed likely be rejected by both Dublin and Brussels. There has always been a fundamental contradiction between the EU\u2019s insistence that its single market cannot be compromised, the UK\u2019s long-established red lines of no single market or customs union membership or a regulatory border in the Irish Sea, and the obligations under the Good Friday peace deal to avoid a hard Irish border. This contradiction has now, perhaps, finally met reality. So what happens now? That is the big question, or rather series of questions. Downing Street still maintains its legally contradictory position that it will abide by legislation mandating a Brexit extension if no deal is reached by an EU summit next week, but also that the UK will leave on 31 October. There are countless theories as to how that will pan out. In the slightly longer term, an election seems inevitable \u2013 one in which Boris Johnson will cast himself as a Brexit martyr who was foiled by the EU and a rebellious Commons. It is likely to be a brutal and cynical campaign.",

Eight months ago in Australia, Murray <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2019/jan/11/emotional-andy-murray-considers-retirement-video\" title=\"\">broke down during a press conference</a>, seemingly announcing that his career was coming to an end. After his loss, he was awkwardly beckoned off the court with an emotional farewell video from his colleagues.</p> \n<p>The video has not aged well. Craig Tiley, the Australian Open tournament director, announced on Tuesday that Murray will return in 2020 to compete in his first grand slam singles match since undergoing hip resurfacing surgery. \u201cA year ago, we retired Andy Murray,\u201d he said on Channel Nine news. \u201cIt was his last event and during the course of the year he has had hip surgery and he announced today that he is coming back to play in January.\u201d</p> \n<p>After a timid singles return in August, Murray is picking up steam. He committed to three consecutive events in China with the simple goal of playing a couple of matches each week but he has found that his progress has been surprisingly swift. Murray <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/24/andy-murray-beats-tennys-sandgren-zhuhai-championships-tennis\" title=\"\">won his first match of his comeback</a> against the world No 69 Tennys Sandgren in Zhuhai, then he surprised himself by toppling No 13 Matteo Berrettini in Beijing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/apr/29/andy-murray-dominic-thiem-barcelona-open-semi-finals\" title=\"\">before losing</a> 6-2, 7-6 (3) in a competitive quarter-final against the No 5 Dominic Thiem.</p> \n<p>Murray\u2019s metal hip is still recovering but in Shanghai he has shown that his serve is already more potent, he is moving magnificently for a man who underwent hip surgery in January and his doubles play has inspired him to flit to the net more frequently. Fognini, a talented Italian with magic hands who won the Monte Carlo Masters 1000 title in May, put Murray\u2019s improving form to the test.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d37e69069b76ecf4a2e4825fe5a575fa46251641\"> \n <img src=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2019/10/08/Fog_Murray_2.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Murray in action against Fognini in Shanghai.\" width=\"3024\" height=\"1814\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andy Murray in action against Fognini in Shanghai.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The Italian planted himself on the baseline and constantly moved the ball around, putting Murray under immense pressure, but the Briton stood up to a high-quality opponent and responded with spectacular variety and defence. In the end, rather than his hip, Murray\u2019s lack of match practice came back to hurt him as he twice failed to serve out the match against Fognini at 5-4 and 6-5 in a combative third set before he was thoroughly outplayed in the tie-break.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s the first time ever in my career that that\u2019s happened,\u201d Murray said. \u201cI think it\u2019s the first time I served for a match twice and not won.\u201d</p> \n<p>As well as the on-court progress Murray has made, there has been a transformation for his life off the court. \u201cMy whole life was pretty much consumed by this pain in my hip,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was every minute of the day.\u201d</p> \n<p>Murray can now put on his socks, play with his daughters and sleep at night without discomfort. He is happy. When asked last week what has pleased him most in his comeback, he simply smiled: \u201cNo pain. Zero pain in my hip.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "On a day when it was revealed that Andy Murray will make his grand slam singles return at the Australian Open, he came close to the best win of his comeback from hip surgery in the wake of his last major appearance in Melbourne this year. In Tuesday\u2019s second round against the 10th seed, Fabio Fognini, at the Shanghai Masters, Murray eventually fell 7-6 (4), 2-6, 7-6( 2) in a fast-paced and high-quality match. The match was notable for a row between the two late on in the contest, with Murray furious when Fognini deliberately called out as he was about to put away a volley. As the pair bickered on the changeover, Murray dismissed his opponent by telling him to \u201cshut up\u201d. The Scot said: \u201cFabio wanted to engage with me, I probably shouldn\u2019t have done, but I am not having him talk to me like that on court.\u201d Murray\u2019s competitive fire clearly still burns as he moves closer to his return to grand slam singles competition. Eight months ago in Australia, Murray broke down during a press conference, seemingly announcing that his career was coming to an end. After his loss, he was awkwardly beckoned off the court with an emotional farewell video from his colleagues. The video has not aged well. Craig Tiley, the Australian Open tournament director, announced on Tuesday that Murray will return in 2020 to compete in his first grand slam singles match since undergoing hip resurfacing surgery. \u201cA year ago, we retired Andy Murray,\u201d he said on Channel Nine news. \u201cIt was his last event and during the course of the year he has had hip surgery and he announced today that he is coming back to play in January.\u201d After a timid singles return in August, Murray is picking up steam. He committed to three consecutive events in China with the simple goal of playing a couple of matches each week but he has found that his progress has been surprisingly swift. Murray won his first match of his comeback against the world No 69 Tennys Sandgren in Zhuhai, then he surprised himself by toppling No 13 Matteo Berrettini in Beijing before losing 6-2, 7-6 (3) in a competitive quarter-final against the No 5 Dominic Thiem. Murray\u2019s metal hip is still recovering but in Shanghai he has shown that his serve is already more potent, he is moving magnificently for a man who underwent hip surgery in January and his doubles play has inspired him to flit to the net more frequently. Fognini, a talented Italian with magic hands who won the Monte Carlo Masters 1000 title in May, put Murray\u2019s improving form to the test. The Italian planted himself on the baseline and constantly moved the ball around, putting Murray under immense pressure, but the Briton stood up to a high-quality opponent and responded with spectacular variety and defence. In the end, rather than his hip, Murray\u2019s lack of match practice came back to hurt him as he twice failed to serve out the match against Fognini at 5-4 and 6-5 in a combative third set before he was thoroughly outplayed in the tie-break. \u201cThat\u2019s the first time ever in my career that that\u2019s happened,\u201d Murray said. \u201cI think it\u2019s the first time I served for a match twice and not won.\u201d As well as the on-court progress Murray has made, there has been a transformation for his life off the court. \u201cMy whole life was pretty much consumed by this pain in my hip,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was every minute of the day.\u201d Murray can now put on his socks, play with his daughters and sleep at night without discomfort. He is happy. When asked last week what has pleased him most in his comeback, he simply smiled: \u201cNo pain. Zero pain in my hip.\u201d",

Allowing Northern Ireland to stay within the single market and customs union would change the balance of that arrangement, but not the principle.</p> <p>Northern Ireland would be economically closer to the Republic while remaining politically integrated within the UK. The maintenance of the current arrangements would in turn minimise calls for a border poll.</p> <p>The very spirit of the Good Friday agreement therefore leads to a customs border in the Irish Sea as the only way of simultaneously recognising the 2016 vote, the \u201cgentle erasure of the physical border between north and south\u201d and the place of Northern Ireland within the UK. Isn\u2019t that obvious, or am I missing something?<br><strong>Jeremy Waxman</strong><br><em>Canterbury</em></p> <p>\u2022 Having spent a year volunteering at a peace centre in Northern Ireland in 1975-76, I completely concur with Jonathan Freedland.</p> <p>I spent time in Ballymurphy and on the Shankill Road, and remember the dedication of priests and community activists who tried to make a difference by encouraging cross-community links. The current government proposals show a reckless disregard of the hard-won and fragile peace there. It has been harrowing to watch the recent BBC series Spotlight on the Troubles, with footage of bombings, shootings and failed negotiations.</p> <p>This must serve as a timely reminder that it is critical not to underestimate the risks of conflict resurfacing in the foreseeable future. The current plans include arrangements in Northern Ireland being decided by the DUP, who opposed the Good Friday agreement.</p> <p>However convenient it is to those in power at present to forget recent history, this amnesia poses a risk to the safety of all British citizens, not just those in Northern Ireland.<br><strong>Jill Moss</strong><br><em>Chester</em></p> <p>\u2022 Anyone who needs to be reminded of the harrowing and unbelievable events of the Troubles should read the first-hand accounts of the direct impact on families and friends in a collection of journalistic memories.</p> <p>Reporting the Troubles, jointly edited by Deric Henderson and Ivan Little, who was my childhood neighbour growing up in Belfast, is not an easy read, but it is essential for those politicians, and anyone else, who are in danger of forgetting. <br><strong>Liz Stanley</strong><br><em>Northumberland</em></p> <p>\u2022 Jonathan Freedland refers to the particularly English disdain for \u201clittle Ireland\u201d and to the fact that the Republic is \u201cbacked by 26 members of the EU\u201d. While it would be understandable for those nations to put economic self-interest before the post-Brexit consequences for one of their smallest colleagues, it is much to their credit that solidarity prevails.</p> <p>Future historians may well find fault with the EU\u2019s attitude to the Greek crisis, but its unfailing support for Ireland and for the maintenance of peace between Northern Ireland and the Republic is commendable. It makes you wonder if such an estimable club isn\u2019t worth the membership fee.<br><strong>Peter Chapman</strong><br><em>Ashwell, </em><em>Hertfordshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 I am bemused by Arlene Foster\u2019s insistence that Leo Varadkar would \u201cgo down in history as the man who instituted a hard border on the island of Ireland\u201d if he failed to accept the UK\u2019s Brexit proposals (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/03/eu-calls-on-boris-johnson-to-publish-brexit-plan-in-full\" title=\"\">Johnson \u2018is misleading MPs\u2019 over Brexit plan</a>, 4 October).</p> <p>This from the leader of the party whose intransigence forced Theresa May to move from an Ireland-only backstop, agreed with the EU, to a UK-wide backstop \u2013 which the DUP then voted against in parliament.</p> <p>The purpose of the backstop, in both its iterations, is to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland. As well as a poor memory, it seems that Foster has no sense of irony. <br><strong>Mike Pender</strong><br><em>Cardiff</em></p> <p>\u2022 Insistence by the Irish government on a watertight backstop may precipitate a no-deal Brexit with an EU-imposed hard border.</p> <p>Cross-border trade is 0.85% of EU-UK trade.

      "bodyText": "Jonathan Freedland (Peace in Ireland is precious. How did we forget that so quickly?, 5 October) provides a powerful reminder that it was the UK and Ireland\u2019s membership of the EU that meant that \u201cthe border between them could fade to invisibility\u201d. The key to the Good Friday agreement was that it enabled the citizens of Northern Ireland to identify as Irish or British. Allowing Northern Ireland to stay within the single market and customs union would change the balance of that arrangement, but not the principle. Northern Ireland would be economically closer to the Republic while remaining politically integrated within the UK. The maintenance of the current arrangements would in turn minimise calls for a border poll. The very spirit of the Good Friday agreement therefore leads to a customs border in the Irish Sea as the only way of simultaneously recognising the 2016 vote, the \u201cgentle erasure of the physical border between north and south\u201d and the place of Northern Ireland within the UK. Isn\u2019t that obvious, or am I missing something? Jeremy Waxman Canterbury \u2022 Having spent a year volunteering at a peace centre in Northern Ireland in 1975-76, I completely concur with Jonathan Freedland. I spent time in Ballymurphy and on the Shankill Road, and remember the dedication of priests and community activists who tried to make a difference by encouraging cross-community links. The current government proposals show a reckless disregard of the hard-won and fragile peace there. It has been harrowing to watch the recent BBC series Spotlight on the Troubles, with footage of bombings, shootings and failed negotiations. This must serve as a timely reminder that it is critical not to underestimate the risks of conflict resurfacing in the foreseeable future. The current plans include arrangements in Northern Ireland being decided by the DUP, who opposed the Good Friday agreement. However convenient it is to those in power at present to forget recent history, this amnesia poses a risk to the safety of all British citizens, not just those in Northern Ireland. Jill Moss Chester \u2022 Anyone who needs to be reminded of the harrowing and unbelievable events of the Troubles should read the first-hand accounts of the direct impact on families and friends in a collection of journalistic memories. Reporting the Troubles, jointly edited by Deric Henderson and Ivan Little, who was my childhood neighbour growing up in Belfast, is not an easy read, but it is essential for those politicians, and anyone else, who are in danger of forgetting. Liz Stanley Northumberland \u2022 Jonathan Freedland refers to the particularly English disdain for \u201clittle Ireland\u201d and to the fact that the Republic is \u201cbacked by 26 members of the EU\u201d. While it would be understandable for those nations to put economic self-interest before the post-Brexit consequences for one of their smallest colleagues, it is much to their credit that solidarity prevails. Future historians may well find fault with the EU\u2019s attitude to the Greek crisis, but its unfailing support for Ireland and for the maintenance of peace between Northern Ireland and the Republic is commendable. It makes you wonder if such an estimable club isn\u2019t worth the membership fee. Peter Chapman Ashwell, Hertfordshire \u2022 I am bemused by Arlene Foster\u2019s insistence that Leo Varadkar would \u201cgo down in history as the man who instituted a hard border on the island of Ireland\u201d if he failed to accept the UK\u2019s Brexit proposals (Johnson \u2018is misleading MPs\u2019 over Brexit plan, 4 October). This from the leader of the party whose intransigence forced Theresa May to move from an Ireland-only backstop, agreed with the EU, to a UK-wide backstop \u2013 which the DUP then voted against in parliament. The purpose of the backstop, in both its iterations, is to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland. As well as a poor memory, it seems that Foster has no sense of irony. Mike Pender Cardiff \u2022 Insistence by the Irish government on a watertight backstop may precipitate a no-deal Brexit with an EU-imposed hard border. Cross-border trade is 0.85% of EU-UK trade. I am lost for a metaphor: gnats and camels; motes and beams; babies and bathwater don\u2019t come close.

What \u2013 apart from placing humans rather than the gods at the centre of the cosmos \u2013 does this assertion actually mean? <a href=\"http://dailynous.com/2019/09/23/myles-burnyeat-1939-2019/\" title=\"\">Myles Burnyeat</a>, who has died aged 80, showed how the close study of classical texts could be used as a platform for creative philosophical endeavour.</p> <p>Protagoras\u2019 observation is usually called the Man/Measure (M/M) doctrine, though a better translation would frame it in terms of humankind. Does humanity as a whole decide what is (true), or each individual human? And if the latter, does the individual decide what is absolutely true, or only what is true relatively to her or him?</p> <p><a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sextus-empiricus/\" title=\"\">Sextus Empiricus</a>, from around AD200, interpreted the M/M as a subjectivist doctrine: each person decides what is absolutely the case. <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato/\" title=\"\">Plato</a>, who died in 347BC, treated it as a relativist claim: what I judge to be the case is the case for me. Yet both Plato and Sextus Empiricus argue that the M/M is self-refuting. Are they right?</p> <p>In a pair of articles in 1976, Burnyeat argued compellingly that on either reading the M/M is indeed self-refuting if tested in debate. If the M/M is interpreted in the subjectivist sense, then it only takes one person to disagree with the M/M for it to be false. The relativist reading is more subtle: does it matter if Protagoras says that the M/M is true only for him, while Socrates claims that the M/M is not true for him? Yes, maintains Burnyeat, it does matter.</p> <p>It is not simply that such a position would condemn Protagoras to isolation within his own private bubble, a bubble from which he could not converse with others; it is the inescapable fact that the M/M is the one thing Protagoras claims as absolutely true; so, again, it will take only one person to disagree with it for it to be false. </p> <p>This critique of the M/M was taken up again by Burnyeat in his book-length introduction to <a href=\"https://blackwells.co.uk/bookshop/product/The-Theaetetus-of-Plato-by-Myles-Burnyeat-M-J-Levett-Plato/9780915144815\" title=\"\">MJ Levett\u2019s translation of Plato\u2019s Theaetetus</a> (1990), where he showed how Plato links it to the metaphysical view that the cosmos is in a state of flux \u2013 the view of the Presocratic philosopher <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/heraclitus/\" title=\"\">Heraclitus</a>.</p> <p>But, like Protagorean relativism, Heraclitean flux also cannot be adequately articulated and defended: there would be no fixed objects to be named and no fixed words to name them.

What \u2013 apart from placing humans rather than the gods at the centre of the cosmos \u2013 does this assertion actually mean? Myles Burnyeat, who has died aged 80, showed how the close study of classical texts could be used as a platform for creative philosophical endeavour. Protagoras\u2019 observation is usually called the Man/Measure (M/M) doctrine, though a better translation would frame it in terms of humankind. Does humanity as a whole decide what is (true), or each individual human? And if the latter, does the individual decide what is absolutely true, or only what is true relatively to her or him?

Would-be pirates will enjoy the Horrible Histories Pirates exhibition and Jolly Roger tour, plus don\u2019t miss the Explosion Museum of Naval Firepower, which can be reached by water bus. Other city highlights include the Spice Island Treasure Trail, a self-guided trail that comes with a downloadable map that leads you around the historic centre\u2019s cobbled streets hunting for clues. Once you\u2019ve cracked the mystery, head to the top of the Emirates Spinnaker Tower for panoramic south-coast views (kids will enjoy the glass-bottomed sky walk). Station: Take Southern to Portsmouth Harbour station to be in the heart of the action. Forest fun in Ashdown The inspiration for AA Milne\u2019s Winnie-the-Pooh stories, Ashdown Forest is an area of outstanding natural beauty just 30 miles south of London. Families can hunt out the original places found in the stories, including Hundred Acre Wood and Galleon\u2019s Leap, and play Poohsticks on footbridges. Arrive at Crowborough station, which borders the forest. There you\u2019ll find riding schools, if you fancy a family trek by hoof rather than foot, plus a glamping site for longer visits. Station: Take Southern to Crowborough from London Victoria or East Croydon. Surfing in St Ives You can surf year-round at Porthmeor Beach, a pebble\u2019s throw from St Ives\u2019 narrow cobbled streets, quaint harbour and galleries. Book lessons for all ages at the St Ives Surf School and, after a morning catching waves (or at least trying to), tuck into a hearty lunch of chorizo burgers and hot chocolate at family-friendly Porthmeor Beach cafe. When you\u2019re not splashing around in the sea, there\u2019s the St Ives Museum, the Tate and the Cornish coast path to discover, plus the St Ives School of Painting, where you can drop in and pick up a family art trail kit (\u00a35). Station: St Ives, at the end of the St Ives Bay Line from St Erth, one of the most scenic rail journeys in the country, with coastal views of Carbis Bay and Hayle Towans. Culture in Cambridge This university city delivers for inquiring minds, thanks to its multitude of museums. Kids can handle fossils and follow dinosaur trails at the Sedgwick Museum of Earth Sciences, while the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology has activity sheets to complete on each floor \u2013 who doesn\u2019t want to see a Roman skeleton or a 500-year-old potato? Let little ones loose with the free Fitz Kit, filled with games and puzzles for five- to 12-year-olds, in Fitzwilliam Museum, while you check out previously unseen Edgar Degas paintings. No trip to Cambridge is complete without a punt on the River Cam, so wrap up warm and book a tour with Scudamore\u2019s (\u00a356 for two adults, two children) for trained guides full of interesting facts. Don\u2019t want the fun to end? Book a ghost walking tour around the spookiest parts of the city, or a special Halloween tour (adults \u00a310, under 12s \u00a36). Station: Take Thameslink to Cambridge station, a Grade II-listed building just a short walk from the city centre. Cycling in the New Forest Autumn is a splendid time of year to visit the New Forest National Park; think 78,000 hectares (193,000 acres) of trees turning red, gold and brown. The best way to explore is by bike, thanks to 140 miles of safe, off-road cycle tracks, not to mention the free-roaming ponies, deer, donkeys and sheep to spot along the way. Step off the train at Brockenhurst, where you can hire bikes (including e-bikes and kids\u2019 trailers) at Cyclexperience, and check out New Forest Cottages for family-friendly places to stay while you\u2019re there.

      "bodyText": "Thomas the Tank Engine by Rev W Awdry While it\u2019s not possible to visit the Reverend Awdry\u2019s fictitious Isle of Sodor, you can get pretty close to it with a ride on the Bluebell Railway through an idyllic 11-mile stretch of the Sussex countryside. Head first to East Grinstead, then walk a few minutes to turn back the clock more than a hundred years, to the age of steam. The Bluebell Railway heritage steam line, which runs to Sheffield Park and Garden, is also home to Stepney, a steam locomotive that featured in Awdry\u2019s original series. You can even dine in the cafe where Awdry met BBC producer Britt Allcroft in 1979, and was persuaded to have Thomas and co turned into a television series. Make the most of your day here with an All Day Rover ticket to hop on and off the trains at will, explore the stations, go for walks and find perfect picnic spots. Each station has been painstakingly restored to reflect a different period, which makes it super-easy for train-mad kids to believe that they really are chuffing their way through Awdry\u2019s bygone world. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets by J K Rowling While Potter fans can find infamous platform 9 \u00be at London\u2019s King\u2019s Cross station (follow the tourists), you need to head to the Highlands for the true Hogwarts Express experience. Described as the greatest railway journey in the world, the Jacobite steam train (running only until 25 October, so be quick) will take you on an 84-mile round trip from Fort William to Mallaig over the instantly recognisable Glenfinnan viaduct. This is the 21-arched bridge you\u2019ll remember from the Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets film, in which Harry has to conjure a flying Ford Anglia to catch up with the Hogwarts Express. It\u2019s also the place where Harry first encounters a Dementor, as the train screeches to an unexpected, icy halt in The Prisoner of Azkaban movie. Kids will love playing spot-the-scene from their window seat \u2013 look out for Loch Shiel, the stand-in for Hogwarts Lake, and the tall-treed island on Loch Eilt, where Dumbledore\u2019s grave lies. First Term at Malory Towers by Enid Blyton You don\u2019t need to be wearing a \u201cbrown coat, brown hat, orange ribbon and brown tunic\u201d to get a taste of how Darrell Rivers felt as she set off on the train for her first term at Enid Blyton\u2019s wondrous boarding school, Malory Towers. Although Blyton\u2019s fictitious school was set in Cornwall, Lancing college on the South Downs inspires a similar sense of awe. It\u2019s reached with Southern via Lancing station from London Victoria, a journey that takes 79 minutes. Visitors are welcome to look around its neo-gothic chapel \u2013 the largest school chapel in the world \u2013 and while it doesn\u2019t boast Malory Towers\u2019 seawater swimming pool cut into the rocks, Lancing Beach is just a short bus ride away. There you\u2019ll find a stretch of quiet pebbles, a skatepark, outdoor gym and, on windy days, dozens of kite surfers. If you continue on by train to Brighton (23 mins), and take the 29 bus to Isfield, you can pick up the Lavender Line \u2013 an old heritage steam route that will keep the nostalgia flowing. Perfect for smaller kids, the route offers a two-mile round trip through gorgeous countryside \u2013 and don\u2019t miss out on the pie of the day in Cinders, the buffet restaurant. Carrie\u2019s War by Nina Bawden This compelling wartime story begins with grownup Carrie revisiting the Welsh mining valley she was sent to as an 11-year-old girl to escape the Blitz. As she explores the now-abandoned railway track with her own children, Carrie begins to remember the adventures she had in and around Druid\u2019s Bottom. Recreate a similar journey by taking the train from London Paddington to Cardiff (a touch over two hours), then it\u2019s just over an hour on to Merthyr Tydfil. Perched on the edge of the Brecon Beacons, this ex-mining town is a great base from which to explore some of Bawden\u2019s landscape. First, head to the Brecon Mountain Railway, where a steam train runs from Pant to Torpantau, taking in lakes, forests and a steep climb above the stunning Pentwyn Reservoir. Parc Taf Bargoed is a spectacular wild park that sits on the site of three former coalmines and, farther west, the village of Pontneddfechan (25 mins by bus from Merthyr) offers a gateway to so-called Waterfall Country, where you\u2019ll discover breathtaking cascades and crystal-clear pools. The Railway Children by E Nesbit When Bobbie, Peter and Phyllis are uprooted from London and sent to live in Yorkshire with their mother, the daily chug-past of a steam train becomes the thread that connects them with their old life and absent father. Step back into the intriguing world of the Waterbury children at the Keighley and Worth Valley Railway in West Yorkshire, a heritage steam line that packs six stations into just five miles of track.

Lullingstone Roman Villa, with its preserved mosaics and wall paintings, is well worth a stop, with Roman dress-up and human skeletons on offer.

In club football, he is most well known for his time with Bayern, for whom he made 500 appearances and won eight Bundesliga titles <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/may/25/borussia-dortmund-bayern-munich-champions-league\">as well as the Champions League in 2013</a>. On the international stage, his 121 appearances make him Germany\u2019s fourth-most capped player of all time. He won the World Cup with Germany in 2014.</p> <p>In 2015, Schweinsteiger moved to the Premier League, becoming the first German to play in Manchester United\u2019s first team. However, he never established himself at Old Trafford and had a fraught relationship when Jos\u00e9 Mourinho arrived to manage the club in 2016. Mourinho would later say he \u201cregretted\u201d the way he had treated Schweinsteiger, but the midfielder was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/apr/03/bastian-schweinsteiger-chicago-fire-debut-mls\">allowed to leave United in March 2017 for Chicago Fire</a>.</p> <p>In his debut MLS season, Schweinsteiger helped the Fire to their first playoff appearance since 2012 and he was named the club\u2019s player of the season in 2018. However, the team has struggled in the last two seasons and, despite a 5-2 over Orlando City in Schweinsteiger\u2019s final ever match, they missed the postseason once again in 2019.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The former Bayern Munich, Germany and Manchester United midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger has announced his retirement from football at the age of 35. \u201cDear fans, the time has now come, and I will be finishing my active career at the end of this season,\u201d he wrote in a post on social media on Tuesday. \u201cI would like to thank both you, my teams FC Bayern, Manchester United, Chicago Fire and the German national team. You made this unbelievable time possible for me! \u201cAnd of course, I would like to thank my wife Ana Ivanovic and my family for their support. Saying goodbye as an active player makes me feel a little nostalgic, but I am also looking forward to the exciting challenges that await me soon. I will remain faithful to football.\u201d Schweinsteiger made the announcement after his current team, Chicago Fire, missed this season\u2019s MLS playoffs. In club football, he is most well known for his time with Bayern, for whom he made 500 appearances and won eight Bundesliga titles as well as the Champions League in 2013. On the international stage, his 121 appearances make him Germany\u2019s fourth-most capped player of all time. He won the World Cup with Germany in 2014. In 2015, Schweinsteiger moved to the Premier League, becoming the first German to play in Manchester United\u2019s first team. However, he never established himself at Old Trafford and had a fraught relationship when Jos\u00e9 Mourinho arrived to manage the club in 2016. Mourinho would later say he \u201cregretted\u201d the way he had treated Schweinsteiger, but the midfielder was allowed to leave United in March 2017 for Chicago Fire. In his debut MLS season, Schweinsteiger helped the Fire to their first playoff appearance since 2012 and he was named the club\u2019s player of the season in 2018. However, the team has struggled in the last two seasons and, despite a 5-2 over Orlando City in Schweinsteiger\u2019s final ever match, they missed the postseason once again in 2019.",

      "bodyText": "A clear majority of Americans now support the impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump, according to a new poll. Even among Republicans, support for the inquiry has jumped 21 points since July. The Washington Post-Schar School poll released on Tuesday shows 58% support for the impeachment inquiry being conducted by Democrats in the House of Representatives, with 38% against. Almost half of those polled, 49%, said the House should impeach Trump and recommend that he be removed from office. According to the newspaper, \u201cprevious Post-Schar School or Post-ABC News polls taken \u2026 this year found majorities of Americans opposing the start of an impeachment proceeding, with 37% to 41% saying they favoured such a step. \u201cThe recent revelations appear to have prompted many Americans to rethink their position.\u201d An average of impeachment polls conducted by the website fivethirtyeight.com puts national support for impeachment at a little over 48% and opposition close to 44%. The \u201crecent revelations\u201d driving public opinion are centered around Trump\u2019s conduct towards the leader of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelinskiy, particularly a 25 July phone call in which the US president sought to have his opposite number investigate Joe Biden, a likely rival for the White House, over unsubstantiated allegations of corruption. The motivation for a temporary freezing of military aid to Ukraine, mandated by Trump, is also in question. In the Post-Schar School poll, 58% of respondents said the freezing of aid mattered when judging Trump\u2019s conduct. The furious partisan fight over impeachment intensified on Tuesday when the Trump administration blocked the US ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland from testifying to House Democrats in private. WhatsApp messages released to Congress show Sondland and the Ukraine special envoy, Kurt Volker, who recently resigned that post, were involved in attempts to manage Trump\u2019s pressure on Zelinskiy. Trump said on Twitter Sondland had been prevented from appearing before \u201ca totally compromised kangaroo court where Republican\u2019s rights have been taken away, and true facts are not allowed out for the public\u201d. But the Post also pointed out indications that partisan attitudes to impeachment are shifting. Nearly 80% of Democratic respondents now want Trump removed from office. Nearly 30% of Republicans support the impeachment inquiry, with nearly 20% favouring formal impeachment. Independent support for the impeachment inquiry, a key factor, is at 57%, with 49% saying the House should vote to remove Trump from office. Some Senate Republicans have criticised Trump\u2019s behaviour over Ukraine but the upper chamber remains highly unlikely to convict the president should it be asked to do so. Offering its \u201cfive takes from early polls on impeachment\u201d, the Brookings Institution thinktank wrote: \u201cAlthough the past two weeks have shifted the political terrain \u2026 the Democrats continue to face high odds against succeeding, and there is no guarantee that a failed effort to remove the president from office will serve their electoral interests.\u201d",

LSE took the crown for the largest faller, dropping over 4% after HKSE withdrew its \u00a332 billion bid. Even though investors knew it was a nonstarter from the word go, the fact that HKSE has walked away and can\u2019t return with another bid for 6 months has left investors noticeably disappointed.</p> <p>The pound is plunging lower and looks to break through $1.22 as hopes of the EU and the UK reaching a Brexit deal fade. The most recent reports from the BBC\u2019s political editor Laura Kuenssberg suggest that talks are in fact close to breaking down suggesting there is too much distance between them for a deal to be struck.</p> <p>This is not necessarily a great surprise given the EU\u2019s lukewarm reaction to Boris Johnson\u2019s final Brexit offer.

      "bodyText": "The FTSE 100 index has closed 54 points lower tonight, dropping 0.75% to finish at 7,143 points. The weak pound helped to prop up multinationals (by making their overseas earnings more valuable). Losses were heavier in Europe, with Germany\u2019s DAX down 1% and France\u2019s CAC losing 1.2%. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, blames today\u2019s selloff on three factors. Investor concerns over Brexit, the US \u2013 China trade dispute and the health of the US economy have all hit risk appetite, she says. The FTSE was the best of a bad bunch in Europe down 0.4% compared to the 1% sell on the Dax; but that was only owing to the pound tanking, which offered support to the multinational stocks listed on the UK index. Brexit vulnerable stocks such as the house builders and domestic focused banks dominated the lower reaches of the FTSE. LSE took the crown for the largest faller, dropping over 4% after HKSE withdrew its \u00a332 billion bid. Even though investors knew it was a nonstarter from the word go, the fact that HKSE has walked away and can\u2019t return with another bid for 6 months has left investors noticeably disappointed. The pound is plunging lower and looks to break through $1.22 as hopes of the EU and the UK reaching a Brexit deal fade. The most recent reports from the BBC\u2019s political editor Laura Kuenssberg suggest that talks are in fact close to breaking down suggesting there is too much distance between them for a deal to be struck. This is not necessarily a great surprise given the EU\u2019s lukewarm reaction to Boris Johnson\u2019s final Brexit offer. However, it appears to be the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back and is sending sterling sharply lower versus both the euro and the dollar. The IMF\u2019s new managing director is using her inaugural speech to warn that the global economy is now in a synchronised slowdown, and to urge politicians to act. Speaking in Washington, Kristalina Georgieva is warning that the Fund expects around 90% of the world to slow this year. She also warns that trade concludes could knock 0.8% of global GDP, or $700bn, by 2020. Georgieva, who has just succeeded Christine Lagarde, says: \u201cIn 2019, we expect slower growth in nearly 90 percent of the world. The global economy is now in a synchronized slowdown. This means that growth this year will fall to its lowest rate since the beginning of the decade. Here\u2019s the full story: Nearly every stock on the Dow Jones industrial average is down. Mining and construction equipment maker Caterpillar is leading the selloff in New York, down 2%. It\u2019s particularly vulnerable to the trade war, as a global slowdown hurts demand for its diggers. JP Morgan is close behind, losing 1.9%, with Goldman Sachs shedding 1.7%. Over in New York, stocks have dropped at the start of trading as fears over the US-China trade war flare up again. The Dow Jones industrial average has lost 257 points, or almost 1% at 26,220, while the broader S&amp;P 500 index has shed 1.1%. Financial stocks (-1.6%) and industrial firms (-1.5%) are leading the selloff, after the White House added another 28 Chinese companies to its trade blacklist. Hints from Beijing that this week\u2019s trade negotiations might wrap up early are also hitting stocks. The pound is continuing to drop on the currency exchanges, as hopes of a Brexit breakthrough this month wither. Sterling just dropped below $1.22 for the first time since early September, and has now lost 0.7% against the euro to \u20ac1.112 (also a five-week low). The pound remains under pressures, after an anonymous No 10 source said German chancellor Angela Merkel had \u201cmade clear a deal is overwhelmingly unlikely\u201d. Losses intensified after outgoing European Council chief Donald Tusk accused Boris Johnson of trying to win a \u201cstupid blame game\u201d, rather than negotiating seriously. Andy Scott, associate director at financial risk advisor JCRA, says City traders expect a lot more volatility, as Britain heads towards a general election: \u201cSterling\u2019s decline following reports of the imminent collapse of Brexit talks is not a surprise, since it all but confirms that a withdrawal agreement will not be reached before the current Brexit date. The drop in Sterling indicates that the small amount of optimism which existed for a deal by next week\u2019s EU summit among some investors, has faded. \u201cToday\u2019s reports presumably mean the government will have to request an extension \u2013 to which the EU have said they will agree. An extension would allow for a general election and a new government to decide the next steps. More telling is Sterling\u2019s implied volatility in the FX options market, which acts as a market gauge of expected movement in a currency\u2019s price, has fallen for one month\u2019s time, but increased for both three and six months. This suggests that traders expect less movement in Sterling over the current Brexit date, and more in three and six months\u2019 time.\u201d Over in Athens, the Greek government has successfully raised \u20ac1.5bn from international investors, by reopening an outstanding debt issue due in March 2029. My colleague Helena Smith reports: The country, once at the epicentre of the euro debt crisis, has capitalised on historically low borrowing costs. Announcing the offer on morning TV, finance minister Christos Staikouras said initial guidance pointed to a yield of about 1.55 percent on the 10-year bond \u2013 the lowest ever. Athens hoped to raise \u20ac1.5bn.... and investors have shown plenty of interest, submitting \u20ac5.4bn of bids. This is the fourth debt sale since Athens exited its third international bailout in August last year. The country\u2019s Public Debt Management Agency originally raised \u20ac2.5bn when it issued the 10-year bond on March 5. Close to 400 investors had signalled interest in the issue. Greece wants to raise up to \u20ac7bn euros from debt markets this year. The sale comes as prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis\u2019 business friendly administration unveiled an ambitious 2020 budget, its first since ousting former leftist prime minister Alexis Tsipras from power. The budget foresees growth climbing to 2.8% next year from the forecast rate of 2.0% this year on the back of corporate and other tax cuts that it hopes will stimulate private spending and lure foreign investors. Basketball has also got caught up in the US-China tensions, after the general manager of the Houston Rockets expressed support for the protesters demonstrating in Hong Kong. Daryl Morey tweet, of an image reading \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand for Hong Kong\u201d has created an almighty row, with several Chinese businesses cutting ties with the team. China\u2019s state broadcaster CCTV has now halted plans to air the basketball league\u2019s pre-season games - as the NBA scrambles to rebuild relations with China. Both it, and the Rockets, have distanced themselves from Morey\u2019s views (he\u2019s also deleted the tweet, ). As my colleague Oliver Connolly has written, you might expect US sports bodies to be rather pro-freedom. But perhaps they\u2019re pro-money instead.... Even cartoons are fair game in the ongoing battle between Washington and Beijing. South Park has been hit, after taking aim at the practice of toning down American culture to avoid upsetting Chinese censors. In an episode called \u201cBand in China\u201d, the cartoon\u2019s creators also referenced memes comparing president Xi Jinping to Winnie the Pooh, and threw in a plot line about the mass internment, or re-education, camps inflicted on Uighurs and other Muslim minorities. Beijing has responded by purging South Park from Chinese streaming and social media platforms! My colleagues Stephanie Convery and Yang Tian explain: Chinese social media platform Weibo shows no results for the search term \u201cSouth Park\u201d in English or Chinese at the time of writing, though it does show truncated results if the search term is mixed language. Searching for the show on Reddit-like forum Baidu Tieba results in the notice: \u201cSorry, the results will not be displayed in accordance with relevant laws, regulations and policies.\u201d Video platform Youku also returns no results, though some clips still appear on Tudou, another video hosting platform. The Band in China episode is not one of them. Here are more details of the White House\u2019s latest battle with China, via Bloomberg: The Trump administration is moving ahead with discussions around possible restrictions on capital flows into China, with a particular focus on investments made by U.S. government pension funds, people familiar with the internal deliberations said. The efforts are advancing even after American officials pushed back strongly against a Bloomberg News report late last month that a range of such limits was under review. Trump officials last week held meetings on the issue just hours after White House adviser Peter Navarro dismissed the report as \u201cfake news,\u201d and zeroed in on how to prevent U.S. government retirement funds from financing China\u2019s economic rise, the people said. The office of Larry Kudlow, director of the White House\u2019s National Economic Council, convened a policy-coordination committee meeting last Tuesday, which also included officials from the National Security Council and the Treasury Department, the people added. An NEC spokesman declined to comment. More here: White House Zeroes In on Limit to Chinese Stocks in Pension Fund In another potential trade war escalation, the White House is reportedly looking to limit the amount of Chinese company stocks held in US government pension funds (Bloomberg reports). Brexit isn\u2019t the only crisis taking a turn for the worst today. The US-China trade war also appears to be escalating, sending European stock markets falling deeper into the red. Overnight, the White House blacklisted 28 Chinese companies from buying American products, over human rights violations. The Commerce Department said these firms had all been implicated in a campaign against Muslim minorities such as the Uighur people in the autonomous region of Xinjiang. China has responded by urging the US to correct their mistake, and hinting that it will retaliate. A delegation of Chinese officials, led by vice-premier Liu He, is due in Washington to restart trade talks on Thursday But in a worrying development, the South China Morning Post is reporting that the delegation could return home a day early - on Friday, rather than Saturday. That suggests some pessimism over the prospects for a breakthrough. European market are selling off in response: This chart shows how the pound has fallen steadily against the euro in recent weeks, to today\u2019s one-month low. Neil Wilson of Markets.com fears sterling could fall further: \u201cSterling is under the cosh again as hopes of a deal between the UK and EU fade. The last flicker of hope was snuffed out this morning after a call between the PM and chancellor Merkel of Germany left the process at an impasse. The news across the wires is that Merkel said a deal will only work if NI stays in the customs union. No 10 said this demand is impossible and that the EU is not engaging seriously. It\u2019s become clear a deal cannot be done, with the wording from Number 10 that a deal is \u2018essentially impossible not just now, but ever\u2019. Stalemate. We are now heading towards the Revoke versus No Deal showdown. The pound does not like the tone of all this. GBPUSD has slipped to session lows on the Oct 2nd lows at $1.22260, opening up a move back to the Oct 1st low at 1.220. If this goes then one senses the stops are out and we face a retest of the multi-year nadir on $1.19. Ouch! Sterling has dropped to a one-month low against the euro, as the Brexit crisis escalated. The pound shed half a eurocent to \u20ac1.115, the lowest since early September. It\u2019s also down half a cent against the US dollar, to $1.224. The selloff was triggered by a statement from with Downing Street, which reveals that PM Boris Johnson had a rather difficult conversation on Brexit with German chancellor Angela Merkel. According to this \u201cgovernment source\u201d, Berlin is insisting that Northern Ireland stays in Customs Union, if not, then a deal is \u2018overwhelmingly unlikely\u2019. That appears to scupper hopes of getting a Brexit deal agreed before 31 October. Andy Sparrow\u2019s Politics Live blog has all the details: Today\u2019s data show that Britain has achieved no productivity growth in the last four quarters. Productivity fell by 0.2% year-on-year in the third quarter of 2018. It then stagnated in Q4 2018 and Q1 2019, followed by the 0.5% slump in April-June. Tony Danker, chief executive of Be the Business (an organisation created to boost UK productivity) says businesses need to do more, or risk a productivity recession: \u201cToday\u2019s figures confirm the UK is on the verge of a productivity recession. Since the financial crisis, productivity has been stagnant but now we are seeing a definitive decline, which sets a dangerous precedent in a weakening wider economic context. This will ultimately impact wages, living standards and how competitive the UK\u2019s economy is in relation to other nations. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the entire business community to get match fit to compete for the next decade.\u201d The ONS has also reported that productivity per job stalled in April-June, ending a recent run of growth. The Institute of Directors is adamant that Brexit uncertainty is making the UK less productive. Tej Parikh, the IoD\u2019s chief economist, says this morning\u2019s weak productivity figures \u201chammer home\u201d the damage of uncertainty. \u201cUnsure of what\u2019s around the corner, businesses\u2019 investment in the new equipment and technology that drives up their performance has been stifled. Many companies are also trimming their investment pipelines for the year ahead to build up a cash cushion in anticipation of challenging economic conditions ahead. \u201cPolicymakers have been distracted from putting together the various pieces of the productivity puzzle, ranging from the skills agenda to infrastructure improvements. It will take a while before recent pledges by the Government on road and broadband networks filter into the productivity numbers. \u201cIn the meantime, cost reliefs and investment incentives are a must in order to give UK productivity a jolt. Business leaders would welcome an extraordinary Budget to support productivity increases, which will be crucial come no deal or otherwise.\u201d Newsflash: Britain\u2019s productivity problem remains unsolved, with output per worker falling at its fastest rate in five years. The Office for National Statistics has reported that productivity fell by 0.5% year-on-year in the April-June quarter, the biggest drop since Q2 2014. This follows two quarters of flat productivity. The ONS says that both services and manufacturing saw a fall in labour productivity growth of 0.8% and 1.9% respectively, compared with the same quarter in the previous year. Non-manufacturing production and construction were the only sectors to improve their productivity, while manufacturing and financial services both became less productive. Productivity will fall when an industry grows its workforce faster than its output. So, it\u2019s possible that companies are choosing to hire more staff, rather than investing in new machinery and equipment, until they have more clarity on Brexit. Elsewhere in the City, the London Stock Exchange has successfully batted away its Hong Kong rival. Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing abandoned its \u00a332bn takeover offer for the LSE this morning, saying it was \u201cunable to engage\u201d with management on the deal. In truth, few LSE investors were convinced by HKEX\u2019s pitch. Many questioned whether regulators would allow Britain\u2019s stock market to fall into foreign hands, particularly given the tensions in Hong Kong at present. The LSE just released a brief statement, saying it \u201cnotes\u201d HKEX\u2019s decision, and is pressing on with its own merger with data provider Refinitiv. Shares in the LSE have slumped 6% to around \u00a370 this morning, roughly their level before their Hong Kong suitor emerged. Steve Miley, a senior market analyst at www.asktraders.com, says Robert Walters\u2019 trading update shows that Brexit uncertainty is hurting the UK economy. Brexit uncertainty continues to negatively impact firms across the board, this is particularly evident in recruiter Robert Walters\u2019 Q3 results. Robert Walters reported an 11% fall in third quarter gross profits in the UK. This dismal figure reflects the paralysis in hiring that the British market is experiencing as firms await some sort of direction from Brexit. It has been well documented that firms have pressed the pause button on hiring and Robert Walters results confirm this. For as long as there is Brexit uncertainty, we can expect the hiring market to remain challenging. PageGroup\u2019s profit warning has dampened the mood in the City, says Connor Campbell of SpreadEx. The FTSE 250-firm announced it had suffered a 4.1% decline in Q3 profit in the region (alongside an 8% drop in Asia), highlighting Brexit uncertainty as the reason behind the slide. Investors sent the stock 7.3% lower in response, while also hammering Hays, PageGroup\u2019s sector peer tumbling 5.5%, This despite not actually announcing anything, the assumption being that its figures will mirror that of its troubled peer. Here\u2019s some early reaction to this morning\u2019s gloom from the recruitment industry: It\u2019s notable that both PageGroup and Robert Walters cite the Hong Kong protests in their respective trading updates. We already know that Hong Kong\u2019s economy shrank by 0.4% in the second quarter of 2019. Economists predict that GDP kept falling in the third quarter, which would put the region into recession. Tourism has obviously been hit by the clashes between demonstrators and police, while retailers and restaurants have suffered falling turnover, or been forced to shut. Beijing\u2019s attempts to clamp down on companies whose staff sympathise with the demonstrators may also have hurt recruitment - deterring some executives from moving to Hong Kong (remember, Cathay Pacific\u2019s CEO Rupert Hogg was forced out in August). Shares in another recruitment firm, Hays, have tumbled by 6% this morning even though it didn\u2019t say anything! City traders are obviously calculating that its business will suffer from the same combination of problems as its rivals, including Brexit uncertainty, and China\u2019s slowdown. PageGroup\u2019s shares have slumped by 15% at the open, as the City reacts to its warning. They\u2019re down 61p to 356p, making PageGroup the biggest faller on the FTSE 250 index. That\u2019s also their lowest level in almost three years. Shares in Robert Walters have tumbled 11% at the start of trading, after it cut its profit forecasts. They\u2019re down 55p at 432p. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Recruitment isn\u2019t the most exciting part of the economy - with its job applications, sifting of CVs and interview rounds. But it\u2019s a good indication of how companies are faring, because when bosses get nervous they have a tendency to stop hiring. So it\u2019s worrying that two UK recruitment firms have both issued downbeat trading statements today, laced with anxiety about geopolitical tensions. PageGroup, the FTSE 250-listed recruiter, has warned that profits will be weaker than expected this year. It has suffered a 4.1% drop in UK profits in the last quarter, and an 8% tumble across Asia. CEO Steve Ingham blames \u201cincreased macro-economic and political uncertainty\u201d in key markets -- singling out Brexit as one key factor. \u201cWe saw standout performances in Germany, India, and Latin America, as well as a strong performance in the US, despite a slowing Financial Services market in New York. However, we saw increasingly challenging trading conditions in many of our larger markets, including Greater China, the UK and France. \u201cLooking ahead, the deterioration in trading conditions seen during Q3 across the majority of our regions is anticipated to continue. In the UK, heightened Brexit related uncertainty is expected to remain as we approach and go beyond 31 October. Ingham adds that the Chinese market is softening, amid the trade war with China and the pro-democracy protest in Hong Kong. In Greater China, confidence in Mainland China continues to be affected by trade tariff uncertainty and the social unrest in Hong Kong is increasing. PageGroup now expects 2019 operating profit to be in the range of \u00a3140m to \u00a3150m -- not the \u00a3156.5m to \u00a3168m previously aimed for. That\u2019s a chunky reduction. Smaller rival recruiter Robert Walters has a similar story. Its gross UK profits have slumped by 11%, and blamed \u201csignificant political uncertainty in a number of the Group\u2019s markets\u201d. Those problems include Brexit, US-China trade tensions, and the ongoing problems in Hong Kong. CEO and founder Robert Walters says the firm is facing a \u2018unique\u2019 combination of headwinds: \u201cThe Group delivered net fee income growth of 2% (4% actual) during the third quarter as trading conditions softened across a number of markets. The ongoing uncertainty surrounding Brexit, the US-China trade tariff standoff and Hong Kong protests, coupled with the significant impact of the gilets-jaunes protests experienced earlier this year have combined to create a unique set of cumulative headwinds. The firm now expects profits to be flat this year -- previously analysts had expected pre-tax profits to swell to \u00a352m, from \u00a349m. Reaction to follow....

He added: \u201cWe come back home after this game, so we wish to shut the door in a very beautiful and loud way.\u201d He was talking about finishing off Russia\u2019s World Cup campaign, although of course if their defence holds up they could close the door on the Scots too. \u201cScotland selected a reserves squad against us so they can get ready for the match with Japan, which is more important for them,\u201d Gerasimov said. You get the sense they don\u2019t appreciate being taken lightly. Voytov said: \u201cOur chances are not bad given that they changed almost the whole lineup.\u201d",

In 1976, as Save the Whales campaigning merchandise flooded popular consciousness, and not long after Greenpeace launched its first anti-whaling campaign by confronting whaling fleets in the north Pacific, the comedians Peter Cook and Dudley Moore asked, in one of the most obscene, and funniest recordings ever made, what have the whales ever done for us? \u201cThey\u2019ve produced nothing in the way of literature,\u201d the pair quip. \u201cAll they eat is fucking plankton. Can you imagine drifting along in the sea with your mouth open with a lot of plankton going in?\u201d Well, between them and their plankton, the joke may be on us. Whales are ready to rescue the world. It is an extraordinary notion \u2013 given what we have done to them \u2013 but perhaps that Thames whale, as lost as it was in our river, offered us a kind of hope.",

      "bodyText": "European air safety regulators have told their US counterpart they want more testing on fixes to the troubled 737 Max flight-control systems before the plane is cleared to re-enter service. According to the Wall Street Journal, the EU\u2019s Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) told the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) it was not satisfied with demonstrations of the reconfigured safety systems on the planes, which were involved in two crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that killed 346 people. Boeing had initially scheduled the plane to re-enter service at the end of August but disagreements over software details, centered on how the plane\u2019s dual flight-control computers are now intended to start working together, have put that date back to at least the end of November. The aim, according to the Journal, is to add redundancy by having both computers work simultaneously to eliminate potential problems stemming from computer chip malfunctions. The issue is separate from changes to the aircraft\u2019s faulty Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) but related to an emergency procedure that can be used by pilots to address the plane\u2019s system malfunctions. Over the past months, Boeing and regulators have agreed on software revisions to MCAS designed to scale back the power, and reduce the likelihood of the system kicking in and forcing the plane\u2019s nose down. Last week Boeing\u2019s CEO, Dennis Muilenburg, said test pilots had completed more than 700 Max flights. \u201cWe are very confident in that software solution, and we are now just marching through the final steps on certifying that, so that everybody\u2019s confident in the safety of the airplane,\u201d he said at a public appearance in New York. The new issue was identified during tests in June when a test pilot found that the procedure took more time than was acceptable to execute. A spokesman for the aircraft maker said: \u201cWe continue to work with regulators on addressing their concerns and working through the process for certifying the 737 Max software and training updates and safely returning the airplane to service.\u201d The latest problems for Boeing come as pilots for Southwest Airlines, one of the largest operators of the troubled jet, sued the company, claiming the grounding of the 737 Max jets with the loss of 30,000 scheduled flights has cost them more than $100m in pay. In court papers, Southwest\u2019s pilots association accusing Boeing of lying when it said the planes were just as safe as their predecessors. \u201cOur pilots should not be expected to take a significant and ever-expanding financial loss as a result of Boeing\u2019s negligence,\u201d Jon Weaks, the union\u2019s president, said in a statement. In total, 387 737 Max flown by 60 airlines are grounded. Boeing\u2019s stock has dropped 11% since the 737 Max was grounded in March, costing the company $27bn in market capitalization.

My girls\u2019 faces when they saw Daffy Duck ... it was magical!\u201d Talking over chips and mayonnaise, Beckett is as wholesome and family-oriented in person as he is in his act. \u201cI lead quite a boring life really,\u201d he assures me in his chipper, estuary voice. \u201cI go to work, come home, look after my kids and go Nando\u2019s. It\u2019s not like, \u2018Oh my god, remember that crazy time I grew up in a brothel!?\u2019\u201d Beckett is, of course, downplaying his own appeal in a way that only primetime TV personalities can. Now 33, he only landed his first TV gig in 2012, having started comedy three years before that, but now he rarely seems to be off screens, a pre-watershed geezer who can also slip into the post-9pm slots with ease. You can find him doing his thing on 8 Out of 10 Cats, where he trades barbs with host Jimmy Carr, often based around Beckett\u2019s distinctive teeth. He\u2019s also a fixture of Celebs Go Dating, on which he provides a \u201charsh, pisstake-y\u201d voiceover that knowingly prods contestants such as Blue\u2019s Lee Ryan. He also does Saturday night extravaganzas like the Beeb\u2019s recently cancelled All Together Now, which he compered alongside Geri Horner. With his Brylcreemed blond hair and those trademark gnashers \u2013 larger than average, though smaller in real life \u2013 he has an air of relatability. It\u2019s a winning combination, which has seen him swiftly join the ranks of Michael McIntyre, Jon Richardson and Jack Whitehall as one of those TV comics-cum-hosts we seem to see more often than our own families. Although he sounds as if he could have been genetically engineered by TV commissioners, Beckett is quite real. He doesn\u2019t mix too much with the celeb crowd \u2013 though he has, he says proudly, become pals with Martine McCutcheon, who lives close to him. He\u2019s still based in London, near to the suburb, Mottingham, where he and his four brothers grew up. His is a big, happy, working-class family, providing Beckett with much of his early material \u2013 including a bit about how he much preferred eating dinner off his lap and watching You\u2019ve Been Framed at his folks\u2019 house to talking politics in his girlfriend\u2019s family\u2019s conservatory. He studied tourism management at Canterbury Christ Church University (\u201cit was the Blair years, everyone went\u201d) before moving back home, working in a pub, flogging bags of compost alongside one of his brothers at Columbia Road flower market in London, and eventually temping in an office. Inspired by a range of comics from Peter Kay to Eddie Murphy, Beckett tentatively ventured to open mic nights and competitions in London, and was soon gigging five nights a week. \u201cIt was just a hobby that got out of hand, basically,\u201d he explains.

John Malkovich and Rowan Atkinson being reduced to appearing in light-hearted spy flick Johnny English? My sides!! Lee Evans? I can\u2019t spake!!! Now, a bit like Will Hughes on a Watford pre-season tour to the Algarve, The Fiver is feeling the heat. There are actual funny things to compete against now, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/series/david-squires-on\">David Squires</a>, the drawn-out <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/oct/08/manchester-united-problems-ole-gunnar-solskjaer\">demise of Manchester United</a> and only last month, the memory of Lionesses manager Phil Neville pondering the \u201cflattering\u201d idea of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/03/phil-neville-england-us-manager-flattering\">replacing Jill Ellis</a> as manager of current World Cup champions USA! USA!! USA!!!</p> \n<p>Things, you see, have gone pretty badly for Big Phil since that little carrot came out, with England five games without a win (including four defeats) after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/05/england-women-brazil-friendly-international-match-report\">Saturday\u2019s 2-1 defeat at home to Brazil</a>, which is the same number of non-victories it took for the FA to smuggle Hope Powell out of their dressing room via a laundry basket marked Do One, back in 2013. If England fail to beat Portugal \u2013 a nation ranked 26 places below them \u2013 under pressure Nev might end up less Ellis, more Hope and solo.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/07/phil-neville-would-leave-england-if-it-was-right-lionesses\">Phil Neville says he would leave Lionesses \u2018if it was the right thing to do\u2019</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel vulnerable at all,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/07/phil-neville-would-leave-england-if-it-was-right-lionesses\">he shivered</a>. \u201cI was a coach at Manchester United and four games after the manager [David Moyes] got sacked I left because it was the right thing to do,\u201d he added, skilfully reminding everyone that he was also part of a management team that constantly chose the wrong things to do. \u201cIf I thought the players weren\u2019t listening to my messages, I would be the first to go and sit with Sue Campbell [the FA\u2019s head of women\u2019s football] and say: \u2018Look Sue, we need to change,\u2019 because ultimately the most important thing is the team.\u201d</p> \n<p>That\u2019s more like it. Wholesome, hypothetical gestures that depend more on Big Phil\u2019s interpretation of apathy and less on actual reality, like that time he thought it would be a good idea to replicate Gareth Southgate\u2019s exact World Cup wardrobe. Even if support for him appears to be waning, the nation is still firmly behind the team, with Saturday\u2019s crowd of 29,238 in Middlesbrough a record attendance for a women\u2019s international in England staged outside Wembley, which will itself welcome <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/01/england-women-to-break-attendance-record-lionesses\">a record figure through its gates</a> for next month\u2019s game against Germany.

      "body": "<p>Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!\u201d David Hasselhoff chants as he snakes his way through the Max-Schmeling-Halle, a basketball stadium erected near where a section of the Berlin Wall once stood. It\u2019s German Unity Day, Thursday 3 October, and Hasselhoff is here to promote his 14th album Open Your Eyes. The date is no coincidence.</p> <p>As the show begins, the actor and singer is raised on a hydraulic platform above the crowd, and it\u2019s hard not to recall how, on New Year\u2019s Eve 1989 \u2013 less than two months after the Wall fell \u2013 he was similarly lifted beside the city\u2019s Brandenburg Gate in a bucket crane. \u201cThirty years of freedom!\u201d Hasselhoff yells today, adding, in a nod to John F Kennedy\u2019s 1963 speech, \u201cIch bin ein Berliner!\u201d</p> <p>On that December night almost 30 years ago, in a televised performance that never seems far from his mind, Hasselhoff sang Looking for Freedom, a song that held West Germany\u2019s No 1 slot for two months during the tumultuous summer that led to the momentous East-West reunion. As the Knight Rider star mugged for the camera, Germans from both sides of the border sat astride the hated barricade. Some tossed fireworks dangerously close to Hasselhoff, his leather jacket illuminated by the sparks. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking for freedom,\u201d he insisted, over and over again, \u201cI\u2019ve been looking so long.\u201d</p> <p>Hasselhoff was still clinging to his anthem the last time I saw him, grinning beneath his trademark coiffure at Berlin\u2019s East Side Gallery. It was March 2013 and he was protesting developers\u2019 intentions to dismantle some of the open-air gallery, which consists of murals on a stretch of the Wall, singing the song a cappella \u2013 repeatedly \u2013 through a PA strapped to a battered yellow van\u00ad. This was a campaign to which he\u2019d stay loyal: in December 2017, he called again on the city\u2019s mayor to halt construction of luxury flats on what was once the \u201cdeath strip\u201d alongside the River Spree. (Nonetheless, the building went ahead.) For many, this provoked amusement, as Hasselhoff\u2019s actions often do. Most famous in Germany for a kitsch celebration of the Wall\u2019s demolition, he was now battling to keep it standing.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNpCn0nAlR0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SNpCn0nAlR0?start=56&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=56\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>To justify his presence at Max-Schmeling-Halle tonight \u2013 as if it needs justification \u2013 Hasselhoff offers his resum\u00e9 before the show. Songs from the new album, as well as his hits, play over the PA while most people are still coming through the doors. A replica of KITT, his talking-car co-star, stands behind the sound desk, and clips of Knight Rider and Baywatch \u2013 as well as videos for his many German pop hits \u2013 are beamed behind the stage before his show gets under way.</p> <p>Then for the best part of three hours, he hammers out, with almost unceasing force, a series of cover versions that makes as little sense as his German fame does to the British. An improbably convincing cover of the Jesus and Mary Chain\u2019s Head On is followed by one of Modern English\u2019s I Melt With You. He perches on a stool for Glen Campbell\u2019s Rhinestone Cowboy, then vigorously owns the pomp of Open Your Eyes by gothic rockers Lords of the New Church. He dons his Baywatch uniform, wielding an inflatable buoy, for theme tune I\u2019m Always Here, then continues with a Rat Pack standard. When he lifts his shirt to reveal a back tattoo of his own face and the legend \u201cDon\u2019t Hassle the Hoff\u201d, the crowd\u2019s squeals are punctuated with disbelieving splutters.</p> <p>He also offers constant, gushing reminders that we\u2019re commemorating \u201cThirty years! Thirty years of freedom!\u201d, something he seems to be taking more seriously than Berliners, for whom time has passed as fast as rents have risen. Memories of the Wall have been chipped away at, just as the edifice itself was, before it was then sold in fragments to tourists. These days Berlin celebrates this annual public holiday mostly for the simple reason that it\u2019s one of only nine granted to the city. (Bavaria, in contrast, has 13.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"aa2d98851c3bda2c1dd42c5f61548ff32e470ee3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa2d98851c3bda2c1dd42c5f61548ff32e470ee3/0_0_2145_2769/775.jpg\" alt=\"David Hasselhoff in his Baywatch heyday.\" width=\"775\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Hasselhoff in his Baywatch heyday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/NBC/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Indeed, despite a handful of official festivities, the most prominent Unity Day events this year were demonstrations concerning the capital\u2019s rather more immediate problems: widespread gentrification, with its subsequent spikes in housing costs; the growth of far-right extremism across the country, evident in a march involving 1,700 extremists, neo-Nazis and anti-Islamic German Defence League members, with counter-protesters numbering 2,000. Hasselhoff makes no mention of such issues.</p> <p>In fact, Hasselhoff doesn\u2019t seem to have moved on at all, something reflected in his music. This is what provokes his critics as much as his enthusiasts: to some he\u2019s an embarrassing, outdated reminder of the profligate, superficial nature of much of western culture, while to others he\u2019s emblematic of a coveted future and a goal achieved. He\u2019s a symbol of unresolved conflicts, something with which Berlin is familiar.</p> <p>As a globally recognisable star of huge shows \u2013 in 2011 Guinness World Records named him \u201cthe most watched man on TV\u201d \u2013 he also provokes snobbery from those who consider themselves more cerebral, although it was he who recognised Baywatch\u2019s commercial potential and invested his own money in the series when it was prematurely cancelled after its first season. He\u2019s been releasing critically derided albums since 1985, some of which have nonetheless hit the top spots in Austria and Switzerland as well as Germany \u2013 even 2013\u2019s A Real Good Feeling made the latter\u2019s Top 30 \u2013 but prominent roles in musicals like Chicago, Jekyll &amp; Hyde and The Producers, for which he was personally selected by Mel Brooks, have done little to restore his credibility.</p> <p>Few, though, are as earnest about Hasselhoff\u2019s work as he is, and this includes his fans. During an unnecessary \u2013 and lengthy \u2013 interval, I ask two of them whether they take him seriously. Their response is amusingly ambivalent, and when I query whether <em>he</em> takes himself seriously, their reply is equally equivocal. \u201cProbably,\u201d they reply, adding, \u201chopefully not.\u201d This, of course, suits a man who sometimes betrays an unusual self-awareness, as appearances in The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story (in which he plays the German team\u2019s coach) and the droll mockumentary Hoff the Record \u2013 not to mention Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No! \u2013 attest. In February this year, he published an audiobook, Up Against The Wall \u2013 set, of course, in autumn 1989 \u2013 in which he juggles performing to 100,000 people and saving Berlin from nuclear attack with the help of a doppelg\u00e4nger CIA agent stationed in east Berlin. \u201cIs this the greatest thing you can ever listen to?\u201d one reader asks on Goodreads. \u201cI\u2019m saying, \u2018Probably\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>But at other times he appears to be the only person not in on the joke. When he tears into True Survivor (the theme tune to cult Swedish time-travel-martial-arts-action-comedy Kung Fury, a short film in which he had a cameo role as \u201cHoff 9000\u201d), it\u2019s so beefed up it sounds like an immaculate parody of 80s hair-synth-rock. He plays it straight, and it\u2019s this inappropriate sincerity that makes him an easy object of derision.</p> <p>But his fans are conscious of his absurdity and some, at least, are protective of Looking for Freedom. One local friend, who grew up in the 80s, explained to me that, back then, Hasselhoff and his biggest hit represented \u201cthe <em>sehnsucht </em>[wistful longing] for western culture and the weird word \u2018freedom\u2019, embodied in a two-metre-tall, leather-clad, chest-haired dude \u2013 and, more importantly, a very catchy song that every kid was singing in school\u201d. Explained like that, his status becomes more intelligible, and its longevity more sympathetic. Hasselhoff was in the right place at the right time, for which some will always be appreciative, and they remember Looking for Freedom with the same degree of respect as the English do Three Lions. Perhaps both make recollections of what went before, and what came after, less painful.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/mar/19/david-hasselhoff-berlin-wall-fall\">David Hasselhoff's role in the fall of the Berlin Wall | Emma Hartley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In Let\u2019s Talk About Love: Why Other People Have Such Bad Taste \u2013 a critical consideration of the meaning of taste, as seen through the lens of C\u00e9line Dion\u2019s career \u2013 critic Carl Wilson wonders \u201cwhether \u2018easier\u2019 music might contain hints for reconciliation with the world into which we\u2019re already thrown. Maybe it deals with problems that don\u2019t require leaps of the imagination but require other efforts, like patience, or compromise.\u201d Hasselhoff\u2019s audience seem familiar with both qualities, while cynics see things in less tolerant, more binary terms, rejecting him on purely aesthetic grounds. Reconciling these two viewpoints seems as much of a stretch of the imagination \u2013 especially when faced by Do the Limbo Dance, which tonight inspires a conga line through the stalls \u2013 as the idea of the Wall falling once did. But harmony is exactly what, on a smaller scale, the Hoff achieves. The arena is packed with people from across the social divide, and however much Hasselhoff is mocked outside its walls, here there are dreadlocks and mohawks, groups in matching Baywatch T-shirts, late middle-aged couples who\u2019ve come straight from dinner, and others who weren\u2019t even born when the Wall fell. Several fans even wear replicas of the jacket Hasselhoff donned in December 1989.</p> <p>For them, Hasselhoff is a reminder of an era when division seemed to have been overcome: a time when the world might come together. Indeed, if you listen to his selections, the wildly varied music is of less import than the lyrics. He convinces us that the preposterous Hot Shot City \u2013 \u201cYou will find her on the street / In her red Ferrari / With her top pulled down\u201d \u2013 is an anthem for Berlin, and employs Modern English to remind us to \u201cdream of better lives / The kind which never hates\u201d. Before Air Supply\u2019s Lonely Is the Night, he instructs us to introduce ourselves to the people next to us, \u201ceven if you know them\u201d, while the dramatic chorus of Open Your Eyes is spelled out on the screens behind him: \u201cSee the lies right in front of you.\u201d As for Sweet Caroline, its message is perfect for a man so desperate for us to be friends, not least with him: \u201cHands, touching hands / Reaching out, touching me, touching you\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e09e7d2eb8e6c74f8332000ca5eb2c90d463cbe5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e09e7d2eb8e6c74f8332000ca5eb2c90d463cbe5/0_0_5641_3761/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Hasselhoff performing at Max-Schmeling-Halle, Berlin, 3 October 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Hasselhoff performing at Max-Schmeling-Halle, Berlin, 3 October 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frank Hoensch/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s a message he communicates successfully, and it\u2019s especially poignant in Berlin. Tonight, we\u2019re a ragbag of people singing a ragbag of songs, remembering \u2013 or, in surprisingly plentiful cases, imagining \u2013 how it felt to be so full of hope. Frankly, it\u2019s a relief. This is perhaps what the Hoff wants of us, too: to love and forgive each other as much as he loves and forgives us \u2013 which is as much as he wants us to love and forgive him. If we can manage that here, maybe we can take that tolerance away with us afterwards. It\u2019s gauche, but nonetheless admirable and \u2013 if you drop your prejudices \u2013 rather bewitching. Hasselhoff is a recovering alcoholic, and one suspects that to him, as to many, this city is a symbol of how a \u201cdifferent\u201d lifestyle can flourish after even awful things have happened. A bit more of this compassion, however self-satisfying, might resolve many conflicts, not just his own.</p> <p>Whether he\u2019s taken seriously or not, Hasselhoff is a unifying force. He\u2019s contradictory, of course: he demands walls stay up which he once wanted torn down; he sings karaoke with a grubby Sunset Strip rock band like he\u2019s changing the world. But even when the Wall tumbled \u2013 as Tim Mohr\u2019s recent, gripping history of the 1980s East German punk scene, Burning Down the Haus, reminds us \u2013 there were plenty of anti-capitalist DDR citizens who rejected reunification and wished instead to see socialism remodelled. Contradictions are a part of life. Resolving them should be too.</p> <p>He brings things to a close, inevitably, with Looking for Freedom, and if you pay attention, you realise he understands that the thing about \u201clooking for freedom\u201d is that \u201cstill the search goes on\u201d. His relentless optimism is irresistible, and it\u2019s infectious, too. That he keeps persevering is to be applauded \u2013 as he is noisily tonight \u2013 and there is hope in how so many remain prepared to listen.</p>",

As the show begins, the actor and singer is raised on a hydraulic platform above the crowd, and it\u2019s hard not to recall how, on New Year\u2019s Eve 1989 \u2013 less than two months after the Wall fell \u2013 he was similarly lifted beside the city\u2019s Brandenburg Gate in a bucket crane. \u201cThirty years of freedom!\u201d Hasselhoff yells today, adding, in a nod to John F Kennedy\u2019s 1963 speech, \u201cIch bin ein Berliner!\u201d On that December night almost 30 years ago, in a televised performance that never seems far from his mind, Hasselhoff sang Looking for Freedom, a song that held West Germany\u2019s No 1 slot for two months during the tumultuous summer that led to the momentous East-West reunion. As the Knight Rider star mugged for the camera, Germans from both sides of the border sat astride the hated barricade. Some tossed fireworks dangerously close to Hasselhoff, his leather jacket illuminated by the sparks. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking for freedom,\u201d he insisted, over and over again, \u201cI\u2019ve been looking so long.\u201d Hasselhoff was still clinging to his anthem the last time I saw him, grinning beneath his trademark coiffure at Berlin\u2019s East Side Gallery. It was March 2013 and he was protesting developers\u2019 intentions to dismantle some of the open-air gallery, which consists of murals on a stretch of the Wall, singing the song a cappella \u2013 repeatedly \u2013 through a PA strapped to a battered yellow van. This was a campaign to which he\u2019d stay loyal: in December 2017, he called again on the city\u2019s mayor to halt construction of luxury flats on what was once the \u201cdeath strip\u201d alongside the River Spree. (Nonetheless, the building went ahead.) For many, this provoked amusement, as Hasselhoff\u2019s actions often do. Most famous in Germany for a kitsch celebration of the Wall\u2019s demolition, he was now battling to keep it standing. To justify his presence at Max-Schmeling-Halle tonight \u2013 as if it needs justification \u2013 Hasselhoff offers his resum\u00e9 before the show. Songs from the new album, as well as his hits, play over the PA while most people are still coming through the doors. A replica of KITT, his talking-car co-star, stands behind the sound desk, and clips of Knight Rider and Baywatch \u2013 as well as videos for his many German pop hits \u2013 are beamed behind the stage before his show gets under way. Then for the best part of three hours, he hammers out, with almost unceasing force, a series of cover versions that makes as little sense as his German fame does to the British. An improbably convincing cover of the Jesus and Mary Chain\u2019s Head On is followed by one of Modern English\u2019s I Melt With You. He perches on a stool for Glen Campbell\u2019s Rhinestone Cowboy, then vigorously owns the pomp of Open Your Eyes by gothic rockers Lords of the New Church. He dons his Baywatch uniform, wielding an inflatable buoy, for theme tune I\u2019m Always Here, then continues with a Rat Pack standard. When he lifts his shirt to reveal a back tattoo of his own face and the legend \u201cDon\u2019t Hassle the Hoff\u201d, the crowd\u2019s squeals are punctuated with disbelieving splutters. He also offers constant, gushing reminders that we\u2019re commemorating \u201cThirty years! Thirty years of freedom!\u201d, something he seems to be taking more seriously than Berliners, for whom time has passed as fast as rents have risen. Memories of the Wall have been chipped away at, just as the edifice itself was, before it was then sold in fragments to tourists. These days Berlin celebrates this annual public holiday mostly for the simple reason that it\u2019s one of only nine granted to the city. (Bavaria, in contrast, has 13.) Indeed, despite a handful of official festivities, the most prominent Unity Day events this year were demonstrations concerning the capital\u2019s rather more immediate problems: widespread gentrification, with its subsequent spikes in housing costs; the growth of far-right extremism across the country, evident in a march involving 1,700 extremists, neo-Nazis and anti-Islamic German Defence League members, with counter-protesters numbering 2,000. Hasselhoff makes no mention of such issues. In fact, Hasselhoff doesn\u2019t seem to have moved on at all, something reflected in his music. This is what provokes his critics as much as his enthusiasts: to some he\u2019s an embarrassing, outdated reminder of the profligate, superficial nature of much of western culture, while to others he\u2019s emblematic of a coveted future and a goal achieved. He\u2019s a symbol of unresolved conflicts, something with which Berlin is familiar. As a globally recognisable star of huge shows \u2013 in 2011 Guinness World Records named him \u201cthe most watched man on TV\u201d \u2013 he also provokes snobbery from those who consider themselves more cerebral, although it was he who recognised Baywatch\u2019s commercial potential and invested his own money in the series when it was prematurely cancelled after its first season. He\u2019s been releasing critically derided albums since 1985, some of which have nonetheless hit the top spots in Austria and Switzerland as well as Germany \u2013 even 2013\u2019s A Real Good Feeling made the latter\u2019s Top 30 \u2013 but prominent roles in musicals like Chicago, Jekyll &amp; Hyde and The Producers, for which he was personally selected by Mel Brooks, have done little to restore his credibility. Few, though, are as earnest about Hasselhoff\u2019s work as he is, and this includes his fans. During an unnecessary \u2013 and lengthy \u2013 interval, I ask two of them whether they take him seriously. Their response is amusingly ambivalent, and when I query whether he takes himself seriously, their reply is equally equivocal. \u201cProbably,\u201d they reply, adding, \u201chopefully not.\u201d This, of course, suits a man who sometimes betrays an unusual self-awareness, as appearances in The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story (in which he plays the German team\u2019s coach) and the droll mockumentary Hoff the Record \u2013 not to mention Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No! \u2013 attest. In February this year, he published an audiobook, Up Against The Wall \u2013 set, of course, in autumn 1989 \u2013 in which he juggles performing to 100,000 people and saving Berlin from nuclear attack with the help of a doppelg\u00e4nger CIA agent stationed in east Berlin. \u201cIs this the greatest thing you can ever listen to?\u201d one reader asks on Goodreads. \u201cI\u2019m saying, \u2018Probably\u2019.\u201d But at other times he appears to be the only person not in on the joke. When he tears into True Survivor (the theme tune to cult Swedish time-travel-martial-arts-action-comedy Kung Fury, a short film in which he had a cameo role as \u201cHoff 9000\u201d), it\u2019s so beefed up it sounds like an immaculate parody of 80s hair-synth-rock. He plays it straight, and it\u2019s this inappropriate sincerity that makes him an easy object of derision. But his fans are conscious of his absurdity and some, at least, are protective of Looking for Freedom. One local friend, who grew up in the 80s, explained to me that, back then, Hasselhoff and his biggest hit represented \u201cthe sehnsucht [wistful longing] for western culture and the weird word \u2018freedom\u2019, embodied in a two-metre-tall, leather-clad, chest-haired dude \u2013 and, more importantly, a very catchy song that every kid was singing in school\u201d. Explained like that, his status becomes more intelligible, and its longevity more sympathetic. Hasselhoff was in the right place at the right time, for which some will always be appreciative, and they remember Looking for Freedom with the same degree of respect as the English do Three Lions. Perhaps both make recollections of what went before, and what came after, less painful. In Let\u2019s Talk About Love: Why Other People Have Such Bad Taste \u2013 a critical consideration of the meaning of taste, as seen through the lens of C\u00e9line Dion\u2019s career \u2013 critic Carl Wilson wonders \u201cwhether \u2018easier\u2019 music might contain hints for reconciliation with the world into which we\u2019re already thrown. Maybe it deals with problems that don\u2019t require leaps of the imagination but require other efforts, like patience, or compromise.\u201d Hasselhoff\u2019s audience seem familiar with both qualities, while cynics see things in less tolerant, more binary terms, rejecting him on purely aesthetic grounds. Reconciling these two viewpoints seems as much of a stretch of the imagination \u2013 especially when faced by Do the Limbo Dance, which tonight inspires a conga line through the stalls \u2013 as the idea of the Wall falling once did. But harmony is exactly what, on a smaller scale, the Hoff achieves. The arena is packed with people from across the social divide, and however much Hasselhoff is mocked outside its walls, here there are dreadlocks and mohawks, groups in matching Baywatch T-shirts, late middle-aged couples who\u2019ve come straight from dinner, and others who weren\u2019t even born when the Wall fell. Several fans even wear replicas of the jacket Hasselhoff donned in December 1989. For them, Hasselhoff is a reminder of an era when division seemed to have been overcome: a time when the world might come together. Indeed, if you listen to his selections, the wildly varied music is of less import than the lyrics. He convinces us that the preposterous Hot Shot City \u2013 \u201cYou will find her on the street / In her red Ferrari / With her top pulled down\u201d \u2013 is an anthem for Berlin, and employs Modern English to remind us to \u201cdream of better lives / The kind which never hates\u201d. Before Air Supply\u2019s Lonely Is the Night, he instructs us to introduce ourselves to the people next to us, \u201ceven if you know them\u201d, while the dramatic chorus of Open Your Eyes is spelled out on the screens behind him: \u201cSee the lies right in front of you.\u201d As for Sweet Caroline, its message is perfect for a man so desperate for us to be friends, not least with him: \u201cHands, touching hands / Reaching out, touching me, touching you\u201d. It\u2019s a message he communicates successfully, and it\u2019s especially poignant in Berlin. Tonight, we\u2019re a ragbag of people singing a ragbag of songs, remembering \u2013 or, in surprisingly plentiful cases, imagining \u2013 how it felt to be so full of hope. Frankly, it\u2019s a relief. This is perhaps what the Hoff wants of us, too: to love and forgive each other as much as he loves and forgives us \u2013 which is as much as he wants us to love and forgive him. If we can manage that here, maybe we can take that tolerance away with us afterwards. It\u2019s gauche, but nonetheless admirable and \u2013 if you drop your prejudices \u2013 rather bewitching. Hasselhoff is a recovering alcoholic, and one suspects that to him, as to many, this city is a symbol of how a \u201cdifferent\u201d lifestyle can flourish after even awful things have happened. A bit more of this compassion, however self-satisfying, might resolve many conflicts, not just his own. Whether he\u2019s taken seriously or not, Hasselhoff is a unifying force. He\u2019s contradictory, of course: he demands walls stay up which he once wanted torn down; he sings karaoke with a grubby Sunset Strip rock band like he\u2019s changing the world. But even when the Wall tumbled \u2013 as Tim Mohr\u2019s recent, gripping history of the 1980s East German punk scene, Burning Down the Haus, reminds us \u2013 there were plenty of anti-capitalist DDR citizens who rejected reunification and wished instead to see socialism remodelled. Contradictions are a part of life. Resolving them should be too. He brings things to a close, inevitably, with Looking for Freedom, and if you pay attention, you realise he understands that the thing about \u201clooking for freedom\u201d is that \u201cstill the search goes on\u201d. His relentless optimism is irresistible, and it\u2019s infectious, too. That he keeps persevering is to be applauded \u2013 as he is noisily tonight \u2013 and there is hope in how so many remain prepared to listen.",

      "body": "<p>The world came together last week for the UN general assembly, and climate crisis was high on the agenda. Many of the discussions focused on changing the energy and transport sectors to mitigate potential catastrophe. Climate activist Greta Thunberg traveled to New York on an emissions-free yacht to deliver her speech at the UN climate summit. The point of her journey was to raise awareness that transatlantic flights generate significant greenhouse gases. That message is getting across: people are putting limits on the number of flights they take each year to conferences, workshops and holidays.</p> <p>What was not high on the agenda was the impact food systems have on greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental degradation. A <a href=\"https://eatforum.org/eat-lancet-commission/\">slew of high-level reports</a> produced over the last few months all argue that if the world is to make an impact on climate crisis, the food system needs to be radically reshaped.</p> <p>The way we produce food, the way food is manipulated and moved around the world, and what we as citizens decide to put on our plate, matter for the climate crisis. Food systems contribute <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2019/08/2f.-Chapter-5_FINAL.pdf\">21% to 37%</a> of global greenhouse gases, and are significant contributors to deforestation, biodiversity loss and declining water tables. The Amazon forest fires in Brazil are directly related one way or another to food production.</p> <p>Perhaps the biggest problem: livestock. They <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/3/ar591e/ar591e.pdf\">use</a> a third of global cropland and contribute 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions. A recent New Yorker <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/09/30/can-a-burger-help-solve-climate-change\">article</a> noted that \u201c[every] 4lbs of beef you eat contributes to as much global warming as flying from New York to London \u2013 and the average American eats that much each month.\u201d</p> <p>While red meat is generally considered the most resource-intensive food on the planet, the factors that determine whether a given meat is sustainable are complicated. Meat production can be environmentally friendly and efficient when it uses lands of low-opportunity costs, not suitable for crop production or significant carbon sequestration. Meat production can also be efficient in intensive, high-welfare animal systems like free-range pork and poultry. It can be more environmentally friendly when it uses feed that does not compete with human food.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Every four pounds of beef you eat contributes to as much global warming as flying from New York to London</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As producers embrace new technologies to ensure animal systems are sustainable, we can make our own personal changes. Many people eat more red and processed meat than they need to, and there remains a lot of confusion about the health and environmental impacts of consuming meat. Red meat consumption per capita has been static since the 1990s. In contrast, we see a rapid growth in consumption per capita for pork and poultry (up to 300% in places in the last 25 years).</p> <p>The sheer growth of the world\u2019s population is driving the increased demand for animal source foods. Some countries consume very high levels of red meat, such as those in the <a href=\"http://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/oecd-countries/\">OECD</a> and Latin America; other countries have very low consumption levels, such as many parts of Africa and south Asia. Still, consumption is low in low-income countries in comparison to high-income countries.</p> <p>The IPCC and Eat-Lancet reports recommend that those who consume high amounts of meat consider a \u201cflexitarian\u201d diet. This diet is largely composed of vegetables and fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts and unsaturated oils. It includes high-quality meat, dairy and sugar, but in quantities far lower than are currently consumed in wealthier societies.</p> <p>How should consumers make the shift?

      "bodyText": "The world came together last week for the UN general assembly, and climate crisis was high on the agenda. Many of the discussions focused on changing the energy and transport sectors to mitigate potential catastrophe. Climate activist Greta Thunberg traveled to New York on an emissions-free yacht to deliver her speech at the UN climate summit. The point of her journey was to raise awareness that transatlantic flights generate significant greenhouse gases. That message is getting across: people are putting limits on the number of flights they take each year to conferences, workshops and holidays. What was not high on the agenda was the impact food systems have on greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental degradation. A slew of high-level reports produced over the last few months all argue that if the world is to make an impact on climate crisis, the food system needs to be radically reshaped. The way we produce food, the way food is manipulated and moved around the world, and what we as citizens decide to put on our plate, matter for the climate crisis. Food systems contribute 21% to 37% of global greenhouse gases, and are significant contributors to deforestation, biodiversity loss and declining water tables. The Amazon forest fires in Brazil are directly related one way or another to food production. Perhaps the biggest problem: livestock. They use a third of global cropland and contribute 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions. A recent New Yorker article noted that \u201c[every] 4lbs of beef you eat contributes to as much global warming as flying from New York to London \u2013 and the average American eats that much each month.\u201d While red meat is generally considered the most resource-intensive food on the planet, the factors that determine whether a given meat is sustainable are complicated. Meat production can be environmentally friendly and efficient when it uses lands of low-opportunity costs, not suitable for crop production or significant carbon sequestration. Meat production can also be efficient in intensive, high-welfare animal systems like free-range pork and poultry. It can be more environmentally friendly when it uses feed that does not compete with human food. As producers embrace new technologies to ensure animal systems are sustainable, we can make our own personal changes. Many people eat more red and processed meat than they need to, and there remains a lot of confusion about the health and environmental impacts of consuming meat. Red meat consumption per capita has been static since the 1990s. In contrast, we see a rapid growth in consumption per capita for pork and poultry (up to 300% in places in the last 25 years). The sheer growth of the world\u2019s population is driving the increased demand for animal source foods. Some countries consume very high levels of red meat, such as those in the OECD and Latin America; other countries have very low consumption levels, such as many parts of Africa and south Asia. Still, consumption is low in low-income countries in comparison to high-income countries. The IPCC and Eat-Lancet reports recommend that those who consume high amounts of meat consider a \u201cflexitarian\u201d diet. This diet is largely composed of vegetables and fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts and unsaturated oils. It includes high-quality meat, dairy and sugar, but in quantities far lower than are currently consumed in wealthier societies. How should consumers make the shift? People could consider being a vegetarian by day and allow themselves small servings of animal source foods in the evening; go meatless on Mondays, as some schools and institutions already have; embrace tasty Asian cuisines, which tend to be more plant-based; or try out alternative plant protein options such as the Impossible Burger or Beyond Burger. Start with kids \u2013 school meals are a great way to form healthy and sustainable habits early on. Learn where your food (and meat) comes from. Who produced it and how? Support food producers who make efforts to produce low-impact meats. If you are going to go for red meat, choose quality over quantity: eat more meat cuts and less processed meat. And waste nothing. But for the world to make this shift, we need governments and the food industry to make it easier. We need investment in public health information and the implementation of policies that promote healthy eating that is affordable, safe, convenient and most of all, tasty. What we eat matters. Not only for ourselves and the planet, but for the youth who were out marching on the streets last week in the name of their future and right to live on this planet.

The report, created after two months of no-deal preparations accelerated and intensified after Boris Johnson became the prime minister, offers a one-stop summary of the impact of crashing out of the EU on trade, immigration, Northern Ireland and many other issues. It also reveals new detail on what the government plans for the Irish border and employing EU citizens after 31 October. Northern Ireland The government discloses it will operate a \u201cno new checks with limited exceptions\u201d policy on the Irish border in the event of no deal. It says it will introduce \u201cnecessary changes in legislation\u201d before 31 October to apply the new approach, but it does not give details on what the limited exceptions could be. It recognises the policy involves \u201csignificant risks\u201d as it is \u201ctemporary in nature and unilateral\u201d. It says the UK will \u201clook to engage with the Irish government and the EU as soon as possible following Brexit\u201d. The report is conspicuously light on detail for farmers and other small businesses, which rely heavily on moving animals, agri-food and other goods across the border into Ireland.

It also reconfirms its commitment to the common travel area, allowing British and Irish citizens to enjoy equal rights on both islands \u201ceven in the event of leaving without a deal\u201d. People holding a UK driving licence will need a motor insurance green card if they are taking a UK-registered vehicle into Ireland, something that will impact on the thousands of Irish-heritage families in Britain who spend their holidays in the Republic. People living in border areas might incur roaming charges on their mobile phone bills, something that was done away with several years ago as part of an all-island telecommunications policy. EU citizens currently in the UK The report says Brexit will end free movement of people, allowing the government to \u201cboost the labour market\u201d through a \u201cfairer immigration system\u201d based on skills and talent. It restates its commitment to EU citizens who \u201cwill continue to be able to work, study and access benefits and services such as the NHS\u201d on the same basis after 31 October. EU citizens wishing to remain in the country have until 31 December 2020 to apply for settled status. Some 1.5 million EU citizens have already been granted settled status and 1.7 million have already applied. EU citizens entering the UK after 31 October A new scheme, called European temporary leave to remain, will be introduced for EU citizens who want to settle in the UK after 31 October. From January 2021 the government will introduce an Australian-style points based system that will apply to all EU citizens newly entering the country. \u201cEU citizens moving to the UK if we leave without a deal on 31 October 2019 will be able to work, study and access benefits and services in the same way as EU citizens resident before exit day. \u201cHowever, to remain in the UK after 2020 they will be able to apply for European Temporary Leave to Remain (Euro TLR) which will last three years,\u201d it says. The paper makes it plain that employers will be expected to look to employ and train up workers locally. EU citizens visiting the UK after Brexit may have to get health insurance if current reciprocal arrangements, through the European health insurance card, do not survive after Brexit. There are also clear instructions for employers. Up to 2021 employers will not need to distinguish between EU citizens with settled status and those without, or to distinguish between EU citizens who are already entitled to live in the country and new arrivals. \u201cIn the interim, EU citizens will be able to evidence their right to live and work in the UK by using valid EU passport or national identity card, as now.\u201d Border Planes will continue to fly. But trains and coach journeys may be affected. Trade Trade will be heavily affected. In a no-deal scenario, the UK and the EU will trade on World Trade Organization terms. For the first time in 50 years the UK will be able to \u201carticulate\u201d its \u201cown voice\u201d in the WTO and set its own tariffs, the report claims. Exporters to the EU should check the additional paperwork required by the EU and ensure they are ready. Hauliers should explain to drivers that a customs export declaration (P2P) must be completed before they will be allowed to progress on a ferry journey to the EU. The driver should check with the trader that the goods have received the P2P from HMRC before going across the border. Those in the fishing industry will need to fill out catch certificates for all exports and potentially three other additional documents to fulfil EU laws. Hauliers can refer to a checklist of must-dos provided by the government. The chapter also runs through the many other requirements, such as the \u00a310 permit required by UK hauliers on export routes, and challenges that could disrupt cross-border trains and coach services. Importers will need to pay tariffs on a range of goods including meat, dairy produce and clothing. The government finalised its tariff schedule on Tuesday 8 October with just three changes to the tariff schedule published in March. Exporters will also face hefty tariffs overnight for goods sold in the EU and to other countries where there is no deal. In a no-deal Brexit this will include the 52 countries which already have a deal with the EU. The paper says the government \u201cis working intensively to deliver continuity\u201d on EU trade but warns that the EU\u2019s common external tariff will apply on 60% of the UK\u2019s exports to the EU. In some sectors such as life sciences and electronics, the effect of these taxes will be \u201cminor\u201d but, in what farmers will consider an understatement, it says \u201cother sectors will be more affected\u201d with, for example, tariffs of 65% on boneless beef and 53% on fresh bone-in lamb. Services UK companies and British citizens living in the EU who rely solely on EU rights to work, will no longer be able to provide services on the same terms in the event of no deal. In practice this means companies exporting services, which have not established a legal entity elsewhere in the bloc, will not be able to continue to do so. Britons living in the EU who trade services such as accountancy, translation services and architecture will not be able to continue to do so outside the country of their residence unless they have acquired such a right through alternative routes such as citizenship. Data Anyone trading or storing data in the EU faces immediate consequences in a no deal. This includes police, hotels, businesses, social media companies, transport and tech companies. The report states that the government intends to bring the general data protection regulation (GDPR) that governs data in the EU into domestic law. But as this will not happen overnight and the EU is not making an exception, \u201corganisations receiving personal data from the EU/EEA need to make alternative legal arrangements\u201d, it says. The government is continuing to press for the EU to change its mind and grant the UK an exemption if Britain leaves without a deal, the report adds.",

The prisons minister, Lucy Frazer, announced on Tuesday that she had instructed the prisons and probation ombudsman (PPO) to carry out an overarching independent review into the circumstances of the baby\u2019s death. A further 10 investigations are under way, including internal reviews at the privately run HMP Bronzefield in Surrey, an NHS clinical review, an inquest and two police investigations.

Next week we will release our world economic outlook which will show downward revisions for 2019 and 2020.\u201d</p> <p>The IMF has become steadily more pessimistic about the health of the global economy since 2017, when it was confident that a sustained and synchronised recovery from the financial crisis was at last under way.</p> <p>Georgieva said the outlook had darkened owing to a series of \u201cfractures\u201d \u2013 trade disputes, geopolitical tensions and Brexit among them. Tackling climate change, terrorism and money laundering all required cooperation, she said.</p> <p>Amid reports that talks between the US and China to end their tit-for-tat protectionist battle <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2019/oct/08/recruitment-firms-warn-profits-brexit-imf-global-economy-business-live?page=with:block-5d9c64d28f081108db9c4414#block-5d9c64d28f081108db9c4414\">were going badly</a>, the IMF managing director said global trade had come to a near standstill.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone loses in a trade war. For the global economy, the cumulative effect of trade conflicts could mean a loss of around $700bn by 2020, or about 0.8% of GDP. As a reference, this is approximately the size of Switzerland\u2019s entire economy.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cUncertainty, driven by trade, but also by Brexit, and geopolitical tensions, is holding back economic potential. Even if growth picks up in 2020, the current rifts could lead to changes that last a generation: broken supply chains, siloed trade sectors, a \u2018digital Berlin Wall\u2019 that forces countries to choose between technology systems.\u201d</p> <p>Georgieva said low inflation and weak growth meant it was right for central banks to keep interest rates low, but stressed that borrowing costs were already near zero or negative in many advanced countries, leaving limited scope for further cuts.</p> <p>\u201cProlonged low rates also come with negative side-effects and unintended consequences. Think of pension funds and life insurance companies that are taking on more risky investments to meet their return objectives,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cIn some countries, firms are using low rates and building up debt to fund mergers and acquisitions instead of investing.

      "bodyText": "The new head of the International Monetary Fund has told squabbling nations to forget their differences and prepare a united response to the most serious threat to the global economy since the financial crisis a decade ago. In her first speech since becoming the IMF\u2019s managing director, Kristalina Georgieva said the world was in a synchronised slowdown and needed a synchronised response. Speaking ahead of the IMF\u2019s annual meeting in Washington next week, Georgieva said her organisation\u2019s economists were expecting slower growth in nearly 90% of the global economy this year. \u201cWhile the need for international cooperation is going up, the will to engage is going down.\u201d She said the use of low interest rates by central banks in an attempt to boost activity had led to a buildup of corporate debt and that there would be a risk of a $19tn (\u00a315.5tn) default in the event of a major economic downturn. \u201cThe global economy is now in a synchronised slowdown,\u201d Georgieva said. \u201cThis widespread deceleration means that growth this year will fall to its lowest rate since the beginning of the decade. Next week we will release our world economic outlook which will show downward revisions for 2019 and 2020.\u201d The IMF has become steadily more pessimistic about the health of the global economy since 2017, when it was confident that a sustained and synchronised recovery from the financial crisis was at last under way. Georgieva said the outlook had darkened owing to a series of \u201cfractures\u201d \u2013 trade disputes, geopolitical tensions and Brexit among them. Tackling climate change, terrorism and money laundering all required cooperation, she said. Amid reports that talks between the US and China to end their tit-for-tat protectionist battle were going badly, the IMF managing director said global trade had come to a near standstill. \u201cEveryone loses in a trade war. For the global economy, the cumulative effect of trade conflicts could mean a loss of around $700bn by 2020, or about 0.8% of GDP. As a reference, this is approximately the size of Switzerland\u2019s entire economy.\u201d She added: \u201cUncertainty, driven by trade, but also by Brexit, and geopolitical tensions, is holding back economic potential. Even if growth picks up in 2020, the current rifts could lead to changes that last a generation: broken supply chains, siloed trade sectors, a \u2018digital Berlin Wall\u2019 that forces countries to choose between technology systems.\u201d Georgieva said low inflation and weak growth meant it was right for central banks to keep interest rates low, but stressed that borrowing costs were already near zero or negative in many advanced countries, leaving limited scope for further cuts. \u201cProlonged low rates also come with negative side-effects and unintended consequences. Think of pension funds and life insurance companies that are taking on more risky investments to meet their return objectives,\u201d she said. \u201cIn some countries, firms are using low rates and building up debt to fund mergers and acquisitions instead of investing. Our new analysis shows that if a major downturn occurs, corporate debt at risk of default would rise to $19tn, or nearly 40% of the total debt in eight major economies. This is above the levels seen during the financial crisis. Low interest rates are also prompting investors to search for higher yields in emerging markets. This leaves many smaller economies exposed to a sudden reversal of capital flows.\u201d Georgieva said it was time for countries to use higher public spending and tax cuts as an alternative way of stimulating growth. \u201cNow is the time for countries with room in their budgets to deploy, or get ready to deploy, fiscal firepower. In fact, low interest rates may give some policymakers additional money to spend,\u201d Georgieva said, singling out Germany, the Netherlands and South Korea as nations that could increase spending on infrastructure and research and development, which would boost economic activity. But, she said, \u201cthat advice will not work everywhere. Globally, public debt is near record levels. So in countries with a high debt-to-GDP ratio, fiscal restraint continues to be warranted.\u201d The IMF will release its latest economic forecasts next week but Georgieva stressed a coordinated fiscal response could be needed if activity slowed more sharply than expected.",

The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman declared \u201cwe do not support the action\u201d Turkey had said it was preparing, and said Dominic Raab had complained about the US decision in a phone call on Monday night with Trump\u2019s secretary of state, Mike Pompeo. The hardening of the UK position emerged as MPs debated the Syrian crisis in the Commons, where Andrew Murrison, a junior Foreign Office minister, repeatedly said the UK was opposed to an anticipated Turkish offensive. \u201cWe have been consistently clear with Turkey that unilateral military action must be avoided as it would destabilise the region and threaten efforts to secure the lasting defeat of Daesh,\u201d Murrison told MPs. The junior minister said the situation was \u201cin the diplomatic space\u201d when asked what actions the UK was taking by Crispin Blunt, a Conservative former chairman of the foreign affairs select committee. \u201cThis is a dynamic situation and we have to respond to whatever happens,\u201d Murrison added. The threat of a Turkish offensive marks the end of a US-Turkish arrangement established in August under which troops from both countries carried out joint patrols in a \u201csafe zone\u201d along the border keeping Turkish and Kurdish forces apart. The safe zone deal was due to forestall a Turkish military offensive that has been threatened since Trump announced last December the 2,000 US special forces stationed in Syria would leave. Ankara sees the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces as indistinguishable from Kurdish insurgents inside Turkey and views them as a serious security threat. Kurdish forces have spearheaded the campaign against Islamic State in the region and are regarded as some of the west\u2019s most loyal and effective allies. What was initially a Kurdish force of ground troops with air and logistical support from a US-led coalition has expanded into an administration controlling 30% of Syria east of the Euphrates River. Kurdish-run north-east Syria is the largest part of the country outside the control of President Bashar al-Assad. Condemnation of Trump\u2019s announcement and the prospective Turkish invasion was near universal in the Commons, where the minister was responding to an urgent question brought by the Tory former defence minister Tobias Ellwood. Emily Thornberry, Labour\u2019s foreign affairs spokesperson, said Trump\u2019s decision would \u201copen the door to a Turkish invasion of Syria and the subjugation of the Kurdish people\u201d, who she said were \u201cthe very people who led the fight against Daesh [Islamic State]\u201d. Thornberry asked why the US president felt able to say on Monday night that \u201cthe UK is very thrilled\u201d at his decision to withdraw US troops, pressing him on what Raab had told his counterpart in last night\u2019s phone call. \u201cNo idea where that came from,\u201d Murrison replied. \u201cIt certainly isn\u2019t based upon the conversation that my right honourable friend [Raab] had with Secretary of State Pompeo last night\u201d. The minister later tried to downplay the effect of the US announcement, saying it involved only the withdrawal of 50 troops from the Syria-Turkey border, although Trump had repeatedly said his plan was to remove the 1,000 troops stationed in the Kurdish controlled part of Syria. Lloyd Russell-Moyle, a Labour backbencher who chairs the all-party parliamentary group on north-east Syria, called on the UK \u201cto suspend sharing any intelligence information with Turkey so they can\u2019t use it against one of our allies\u201d and provide further support to the Kurdish military, the Syrian Democratic Forces. Murrison did not respond to Russell-Moyle\u2019s specific requests, but said the UK had previously supported the SDF in the fight against Isis. The minister also would not say if the UK had any plans to escalate the crisis by asking for the issue to be discussed at either the UN security council or the North Atlantic Council, which governs Nato.",

The authors of the research, which is to be collated into a book published this year, say this context, plus the fact that Brexit will still be a live issue in the coming months, makes the likely imminent next election hugely difficult to call. \u201cGiven the UK\u2019s recent history of vote switching and the unpredictability of the current climate, it would be unwise for any political party or commentator to presume how voters will behave in a general election, particularly in the middle of an electoral shock,\u201d said Edward Fieldhouse, a politics professor at Manchester University. \u201cBut we do expect to see big shifts defined largely by Brexit.\u201d The idea of electoral shocks seeks to explain the extent of vote switching, which the researchers say goes beyond longer-term factors such as a gradual weakening in party loyalties, especially among new cohorts of younger voters. The study found that the 2017 election had the largest recorded amount of voter movement between the two big parties. One in eight Conservative voters from 2015 backed Labour, with one in 11 former Labour voters moving the other way. This totalled 11% of the electorate switching between the two parties. In contrast, during Tony Blair\u2019s landslide election win in 1997, the figure was 9%. The research suggests that the cumulative effect could be more volatility, as new electoral shocks shift already unattached voters. With the likelihood of a new departure extension before the next election, Brexit seems set to be a key factor \u2013 and one that is hard to predict. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what the Brexit situation will be on election day,\u201d said Jane Green, professor of politics at Oxford University. \u201cWe don\u2019t know who will get the blame for the current political deadlock, or who will benefit. \u201cBut we do expect there to be clear winners and losers because voters are now more changeable in response to such shock events. A key driver of vote choice will be how competent each party is perceived to be on Brexit.\u201d",

He had arrived at Heathrow airport, packed and ready for the 14-hour slog back to Phnom Penh, and at that point another season at the Cambodian club Svay Rieng felt like a trade-off he could just about stomach.

Because I\u2019m happy, I\u2019m progressing and showing it on the pitch.\u201d</p> \n<p>Willard scored 12 times in 22 league games last season, an impressive record for a winger, and was named in the division\u2019s team of the season. There is no kidding: this is not what he had imagined five years ago when, on his 17th birthday, he signed professional terms with Saints after showing the promise that would earn him a place on the Guardian\u2019s inaugural Next Generation list that year. But he feels he is regaining the momentum that was crudely halted in the manner so many young players endure each year.</p> \n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see it coming to be honest,\u201d he says of the day in May 2017 when the Premier League club cut him adrift. He was no longer a regular in the under-23s, for whom he had made his debut at 16, but he felt Claude Puel, the senior team\u2019s manager at the time, had taken a liking to him. \u201cIt was quite strange, but that\u2019s just how it is. The more I wasn\u2019t playing for the under-23s I was thinking: \u2018Maybe it\u2019s not going to work out,\u2019 but then the next day I\u2019d be training with the first team and the manager would be talking to me.

But obviously it\u2019s not as easy as that and when I got to 18 or 19 it was tough, I struggled. My family were so supportive but other people around me were negative and it wasn\u2019t the best.

      "bodyText": "Yesterday we at the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) published our report into certain elements of the Metropolitan police\u2019s Operation Midland, the investigation into an alleged VIP paedophile ring. Some chose to condemn that investigation even before the publication of the report. I understand that those who have suffered great injustices as a result of the lies told by Carl Beech are unhappy with our conclusions, but many of the comments made are inaccurate and appear to be based on misunderstandings of the role and remit of the IOPC. Our role was not to investigate all the assertions made in the review of the case by retired high court judge Richard Henriques. We did, of course, consider his findings and agree with many aspects of Henriques\u2019s review, but on some aspects we do not. We have never claimed to be a perfect organisation \u2013 indeed we are still working through many legacy issues, including improving timeliness of investigations. A concerted effort has seen a 20% improvement in the past 12 months with 80% of investigations now complete in under a year. Am I satisfied this investigation took so long? Far from it. But this was not a cursory investigation, nor was it run by a sole investigator, as some would suggest. Investigators from police and civilian backgrounds worked on this, backed by a team of lawyers and policy experts. They More than 1,800 documents and 300 statements were examined. Some of those unhappy with the outcome of our investigation have chosen to single out a member of our investigation team. These personal attacks on their experience are not only inaccurate, but unwarranted and uncalled for. The detail of our investigation is in the minutiae which does not readily lend itself to quick media soundbites. Suggestions we \u201coverlooked\u201d interviewing the officers we served misconduct notices on are simply wrong. All of the officers answered our questions. In relation to deputy assistant commissioner Steve Rodhouse and Det Supt Kenny McDonald, their actions in supervising the search warrant applications were assessed, and would not have met the threshold for misconduct. We cannot act outside the law. Henriques himself states in his report that he believed the officers conducted this investigation in a conscientious manner and with propriety and honesty. Yet at the same time he fervently believes they acted unlawfully. Which is true? Despite his assertions otherwise, we did not rely on this statement as the basis for our investigation. On the contrary, we took active steps to look for evidence which countered this view. Henriques states in his review he was not the appropriate authority to investigate the matter. We are and we conducted a thorough investigation that found shortcomings, but no misconduct. The presumption of innocence until proven guilty must prevail, and we agree there must be accountability. There were clear mistakes made during Operation Midland. Henriques identified many of these and we concur, but our investigation found no evidence that the three officers we served notices on for misconduct had deliberately deceived a district court judge when they applied for search warrants to search the homes of Lord Bramall, Leon Brittan and Harvey Proctor. I have met wsome of those affected by Carl Beech\u2019s lies and listened to the significant pain and distress they have experienced \u2013 this should never be repeated. However, we are required to act within the law and our remit. Equally, police officers must work within the law. They must make judgment calls. They have to make decisions many of us would be paralysed by. But they also work within a culture and systems that provide them with guidance, policies and rules. This investigation happened at a time when Britain was rocked by the crimes of Jimmy Savile and other scandals.

The only team that could stop them, Italy, need to beat New Zealand to do so, but a bonus-point victory over pointless Canada, who have lost their two games so far by an aggregate score of 111-7, would end even that slender possibility. The Springboks\u2019 only significant enemy would appear to be complacency, though Rassie Erasmus\u2019s tough talking should deal with that: \u201cIf these players don\u2019t step up then they will fail to stay in the team,\u201d he raged, pre-match. \u201cThey know that and it will be one of the challenges for them.\u201d<br></p> <p>Canada\u2019s assistant coach, Huw Wiltshire, says the Sprinboks and the All Blacks are the best teams in the tournament. \u201cTwo things you can\u2019t defend against in rugby are speed and power, and both those countries have got it across their teams, across the park and across their whole squads,\u201d he added, in what sounded very much like a verbal raising of a metaphorical white flag. </p> <p>Thirteen changes for South Africa, six for Canada, these are today\u2019s teams.

      "bodyText": "Right, I\u2019ll be off. Here\u2019s a match report. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow when there are three fixxtures on what may well become known as Randomly Big Wednesday. Bye! Vital information dept: here are the latest pool tables: Tyler Ardron, the Canada captain, has a chat: Yeah, it was very tough. We could hardly get our hands on the ball in that first 30 minutes. When they had it they did some damage. But I feel we really grew into the game and in the last 50 we put a better performance up. It\u2019s never helpful to get a red card. We\u2019d have rather had 15 out there but we pulled together. Namibia is hugely important. It\u2019s a game we\u2019ve really targeted and we want to put our best performance out and we really hope to get a result out of that. This throw-your-phone-at-a-rugby-player thing seems extremely risky to me. Some rugby-related reading for you while you wait for the match report: South Africa will give their players a couple of days off, with the best part of a fortnight to go until their quarter-final. Unless New Zealand fail to beat Italy they will play the winners of Pool A, currently Japan but potentially Ireland, in Chofu on 20 October. So South Africa qualify from Pool B. They will be joined by Italy, so long as they comfortably beat New Zealand on Saturday, or the All Blacks if they don\u2019t. So New Zealand, basically. 81 mins: No, they can\u2019t. Still, they\u2019re in the quarter-finals. Canada lost this game in the first 15 minutes, but end the game in a certain amount of credit after a much improved second period. 80 mins: The gong sounds. South Africa have the ball. Is there one more try in them? 79 mins: Chance for Canada! But Van der Merwe fumbles! Shane O\u2019Leary\u2019s excellent floated pass left them with three on one on the left flank, but they couldn\u2019t hold onto it! 78 mins: The teams take a couple of minutes over a lineout. \u201cCome on lads,\u201d pleads the referee. 74 mins: The ball is passed to Frans Malherbe, and he\u2019s too powerful, bulldozing between Hearn and Heaton and reaching out to bring the ball down over the line. Jantjies narrowly misses the conversion. 72 mins: Kolisi is brought down a foot from the line. Canada have continued their improvement since half-time, but they are creaking. 68 mins: Three fumbles and knock-ons in about five seconds end with the ball out of play for a Canada line-out. 67 mins: Damian Willemse completes his arrival in the World Cup by touching down on the left, after Canada overcommitted in the centre leaving two green shirts in about 30 yards of empty space. 64 mins: For the first time, South Africa see what they can do in a maul. Thirty seconds later, after a lovely offload from Nkosi, they nearly touch down in the far right only for Hassler to get in the way. 59 mins: Brits is hobbling now, and that\u2019s the end of his game. It looks like he might have pulled a calf muscle, within moments of the restart after his try. If so, that\u2019s the end of the 38-year-old\u2019s World Cup. 55 mins: Excellent stuff from Schalk Brits, who shows nimbleness, acceleration and strength to jink through a tiny gap and then, with several Canadians hanging off him, force himself over the line! 54 mins: Jantjies nearly gets to the line, but after he\u2019s brought down the ball is passed left where Mostert fumbles, and Hassler intercepts and helps Canada escape. 51 mins: South Africa nearly get another! Geland stops the ball going out with his foot, and it pops up nicely into his arms allowing him to head to the line, but he\u2019s taken down a couple of yards short! 50 mins: I don\u2019t know what Kingsley Jones said at half-time, but he should probably have said it before the game started. 49 mins: There\u2019s a heart-in-mouth moment as the referee checks whether Ciaran Hearn was obstructing. He wasn\u2019t. Or rather, he was, but not deliberately. 47 mins: They\u2019ve only gone and scored a try! Hassler comes close but doesn\u2019t quite make it. Matt Heaton picks it up, and does! 46 mins: South Africa steal the ball, give it away, steal it back and give it away. The pressure remains on. 45 mins: For a couple of minutes the ball stays within 10 yards of South Africa\u2019s line. Canada push and probe, but they can\u2019t get within reach of their target. 44 mins: Unexpectedly, the half starts with Canada on the front foot. 41 mins: Peeeeep! They\u2019re off! Again! The player are back out. Can Canada stem the Sprinbok tide? Can South Africa break a few records? Time will tell! South Africa\u2019s possession had dropped to only 78% by half-time. Reinach has scored the fastest hat-trick in World Cup history. And that\u2019s the last action of the first half. It has been extraordinarily one-sided. Here\u2019s the red card incident in full: 41 mins: Horrible! Phil Mack has the ball 10 yards from his own tryline. He assesses his options and then passes straight to Francois Steyn, who has a clear path to the tryline! Jantjies nails another impressive conversion. 39 mins: South Africa threaten again, but with a try looking increasingly inevitable Kwagga Smith fumbles. 36 mins: After lengthy examination of a multitude of replays, the referee decides that Larsen hit Du Toit at neck height, without any obvious justification. He\u2019s off! 37 mins: The referee is looking back at Josh Larsen\u2019s arrival in a ruck, which is high and wild. He looks to be in trouble, precisely how much trouble depending on exactly where he made contact with Thomas du Toit. 36 mins: Play restarts with a five-yard scrum and Canada continue to push, but they can\u2019t quite reach the line! Then Peter Nelson\u2019s kick is charged down. 34 mins: They nearly score an actual try! It\u2019s a long crossfield kick from right to left that finds Van der Merwe, who need only catch it and ground it! He does neither. In fact it looks like Willemse, leaping one-handed, got his fingertips to it, making an easy catch extremely difficult. 33 mins: Canada have the ball for a bit! Phil Mack runs down the right and then passes to Jeff Hassler! The crowd goes wild! 32 mins: The all-time World Cup winning margin is the still distant 142-0, racked up by New Zealand against Namibia in 2003. 30 mins: That\u2019s a fine conversion, and also a relatively quick one. 29 mins: Warrick Gelant touches down on the far right corner. South Africa have had 94% of possession so far. Ninety-four percent! 28 mins: For reference, South Africa\u2019s biggest World Cup win was 87-0, over Namibia in 2011. 25 mins: Whatever Canada\u2019s pre-match plans were, they\u2019ve been ripped up, burned and eaten by a goat. All they have left is wild panic. 22 mins: The scoreboard operators are certainly being kept busy. 20 mins: This all comes from a brilliant crossfield kick from Jantjies which releases Gelant on the right. He sprints 50 yards before passing inside to De Allende, who moves it on to Reinach, who can\u2019t be caught! 20 mins: Another two points on the board. For so long as it takes four Canadians to bring down Snyman, they\u2019re going to be in trouble. 18 mins: Less than halfway through the 18th minute of the game, South Africa secure the bonus point! It\u2019s like a medley of two of the Sprinboks\u2019 previous tries, as another Snyman burst rips through Canada, and Reinach dives over. 17 mins: Obviously there\u2019s no coming back from this, but Canada have at least had a few minutes of relative sanity. Still, Canada have the ball and have a penalty advantage. 12 mins: Jantjies is warned by the referee about how long he\u2019s taking over the conversion, which he then sends betwixt the posts. 10 mins: This could get pretty ugly. From a ruck inside his own half Cobus Reinach plucks the ball off the ground, feints left and then sprints straight ahead. He zips into space, dinks a kick over the final red shirt, runs onto it, collects and screams to the line! That\u2019s a fantastic try! 8 mins: Elton Jantjies shanks his conversion attempt, which was as hard as a conversion attempt will ever be for a left-footer, wide. 6 mins: Sibusiso Nkosi sprints down the left-hand touchline, so wide he\u2019s got chalk on his boots, and there\u2019s no stopping him! 3 mins: A horrible start for Canada! Their defence is riddled with holes already, and Damian de Allende dances through one of them! 2 mins: RG Snyman bursts through the Canadian defence, and bulldozes to within a yard of the line! 1 min: They\u2019re off! The anthems have been sung, and all preliminaries completed. Hold on to your hats! And they\u2019re out! Canada\u2019s captain, Tyler Ardron, is clutching a cuddly toy, like a nervous schoolboy on his way into the exam hall. Action in Kobe! The players are gathering near the dressing-room doors, preparing for exit. I find this man\u2019s hat really quite scary: According to various news outlets this morning, England\u2019s game against France is under threat because of Typhoon Hagibis. If of all pool stage games the weather chooses to nix one between two teams that have already qualified for the quarter-finals, it has done rather well. Looks like Canada have won the toss, and will kick off. South Africa aren\u2019t officially through to the quarter-finals, but they\u2019re very close. The only team that could stop them, Italy, need to beat New Zealand to do so, but a bonus-point victory over pointless Canada, who have lost their two games so far by an aggregate score of 111-7, would end even that slender possibility. The Springboks\u2019 only significant enemy would appear to be complacency, though Rassie Erasmus\u2019s tough talking should deal with that: \u201cIf these players don\u2019t step up then they will fail to stay in the team,\u201d he raged, pre-match. \u201cThey know that and it will be one of the challenges for them.\u201d Canada\u2019s assistant coach, Huw Wiltshire, says the Sprinboks and the All Blacks are the best teams in the tournament. \u201cTwo things you can\u2019t defend against in rugby are speed and power, and both those countries have got it across their teams, across the park and across their whole squads,\u201d he added, in what sounded very much like a verbal raising of a metaphorical white flag. Thirteen changes for South Africa, six for Canada, these are today\u2019s teams. And welcome!

Are you going to be able to get a vet with your paperwork in time to do this?\u201d asked Andrew Kuyk, the director general of the Provision Trade Federation, which represents the seafood sector.</p> <p>The EU is also unlikely to allow fish through without the correct paperwork, MPs were told.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a real risk that in a no-deal Brexit where our neighbours want to be less than helpful and merely enforce their regulations in a competent way, our exports could be stopped overnight because the catch certificates do not comply,\u201d said Portmann.</p> <p>\u201cAll fresh produce is time-sensitive. Live shellfish is very time-sensitive. Lorryloads of lobsters when they are dead and dying is not good news,\u201d said David Jarrad, the chief executive of the Shellfish Association of Great Britain.</p> <p>The committee heard that, while the government has indicated it has trained or is in the process of training 1,000 vets to be ready for no deal, there is little evidence of their existence or availability in the middle of the night.</p> <p>In a scathing commentary on the government\u2019s planning, Portmann said: \u201cIf the ambition of this government, through this process, has been to create a catch certificate system that we hope that nobody really checks or gives too much scrutiny to, to train 1,000 vets that aren\u2019t really accessible or in contact with the industry, then the government has been successful in its planning.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s fishing fleets could face a de facto blockade within 48 hours of a no-deal Brexit, MPs have been told. Representatives of the fishing industry said it was \u201ca bit of an understatement\u201d to describe the UK\u2019s preparations for no deal as \u201ca shambles\u201d. Not only is the country not ready, but there are not enough vets to stamp paperwork for every boatload of fish, which would be mandatory in a no-deal scenario, MPs heard. \u201cYou could realistically be looking at the UK fishing fleet, certainly the fleet that\u2019s catching exportable products, tied up within 48 hours of a no-deal Brexit,\u201d said Terri Portmann, a marine consultant. If trucks carrying perishable goods were caught in queues at Dover, this would have a knock-on effect at the daily fish auctions, with hauliers unable to pick up loads, she said. \u201cWould it not be an irony that the UK fishing fleet, who loyally, almost unanimously, voted for Brexit, got tied up because the government didn\u2019t help and intervene to make sure the exports they so heavily rely on could continue,\u201d she said. The committee heard that about 50 lorries a day carry shellfish to the continent and that in a no-deal scenario, they would have to be accompanied by between two and four pieces of paperwork, including catch certificates, export health certificates, a process statement and a storage document. The hauliers would also have to carry their own Brexit paperwork, including driver permits. This would be likely to cause delays, as the staff at ports would have no way of prioritising fresh food in a queue of up to 10,000 lorries a day travelling between Dover and Calais. MPs also heard that the UK lacks the army of vets and health authority officials who would need to be at the ready to certify the huge volumes of shellfish landed in Scotland or Northern Ireland for export to the continent. \u201cIf you are sending fish from Northern Ireland on a land route across the short strait [Dover to Calais] you have to have that signed off by the vet before you load the lorry and then you\u2019ve got anything from 24 hours plus transit time and you might normally be loading the lorry and sealing it at two or three in the morning. Are you going to be able to get a vet with your paperwork in time to do this?\u201d asked Andrew Kuyk, the director general of the Provision Trade Federation, which represents the seafood sector. The EU is also unlikely to allow fish through without the correct paperwork, MPs were told. \u201cThere is a real risk that in a no-deal Brexit where our neighbours want to be less than helpful and merely enforce their regulations in a competent way, our exports could be stopped overnight because the catch certificates do not comply,\u201d said Portmann. \u201cAll fresh produce is time-sensitive. Live shellfish is very time-sensitive. Lorryloads of lobsters when they are dead and dying is not good news,\u201d said David Jarrad, the chief executive of the Shellfish Association of Great Britain. The committee heard that, while the government has indicated it has trained or is in the process of training 1,000 vets to be ready for no deal, there is little evidence of their existence or availability in the middle of the night. In a scathing commentary on the government\u2019s planning, Portmann said: \u201cIf the ambition of this government, through this process, has been to create a catch certificate system that we hope that nobody really checks or gives too much scrutiny to, to train 1,000 vets that aren\u2019t really accessible or in contact with the industry, then the government has been successful in its planning.\u201d",

Stony-faced business types, rucksack-touting tourists and yawning schoolchildren jostle for space in the rush-hour crush. But among the crowds of commuters is another group waiting to board the train \u2013 a covert patrol of plainclothed officers looking to catch sexual predators in the act. New research has found that reports of sexual harassment on the London underground have soared by 42% in the last four years. Sadly, it\u2019s a problem on public transport the world over \u2013 from the buses of Hanoi to the New York subway. \u201cWe know that offenders in every city will target public transport systems as a place to commit offences because of the opportunity it provides,\u201d says Mandy McGregor, head of policing and community safety for Transport for London, which is deploying the undercover officers as part of its Project Guardian scheme. \u201cCrowded trains allow offenders to evade detection as they can claim it was accidental or a result of the movement of a vehicle. Women may not know who has assaulted them, particularly during rush hour, and may not react because they are trapped or feel embarrassed to say anything. Groping or touching is the most prevalent offence reported, but we\u2019re also seeing relatively new offences such as upskirting and viewing pornography while on public transport.\u201d TfL has also rolled out the Report It to Stop It initiative, which encourages people to report offences by text message. Similarly, in 2017 the Los Angeles Metro launched Off-Limits, a 24-hour hotline for reporting sexual harassment staffed by trained counsellors. And the OnDuty app by Metro Vancouver allows passengers to text police and transport officers directly, as well as giving them access to reports on crime hotspots and summaries of crimes around particular stations. \u201cInternational evidence suggests that the most effective interventions on public transport adopt a combination of different approaches,\u201d says McGregor. \u201cWe need to make it harder for potential offenders to offend, give victims the means and confidence to report, and create a culture where sexual harassment is not tolerated.\u201d But clearly in most cities there\u2019s still a long way to go. A 2018 report by the humanitarian NGO Plan International found that sexual harassment is the number-one safety risk facing girls and young women across the world, with Lima considered the most dangerous city of those surveyed for women to use public transport and Stockholm the safest. In separate research, Plan also asked women and girls in five cities (Delhi, Kampala, Lima, Madrid and Sydney) to use geolocating to drop a \u201cgood\u201d pin on locations they enjoy, and a \u201cbad\u201d pin on the places they feel unsafe or uncomfortable. Transport hubs, train and bus stations and bus stops were found to be prime locations for groping and harassment. Similar crowd-mapping techniques have also been used by south Asia\u2019s SafetiPin, India\u2019s HarassMap, and the international Everyday Sexism project to suggest ideas for changes to key decision-makers in architecture, urban planning and public transport. \u201cRelentless sexual harassment and abuse is the daily norm for so many young women and girls on our city streets,\u201d says Anne-Birgitte Albrectsen, CEO of Plan International. \u201cWe heard the same story in each of the five cities we surveyed: young women are frightened for their physical safety, and angry that this harassment and bullying is not taken seriously. \u201cHarassment should not be seen as part of a \u2018normal\u2019 life for girls and young women.

Lawyers acting for three anti-Brexit campaigners told the court of session on Tuesday the prime minister and his closest advisers had repeatedly said they planned to sidestep or frustrate the so-called Benn act. That legislation, the European Union (Withdrawal) (No 2) Act, requires Johnson to write to the EU asking for an extension until 31 January if he fails to get a Brexit deal agreed at Westminster by 19 October. In a surprise move last Friday, lawyers for the UK government said for the first time that Johnson accepted he had to send the letter and could not frustrate that request for an extension to the Brexit talks by secretly asking EU member states to refuse it. Aidan O\u2019Neill QC, the lawyer for the green energy millionaire Dale Vince; the SNP MP Joanna Cherry QC, and the anti-Brexit campaigner Jolyon Maugham QC, told the court that since then Downing Street sources and the prime minister had repeated their threats to ignore or sidestep the act. Therefore the court should use its unique nobile officium powers to send that letter on Johnson\u2019s behalf if he failed to do so. Those powers allow Scottish judges to take action to ensure a legal requirement is upheld if the person responsible fails to do so.

His production has an all-female cast playing survivors of domestic abuse who are enacting Hamilton\u2019s play as an exercise in drama therapy. To prepare, Beecham worked closely with a women\u2019s refuge. The cast created individual backstories for the modern women they are playing and they remained in character when a care worker took them through a workshop designed for survivors of abuse. The cast are simultaneously playing the women in the refuge as well as Hamilton\u2019s characters, so when Bella delivers an impassioned speech towards the end, it becomes \u201ca sort of exorcism\u201d. This approach also means that, in the context of Beecham\u2019s production, a survivor of abuse is also taking on the role of the abuser, which makes the scene in which Jack attacks Bella more emotionally complex.</p> <p>The character of the police inspector Rough, who is Bella\u2019s rescuer, can be problematic for a director today: he is another dominating male presence.

Beecham has merged the character with the figure of the drama therapist and has \u201cpruned the text to remove some of the lazy sexism and the patronising attitudes\u201d. Is there not, I ask, also an issue with a man directing a cast of women in a play about emotional control and power imbalance? It\u2019s something they\u2019ve discussed.

      "bodyText": "The term \u201cgaslighting\u201d \u2013 psychological manipulation intended to make the victim question their sanity \u2013 has become embedded in our language. This year, accusations of gaslighting were aimed at Love Island housemates Michael and Curtis. In the Netflix series Jessica Jones, David Tennant\u2019s character played mind-control games with his victims (intensified by the fact that he could actually control minds). Taylor Swift even declared that the US public had been gaslighted by Donald Trump\u2019s politics. The term derives from Patrick Hamilton\u2019s 1938 play Gaslight, which is itself fittingly deceptive. On the surface it\u2019s a Victorian melodrama, a real potboiler, but it is uncannily insightful and accurate in its depiction of an abusive relationship. The play was the basis for a 1940 film directed by Thorold Dickinson and for George Cukor\u2019s 1944 film starring Ingrid Bergman. Along with his drama Rope, Gaslight made Hamilton wealthy. In the play, Jack Manningham manipulates and undermines his wife, Bella. His temper is constantly fluctuating; he dismisses and belittles her and, by turning the lights on and off, starts to make her think she is going mad. \u201cIt\u2019s so acute in its portrayal of psychological domestic abuse and toxic masculinity, but people can lose sight of that,\u201d says Richard Beecham, whose production of Gaslight is at Watford Palace theatre this month. \u201cPatrick Hamilton the commercial playwright could never quite leave behind Hamilton the literary novelist,\u201d says Beecham. \u201cHe was a complicated man and, reading his biography, it seems he had some understanding of some of the behaviours he\u2019s writing about.\u201d Hamilton\u2019s tendency to become infatuated with unsuitable women seeped into his fiction.

There have already been revivals at Perth theatre and the Mill at Sonning; a version starring Martin Shaw is touring the UK and another Gaslight is coming to the Playground theatre in London.

      "bodyText": "The productivity of British workers fell at the fastest pace for five years in the second quarter of 2019, amid mounting concerns over the impact of Brexit uncertainty on the economy. The Office for National Statistics said labour productivity \u2013 a measure of economic output per hour of work \u2013 slumped by 0.5% in the three months to June compared with the same period a year ago, the worst performance since mid-2014. In a sign that the UK is continuing its dismal track record since the financial crisis, which economists believe has been exacerbated by the Brexit vote, the latest fall follows two consecutive quarters of zero growth. The ONS said there was no growth in output per job in the second quarter, a period when job creation continued to deliver the highest employment levels on record but when the economy also contracted for the first time since 2012. Economists believe improvement in productivity is vital for lifting economic growth and raising living standards. Boris Johnson made productivity a central plank of his speech to the Conservative party conference in Manchester last week, saying: \u201cWith infrastructure, education and technology we will drive up the productivity of this country and bring it together.\u201d Theresa May had also placed productivity at the heart of her agenda, with it forming the backbone of her government\u2019s industrial strategy, although lobby groups and Labour have repeatedly warned that too little is being achieved. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said the latest snapshot showed the Conservatives were \u201crunning the economy into the ground\u201d. \u201cThis damning indictment of the government\u2019s record reflects not just its Brexit bungling but a failure to tackle long-term challenges in the economy,\u201d he said. The findings from the ONS show how the UK has been held back by low productivity and investment since the financial crisis, and suggest the trend has been exacerbated since the EU referendum. Economists believe the vote to leave the EU and continuing uncertainty over the UK\u2019s future trade relationships discouraged companies from investing in productivity-boosting technology.

The movement has since expanded to include the question of Hong Kong\u2019s legal independence from China. Police and pro-democracy protestors have clashed, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/02/hong-kong-protests-police-teenager-shooting-students-violence-\">live ammunition even being used on the crowds</a>.</p> <p>On Friday, Daryl Morey, general manager of the Houston Rockets, tweeted, then deleted, an image in support of the protests that stated: \u201cFight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.\u201d He tweeted in support of freedom, which even in splintered times, seems like the tamest of positions any US citizen could take.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/07/nba-hong-kong-protests-china-houston-rockets-daryl-morey\">Ted Cruz says NBA is 'assisting Chinese censorship' over Hong Kong tweet</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The tweet set off a geopolitical firestorm. The Chinese government, the Chinese Basketball Association, and two sponsors \u2013 Li-Ning and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank \u2013 announced they were halting their relationships with the NBA and the Rockets specifically. The NBA released statements in English and Mandarin distancing themselves from Morey\u2019s tweet. Perhaps most detrimentally, Tencent, the NBA digital rights holder in China, which recently announced a five-year expansion of the pair\u2019s existing deal, announced Morey was blacklisted. Tencent suspended all coverage of the Rockets.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/nba/2019/10/6/20901828/daryl-morey-hong-kong-china-houston-rockets-tweet-controversy\">Reports suggested</a> the Rockets discussed removing Morey in order to halt the financial bleeding. Part of owner Tilman Fertitta\u2019s calculations when spending an NBA record $2.2bn to but the Rockets in 2017 was that he was buying into China, <em>the </em>biggest \u2013 in terms of population \u2013 market on Earth, whether that market was run by an autocratic government or not. The Rockets had been one of the most popular NBA teams in China, thanks to Yao Ming\u2019s stint with the team \u2013 now president of the CBA and a Hall of Fame player.</p> <p>Both the response of the NBA and the Rockets stank. The NBA commissioner, Adam Silver, perhaps aware that the league has won plaudits for supporting players speaking out on social issues in the US, tried to rollback the league\u2019s initial statement in an interview given to Kyodo News in Tokyo. \u201cThese are complex issues they don\u2019t lend themselves easily to social media,\u201d Silver said. \u201cI can\u2019t ultimately run the NBA based on trying to satisfy everyone on Twitter.\u201d He later added that: \u201cwe are not apologizing for Daryl exercising his freedom of expression.\u201d</p> <p>The NBA\u2019s response spoke volumes. By trying to play both sides the commissioner\u2019s office was straddling the middle line. You cannot fence sit accusations of human rights abuses. Silver and the league\u2019s head office were happy to lap up the praise for their supposed \u201cwokeness\u201d when it came to issues in the US such as <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-commissioner-adam-silver-on-mental-health-of-league-a-lot-of-players-are-unhappy/\">supporting players\u2019 mental health</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/sep/22/nba-black-players-protests-adam-silver-lebron-james\">Black Lives Matter movement</a> and other issues that ultimately fit with their overall target: selling League Pass subscriptions to young people with disposable income.</p> <p>The NBA is by far America\u2019s blackest league. Not just in <a href=\"https://globalsportmatters.com/culture/2018/12/12/in-an-ethnic-breakdown-of-sports-nba-takes-lead-for-most-diverse/\">its demographics</a>, but in its style and packaging and sensibilities.

      "bodyText": "The NBA\u2019s handling of the Daryl Morey controversy over the weekend showed the league is happy to toe the \u201cwoke\u201d line at home while selling out abroad, all in the endless pursuit of cash. Since June, anti-government protests have swept Hong Kong. The movement has since expanded to include the question of Hong Kong\u2019s legal independence from China. Police and pro-democracy protestors have clashed, with live ammunition even being used on the crowds. On Friday, Daryl Morey, general manager of the Houston Rockets, tweeted, then deleted, an image in support of the protests that stated: \u201cFight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.\u201d He tweeted in support of freedom, which even in splintered times, seems like the tamest of positions any US citizen could take. The tweet set off a geopolitical firestorm. The Chinese government, the Chinese Basketball Association, and two sponsors \u2013 Li-Ning and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank \u2013 announced they were halting their relationships with the NBA and the Rockets specifically. The NBA released statements in English and Mandarin distancing themselves from Morey\u2019s tweet. Perhaps most detrimentally, Tencent, the NBA digital rights holder in China, which recently announced a five-year expansion of the pair\u2019s existing deal, announced Morey was blacklisted. Tencent suspended all coverage of the Rockets. Reports suggested the Rockets discussed removing Morey in order to halt the financial bleeding. Part of owner Tilman Fertitta\u2019s calculations when spending an NBA record $2.2bn to but the Rockets in 2017 was that he was buying into China, the biggest \u2013 in terms of population \u2013 market on Earth, whether that market was run by an autocratic government or not. The Rockets had been one of the most popular NBA teams in China, thanks to Yao Ming\u2019s stint with the team \u2013 now president of the CBA and a Hall of Fame player. Both the response of the NBA and the Rockets stank. The NBA commissioner, Adam Silver, perhaps aware that the league has won plaudits for supporting players speaking out on social issues in the US, tried to rollback the league\u2019s initial statement in an interview given to Kyodo News in Tokyo. \u201cThese are complex issues they don\u2019t lend themselves easily to social media,\u201d Silver said. \u201cI can\u2019t ultimately run the NBA based on trying to satisfy everyone on Twitter.\u201d He later added that: \u201cwe are not apologizing for Daryl exercising his freedom of expression.\u201d The NBA\u2019s response spoke volumes. By trying to play both sides the commissioner\u2019s office was straddling the middle line. You cannot fence sit accusations of human rights abuses. Silver and the league\u2019s head office were happy to lap up the praise for their supposed \u201cwokeness\u201d when it came to issues in the US such as supporting players\u2019 mental health, the Black Lives Matter movement and other issues that ultimately fit with their overall target: selling League Pass subscriptions to young people with disposable income. The NBA is by far America\u2019s blackest league. Not just in its demographics, but in its style and packaging and sensibilities. Its fanbase is the most diverse and global of any American sports league, by some distance. Its global expansion has come at a time of fraught political tension across the world. Under Silver\u2019s leadership, the NBA pulled the 2017 All-Star Game out of Charlotte, North Carolina, over a law restricting bathroom use for transgender people. \u201cAll CEOs, all big corporations these days really have no choice,\u201d Silver said in 2018. \u201cIt\u2019s an expectation from their customers that they\u2019re going to take a position.\u201d LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Carmelo Anthony and Chris Paul, four of the sport\u2019s biggest stars, while onstage at the ESPYs in July of 2016, decried police shootings of people of color. James called President Donald Trump a \u201cbum\u201d. Silver\u2019s steering of the league has earned him almost universal praise from players, fans and media alike. Taking liberal stands has played to his base and been good for business. In contrast Roger Goodell, the head of the NFL, America\u2019s most popular league, is seen as an offish buffoon who caved to the President and blackballed Colin Kaepernick, a player exercising his rights, in order to boost profits among the sport\u2019s conservative fanbase.

One is the so-called transit method where scientists watch for planets as they wander across the face of their parent star. Even though the star is but a pinprick in the heavens, sensitive telescopes can often detect the minuscule dimming of the starlight as the planet goes by and casts its shadow on the detector. It\u2019s been extremely successful - Nasa\u2019s Kepler\u2019s mission is one space telescope that has exploited transits to find hoards of new planets.</p> <p>Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz used a different technique. They looked at how stars are pulled around by planets that swing around them. This radial velocity method exploits the Doppler effect. In this case, as a planet\u2019s gravity pulls its star towards Earth - with its telescope-wielding astronomers - light from the star is shifted towards the blue wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. The rays are basically squeezed up, making them bluer. As the planet goes around the star and pulls it backwards, the starlight is stretched out and so turns more towards the red end of the electromagnetic spectrum. Measure these wavelength variations and you can work out first if there\u2019s an unseen planet in orbit around a star, and secondly how long a year lasts on the world.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-08T11:24:20.495Z\">at 12.24pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d9c6cbc8f084ab841734b64\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-08T11:03:33.118Z\">12.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>How much of the galaxy have we searched for planets beyond the solar system?

The big bang model describes how the universe evolved over nearly 14bn years from a hot, dense ball to the vast, cold and expanding universe of today. </p> <p>Barely 400,000 years after the big bang, the murky universe cleared and became transparent allowing light rays to travel through space. Today that relic radiation remains as the cosmic microwave back ground. In it are written many of the early universe\u2019s secrets.</p> <p>With theoretical tools and calculations, James Peebles interpreted these traces from the infancy of the universe and discovered new physical processes. He found that only 5% of the observable universe is known to us in the form of stars, planets and people. The remaining 95% is mysterious and made up of what physicists call dark energy and dark matter. So-called dark energy is said to drive the expansion of the universe, while dark matter is the invisible substance that appears to hang around galaxies, revealing itself only by its gravitational draw. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d9c61228f08fbb0c1722f2b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-08T10:14:12.528Z\">11.14am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Peebles has been asked if he has advice for young people considering a career in science.

They have gone to 209 individuals with John Bardeen being the only person to land two, in 1956 and 1972, for work on semiconductors and superconductors respectively. </p> <p>Sir Andre Geim at Manchester University can boast of winning both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/oct/05/nobel-prize-physics\">the Nobel prize</a> and the rather more irreverent <a href=\"https://www.improbable.com/2010/10/05/geim-becomes-first-nobel-ig-nobel-winner/\">Ig Nobel prize</a>. He shared the 2010 Nobel prize in physics with Sir Konstantin Novoselov for discovering the hoped-to-be wonder material, graphene. The prize came ten years after Geim shared the Ig Nobel prize for levitating a frog with a fellow amphibian-bothering knight, Sir Michael Berry.

The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/jul/04/higgs-boson-cern-scientists-discover\">discovery of the Higgs boson</a> in 2012 teed up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/oct/08/nobel-laureate-peter-higgs-boson-elusive\">Peter Higgs</a> and Francois Englert for the prize the following year. And then, in 2017, scientists on the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (Ligo) won for announcing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/feb/11/gravitational-waves-discovery-hailed-as-breakthrough-of-the-century\">the first detection of gravitational waves</a> the year before. </p> <p>This year\u2019s winner is harder to call, but there\u2019s no shortage of physicists who may have turned in last night in the quiet hope of having their day, or most probably their sleep, interrupted by an enthusiastic Swede. </p> <p>There\u2019s the trio of Alain Aspect, Anton Zeilinger and John Clauser for their work on quantum entanglement. There\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/sep/17/invisibility-cloak-could-turn-beer-bellies-into-six-packs\">John Pendry</a> for his cool invisibility cloaks, which are neither invisible nor cloaks, but why spoil the fun? Another contender is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/oct/07/five-women-the-nobel-prize-missed\">Lene Hau</a> who worked out how to slow down and even stop light. And what about all those exoplanets astronomers keep finding? One day there will surely be a prize for worlds that are out-of-this-world and I can see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/1999/dec/16/starsgalaxiesandplanets\">Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz</a> sharing that. Who else? If the Wolf prize is any guide, and history suggests it is, Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard who work on quantum information science are in with a chance. And if the committee is feeling practical, perhaps John Goodenough will win, at last, for lithium-ion batteries.

      "bodyText": "And there we leave the physics prize for another year. Huge congratulations go to James Peebles, who set the foundations for modern cosmology with his work on the big bang, dark matter and dark energy, and to Didier Queloz and Michel Mayor who spotted the first world beyond the solar system. Here is my colleague Hannah Devlin\u2019s news story on the prize: We\u2019ll be back again tomorrow for the Nobel prize in chemistry. Is it time for gene editing to win the gong? Join us from 10.15am! There are two methods that astronomers use to spot planets around other stars. One is the so-called transit method where scientists watch for planets as they wander across the face of their parent star. Even though the star is but a pinprick in the heavens, sensitive telescopes can often detect the minuscule dimming of the starlight as the planet goes by and casts its shadow on the detector. It\u2019s been extremely successful - Nasa\u2019s Kepler\u2019s mission is one space telescope that has exploited transits to find hoards of new planets. Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz used a different technique. They looked at how stars are pulled around by planets that swing around them. This radial velocity method exploits the Doppler effect. In this case, as a planet\u2019s gravity pulls its star towards Earth - with its telescope-wielding astronomers - light from the star is shifted towards the blue wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. The rays are basically squeezed up, making them bluer. As the planet goes around the star and pulls it backwards, the starlight is stretched out and so turns more towards the red end of the electromagnetic spectrum. Measure these wavelength variations and you can work out first if there\u2019s an unseen planet in orbit around a star, and secondly how long a year lasts on the world. How much of the galaxy have we searched for planets beyond the solar system? Not an awful lot...so we can only imagine what lies out there. Here\u2019s Didier Queloz talking about the discovery of that first known exoplanet. \u201cAt that time I didn\u2019t think at all it was a planet. I just thought something was wrong.\u201d Here are the official citations for this year\u2019s winners: The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences has decided to award the Nobel Prize in Physics 2019 \u201cfor contributions to our understanding of the evolution of the universe and Earth\u2019s place in the cosmos\u201d With one half to James Peebles at Princeton University \u201cfor theoretical discoveries in physical cosmology\u201d and the other half jointly to Michel Mayor at the University of Geneva and Didier Queloz at the University of Geneva, Switzerland and the University of Cambridge, UK. But what about Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz? In October 1995 the duo announced the first discovery of a planet outside our solar system. Using custom-made instruments, they spotted the Jupiter-like planet 51 Pegasi b from the Haute-Provence Observatory in southern France. The work led to a surge of similar such discoveries. Today, more than 4,000 exoplanets have been spotted in the Milky Way, and the discoveries keep on coming. These are wild and wonderful worlds. The easiest to spot are vast, blisteringly-hot gas giants that swing around their parent stars on extremely close-in orbits. Others appear to be rocky and lurk in the habitable zone, where liquid water would run freely. Still others are thought to be exotic water worlds: their entire surface an ocean. As more planets are found, and more observatories are launched in to orbit, or switched on here on Earth, astronomers are getting closer to answering what is perhaps one of the most profound questions humans ask: are we alone? Here\u2019s James Peebles in 2017 talking about the history of modern cosmology at the Perimeter Institute in Canada. James Peebles\u2019 work shone a light on the universe\u2019s structure and history and laid the foundations for cosmology for the past 50 years. The big bang model describes how the universe evolved over nearly 14bn years from a hot, dense ball to the vast, cold and expanding universe of today. Barely 400,000 years after the big bang, the murky universe cleared and became transparent allowing light rays to travel through space. Today that relic radiation remains as the cosmic microwave back ground. In it are written many of the early universe\u2019s secrets. With theoretical tools and calculations, James Peebles interpreted these traces from the infancy of the universe and discovered new physical processes. He found that only 5% of the observable universe is known to us in the form of stars, planets and people. The remaining 95% is mysterious and made up of what physicists call dark energy and dark matter. So-called dark energy is said to drive the expansion of the universe, while dark matter is the invisible substance that appears to hang around galaxies, revealing itself only by its gravitational draw. Peebles has been asked if he has advice for young people considering a career in science. He does indeed: You should enter it for the love of the science. The awards and prizes, they are charming and very much appreciated, but that\u2019s not part of your plans. You should enter science because you\u2019re fascinated by it. \u201cWe still must admit that the dark matter and dark energy are mysterious,\u201d says John Peebles in an interview with the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. \u201cThere are still many open questions \u2026 what in the world is this dark matter?\u201d Is there life on other planets, he\u2019s asked? He\u2019s pretty sure there will be something we\u2019ll call life on other planets. But adds: \u201cWhether it will be like life on Earth is very difficult for me to know, maybe chemists will sort that out \u2026 we can be very sure we will never ever see these other lives, these other planets.\u201d A theoretical framework, developed by James Peebles over two decades, has become the foundation of our modern understanding of the universe\u2019s history, from the big bang to the present day. Meanwhile, in 1995, Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz discovered the first planet outside our solar system, an exoplanet, orbiting a sun-type star, 51 Pegasi. Well the prize was certainly coming and it\u2019s well deserved. Astronomers have found thousands of exoplanets since this trio effectively launched the field. The discover of worlds beyond our solar system has truly transformed our understanding not only of the Milky Way, but of our place within it. OK, here we go. I wonder if the bookies take many bets on the Nobel science prizes? I\u2019ve never bothered, with a wisdom that the coming announcement will confirm. And now we do have confirmation: the announcement will be at 10.50am UK. Oh they do love to keep us waiting. We\u2019ve had no official word of delay, but it\u2019s not unusual for them to run over the stated start time. The tension, the tension.... Here\u2019s G\u00f6ran K Hansson, secretary-general of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and the chap who gets to make the calls. You have to admit he\u2019s well turned out for the occasion. What\u2019s the point of the Nobel prizes you might ask. It raises a whole bunch of issues that scientists and others have picked over for decades. The short answer, perhaps, is that it does wonders for Alfred Nobel\u2019s name. But does it promote the myth of the lone genius, and ignore the reality of the collaborations that drive modern science? Certainly. Here\u2019s a piece that Hannah Devlin and I wrote on the whole malarkey. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences has handed out 112 Nobel prizes in physics since 1901. They have gone to 209 individuals with John Bardeen being the only person to land two, in 1956 and 1972, for work on semiconductors and superconductors respectively. Sir Andre Geim at Manchester University can boast of winning both the Nobel prize and the rather more irreverent Ig Nobel prize. He shared the 2010 Nobel prize in physics with Sir Konstantin Novoselov for discovering the hoped-to-be wonder material, graphene. The prize came ten years after Geim shared the Ig Nobel prize for levitating a frog with a fellow amphibian-bothering knight, Sir Michael Berry. A year later, Geim published a paper on Earth\u2019s rotation with his hamster, Tisha. So far only three women have won the physics prize, roughly once every 60 years. The clause bears repeating: that\u2019s once every 60 years. They are Marie Curie (radiation) in 1903, Maria Goeppert-Mayer (nuclear shell structure) in 1963 and Donna Strickland (chirped pulse amplification) last year. No woman has yet been named the sole winner of the prize. All have shared it with two men. The physics prize has been easy to predict a couple of times in recent years. The discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 teed up Peter Higgs and Francois Englert for the prize the following year. And then, in 2017, scientists on the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (Ligo) won for announcing the first detection of gravitational waves the year before. This year\u2019s winner is harder to call, but there\u2019s no shortage of physicists who may have turned in last night in the quiet hope of having their day, or most probably their sleep, interrupted by an enthusiastic Swede. There\u2019s the trio of Alain Aspect, Anton Zeilinger and John Clauser for their work on quantum entanglement. There\u2019s John Pendry for his cool invisibility cloaks, which are neither invisible nor cloaks, but why spoil the fun? Another contender is Lene Hau who worked out how to slow down and even stop light. And what about all those exoplanets astronomers keep finding? One day there will surely be a prize for worlds that are out-of-this-world and I can see Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz sharing that. Who else? If the Wolf prize is any guide, and history suggests it is, Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard who work on quantum information science are in with a chance. And if the committee is feeling practical, perhaps John Goodenough will win, at last, for lithium-ion batteries. Having said all that I can hear the complaints already: \u201cWhat about Perovskite solar cells?\u201d And it\u2019s a fair point. The bottom line? We have no idea. Last year\u2019s physics prize was shared among three scientists who turned light into tools. The US researcher Arthur Ashkin, who at 96 became the oldest recipient ever, was awarded half of the prize for inventing \u201coptical tweezers\u201d, which harness the pressure of laser light to manipulate tiny objects, such as bacteria and viruses. G\u00e9rard Mourou of France and Donna Strickland of Canada split the remaining half of the prize money for what is called chirped pulse amplification which generates bright, ultrashort laser pulses. The method paved the way for millions of people to receive laser eye surgery. Strickland became only the third woman to win the physics Nobel. And so to day two of the 2019 Nobel prizes! The season kicked off yesterday when Sir Peter Ratcliffe at Oxford University, Gregg Semenza at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, and William Kaelin at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston shared the Nobel prize in physiology or medicine for discovering how cells sense and respond to an oxygen shortage. The trio, who will split the 9m Swedish kronor (\u00a3740,000) winnings, spent more than two decades piecing together the complex genetic machinery that allows animals to thrive at some of the highest altitudes on Earth. The work has paved the way for new anaemia drugs, while other medicines are in the pipeline for treating cancers, heart disease and stroke. But today is all about the physics prize.

      "bodyText": "An investigation is taking place after a raft on a Center Parcs ride flipped over, injuring a man and two children. The holiday company apologised after the man and his nephew, 12, and niece, 13, were hurt on the Tropical Cyclone ride at a site in Longleat, Wiltshire, on 19 August. The man was taken to hospital with suspected broken ribs, while the children sustained minor head injuries. The BBC said there had been 23 reports of rafts overturning on the Tropical Cyclone in the past six months, across the four Center Parcs villages that have the ride. A Center Parcs spokesperson said they were sorry for the \u201cobvious upset this incident will have caused to both the guest and their family\u201d. They said they had immediately closed the ride following the incident and conducted safety checks, which found no issues. Wiltshire council said its public protection team was investigating the incident. \u201cWe are working closely with Center Parcs, and other partners, to determine the best practice moving forward,\u201d said a spokesperson. Speaking to the BBC, the man involved in the incident said: \u201cWe went into thin air and that\u2019s why we flipped. The thing that I really remember was the cracking sound of my ribs hitting the side of the flume.\u201d He said his niece had an \u201cimpressive bump just above her right eye, bruising along the right side of her chin\u201d. She had a headache for about a week, said the man, while his nephew had a headache for the rest of the day. Center Parcs\u2019 website describes the ride as \u201ca two- or three-person raft ride with 142 metres of twists, turns and gravity-defying drops and added audio-visual themes to choose from\u201d. A spokesperson for the company said they were confident staff correctly loaded the raft. \u201cWe would like to offer reassurance that we take the safety of our guests and employees extremely seriously,\u201d they said. \u201cHundreds of thousands of guests use our Tropical Cyclone ride every year and incidents of this nature are extremely rare. We conduct rigorous health and safety checks on a daily basis to ensure our facilities are as safe as possible.\u201d In March last year, the company was fined \u00a3250,000 for health and safety breaches after a child broke her wrist falling from a tree during a climbing activity.",

She was first taken into care at the age of three and she says she can easily imagine her unhappy younger self \u201cclimbing the walls with excitement\u201d about the dedication. \u201cI binge-read Jacqueline Wilson\u2019s books growing up. I was in a pretty tough foster home at the time, and I saw a lot of myself in Tracy because I had a lot of behavioural issues.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad \u2013 and thankful \u2013 that Jacqueline\u2019s had another look at Tracy and has come up with the book that she has,\u201d she explains. \u201cI know \u2018happy ever after\u2019 doesn\u2019t always happen.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump was dangerously isolated on Monday as, in a rare rebuke, some of his most loyal allies revolted against his decision to withdraw US troops from north-eastern Syria. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell led a chorus of Republicans who, having defended the president on almost every other issue \u2013 including over impeachment \u2013 decided to draw a line in the sand. \u201cA precipitous withdrawal of US forces from Syria would only benefit Russia, Iran, and the Assad regime,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cAnd it would increase the risk that Isis and other terrorist groups regroup.\u201d He added: \u201cAs we learned the hard way during the Obama administration, American interests are best served by American leadership, not by retreat or withdrawal.\u201d The criticism was significant because McConnell is usually at pains not to cross Trump even at his most capricious. Last week the Kentucky senator released a Facebook video promising to stop Democratic-led impeachment in its tracks. The unusual fracture emerged on Sunday night when, shortly after a phone conversation between Trump and Turkey\u2019s president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, the White House announced removal of US troops from the Syria-Turkey border area. \u201cTurkey will soon be moving forward with its long-planned operation into Northern Syria,\u201d it added. Critics of all political stripes have long feared that the move could open the way for a Turkish strike on Kurdish-led fighters in the area. Kurdish groups have fought alongside a small US presence in Syria to drive Islamic State militants from the region. The Republican backlash was rapid and potentially unnerving for a president whose fate is tethered to the party and the assumption that it will acquit him in the Senate if, as widely expected, the Democratic-led House of Representatives votes for impeachment. Lindsey Graham, the chairman of the Senate judiciary committee, who has become an outspoken defender (and frequent golf partner) of Trump, did not acquiesce this time. Abandonment of the Kurds would be \u201ca disaster in the making\u201d, he said, and \u201ca stain on America\u2019s honour\u201d.

That scheme was under strain, however, as Turkey wanted to establish military outposts deeper inside Syria and resettle non-Kurdish Syrian refugees in the designated safe zone. Those demands were opposed by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). </p> \n<p>In a phone conversation with Donald Trump on Sunday, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, appears to have told the US president he would no longer abide by the joint border arrangement and was preparing to invade.</p> \n<p>After the phone call, a White House statement (that showed signs of having been directly dictated by Trump) said: \u201cTurkey will soon be moving forward with its long-planned operation into northern Syria\u201d, adding that US forces were being removed from the area of operations.</p> \n<p>The SDF said on Monday its US partners had already begun withdrawing troops from areas along Turkey\u2019s border. Footage aired on the Kurdish news agency Hawar purportedly showed US armoured vehicles evacuating key positions in the border region.</p> \n<p>The SDF spokesman, Mustafa Bali, accused the US of leaving the area to \u201cturn into a war zone\u201d, adding that the SDF would \u201cdefend north-east <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria\">Syria</a> at all costs\u201d.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday Syria\u2019s deputy foreign minister Faisal Mekdad called on the country\u2019s Kurds to rejoin the government side. \u201cThe homeland welcomes all its sons and Damascus will solve all Syrian problems in a positive way, away from violence,\u201d Mekdad said in an interview with a pro-government paper.</p> \n<p>The Turkish defence ministry declared in a Twitter post late on Monday: \u201cAll preparations for a possible military operation into northeastern Syria are completed \u2026 Establishment of a safe zone is essential to contribute to stability and peace of the region and for Syrians to live in safety.\u201d</p> \n<p>After a furious political backlash from US conservatives, in which Trump was accused of betraying the Kurdish fighters who look the lead in defeating Isis, the Trump administration insisted that the US had not endorsed a Turkish offensive.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt appears that the Turks are intent on some sort of military operation, possibly combined with an effort to resettle refugees,\u201d a senior administration official said. \u201cThe president made it very clear publicly and privately that the US does not endorse or support any Turkish operation in northern Syria, or there\u2019ll be no US armed forces involvement, or support for any operation that the Turks undertake.\u201d</p> \n<p>In a sign of disapproval, the Pentagon ended a two-week-old confidence-building effort in which US and Turkish air forces collaborated in counter-terrorist operations, and the US also cut Turkey off the flow of intelligence from drone video feeds over Syria.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean the Turks can\u2019t fly over Syria. That just means they can\u2019t fly with the US,\u201d said Aaron Stein, the director of the Middle East programme and the Foreign Policy Research Institute. \u201cThe DoD [defence department] is trying to signal the consequences to Turkey, and they don\u2019t want to look complicit in what is about to happen.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/10/archive-zip/giv-3902NbylSj6XOcCI/\" data-alt=\"Syria map\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/10/archive-zip/giv-3902NbylSj6XOcCI/\">Syria map</a> \n</figure> \n<p>The administration official said that an estimated 50 to 100 US special forces soldiers were being pulled back from the 30km safe zone on the border, but would not be leaving Syria, but redeployed instead to more secure positions inside the country.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis does not constitute a withdrawal from Syria,\u201d the official said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a small number of troops that will move to other bases within Syria.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cThe fact that we\u2019re removing them is not a green light,\u201d the official said. He added that Turkey would be held responsible if Isis detainees held by the SDF were able to escape as a result of the Turkish offensive, or if war crimes were committed. He pointed to a tweet on Monday by the president warning of repercussions.</p> \n<p>\u201cAs I have stated strongly before, and just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I\u2019ve done before!),\u201d Trump\u2019s tweet said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"89ffec43-8f1e-4104-8b79-2edf18ba3995\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nafbRKvoNmI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The confusion over US policy has followed a familiar pattern of the Trump presidency in which the president appears to dramatically alter course in an informal conversation with a foreign leader, follow up with a series of tweets, and leave the administration to try to rationalise, downplay or mitigate Trump\u2019s impulses.</p> \n<p>As has often been the case, Washington\u2019s European allies \u2013 UK, France and Germany \u2013 were not given advance notice of Trump\u2019s Sunday night statement, though the administration official insisted that senior US administration officials had been informed.</p> \n<p>The background briefings provided by officials appeared to be at odds with what Trump himself has said.

      "bodyText": "Kurdish forces in Syria have said the fate of tens of thousands of suspected Islamic State fighters and their families is uncertain, after US forces began a sudden withdrawal from the Turkish-Syrian border, leaving their Kurdish allies to face the prospect of a Turkish invasion alone. The effects of the shock retreat reverberated through the region on Monday as Turkish forces massed near the border with the Kurdish stronghold of north-eastern Syria. The threat of a Turkish offensive marks the end of a US-Turkish arrangement established in August that saw troops from both countries carrying out joint patrols in a \u201csafe zone\u201d along the border keeping Turkish and Kurdish forces apart. That scheme was under strain, however, as Turkey wanted to establish military outposts deeper inside Syria and resettle non-Kurdish Syrian refugees in the designated safe zone. Those demands were opposed by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). In a phone conversation with Donald Trump on Sunday, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, appears to have told the US president he would no longer abide by the joint border arrangement and was preparing to invade. After the phone call, a White House statement (that showed signs of having been directly dictated by Trump) said: \u201cTurkey will soon be moving forward with its long-planned operation into northern Syria\u201d, adding that US forces were being removed from the area of operations. The SDF said on Monday its US partners had already begun withdrawing troops from areas along Turkey\u2019s border. Footage aired on the Kurdish news agency Hawar purportedly showed US armoured vehicles evacuating key positions in the border region. The SDF spokesman, Mustafa Bali, accused the US of leaving the area to \u201cturn into a war zone\u201d, adding that the SDF would \u201cdefend north-east Syria at all costs\u201d. On Tuesday Syria\u2019s deputy foreign minister Faisal Mekdad called on the country\u2019s Kurds to rejoin the government side. \u201cThe homeland welcomes all its sons and Damascus will solve all Syrian problems in a positive way, away from violence,\u201d Mekdad said in an interview with a pro-government paper. The Turkish defence ministry declared in a Twitter post late on Monday: \u201cAll preparations for a possible military operation into northeastern Syria are completed \u2026 Establishment of a safe zone is essential to contribute to stability and peace of the region and for Syrians to live in safety.\u201d After a furious political backlash from US conservatives, in which Trump was accused of betraying the Kurdish fighters who look the lead in defeating Isis, the Trump administration insisted that the US had not endorsed a Turkish offensive. \u201cIt appears that the Turks are intent on some sort of military operation, possibly combined with an effort to resettle refugees,\u201d a senior administration official said. \u201cThe president made it very clear publicly and privately that the US does not endorse or support any Turkish operation in northern Syria, or there\u2019ll be no US armed forces involvement, or support for any operation that the Turks undertake.\u201d In a sign of disapproval, the Pentagon ended a two-week-old confidence-building effort in which US and Turkish air forces collaborated in counter-terrorist operations, and the US also cut Turkey off the flow of intelligence from drone video feeds over Syria. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean the Turks can\u2019t fly over Syria. That just means they can\u2019t fly with the US,\u201d said Aaron Stein, the director of the Middle East programme and the Foreign Policy Research Institute. \u201cThe DoD [defence department] is trying to signal the consequences to Turkey, and they don\u2019t want to look complicit in what is about to happen.\u201d The administration official said that an estimated 50 to 100 US special forces soldiers were being pulled back from the 30km safe zone on the border, but would not be leaving Syria, but redeployed instead to more secure positions inside the country. \u201cThis does not constitute a withdrawal from Syria,\u201d the official said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a small number of troops that will move to other bases within Syria.\u201d \u201cThe fact that we\u2019re removing them is not a green light,\u201d the official said. He added that Turkey would be held responsible if Isis detainees held by the SDF were able to escape as a result of the Turkish offensive, or if war crimes were committed. He pointed to a tweet on Monday by the president warning of repercussions. \u201cAs I have stated strongly before, and just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I\u2019ve done before!),\u201d Trump\u2019s tweet said. The confusion over US policy has followed a familiar pattern of the Trump presidency in which the president appears to dramatically alter course in an informal conversation with a foreign leader, follow up with a series of tweets, and leave the administration to try to rationalise, downplay or mitigate Trump\u2019s impulses. As has often been the case, Washington\u2019s European allies \u2013 UK, France and Germany \u2013 were not given advance notice of Trump\u2019s Sunday night statement, though the administration official insisted that senior US administration officials had been informed. The background briefings provided by officials appeared to be at odds with what Trump himself has said. The White House statement issued on Sunday night gave no hint that the president disapproved of a Turkish offensive. Furthermore in his later tweets, Trump was adamant that the US troops withdrawn from the border would be brought back to the US, not redeployed inside Syria. In his tweets, Trump had appeared unsentimental about the Kurds, noting that they had been paid \u201cmassive amounts of money and equipment\u201d in the four-year campaign, when they were used as the main US proxy to fight Isis in Syria. But the issue of Isis foreign fighters, most of them European, has clearly preoccupied the US president. Both Trump and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have repeatedly called on European states to repatriate around 20,000 foreign nationals currently held in north-east Syria for trial and rehabilitation at home. Trump argued it was up to Turkey and Europe and others, \u201cto watch over the captured Isis fighters and families\u201d. An SDF spokesman, Amjed Osman, said on Monday it was not clear what would happen to the prisoners. \u201cWe repeatedly called for foreign states to take responsibility for their Isis nationals. But there was no response,\u201d he said in a statement. It is far from clear if Turkey has the capacity \u2013 or desire \u2013 to take custody of the detainees being held in crowded Kurdish jails and displacement camps, stretching the SDF to its limits and prompting warnings that militants are using the prisons to regroup. Some 74,000 women and children of the caliphate are held at the infamous Hawl camp, where they are guarded by just 400 SDF soldiers. But the camp, a hotbed of violence and extremist ideology, falls outside the parameters of the 32km-deep safe zone on the Turkish-Syrian border that Erdogan has said his forces would establish. The administration official briefing the press had claimed, wrongly, that the camps were inside the border zone. Aid agencies warned that an offensive could displace hundreds of thousands of people, and create a new humanitarian disaster. Save the Children said that more than 9,000 children from 40 countries were being held in camps and depended on humanitarian aid to survive. \u201cReports of imminent military operations and troops already sent to the border are deeply troubling. The international community, including the UK, should take urgent steps to do what\u2019s best for these children and bring them to their home countries before access becomes even more unpredictable,\u201d the group said. The Guardian understands that the SAS and French special forces present in Rojava would be tasked with securing the camp perimeters if the Kurds withdrew.

For SSE, technology is central to its vision of the future. \u201cWe have already kicked off a period of digital transformation: improving our data collection and analysis, overhauling our use of Salesforce, staying ahead of the curve with GDPR, and exploring how we can better connect our community of learners,\u201d says Hobson. Robust data analysis is crucial to its impact measurement, and it will soon be recruiting more digital talent to keep them ahead of the curve. The applied futurist Of course, social innovation is no longer the preserve of charities \u2013 increasingly, it\u2019s a badge of honour for both corporations and consumers. \u201cAt levels from the individual to the global, and particularly in local communities, we\u2019re seeing new behaviours and organisations spring up that are making change without waiting for anyone\u2019s permission,\u201d says Tom Cheesewright, applied futurist and author of High Frequency Change. \u201cCompanies can engage by recognising this trend, making space for changemakers, supporting them, and listening to them,\u201d he says. How can businesses best support their future changemakers? Cheesewright has an intriguing suggestion. \u201cThe recipe is simple: make them work fewer hours,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have an enormous issue with productivity in UK PLC and part of that is presenteeism, the idea that hard work equates to long working hours. If we shorten the working day, and allow more flexibility in it, then we create happier and more productive employees who have the time to engage.\u201d Not all employees will use the extra time to further positive causes, of course, but with technology stripping ever-more sophisticated tasks from our working days, it seems that something has to change. \u201cThe value of humans in the workforce is increasingly about creativity and original analysis that requires focus. And we can\u2019t focus for eight hours a day. So eventually employers will have to allow people to work to rhythms that maximise their performance,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is a cultural change, so it will be slow. But I expect we\u2019ll see a large shift in the flexibility of work and the expected hours over the next 20 years.\u201d To learn more about Salesforce.org \u2018Changemaker Correspondents\u2019, visit Salesforce.org/changemaker",

True, she had a skill named after her on floor but so do a lot of people. What made Biles special in the early years of her senior career was her capacity for difficult skills, the fact that she could do more of them in a single routine than most could, and the seeming ease with which she performed these incredibly difficult elements. But since the 2016 Olympics, Biles has placed a special emphasis on bringing new skills into the sport. The double double off beam is the third skill she\u2019s introduced since 2018.</p> <p>Biles said that she believed that a different gymnast from a different country would\u2019ve been given the higher value. She seems to feel that this was deliberately targeted at her. \u201cAm I in a league of my own? Yes, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t credit me for what I\u2019m doing.\u201d Since returning from her post-Rio hiatus, Biles has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/08/simone-biles-usa-gymnastics-larry-nassar-abuse\">far more outspoken than she was before</a>, whether it\u2019s about corruption in USA Gymnastics, abuse, her own place in the sport, and now, something as arcane as skill values.</p> <p>And the fact that we are even having this conversation about letter assignments to skills in women\u2019s gymnastics in mainstream sports media is a testament to Biles\u2019 broader significance. Typically these conversations are had in Facebook groups devoted to the sport or on gymnastics Twitter. But anything that affects Biles becomes top sports news, no matter how in the weeds. Such is the power of Simone.</p> <p>And because of Biles\u2019 outspokenness on the issue, the WTC was forced to respond and explain why they evaluated the dismount the way they did. They wrote in a statement that said that they take a lot of things into account when deciding how to assign values to a skill. It\u2019s not just about how hard the skill is. The committee is also concerned with incentivizing elements that might result in injury. \u201cThere is an added risk in landing of double saltos for beam dismounts (with/without twists), including a potential landing on the neck,\u201d the <a href=\"https://www.gymnastics.sport/site/news/displaynews.php?idNews=2680&amp;fbclid=IwAR2FsACtEkZageifJkKjXDEGg2TjvQOT7WMLggWOmVVN7vvCz_QYXIC1qq4\">statement</a> read.</p> <p>One of the examples they cited was how they reduced the rating of the double front on vault, which is named after Russian gymnast Elena Produnova, after years of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwi-oAraJ_Q\">terrifying landings</a> that could\u2019ve resulted in serious injury.</p> <p>Like Biles, I call bullshit on this.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e39f4ace5eed8c782ad11321d26aec454d68d4d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e39f4ace5eed8c782ad11321d26aec454d68d4d4/0_0_4294_2862/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Simone Biles\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simone Biles can break the record for most medals won by any gymnast at this week\u2019s world championships.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lionel Bonaventure/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>First of all, beam and vault are not directly comparable. Vault is essentially a single skill. The only way to up your D-score is to do a harder vault, hence some gymnasts attempting to perform vaults that seem far above their ability to execute them cleanly and safely. On the other events, gymnasts perform routines with several skills, often done in combination. This means that there are many opportunities for a gymnast to earn extra tenths. You don\u2019t need to chuck a super-hard dismount; you can do a super-hard skill inside the routine. Or you can do two medium difficulty skills consecutively to earn connection value. On vault, there is just one way to skin a cat; on beam, there are many.</p> <p>And the WTC has already incentivized gymnasts who want to do easier beam dismounts by no longer counting that element towards the composition requirements of the routine. Before, if you did a D or higher, you got .5 (on top of the difficulty value of the skill). For a C, you only got .3 and for an A or B, you got nothing. You can see how the old rules could potentially push a gymnast to do a more challenging dismount, perhaps more difficult than they could physically handle. Since the change, we\u2019ve seen more gymnasts go for simpler dismounts, executed cleanly and safely. If the goal is to get more gymnasts to do beautiful, clean gymnastics then mission accomplished. And the Biles dismount in no way detracts from this. Biles, typically lauded for her difficulty, is also one the most technically sound gymnasts out on the floor. She does the double double off the beam in a tight tuck, with her knees and feet together. She finishes the rotation with enough time to kick out of it and lands it far better than gymnasts performing \u201cjust\u201d a double back, no twists.</p> <p>It\u2019s also highly implausible that too high a rating on the Biles dismount would incentivize gymnasts to throw the risky dismount when almost no one performs a full twisting double back dismount, despite it being rated a G, three levels up from the double tuck. This skill, which was introduced back in the 80s, is still only performed by a handful of gymnasts, one of which is Biles (when she\u2019s not doing her eponymous skill). Let\u2019s first see a bunch of gymnasts trying a full twisting double back before we even start worrying about the Biles.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know if this is any comfort to Biles, but she\u2019s hardly the first gymnast to see her innovation undervalued by the WTC. In 1995, Chinese gymnast Liu Xuan introduced a one arm giant swing to the uneven bars and connected into a release skill. Back then, the ratings of skills went from A to E. The innovative skill \u2013 which was surely very difficult too \u2013 was only rated a C. Though the WTC didn\u2019t comment at the time, it was assumed that they were hoping to discourage gymnasts from doing the skill by giving it such a low rating.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtfRVEmVJMo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VtfRVEmVJMo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>At a C, it was hardly worth the risk that it took to perform it so she eventually stopped doing it. It remains in the Code but has been downgraded ever further to a B. It\u2019s basically worthless now. We won\u2019t ever see it in the women\u2019s competition again. (But if you happen to be a fan of one arm giants, fret not: they\u2019re a mainstay of men\u2019s high bar where they\u2019ve never been discouraged.)</p> <p>There\u2019s an important distinction between what happened to Liu in the mid 1990s and what\u2019s happening to Biles now: the Biles dismount is still the highest rated beam dismount in the Code of Points, even if it\u2019s not worth as much as she had hoped it would be, but it\u2019s still worth a lot whereas Liu\u2019s skill didn\u2019t even get close to what was the highest rating back in the day. Liu, more than Biles, was the one being disincentivized from doing it.</p> <p>Whether the double double is rated an H, a J, or even a lowly C, it will have no impact on the results. The US team will walk away with their fifth straight world team title and Biles will win her fifth all-around gold. But the judges and officials haven\u2019t done what they routinely demand from the gymnasts \u2013 to perform cleanly and consistently. They\u2019ve made a big ol\u2019 mess of things.</p> <p>And Biles, like other gymnasts in the past, are the one who are forced to pay for the mistakes and miscalculations of others.</p>",

She seems to feel that this was deliberately targeted at her. \u201cAm I in a league of my own? Yes, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t credit me for what I\u2019m doing.\u201d Since returning from her post-Rio hiatus, Biles has been far more outspoken than she was before, whether it\u2019s about corruption in USA Gymnastics, abuse, her own place in the sport, and now, something as arcane as skill values. And the fact that we are even having this conversation about letter assignments to skills in women\u2019s gymnastics in mainstream sports media is a testament to Biles\u2019 broader significance. Typically these conversations are had in Facebook groups devoted to the sport or on gymnastics Twitter. But anything that affects Biles becomes top sports news, no matter how in the weeds. Such is the power of Simone. And because of Biles\u2019 outspokenness on the issue, the WTC was forced to respond and explain why they evaluated the dismount the way they did. They wrote in a statement that said that they take a lot of things into account when deciding how to assign values to a skill. It\u2019s not just about how hard the skill is. The committee is also concerned with incentivizing elements that might result in injury. \u201cThere is an added risk in landing of double saltos for beam dismounts (with/without twists), including a potential landing on the neck,\u201d the statement read. One of the examples they cited was how they reduced the rating of the double front on vault, which is named after Russian gymnast Elena Produnova, after years of terrifying landings that could\u2019ve resulted in serious injury. Like Biles, I call bullshit on this. First of all, beam and vault are not directly comparable. Vault is essentially a single skill. The only way to up your D-score is to do a harder vault, hence some gymnasts attempting to perform vaults that seem far above their ability to execute them cleanly and safely. On the other events, gymnasts perform routines with several skills, often done in combination. This means that there are many opportunities for a gymnast to earn extra tenths. You don\u2019t need to chuck a super-hard dismount; you can do a super-hard skill inside the routine. Or you can do two medium difficulty skills consecutively to earn connection value. On vault, there is just one way to skin a cat; on beam, there are many. And the WTC has already incentivized gymnasts who want to do easier beam dismounts by no longer counting that element towards the composition requirements of the routine. Before, if you did a D or higher, you got .5 (on top of the difficulty value of the skill). For a C, you only got .3 and for an A or B, you got nothing. You can see how the old rules could potentially push a gymnast to do a more challenging dismount, perhaps more difficult than they could physically handle. Since the change, we\u2019ve seen more gymnasts go for simpler dismounts, executed cleanly and safely. If the goal is to get more gymnasts to do beautiful, clean gymnastics then mission accomplished. And the Biles dismount in no way detracts from this. Biles, typically lauded for her difficulty, is also one the most technically sound gymnasts out on the floor. She does the double double off the beam in a tight tuck, with her knees and feet together. She finishes the rotation with enough time to kick out of it and lands it far better than gymnasts performing \u201cjust\u201d a double back, no twists. It\u2019s also highly implausible that too high a rating on the Biles dismount would incentivize gymnasts to throw the risky dismount when almost no one performs a full twisting double back dismount, despite it being rated a G, three levels up from the double tuck. This skill, which was introduced back in the 80s, is still only performed by a handful of gymnasts, one of which is Biles (when she\u2019s not doing her eponymous skill). Let\u2019s first see a bunch of gymnasts trying a full twisting double back before we even start worrying about the Biles. I don\u2019t know if this is any comfort to Biles, but she\u2019s hardly the first gymnast to see her innovation undervalued by the WTC. In 1995, Chinese gymnast Liu Xuan introduced a one arm giant swing to the uneven bars and connected into a release skill. Back then, the ratings of skills went from A to E. The innovative skill \u2013 which was surely very difficult too \u2013 was only rated a C. Though the WTC didn\u2019t comment at the time, it was assumed that they were hoping to discourage gymnasts from doing the skill by giving it such a low rating. At a C, it was hardly worth the risk that it took to perform it so she eventually stopped doing it. It remains in the Code but has been downgraded ever further to a B. It\u2019s basically worthless now. We won\u2019t ever see it in the women\u2019s competition again. (But if you happen to be a fan of one arm giants, fret not: they\u2019re a mainstay of men\u2019s high bar where they\u2019ve never been discouraged.) There\u2019s an important distinction between what happened to Liu in the mid 1990s and what\u2019s happening to Biles now: the Biles dismount is still the highest rated beam dismount in the Code of Points, even if it\u2019s not worth as much as she had hoped it would be, but it\u2019s still worth a lot whereas Liu\u2019s skill didn\u2019t even get close to what was the highest rating back in the day. Liu, more than Biles, was the one being disincentivized from doing it. Whether the double double is rated an H, a J, or even a lowly C, it will have no impact on the results. The US team will walk away with their fifth straight world team title and Biles will win her fifth all-around gold. But the judges and officials haven\u2019t done what they routinely demand from the gymnasts \u2013 to perform cleanly and consistently. They\u2019ve made a big ol\u2019 mess of things. And Biles, like other gymnasts in the past, are the one who are forced to pay for the mistakes and miscalculations of others.",

But he could creep up so close behind it as to make the end of the hunt a formality, as three of his four runners at Brighton and Chelmsford are priced at 2-1 or shorter.</p> \n<p>He has another seven declared on Wednesday and plenty of possibles for later in the week. Good luck to him, to all his runners and to everyone at Kingsley Park who has put the stable in this position.</p> \n<h2>Tuesday\u2019s best bets</h2> \n<p>Racing goes ahead at Leicester, which means we get to see if <strong>Eponina (5.05)</strong> can build on the promise she showed last time when beaten half a length at Thirsk. That was her best effort since midsummer, when she made all on soft ground at Chester. This step back down to seven furlongs should help and 11-2 looks big to me.</p> \n<p>Stallone is the obvious one, having run well in a much hotter race last week. But an extra furlong on this ground is no joke, so soon after such an effort, and his stable hasn\u2019t had a winner for six weeks.</p> \n<p><strong>Tarboosh (2.55)</strong> is the nap at even money, earlier on the card. This is more competitive than your average three-runner race but it was easy to like the way he sluiced through the mud at Beverley a fortnight ago.</p> \n<p>The ground should be much less testing at Brighton, where <strong>Global Agreement (2.00)</strong> is interesting at 9-2. The chestnut had no luck on his handicap debut when drawn wide at Bath and had to go all around the houses on his way to finishing a close fourth. It was an excellent effort and he can fare better from the same mark here.</p> \n<p>Chelmsford also stages a three-runner race, in which <strong>Habub (6.10)</strong> is the lowest-rated in the line-up. But he\u2019s won on the surface and, most importantly, looks like getting the lead to himself, which should make him really dangerous under the in-form Jim Crowley. He\u2019s 6-4 from 2-1 after early support.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"08396067-b167-4e42-823b-02df9e2ba07a\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Chris Cook's tips</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Leicester&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p><b>1.50</b> Tigerskin <b>2.20</b> Goodwood Sonnet <b>2.55</b> Tarboosh (nap) <b>3.25</b> Indianapolis <b>4.00</b> Karisoke <b>4.35</b> Elzaam's Dream <b>5.05</b> Eponina (nb) <b>5.35</b> Another Boy&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Brighton&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p><b>2.00</b> Global Agreement <b>2.30</b> Overwrite <b>3.05</b> Kyllachys Tale <b>3.35</b> Oleksander <b>4.10</b> Tremwedge <b>4.45</b> Necoleta <b>5.15</b> Firenze Rosa</p>\n    <p><b>Chelmsford&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p><b>4.40</b> Dragon Command <b>5.10</b> Alcance <b>5.40</b> Chairman Power <b>6.10</b> Habub <b>6.40</b> Spice War <b>7.10</b> Dr Jekyll <b>7.40</b> Mrs Ivy <b>8.10</b> Poetic Legacy&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><i>Catterick abandoned due to waterlogging</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

But Brexit works in wonderful ways \u2013 and EU officials are not at all convinced, anyway, that the monologue in question, attributed to Boris Johnson\u2019s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, is really aimed at them. On Monday evening, shortly after the EU\u2019s comprehensive point-by-point deconstruction of the British proposals was published by the Guardian, the Spectator\u2019s political editor, James Forsyth, made public a text he had received from a \u201ccontact in Number 10\u201d on the state of play. The No 10 official admitted to Forsyth \u2013 who works with Cummings\u2019 wife, Mary Wakefield, at the Spectator \u2013 that the talks in Brussels would probably end this week as \u201c[Leo] Varadkar doesn\u2019t want to negotiate\u201d. Ireland\u2019s prime minister was said to have \u201cgone back on his word\u201d by attacking the British government\u2019s proposals rather than shifting the EU\u2019s position in response to British moves on an all-Ireland regulatory zone for goods. Varadkar was said to be gambling on a second referendum, and was pulling the strings of the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier. \u201cAt the end of this week they may say: \u2018OK, let\u2019s do a Northern Ireland-only backstop with a time limit\u2019, which is what various players have been hinting at, then we\u2019ll say no, and that will probably be the end,\u201d Forsyth\u2019s Downing Street source wrote. The text message\u2019s verbose author goes on to claim that the result would be one of two outcomes: no deal on 31 October or a general election, in which the Conservative party morphs into the Brexit party, promising to deliver no deal. The view in Brussels is that the message was not intended for EU consumption. In part that is because it is riddled with misunderstandings of how the EU works. In securing the first outcome of a no deal on 31 October, the writer appears to admit there is no legal avenue to avoid the prime minister seeking an extension by 19 October.

Amber Rudd, the former work and pensions secretary, who left the parliamentary Conservative party to become an independent MP, said she believed the note, which was not denied by N0 10, will have come from Johnson\u2019s powerful adviser Dominic Cummings because of the language in it.

      "body": "<p>In July 2019, Barnet council\u2019s children and family services department received a \u201cgood\u201d rating from Ofsted. It was a fantastic moment, says Brigitte Jordaan, director of children social care at the borough \u2013 but it was just the start of its ongoing improvement journey. \u201cWe allowed everyone a little bit of time to understand and enjoy the significance of our achievement,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we quickly regrouped to say: we don\u2019t stop here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHaving been recognised as a good authority means that we have the systems and ability to provide a good service for every child. What we need to make sure is that we consistently do our best for every child. We\u2019re not complacent. We\u2019re now moving into the next phase of our work for families, because we know where the improvement gaps remain. We know what we need to do to make sure that every child and family gets the best possible service.\u201d</p> <p>The department had been through some tough times: just two years before, Ofsted had rated it \u201cinadequate\u201d, citing issues such as lack of good training, problems recruiting and retaining permanent staff, and unfocused intervention. But leaders took action rapidly to get the department back on track in its vital work with children at risk.</p> <p>They immediately introduced a team of practice development workers: experienced social workers who would work alongside the existing team to model good practice and to help them develop intervention skills, bringing training into day-to-day practice.

      "bodyText": "In July 2019, Barnet council\u2019s children and family services department received a \u201cgood\u201d rating from Ofsted. It was a fantastic moment, says Brigitte Jordaan, director of children social care at the borough \u2013 but it was just the start of its ongoing improvement journey. \u201cWe allowed everyone a little bit of time to understand and enjoy the significance of our achievement,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we quickly regrouped to say: we don\u2019t stop here.\u201d \u201cHaving been recognised as a good authority means that we have the systems and ability to provide a good service for every child. What we need to make sure is that we consistently do our best for every child. We\u2019re not complacent. We\u2019re now moving into the next phase of our work for families, because we know where the improvement gaps remain. We know what we need to do to make sure that every child and family gets the best possible service.\u201d The department had been through some tough times: just two years before, Ofsted had rated it \u201cinadequate\u201d, citing issues such as lack of good training, problems recruiting and retaining permanent staff, and unfocused intervention. But leaders took action rapidly to get the department back on track in its vital work with children at risk. They immediately introduced a team of practice development workers: experienced social workers who would work alongside the existing team to model good practice and to help them develop intervention skills, bringing training into day-to-day practice. More time for reflection was also encouraged. \u201cThe practice development team was invaluable,\u201d says social worker Tom Jones, who started work at Barnet four months after the 2017 report. \u201cManagement identified practice points that we needed help with, such as domestic violence, or how to engage with very young children.

      "body": "<p>In 1965 Robbie Robertson was living in the room next to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/bobdylan\" title=\"\">Bob Dylan\u2019s</a> at New York\u2019s Chelsea hotel. This was when Dylan was writing <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/inside-bob-dylans-blonde-on-blonde-rocks-first-great-double-album-164769/\" title=\"\">Blonde on Blonde</a>. \u201cThe television was on. There was music playing. The phone was ringing. There were people coming and going \u2013 and he was writing away on his typewriter. I thought, \u2018I don\u2019t even understand how somebody can close off the outside world like that and concentrate. This guy is from another planet,\u2019\u201d Robertson says. But for a while he shared that planet, or came as close to sharing it as any musician did at the time.</p> <p>Robertson was the lead guitarist of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/aug/17/the-band-10-of-the-best-levon-helm-robbie-robertson\" title=\"\">the Band</a> (then known as The Hawks), the five-piece group that backed Dylan in his early days as an electric act: essentially, they supplied the noise that the acoustic-loving crowds booed on tour. But while the collaboration changed the course of music history, it had another, quieter and more personal effect on the Band, shifting the dynamics of what Robertson calls their \u201cbrotherhood\u201d, the way the five of them related.</p> <p>This \u201cbrotherhood\u201d is clearly on Robertson\u2019s mind, because after a lifetime of writing steadfastly unautobiographical songs, the most powerful track on his new solo album, <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/robbie-robertson-returns-with-sinematic-887986/\" title=\"\">Sinematic</a>, mourns the demise of his band family \u2013 three of whom are dead. His new documentary, <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/film/reviews/once-were-brothers-robbie-robertson-review-1203324925/\" title=\"\">Once Were Brothers</a>, which shares its title with that song, sees Robertson pottering around his music room, looking back on what made the Band tick as a collective, and what he lost in losing them. It is fair to say he is in a memoiristic phase.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7670a96adbb6a2a5f0a1835bd7457f7f0537eb3b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7670a96adbb6a2a5f0a1835bd7457f7f0537eb3b/0_0_3600_2267/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Band at Woodstock, 1968 (from left): Richard Manuel, Robbie Robertson, Levon Helm, Garth Hudson and Rick Danko.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"630\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Band at Woodstock, 1968 (from left): Richard Manuel, Robbie Robertson, Levon Helm, Garth Hudson and Rick Danko.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elliott Landy/LandyVision, Inc</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cFor a long time I thought I wanted to be private,\u201d Robertson says, on the phone from Los Angeles, where he lives. \u201cBut at this stage\u201d \u2013 he is 76 \u2013 \u201cit all comes flowing out and I can\u2019t stop it. I would put our story up against any musical group in the history of the world.\u201d</p> <p>Eric Clapton, Bruce Springsteen, Van Morrison, Martin Scorsese (the film\u2019s executive producer) and George Harrison \u2013 as well as Dylan \u2013 are among the greats happy to say how great the Band, and Robertson in particular, were. Clapton even disbanded Cream \u2013 whose sound had become increasingly strident \u2013 after he heard their debut album, Music From Big Pink, in 1968, with its quiet, homespun roots air.

They became so close that Robertson was the only witness to Dylan\u2019s wedding to Sara Lownds in 1965. And then, of course, there were the electric tours, all those angry audiences. \u201cIt was like we went through the war together,\u201d Robertson says. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be in it for ever, just because of what we went through.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen people boo you night after night, it can affect your confidence. Anybody else would have said, \u2018Well, the audience isn\u2019t liking this, let\u2019s change what we\u2019re doing.\u2019 We didn\u2019t budge. We went out there and just played this music and the more they booed, the louder we got. Inside of us we felt, \u2018This is a revolution. And we\u2019re part of this revolution, and we\u2019re going to go through with it.\u201d Later, of course, came The Basement Tapes \u2013 weeks of laidback, lumberjack-shirted recordings with Dylan from the Band\u2019s Woodstock home.</p> <p>In this light, Dylan\u2019s contribution to Robertson\u2019s documentary \u2013 the Band were \u201cgallant knights\u201d for standing behind him \u2013 seems slight.

Robertson was the only member of the Band not to feature in Dylan\u2019s 30th anniversary celebration in Madison Square Gardens in 1993.

Sinematic was released this month, he is writing the second volume of his autobiography and assembling the 50th anniversary collection of the Band, out in November. \u201cI\u2019m not lazy!\u201d he exclaims, a realisation he describes as \u201ca wake-up call\u201d but he sounds happy to be busy, and I\u2019m not convinced it\u2019s news to him.</p> <p>\u201cI am so into what I am doing now,\u201d he says. \u201cI do revisit special things in my heart about this brotherhood. But I\u2019m very much, like, 90% of it is what I\u2019m doing today and what I need to do tomorrow. I\u2019m always wanting to move forward.\u201d</p> <p>It was Robertson who organised the Band\u2019s farewell concert, The Last Waltz, in 1976, partly, he says, \u201cbecause of my deep concerns for Richard [Manuel]\u2019s wellbeing. It was shattering to me when Richard died. I was afraid of this for many years. The idea was to be protective. Because although we were all riding in the caravan, some people were much more vulnerable to the disease of addiction than others.\u201d</p> <p>Dylan, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, Van Morrison and others contributed to the show, which Scorsese also filmed \u2013 the start of a long working relationship. Robertson hoped that afterwards the Band would regroup in the studio. But he was the only one to turn up. He has always depicted the end of the Band as a surprise \u2013 but this seems at odds with the concept of a supremely elaborate farewell concert.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjtPBjEz-BA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MjtPBjEz-BA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cOur plan was we were going to put the road aside, to take a break. And then, as I said in the film, when I realised everybody forgot to come back, I had to read the writing on the wall,\u201d he says.</p> <p>That word \u201cforgot\u201d feels like a bit of a narrative liberty. After all, the other members of the Band reunited in 1983. Even after Manuel died in 1986, Hudson, Helm and Danko carried on \u2013 without Robertson. So didn\u2019t he leave them? \u201cThey got in touch and said, \u2018We want to go out and do some playing, and is it OK that we use the name the Band?\u2019 Because they didn\u2019t have a creative outlet like me.\u201d By then Robertson was writing music for film.</p> <p>\u201cI said, \u2018Guys, go ahead. If you want to go in and make a beautiful record, I\u2019m first in line. But I\u2019m not going back on the road with you.\u2019 I knew what was going on with Richard, Rick and Levon, still. And I had this fear inside. It could be dark. And it could be dangerous. And as it turned out, it was.\u201d</p> <p>I can\u2019t help wondering whether memoir is a way to self-soothe, to sort through the difficult circumstances that led to the Band\u2019s demise, the pain of the distance from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/apr/19/levon-helm\" title=\"\">Helm</a> in particular towards the end of his life. But Robertson sounds perplexed by the question. He says he is only celebrating their amazing journey.</p> <p>The other living member of the brotherhood is Hudson, who is 82 and lives in Woodstock. Archive audio of his voice features in this documentary, but no new interview. \u201cGarth is a recluse and he doesn\u2019t talk,\u201d Robertson says. \u201cHe has a health issue. I don\u2019t think it would be respectful to Garth to show that he is not feeling that well, and to not be able to show him in a shining light.\u201d</p> <p>So it falls to Robertson to tell the Band\u2019s story and, by telling it, to own it. Does this inequality with his brothers trouble him, especially since at its heart the Band was a celebration of the collective?</p> <p>\u201cInequality to the other guys?\u201d he asks, sounding puzzled. \u201cLike I said, early on they just kind of pushed me out there and said, \u2018Tell them what we\u2019re trying to say.\u2019 And because I was the creative writer in this group, and I also have the ability to \u2026 whatever you call it ... lead the charge, everybody enjoyed that I would take that responsibility. That I would do the dirty work in that way. So it fell on me. It fell on me and I respect it and I try to tell the most honest version of the story I can.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a fair point, yet for a memoirist, he seems pretty averse to reflection. \u201cI\u2019m not going to get moopy or soppy or mushy,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just not the cloth I\u2019m cut from.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 Robbie Robertson\u2019s album Sinematic is out now.

      "bodyText": "In 1965 Robbie Robertson was living in the room next to Bob Dylan\u2019s at New York\u2019s Chelsea hotel. This was when Dylan was writing Blonde on Blonde. \u201cThe television was on. There was music playing. The phone was ringing. There were people coming and going \u2013 and he was writing away on his typewriter. I thought, \u2018I don\u2019t even understand how somebody can close off the outside world like that and concentrate. This guy is from another planet,\u2019\u201d Robertson says. But for a while he shared that planet, or came as close to sharing it as any musician did at the time. Robertson was the lead guitarist of the Band (then known as The Hawks), the five-piece group that backed Dylan in his early days as an electric act: essentially, they supplied the noise that the acoustic-loving crowds booed on tour. But while the collaboration changed the course of music history, it had another, quieter and more personal effect on the Band, shifting the dynamics of what Robertson calls their \u201cbrotherhood\u201d, the way the five of them related. This \u201cbrotherhood\u201d is clearly on Robertson\u2019s mind, because after a lifetime of writing steadfastly unautobiographical songs, the most powerful track on his new solo album, Sinematic, mourns the demise of his band family \u2013 three of whom are dead. His new documentary, Once Were Brothers, which shares its title with that song, sees Robertson pottering around his music room, looking back on what made the Band tick as a collective, and what he lost in losing them. It is fair to say he is in a memoiristic phase. \u201cFor a long time I thought I wanted to be private,\u201d Robertson says, on the phone from Los Angeles, where he lives. \u201cBut at this stage\u201d \u2013 he is 76 \u2013 \u201cit all comes flowing out and I can\u2019t stop it. I would put our story up against any musical group in the history of the world.\u201d Eric Clapton, Bruce Springsteen, Van Morrison, Martin Scorsese (the film\u2019s executive producer) and George Harrison \u2013 as well as Dylan \u2013 are among the greats happy to say how great the Band, and Robertson in particular, were. Clapton even disbanded Cream \u2013 whose sound had become increasingly strident \u2013 after he heard their debut album, Music From Big Pink, in 1968, with its quiet, homespun roots air. But while Robertson\u2019s music with the Band has touched the work of so many important musicians, he is still mostly regarded as interesting for whom he influenced rather than in his own right, like a person who has many claims to fame, but somehow isn\u2019t a celebrity himself. I wonder if he minds being of interest primarily for music that he made so long ago, for his relationship to, and impact on, other, more famous, musicians. \u201cIt\u2019s a big part of the journey and a big part of the story, and I completely understand that,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s not what I do. It\u2019s what I did.\u201d Robertson was born in Toronto. His mother, who was Mohawk, had grown up on the Six Nations of the Grand River Reserve, and as a child he used to visit family there. \u201cIt seemed to me that everybody played a musical instrument or sang or danced. I thought, \u2018I\u2019ve got to get in on this club!\u2019 I said, \u2018I think a guitar looks pretty cool.\u2019\u201d So his mother bought him one \u2013 with a cowboy painted on it. \u201cI thought it was very ironic that Indians would teach me to play guitar with a picture of a cowboy on.\u201d By 15 he was proficient enough to be hanging around rockabilly Ronnie Hawkins when he played in Toronto, captivated by Levon Helm on drums, sticks flying, white hair blazing and only three years Robertson\u2019s senior. \u201cHe seemed to glow in the dark,\u201d Robertson says. Robertson was an only child; Helm became a kind of sibling. \u201cWith Levon I was the younger brother, learning and growing.\u201d Fellow Canadians Rick Danko, Richard Manuel and Garth Hudson joined the band to complete the brotherhood, and after they split from Hawkins, they continued to play as Levon and the Hawks. Helm was the nominal leader, Hudson was classically trained and reclusive, Danko good-looking and soulful, and Manuel from the start was cherished as sensitive and vulnerable: \u201cFrom a very young age, we understood that Richard had a difficulty with alcohol and addiction,\u201d Robertson says. (Manuel killed himself when he was 42.) And what of Robertson? What part did he play in the brotherhood? \u201cEverybody did something that raised the level of what we were doing to a stronger place,\u201d he says. His \u201csomething\u201d was \u201cthe main part of the creative direction of where this group would go.\u201d He became less of a brother and more of an adult in the room. He negotiated with the band\u2019s manager \u2013 Albert Grossman, whom they shared with Dylan \u2013 took a growing charge of the songwriting and, as Danko, Helm and Manuel became increasingly interested in heroin, he tried to keep them focused on music. It must have been tough to play both parent and brother. Didn\u2019t it create a sense of difference between him and his bandmates? After all, Helm was critical of Robertson in his 1993 autobiography, This Wheel\u2019s on Fire, for the way he distributed songwriting credits (Robertson got most of them). \u201cI didn\u2019t feel any separate feeling,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat everybody gravitated to was what they could bring to the table.

Sinematic was released this month, he is writing the second volume of his autobiography and assembling the 50th anniversary collection of the Band, out in November. \u201cI\u2019m not lazy!\u201d he exclaims, a realisation he describes as \u201ca wake-up call\u201d but he sounds happy to be busy, and I\u2019m not convinced it\u2019s news to him. \u201cI am so into what I am doing now,\u201d he says. \u201cI do revisit special things in my heart about this brotherhood. But I\u2019m very much, like, 90% of it is what I\u2019m doing today and what I need to do tomorrow. I\u2019m always wanting to move forward.\u201d It was Robertson who organised the Band\u2019s farewell concert, The Last Waltz, in 1976, partly, he says, \u201cbecause of my deep concerns for Richard [Manuel]\u2019s wellbeing. It was shattering to me when Richard died. I was afraid of this for many years. The idea was to be protective. Because although we were all riding in the caravan, some people were much more vulnerable to the disease of addiction than others.\u201d Dylan, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, Van Morrison and others contributed to the show, which Scorsese also filmed \u2013 the start of a long working relationship. Robertson hoped that afterwards the Band would regroup in the studio. But he was the only one to turn up. He has always depicted the end of the Band as a surprise \u2013 but this seems at odds with the concept of a supremely elaborate farewell concert. \u201cOur plan was we were going to put the road aside, to take a break. And then, as I said in the film, when I realised everybody forgot to come back, I had to read the writing on the wall,\u201d he says. That word \u201cforgot\u201d feels like a bit of a narrative liberty. After all, the other members of the Band reunited in 1983. Even after Manuel died in 1986, Hudson, Helm and Danko carried on \u2013 without Robertson. So didn\u2019t he leave them? \u201cThey got in touch and said, \u2018We want to go out and do some playing, and is it OK that we use the name the Band?\u2019 Because they didn\u2019t have a creative outlet like me.\u201d By then Robertson was writing music for film. \u201cI said, \u2018Guys, go ahead. If you want to go in and make a beautiful record, I\u2019m first in line. But I\u2019m not going back on the road with you.\u2019 I knew what was going on with Richard, Rick and Levon, still. And I had this fear inside. It could be dark. And it could be dangerous. And as it turned out, it was.\u201d I can\u2019t help wondering whether memoir is a way to self-soothe, to sort through the difficult circumstances that led to the Band\u2019s demise, the pain of the distance from Helm in particular towards the end of his life. But Robertson sounds perplexed by the question. He says he is only celebrating their amazing journey. The other living member of the brotherhood is Hudson, who is 82 and lives in Woodstock. Archive audio of his voice features in this documentary, but no new interview. \u201cGarth is a recluse and he doesn\u2019t talk,\u201d Robertson says. \u201cHe has a health issue. I don\u2019t think it would be respectful to Garth to show that he is not feeling that well, and to not be able to show him in a shining light.\u201d So it falls to Robertson to tell the Band\u2019s story and, by telling it, to own it. Does this inequality with his brothers trouble him, especially since at its heart the Band was a celebration of the collective? \u201cInequality to the other guys?\u201d he asks, sounding puzzled. \u201cLike I said, early on they just kind of pushed me out there and said, \u2018Tell them what we\u2019re trying to say.\u2019 And because I was the creative writer in this group, and I also have the ability to \u2026 whatever you call it ... lead the charge, everybody enjoyed that I would take that responsibility. That I would do the dirty work in that way. So it fell on me. It fell on me and I respect it and I try to tell the most honest version of the story I can.\u201d It\u2019s a fair point, yet for a memoirist, he seems pretty averse to reflection. \u201cI\u2019m not going to get moopy or soppy or mushy,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just not the cloth I\u2019m cut from.\u201d \u2022 Robbie Robertson\u2019s album Sinematic is out now. Once Were Brothers premiered at the Toronto film festival in September. \u2022 This article was amended on 29 October 2019. An earlier version said the Hawks backed Dylan \u201cwhen he first went electric\u201d. To clarify, Dylan\u2019s first electric appearance, at the Newport folk festival in 1965, was with members of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band.",

Or, more precisely, of the thousands of shrill, bright green monk parakeets that screech through the capital\u2019s skies and build vast nests in its trees. The council has announced plans to reduce the number of parakeets after a recent survey showed the population had grown from 9,000 birds three years ago to 12,000 today. In 2005, there were only 1,700 of them in Madrid. Although the birds are native to Argentina, many were imported as pets before ownership was outlawed eight years ago. The city council says the swelling population needs to be brought down as the parakeets are competing with other species for food and damaging the environment by stripping vegetation to build their huge stick nests. It also says they pose a public health risk as they can pass illnesses such as psittacosis (parrot fever), avian flu and salmonella on to humans. And then there is the size of their nests. \u201cAs time goes on and they get bigger, these nests can become dangerous and weigh up to 200kg,\u201d the council said in a statement. \u201cThat represents a threat to the branches that support them and also to the people on whom they could fall.\u201d The city authorities are working with the Spanish Ornithological Society, SEO Birdlife, and will begin \u201chumane slaughter\u201d and egg sterilisation over the coming months. \u201cWe\u2019re going to put into effect a plan to control and reduce the number of monk parakeets in the city of Madrid as they have become a worry for people and we\u2019ve had a lot of complaints,\u201d said Borja Carabante, the council\u2019s environmental representative.

On October 8 1920, the Manchester Guardian reported the previous day\u2019s ceremony at Oxford University: \u201cThe ceremony, which was performed by the Vice Chancellor, Dr. Farnell, Rector of Exeter College, took place in the ancient Divinity School. About 110 women undergraduates attended. They wore academic dress, consisting of soft square black caps of the shape worn by the members of the University in the sixteenth century, with gowns, like those worn by the men, over dark coats and skirts.\u201d Oxford opens its doors to women, October 1920 It is unclear who the first woman to graduate from the university was, given the lengthy process to actually admit them. However, the first to gain honours in an examination which was intended to be the equivalent to that of a man for a degree was Annie Mary Anne Henley Rogers, who was retrospectively awarded a degree in 1920 for exams that she had passed forty-three years earlier in 1877. Despite this, a quota limiting the number of female students to a quarter of men was not removed until 1957, and from the 1970s all-male colleges also moved towards admitting women: The decision by Oxford University to admit women led to a similar discussion at Cambridge in 1920. The members of the Senate House, however, voted against the right and it was not until 1947 that the university introduced new legislation, allowing women to graduate the following year.

The typhoon had initially been expected to cause disruption to Ireland\u2019s key Pool A match with Russia in Fukuoka but now appears headed for the capital.

      "bodyText": "England will not take a risk with Billy Vunipola against France after the No 8 sustained a twisted ankle last weekend, but they remain hopeful he will play a further part in their World Cup campaign. Vunipola has undergone a scan on his left ankle and was seen in a protective boot at the team hotel, despite claims from the England coaching staff on Monday that he did not require one. England are still not publicly ruling him out of appearing in his 13th consecutive Test of the year, against France in Yokohama on Saturday, but with qualification for the quarter\u2011finals already assured it is almost certain he will be omitted. Mark Wilson, who was absent from the matchday 23, is standing by. Vunipola was not able to take part in the training session on Tuesday morning and, while England are keeping details to a minimum, they have opted against sending the 26-year-old player home and summoning a replacement, suggesting a decision will be made on his availability for the knockout stages next week. \u201cWe are being overly cautious and if there is any risk that Billy is not going to be 100% we will rest him,\u201d England\u2019s attack coach, Scott Wisemantel, said. Doubts have emerged, however, over whether the match on Saturday will go ahead with Super Typhoon Hagibis changing course and heading for Tokyo and Yokohama over the weekend. The typhoon had initially been expected to cause disruption to Ireland\u2019s key Pool A match with Russia in Fukuoka but now appears headed for the capital. Yokohama, where Japan face Scotland on Sunday, is also under threat for what the Japanese meteorological agency has described as the most explosive typhoon of the year.

The US president, Donald Trump, has repeatedly castigated allies for refusing to repatriate their citizens, even threatening to dump Isis prisoners at the borders of Europe.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/07/us-withdrawal-from-syria-leaves-fate-of-isis-fighters-and-families-in-detention-uncertain\">Trump's shock Syria retreat reverberates as Turkish troops mass</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Australian defence minister, Linda Reynolds, said on Tuesday the Australian government was in \u201cclose contact\u201d with its allies, including the US, after the shock announcement from Trump that America would be withdrawing its troops from the region as well as support for Kurdish allies, effectively green-lighting a Turkish invasion of northern Syria.</p> <p>\u201cIt is too early yet to speculate on the consequences this might have for Australian policy in the region, as it is a very rapidly evolving new situation,\u201d Reynolds said. \u201cWe will continue to monitor and act accordingly when we have more information to hand.\u201d</p> <p>She said the Australian government was \u201cvery concerned\u201d about the plight of Australians held in the region.</p> <p>\u201cBut I would emphasise that consular support in the area is limited if not non-existent. Any consideration of action by the Australian government will have to take into consideration the lives of anyone else we might send into the region. We will not jeopardise the lives of any other Australians.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a very difficult situation. It is a very dangerous area, we will not be endangering the lives of other Australians. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d</p> <p>However, Dabboussy, whose daughter Mariam and three grandchildren are being held in Al Hawl camp in northern Syria, said a repatriation mission of Australian women and children was possible, particularly now while US troops remained.</p> <p>\u201cI think they can do it, to say that it is dangerous, you have to remember I made it in there safely, other Australians have been there, and I believe the Americans have offered support for countries repatriating their nationals,\u201d he told the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cI do believe it can be done, it\u2019s the will to do it that is lacking.\u201d</p> <p>Dabboussy said the future of the region was uncertain, but that the current security arrangements were holding in the wake of the Trump announcement. \u201cIt is safer today that it will be tomorrow.\u201d There are 20 Australian women held in Al-Hawl, and 44 children, most aged under five.</p> <p>Reports from the region say Turkish forces have begun massing on the border. The Turkish president has previously outlined a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/24/erdogan-proposes-plan-for-refugee-safe-zone-in-syria\">plan for a military incursion 32km into Syria, creating a \u201csafe zone\u201d</a> for Syrians displaced by war to resettle.</p> <p>News of the US withdrawal has been met with confusion, fear and panic by Australians in Al-Hawl, which falls outside the parameters of the proposed safe zone, and so may not be directly affected by a Turkish military incursion.</p> <p>\u201cThey are by themselves and they desperately need the help of the Australian government for their survival,\u201d Dabboussy said.</p> <p>Beyond the risk of disease and lack of medical care, Dabboussy said there were extremists inside the camp and \u201csleeper cells\u201d beyond its fences, putting his family and others at risk of death.</p> <p>\u201cWe have been saying for some time that if the Australians are left there much longer, there will be an Australian death \u2013 and I firmly believe that is the case,\u201d Dabboussy said.</p> <p>His daughter Mariam and other women had been duped and coerced into travelling to Syria and did not pose a threat to Australia, Dabboussy said. </p> <p>Australia has previously run repatriation missions for children. In June, the government repatriated eight children of two slain Isis fighters who were Australian citizens.</p> <p>Earlier this year, a US embassy spokesman urged Australia to take its foreign fighters and their families back.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/07/trump-syria-us-troop-withdrawal-turkey\">Trump left isolated as Republican allies revolt over US withdrawal from Syria</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cRepatriating foreign terrorist fighters to their countries of origin is the best solution to prevent them from returning to the battlefield,\u201d the spokesman said.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), Amjed Osman, said on Monday it was not clear what would happen to the prisoners and foreign nationals in displacement camps. \u201cWe repeatedly called for foreign states to take responsibility for their Isis nationals.

Running the prisons and camps has stretched the SDF to its limits and prompted warnings that militants are using the prisons to regroup.</p> <p>Some 74,000 women and children of the caliphate are held at the Al-Hawl camp, where they are guarded by just 400 SDF soldiers.

      "bodyText": "The Australian government has no immediate plan to rescue its citizens \u2013 including 20 women and more than 40 children \u2013 stranded in dangerous and squalid camps in northern Syria, arguing it will not risk more Australian lives trying to get them out. But as Turkish troops mass on the border ahead of an expected invasion, a Sydney grandfather whose daughter and grandchildren are trapped in Al-Hawl camp argues Syria is \u201csafer today than it will be tomorrow\u201d. Kamalle Dabboussy said he had safely visited the camps recently, and urged Australia to repatriate its citizens while US troops are still providing a measure of security in the region. The US government has consistently urged foreign governments to \u201ctake responsibility\u201d for their nationals held in Kurdish-controlled internally displaced persons camps and prisons in Syria. The US president, Donald Trump, has repeatedly castigated allies for refusing to repatriate their citizens, even threatening to dump Isis prisoners at the borders of Europe. The Australian defence minister, Linda Reynolds, said on Tuesday the Australian government was in \u201cclose contact\u201d with its allies, including the US, after the shock announcement from Trump that America would be withdrawing its troops from the region as well as support for Kurdish allies, effectively green-lighting a Turkish invasion of northern Syria. \u201cIt is too early yet to speculate on the consequences this might have for Australian policy in the region, as it is a very rapidly evolving new situation,\u201d Reynolds said. \u201cWe will continue to monitor and act accordingly when we have more information to hand.\u201d She said the Australian government was \u201cvery concerned\u201d about the plight of Australians held in the region. \u201cBut I would emphasise that consular support in the area is limited if not non-existent. Any consideration of action by the Australian government will have to take into consideration the lives of anyone else we might send into the region. We will not jeopardise the lives of any other Australians. \u201cIt is a very difficult situation. It is a very dangerous area, we will not be endangering the lives of other Australians. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d However, Dabboussy, whose daughter Mariam and three grandchildren are being held in Al Hawl camp in northern Syria, said a repatriation mission of Australian women and children was possible, particularly now while US troops remained. \u201cI think they can do it, to say that it is dangerous, you have to remember I made it in there safely, other Australians have been there, and I believe the Americans have offered support for countries repatriating their nationals,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cI do believe it can be done, it\u2019s the will to do it that is lacking.\u201d Dabboussy said the future of the region was uncertain, but that the current security arrangements were holding in the wake of the Trump announcement. \u201cIt is safer today that it will be tomorrow.\u201d There are 20 Australian women held in Al-Hawl, and 44 children, most aged under five. Reports from the region say Turkish forces have begun massing on the border. The Turkish president has previously outlined a plan for a military incursion 32km into Syria, creating a \u201csafe zone\u201d for Syrians displaced by war to resettle. News of the US withdrawal has been met with confusion, fear and panic by Australians in Al-Hawl, which falls outside the parameters of the proposed safe zone, and so may not be directly affected by a Turkish military incursion. \u201cThey are by themselves and they desperately need the help of the Australian government for their survival,\u201d Dabboussy said. Beyond the risk of disease and lack of medical care, Dabboussy said there were extremists inside the camp and \u201csleeper cells\u201d beyond its fences, putting his family and others at risk of death. \u201cWe have been saying for some time that if the Australians are left there much longer, there will be an Australian death \u2013 and I firmly believe that is the case,\u201d Dabboussy said. His daughter Mariam and other women had been duped and coerced into travelling to Syria and did not pose a threat to Australia, Dabboussy said. Australia has previously run repatriation missions for children. In June, the government repatriated eight children of two slain Isis fighters who were Australian citizens. Earlier this year, a US embassy spokesman urged Australia to take its foreign fighters and their families back. \u201cRepatriating foreign terrorist fighters to their countries of origin is the best solution to prevent them from returning to the battlefield,\u201d the spokesman said. A spokesman for the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), Amjed Osman, said on Monday it was not clear what would happen to the prisoners and foreign nationals in displacement camps. \u201cWe repeatedly called for foreign states to take responsibility for their Isis nationals. But there was no response,\u201d he said in a statement. It is unclear if Turkey wants to \u2013 or has capacity to \u2013 take custody of the detainees being held in Kurdish jails and displacement camps. Running the prisons and camps has stretched the SDF to its limits and prompted warnings that militants are using the prisons to regroup. Some 74,000 women and children of the caliphate are held at the Al-Hawl camp, where they are guarded by just 400 SDF soldiers. The camp is regarded as a hotbed of violence and extremist ideology, and has seen recent outbreaks of militant violence. Australian Associated Press contributed to this report",

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.<br></p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Calle and Romero are Spanish passport-holders who have worked in the UK since 2012 and 2013 respectively.

All three, who are members of the Independent Workers\u2019 Union of Great Britain (IWGB) and are cleaners or bicycle couriers, are planning to join the civil rights organisation Liberty in a combined effort to ensure the prime minister does not breach the Benn act. Their action in the English courts is designed to complement a similar claim brought by Scottish campaigners aimed at forcing Johnson to ask for an extension to the UK\u2019s membership of the EU if no agreement is reached by 19 October. The barrister Jolyon Maugham QC and other activists lost their attempt in Edinburgh for a court order requiring compliance on Monday but will appeal. The European Union (Withdrawal) Act (No2) 2019, known as the Benn act, mandates the prime minister to write to the EU seeking an extension to article 50 until 31 January in the absence of a deal. In a letter sent to Downing Street last week, lawyers for Maritza Calle, Wilson Romero, Alexander Marshall and the IWGB said failure to comply with the Benn act \u201cwould be self-evidently unlawful\u201d. Calle and Romero are Spanish passport-holders who have worked in the UK since 2012 and 2013 respectively. Both have UK residency rights through EU citizenship. Marshall is a UK national who works as a bicycle courier and is involved in a European court of justice case on holiday rights. Marshall, the chair of the IWGB\u2019s couriers and logistics branch, said: \u201cWithout the EU charter of fundamental rights and the European court it would have been impossible for my colleagues and I to bring the landmark \u00a31m holiday pay claim against our employer, The Doctors Laboratory. \u201cCrashing out with a no-deal Brexit could put the case at risk and couriers like myself would never see the thousands of pounds they are owed by the company.

Johnson\u2019s formal undertaking through government lawyers in the Scottish courts last week promising to seek an extension came despite contradictory comments made outside court in which he has repeatedly implied that the UK will leave on 31 October with or without a deal.

The rule of law is crucial for low-paid workers.\u201d Liberty, which has been raising money through the CrowdJustice fundraising website for its claim, said it was launching the action not because it was a Brexit issue but because it opposed the prime minister\u2019s threats to break the law. \u201cBoris Johnson has said he will ignore this act of parliament,\u201d Liberty said. \u201cThis will set an extraordinarily dangerous precedent. This is not a Brexit issue. No one is above the law \u2013 and if the prime minister breaks it, we\u2019ll see him in court. \u201cThere is much confusion about whether the government will comply with its obligations under the Benn act,\u201d it said. \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s lawyers have told us it will obey the law, but Boris Johnson himself has contradicted that claim.\u201d No date has yet been set for any court hearing. Meanwhile the Shrewsbury Conservative MP and keen Brexiter Daniel Kawczynski is understood to be considering rival legal action to challenge the validity of the Benn act in the courts. As the legal prospects became more complicated, one academic, Dr Robert Basedow at the London School of Economics\u2019 European Institute, has suggested that the European court of justice in Luxembourg could even become involved in adjudicating whether the UK had actually left the EU legally under article 50 after 31 October.",

It is alleged the Volvo driver went 400 yards down the wrong side of the road after pulling out of the airbase. The Sacoolas family had only been in the UK for three weeks.</p> \n<p>Dunn sustained multiple injuries and was taken to John Radcliffe hospital in Oxford, where he died a short time later.</p> \n<p>Police said the suspect \u201cengaged fully\u201d with them at the time and confirmed \u201cthat she had no plans to leave the country in the near future\u201d.</p> \n<p>Northamptonshire police disclosed only on Saturday that Sacoolas had left the UK despite previously telling officers she intended to remain in the UK. Causing death by careless driving can lead to a custodial offence.</p> \n<p>The Croughton airbase acts as a joint intelligence analysis centre. In early 1994 the US and UK governments struck a deal that all those working in RAF Croughton including their families would have diplomatic protection. That deal probably gave Sacoolas the cover to claim immunity.</p> \n<p>Pressed on the controversy on Monday, Johnson said: \u201cI do not think it can be right to use the process of diplomatic immunity for this type of purpose.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"273f04fd-920a-4a0b-a055-93c657ab80a5\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sYDiBu4Uvgw?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Speaking to reporters during a visit to a hospital in Watford, he added: \u201cI think everybody\u2019s sympathies are very much with the family of Harry Dunn and our condolences to them for their tragic loss.\u201d</p> \n<p>The prime minister added that he hoped Sacoolas would come back and \u201cengage properly with the processes of law as they are carried out in this country.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a point that we\u2019ve raised or are raising today with the American ambassador here in the UK and I hope it will be resolved very shortly.\u201d</p> \n<p>The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said discussions about the case had already been held between Raab and the US ambassador, Woody Johnson, and the details were \u201cextremely concerning\u201d.</p> \n<p>Dunn\u2019s parents said they were prepared to travel to Washington to meet Donald Trump about waiving Sacoolas\u2019s diplomatic immunity.</p> \n<p>Dunn\u2019s mother, Charlotte Charles, said if the diplomatic waiver was declined then funds raised by friends and family would be used to travel to try to see the president. Charles said it was a \u201cdishonourable thing to do\u201d for Sacoolas to leave the UK while she remained a suspect.</p> \n<p>She told CBS: \u201cShe killed our boy. If it wasn\u2019t for her being under this suppose diplomatic immunity, it would have been a clear cut case we\u2019d have had justice by now.\u201d</p> \n<p>Charles also said she wanted to speak to Sacoolas \u201cas a mum\u201d, telling the Daily Mail: \u201cAll we need to do is ask her to come back.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson will personally appeal to Donald Trump if the US continues to refuse to lift the diplomatic immunity it has granted to a US diplomat\u2019s wife who is accused of killing a 19-year-old motorcyclist in a traffic collision. Anne Sacoolas, who is married to a US communications official, left the UK last month, prompting widespread anger in Britain over the use of diplomatic immunity to flee potential charges of causing death by dangerous driving. Amid signs that No 10 has been caught off-guard by the level of public outrage, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, raised the case in a telephone call with the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo. A spokesman said Raab \u201creiterated his disappointment\u201d with the US decision not to waive immunity and urged them to reconsider. No 10 said that if Pompeo was not persuaded to take action, then the prime minister would himself raise the issue directly with Trump. Sacoolas left the UK along with her husband Jonathan at the beginning of last month, days after Harry Dunn was killed in a head-on collision with a car that police believe had been driving on the wrong side of the road for 400 yards. In a sign that the US will resist appeals for the return of Sacoolas, the US embassy said the family left the UK on the advice of senior state department officials, adding that diplomatic immunity is rarely waived in such instances. Such cases receive \u201cintense attention at senior levels and are considered carefully given the global impact such decisions carry\u201d, the US Department of State said. The US embassy has expressed its profound sadness at the death, but has refused to comment on how London and Washington interacted when the US first ruled that the Sacoolas family were entitled to claim diplomatic immunity to leave the UK, and so stymie further UK police inquiries. The Foreign Office, probably sensing the grounds for protest were limited by international law, made no public objection to Sacoolas\u2019s departure and only began to make its concerns public when the family of Dunn demanded answers in the media. The episode raises fresh questions about whether diplomatic immunity is routinely abused to provide improper blanket protection for diplomats and their families, so they can evade justice in cases where they have committed illegal acts that have no connection with their professional life. Chris Daw QC, a barrister, said: \u201cIf the US government allows diplomatic immunity (for a spouse, not even a diplomat) to frustrate a serious British criminal investigation, they are no better than the Russians over Salisbury.\u201d Dunn died after a collision with a Volvo XC90 near RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire on 27 August. It is alleged the Volvo driver went 400 yards down the wrong side of the road after pulling out of the airbase. The Sacoolas family had only been in the UK for three weeks. Dunn sustained multiple injuries and was taken to John Radcliffe hospital in Oxford, where he died a short time later. Police said the suspect \u201cengaged fully\u201d with them at the time and confirmed \u201cthat she had no plans to leave the country in the near future\u201d. Northamptonshire police disclosed only on Saturday that Sacoolas had left the UK despite previously telling officers she intended to remain in the UK. Causing death by careless driving can lead to a custodial offence. The Croughton airbase acts as a joint intelligence analysis centre. In early 1994 the US and UK governments struck a deal that all those working in RAF Croughton including their families would have diplomatic protection. That deal probably gave Sacoolas the cover to claim immunity. Pressed on the controversy on Monday, Johnson said: \u201cI do not think it can be right to use the process of diplomatic immunity for this type of purpose.\u201d Speaking to reporters during a visit to a hospital in Watford, he added: \u201cI think everybody\u2019s sympathies are very much with the family of Harry Dunn and our condolences to them for their tragic loss.\u201d The prime minister added that he hoped Sacoolas would come back and \u201cengage properly with the processes of law as they are carried out in this country. \u201cThat\u2019s a point that we\u2019ve raised or are raising today with the American ambassador here in the UK and I hope it will be resolved very shortly.\u201d The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said discussions about the case had already been held between Raab and the US ambassador, Woody Johnson, and the details were \u201cextremely concerning\u201d. Dunn\u2019s parents said they were prepared to travel to Washington to meet Donald Trump about waiving Sacoolas\u2019s diplomatic immunity. Dunn\u2019s mother, Charlotte Charles, said if the diplomatic waiver was declined then funds raised by friends and family would be used to travel to try to see the president. Charles said it was a \u201cdishonourable thing to do\u201d for Sacoolas to leave the UK while she remained a suspect. She told CBS: \u201cShe killed our boy. If it wasn\u2019t for her being under this suppose diplomatic immunity, it would have been a clear cut case we\u2019d have had justice by now.\u201d Charles also said she wanted to speak to Sacoolas \u201cas a mum\u201d, telling the Daily Mail: \u201cAll we need to do is ask her to come back. It\u2019s not much to ask. She\u2019s left a family in complete ruin. We\u2019re broken.\u201d Andrea Leadsom, the business secretary and the MP for South Northamptonshire, tweeted in response to Charles\u2019s comments : \u201cI met Harry\u2019s family yesterday. They are totally heartbroken. We have to get proper justice for Harry and closure for his family.\u201d Nick Adderley, the chief constable of Northamptonshire police, said US authorities had been appealed to in \u201cthe strongest terms\u201d to apply a waiver and \u201callow the justice process to take place\u201d. Adderley confirmed he and Stephen Mold, the police, fire and crime commissioner for Northamptonshire, had contacted the embassy asking for immunity to be waived. Mold told the Times the US decision not to waive immunity was \u201ca breaking of trust, almost a betrayal\u201d of the special relationship. Dunn\u2019s father, Tim Dunn, said the family wanted to get to the truth in order to move forward. He added: \u201cWe can\u2019t grieve for him at the minute, we are unaware where we are going.\u201d Charles said they learned that Sacoolas had left the UK after their son\u2019s funeral. She said her son \u201cwas part of the gel that put us together. Now we are just broken inside and out. Everything hurts every day. We know we can\u2019t bring him back but we need to do so.\u201d",

There is no publication date for their review of options, let alone work to design such a scheme \u2013 and no funding commitment.\u201d Meanwhile, universities are anxious that if the tap is suddenly turned off on existing Horizon 2020 grants there is no clarity about how they secure substitute funding to pay research salaries. \u201cWe are really quite frustrated that we are still waiting for details of how the underwrite will work. The Cabinet Office needs to get on with it,\u201d Stern says. However, asked to comment, a spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said the government had provided a funding guarantee that would cover existing successful Horizon 2020 bids.",

He and I work at different organisations, and our skills and responsibilities, though similar, are not precisely the same. Nevertheless, when this man, who is the same age as me and who went to the same university, revealed that he earns twice as much as I do, I was shocked by how I felt. Outwardly, I made a joke of my indignation, demanding that he pay the bill. But inwardly, something inside me faltered: my confidence. Was it possible that this journalist, a man I admire deeply, would now think less of me, knowing that, on paper, I\u2019m worth only half what he is? More to the point, did I now think less of myself? I worried that the answer to both these questions was yes.</p> <p>We tell ourselves that money doesn\u2019t matter. The nature of the work that I do is, and always has been, more important to me than the fatness of my pay slip (and, yes, I know I\u2019m lucky to be able to make this choice). But equality matters too: it is, in fact, everything. In 2017, when the BBC was forced to reveal the salaries of employees who earned more than \u00a3150,000, Carrie Gracie, its China editor, discovered that, while her own name was not on this select list, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jul/29/jon-sopel-bbc-trump-gener-pay-gap-interview\" title=\"\">Jon Sopel</a>, the BBC\u2019s North American editor, was paid between \u00a3230,000 and \u00a3239,000. How did this news make her feel? Naturally, she was angry. Not only had the BBC begged her to take up her job, insisting she was the only suitable candidate; she had made pay equality a condition of her acceptance, which meant she had been lied to. But she experienced other feelings, too: a faltering. This was a degradation of her abilities, her experience and her dedication.</p> <p>Gracie\u2019s book about her ultimately successful battle to win pay equality at the BBC isn\u2019t always an entirely gripping read. As she acknowledges, long accounts of grievance hearings, all circumspection and tedious HR-speak are likely to make anyone\u2019s eyes glaze over. Moreover, the fact that she still works for the BBC \u2013 having resigned her position as China editor, she is now once again a news presenter \u2013 means that she is careful when it comes to venting her feelings about those (mostly men) who so casually belittled her, in ways both big and small. But still, her book is important, and not only for the sound advice it offers to those who may be going through something similar (it is a manual as much as a memoir).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/sep/02/carrie-gracie-i-learned-about-equal-pay-the-hard-way\">Carrie Gracie: \u2018I learned about equal pay the hard way\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Gracie understands all the various ways in which pay inequality can play havoc with a person\u2019s self-belief and peace of mind, and in her book she staples them to the page. It isn\u2019t only that, as a skirmish turns first into a prolonged battle and then into something approaching a war, she is frightened and frequently weary; that she hardly knows who among her bosses, if any, she can trust. For me, the most resonant parts of her book have to do with her self worth. \u201cCarrie, it\u2019s always such a joy to see you,\u201d says James Harding, the then director of news at the BBC, when she sees him for a meeting in 2015. \u201cYou deliver so much and ask so little.\u201d At the time, she received these words almost gratefully, as women are apt to do. (If people cannot recognise our talent, at least let them salute our efficiency!) Cut to a couple of years later, however, and the BBC is talking of her \u201cgrowth and development\u201d as if she were some graduate at the beginning of her career, not a woman in her 50s who speaks fluent Mandarin and who knows China inside out.</p> <p>Having to assert the value of her work gets her down.

Some of them, in fact, may be quite determined <em>not</em> to acknowledge it, or even to notice it at all. This is a wilful blindness, and though the law is on our side, there is still, alas, every chance it is reflected in our pay packets (there are ways round the law). My own advice, having read Gracie\u2019s book and having fought some battles of my own, is this: be grateful, but not too grateful. Don\u2019t measure yourself against others, but don\u2019t stop looking around you either.

HSBC, which manages the card, recently updated its online security resulting in me being unable to access my account ever since. Despite being on the phone with customer services on two occasions for two hours and 45 minutes, they are unable to rectify the problem. Today, I called for a third time. Judging by complaints on Trustpilot, I am not alone. PS, London John Lewis says that this was not a repeat of the IT problems its card holders suffered back in 2016.

However, school funding has dropped 8% overall since the coalition government came to power in 2010, so in four years\u2019 time we will be back where we were 13 years before.</p> <p>Rather like the much-vaunted parallel promise to provide <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-49123319\" title=\"\">20,000 new police officers</a> to replace 20,000 old police officers cut during the austerity years, this is not investment. Investment is putting money in to get a return of some sort. This is plugging a painful gap.</p> <p>Much has happened since 2010. Cuts have been made and consequences felt. There are 700,000 more pupils in the system and teacher applications are slowing down. For many schools, making efficiencies and staying solvent has meant cutting subjects, enrichment activities and teachers while increasing class sizes at a time of radical change to the curriculum and exams.</p> <p>They also feel the 40% cut in capital funding, shrinking sixth form budgets, the increase in poverty and the decimation of essential local authority services needed to help the most vulnerable students flourish and stay safe. None of this can be wished away.</p> <p>And schools need money now, not in four years\u2019 time. Five of the unions living and working closer to the real world than the prime minister will ever be have stated that, in spite of the extra funding promised, more than 80% of schools will have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/sep/30/funding-80-percent-schools-england-worse-next-year\" title=\"\">less money per pupil in real terms</a> in 2020 than in 2015.

But what does that mean? Levelling up to 2010? Levelling up to the gold-plated Eton education he experienced, or to the comfortable standard his own children enjoyed in private London day schools? This would cost at least an extra \u00a315,000 per pupil per year, so unlikely.</p> <p>Even the promise of closing the gap between the best and worst-funded local authorities seems unattainable. The new minimum funding guarantee of \u00a35,000 for each secondary pupil, and \u00a34,000 for each primary pupil, will leave glaring differences between different parts of the country and even between pupils with similar needs in the same area. And all this without knowing the consequences of Brexit on the economy and public expenditure.</p> <p>It is an interesting thought experiment to speculate on where we might be now if school budgets had continued to rise at the 5% a year that typified the genuine investment of the last Labour government. Then compare that with the next few years. The truth is that this Tory promise isn\u2019t investment and it won\u2019t \u201clevel up\u201d in any meaningful way. The champagne will stay on ice.</p>",

Rather like the much-vaunted parallel promise to provide 20,000 new police officers to replace 20,000 old police officers cut during the austerity years, this is not investment. Investment is putting money in to get a return of some sort. This is plugging a painful gap. Much has happened since 2010. Cuts have been made and consequences felt. There are 700,000 more pupils in the system and teacher applications are slowing down. For many schools, making efficiencies and staying solvent has meant cutting subjects, enrichment activities and teachers while increasing class sizes at a time of radical change to the curriculum and exams. They also feel the 40% cut in capital funding, shrinking sixth form budgets, the increase in poverty and the decimation of essential local authority services needed to help the most vulnerable students flourish and stay safe. None of this can be wished away. And schools need money now, not in four years\u2019 time. Five of the unions living and working closer to the real world than the prime minister will ever be have stated that, in spite of the extra funding promised, more than 80% of schools will have less money per pupil in real terms in 2020 than in 2015. The most deprived pupils will be the hardest hit at a time when progress in narrowing gaps is slowing. Boris Johnson, whom I suspect has very little real understanding of state schools, likes to colour his government\u2019s funding pledge with the vacuous promise that the money will be used to \u201clevel up\u201d. But what does that mean? Levelling up to 2010? Levelling up to the gold-plated Eton education he experienced, or to the comfortable standard his own children enjoyed in private London day schools? This would cost at least an extra \u00a315,000 per pupil per year, so unlikely. Even the promise of closing the gap between the best and worst-funded local authorities seems unattainable. The new minimum funding guarantee of \u00a35,000 for each secondary pupil, and \u00a34,000 for each primary pupil, will leave glaring differences between different parts of the country and even between pupils with similar needs in the same area. And all this without knowing the consequences of Brexit on the economy and public expenditure. It is an interesting thought experiment to speculate on where we might be now if school budgets had continued to rise at the 5% a year that typified the genuine investment of the last Labour government. Then compare that with the next few years. The truth is that this Tory promise isn\u2019t investment and it won\u2019t \u201clevel up\u201d in any meaningful way. The champagne will stay on ice.",

I always tell people if you want a really amazing relationship, be with someone who is your best friend.\u201d As a white woman and a mixed-race man, they had to deal with some bigoted comments. Although Joe has experienced racism all his life, this was a shock for Dee. \u201cWe had people saying a few rude things to us when we got together, which never happened when we were friends.\u201d Despite some difficult times, the pair have only grown closer over the years. \u201cI love that Dee is such a \u2018doer\u2019,\u201d says Joe. \u201cAny suggestion she makes I know it will be great. We\u2019ve been on a brilliant journey together.\u201d The couple got married in 1995 and adopted a daughter seven years later. \u201cBetween us we\u2019ve got seven children, 13 grandchildren and two dogs, so we\u2019re always busy,\u201d says Dee. The pair are now in their 70s, but have no desire to slow down. They love travelling, spending time with their family and having new adventures. \u201cI love how Joe is so easy-going and always goes along with whatever I suggest,\u201d Dee says. Thirty-two years since they got together, the romance is as strong as ever. \u201cIt always feels new and exciting to me, and I feel happy when I know I\u2019m going to see him,\u201d says Dee. \u201cAnd I always feel happy to see the dogs,\u201d laughs Joe. \u201cNo, I\u2019m just kidding. I always look forward to seeing Dee. We have amazing lives.\u201d Want to share your story? Tell us a little about you, your partner and how you got together by filling in the form here.",

together through the lunchtime drizzle to the gleaming high-rise housing the headquarters of <a href=\"https://www.denka.co.jp/eng/corporate/\">Denka</a> in central Tokyo, clinging to the hope that on this, their second trip to the Japanese capital in three months, they would be given the chance to make their case to the people best placed to end their town\u2019s misery.</p> <p>Less than a week earlier, Gerard, 65, and Taylor, 79, had left Reserve, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/louisiana\">Louisiana</a>, with a single aim: to present evidence to Denka, a Japanese chemicals company, that its plant\u2019s toxic emissions are responsible for unusually high rates of cancer and a litany of other diseases in their hometown.</p> <p>Instead, during an unannounced visit to Denka\u2019s headquarters, they came up against a wall of silence during an attempt to meet the firm\u2019s representatives.</p> <p>Surrounded by security guards before they could enter the company\u2019s premises, Gerard and Taylor were told that no one from Denka was prepared to talk to them or accept a copy of a <a href=\"https://www.humanrightsnetwork.org/waiting-to-die\">University Network for Human Rights </a><a href=\"https://www.humanrightsnetwork.org/waiting-to-die\">(UNHR</a><a href=\"https://www.humanrightsnetwork.org/waiting-to-die\">) study</a> published in July that found that residents near the plant, operated by Denka\u2019s US subsidiary, have contracted cancer at unusually high rates.

The Japanese government, however, does not class chloroprene as a dangerous chemical, and no public records are kept on chloroprene emissions in Omi, on the Japan Sea coast, where Denka runs the only plant in the country that manufactures the chemical, but via a different process than the one used at its plant in Reserve.</p> <p>When the group travelled east of Tokyo to Chiba prefecture, home to a large Denka chemicals plant, staff told them that the facility did not produce chloroprene and politely declined requests for an impromptu guided tour of the facility similar to those offered to local schoolchildren.</p> <p>The Reserve plant, originally built by the US chemicals giant DuPont, went into operation in 1968. The firm sold it to Denka just before the damning EPA report was published in 2015.</p> <p>Speaking to journalists at the Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club of Japan the day before their fruitless visit to the Denka HQ, Gerard, who was born close to the plant and raised a family there, said her husband \u201chad always been healthy, and we believe that [his cancer] was the result of chloroprene from the Denka facility.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want to move. The plant has to bring emissions down, or it has to move. It\u2019s Denka\u2019s responsibility to be good neighbours, but they don\u2019t see the need to bring emissions down. There is no reason why they can\u2019t do what is necessary.\u201d</p> <p>Taylor and Gerard, accompanied by Ruhan Nagra, the executive director of UNHR, found their paths blocked by security guards as soon as they entered the second-floor lobby that houses the Denka headquarters.</p> <p>The confrontation, witnessed by the Guardian, lasted about 25 minutes and ended after a stocky man in dark sunglasses who appeared to be head of security repeatedly asked the three to \u201cleave the building immediately\u201d and refused to accept and pass on the UNHR study.</p> <p>The standoff was a repeat of an unsuccessful attempt Taylor and Gerard had made to enter a Denka shareholders\u2019 meeting during their first visit to Japan in July. </p> <p>\u201cThey won\u2019t talk to us,\u201d said Taylor, whose adult daughter, Raven, is ill with a rare intestinal disease \u2013 gastroparesis \u2013 that he said doctors had tied to chloroprene. \u201cThis is the way they treat us \u2013 like we\u2019re nothing. We get the same from DuPont and Denka even though they\u2019re in my front yard, and from the governor of Louisiana. This strategy is pointless \u2013 they\u2019re never going to allow us in there. We\u2019re seen as the low-hanging fruit because we are the least able to protect ourselves.\u201d</p> <p>At least one security guard followed Taylor, Gerard and Nagra to a subway station on the opposite side of the road.</p> <p>Outside in the drizzle, Gerard reflected on another unsuccessful attempt to engage with the company she blames for the cancer that killed her husband.</p> <p>\u201cThis all goes to show what big business feels about people like us,\u201d she said, sheltering beneath an umbrella. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to hear what we have to say. They all want us to go away and be quiet. But we\u2019re not going to do that.\u201d</p> <p>But she and Taylor voiced hope that their visit would generate more interest in their plight in Japan, where the media have largely ignored the claims made against the company.

      "bodyText": "Lydia Gerard and Robert Taylor never came close to losing their composure, even when it became clear that that their 7,000-mile journey from the southern United States to Japan was about to come to nought. Denied even the courtesy of a brief meeting \u2013 in a country fabled for its levels of civility \u2013 with representatives of a Japanese company they blame for spewing a toxic chemical into the air above their home town, they listened patiently as uniformed guards repeatedly told them to turn around and leave \u2013 immediately. They had walked together through the lunchtime drizzle to the gleaming high-rise housing the headquarters of Denka in central Tokyo, clinging to the hope that on this, their second trip to the Japanese capital in three months, they would be given the chance to make their case to the people best placed to end their town\u2019s misery. Less than a week earlier, Gerard, 65, and Taylor, 79, had left Reserve, Louisiana, with a single aim: to present evidence to Denka, a Japanese chemicals company, that its plant\u2019s toxic emissions are responsible for unusually high rates of cancer and a litany of other diseases in their hometown. Instead, during an unannounced visit to Denka\u2019s headquarters, they came up against a wall of silence during an attempt to meet the firm\u2019s representatives. Surrounded by security guards before they could enter the company\u2019s premises, Gerard and Taylor were told that no one from Denka was prepared to talk to them or accept a copy of a University Network for Human Rights (UNHR) study published in July that found that residents near the plant, operated by Denka\u2019s US subsidiary, have contracted cancer at unusually high rates. One census tract next to the plant has the highest cancer risk anywhere in America due to airborne toxicity, 50 times above the national average, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). After repeatedly being told to leave, Gerard broke her silence. \u201cWe live next to the Denka plant in Louisiana, and we have lots of concerns. We want to give them this information,\u201d Gerard, whose husband, Walter, died of cancer last year, said to security guards in front of the building\u2019s second-floor reception area. Walter was diagnosed with the disease two years before the 2015 release of the EPA report. After failing to get a response, Gerard tried again. \u201cCould someone from Denka please come down and receive this,\u201d she said, referring to the health study by the UNHR, a US-based civil society group that organised their trip to Japan. Surrounded by guards and several men in business suits who could not be identified as their lanyard IDs were facing inwards, she added: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to talk to them or receive any information, we just want to hand this to someone from Denka.\u201d The toxic emissions in Reserve, a town in St John the Baptist parish \u2013 a predominantly black, working-class community \u2013 come primarily from the Pontchartrain Works facility, the only place in the US to manufacture the synthetic rubber neoprene. Reserve is the focus of a yearlong Guardian series, Cancer Town, examining the fight for clean air in the town, as well as other communities in the area between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, known colloquially as Cancer Alley. The US government considers chloroprene, the primary constituent of neoprene, as likely to be carcinogenic to humans. The Japanese government, however, does not class chloroprene as a dangerous chemical, and no public records are kept on chloroprene emissions in Omi, on the Japan Sea coast, where Denka runs the only plant in the country that manufactures the chemical, but via a different process than the one used at its plant in Reserve. When the group travelled east of Tokyo to Chiba prefecture, home to a large Denka chemicals plant, staff told them that the facility did not produce chloroprene and politely declined requests for an impromptu guided tour of the facility similar to those offered to local schoolchildren. The Reserve plant, originally built by the US chemicals giant DuPont, went into operation in 1968. The firm sold it to Denka just before the damning EPA report was published in 2015. Speaking to journalists at the Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club of Japan the day before their fruitless visit to the Denka HQ, Gerard, who was born close to the plant and raised a family there, said her husband \u201chad always been healthy, and we believe that [his cancer] was the result of chloroprene from the Denka facility. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to move. The plant has to bring emissions down, or it has to move. It\u2019s Denka\u2019s responsibility to be good neighbours, but they don\u2019t see the need to bring emissions down. There is no reason why they can\u2019t do what is necessary.\u201d Taylor and Gerard, accompanied by Ruhan Nagra, the executive director of UNHR, found their paths blocked by security guards as soon as they entered the second-floor lobby that houses the Denka headquarters. The confrontation, witnessed by the Guardian, lasted about 25 minutes and ended after a stocky man in dark sunglasses who appeared to be head of security repeatedly asked the three to \u201cleave the building immediately\u201d and refused to accept and pass on the UNHR study. The standoff was a repeat of an unsuccessful attempt Taylor and Gerard had made to enter a Denka shareholders\u2019 meeting during their first visit to Japan in July. \u201cThey won\u2019t talk to us,\u201d said Taylor, whose adult daughter, Raven, is ill with a rare intestinal disease \u2013 gastroparesis \u2013 that he said doctors had tied to chloroprene. \u201cThis is the way they treat us \u2013 like we\u2019re nothing. We get the same from DuPont and Denka even though they\u2019re in my front yard, and from the governor of Louisiana. This strategy is pointless \u2013 they\u2019re never going to allow us in there. We\u2019re seen as the low-hanging fruit because we are the least able to protect ourselves.\u201d At least one security guard followed Taylor, Gerard and Nagra to a subway station on the opposite side of the road. Outside in the drizzle, Gerard reflected on another unsuccessful attempt to engage with the company she blames for the cancer that killed her husband. \u201cThis all goes to show what big business feels about people like us,\u201d she said, sheltering beneath an umbrella. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to hear what we have to say. They all want us to go away and be quiet. But we\u2019re not going to do that.\u201d But she and Taylor voiced hope that their visit would generate more interest in their plight in Japan, where the media have largely ignored the claims made against the company. Following their most recent visit, a major daily newspaper and a weekly business magazine have reportedly said they plan to run articles on the issue. UNHR did manage to secure a meeting with the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), which helped finance Denka\u2019s purchase of the DuPont plant. JBIC officials refused to discuss its involvement in the Denka project, however, citing ongoing litigation involving Denka, according to Nagra. At its meeting with Nagra, Taylor and Gerard, the bank would only talk in general terms about the procedures it follows when financing projects, she added. The JBIC classifies the Denka plant as a category C project, meaning that it has determined that the plant \u201cis likely to have minimal or no adverse environmental impact\u201d and requires no environmental review or monitoring. JBIC representatives refused to discuss why the bank had selected that classification when pushed by Nagra. It is not clear if a C classification would prevent Reserve residents from filing a complaint via the JBIC\u2019s in-house grievance process. Minutes after he and Gerard were left with no choice but to leave the Denka building, Taylor struggled to hide his bitterness towards the company \u2013 for its refusal to countenance that it is responsible for dangerously toxic air, and for its apparent disregard for the victims and their families. \u201cWe\u2019re so insignificant to them that they set the dogs on us to prevent us from going in,\u201d he said. \u201cTo talk to us would be to admit that we\u2019re human. It\u2019s like they\u2019re saying, \u2018We can dump anything we want on your community and you have to sit down and let it happen.\u2019\u201d",

The realistic deadline for finding a deal is probably three or four days before the 17 October EU summit. To reach a deal, the UK must satisfy the EU that its plans for checks on goods crossing the border in Ireland will work, will preserve peace, and will protect the single market and the all-Ireland economy. It will also have to shelve the Stormont lock.</p> <p>Johnson may have the DUP and ERG on board, but any further British compromises will see them jump ship. And for the EU fundamental issues, not minor technical issues, are at stake: essentially, whether it is possible to leave the EU customs union and still have most of the frictionless border advantages of being in.</p> <p>Talks will continue: the EU does not want to be seen to be pushing a member out, and Johnson wants to be seen to be doing all he can to secure an agreement, to bolster a future claim that the EU would be to blame for no deal.</p> <p>And no one knows for sure what will happen if no deal has been achieved by 19 October, at which point the Benn act will oblige the PM to seek a three-month Brexit extension. No 10 says Johnson will obey the law, but he has said he will not resign and would rather <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/05/boris-johnson-rather-be-dead-in-ditch-than-agree-brexit-extension\">\u201cbe dead in a ditch\u201d</a> than ask for an extension.</p> <h2>Best of the rest</h2> <ul> <li><p>\u2018It\u2019s like a death sentence\u2019: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/07/like-death-sentence-retired-britons-eu-face-loss-healthcare\">retired Britons in EU face loss of healthcare</a>.</p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/07/court-rejects-latest-request-to-force-pm-to-ask-for-brexit-extension\">Court rejects latest request</a> to force PM to ask for Brexit extension.</p></li> <li><p>Leaked Brexit planning memo offers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/07/leaked-brexit-planning-memo-offers-no-new-guidance-for-departing-eu\">no new guidance for departing EU</a>.</p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/06/corbyn-must-lead-any-interim-government-says-shadow-chancellor\">Corbyn must lead any interim government</a>, says shadow chancellor.</p></li> <li><p>Tory election delayed plans to secure <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/06/conservative-election-impact-on-securing-medical-supplies-before-a-no-deal-brexit\">key medical supplies before Brexit</a>.</p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/05/brexitspeak-brexit-vocabulary-growing-too-fast-public-keep-up\">\u2018Brexitspeak\u2019 growing too fast</a> for public to keep up, say experts.</p></li> <li><p>No-deal Brexit may make <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/03/no-deal-brexit-may-make-touring-europe-simply-unviable-for-uk-artists\">touring Europe \u2018unviable\u2019 for UK artists</a>.</p></li> <li><p>Top Conservative says he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/02/james-cleverly-top-conservative-says-he-fears-riots-if-uk-fails-to-leave-eu\">fears riots if UK fails to leave</a> EU.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Top comment</h2> <p>In the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/05/europeans-in-britain-used-to-feel-at-home-now-they-their-doubts\">Observer, Nick Cohen says</a> promises to protect EU migrants in Britain have been broken too quickly, and that does not augur well for the future:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Were you worried about how we leave the EU without hurting the economy?

We were told ad nauseam that EU rights for workers and environmental protections would stay in place. They would be fine. Now Johnson\u2019s government says destroying them is \u201cvital for giving us the freedom and flexibility to strike new trade deals and become more competitive\u201d. For years, I\u2019ve believed it is worth watching how a state treats foreigners under its control, because you see how it will treat the rest of the population if it has the chance.

Join chair Zoe Williams and our panel of Guardian writers including the chief leader writer, Randeep Ramesh; Lisa O\u2019Carroll, Brexit correspondent; and Rowena Mason, deputy political editor, as they discuss the unfolding Brexit chaos. Top stories After insisting to the Conservative party conference that Britain was ready for a no-deal Brexit, Boris Johnson repeated his pledge that the UK would be leaving the EU on 31 October come what may \u2013 and unveiled his \u201cfinal offer\u201d to the bloc. Dubbed \u201ctwo borders for four years\u201d, the plan to replace the controversial backstop boils down to Northern Ireland leaving the EU\u2019s customs territory with the rest of the UK on Brexit day but staying in the single market for goods, and the Northern Irish assembly getting the right to veto the arrangements every four years. The outline proposal soon won cautious support in Westminster from both the hardline Brexiters of the European Research Group (ERG) and the Democratic Unionist party (DUP), although not from Labour, leading many observers to suggest it might actually be capable of winning a slender Commons majority. But the EU27 reacted with dismay, with the chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, giving a scathing analysis of the PM\u2019s plan, the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, saying it did not meet the \u201cagreed objectives\u201d of the backstop, and the European parliament saying it was \u201cnot remotely acceptable\u201d. As the EU urged Johnson to publish the plan in full, the PM announced plans for a whirlwind tour of European capitals to try to sell it (both the German and French leaders, Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron, said diary issues would unfortunately make this impossible). Meanwhile, the government promised a Scottish court that Johnson would if necessary ask the EU for a Brexit extension as required by the Benn act, apparently contradicting his repeated pledges to leave on 31 October regardless and claims from No 10 that he would find a way to sidestep the act \u2013 prompting fears he was careering towards a fresh constitutional crisis. Ministers floated the idea that the \u201cStormont lock\u201d, requiring the Northern Ireland assembly to approve the arrangements, could be ditched, but Brussels was unconvinced and declined the UK\u2019s request for weekend talks, saying there was as yet no basis on which they could take place. In Paris, Barnier said a deal was now looking \u201cpossible, but very difficult\u201d, adding that no deal would never be the EU\u2019s choice but the UK\u2019s. Macron subsequently gave the PM until the end of this week to fundamentally revise his plan. No 10 sought on Monday to deflect the blame for the impasse on to the EU, saying the bloc was refusing to \u201cengage fully\u201d with London\u2019s proposals. Brussels responded with a stinging rebuff, leaking a point-by-point rebuttal of the UK\u2019s plans which it said had already been handed to the government. What next It\u2019s another critical week. The realistic deadline for finding a deal is probably three or four days before the 17 October EU summit. To reach a deal, the UK must satisfy the EU that its plans for checks on goods crossing the border in Ireland will work, will preserve peace, and will protect the single market and the all-Ireland economy. It will also have to shelve the Stormont lock. Johnson may have the DUP and ERG on board, but any further British compromises will see them jump ship. And for the EU fundamental issues, not minor technical issues, are at stake: essentially, whether it is possible to leave the EU customs union and still have most of the frictionless border advantages of being in. Talks will continue: the EU does not want to be seen to be pushing a member out, and Johnson wants to be seen to be doing all he can to secure an agreement, to bolster a future claim that the EU would be to blame for no deal. And no one knows for sure what will happen if no deal has been achieved by 19 October, at which point the Benn act will oblige the PM to seek a three-month Brexit extension. No 10 says Johnson will obey the law, but he has said he will not resign and would rather \u201cbe dead in a ditch\u201d than ask for an extension. Best of the rest \u2018It\u2019s like a death sentence\u2019: retired Britons in EU face loss of healthcare. Court rejects latest request to force PM to ask for Brexit extension. Leaked Brexit planning memo offers no new guidance for departing EU. Corbyn must lead any interim government, says shadow chancellor. Tory election delayed plans to secure key medical supplies before Brexit. \u2018Brexitspeak\u2019 growing too fast for public to keep up, say experts. No-deal Brexit may make touring Europe \u2018unviable\u2019 for UK artists. Top Conservative says he fears riots if UK fails to leave EU. Top comment In the Observer, Nick Cohen says promises to protect EU migrants in Britain have been broken too quickly, and that does not augur well for the future: Were you worried about how we leave the EU without hurting the economy? You should not have been. Supporters of Brexit swore the task of striking a free trade agreement with the EU should be \u201cone of the easiest in human history\u201d. It would be fine. We were told ad nauseam that EU rights for workers and environmental protections would stay in place. They would be fine. Now Johnson\u2019s government says destroying them is \u201cvital for giving us the freedom and flexibility to strike new trade deals and become more competitive\u201d. For years, I\u2019ve believed it is worth watching how a state treats foreigners under its control, because you see how it will treat the rest of the population if it has the chance. As rights go, horizons narrow and the culture turns rancid, the identity politics that Brexit Britain is forcing on the Europeans who live here is becoming the politics it will force on everyone else.

Much has changed (Netflix\u2019s business, Amazon\u2019s products) but Seinfeld, along with its fellow NBC stalwart Friends, remains broadly popular and inordinately valuable; last month, Netflix paid over $500m for the rights to stream all of Seinfeld\u2019s 180 episodes globally.</p> <p>The sky-high sum for the show about nothing is one of several giant deals in recent months for library rights to legacy shows, representing a new, cash-laden front on the global streaming wars. In July, WarnerMedia outbid Netflix <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/friends-officially-leaving-netflix-warnermedias-streaming-service-1223151\">with $425m</a> for all 10 seasons of Friends, which will stream on its forthcoming service HBO Max in spring 2020. A month earlier, Netflix also lost the rights to The Office, one of its most popular shows, to NBCUniversal, who <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/office-leave-netflix-2020-stream-exclusively-nbcuniversals-forthcoming-service-1220954\">paid $500m</a> to stream the show for five years on its own forthcoming service, Peacock, in 2021. (Netflix will maintain global rights.)

Why are streaming companies willing to pay so much for shows of nostalgic value? And as numerous companies prepare to launch their own streaming services \u2013 HBO Max and Peacock, not to mention the forthcoming Apple TV+ \u2013 why bet on the appeal of legacy TV shows?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9f954f79f44306d18f12e712c9202bac47fd587a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f954f79f44306d18f12e712c9202bac47fd587a/0_0_2988_3000/996.jpg\" alt=\"The cast of Friends\" width=\"996\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Friends still rakes in $1bn a year in syndication revenue on local networks, TBS and Viacom-owned channels such as MTV.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NBC/NBC via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cClassic television shows that still resonate in 2019 and beyond with viewers, have global appeal and tons of episodes \u2013 that is a relatively short list,\u201d said Rich Greenfield, an a media analyst with LightShed Partners. \u201cIt makes sense that there\u2019s a handful of shows with this massive appeal. And you have more bidders than ever before, so the result is sky-high pricing.\u201d</p> <p>These deals are, in part, an old story, the updated and more comprehensive version of the syndication bidding wars that have long defined rerun television. The popularity of the most juggernaut sitcoms, in particular Friends and Seinfeld, have not demonstrated a reason to be questioned. Seinfeld, which has gone through three rounds of syndication (a round being the amount of time it takes to air all of a show\u2019s episodes on broadcast schedule), has reportedly made over <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/netflix-reaches-streaming-deal-for-seinfeld-11568659938\">$3bn in rerun deals</a>, with TBS believed to be <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2019/09/seinfeld-viacom-cable-rights-comedy-series-comedy-central-paramount-network-tv-land-1202740519/\">paying about $350,000 \u2013 $400,000 per episode</a> in this cycle. Friends still <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2019-08-12/seinfeld-is-the-next-big-prize-in-streaming-wars-as-legacy-media-companies-battle-netflix-for-classic-shows\">rakes in $1bn a year</a> in syndication revenue on local networks, TBS and Viacom-owned channels such as MTV, where it\u2019s become a <a href=\"https://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/old-friends-give-mtv-boost-young-viewers-162728\">ratings boost</a> with viewers younger than the show itself.</p> <p>The Big Bang Theory deal with HBO Max, coming right at the end of the show\u2019s run, is \u201cvery akin to what we\u2019ve seen before in syndication\u201d, said Greenfield. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything new about this \u2013 obviously, these are new platforms, compared to the past, but the concept of key library TV shows having tremendous value has always been true.\u201d</p> <p>The deals have higher values and more bidders than in the past, but the setup is \u201creally no different than if you think about 10 years ago, with TV syndication,\u201d said Greenfield. \u201cThose bidding wars looked just like the bidding wars you\u2019re seeing now.\u201d</p> <p>But these shows\u2019 popularity is newly remarkable given the increasingly niche-driven television market and their popularity with viewers who were too young to watch or not even born when they aired.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s the the fall of 1998. Netflix has launched with 30 employees and 925 DVD titles available to rent. Amazon has just announced its intention to expand beyond selling books online. And Seinfeld, the hugely popular sitcom about daily life in New York City, has wrapped its ninth and final season on NBC. At the time, the enduring appeal of Seinfeld seemed so assured that Turner Broadcasting paid a record sum, over $1m per episode, for the right to broadcast reruns on its channel TBS. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s important to realize the scope of the hit that this show is and the broadcast networks\u2019 inability to continue to generate big, megahit shows like that,\u201d said Bill Burke, the then president of TBS, at the time of the deal\u2019s announcement. Twenty-one years later, Burke\u2019s statement is not quite prophetic \u2013 networks have produced numerous mega-hits, such as The Big Bang Theory and The Office, since Seinfeld went off the air \u2013 but not wrong, either. Much has changed (Netflix\u2019s business, Amazon\u2019s products) but Seinfeld, along with its fellow NBC stalwart Friends, remains broadly popular and inordinately valuable; last month, Netflix paid over $500m for the rights to stream all of Seinfeld\u2019s 180 episodes globally. The sky-high sum for the show about nothing is one of several giant deals in recent months for library rights to legacy shows, representing a new, cash-laden front on the global streaming wars. In July, WarnerMedia outbid Netflix with $425m for all 10 seasons of Friends, which will stream on its forthcoming service HBO Max in spring 2020. A month earlier, Netflix also lost the rights to The Office, one of its most popular shows, to NBCUniversal, who paid $500m to stream the show for five years on its own forthcoming service, Peacock, in 2021. (Netflix will maintain global rights.) And in a deal said to be pushing $1bn, WarnerMedia has secured both the streaming rights (on HBO Max) and broadcast syndication (on TBS) for The Big Bang Theory, the nerd sitcom that ended its run on CBS last year. These pricey deals for what is essentially digital reruns have, like the Seinfeld syndication deal two decades ago, raised eyebrows. Why are streaming companies willing to pay so much for shows of nostalgic value? And as numerous companies prepare to launch their own streaming services \u2013 HBO Max and Peacock, not to mention the forthcoming Apple TV+ \u2013 why bet on the appeal of legacy TV shows? \u201cClassic television shows that still resonate in 2019 and beyond with viewers, have global appeal and tons of episodes \u2013 that is a relatively short list,\u201d said Rich Greenfield, an a media analyst with LightShed Partners. \u201cIt makes sense that there\u2019s a handful of shows with this massive appeal. And you have more bidders than ever before, so the result is sky-high pricing.\u201d These deals are, in part, an old story, the updated and more comprehensive version of the syndication bidding wars that have long defined rerun television. The popularity of the most juggernaut sitcoms, in particular Friends and Seinfeld, have not demonstrated a reason to be questioned. Seinfeld, which has gone through three rounds of syndication (a round being the amount of time it takes to air all of a show\u2019s episodes on broadcast schedule), has reportedly made over $3bn in rerun deals, with TBS believed to be paying about $350,000 \u2013 $400,000 per episode in this cycle. Friends still rakes in $1bn a year in syndication revenue on local networks, TBS and Viacom-owned channels such as MTV, where it\u2019s become a ratings boost with viewers younger than the show itself. The Big Bang Theory deal with HBO Max, coming right at the end of the show\u2019s run, is \u201cvery akin to what we\u2019ve seen before in syndication\u201d, said Greenfield. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything new about this \u2013 obviously, these are new platforms, compared to the past, but the concept of key library TV shows having tremendous value has always been true.\u201d The deals have higher values and more bidders than in the past, but the setup is \u201creally no different than if you think about 10 years ago, with TV syndication,\u201d said Greenfield. \u201cThose bidding wars looked just like the bidding wars you\u2019re seeing now.\u201d But these shows\u2019 popularity is newly remarkable given the increasingly niche-driven television market and their popularity with viewers who were too young to watch or not even born when they aired. Friends is arguably one of the hottest shows for Gen Z, loosely defined as the generation born between 1996 and 2010. The 25th anniversary of its premiere last month launched an outpouring of nostalgic content, a lucrative three-night theatrical event, and vociferous online blowback as to whether the show is any good in the first place. Netflix is notoriously tight-lipped on streaming numbers, but according to Nielsen, The Office and Friends were the most-streamed shows on the platform this year. Given the shows\u2019 hundreds of episodes and low barriers to entry, \u201cGen Z viewers are experiencing The Office and Friends with a kind of urgency and viewing experience that they\u2019ve never really had in their lives,\u201d said Daniel D\u2019Addario, chief TV critic for Variety. He attributes their success to their blend of palatability and humor; as more and more shows are designed for increasingly niche audiences, it\u2019s comforting to turn on and tune out. \u201cThese shows are really built to satisfy your viewing \u2013 they\u2019re big, broad, fun, easygoing. Still well-crafted shows, but shows that are not hard to access.\u201d They\u2019re not, say, Mad Men, the prestige drama whose streaming rights will be shopped by Lionsgate, in a test of how much a library of hour-long, less binge-able episodes can be valued as a tentpole attraction. (Netflix originally bought the streaming rights in 2011 for $1m per episode.) Thus the eye-popping deals from streaming services on classic sitcoms represent a paradox of the television landscape in 2019: as the glut of Peak TV, spurred by streamers\u2019 massive budgets for original programs, produces more and more niche content, the more valuable shows with broad appeal become to streaming services. Netflix\u2019s Seinfeld deal was especially ironic, wrote the TV critic Alison Herman for the Ringer, because it demonstrated how the company whose \u201cmaximum-volume production is predicated on the idea of catering to every possible niche is all but admitting it depends on the old-school hit it\u2019s helped make harder to create than ever\u201d. Which makes the success of these shows behind several different streaming barriers \u2013 be it HBO Max, Netflix, Hulu or Peacock \u2013 more of an open question. Show such as Friends and The Office gained legions of viewers after their runs \u2013 but it\u2019s difficult to assess the balance of inherent appeal versus accessibility. \u201cRight now, Friends is extremely appealing, likely in part because it\u2019s on Netflix,\u201d said D\u2019Addario.

Taylor said the government was making progress on plans to underwrite new power generation, but he said his immediate priority was ensuring there was sufficient dispatchable power in the system to keep the lights on and prices down.",

But questions remain about the practical effects of such a deal, given the drive towards encryption of information that keeps data at arm\u2019s length from the tech companies themselves. The announcement capped a visit to the US by the Australian home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, at the invitation of the US attorney general, William Barr, to attend the Lawless Spaces Summit on warrant-proof encryption and its impact on child exploitation cases. The trip started with Australia joining the US and UK in warning Facebook against going ahead with plans to implement end-to-end encryption in all its messaging unless it creates a backdoor to allow governments to access the content of private communications. Dutton\u2019s trip also included an appearance at a government-industry roundtable alongside the home affairs department secretary, Mike Pezzullo, at which Dutton warned that \u201cexisting policy settings are not keeping pace with \u2026 technological change\u201d. Facebook rebuffs Dutton on backdoors to encryption Law enforcement agencies worldwide are struggling to formulate a response to the increasing use of end-to-end encryption, which protects communications with a code so strong that only the users can read the messages, thwarting the investigation and prosecution of criminal offences.

Dutton told Guardian Australia encryption was \u201cimportant for banking and other uses, but paedophiles are using it to order children and send images of children being raped\u201d. \u201cAll companies, including Facebook, must have zero tolerance when it comes to child exploitation and not allow their platforms to facilitate these sick crimes,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the moment even with a court-ordered warrant police can\u2019t access the messages to use as evidence to prosecute these evil criminals. \u201cYou\u2019re either on the side of vulnerable children or not. It is time for Facebook to pick a side.\u201d Facebook responded by saying it \u201cstrongly opposes government attempts to build backdoors because they would undermine the privacy and security of people everywhere\u201d. \u201cWe believe people have the right to have a private conversation online, wherever they are in the world. \u201cAs the US and UK governments acknowledge, the [Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data \u2013 Cloud] Act allows for companies to provide available information when they receive valid legal requests and does not require companies to build backdoors.\u201d UK strikes Cloud Act deal but Australia still at square one The Cloud Act, passed in 2018, compels US tech companies to hand over data when presented with a warrant by law enforcement agencies. It also allows the US to strike deals with partner countries to provide that data in return for reciprocal cooperation from their agencies and tech companies. On Thursday the UK struck the first Cloud Act deal, which mandated that each country would gain permission before using the data for death penalty prosecutions in the US, or cases implicating freedom of speech in the UK. Australia is still at the first stage of the process to negotiate a deal. Dutton said Australia was very pleased to have entered negotiations but \u201cwe have some way to go before the agreement is finalised\u201d. \u201cOnce in place it will mean service providers based in the United States can respond directly to electronic data requests issued by our enforcement agencies under Australian law for data critical for the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of serious crime,\u201d he said. \u201cCurrent processes for obtaining electronic information held by service providers in other countries risk loss of evidence and unacceptable delays to criminal justice outcomes.\u201d The innovation and entrepreneurship director at the US Studies Centre, Claire McFarland, said it was unclear what conditions Australia would need to meet to reach a deal. \u201cThe mechanism for cooperation that our laws are working on is not keeping pace with the speed of technological change,\u201d she said. \u201cA government-to-government avenue is time consuming, so having an alternative framework between Australia and the US will result in expedited outcomes.\u201d In a statement the US justice department noted the deal would be \u201cunderpinned by Australian legislation yet to be introduced\u201d. Encryption legislation puts US deal at risk, Labor suggests Labor\u2019s shadow home affairs minister, Kristina Keneally, welcomed the proposed deal but questioned whether it would require the Coalition to amend encryption legislation rushed into law in December. The legislation attempts to overcome the problem of encrypted messaging by coopting technology companies, device manufacturers and service providers into building the functionality needed for police to do their spying. The Law Council and tech firms have warned that it could prevent Australia qualifying for a Cloud Act agreement because it may breach the US requirement that foreign countries have robust data privacy protections to receive data from US firms. The council also submitted to a parliamentary inquiry that Australian laws were \u201cinsufficient on their own to compel a service provider in the US to do anything not authorised by US law\u201d. Jerry Nadler, the chairman of the US House of Representatives judiciary committee, wrote to Dutton on 4 October warning the legislation \u201cmay undermine [Australia\u2019s] ability to qualify for an executive agreement under the Cloud Act\u201d. Nadler noted the concerns about the \u201cprofound impact\u201d of the laws, lack of judicial oversight and requested information on the risk of encryption being weakened. The Cloud Act prohibits an agreement from creating \u201cany obligation that providers be capable of decrypting data or limitation that prevents providers from decrypting data\u201d. Keneally told Radio National there were \u201copen and serious questions\u201d about whether \u201cthe Australian law which was passed by the parliament in a significant rush less than 12 months ago \u2026 can conform to the Cloud Act in the United States and allow this type of ability to access encrypted material to become possible\u201d. The Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick said a Cloud Act deal would \u201cneed to be subject to very close scrutiny by the Australian parliament\u201d. \u201cGiven their track record, it is not easy to have confidence that a negotiation undertaken by [Dutton and Pezzullo] will properly protect the data rights and privacy of Australians, including protection of data generated by journalists and media organisations,\u201d he said. Patrick noted that the Cloud Act had been supported by the information giants Microsoft, Apple and Google but had been heavily criticised by civil rights and privacy groups, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the American Civil Liberties Union, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. Patrick said the bilateral deal \u201cshould properly protect the rights and privacy of Australian citizens\u201d, including \u201cstrong protections for journalists and media organisations that may be targeted in the US government\u2019s politically driven crackdown on information leaks, whistleblowers, journalists and media organisations\u201d.",

CTF staff members worked closely with Tory MPs \u2013 including some current ministers \u2013 to undermine Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal, while several senior employees took leave to run Johnson\u2019s Tory leadership campaign.</p> \n<p>The Guardian has exposed CTF\u2019s work on campaigns for the Saudi Arabian government, major fossil fuel producers, anti-cycling campaigners, tobacco firms and sugary drinks producers. Now the Registrar of Consultant Lobbyists has used, for only the fourth time, its powers to formally demand CTF Partners provide detailed evidence that the aims of such clients did not influence staff\u2019s unpaid work with politicians including the PM. Crosby\u2019s company has denied claims it could have broken the law, insisting senior employees\u2019 decision to volunteer on Johnson\u2019s Tory leadership campaign was unconnected with their day jobs. But the investigation could be an incentive for Downing Street to keep Johnson away from his longtime political adviser Crosby. There are reports the pair have fallen out, with Johnson turning instead to his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, and his own partner, Carrie Symonds.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Trump isolated amid Syria chaos \u2013 </strong>The Turkish defence ministry has declared \u201call preparations for a possible military operation into north-eastern Syria are completed\u201d, as Donald Trump faces a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/07/trump-syria-us-troop-withdrawal-turkey\">political backlash from close Republican allies</a> after his decision to withdraw forces from the countries\u2019 border.

The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have said the fate of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/07/us-withdrawal-from-syria-leaves-fate-of-isis-fighters-and-families-in-detention-uncertain\">tens of thousands of suspected Islamic State fighters and their families</a> in its custody is uncertain. It is unclear if Turkey would take custody of them. In Washington the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, said: \u201cA precipitous withdrawal of US forces from Syria would only benefit Russia, Iran and the Assad regime. And it would increase the risk that Isis and other terrorist groups regroup.\u201d The Republican senator and Trump loyalist Lindsey Graham said: \u201cThis decision to abandon our Kurdish allies and turn Syria over to Russia, Iran and Turkey will put every radical Islamist on steroids. Shot in the arm to the bad guys.

In a warning to Boris Johnson as his Brexit plan faces stiff opposition at home and abroad, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said government borrowing was already set to more than double in 2020, hard Brexit or not.

      "bodyText": "Top story: CTF queried over political and corporate work Hello, it\u2019s Warren Murray helping you lift yourself up by the bootstraps this Tuesday morning. Sir Lynton Crosby\u2019s company CTF Partners is under investigation for potential illegal lobbying over its employees\u2019 work for senior Conservatives including Boris Johnson. CTF staff members worked closely with Tory MPs \u2013 including some current ministers \u2013 to undermine Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal, while several senior employees took leave to run Johnson\u2019s Tory leadership campaign. The Guardian has exposed CTF\u2019s work on campaigns for the Saudi Arabian government, major fossil fuel producers, anti-cycling campaigners, tobacco firms and sugary drinks producers. Now the Registrar of Consultant Lobbyists has used, for only the fourth time, its powers to formally demand CTF Partners provide detailed evidence that the aims of such clients did not influence staff\u2019s unpaid work with politicians including the PM. Crosby\u2019s company has denied claims it could have broken the law, insisting senior employees\u2019 decision to volunteer on Johnson\u2019s Tory leadership campaign was unconnected with their day jobs. But the investigation could be an incentive for Downing Street to keep Johnson away from his longtime political adviser Crosby. There are reports the pair have fallen out, with Johnson turning instead to his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, and his own partner, Carrie Symonds. * * * Trump isolated amid Syria chaos \u2013 The Turkish defence ministry has declared \u201call preparations for a possible military operation into north-eastern Syria are completed\u201d, as Donald Trump faces a political backlash from close Republican allies after his decision to withdraw forces from the countries\u2019 border. The president is accused of betraying Kurdish fighters who led the defeat of Isis and leaving them to face a potential Turkish invasion alone. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have said the fate of tens of thousands of suspected Islamic State fighters and their families in its custody is uncertain. It is unclear if Turkey would take custody of them. In Washington the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, said: \u201cA precipitous withdrawal of US forces from Syria would only benefit Russia, Iran and the Assad regime. And it would increase the risk that Isis and other terrorist groups regroup.\u201d The Republican senator and Trump loyalist Lindsey Graham said: \u201cThis decision to abandon our Kurdish allies and turn Syria over to Russia, Iran and Turkey will put every radical Islamist on steroids. Shot in the arm to the bad guys. Devastating for the good guys.\u201d * * * Brexit debt warning \u2013 Emergency tax cuts and higher public spending needed to offset a no-deal Brexit would send government debt to its highest level in more than half a century and could end up forcing a new wave of austerity cuts even as the government moves to increases funding for healthcare, schools and police, according to Britain\u2019s leading experts on the public finances. In a warning to Boris Johnson as his Brexit plan faces stiff opposition at home and abroad, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said government borrowing was already set to more than double in 2020, hard Brexit or not. Leaked EU papers obtained by the Guardian show how Brussels cut Boris Johnson\u2019s Irish border plan to pieces, point by point. This morning Amelia Gentleman tells the story of EU citizens in the UK, some of whom have been residents for 50 years but are now struggling to complete requirements to be allowed to stay. * * * Rebellion far from extinguished \u2013 About 280 people have been arrested after Extinction Rebellion protesters descended on London to begin a two-week blockade.

Outside the MoD, activists attached themselves to cars before being removed by police using buzzsaws. Officers removed a man who had attached himself to a tipi frame on Westminster Bridge, while others who had glued themselves to scaffolding in Trafalgar Square were taken away. Boris Johnson derided the protesters as \u201cuncooperative crusties\u201d who should stop blocking the streets of the capital with their \u201cheaving hemp-smelling bivouacs\u201d.

Zombie invasions may be a well-trodden premise but the writer and director, Adam Miller, uses meta-references to his advantage, turning the 30-minute show into a crossover between a wry sitcom and a fast-paced first-person shooter.<em> Ammar Kalia</em></p> <h2><strong>The Great British Bake Off</strong><br><strong>8pm, Channel 4</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s festival week for the contestants and there is a global spin on the bakes to come.

      "bodyText": "Zomboat! 10pm, ITV2 The zombie apocalypse comes to the Midlands in this gore-filled comedy about two pairs of friends who find themselves escaping the carnage on a painfully slow canal boat from an infected Birmingham to the supposed safe haven of London. Zombie invasions may be a well-trodden premise but the writer and director, Adam Miller, uses meta-references to his advantage, turning the 30-minute show into a crossover between a wry sitcom and a fast-paced first-person shooter. Ammar Kalia The Great British Bake Off 8pm, Channel 4 It\u2019s festival week for the contestants and there is a global spin on the bakes to come. While a signature bake evokes celebrations from around the world, there is also a deep-fried Italian technical to summon up, and, for the showstopper, a fabulous Indonesian celebration cake, which will really prove the bakers\u2019 mettle. Ali Catterall The Capture 9pm, BBC One After last week\u2019s flashbacks brought belated clarity to the CCTV-heavy thriller, some personal peril cranks up the tension for tonight\u2019s finale. But can the fugitive soldier Shaun (Callum Turner) and obdurate cop Rachel (Holliday Grainger) outsmart a shadowy cabal literally designed to control the narrative? Graeme Virtue Snackmasters 9.15pm, Channel 4 Fred Siriex continues his competition of pairing top chefs with the task of recreating the nation\u2019s favourite snacks. This week, it\u2019s playground staple Monster Munch, which is deconstructed by the Michelin-starred chef Matt Worswick and Tristan Welch to often catastrophic results.

Anyone who has lived here continuously for five years should, in theory, be able to get settled status easily; people who have been here for less than five years will be granted \u201cpre-settled\u201d status, requiring them to reapply for permanent status once they have racked up enough years of continuous residence (which means not leaving the country for more than six months a year).</p> <p>For Europeans in the UK, the Home Office\u2019s \u201cEU Exit: ID Document Check\u201d app is the gateway between belonging and exclusion. How well this piece of software works will be a crucial factor in the government\u2019s attempts to present Brexit as a success. In the past year, almost 1.5 million Europeans living in the UK have grappled with the Home Office application process and managed to secure settled or pre-settled status. The Home Office would like us to celebrate this as a bureaucratic success story, and in a very optimistic frame of mind, perhaps we might.</p> <p>The government has allocated about \u00a3460m to the scheme, of which about \u00a350m was spent on developing this unflashy app, its opening pages headed with the outline of a crown on a royal blue background. At the launch of the scheme in March, a Home Office radio advertising campaign reassured people: \u201cIt is free, and all you need is your passport or ID card and to complete an online form.\u201d</p> <p>Former home secretary Amber Rudd was cheerfully optimistic, promising (in an aside that revealed more about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/shortcuts/2018/apr/24/lk-bennett-the-fashion-brand-amber-rudd-reaches-for-in-a-brexit-emergency\" title=\"\">her wardrobe choices</a> than about Home Office reliability) that the digital application process would be as easy to use as setting up an online account at the fashion chain LK Bennett. Home Office figures state that 75% of applicants are completing the identity check \u201capp journey in under eight minutes\u201d.</p> <p>In May, I was taken on a tour of the Home Office\u2019s Liverpool offices, where 1,500 workers were then handling about 6,000 \u201csettled status\u201d applications a day (it has since risen to 20,000). At the end of the tour, one of the senior civil servants in charge of the scheme said it would be good to see media coverage emphasising how well things are working. \u201cIn an ideal world, we want you to write an article saying you have come here, and there\u2019s nothing to be afraid of.\u201d</p> <p>But what is at stake here is so enormous, and the potential for things to go wrong so real, that it is hard to be sure whether people should be feeling confident or apprehensive. Even if the application process achieves an improbably hopeful 95% success rate, it could still have disastrous consequences for those left out \u2013 who could number more than 150,000. (And it is improbable: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/20/brexit-id-scheme-for-eu-citizens-in-uk-will-be-difficult-to-achieve\" title=\"\">a report last year</a> found that take-up rates for similar large-population registrations ranged from 43% in the US to 77% in Spain; the only scheme that came close to a 100% take up was an ID card system in India, but this was after almost \u00a31bn was spent on raising awareness.)</p> <p>After the deadline, those who have failed to apply will gradually be transformed from legal residents into undocumented migrants. In the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/aug/27/hostile-environment-anatomy-of-a-policy-disaster\" title=\"\">hostile environment</a> \u2013 the obstructive and unwelcoming bureaucratic culture promoted by Theresa May when she was home secretary \u2013 they will be unable to work, rent somewhere to live, access free healthcare, drive, open a bank account, get a mobile phone contract or travel without being asked to prove their status. They will gradually discover that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/20/brexit-id-scheme-for-eu-citizens-in-uk-will-be-difficult-to-achieve\" title=\"\">normal life has become impossible</a>.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The Home Office has never attempted a digital exercise on this scale. All the unknowns \u2013 numbers, timing, terms of the deal \u2013 have presented developers with unexpected challenges. By the end of January, two months before it was due to launch nationally, IT specialists working for the Home Office had successfully designed a scheme that charged applicants \u00a365. Days before the app was rolled out for public testing, they were told that the fees were too politically sensitive and needed to be scrapped \u2013 leaving them no time to rebuild the app without the fee pages. So, as an awkward last-minute fix, initial applicants were charged anyway and had to get their money refunded later. The decision to scrap the fee also meant the government instantly lost about \u00a3190m of revenue that the scheme was meant to bring in.</p> <p>\u201cThey were trying to deliver the biggest, most contentious new system that any of them had likely ever worked on, while the basic requirements were changing around them, even days before they went live,\u201d said Joe Owen, the programme director of the Institute for Government, a thinktank working to make government more effective. Owen has been tracing the development of the scheme since the EU referendum.</p> <p>One major problem was that the scheme does not yet work on the iPhone. The Home Office has been struggling with Apple\u2019s refusal to allow third-party developers to use its contactless system since the start of the app\u2019s development. Given that iPhones account for almost half the smartphones in the UK, this creates a major headache for applicants. Many people have had to borrow phones, or take the longer route of sending off their passports for manual scanning. Officials say the app should begin to be available on iPhones later this month.</p> <p>Another complication is that it is not known how many EU nationals there are in the UK. The figure of 3.4 million that the government is basing all its plans on is thought by many to be an underestimate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b81986ae1360a4c71622336b9f68146b8cbba6de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b81986ae1360a4c71622336b9f68146b8cbba6de/0_8_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"EU citizens in London lobbying MPs to guarantee their post-Brexit rights.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">EU citizens in London lobbying MPs to guarantee their post-Brexit rights.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cNobody knows exactly how many are eligible,\u201d said Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford. The government\u2019s estimate was \u201calmost certain to be too low because it doesn\u2019t include people living in non-private addresses like hostels or care homes, and the figures are thought to undercount several groups \u2013 new arrivals, EU/non-EU dual citizens, and people who spend part of the year outside the UK.\u201d</p> <p>Nor does the estimate include close family members from non-EU countries, who are also eligible under this scheme. The total number of people who need to apply could perhaps be as high as 4 million.</p> <p>For the moment the political rhetoric remains warm, and officials say people who have a good reason for missing the deadline will be allowed a \u201creasonable\u201d further period to apply, but the small print spells out the chilling consequences of failing to get status. Although politicians are not currently choosing to highlight this publicly, the Home Office has made it clear in planning documents that, from January 2021 (in a no-deal scenario), anyone without valid UK immigration status \u201cwill be liable to enforcement action, detention and removal as an immigration offender\u201d.</p> <p>It is not surprising that so many of the 3 million-plus are feeling vulnerable and furious. They were demonised by the leave campaign as the problem to which Brexit was the solution; they have faced years of hostile newspaper headlines; they are angry that the scheme has been developed as an application process rather than a registration scheme (meaning that the status is only acquired by successfully applying for it; under a registration scheme, EU citizens who had failed to apply successfully for the status would not immediately become illegal). They point out that this is not the automatic guarantee of rights the Vote Leave campaign and the government promised. Being forced to apply for the right to stay in their homes has been the final insult. For all its royal blue neutrality, many see the app as performing a distasteful political function \u2013 locating them, counting them and classifying them.</p> <p>Meanwhile, all over Europe, about 1.4 million expatriate Britons are anxiously monitoring the scheme, aware that their own treatment could depend largely on how generously the UK government treats EU citizens.</p> <p>In April 2018, it emerged that thousands of people who had been born in Commonwealth countries and moved to the UK as children in the 1960s and 70s, when there was free movement between Britain and its former colonies, had become the victims of changes to immigration legislation. In what became known as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/windrush-scandal\" title=\"\">Windrush scandal</a>, those who had never applied for British passports found themselves wrongly classified as immigration offenders. Some were detained and removed from the UK, back to countries they had not visited in half a century. Others lost their jobs or homes or were denied NHS treatment.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/15/why-the-children-of-windrush-demand-an-immigration-amnesty\" title=\"\">Their experiences</a> have alarmed EU nationals. The scandal highlighted how poor the Home Office\u2019s capacity is for accurately identifying who is living in the UK legally or illegally, and its reputation has crystallised as an institution that combines malice with incompetence. Many of those obliged to apply for the scheme find the prospect of giving all their personal details to the Home Office disturbing.</p> <p>For about a quarter of applicants, the process is more complicated than simply submitting passport details and completing an online form. The Advertising Standards Authority has recently ruled that the reassuring Home Office radio advertisement must not be broadcast again, after a complainant pointed out that in some cases applicants had to provide much more documentation than just a passport or ID card.</p> <p>Since the beginning of the year, Labour has been warning of looming problems with the system, even talking of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/20/brexit-free-movement-cutoff-plans-worse-than-windrush-says-abbott\" title=\"\">Windrush on steroids</a>\u201d. But such warnings are often firmly slapped down as just being part of \u201cproject fear\u201d. (\u201cI find your comparisons to Windrush inappropriate,\u201d Priti Patel, the home secretary, told the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, this month.)</p> <p>There is already concern from immigration lawyers about the upbeat slanting of statistics. The Home Office likes to say that almost 1.5 million people have been granted \u201csome form of status\u201d, but this masks the fact that currently about 40% are getting the inferior pre-settled status, which obliges them to adhere to strict rules on continuous residence for up to a further five years or risk getting pushed out of the system.</p> <p>Even the Conservative and arch Brexiter MEP <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/29/daniel-hannan-the-man-who-brought-you-brexit\" title=\"\">Daniel Hannan</a> has voiced concern on Twitter, warning that he has had cases of EU nationals in his south-east England constituency being denied settled status despite living in the UK for years. \u201cThis is a breach of the assurances I and others gave during the referendum.\u201d He <a href=\"https://twitter.com/danieljhannan/status/1166850898179624967?lang=en\" title=\"\">called on</a> Patel \u201cto sort this out \u2026 before we end up with another Windrush scandal\u201d.</p> <p>Nicolas Hatton, co-founder of the3million, an organisation set up to support EU nationals, describes the decision to introduce an application system with a cut-off date as a timebomb, because so many will fail to apply on time. Switching metaphors, he warns this will be an \u201cillegal immigrants factory \u2026 designed to create thousands and thousands of illegal immigrants\u201d.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>At the Home Office building in Liverpool, where many of the 1,500 people employed to process the applications are based, there is a relentlessly positive atmosphere. Everyone here is aware of the damage done to the Home Office\u2019s reputation by Windrush. In recent years, the Home Office has been condemned by politicians for being steeped in a \u201cculture of disbelief\u201d, where staff are expected to probe for tiny inconsistencies in the accounts of refugees, and where officials are instructed to \u201cdeport first, hear appeals later\u201d.</p> <p>Many Windrush victims described how they had tried repeatedly to explain that they were not illegal immigrants, but had been ignored, or simply unable to find a Home Office caseworker ready to listen. Before she resigned, Amber Rudd apologised for the \u201cappalling\u201d actions of her own department, blaming a culture in the Home Office which had \u201clost sight of individuals\u201d and become \u201ctoo concerned with policy\u201d. In turn, her successor Sajid Javid promised to introduce a \u201cfairer, more compassionate\u201d immigration system. This hasn\u2019t materialised in most of the department, according to immigration lawyers and caseworkers, but in these open-plan offices in Liverpool, up an escalator, above a Tesco and a florist, something does appear to have changed.</p> <p>Officials are working to instil a new, friendlier ethos within the department dealing with EU nationals. Drawings of cups of tea (with the teabags still in) have been chosen for the branding of the Home Office campaign, to evoke a friendly message of welcome. \u201cWe are absolutely, and I can\u2019t stress this enough, not trying to say no,\u201d one of the senior civil servants (who asked not to be named) said. \u201cThis is about trying to grant the right. This is not about trying to trip people up. This [application] is something people don\u2019t want to do, and we get that, but we\u2019ve set this up from scratch. All this is here to try to say yes to European citizens, to try to give them their rights.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>If things are working, the full application should take about 15 minutes (there are a few more questions on residency and criminality once ID checks are completed). Under the new scheme, the Home Office doesn\u2019t care if applicants are self-sufficient, studying or working \u2013 simply whether they are resident in the UK or not; this is verified by making instant checks with HMRC. Applicants have to do three things: prove their identity, show that they live in the UK and declare any criminal convictions. Once data has been scanned from people\u2019s passports via their phone, they have to take a selfie, so the app can identify if the correct person is applying. The app checks identity through facial matching in the same way travellers are checked in airports at e-passport gates.</p> <p>To reduce the possibility of fraud, there is no physical document at the end of the process, just a digital record, which can be shared with a landlord or an employer (after Brexit, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/07/eu-citizens-in-uk-private-tenancies-brexit-landlords\" title=\"\">they will have to check</a> EU nationals\u2019 eligibility) via a time-limited unique code, on a smartphone.</p> <p>On one floor in Liverpool, staff sit at computers flicking through screens. A passport photograph flashes up, and the employee checks to make sure it matches the selfie taken and submitted through the app. Although much of the system is automated, every case is checked by a human before a decision is made. These human checks can take just 10 minutes. Some people are getting an email back telling them they have settled status within a couple of hours.</p> <p>When I visited, there was a homely smell of microwaved stew; helium balloons hovered over the desk of someone who had been given a baby shower. Special EU Settlement Resolution Centre teacups have been printed for staff, with inspirational slogans on them. Most of the staff are newly hired, many of them students. One of the few longer-serving members of staff, who has worked at the Home Office for five years, said it was a relief not to have to be so sceptical when dealing with people\u2019s applications. \u201cBefore the onus was more on \u2018prove it\u2019. Now we are doing everything we can to help,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I first joined, it was noticeable that not many cases would result in us issuing the applicant with what they needed.\u201d</p> <p>The only people likely to be refused will be those with \u201cpersistent and serious\u201d criminal records and, so far, only one person has been refused \u2013 although a number of people have been dismayed to get the lesser, more precarious pre-settled status, despite having been in the UK for more than five years. Campaigners suspect that the difficult cases may be going to the bottom of the pile, to keep the figures looking favourable.</p> <p>When the project began, one of the senior civil servants in charge ordered a number of copies of a book called In Limbo, compiled by an Italian translator Elena Remigi, so he and colleagues could read the 144 testimonies of EU nationals resident in Britain, people who were worried about their post-Brexit future here, people who are, the blurb says, \u201chaunted by the poignant question: where is home?\u201d They say the book helped them understand the worries faced by those being asked to apply. Videos have been made for people who struggle with literacy, there is helpline assistance for those who are not confident with technology. The guidance has been translated into all 26 languages (although the helpline advice is only available in English and Welsh). In addition, \u00a39m has been allocated to funding charities (organisations such as Citizens Advice and the East European Resource Centre) to help an estimated 200,000 vulnerable or hard to reach people to apply. Downstairs there is a hotline; this is the first time in 10 years that people have been able to call a Home Office number and speak to a caseworker, rather than an employee at an outsourced firm, reading from a script.</p> <p>In August, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/19/threat-to-end-freedom-of-movement-overnight-reckless-say-eu-citizens\" title=\"\">Patel announced</a> an end to freedom of movement in a no-deal scenario at the end of next month. Officials quickly had to clarify on her behalf that free movement would not be ending on that date (since EU law continues to apply until its legal foundation is repealed). Unfortunately, the home secretary\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/20/eu-citizen-uk-priti-patel-britain-brexit\" title=\"\">premature announcement</a> led to a spike in calls leading to long waiting times.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying to change the perception of the Home Office,\u201d the woman who heads the call centre said. Staff have dealt with a lot of people who were \u201cupset, frightened and angry\u201d, she said. \u201cWe understand why. This is something that has happened to those people. They weren\u2019t consulted or even given a vote in it. They are now having to apply for something that they always had.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Windrush victims waited years for anyone to pay attention to their difficulties with the Home Office, as they lost jobs and homes and faced detention. By comparison, a mildly famous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/30/french-chef-richard-bertinet-settled-status-uk\" title=\"\">French baker</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/may/18/uk-based-poles-call-for-revolt-against-having-to-apply-for-settled-status\" title=\"\">Polish chef</a> struggling with the EU status app need only send an irritated Tweet for <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/brexit-and-settled-status-ive-lived-in-britain-for-44-years-but-this-year-i-was-scared-id-have-to-leave-rw0lrp9zr\" title=\"\">newspapers to print</a> outraged articles. The reality TV celebrity <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/03/home-office-help-high-profile-eu-citizens-fred-sirieix\" title=\"\">Fred Sirieix</a>, after tweeting his frustration, had calls from the Home Office within 24 hours to resolve things. Home Office staff seem at pains to act fast to resolve high-profile cases, to quell the noise; but less clear is what happens to those who have less of a public profile.</p> <p>For some people, the experience is genuinely easy. Some people describe doing it while sitting on the sofa at home, and being pleasantly surprised at getting an email confirming that they have been granted settled status within hours. The difficulty is that while around three-quarters are getting through easily and a quarter need to submit further information, a small proportion will have more complicated experiences.</p> <p>We already know that too many people are wrongly being allocated pre-settled status instead of the more permanent settled status, a problem that came up during the testing phase, Home Office staff told me. \u201cOne of the things we were surprised about in early testing was that people thought they were clicking the button for full settled status, but they were actually accepting pre-settled status, and then being surprised. So we tried to make quite a lot of changes to the guidance to reinforce that,\u201d an official said.</p> <p>But the problem persists, and campaigners say there are still oddities in the design of the application form, which does not ask people how long they have lived in the UK or which status they hope to get. Only the most well-informed applicants will know they can challenge an incorrect allocation of pre-settled status.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"378b472e55208ac8d20e929fd2b4d96914a6a658\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/378b472e55208ac8d20e929fd2b4d96914a6a658/429_520_2794_1676/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Home secretary Priti Patel speaking at the Conservative party conference in Manchester earlier this month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Home secretary Priti Patel speaking at the Conservative party conference in Manchester earlier this month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The immigration lawyer Chris Desira has spoken to audiences of EU nationals at more than 200 information sessions arranged by embassies and community groups all over the UK in the past three years. He has identified many vulnerable groups who might find it hard to supply the evidence required to prove that they qualify for settled status \u2013 elderly people, people with disabilities, children in care, stay-at-home women who haven\u2019t worked or paid bills, and victims of domestic abuse whose partners have all their papers. He is conscious that the awareness of the need to apply has not got through to everyone. \u201cI am massively worried, massively,\u201d said Desira. </p> <p>He has seen older people who have been here for decades crying in meetings, worried they are going to be put on a plane out of the country. \u201cEven when you tell them, \u2018I am confident that if you fill in this form, you will be fine, you will get settled status\u2019, the anxiety and the stress and everything that is happening around them prevents them from hearing that message.\u201d</p> <p>His concerns are echoed by Chai Patel of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, who warns that the scheme is set up to be easy for people who are \u201cwealthy, well-educated people\u201d. He is concerned at the absence of a physical document proving status. \u201cThe scheme is very easy if you know your rights, you\u2019re online and you\u2019re bolshie enough to be able to stand up for what you\u2019re entitled to. It won\u2019t work so well for the more vulnerable. We are expecting hundreds of thousands of people to be left without status if the scheme continues as it is,\u201d he said.</p> <p>I met Chris Desira at an event organised in a central London YMCA hall by the German embassy earlier this year, where he and two German diplomats, attempted to answer the questions of people confused by what they needed to do in order to ensure they could continue to live in the UK. While the official line appeared to be \u201cDon\u2019t panic\u201d, the cumulative effect of almost two hours of anxious questions left many feeling disturbed.</p> <p>One by one, German citizens stood up to voice their alarm. \u201cIt\u2019s giving me stomach ache. I\u2019ve been here since 1961,\u201d one woman said, before being reassured that she simply needed to make the application, and she would be fine. (Stephanie Dawoud of the immigration charity Imix, who was translating into my ear, said most of the meetings she had attended had a similar feeling of distress, particularly among older people, who were particularly worried by the unfamiliar notion of apps and applying digitally.) A woman in her 30s was worried about whether she should transfer her business out of the country.</p> <p>The German diplomat presiding over the occasion (who asked not to be named) exhibited a mournful sense of humour at some of the questions.</p> <p>\u201cWhat happens to German civil servants?\u201d someone asked.</p> <p>\u201cI would love to know that, too!\u201d the diplomat replied.</p> <p>\u201cCan I come into the country after Brexit?\u201d one woman asked.</p> <p>\u201cYes, unless you scare the people are the border into thinking you are a threat to national security,\u201d said the diplomat.</p> <p>\u201cShould I stockpile food?\u201d another wanted to know, to wry laughter from the room.</p> <p>\u201cThe exciting thing is that you\u2019re jumping into a big black hole,\u201d the diplomat replied.</p> <p>There were questions about eligibility to healthcare in a no-deal scenario, questions about how to apply for dual nationality and questions about how UK pensions would be uprated if they were paid in Germany. \u201cI have no information whatsoever on how it will pan out. You don\u2019t know what the British government will do,\u201d the diplomat said sadly. </p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Doris Ratnam was at the back of the room, wondering how she was going to organise herself to apply. She had left her small Black Forest village near Baden Baden in 1968, aged 20, hoping to learn English, a language that neither of her parents spoke. She married a Malaysian citizen in London; he became naturalised decades ago, but she didn\u2019t want to, because for a long time it was difficult to get British citizenship without losing your German passport. (That changed in the pre-Brexit period.)</p> <p>She felt disheartened at applying for a status she considered to be hers already, as well as alarmed by the digital application. She invited me to watch the process of using the app in May, at her neat north-west London home, reached through a garden of pink roses and trimmed hedges. \u201cI\u2019ve been paying taxes here for 50 years, it should be simple,\u201d she said, offering me coffee and ginger snaps.</p> <p>But her passport could not be read by the app, even though she had travelled through a passport e-gate, which uses the same technology, only four days earlier.</p> <p>The process of applying had made her think about her attitudes to Britishness. \u201cI find it difficult to know after all this time whether I feel at home here. I certainly don\u2019t feel British, like a British person, but I have English friends \u2026 I feel in-between; I feel both. There\u2019s a saying: the British are too polite to be honest, the Germans are too honest to be polite. I think there is something in it.\u201d</p> <p>On the helpline, after much time listening to jangly hold music, the Home Office helper was both polite and honest, but had no answer as to why the app was not reading the digital code. She was advised to seek out one of the 80 designated EU settlement scheme scanning offices (in council offices and town hall register offices) where the passport could be scanned manually.</p> <p>It took weeks for Ratnam to get an appointment at Ealing town hall, but she finally went on 4 July, consulting a photocopied map to find room 1.13, winding right, then left along echoing corridors, then right, then left again, up some marble steps, past a bust of Chopin through the beautiful, almost empty mock-gothic building, soon to be decommissioned and turned into a boutique hotel. Once we arrived at a small, pink-doored room, the official inside was unable to help, also attempting to swipe the passport on a phone until the system locked her out, too. So Ratnam then sat in the waiting room on the phone to the resolution centre in Liverpool for another 40 minutes , asking for help. \u201cI can only advise that the application is locked for 24 hours. We can\u2019t override that,\u201d an official said. \u201cFor the time being there is nothing further we can do to help.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just fed up,\u201d Ratnam said, a red flush of worry creeping up her neck. \u201cI\u2019m getting worked up; I can\u2019t even get my words out. I don\u2019t want to keep trying.\u201d</p> <p>She organised a second appointment at the town hall on 10 July. The passport was finally scanned, quite easily, that day, but two days later she received an email asking her to upload an image of her old passport showing a historic stamp giving her indefinite leave to remain. The same email told her that the Home Office could find no record of her indefinite leave to remain and wanted to \u201cconfirm that you are related to your EU family member as claimed\u201d. The email was a mistake. She couldn\u2019t work out how to upload the passport; there was another long phone call to Liverpool on 15 July, after which she managed to send off the picture.</p> <p>\u201cI can hear it in your voice, how anxious you are,\u201d a call handler told her.</p> <p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you just check my HMRC records?\u201d Ratnam asked. \u201cI\u2019ve been paying tax for long enough.\u201d</p> <p>On 16 July, an email arrived telling her that her documents had been sent in an \u201cunsupported format and we have been unable to attach the files to your application\u201d. But puzzlingly, a minute later, a second email arrived, saying that her \u201capplication to the EU Settlement Scheme has been successful\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/may/17/champion-boxer-caught-in-britains-immigration-dragnet-kelvin-bilal-fawaz-operation-nexus\">How a champion boxer got caught in Britain\u2019s immigration dragnet</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ratnam has managed to secure her status.

      "bodyText": "In early May, Doris Ratnam sat at her kitchen table, trying to scan her German passport with her mobile phone. She was applying for \u201csettled status\u201d in the UK, the new immigration status most of the 3.4 million or so EU nationals living in Britain need to acquire if they want to stay in the country legally after Brexit. Ratnam, who is 72 and has lived in London since arriving as an au pair in 1968, was annoyed that she felt obliged to apply under the scheme to remain more securely in a country she considers her home. She was flustered by the process of attempting to get her phone to suck all her personal details out of her passport. Something was not working, and we sat for 20 minutes in near silence as she moved the phone slowly over the cover of the passport, as shown in a reassuring Home Office Youtube video, trying to get it to read the chip hidden inside the document. \u201cMove the phone to read the chip,\u201d Ratnam muttered, studying the guidance notes. \u201cWhat am I supposed to do? Move the phone to find the chip. I feel stressed \u2026 it\u2019s the technology.\u201d After repeated failed attempts, the app informed her she had been locked out of the system for 24 hours. It would take two-and-a-half months, two visits to the local town hall (an hour on two buses each way), a \u00a315 appointment fee and numerous calls to a Home Office helpline before her status was approved. The process was dispiriting. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be made to feel like a foreigner again after such a long time here,\u201d she said. Before the end of June 2021, if Britain leaves the EU with a deal, or by 31 December 2020 with no deal, most EU nationals resident in the UK must have applied for settled status if they want to continue living and working here. The EU settled status scheme is designed to fulfil the government\u2019s promise that all EU citizens, their family members, and dependants living here before Brexit, will be entitled to remain, with no diminishment of their rights. Anyone who has lived here continuously for five years should, in theory, be able to get settled status easily; people who have been here for less than five years will be granted \u201cpre-settled\u201d status, requiring them to reapply for permanent status once they have racked up enough years of continuous residence (which means not leaving the country for more than six months a year). For Europeans in the UK, the Home Office\u2019s \u201cEU Exit: ID Document Check\u201d app is the gateway between belonging and exclusion. How well this piece of software works will be a crucial factor in the government\u2019s attempts to present Brexit as a success. In the past year, almost 1.5 million Europeans living in the UK have grappled with the Home Office application process and managed to secure settled or pre-settled status. The Home Office would like us to celebrate this as a bureaucratic success story, and in a very optimistic frame of mind, perhaps we might. The government has allocated about \u00a3460m to the scheme, of which about \u00a350m was spent on developing this unflashy app, its opening pages headed with the outline of a crown on a royal blue background. At the launch of the scheme in March, a Home Office radio advertising campaign reassured people: \u201cIt is free, and all you need is your passport or ID card and to complete an online form.\u201d Former home secretary Amber Rudd was cheerfully optimistic, promising (in an aside that revealed more about her wardrobe choices than about Home Office reliability) that the digital application process would be as easy to use as setting up an online account at the fashion chain LK Bennett. Home Office figures state that 75% of applicants are completing the identity check \u201capp journey in under eight minutes\u201d. In May, I was taken on a tour of the Home Office\u2019s Liverpool offices, where 1,500 workers were then handling about 6,000 \u201csettled status\u201d applications a day (it has since risen to 20,000). At the end of the tour, one of the senior civil servants in charge of the scheme said it would be good to see media coverage emphasising how well things are working. \u201cIn an ideal world, we want you to write an article saying you have come here, and there\u2019s nothing to be afraid of.\u201d But what is at stake here is so enormous, and the potential for things to go wrong so real, that it is hard to be sure whether people should be feeling confident or apprehensive. Even if the application process achieves an improbably hopeful 95% success rate, it could still have disastrous consequences for those left out \u2013 who could number more than 150,000. (And it is improbable: a report last year found that take-up rates for similar large-population registrations ranged from 43% in the US to 77% in Spain; the only scheme that came close to a 100% take up was an ID card system in India, but this was after almost \u00a31bn was spent on raising awareness.) After the deadline, those who have failed to apply will gradually be transformed from legal residents into undocumented migrants. In the hostile environment \u2013 the obstructive and unwelcoming bureaucratic culture promoted by Theresa May when she was home secretary \u2013 they will be unable to work, rent somewhere to live, access free healthcare, drive, open a bank account, get a mobile phone contract or travel without being asked to prove their status. They will gradually discover that normal life has become impossible. * * * The Home Office has never attempted a digital exercise on this scale. All the unknowns \u2013 numbers, timing, terms of the deal \u2013 have presented developers with unexpected challenges. By the end of January, two months before it was due to launch nationally, IT specialists working for the Home Office had successfully designed a scheme that charged applicants \u00a365. Days before the app was rolled out for public testing, they were told that the fees were too politically sensitive and needed to be scrapped \u2013 leaving them no time to rebuild the app without the fee pages. So, as an awkward last-minute fix, initial applicants were charged anyway and had to get their money refunded later. The decision to scrap the fee also meant the government instantly lost about \u00a3190m of revenue that the scheme was meant to bring in. \u201cThey were trying to deliver the biggest, most contentious new system that any of them had likely ever worked on, while the basic requirements were changing around them, even days before they went live,\u201d said Joe Owen, the programme director of the Institute for Government, a thinktank working to make government more effective. Owen has been tracing the development of the scheme since the EU referendum. One major problem was that the scheme does not yet work on the iPhone. The Home Office has been struggling with Apple\u2019s refusal to allow third-party developers to use its contactless system since the start of the app\u2019s development. Given that iPhones account for almost half the smartphones in the UK, this creates a major headache for applicants. Many people have had to borrow phones, or take the longer route of sending off their passports for manual scanning. Officials say the app should begin to be available on iPhones later this month. Another complication is that it is not known how many EU nationals there are in the UK. The figure of 3.4 million that the government is basing all its plans on is thought by many to be an underestimate. \u201cNobody knows exactly how many are eligible,\u201d said Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford. The government\u2019s estimate was \u201calmost certain to be too low because it doesn\u2019t include people living in non-private addresses like hostels or care homes, and the figures are thought to undercount several groups \u2013 new arrivals, EU/non-EU dual citizens, and people who spend part of the year outside the UK.\u201d Nor does the estimate include close family members from non-EU countries, who are also eligible under this scheme. The total number of people who need to apply could perhaps be as high as 4 million. For the moment the political rhetoric remains warm, and officials say people who have a good reason for missing the deadline will be allowed a \u201creasonable\u201d further period to apply, but the small print spells out the chilling consequences of failing to get status. Although politicians are not currently choosing to highlight this publicly, the Home Office has made it clear in planning documents that, from January 2021 (in a no-deal scenario), anyone without valid UK immigration status \u201cwill be liable to enforcement action, detention and removal as an immigration offender\u201d. It is not surprising that so many of the 3 million-plus are feeling vulnerable and furious. They were demonised by the leave campaign as the problem to which Brexit was the solution; they have faced years of hostile newspaper headlines; they are angry that the scheme has been developed as an application process rather than a registration scheme (meaning that the status is only acquired by successfully applying for it; under a registration scheme, EU citizens who had failed to apply successfully for the status would not immediately become illegal). They point out that this is not the automatic guarantee of rights the Vote Leave campaign and the government promised. Being forced to apply for the right to stay in their homes has been the final insult. For all its royal blue neutrality, many see the app as performing a distasteful political function \u2013 locating them, counting them and classifying them. Meanwhile, all over Europe, about 1.4 million expatriate Britons are anxiously monitoring the scheme, aware that their own treatment could depend largely on how generously the UK government treats EU citizens. In April 2018, it emerged that thousands of people who had been born in Commonwealth countries and moved to the UK as children in the 1960s and 70s, when there was free movement between Britain and its former colonies, had become the victims of changes to immigration legislation. In what became known as the Windrush scandal, those who had never applied for British passports found themselves wrongly classified as immigration offenders. Some were detained and removed from the UK, back to countries they had not visited in half a century. Others lost their jobs or homes or were denied NHS treatment. Their experiences have alarmed EU nationals. The scandal highlighted how poor the Home Office\u2019s capacity is for accurately identifying who is living in the UK legally or illegally, and its reputation has crystallised as an institution that combines malice with incompetence. Many of those obliged to apply for the scheme find the prospect of giving all their personal details to the Home Office disturbing. For about a quarter of applicants, the process is more complicated than simply submitting passport details and completing an online form. The Advertising Standards Authority has recently ruled that the reassuring Home Office radio advertisement must not be broadcast again, after a complainant pointed out that in some cases applicants had to provide much more documentation than just a passport or ID card. Since the beginning of the year, Labour has been warning of looming problems with the system, even talking of \u201cWindrush on steroids\u201d. But such warnings are often firmly slapped down as just being part of \u201cproject fear\u201d. (\u201cI find your comparisons to Windrush inappropriate,\u201d Priti Patel, the home secretary, told the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, this month.) There is already concern from immigration lawyers about the upbeat slanting of statistics. The Home Office likes to say that almost 1.5 million people have been granted \u201csome form of status\u201d, but this masks the fact that currently about 40% are getting the inferior pre-settled status, which obliges them to adhere to strict rules on continuous residence for up to a further five years or risk getting pushed out of the system. Even the Conservative and arch Brexiter MEP Daniel Hannan has voiced concern on Twitter, warning that he has had cases of EU nationals in his south-east England constituency being denied settled status despite living in the UK for years. \u201cThis is a breach of the assurances I and others gave during the referendum.\u201d He called on Patel \u201cto sort this out \u2026 before we end up with another Windrush scandal\u201d. Nicolas Hatton, co-founder of the3million, an organisation set up to support EU nationals, describes the decision to introduce an application system with a cut-off date as a timebomb, because so many will fail to apply on time. Switching metaphors, he warns this will be an \u201cillegal immigrants factory \u2026 designed to create thousands and thousands of illegal immigrants\u201d. * * * At the Home Office building in Liverpool, where many of the 1,500 people employed to process the applications are based, there is a relentlessly positive atmosphere. Everyone here is aware of the damage done to the Home Office\u2019s reputation by Windrush. In recent years, the Home Office has been condemned by politicians for being steeped in a \u201cculture of disbelief\u201d, where staff are expected to probe for tiny inconsistencies in the accounts of refugees, and where officials are instructed to \u201cdeport first, hear appeals later\u201d. Many Windrush victims described how they had tried repeatedly to explain that they were not illegal immigrants, but had been ignored, or simply unable to find a Home Office caseworker ready to listen. Before she resigned, Amber Rudd apologised for the \u201cappalling\u201d actions of her own department, blaming a culture in the Home Office which had \u201clost sight of individuals\u201d and become \u201ctoo concerned with policy\u201d. In turn, her successor Sajid Javid promised to introduce a \u201cfairer, more compassionate\u201d immigration system. This hasn\u2019t materialised in most of the department, according to immigration lawyers and caseworkers, but in these open-plan offices in Liverpool, up an escalator, above a Tesco and a florist, something does appear to have changed. Officials are working to instil a new, friendlier ethos within the department dealing with EU nationals. Drawings of cups of tea (with the teabags still in) have been chosen for the branding of the Home Office campaign, to evoke a friendly message of welcome. \u201cWe are absolutely, and I can\u2019t stress this enough, not trying to say no,\u201d one of the senior civil servants (who asked not to be named) said. \u201cThis is about trying to grant the right. This is not about trying to trip people up. This [application] is something people don\u2019t want to do, and we get that, but we\u2019ve set this up from scratch. All this is here to try to say yes to European citizens, to try to give them their rights.\u201d If things are working, the full application should take about 15 minutes (there are a few more questions on residency and criminality once ID checks are completed). Under the new scheme, the Home Office doesn\u2019t care if applicants are self-sufficient, studying or working \u2013 simply whether they are resident in the UK or not; this is verified by making instant checks with HMRC. Applicants have to do three things: prove their identity, show that they live in the UK and declare any criminal convictions. Once data has been scanned from people\u2019s passports via their phone, they have to take a selfie, so the app can identify if the correct person is applying. The app checks identity through facial matching in the same way travellers are checked in airports at e-passport gates. To reduce the possibility of fraud, there is no physical document at the end of the process, just a digital record, which can be shared with a landlord or an employer (after Brexit, they will have to check EU nationals\u2019 eligibility) via a time-limited unique code, on a smartphone. On one floor in Liverpool, staff sit at computers flicking through screens. A passport photograph flashes up, and the employee checks to make sure it matches the selfie taken and submitted through the app. Although much of the system is automated, every case is checked by a human before a decision is made. These human checks can take just 10 minutes. Some people are getting an email back telling them they have settled status within a couple of hours. When I visited, there was a homely smell of microwaved stew; helium balloons hovered over the desk of someone who had been given a baby shower. Special EU Settlement Resolution Centre teacups have been printed for staff, with inspirational slogans on them. Most of the staff are newly hired, many of them students. One of the few longer-serving members of staff, who has worked at the Home Office for five years, said it was a relief not to have to be so sceptical when dealing with people\u2019s applications. \u201cBefore the onus was more on \u2018prove it\u2019. Now we are doing everything we can to help,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I first joined, it was noticeable that not many cases would result in us issuing the applicant with what they needed.\u201d The only people likely to be refused will be those with \u201cpersistent and serious\u201d criminal records and, so far, only one person has been refused \u2013 although a number of people have been dismayed to get the lesser, more precarious pre-settled status, despite having been in the UK for more than five years. Campaigners suspect that the difficult cases may be going to the bottom of the pile, to keep the figures looking favourable. When the project began, one of the senior civil servants in charge ordered a number of copies of a book called In Limbo, compiled by an Italian translator Elena Remigi, so he and colleagues could read the 144 testimonies of EU nationals resident in Britain, people who were worried about their post-Brexit future here, people who are, the blurb says, \u201chaunted by the poignant question: where is home?\u201d They say the book helped them understand the worries faced by those being asked to apply. Videos have been made for people who struggle with literacy, there is helpline assistance for those who are not confident with technology. The guidance has been translated into all 26 languages (although the helpline advice is only available in English and Welsh). In addition, \u00a39m has been allocated to funding charities (organisations such as Citizens Advice and the East European Resource Centre) to help an estimated 200,000 vulnerable or hard to reach people to apply. Downstairs there is a hotline; this is the first time in 10 years that people have been able to call a Home Office number and speak to a caseworker, rather than an employee at an outsourced firm, reading from a script. In August, Patel announced an end to freedom of movement in a no-deal scenario at the end of next month. Officials quickly had to clarify on her behalf that free movement would not be ending on that date (since EU law continues to apply until its legal foundation is repealed). Unfortunately, the home secretary\u2019s premature announcement led to a spike in calls leading to long waiting times. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to change the perception of the Home Office,\u201d the woman who heads the call centre said. Staff have dealt with a lot of people who were \u201cupset, frightened and angry\u201d, she said. \u201cWe understand why. This is something that has happened to those people. They weren\u2019t consulted or even given a vote in it. They are now having to apply for something that they always had.\u201d * * * Windrush victims waited years for anyone to pay attention to their difficulties with the Home Office, as they lost jobs and homes and faced detention. By comparison, a mildly famous French baker or Polish chef struggling with the EU status app need only send an irritated Tweet for newspapers to print outraged articles. The reality TV celebrity Fred Sirieix, after tweeting his frustration, had calls from the Home Office within 24 hours to resolve things. Home Office staff seem at pains to act fast to resolve high-profile cases, to quell the noise; but less clear is what happens to those who have less of a public profile. For some people, the experience is genuinely easy. Some people describe doing it while sitting on the sofa at home, and being pleasantly surprised at getting an email confirming that they have been granted settled status within hours. The difficulty is that while around three-quarters are getting through easily and a quarter need to submit further information, a small proportion will have more complicated experiences. We already know that too many people are wrongly being allocated pre-settled status instead of the more permanent settled status, a problem that came up during the testing phase, Home Office staff told me. \u201cOne of the things we were surprised about in early testing was that people thought they were clicking the button for full settled status, but they were actually accepting pre-settled status, and then being surprised. So we tried to make quite a lot of changes to the guidance to reinforce that,\u201d an official said. But the problem persists, and campaigners say there are still oddities in the design of the application form, which does not ask people how long they have lived in the UK or which status they hope to get. Only the most well-informed applicants will know they can challenge an incorrect allocation of pre-settled status. The immigration lawyer Chris Desira has spoken to audiences of EU nationals at more than 200 information sessions arranged by embassies and community groups all over the UK in the past three years. He has identified many vulnerable groups who might find it hard to supply the evidence required to prove that they qualify for settled status \u2013 elderly people, people with disabilities, children in care, stay-at-home women who haven\u2019t worked or paid bills, and victims of domestic abuse whose partners have all their papers. He is conscious that the awareness of the need to apply has not got through to everyone. \u201cI am massively worried, massively,\u201d said Desira. He has seen older people who have been here for decades crying in meetings, worried they are going to be put on a plane out of the country. \u201cEven when you tell them, \u2018I am confident that if you fill in this form, you will be fine, you will get settled status\u2019, the anxiety and the stress and everything that is happening around them prevents them from hearing that message.\u201d His concerns are echoed by Chai Patel of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, who warns that the scheme is set up to be easy for people who are \u201cwealthy, well-educated people\u201d. He is concerned at the absence of a physical document proving status. \u201cThe scheme is very easy if you know your rights, you\u2019re online and you\u2019re bolshie enough to be able to stand up for what you\u2019re entitled to. It won\u2019t work so well for the more vulnerable. We are expecting hundreds of thousands of people to be left without status if the scheme continues as it is,\u201d he said. I met Chris Desira at an event organised in a central London YMCA hall by the German embassy earlier this year, where he and two German diplomats, attempted to answer the questions of people confused by what they needed to do in order to ensure they could continue to live in the UK. While the official line appeared to be \u201cDon\u2019t panic\u201d, the cumulative effect of almost two hours of anxious questions left many feeling disturbed. One by one, German citizens stood up to voice their alarm. \u201cIt\u2019s giving me stomach ache. I\u2019ve been here since 1961,\u201d one woman said, before being reassured that she simply needed to make the application, and she would be fine. (Stephanie Dawoud of the immigration charity Imix, who was translating into my ear, said most of the meetings she had attended had a similar feeling of distress, particularly among older people, who were particularly worried by the unfamiliar notion of apps and applying digitally.) A woman in her 30s was worried about whether she should transfer her business out of the country. The German diplomat presiding over the occasion (who asked not to be named) exhibited a mournful sense of humour at some of the questions. \u201cWhat happens to German civil servants?\u201d someone asked. \u201cI would love to know that, too!\u201d the diplomat replied. \u201cCan I come into the country after Brexit?\u201d one woman asked. \u201cYes, unless you scare the people are the border into thinking you are a threat to national security,\u201d said the diplomat. \u201cShould I stockpile food?\u201d another wanted to know, to wry laughter from the room. \u201cThe exciting thing is that you\u2019re jumping into a big black hole,\u201d the diplomat replied. There were questions about eligibility to healthcare in a no-deal scenario, questions about how to apply for dual nationality and questions about how UK pensions would be uprated if they were paid in Germany. \u201cI have no information whatsoever on how it will pan out. You don\u2019t know what the British government will do,\u201d the diplomat said sadly. * * * Doris Ratnam was at the back of the room, wondering how she was going to organise herself to apply. She had left her small Black Forest village near Baden Baden in 1968, aged 20, hoping to learn English, a language that neither of her parents spoke. She married a Malaysian citizen in London; he became naturalised decades ago, but she didn\u2019t want to, because for a long time it was difficult to get British citizenship without losing your German passport. (That changed in the pre-Brexit period.) She felt disheartened at applying for a status she considered to be hers already, as well as alarmed by the digital application. She invited me to watch the process of using the app in May, at her neat north-west London home, reached through a garden of pink roses and trimmed hedges. \u201cI\u2019ve been paying taxes here for 50 years, it should be simple,\u201d she said, offering me coffee and ginger snaps. But her passport could not be read by the app, even though she had travelled through a passport e-gate, which uses the same technology, only four days earlier. The process of applying had made her think about her attitudes to Britishness. \u201cI find it difficult to know after all this time whether I feel at home here. I certainly don\u2019t feel British, like a British person, but I have English friends \u2026 I feel in-between; I feel both. There\u2019s a saying: the British are too polite to be honest, the Germans are too honest to be polite. I think there is something in it.\u201d On the helpline, after much time listening to jangly hold music, the Home Office helper was both polite and honest, but had no answer as to why the app was not reading the digital code. She was advised to seek out one of the 80 designated EU settlement scheme scanning offices (in council offices and town hall register offices) where the passport could be scanned manually. It took weeks for Ratnam to get an appointment at Ealing town hall, but she finally went on 4 July, consulting a photocopied map to find room 1.13, winding right, then left along echoing corridors, then right, then left again, up some marble steps, past a bust of Chopin through the beautiful, almost empty mock-gothic building, soon to be decommissioned and turned into a boutique hotel. Once we arrived at a small, pink-doored room, the official inside was unable to help, also attempting to swipe the passport on a phone until the system locked her out, too. So Ratnam then sat in the waiting room on the phone to the resolution centre in Liverpool for another 40 minutes , asking for help. \u201cI can only advise that the application is locked for 24 hours. We can\u2019t override that,\u201d an official said. \u201cFor the time being there is nothing further we can do to help.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m just fed up,\u201d Ratnam said, a red flush of worry creeping up her neck. \u201cI\u2019m getting worked up; I can\u2019t even get my words out. I don\u2019t want to keep trying.\u201d She organised a second appointment at the town hall on 10 July. The passport was finally scanned, quite easily, that day, but two days later she received an email asking her to upload an image of her old passport showing a historic stamp giving her indefinite leave to remain. The same email told her that the Home Office could find no record of her indefinite leave to remain and wanted to \u201cconfirm that you are related to your EU family member as claimed\u201d. The email was a mistake. She couldn\u2019t work out how to upload the passport; there was another long phone call to Liverpool on 15 July, after which she managed to send off the picture. \u201cI can hear it in your voice, how anxious you are,\u201d a call handler told her. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you just check my HMRC records?\u201d Ratnam asked. \u201cI\u2019ve been paying tax for long enough.\u201d On 16 July, an email arrived telling her that her documents had been sent in an \u201cunsupported format and we have been unable to attach the files to your application\u201d. But puzzlingly, a minute later, a second email arrived, saying that her \u201capplication to the EU Settlement Scheme has been successful\u201d. Ratnam has managed to secure her status. Nothing catastrophic went wrong with her application \u2013 just a series of irritations that sucked up her time and lowered her mood. Similar irritations will be felt by tens of thousands of others going through the process, reinforcing a sense of alienation. \u201cI\u2019m annoyed that I had to do it after 50 years here. There were mistakes and it was stressful. I don\u2019t feel welcome having to go through a process like that. [See Footnote]. Campaigners worry most about those who do not realise they need to apply, or those who have difficulties converting their pre-settled status into the permanent settled status in the years that follow Brexit. Nicolas Hatton of the 3million charity warns: \u201cOn 1 January 2021, if there is no deal, and you haven\u2019t applied, you will be an illegal immigrant. The hostile environment is no joke. That\u2019s when the timebomb will explode.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 8 October 2019 to clarify that most but not all EU nationals resident in the UK must have applied for settled status if they want to continue living and working here.

My parents would tell me how she had founded the Caribbean carnival, the precursor to Notting Hill carnival.</p> \n<p>But that was not the important thing for me. Instead, it was that, throughout her political activism, first as a black feminist leader in the Communist party in the US in the 1940s and then as a communist activist in Britain after being deported in 1955, she always spoke fearlessly about the women\u2019s struggle.</p> \n<p>She really made the connections between race, gender and class \u2013 she was intersectional before that was really understood as a term. She was in a party dominated by men, and she was front and centre arguing about the need not only for working-class representation, but also for women\u2019s inclusion and for people of colour.</p> \n<p>The other thing that resonates is that she was born in the Caribbean and then went to the US before coming to Britain, and so her life represents the African diaspora. She arrived in Britain at the height of Windrush racism in the mid-50s and fought to oppose the restrictions on Commonwealth citizens coming to Britain. The fact that Commonwealth people who have spent most of their lives in Britain are still being deported today, as in the Windrush scandal, is something that she would have been disgusted by.

Being aware of your traditions and heritage is really important. It\u2019s not witchcraft \u2013 it\u2019s about connecting with African roots and keeping that alive. Kehinde Andrews is a professor of black studies at Birmingham University Claudia Jones by Valerie Amos I grew up hearing a lot about Claudia Jones, who died in 1964 when I was 10. My parents would tell me how she had founded the Caribbean carnival, the precursor to Notting Hill carnival. But that was not the important thing for me. Instead, it was that, throughout her political activism, first as a black feminist leader in the Communist party in the US in the 1940s and then as a communist activist in Britain after being deported in 1955, she always spoke fearlessly about the women\u2019s struggle. She really made the connections between race, gender and class \u2013 she was intersectional before that was really understood as a term. She was in a party dominated by men, and she was front and centre arguing about the need not only for working-class representation, but also for women\u2019s inclusion and for people of colour. The other thing that resonates is that she was born in the Caribbean and then went to the US before coming to Britain, and so her life represents the African diaspora. She arrived in Britain at the height of Windrush racism in the mid-50s and fought to oppose the restrictions on Commonwealth citizens coming to Britain. The fact that Commonwealth people who have spent most of their lives in Britain are still being deported today, as in the Windrush scandal, is something that she would have been disgusted by. Hers is a legacy we must remember and continue to emulate. Valerie Amos is the director of Soas University of London George Washington Carver by Jak Beula George Washington Carver was an inventor and agricultural scientist whose work in the early 20th century ultimately gave us peanut butter as well as 300 other products derived from peanuts, including soaps, flour and insulation. He gave it all away, dedicating his patents to the American people. He is no different to other achievers of African American descent who have not been given their due space and place in history. I was contacted in 2004 by English Heritage; it had only 15 plaques to people of colour in England. That is why we started the blue plaque campaign to have people of black descent recognised. In the years since, we have put up more than 50, as well as two statues \u2013 one of which is a memorial in Windrush Square in Brixton to the African-Caribbean soldiers who fought in the first and second world wars. When you memorialise historic locations, and people such as Carver, you celebrate our common heritage. People should be more aware of who we live among and our shared histories. Jak Beula is the founder of the Nubian Jak Community Trust Alice Kinloch by Hakim Adi Alice Kinloch was a South African activist who came to Britain in the late 1890s and helped to found the African Association, although that is usually credited to a man, Henry Sylvester-Williams. The African Association convened the First Pan-African Conference, which was held in London in 1900. This was the first major event to use the term pan-African and to gather people from all over the diaspora to speak with one voice. Kinloch has been written out of history, and not much is known about her \u2013 I have never even seen a picture of her \u2013 but she played a leading role at a time when few African women were active in politics in Britain or elsewhere. Hakim Adi is a professor of the history of Africa and the African diaspora at the University of Chichester George William Gordon by Priyamvada Gopal George William Gordon was hanged after the Morant Bay rebellion of 1865, when hundreds of Jamaicans protested against the abject poverty of colonial rule. A mixed-race Jamaican and a British subject, Gordon was accused of having planned the rebellion, although his only \u201ccrime\u201d was to speak out against planter rule and colonial misgovernance. His swift hanging caused a huge controversy in Britain. He became a martyr around whom there emerged the first rumblings of solidarity across race lines. There were working-class meetings around the country to commemorate his death and to organise protests. People even held mock funerals for him and argued that although he was a different colour, he was still an Englishman, and that anyone could become a target of the empire. Priyamvada Gopal is a reader in Anglophone and related literature at the University of Cambridge",

      "body": "<p>In today\u2019s daring TV landscape, a white, cisgender, egregiously wealthy gay man hardly counts as an advancement for queer representation. I know this. You know this. Networks and streaming services know this.</p> <p> </p> <p>That\u2019s because recent LGBTQ representation on TV has been wide-ranging. There\u2019s the myriad of black identities on Pose, the confident trans character of Jules on Euphoria, and the sexually fluid cast of MTV\u2019s dating reality show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/10/are-you-the-one-sexually-fluid-mtv\">Are You The One?</a><em> </em>According to Gladd\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.glaad.org/blog/glaads-where-we-are-tv-report-shows-television-telling-more-lgbtq-stories-ever\">annual survey of LGBT representation on TV</a>, last year was the first time ever LGBTQ characters of color outnumbered LGBTQ white characters.</p> <p>Basically, if you are a white gay man on TV, you better be bringing something fresh to the table.</p> <p>Enter Payton Hobart. The Politician \u2013 the first show to come out of Ryan Murphy\u2019s $300m deal with Netflix \u2013 deftly employs the power-hungry character\u2019s privilege and whiteness. Rich, overconfident, entitled. Payton is something queer people on TV are so rarely allowed to be: awful.</p> <p>The aversion to thorny gay characters can be seen as an overcorrection \u2013 for so long they were the villains and predators, never the heroes. However, it is important we don\u2019t turn them into cookie-cutter archetypes either.</p> <p>Payton (Ben Platt) spends the course of the show unapologetically focused on getting what he wants from the world, at any cost. As he campaigns to become his high school\u2019s president (Murphy somehow makes the stakes feel higher than the Florida recount), Payton makes selfish decision after selfish decision. He only picks a student with cancer as his running mate to gain sympathy votes. He cleverly ousts his brothers from the family will. And when Payton\u2019s lover/opponent \u2013 a dreamy, statuesque boy with the totally crush-worthy name River \u2013 dies by suicide, Payton sheds no tears.

      "bodyText": "In today\u2019s daring TV landscape, a white, cisgender, egregiously wealthy gay man hardly counts as an advancement for queer representation. I know this. You know this. Networks and streaming services know this. That\u2019s because recent LGBTQ representation on TV has been wide-ranging. There\u2019s the myriad of black identities on Pose, the confident trans character of Jules on Euphoria, and the sexually fluid cast of MTV\u2019s dating reality show Are You The One? According to Gladd\u2019s annual survey of LGBT representation on TV, last year was the first time ever LGBTQ characters of color outnumbered LGBTQ white characters. Basically, if you are a white gay man on TV, you better be bringing something fresh to the table. Enter Payton Hobart. The Politician \u2013 the first show to come out of Ryan Murphy\u2019s $300m deal with Netflix \u2013 deftly employs the power-hungry character\u2019s privilege and whiteness. Rich, overconfident, entitled. Payton is something queer people on TV are so rarely allowed to be: awful. The aversion to thorny gay characters can be seen as an overcorrection \u2013 for so long they were the villains and predators, never the heroes. However, it is important we don\u2019t turn them into cookie-cutter archetypes either. Payton (Ben Platt) spends the course of the show unapologetically focused on getting what he wants from the world, at any cost. As he campaigns to become his high school\u2019s president (Murphy somehow makes the stakes feel higher than the Florida recount), Payton makes selfish decision after selfish decision. He only picks a student with cancer as his running mate to gain sympathy votes. He cleverly ousts his brothers from the family will. And when Payton\u2019s lover/opponent \u2013 a dreamy, statuesque boy with the totally crush-worthy name River \u2013 dies by suicide, Payton sheds no tears. Instead, he holds a meeting with his campaign team about gaining a clear path to victory. Critics have slammed The Politician for being \u201cempty\u201d and a \u201cmess\u201d. However, it feels like Ryan Murphy has delivered a show deliberately as imperfect as its character. Payton is the queer anti-hero we\u2019ve needed.

      "body": "<p>While the digital natives of Generation Z and ageing seniors inhabit different worlds, the two groups have something urgent in common: loneliness.</p> <p>Last year, a national <a href=\"https://www.multivu.com/players/English/8294451-cigna-us-loneliness-survey/\">survey</a> on loneliness in the US found that Americans are lonelier than ever. Nearly half of those polled in the Cigna survey reported sometimes or always feeling alone and only 53% said they had meaningful, in-person social interactions on a daily basis. But the feelings of isolation are most acute among adults ages 18 to 22. Members of generation Z were significantly more likely than any other age group to say they felt isolated.</p> <p>Research has long documented high rates of loneliness among seniors too. One in three adults over the age of 45 are lonely, an AARP Foundation <a href=\"https://www.aarp.org/content/dam/aarp/research/surveys_statistics/life-leisure/2018/loneliness-social-connections-2018.doi.10.26419-2Fres.00246.001.pdf\">survey</a> found. </p> <p>One Silicon Valley startup is betting on an unlikely combination \u2013 college students, seniors and technology \u2013 to combat these trends.

In more than 150 interviews, family members caring for ageing parents repeatedly said they felt intense guilt for not being able to meet their parents\u2019 emotional needs. Zhang and Dangerfield-Cha saw an opportunity to tap college students \u2013 often yearning for connection themselves during a transitional life \u2013 to fill this gap in care for the older generation.</p> <p>Today, more than 500 Bay Area college students have become \u201cconnective tissue\u201d for more than 250 seniors through Mon Ami, Dangerfield-Cha said.</p> <p>The relationships are facilitated by the app, through which students can search for seniors in need in their area (not unlike gig work), schedule visits and message with the seniors\u2019 family members. They log a report every visit, complete with a selfie. The report triggers a PayPal payment for the students, who receive $20 per hour of the $25 hourly rate families pay.</p> <p>The Guardian spoke with three pairs of Mon Ami students and seniors to ask how these meetings are making life less lonely for both groups in the 21st century.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018</strong>Instead of just existing, you\u2019re living<strong>\u2019</strong></h2> <p><strong>Ted Bunding, 76, and Tanya Tannous, 21</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d4473826fc673472c50a19add3d8aa75c0495be8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d4473826fc673472c50a19add3d8aa75c0495be8/0_0_3600_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bunding and Tannous often build and fly paper airplanes during their time together.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bunding and Tannous often build and fly paper airplanes during their time together.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim McAuley/Jim McAuley for The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ted Bunding needs help getting in and out of his wheelchair.

Tannous, now a senior majoring in molecular biology, was obsessed with cars as a young girl. When they\u2019re not testing out flight variables for paper airplanes, they\u2019re deep in the pages of Engineering the Pyramids and JRR Tolkien books.</p> <p>\u201cWhen they\u2019re together, he wakes up,\u201d said Liz Erlich, Bunding\u2019s younger sister and primary caretaker. \u201cThey can communicate.

After they spend time together, his mood is lighter and he\u2019s more engaged, his sister said.</p> <p>The students are not meant to provide professional care, but rather companionship. The Mon Ami founders drew on research that has shown the health benefits of social interaction for seniors, from combating cognitive decline to reducing the use of pharmacological interventions in people with dementia. (On the flip side, loneliness has been linked to cardiovascular disease, dementia, obesity, depression and anxiety.)</p> <p>\u201cTo have this aspect of taking care of someone \u2013 to think about somebody\u2019s emotional and mental life \u2013 I\u2019m very glad they came up with this idea,\u201d Erlich said. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be one or the other. It\u2019s both.\u201d</p> <p>This emotional uplifting is even more critical for seniors in assisted living centers, Erlich said, where \u201cwhat\u2019s easiest\u201d is often \u201cto get somebody dressed, put them in a wheelchair and stick them in the corner.</p> <p>With the kind of engagement Tannous provides, \u201cinstead of just existing, you\u2019re living\u201d, Erlich said.</p> <p>Tannous, whose grandfather also has Parkinson\u2019s, joined Mon Ami last year after her roommate worked as a companion. She\u2019s become a consistent part of Bunding\u2019s life.

But in a fifth-floor apartment in Russian Hill on a recent afternoon, two found common ground.</p> <p>Jacob Choi, a 29-year-old educational technology startup founder, was helping Sandra Church, an 82-year-old former Broadway actor born in San Francisco, draft itineraries and send emails for her coming two-and-a-half month trip to Europe. Choi, a Mon Ami companion, comes over once or twice a month for six hours, usually on a Sunday, to help Church with odd jobs around her home.</p> <p>While she describes herself as a young octogenarian \u2013 mobile and independent but living alone in the elegant, art-filled apartment \u2013 Choi\u2019s visits are a \u201cgodsend\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI just can\u2019t do all this stuff any more by myself,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen it gets [to the point that] I can\u2019t handle it, I\u2019m just a nervous wreck.\u201d</p> <p>Choi, who graduated from the Stanford School of Business last year, does a little bit of everything for Church.

They talk politics, art, history and films. A frequent topic is the role tech has played in changing San Francisco. (Church has been both fascinated and horrified to learn about automation and job displacement from Choi.)</p> <p>\u201cOne of the things that we talk about a lot is how the infiltration of tech companies is ruining the culture of San Francisco, especially for people who have been here for a really long time,\u201d Choi said.

      "bodyText": "While the digital natives of Generation Z and ageing seniors inhabit different worlds, the two groups have something urgent in common: loneliness. Last year, a national survey on loneliness in the US found that Americans are lonelier than ever. Nearly half of those polled in the Cigna survey reported sometimes or always feeling alone and only 53% said they had meaningful, in-person social interactions on a daily basis. But the feelings of isolation are most acute among adults ages 18 to 22. Members of generation Z were significantly more likely than any other age group to say they felt isolated. Research has long documented high rates of loneliness among seniors too. One in three adults over the age of 45 are lonely, an AARP Foundation survey found. One Silicon Valley startup is betting on an unlikely combination \u2013 college students, seniors and technology \u2013 to combat these trends. Using an app, Mon Ami pairs California\u2019s Bay Area students with elderly people to support their emotional wellbeing. Joy Zhang, who had a background in healthcare, and Madeline Dangerfield-Cha, who had worked in education and digital marketing, started Mon Ami while at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business. In more than 150 interviews, family members caring for ageing parents repeatedly said they felt intense guilt for not being able to meet their parents\u2019 emotional needs. Zhang and Dangerfield-Cha saw an opportunity to tap college students \u2013 often yearning for connection themselves during a transitional life \u2013 to fill this gap in care for the older generation. Today, more than 500 Bay Area college students have become \u201cconnective tissue\u201d for more than 250 seniors through Mon Ami, Dangerfield-Cha said. The relationships are facilitated by the app, through which students can search for seniors in need in their area (not unlike gig work), schedule visits and message with the seniors\u2019 family members. They log a report every visit, complete with a selfie. The report triggers a PayPal payment for the students, who receive $20 per hour of the $25 hourly rate families pay. The Guardian spoke with three pairs of Mon Ami students and seniors to ask how these meetings are making life less lonely for both groups in the 21st century. \u2018Instead of just existing, you\u2019re living\u2019 Ted Bunding, 76, and Tanya Tannous, 21 Ted Bunding needs help getting in and out of his wheelchair. He struggles to speak clearly and recall questions he\u2019s been asked, and he sometimes thinks he\u2019s grasped hold of something, like a fork full of food, when he hasn\u2019t. Bunding, 76, has lived with Parkinson\u2019s disease for two decades. He\u2019s also an engineering buff whose eyes light up when Tanya Tannous, a University of California, Berkeley, student and Mon Ami \u201ccompanion\u201d, visits him once a week to fly paper airplanes together. Tannous and Bunding assumed their pre-takeoff positions in the outdoor courtyard of an Oakland senior living facility, Bunding\u2019s hovering hand in the air, ready to thrust his paper airplane into the slight summer breeze. \u201cThe wind is in our favor today,\u201d Tannous said. He nodded, slightly, his movements slowed by the Parkinson\u2019s. The two are separated by five decades but have bonded over a mutual admiration for \u201chow things work\u201d, as Bunding put it. Bunding is a former car mechanic who repaired computers at the Stanford campus bookstore for years and listens religiously to NPR\u2019s Car Talk. Tannous, now a senior majoring in molecular biology, was obsessed with cars as a young girl. When they\u2019re not testing out flight variables for paper airplanes, they\u2019re deep in the pages of Engineering the Pyramids and JRR Tolkien books. \u201cWhen they\u2019re together, he wakes up,\u201d said Liz Erlich, Bunding\u2019s younger sister and primary caretaker. \u201cThey can communicate. Because Ted has difficulty talking, a lot of people don\u2019t understand him and they turn away. But if you spend a little bit of time and a little bit of effort, you begin to hear him.\u201d Bunding was one of Mon Ami\u2019s earliest clients. Stanford students visited him and his partner at their Menlo Park home. But as his Parkinson\u2019s and his partner\u2019s dementia advanced, their families decided they both would need more intensive care and moved them into separate facilities. While Erlich\u2019s daily visits are mostly focused on her brother\u2019s medical care or chores, Tannous is there solely to spend time with him. After they spend time together, his mood is lighter and he\u2019s more engaged, his sister said. The students are not meant to provide professional care, but rather companionship. The Mon Ami founders drew on research that has shown the health benefits of social interaction for seniors, from combating cognitive decline to reducing the use of pharmacological interventions in people with dementia. (On the flip side, loneliness has been linked to cardiovascular disease, dementia, obesity, depression and anxiety.) \u201cTo have this aspect of taking care of someone \u2013 to think about somebody\u2019s emotional and mental life \u2013 I\u2019m very glad they came up with this idea,\u201d Erlich said. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be one or the other. It\u2019s both.\u201d This emotional uplifting is even more critical for seniors in assisted living centers, Erlich said, where \u201cwhat\u2019s easiest\u201d is often \u201cto get somebody dressed, put them in a wheelchair and stick them in the corner. With the kind of engagement Tannous provides, \u201cinstead of just existing, you\u2019re living\u201d, Erlich said. Tannous, whose grandfather also has Parkinson\u2019s, joined Mon Ami last year after her roommate worked as a companion. She\u2019s become a consistent part of Bunding\u2019s life. She can intuit what he\u2019s saying even when his speech is difficult to understand \u2013 including jokes that someone who hadn\u2019t invested that time or overlooked him because of his condition might miss entirely. A scientist at heart, like Bunding, she quotes Isaac Newton to explain what she enjoys most about the experience: \u201cIf I have seen further, it is by standing upon the shoulders of giants.\u201d \u201cAs young people I think we forget sometimes that there are people that have preceded us and make us who we are,\u201d Tannous said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to connect with generations above us and below us.\u201d \u2018We talk about tech companies ruining San Francisco\u2019 Sandra Church, 82, and Jacob Choi, 29 Young techies and older San Franciscans are often at odds with one another. But in a fifth-floor apartment in Russian Hill on a recent afternoon, two found common ground. Jacob Choi, a 29-year-old educational technology startup founder, was helping Sandra Church, an 82-year-old former Broadway actor born in San Francisco, draft itineraries and send emails for her coming two-and-a-half month trip to Europe. Choi, a Mon Ami companion, comes over once or twice a month for six hours, usually on a Sunday, to help Church with odd jobs around her home. While she describes herself as a young octogenarian \u2013 mobile and independent but living alone in the elegant, art-filled apartment \u2013 Choi\u2019s visits are a \u201cgodsend\u201d. \u201cI just can\u2019t do all this stuff any more by myself,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen it gets [to the point that] I can\u2019t handle it, I\u2019m just a nervous wreck.\u201d Choi, who graduated from the Stanford School of Business last year, does a little bit of everything for Church. He\u2019s created a filing system to organize decades of her handwritten journals, set up her Sonos sound system, reprogrammed an all-in-one remote, fixed stuck doorknobs and hung her canvas paintings in a back hallway. Church \u2013 warm and energetic with a dry sense of humor, peppered with profanities \u2013 insists she wasn\u2019t seeking companionship through Mon Ami. \u201cI\u2019m a loner,\u201d she said. But the two have an almost familial rapport. They talk politics, art, history and films. A frequent topic is the role tech has played in changing San Francisco. (Church has been both fascinated and horrified to learn about automation and job displacement from Choi.) \u201cOne of the things that we talk about a lot is how the infiltration of tech companies is ruining the culture of San Francisco, especially for people who have been here for a really long time,\u201d Choi said. He sees Mon Ami as a \u201cgood opportunity to use technology \u2013 it\u2019s an app [and] it\u2019s kind of gig work as well \u2013 to give back.\u201d Choi visits regularly with one other Mon Ami senior, a Japanese American woman with severe Alzheimer\u2019s. They often visit the de Young Museum and go on walks in Golden Gate Park. The time he spends with these women \u2013 off his phone and in conversation with people from another generation \u2013 is precious to him as well. \u201cThis is kind of my escape from my normal job, to be honest,\u201d he said. \u201cSandra\u2019s not on her iPhone checking her Instagram, you know?\u201d \u2018Because I\u2019m not from here, they\u2019re helping me\u2019 Carlos Watson, 85, and Marck Rakotoson, 21 At one Silicon Valley senior living facility, Mon Ami students pull hard-to-reach residents back into life. Earlier this year, staff at the BridgePoint at Los Altos partnered with the company to work with seniors who tend to stay in their rooms and aren\u2019t receptive to the staff\u2019s efforts to engage them. One such resident is Carlos Watson. The 85-year-old native of Jamaica, Vietnam veteran and former professor is endlessly talkative but spends a lot of time in his room. But on a recent weekend morning, he talked animatedly with Marck Rakotoson, a De Anza College student from Madagascar.

      "body": "<p>\u201cSpaff some money on some geeks.\u201d According to <a href=\"https://members.tortoisemedia.com/2019/05/19/brexit-part-4/content.html\" title=\"\">Chris Cook\u2019s excellent account</a> of Theresa May\u2019s Brexit negotiations with Brussels, that was the instruction issued to the civil service by May\u2019s enforcer Fiona Hill in late 2016.</p> <p>It had finally dawned on the British government that it had committed itself to two incompatible things. One was that under no circumstances would there be a return to a hard border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. The other was that all of the UK was going to leave the EU\u2019s customs union. May faced exactly the same problem that her successor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/06/macron-gives-boris-johnson-end-week-overhaul-brexit-plan\" title=\"\">Boris Johnson is </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/06/macron-gives-boris-johnson-end-week-overhaul-brexit-plan\" title=\"\">struggling with</a>: you can do one or other of these things but you cannot do both. If Northern Ireland leaves the customs union, there will be border controls.</p> <p>And so May tried to do what Johnson is still proposing: throw money at nerds and hope that they can somehow transform a political problem into a technical issue. The old (superbly condescending) joke was that whenever the Irish question was about to be solved, the Irish would change the question. But the British government has been trying to solve the riddle of Brexit\u2019s Irish question not just by changing the question, but by changing the entire conceptual framework. It has to be removed from a discourse of history and geography and memory and translated into the languages of technology and managerialism.</p> <p>That is how Johnson sought to define the problem in his speech to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2019/oct/02/boris-johnsons-speech-to-the-tory-party-conference-annotated\" title=\"\">Tory </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2019/oct/02/boris-johnsons-speech-to-the-tory-party-conference-annotated\" title=\"\">party conference last week</a>: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/uk/brexit-johnson-says-uk-wants-no-checks-at-or-near-irish-border-1.4037506\" title=\"\">Essentially a technical discussion of the exact nature of future customs checks</a>.\u201d Previously, of course, he suggested that crossing the Irish border was similar to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/feb/27/boris-johnson-shares-his-inspired-solution-to-the-irish-border-question\" title=\"\">going from one </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/feb/27/boris-johnson-shares-his-inspired-solution-to-the-irish-border-question\" title=\"\">borough of London</a> to another, and that any problem it creates could be solved with the same technology used to operate the city\u2019s congestion charge.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Nobody really believes that what Brexit does to John Bull\u2019s Other Island is a matter for a \u2018technical discussion'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is a way of minimising and dismissing an inconvenient truth. But it also goes to the heart of the complete failure of Johnson\u2019s proposals for a replacement of the backstop designed to keep the border invisible. Everybody in Ireland, north and south, knows that there are many technical questions thrown up by Brexit. But nobody \u2013 not even Johnson\u2019s DUP allies \u2013 really believes that what Brexit does to John Bull\u2019s Other Island is a matter for a \u201ctechnical discussion\u201d. In Ireland, it\u2019s about lives \u2013 and deaths.</p> <p>Writing about music is said to be like dancing about architecture. Using the language of technology to address the questions of history and belonging on the island of Ireland is geeking about memory \u2013 like trying to make an algorithm for grief. It\u2019s a category error that shunts the problem not just into \u201calternative arrangements\u201d but into a parallel universe.</p> <p>The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, gets this. When she visited Ireland last April and spent time talking to people who live and work on both sides of the border, she said simply that she understood what they were saying because: \u201cFor 34 years I lived behind the iron curtain so I know only too well what it means once borders vanish, once walls fall.\u201d She grasps the truth that what is at stake is not \u201cthe exact nature of future customs checks\u201d \u2013 it is that customs checks (which the British government pledged never to reinstitute but now proposes to make necessary) are the outward bureaucratic signs of an inner anguish: the rebuilding of spiritual and psychological walls that have been demolished since 1998.</p> <p>Two particular ironies attach to Johnson\u2019s privileging of a technocratic discourse over real human experience. One is that the Brexit project is in every other respect famously contemptuous of \u201cgeeks\u201d. The British people, in Michael Gove\u2019s analysis, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/09/michael-gove-experts-academics-vote\" title=\"\">have had enough of experts</a>\u201d. But the Irish, apparently, are expected to place all their trust in the experts, nerds and boffins who will come up with magical technologies to create what does not yet exist anywhere on Earth: a frontier between two different customs regimes across which goods move with no controls and no physical infrastructure.</p> <p>The other irony is that Brexit itself is predicated on the idea that a technocratic discourse is entirely inadequate to the task of understanding how people feel about who they are and where they belong. Its bogeymen are faceless bureaucrats in Brussels who can never appreciate the importance of identity and history to the English. Yet the Irish are invited by the very same people to forget history and identity, to just lie back and think of \u201cmaximum facilitation\u201d.</p> <p>Brexiters\u2019 technofreak obsessions cannot even begin to engage with the memories and anxieties and aspirations that are at the heart of Irish concerns about the collateral damage of the English nationalist project. The disjunction goes so deep that it even involves two different conceptions of time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/07/no-10-blames-eu-johnson-brexit-plan-fails-to-make-progress\">No 10 blames EU as Johnson's Brexit plan fails to make progress</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While Irish people are painfully aware of the past \u2013 the deep history that led to the creation of the border and the living memory of the Troubles \u2013 the Brexiters act like dedicated futurists. When Johnson told his party, in relation to the border, that \u201ctechnology is improving the whole time\u201d, he was repeating the sci-fi utopianism that has been central to the Brexit faith: the technology to ensure a frictionless border does not yet exist, but in these days of miracles and wonder it is just over the horizon. The actual \u201csolutions\u201d may be less Silicon Valley, more the IT Crowd, but tomorrow\u2019s world is almost upon us.</p> <p>Until they give up this technological illusion and engage with living history, there is no chance of Johnson and his allies coming up with serious proposals. But why should they do that? The great utility of their discourse lies in its distancing effects. The politicians and special advisers only have to spaff the cash \u2013 the geeks can find the answers. Technology \u2013 that abstract, shifting, supposedly value-free force \u2013 removes the burden of public duty. And the beauty of these machines and systems is that they have no memory, no fears, no hopes and, if it all goes wrong, no possibility of blood on their hands.</p> <p>\u2022 Fintan O\u2019Toole is a columnist with the Irish Times and author of Heroic Failure: Brexit and the Politics of Pain</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 8 October 2019 to remove text that was inconsistent with the Guardian\u2019s style guidelines.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u201cSpaff some money on some geeks.\u201d According to Chris Cook\u2019s excellent account of Theresa May\u2019s Brexit negotiations with Brussels, that was the instruction issued to the civil service by May\u2019s enforcer Fiona Hill in late 2016. It had finally dawned on the British government that it had committed itself to two incompatible things. One was that under no circumstances would there be a return to a hard border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. The other was that all of the UK was going to leave the EU\u2019s customs union. May faced exactly the same problem that her successor Boris Johnson is struggling with: you can do one or other of these things but you cannot do both. If Northern Ireland leaves the customs union, there will be border controls. And so May tried to do what Johnson is still proposing: throw money at nerds and hope that they can somehow transform a political problem into a technical issue. The old (superbly condescending) joke was that whenever the Irish question was about to be solved, the Irish would change the question. But the British government has been trying to solve the riddle of Brexit\u2019s Irish question not just by changing the question, but by changing the entire conceptual framework. It has to be removed from a discourse of history and geography and memory and translated into the languages of technology and managerialism. That is how Johnson sought to define the problem in his speech to the Tory party conference last week: \u201cEssentially a technical discussion of the exact nature of future customs checks.\u201d Previously, of course, he suggested that crossing the Irish border was similar to going from one borough of London to another, and that any problem it creates could be solved with the same technology used to operate the city\u2019s congestion charge. This is a way of minimising and dismissing an inconvenient truth. But it also goes to the heart of the complete failure of Johnson\u2019s proposals for a replacement of the backstop designed to keep the border invisible. Everybody in Ireland, north and south, knows that there are many technical questions thrown up by Brexit. But nobody \u2013 not even Johnson\u2019s DUP allies \u2013 really believes that what Brexit does to John Bull\u2019s Other Island is a matter for a \u201ctechnical discussion\u201d. In Ireland, it\u2019s about lives \u2013 and deaths. Writing about music is said to be like dancing about architecture. Using the language of technology to address the questions of history and belonging on the island of Ireland is geeking about memory \u2013 like trying to make an algorithm for grief. It\u2019s a category error that shunts the problem not just into \u201calternative arrangements\u201d but into a parallel universe. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, gets this. When she visited Ireland last April and spent time talking to people who live and work on both sides of the border, she said simply that she understood what they were saying because: \u201cFor 34 years I lived behind the iron curtain so I know only too well what it means once borders vanish, once walls fall.\u201d She grasps the truth that what is at stake is not \u201cthe exact nature of future customs checks\u201d \u2013 it is that customs checks (which the British government pledged never to reinstitute but now proposes to make necessary) are the outward bureaucratic signs of an inner anguish: the rebuilding of spiritual and psychological walls that have been demolished since 1998. Two particular ironies attach to Johnson\u2019s privileging of a technocratic discourse over real human experience. One is that the Brexit project is in every other respect famously contemptuous of \u201cgeeks\u201d. The British people, in Michael Gove\u2019s analysis, \u201chave had enough of experts\u201d. But the Irish, apparently, are expected to place all their trust in the experts, nerds and boffins who will come up with magical technologies to create what does not yet exist anywhere on Earth: a frontier between two different customs regimes across which goods move with no controls and no physical infrastructure. The other irony is that Brexit itself is predicated on the idea that a technocratic discourse is entirely inadequate to the task of understanding how people feel about who they are and where they belong. Its bogeymen are faceless bureaucrats in Brussels who can never appreciate the importance of identity and history to the English. Yet the Irish are invited by the very same people to forget history and identity, to just lie back and think of \u201cmaximum facilitation\u201d. Brexiters\u2019 technofreak obsessions cannot even begin to engage with the memories and anxieties and aspirations that are at the heart of Irish concerns about the collateral damage of the English nationalist project. The disjunction goes so deep that it even involves two different conceptions of time. While Irish people are painfully aware of the past \u2013 the deep history that led to the creation of the border and the living memory of the Troubles \u2013 the Brexiters act like dedicated futurists. When Johnson told his party, in relation to the border, that \u201ctechnology is improving the whole time\u201d, he was repeating the sci-fi utopianism that has been central to the Brexit faith: the technology to ensure a frictionless border does not yet exist, but in these days of miracles and wonder it is just over the horizon. The actual \u201csolutions\u201d may be less Silicon Valley, more the IT Crowd, but tomorrow\u2019s world is almost upon us. Until they give up this technological illusion and engage with living history, there is no chance of Johnson and his allies coming up with serious proposals. But why should they do that? The great utility of their discourse lies in its distancing effects. The politicians and special advisers only have to spaff the cash \u2013 the geeks can find the answers. Technology \u2013 that abstract, shifting, supposedly value-free force \u2013 removes the burden of public duty. And the beauty of these machines and systems is that they have no memory, no fears, no hopes and, if it all goes wrong, no possibility of blood on their hands. \u2022 Fintan O\u2019Toole is a columnist with the Irish Times and author of Heroic Failure: Brexit and the Politics of Pain \u2022 This article was amended on 8 October 2019 to remove text that was inconsistent with the Guardian\u2019s style guidelines.",

      "bodyText": "Four months have passed since Narendra Modi and the BJP came back to power in India, and more seems to have happened there than in the last 40 years. The sense of severance that many experience today, of being divorced from the workings of the nation, exceeds even the helplessness felt during the suspension of civil liberties in the emergency of 1975 to 1977 and the political traumas that followed. This is because \u2013 without the matter being explicitly articulated \u2013 citizen has been set against citizen: not just Muslim against Hindu or, say, Kashmiris against the rest of India, but those who subscribe to the BJP\u2019s new conception of the nation against those who do not, leaving one without trust in the other. How to judge these past four months? A series of disruptions has dwarfed the now distant seeming upset of Modi\u2019s economically disastrous demonetisation programme of 2016. In August there was the abrogation of article 370 of the Indian constitution, which granted \u201cspecial status\u201d to Kashmir in acknowledgment of its contested history. This was followed immediately by the \u201chouse arrest\u201d of elected Kashmiri leaders and the imprisonment of thousands of others. What we saw was the attempt to take a difficult and divisive issue and simply place it to one side by an act of will, so that it requires no further discussion. There is the impression that not just the Kashmiris\u2019 but all our fates are now being decided for us. The home minister, Amit Shah, would have us believe that the \u201crestrictions\u2019\u201d in Kashmir are all in the mind. I asked a Kashmiri how she interpreted this. She speculated that what was being implied was that the lack of protest in Kashmir was equal to normalcy. But a lack of protest in a democratic country is strange, and a sustained lack of protest alarming. Is this the normalcy that Indians wish to be bestowed on them by their government? Then there is spectacle of a different sort: of the government borrowing an unprecedented sum of money from the Reserve Bank of India; of it failing to pay the Central Reserve Police Force; of the economy tanking, of Modi pronouncing that India is in the ascendant. We live simultaneously in disparate realities: a \u201cnormal\u201d Kashmir, an abnormal country; a bankrupt economy; a rising India \u2013 competing scripts, none of which acknowledge the existence of the other, as distant as countryman has grown to countryman. If asked what this government\u2019s one great recent achievement is, some people might draw attention to the number of toilets built in a country with poor sanitation. Others, whose experience of the new India is different, would say that its greatest success has been in creating a climate of fear. As a consequence, dissent has a purer form now. It\u2019s no longer, as it was once, preaching to the converted. It\u2019s not even the pointing out of unpleasant facts. It\u2019s simply a demonstration that dissent continues to be possible. India has not, outside of Indira Gandhi\u2019s declaration of emergency, been in this place before, and certainly not with the degree of popular support we see now, which can only be characterised as a form of inebriation. The judiciary, the police and other law enforcement agencies are all seen, rightly or wrongly, to \u201cbelong\u201d to the government, and many high-profile lawbreakers seem to be those who, coincidentally, disagree with the BJP.

In response to a petition in Muzzafurpur, Bihar, a court has now asked the police to open a case against us. Then there\u2019s the National Register of Citizens (NRC), a central government-backed project in the state of Assam aimed at uncovering and expelling \u201cforeigners\u201d (that is, Muslim refugees from Bangladesh who don\u2019t have the relevant documents, though the reality has turned out to be far messier, and the majority of those now deemed \u201cforeigners\u201d have turned out to be Hindus). Many are threatened with being uprooted, and others in the region are being asked to help uproot their neighbours. These extraordinary developments got me thinking about ethnicity and citizenship. About the trajectory of Indians in the 20th century: of Gandhi\u2019s relocation to England and then to South Africa, where, made conscious of his race and colour, he first moved towards politics; of Sikhs settling en masse in Canada after murderous violence against them in 1984; of Bengalis departing a declining Kolkata in the 70s. Indians are a many-sided people: they are entrepreneurial, curious, cultured, open-minded, adventurous. They have great writers, scientists, businessmen; they have Gandhi. They\u2019re also great migrants: they\u2019ve gone to and worked and settled in every part of the world. They know the pain of discrimination and upheaval intimately.

      "bodyText": "Sir Lynton Crosby\u2019s CTF Partners is under investigation for a potential breach of lobbying laws amid suspicions that its employees\u2019 work for senior Conservatives including Boris Johnson could have overlapped with their day jobs representing paying clients. The Guardian can disclose that the inquiry began in the summer after concerns were raised that the business or its staff could be illegally operating as an unregistered lobbyist. CTF Partners has so far failed to provide sufficient information to satisfy regulators that it did not use its employees\u2019 access to senior politicians to improperly influence government policy. This has prompted the registrar of consultant lobbyists to take the rare decision to exert its legal powers and formally demand CTF Partners provides detailed evidence showing how the company ensured it did not allow the aims of its clients \u2013 which include major corporates and foreign governments \u2013 to influence their staff\u2019s unpaid work with senior politicians including the prime minister. Evidence uncovered by the Guardian in a series of stories this year shows CTF has worked with the Saudi Arabian government, major fossil fuel producers, and anti-cycling campaigners, tobacco firms and sugary drinks producers on campaigns. \u201cWhat do they have in place to ensure their representatives, if they\u2019re working with government ministers, stop talking about what their other paying clients are doing? Whether intentionally or inadvertently they may be doing consultant lobbying activity,\u201d said a spokesperson for the Office of the Registrar of Consultant Lobbyists. The spokesperson emphasised that the investigation is still ongoing and they are merely seeking information. They asked anyone with evidence that CTF Partners may have been acting as an unregistered lobbyist of ministers or senior civil servants to contact the organisation. Since 2015 any company or individual engaged in verbal or written lobbying of ministers or top civil servants in an attempt to influence government policy on behalf of a paying third party has been legally required to enter their name and client on the public register of consultant lobbyists. CTF Partners is not currently registered. Members of the CTF staff worked closely with Tory MPs \u2013 including some current ministers \u2013 to undermine Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal, while several senior employees including founding partner Mark Fullbrook and David Canzini took leave this summer to run Johnson\u2019s successful Tory leadership campaign. Crosby\u2019s company strongly denied the claims it could have broken the law governing lobbyists, insisting that its senior employees\u2019 decision to spend the summer volunteering on Johnson\u2019s Tory leadership campaign was unconnected with their day jobs at CTF Partners. It also said that there was no attempt by the employees to influence any legislation through their connection with the prime minister during the leadership contest, that its staff carry out all work in accordance with the law, and that in any eventuality the lobbying act did not apply during the leadership campaign as Johnson was a backbench MP rather than a minister. The request for information could potentially lead to Crosby\u2019s company being required to provide detailed evidence that it has compliance procedures in place to avoid a conflict of interest and does not influence politicians on behalf of third parties. This could include evidence that CTF Partners staff kept a list of meetings with senior politicians and the topics discussed, to show the company did not take advantage of its staff\u2019s work with ministers to benefit paying clients. The investigation was triggered by press reports about CTF Partners and its staff\u2019s involvement in politics, including the recruitment of longstanding Crosby associate Fullbrook to run Johnson\u2019s party leadership campaign. Despite months of correspondence between the government body and CTF Partners, the company has so far failed to satisfy the regulator that it has sufficient compliance procedures in place. It is only the fourth time that the Registrar of Consultant Lobbyists, which was established in 2015, has used its powers to demand information, with Crosby\u2019s firm now having until the end of October to provide detailed evidence. News of the investigation could be an incentive for Downing Street to keep Johnson away from his old political adviser. It came after reports that Crosby has fallen out with his old friend, with Johnson instead seeking the guidance of his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, and his partner, Carrie Symonds. A spokesperson for CT Group, the parent company of CTF Partners, said Fullbrook and Canzini worked on the Johnson leadership campaign in a personal capacity \u201cunconnected to their employment\u201d. \u201cNeither had any communications of any sort on any legislative or policy matters relating to any clients. Their activities on the leadership campaign were focused on the leadership campaign and were directed at the membership of the Conservative party, the relevant electorate. Neither Mr Fullbrook nor Mr Canzini undertook any activities which required registration under the Transparency of Lobbying, Non-Party Campaigning and Trade Union Administration Act 2014.\u201d The company said the leadership campaign focused on ensuring Johnson\u2019s election as the leader of the Conservative party and did not involve approaching government ministers to influence government policy. \u201cWhat\u2019s more Boris Johnson was a backbencher and not a minister during the leadership campaign when Messrs Canzini and Fullbrook worked for his campaign and therefore at any rate he was not covered by the Lobbying Act. To suggest or imply that either of them, or indeed CT Group, used this leadership campaign to lobby ministers of the crown or permanent secretaries, or to undertake any work which requires registration under the act, is demonstrably false. \u201cCT carries out its work in strict adherence to all relevant laws and regulations, it is a condition of staff\u2019s employment, and all staff are regularly trained on all compliance issues to ensure adherence to them.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>With new sporting leagues come new challenges, especially when women\u2019s sport is on a steep upward trajectory and something bursts onto the scene as quickly as AFLW.</p> <p>The current challenge facing AFLW is how to get a consensus when there are 400 players \u2013 who are effectively new to a high-performance sporting environment in a semi-professional league \u2013 with completely differing opinions.</p> <p>Last week, 70% of the AFLW playing group were hoping to get another 5% on board to ratify the collective bargaining agreement the players\u2019 union has been working on for six months. Unfortunately, this wasn\u2019t the case and there is still no date set for the start of pre-season.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/07/aflw-season-up-in-air-after-cba-fails-to-pass-player-vote\">AFLW season up in air after bargaining agreement fails to pass player vote</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There has been a lot heard from the 30% who voted against the deal on the table, but I am one of the 70% who is happy with where we are at. Here\u2019s why.</p> <p>AFLW is just three years old and, despite how long women\u2019s football has been played, this competition is in its infancy. Other sports have had to grow on their own, but the AFL has given its women\u2019s competition a leg up by investing in it. A lot can be said for its growth, but it is fair to say leagues don\u2019t go overnight from eight teams to 14, and then likely 18, without growing pains. And we are currently experiencing some big ones.</p> <p>When the AFLPA first came to us with a proposed CBA, which included eight games in 2020 and nine games for 2021 and 2022, the playing group got together and said we would like to see year-on-year growth in the competition. The AFLPA, after further negotiations with the AFL, came back to say they had increased year three from nine to 10 games to provide this continued growth. At this point the majority of the playing group was happy.</p> <p>Last week there was accusations the AFLPA has not listened to the players. This is absolutely not the case. The AFLPA started the CBA process by talking to players about their priorities so they could negotiate outcomes on our behalf. Since then there have been various meetings, emails and calls. Players have received comprehensive details of the proposed deal and the AFLPA has been responsive to every request that my colleagues and I have had.</p> <p>A competition expansion relies on many things: the amount of money poured in by the AFL; the pressure that puts on clubs themselves; the amount of work staff are currently doing; club costs.

      "bodyText": "With new sporting leagues come new challenges, especially when women\u2019s sport is on a steep upward trajectory and something bursts onto the scene as quickly as AFLW. The current challenge facing AFLW is how to get a consensus when there are 400 players \u2013 who are effectively new to a high-performance sporting environment in a semi-professional league \u2013 with completely differing opinions. Last week, 70% of the AFLW playing group were hoping to get another 5% on board to ratify the collective bargaining agreement the players\u2019 union has been working on for six months. Unfortunately, this wasn\u2019t the case and there is still no date set for the start of pre-season. There has been a lot heard from the 30% who voted against the deal on the table, but I am one of the 70% who is happy with where we are at. Here\u2019s why. AFLW is just three years old and, despite how long women\u2019s football has been played, this competition is in its infancy. Other sports have had to grow on their own, but the AFL has given its women\u2019s competition a leg up by investing in it. A lot can be said for its growth, but it is fair to say leagues don\u2019t go overnight from eight teams to 14, and then likely 18, without growing pains. And we are currently experiencing some big ones. When the AFLPA first came to us with a proposed CBA, which included eight games in 2020 and nine games for 2021 and 2022, the playing group got together and said we would like to see year-on-year growth in the competition. The AFLPA, after further negotiations with the AFL, came back to say they had increased year three from nine to 10 games to provide this continued growth. At this point the majority of the playing group was happy. Last week there was accusations the AFLPA has not listened to the players. This is absolutely not the case. The AFLPA started the CBA process by talking to players about their priorities so they could negotiate outcomes on our behalf. Since then there have been various meetings, emails and calls. Players have received comprehensive details of the proposed deal and the AFLPA has been responsive to every request that my colleagues and I have had. A competition expansion relies on many things: the amount of money poured in by the AFL; the pressure that puts on clubs themselves; the amount of work staff are currently doing; club costs. There is no certainty broadcasters can televise any extra games and there is a real risk that if a 13-game season were to be played, but not all games were televised, a dangerous precedent would be set. Broadcasting 100% of games every season is hugely important when it comes to the future financial sustainability of AFLW. Former Diamonds captain Liz Ellis, the biggest role model in my career, used to be paid $100 a game. She fought for better conditions for all players, but always with the sport\u2019s reputation in front of her mind, as without the sport there is no where to go (or grow). After leading Australia to victory at the 2007 Netball World Cup, Ellis retired but the following year the ANZ Championship was born. Netball rookies were paid a minimum of $10,000, much more than what Australia\u2019s best received the year before. And now, 12 years later, players are on a minimum wage of $30,000 with a few earning more (between $60,000 and $100,000 including Diamonds payments). What helped netball grow? Attendances rose with the advent of the new competition, a broadcast deal increased presence on TV, more sponsors started investing and the players, myself included, were rewarded with sponsorships due to the increased exposure. Growth takes time. It doesn\u2019t happen overnight. There are things we can do, but we need to work harder together \u2013 the playing group, the AFLPA, the AFL and our clubs. Without money coming in, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to make such demands. At the moment, there is no risk in signing a CBA that shows growth year-on-year and continues to build AFLW. The risk in not signing is that pre-season does not start on time, with the possibility of not playing at all. I can\u2019t see that is a risk worth taking.

They had both been booked since November last year but were told last week that their speeches had been cancelled due to being \u201cincongruent\u201d with the rest of the conference, Drake and Dreyfus told the Guardian. The Australian Information Security Association advised them of the cancellation, but it is understood it came after pressure from the event partner, Australian Cyber Security Centre, the Australian government\u2019s peak cyber security agency. Drake was a former senior executive at the US National Security Agency, and leaked information about the NSA\u2019s data gathering in 2006. He was prosecuted under the Espionage Act in 2010, but the case collapsed. Drake said the cancellation of his speech on the \u201cgolden age of surveillance\u201d was \u201cOrwellian\u201d and the first time, anywhere in the world, he has had a speech cancelled at a conference. \u201cThis is the first time ever I\u2019ve been censored at a conference. How ironic it is here in Australia,\u201d said Drake. \u201cI was literally on the agenda up until a few days ago. The link appears to be whistleblowing. \u201cIf you are a whistleblower, you are persona non grata. I think there was significant pressure at the last minute at what appears to be a review of the entire agenda.\u201d Drake said his speech was to be on surveillance as a global growth industry, and the insatiable demand for people\u2019s data, not just from governments but from businesses. \u201cWhat is the price of surveillance? Is it \u2018privacide\u2019? Is it no place to hide? Is there any such thing as privacy rights any more? And what is the role of technology in all of this,\u201d he said. Dreyfus\u2019 speech was to be on secure and anonymous digital dropboxes as an anti-corruption tool for whistleblowers. \u201cThis is being rolled out by anti-corruption authorities in Europe and is relevant to the fact that there has been a growth in whistleblower protection laws in the last seven or eight years,\u201d Dreyfus said. \u201cI think they are nervous that there should be any public discussion of whistleblowing technology, and that\u2019s concerning because clearly tech has a role to support whistleblowing and whistleblowing has a role supporting anti-corruption and internal security.\u201d Drake said that he had been open with providing information with the conference organisers on what his talk was to be about, including abstracts and slides. The Guardian sought comment from the Australian Information Security Association and the Australian Cyber Security Centre. Other speakers at the event include officials from ACSC, the chief information security officers at the Victorian government and the Australian Parliament, as well as a representative from Home Affairs talking about the Australian government\u2019s cyber security strategy.",

And you just keep looking at staffing levels, and you look at who we employ and what we\u2019re trying to achieve.\u201d Buttrose also repeated her criticism of the ABC\u2019s own marketing plan, saying many excellent programs slipped under the radar. She called for the ABC to be marketed \u201cmore aggressively\u201d much like the commercial media in which she spent most of her career. One of the questions in the Australia Talks survey was about political correctness and Buttrose told ABC Breakfast co-host Michael Rowland she agreed \u201c100%\u201d that political correctness had gone too far. \u201cEven in the workplace, the way men and women used to talk to one another, which was quite fun, I think doesn\u2019t exist today,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I think of some of the conversations I used to have with Sir Frank Packer, for instance, they simply wouldn\u2019t happen today. \u201cI think Australians are especially good-humoured people, and we like to josh each other in the workplace, and we should be able to do that without anyone being offended or sensitive about it. We\u2019re far too sensitive. \u201cWe\u2019ve sort of suppressed that side of our character. I think we need to bring back the larrikin element of Australia and be very proud of it, because it\u2019s very unique to us.\u201d Australia Talks is created in collaboration with data scientists and social scientists at Vox Pop Labs, the creators of Vote Compass.",

In a wide-ranging speech on human rights, accountability and activism, Bachelet appeared to address recent speeches and comments by the Australian prime minister calling for sovereign nations to eschew an \u201cunaccountable internationalist bureaucracy\u201d. \u201cWe can never answer to a higher authority than the people of Australia,\u201d Morrison said last week. \u201cWe should avoid any reflex towards a negative globalism that coercively seeks to impose a mandate from an often ill-defined borderless global community and, worse still, an unaccountable internationalist bureaucracy.\u201d On Tuesday, Bachelet told the conference Australia had \u201cbenefited from a wealth of advice and recommendations from UN human rights mechanisms\u201d, had ratified most core treaties, has been reviewed regularly by human rights bodies and has received at least nine visits since 2008 by UN special rapporteurs. \u201cSometimes I hear Australian commentators bemoan all this attention, suggesting the UN human rights machinery should focus its attention elsewhere,\u201d she said. \u201cBut this scrutiny is not the function of some international policing system enforcing rules from outside. \u201cIt is based on international standards that Australia has helped to create; which successive Australian governments have voluntarily adopted; and which Australians themselves \u2013 people like you \u2013 have sought to engage and leverage, in your efforts to make Australia a better, more inclusive and humane place.\u201d She said that in many ways she thought Australians looked \u201coutwards\u201d to these human rights mechanisms because the country lacked a comprehensive national charter or set of human rights laws of its own. The \u201cpatchwork of laws\u201d which existed needed updating, its gaps filled and its broad exemptions clarified, she said, adding that they also tended to be framed in negative terms \u2013 prohibiting particular actions \u2013 than positive terms which were proactive. Bachelet detailed several areas of concern in Australia, including thus far unenforced recommendations to raise the age of criminal responsibility to at least 14 years \u2013 it is currently just 10 \u2013 and immigration policy. Bachelet, who was president of Chile from 2006 to 2010 and from 2014 to 2018, told the conference she was pleased to return to the country that gave her refuge as a 23-year-old fleeing the Pinochet regime. \u201cI recall the solidarity, warmth, and generosity Australians showed me at that time, although I cannot help wonder whether I would experience the same as a refugee today.\u201d Bachelet noted the \u201cmainstay of Australia\u2019s migration and asylum system\u201d, mandatory detention. \u201cThe people it affects have largely committed no crime; many of them are in very vulnerable situations, and some are children, yet they are subjected to prolonged, indefinite and effectively unreviewable confinement,\u201d she said. \u201cI know that Australia\u2019s asylum and migration policies have become entrenched over the years by successive governments. But I strongly believe that we are at a point now where it is time to roll back these policies, or at least mitigate their worst effects.\u201d She urged Australian parliamentarians not to reverse the \u201csmall steps of progress that have been made\u201d by repealing the medevac law, which did mitigate the harmful effects of detention. The law \u2013 which allows for a doctor-recommended medical transfer of sick asylum seekers and refugees from offshore centres to Australia \u2013 was an example of a practical improvement to Australia\u2019s asylum system to uphold human rights obligations, she said. \u201cI am concerned that the plans to repeal this law may mean more \u2013 and costly \u2013 court battles, with lives being put at risk.\u201d While it pushes to repeal the medevac laws, the government is also seeking to appeal in the high court a federal court ruling relating to dozens of medical transfers of asylum seekers and refugees. Should the medevac process be closed, the government\u2019s suit appeal to determine the federal court has no jurisdiction to hear legal applications for medical transfers, further shutting down avenues for sick refugees and asylum seekers in PNG and Nauru.",

A parliamentary inquiry found in February that organised crime and illegitimate labour hire companies were taking advantage of immigration laws to exploit workers who were in Australia waiting for their claims to be processed \u2013 mostly Malaysians on electronic travel authorities. \u201cThese individuals are exploiting Australia\u2019s protection visa and merits review systems by repeatedly applying for merits review of the decision to refuse their protection visa application, allowing them to stay in Australia for a significant amount of time and seek employment,\u201d the report said. In some cases the appeals process takes up to eight years, and has cost $46m in the last three years. Labor has repeatedly focused on the high number of protection claims by people flying into the country. Keneally said the plane arrivals outstripped the number of people who sought asylum by boat under a Labor government. Since the Coalition took power few asylum seeker boats have made it to Australian territory. Since July 2013 no person who arrives by boat is allowed to lodge a protection visa, and more than 3,000 people have been sent to offshore detention in Nauru and Manus Island. But the government\u2019s data revealed that 167 applications were lodged by people who arrived \u201clawfully through a seaport, such as on a cruise ship, container ship or yacht\u201d between 1 July 2014 and 19 August 2019. The immigration minister, David Coleman, told Guardian Australia less than 0.25% of people who arrived \u201clawfully\u201d in Australia applied for protection and most were refused. \u201cThe arrival of people on boats under Labor directly disadvantaged people who would otherwise have found support in Australia under our humanitarian program,\u201d he said. On Tuesday afternoon Coleman labelled Labor\u2019s attack a \u201cspectacular own goal\u201d because Labor had granted 31% more protection visas to air arrivals in its final three years of government than the Coalition in its last three years. He also criticised the opposition party for seeking an \u201cextraordinary\u201d increase to the refugee intake. Asked if he was suggesting the granting of protection visas to refugees was a negative, Coleman said the existing humanitarian program was generous and questioned why Labor wanted to increase it. \u201cPeople can apply but the question is what happens when they apply, and are they given those visas or not?\u201d Coleman said about 25,000 people were being processed or were appealing the rejection of their claims, and those who were not were \u201crequired to leave\u201d. However, Coleman repeatedly failed to answer how many people in Australia were supposed to leave but couldn\u2019t be found, and repeatedly failed to answer why there might be more people seeking asylum in Australia after arriving by air. According to the UN there were 3.5 million asylum seekers in the world in 2018, an increase of 1.7 million on the previous year. The government\u2019s processing of asylum applications at airports has been questioned after revelations it does not track how many claims are lodged at airports before or during immigration clearance. Migration experts expressed concern that the lack of data meant there was no way to scrutinise if Australian Border Force was assessing people properly.",

      "bodyText": "Live political reporting continues on Tuesday\u2019s blog: Good afternoon, pals. A few things that happened on my watch this afternoon: The Minnesota senator and presidential hopeful Amy Klobuchar has reportedly raised $4.8m in the third quarter of her 2020 presidential bid. The fundraising round puts Klobuchar in the middle of the Democratic fundraising for the third straight quarter, reports the Associated Press. The senator has raised more than some rivals but less than top-tier candidates such as Bernie Sanders, who raised $25.3m last quarter, and Elizabeth Warren, who raised $24.6m. There\u2019s no end in sight in the contract talks between the United Auto Workers union and General Motors \u2013 a dispute that has sent at least 49,000 workers to the picket lines. This week, workers rejected a company offer and extended the strike, reported the Associated Press. And Warren sounded off against Facebook and its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, partly for what she said was the CEO\u2019s lack of action in the face of election interference by the Russians. US Senator and 2020 presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren leveled a broadside against Facebook and its CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday, partly for what she said was the CEO\u2019s lack of action in the face of election interference by the Russians. Tension between Zuckerberg and Warren publically crested in recent weeks after a source leaked two hours of audio in which the Facebook CEO rallied staffers against competitors, critics, and Elizabeth Warren. The fight continues for auto workers striking for job security There will be no swift end to the ongoing contract talks between the United Auto Workers union and General Motors in a dispute that has sent at least 49,0000 workers to the picket lines. This week, workers rejected a company offer, extending the strike for longer than three worrks, reports the Associated Press. Contract talks aimed at ending a 22-day strike by the UAW against General Motors continued on Monday after United Auto Workers union bargainers rejected a company offer on Sunday. The United Auto Workers vice-president Terry Dittes expressed skepticism that a quick settlement could be found in a dispute that has crippled General Motor\u2019s factories. Dittes\u2019 said GM responded Sunday morning by agreeing to the terms of a previous offer and and made few changes. Amy Klobuchar has been able to raise $4.8 mn in the third quarter of her 2020 presidential bid. The fundraising puts the Minnesota senator in the middle of the Democratic fundraising for the third straight quarter, reports the Associated Press. More from the Associated Press: Klobuchar has raised more than some rivals but less than top-tier candidates such as Sen. Bernie Sanders, who raised $25.3 million last quarter, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who raised $24.6 million. Klobuchar said during a stop in New Hampshire on Sunday that she\u2019s been careful about how the campaign spends money and \u201cwe have money in the bank.\u201d The campaign, which announced its total ahead of the Oct. 15 filing deadline, did not disclose how much cash it has on hand. \u201cWe feel good about our number,\u201d Klobuchar said. \u201cI\u2019m staying in this race till the end.\u201d Klobuchar started airing her first TV ads in Iowa and New Hampshire last week \u2014 the first of which feature her closing remarks from last month\u2019s Democratic presidential debate, in which she described herself as someone who tells the truth and doesn\u2019t make promises she can\u2019t keep. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be president for half of America. I want to be president for all of America,\u201d she says. Klobuchar raised $5.2 million in the first quarter and nearly $4 million in the second quarter. Hi, I\u2019m Mario Koran taking over for Amanda Holpuch here on the west coast. Here\u2019s what\u2019s happened so far today... US senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, joined the wave of Republicans and Democrats criticizing Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw US troops from northern Syria, allowing Turkey to take control of the military operations there. South Carolina senator, Lindsey Graham, led the charge through the morning, appearing on Fox News and tweeting about how he opposed the decision. The Trump campaign held a call with reporters about the 2020 election, where they explained a rule change to Republican state party structures that will effectively make it so Trump doesn\u2019t face other Republican challenges at the nominating convention. They emphasized this was \u201cnot done from a position of weakness.\u201d A week after having a heart attack, Democratic presidential candidate, Bernie Sanders, took a walk with his wife, Jane, near their home in Vermont. US authorities have taken security measures to protect a US intelligence official who filed a whistleblower complaint which spark the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump, according to Reuters: An anonymous source told Reuters that lawyers for the whistleblower expressed concern in a Sept 28 letter to the acting director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire, that their client\u2019s safety could be at risk after Trump suggested he was a spy who had committed treason. They said certain individuals had offered a $50,000 \u201cbounty\u201d for any information on the whistleblower\u2019s identity after the official complained to a government watchdog. And the Washington Post has details on the lengths Democrats are going to to protect the whistleblower: House Democrats eager to protect a whistleblower who raised alarms over President Trump pressuring a foreign leader to investigate a political rival are considering testimony at a remote location and possibly obscuring the individual\u2019s appearance and voice \u2014 extraordinary moves to prevent Trump\u2019s congressional allies from revealing the identity, according to three officials familiar with the discussions. Democratic investigators are concerned that without such rare precautions, Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee could learn and then leak the identity of the whistleblower, who has agreed to answer questions before the intelligence committees in both the House and Senate. Brendan Gleeson will play Donald Trump opposite Jeff Daniels as James Comey in a TV adaptation of the former FBI director\u2019s memoir A Higher Loyalty. CBS bought the rights to Comey\u2019s book after a bidding war last year. Deadline reported on Monday that filming on the miniseries will begin in November, after Daniels finishes a year-long Broadway run in Aaron Sorkin\u2019s hit adaptation of Harper Lee\u2019s classic novel. An air date is yet to be determined. The TV version of Comey\u2019s hit Trump book is not alone. The Emmy-winning director Jay Roach, for example, is attached to the screen version of Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House by Michael Wolff. For the first time on record, the 400 wealthiest Americans last year paid a lower total tax rate \u2014 spanning federal, state and local taxes \u2014 than any other income group, according to newly released data analyzed by the New York Times. That\u2019s a sharp change from the 1950s and 1960s, when the wealthy paid vastly higher tax rates than the middle class or poor. Since then, taxes that hit the wealthiest the hardest \u2014 like the estate tax and corporate tax \u2014 have plummeted, while tax avoidance has become more common. President Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cut, which was largely a handout to the rich, plays a role, too. It helped push the tax rate on the 400 wealthiest households below the rates for almost everyone else. The secretary of defense for public affairs, Jonathan Hoffman, said in a statement it does not support a Turkish operation in northern Syria. Despite the president giving a green light for that to occur, the defense department\u2019s statement claims that their position is in tune with the presidents. The Department of Defense made clear to Turkey - as did the President - that we do not endorse a Turkish operation in Northern Syria. The US Armed Forces will not support, or be involved in any such operation. In conversations between the Department and the Turkish military we have consistently stressed that coordination and cooperation were the best path toward security in the area. Secretary Esper and Chairman Milley reiterated to their respective Turkish counterparts that unilateral action creates risks for Turkey. As the President has stated, Turkey would be responsible, along with European nations and others, for thousands of ISIS fighters who had been captured and defeated in the campaign lead by the United States. The homeland security department released a statement in response to the department\u2019s acting secretary, Kevin McAleenan, deciding not to speak after protestors interrupted his remarks at an immigration conference this morning. The department said McAleenan\u2019s right to free speech and assembly were \u201crobbed.\u201d \u201cUnfortunately the acting secretary and the audience did not get the opportunity to engage in a robust dialogue this morning due to the disruptions of a few activists,\u201d the department said in its statement. \u201cThe acting secretary thanked the organizers and returned to work protecting the homeland and American values.\u201d The demonstrators, who represent a coalition of immigrant advocacy groups, also sent around a statement. \u201cNo Trump henchmen should be given a platform to spread hatred or defend the racist, xenophobic policies put into place by Donald Trump and Stephen Miller,\u201d said CREDO Action campaign director Nicole Regalado, who disrupted McAleenan\u2019s speech. \u201cInstitutions that elevate the architects and enforcers of Trump\u2019s hate and normalize that cruelty can expect to hear from us.\u201d A week after having a heart attack, Democratic presidential candidate, Bernie Sanders, took a walk with his wife, Jane, near their home in Vermont. US senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has joined the wave of Republicans and Democrats criticizing Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw US troops from northern Syria, allowing Turkey to take control of the military operations there. \u201cA precipitous withdrawal of US forces from Syria would only benefit Russia, Iran, and the Assad regime,\u201d McConnell, a Republican senator for Kentucky, said in a statement. \u201cAnd it would increase the risk that ISIS and other terrorist groups regroup.\u201d I urge the President to exercise American leadership to keep together our multinational coalition to defeat ISIS and prevent significant conflict between our NATO ally Turkey and our local Syrian counterterrorism partners. Major new conflict between Turkey and our partners in Syria would seriously risk damaging Turkey\u2019s ties to the United States and causing greater isolation for Turkey on the world stage. The Trump campaign just held a call with reporters about 2020. The call centered on a rule change to Republican state party structures that will effectively make it so Trump won\u2019t face his in-party challengers at the Republican national convention. Utah senator Mitt Romney, a Republican, and Connecticut senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat, have released a statement critical of Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw US troops from northern Syria. \u201cThe president\u2019s decision to abandon our Kurdish allies in northern Syria in the face of an assault by Turkey is a betrayal that will have grave humanitarian and national security consequences,\u201d said the senators, who are chairman and ranking member, respectively, of the Senate foreign relations subcommittee on near East, South Asia, Central Asia and Counterterrorism. \u201cAfter enlisting support from the Kurds to help destroy ISIS and assuring Kurdish protection from Turkey, the US has now opened the door to their destruction,\u201d they said. \u201cThis severely undercuts America\u2019s credibility as a reliable partner and creates a power vacuum in the region that benefits ISIS.\u201d South Carolina senator, Lindsey Graham, continues to lead the charge among Republicans publicly challenging Donald Trump\u2019s move in northern Syria. Graham borrows from Trump\u2019s book and compares his actions to those of Barack Obama \u2013 though unlike Trump, he does so unfavorably. It\u2019s been a busy morning. House Democrats issued subpoenas to the defense department secretary and the office of management and budget\u2019s acting director as part of their inquiry into Trump\u2019s request for Ukraine to help him target a political rival. Late last night, the White House announced an abrupt foreign policy change that has left the US abandoning its allies in northern Syria and sending Turkish forces in. Trump has found little support within his party for this decision and prominent allies, such as Lindsey Graham, have vehemently criticized the move. While Republicans were getting angry about that, a federal judge decided Trump should have to turn over eight years of his personal and corporate tax returns, a decision that was stayed a couple hours later. The acting homeland security, Kevin McAleenan, was blocked from speaking at an immigration conference by protestors from CREDO Action, Justice for Muslims Collective, La ColectiVA, National Immigrant Justice Center, and Sanctuary DMV. House investigators sent a letter today to defense department secretary Mark Esper and the office of management and budget\u2019s acting director, Russell Vought, demanding documents as part of an inquiry into whether Trump urged Ukraine to interfere with the 2020 election by withholding military assistance allocated to Ukraine by Congress. In an email, the chairmen of the House committees on Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs said: \u201cThe enclosed subpoena demands documents that are necessary for the Committees to examine this sequence of these events and the reasons behind the White House\u2019s decision to withhold critical military assistance to Ukraine that was appropriated by Congress to counter Russian aggression,\u201d the Chairmen wrote. If you manage to get past Donald Trump referring to his \u201cgreat and unmatched wisdom,\u201d in his statement about his decision in northern Syria, he goes on to threaten to obliterate Turkey\u2019s economy if they behave in a way he deems inappropriate. He also claims, very incorrectly, that the US captured all of Islamic State. Senator Lindsey Graham, a staunch Trump loyalist on most issues, vowed that Congress would pass a resolution reversing the decision. \u201cIsis is not defeated. This is the biggest lie being told by this administration,\u201d Graham told Fox News. The Guardian\u2019s Middle East correspondent, Martin Chulov, explains how the US\u2019s decision to back Turkey in northern Syria threatens the fight against Islamic State: The abandonment of the Kurds is perhaps the most impactful of all. The debt owed to Kurdish forces is acknowledged by western security partners who realise Isis remains unfinished business. Trump\u2019s US had found itself atop a world order it no longer wanted to lead and, more consequentially, no longer seemed to believe in. In the eyes of some bewildered regional allies, Iraq and Saudi Arabia in particular, the US has nothing left to offer but a chequebook. Trump\u2019s transactional worldview offers no place for history or morality. His ruthless short-term realism ignores the fact that the regional interests he does want to secure \u2013 containing Iran and securing Israel \u2013 are jeopardised by such a blatant betrayal. For all the US president\u2019s talk of taking on Iran, the Iranian attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil supply last month received no response from the US and has instead sparked a detente between Riyadh and Tehran that will inevitably lead to new trade openings and puncture US efforts to crush Iran\u2019s economy. Senator Rand Paul, a Republican, is the first prominent Republican in Congress to come out in support of Trump\u2019s decision to abandon US allies in northern Syria, the Kurds, and instead support a Turkish offensive in the area. The decision reportedly caught the Pentagon off-guard and led one of Trump\u2019s most powerful allies in Congress, South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham, to criticize the decision on Fox News and on Twitter. \u201cI like President Trump, I\u2019ve tried to help him,\u201d Graham said. \u201cThis to me is just unnerving to its core.\u201d Michelle Obama is releasing a companion book to her bestselling memoir, Becoming, in November, her published announced on Monday. The book is a journal which \u201cincludes more than 150 inspiring questions and quotes that resonate with key themes in Mrs Obama\u2019s memoir and that are designed to help readers reflect on their personal and family history, their goals, challenges, and dreams, what moves them and brings them hope, and what future they imagine for themselves and their community,\u201d according to publisher Penguin Random House. It will also feature an introduction by Obama. Becoming was the best-selling book of 2018 and the former first lady followed its release with a sell-out book tour across the country. Her husband, Barack Obama, is also writing a memoir. A federal court has issued a stay in the case allowing the Manhattan district attorney to subpoena eight years of tax returns, hours after the court said the president couldn\u2019t be protected from a criminal investigation simply because he was president. This comes after the president tweeted a possible response to the lawsuit response: This tweet comes amid apparently no Republicans, so far, coming out in support of the White House decision to move the US out of northern Syria; an impeachment inquiry; and a federal judge ruling against the president being able to fight subpoenas in criminal investigations because he is president (it is not even 11am in DC). The US has given diplomatic immunity to the wife of a US diplomat after she was treated as suspect in relation to a fatal car crash. UK prime minister Boris Johnson encouraged the US to reconsider its decision to grant immunity to Anne Sacoolas, who left the UK despite telling officers she intended to remain in the UK. Johnson said he would also raise the issue with the White House, if necessary. The acting homeland security secretary, Kevin McAleenan, walked off the stage at an immigration conference he was supposed to speak at today because of interruptions by protesters. When McAleenan took the stage to speak, demonstrators shouted \u201cwhen immigrants are under attack, stand up fight back\u201d and chanted the names of children who died at the border. Demonstrators ignored requests from the conference organizers to stop disrupting McAleenan\u2019s speech so the gathered crowd could ask him questions during the Q&amp;A scheduled for after his remarks. As expected, Trump\u2019s attorneys have filed an appeal to the judge\u2019s decision that his tax returns can be subpoenaed as part of an investigation into whether he violated New York state laws. What remains unclear is whether he has to comply with the ruling and turn over his tax returns during the appeal. Here is a link to the 75-page ruling on Trump\u2019s tax return lawsuit \u2013 where federal judge Victor Marrero rejects Trump\u2019s legal team\u2019s claim that the president can\u2019t be investigated because he is president. Marrero writes: This court cannot endorse such a categorical and limitless assertion of presidential immunity from judicial process as being countenanced by the nation\u2019s constitutional plan, especially in the light of the fundamental concerns over excessive arrogation of power that animated the Constitution\u2019s delicate structure and its calibrated balance of authority among the three branches of the national government, as well as between the federal and state authorities. Hence, the expansive notion of constitutional immunity invoked here to shield the president from judicial process would constitute an overreach of executive power. Federal Judge Victor Marrero this morning rejected Donald Trump\u2019s challenge to the release of his tax returns for a New York state criminal investigation after Trump\u2019s lawyers alleged being president makes him immune to any inquiry. In a 75-page ruling, Marrero said he cannot endorse such a \u201ccategorical and limitless assertion of presidential immunity from judicial process,\u201d according to the AP. Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R Vance Jr, is seeking the tax returns as part of his office\u2019s investigation of the Trump Organization\u2019s involvement in paying two women to keep quiet about their claims of having had affairs with the president. Marrero\u2019s ruling allows the DA\u2019s office to subpoena eight years of the president\u2019s personal and corporate tax returns. Trump\u2019s lawyers have already indicated they will appeal the judge\u2019s decision. Republican senator Lindsey Graham is enraged this morning, taking the rare step of challenging Donald Trump on Twitter and in a phone call to Fox News \u2013 the two direct lines to the president. On Twitter, Graham outlined his opposition to the president\u2019s decision to abandon US allies in northern Syria, the Kurds, and support a Turkish offensive in the area. Graham said the abrupt foreign policy change \u201censures Isis comeback,\u201d \u201cforces Kurds to align with Assad and Iran,\u201d \u201cdestroys Turkey\u2019s relationship with US congress\u201d and \u201cwill be a stain on America\u2019s honor for abandoning the Kurds.\u201d He also said if the plan goes forward, the Senate will ask for a reversal of the decision. \u201cIf I\u2019m an Isis fighter, I\u2019ve got a second lease on life,\u201d Graham told Fox News. \u201cSo to those who think ISIS has been defeated, you will soon see.\u201d \u201cI like President Trump, I\u2019ve tried to help him,\u201d Graham said. \u201cThis to me is just unnerving to its core.\u201d Hello and welcome. Monday has begun with ruptures between the president and members of his own party, the military and the intelligence community because of the White House\u2019s endorsement of a Turkish offensive into northern Syria. This moves US forces out of the area in an abrupt foreign policy change that will in effect abandon Washington\u2019s longtime military partners, the Kurds. The White House announced the major policy shift just before 11pm in Washington on Sunday. Two Fox News reporters said the decision \u201cblindsided\u201d the Pentagon and the Republican South Carolina senator, Lindsey Graham, tweeted the decision is a \u201cdisaster in the making\u201d. This abrupt decision comes as Trump faces an impeachment inquiry because of a whistleblower report detailing a months-long attempt by the president and allies to get a foreign government to investigate a political rival. Last week, Trump doubled down and asked the country identified in the report (Ukraine) and a whole different country (China) to do the same. Many Republicans have been silent about this extraordinary decision and have yet to present a cohesive strategy for defending the leader of their party. On the Sunday political talkshow circuit, no member of the Trump administration appeared to defend the president. Amid these two major controversies, Trump is scheduled to lunch today with secretary of state, Mike Pompeo. And Trump will also be briefed by military leaders before dining with them and their spouses in the evening.",
