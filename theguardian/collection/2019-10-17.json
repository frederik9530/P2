      "body": "<h2>1) Time for Liverpool to turn the screw</h2> \n<p>The last time <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/24/manchester-united-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">Liverpool visited Old Trafford</a>, they met a United side struggling with injuries \u2013 even before three players were forced off during the first half. But, though Liverpool were three points clear at the top, they played as though the goalless draw they eventually achieved was an acceptable result. In the event, Manchester City pipped them to the title by a point, and though that required a phenomenal run of 14 straight wins, had Liverpool embraced the pressure and played with their usual intensity in that game they would now be champions of England, not into their 30th season without a league title. On Sunday, Liverpool will arrive able to wear and excuse any slip-up: they are eight points clear at the top, while United, who are not <em>quite</em> as abhorrently awful <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/oct/16/ole-gunnar-solskjaer-more-time-respect-manchester-united-manager\">as they\u2019ve looked recently</a>, will have some key players back from injury and should be up for the fight. Even so, Liverpool would be foolish to entertain those thoughts. They have one foot on City\u2019s throat and the other aimed at United\u2019s solar plexus; allowing them to escape instead of kicking them when they\u2019re down would be a significant oversight with potentially significant repercussions. Playing safe is not always the safe option. <strong>DH</strong></p> \n<p>\u2022<em> Manchester United v Liverpool (4.30pm, all times BST, Sunday)</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b5c42063-e9a0-49a2-92c5-24ba2021a269\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Twitter:</b> follow us at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardian_sport\">@guardian_sport</a></p>\n    <p><b>Facebook:</b> like our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardianfootball\">football</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiansport\">sport</a> pages</p>\n    <p><b>Instagram:</b> our favourite <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardian_sport/\">photos, films and stories</a></p>\n    <p><b>YouTube:</b> subscribe to our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/GuardianFootball\">football</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwD9E_QNwFwrQC7OnPnrg2Q\">sport</a> channels</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>2) <strong>Alarms sounding for Tottenham</strong></h2> \n<p>If there is a state-of-the-art crisis klaxon in Tottenham\u2019s stadium, it is likely to be sounded for the first time should the Premier League\u2019s bottom side consign Spurs to their third defeat in as many games. Having shipped a combined 10 goals in two games against Bayern and Brighton, Tottenham are unlikely to approach this game with confidence, but the international break will at least have provided the majority of their players with a change of scenery in which to try to rid themselves of the ennui permeating their Enfield training HQ. Despite reports that he was distinctly unimpressed with summer transfer dealings, Mauricio Pochettino has said he does not expect any January signings because \u201cI believe in the players we have\u201d. All available evidence suggests his players currently have little or no belief in themselves. A home defeat would likely prompt fury in the stands, albeit among a fanbase who seem as yet undecided in whose direction exactly their ire should be aimed. <strong>BG</strong></p> \n<p>\u2022 <em>Tottenham v Watford (3pm, Saturday)</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"82673d63cdba952574d8761ad7e690d47fce985e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82673d63cdba952574d8761ad7e690d47fce985e/0_0_3000_1885/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harry Kane and Tottenham back in training on Thursday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"628\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harry Kane and Tottenham back in training on Thursday.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tottenham Hotspur FC via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>3) <strong>Silva\u2019s job on the line against Hammers?</strong></h2> \n<p>Marco Silva survived the international break but should Everton lose to West Ham there is a chance he may not survive beyond the weekend. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/12/marco-silva-precipice-everton-manager\">The situation is that critical</a> for the Portuguese, following four straight league defeats which has put his side in the relegation zone before Saturday\u2019s game. The omens are not good either. Two years ago, Ronald Koeman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/oct/23/ronald-koemans-everton-sacking\">was sacked</a> after Everton lost to a team from London in October; Arsenal were the visitors, 5-2 the final score, and given Everton\u2019s defensive travails right now \u2013 particularly at set pieces \u2013 who is to say they will not concede as many this weekend? Silva needs to tighten up his side and change it. The 4-2-3-1 formation he stubbornly sticks to is not working while certain players, most notably Gylfi Sigurdsson, have been performing poorly for some time. What\u2019s for sure is that a failure to improve and adapt will cost Silva and, if he\u2019s not careful, could do so very soon. <strong>SN</strong></p> \n<p>\u2022 <em>Everton v West Ham (12.30pm, Saturday)</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>4) Vulnerable champions head to Palace</h2> \n<p>Crystal Palace have made a brilliant start to the season, and could scarcely be better placed for the visit of the champions. Manchester City, on the other hand, have not looked as vulnerable in quite some time, and Roy Hodgson will seek to exploit that. Most likely, he will ask Wilfried Zaha and Jordan Ayew to rove in the spaces between City\u2019s full-backs and centre-backs \u2013 such as there are \u2013 and, if their teammates can get them the ball, Palace are in the game. Pep Guardiola clearly doesn\u2019t fancy John Stones \u2013 and with fair reason \u2013 but he must now rely on him, while Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi remains a liability. However \u2013 and it really is an enormous however \u2013 Stones\u2019s return from injury means Fernandinho is no longer required at the back, and with Kevin De Bruyne also fit again, City have a full complement of midfielders. Hodgson cannot simply plan his team\u2019s route to goal but must somehow fathom how they avoid being taken apart. One job is significantly easier than the other. <strong>DH</strong></p> \n<p>\u2022 <em>Crystal Palace v Manchester City (5.30pm, Saturday)</em></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/17/leicester-v-liverpool-pushed-back-to-8pm-for-amazon-boxing-day-screening\">Liverpool fans fuming over Amazon's 8pm Boxing Day fixture change</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>5) Will Leicester sustain their strong start?</h2> \n<p>Football365 recently published <a href=\"https://www.football365.com/news/whisper-it-but-leicester-city-arent-a-good-attacking-side\">an article</a> that broke down the attacking numbers surrounding Leicester\u2019s very good start to the season and hypothesised that they are quite simply unsustainable. For instance, Jamie Vardy\u2019s five goals have come from seven shots on target, while the four Ricardo Pereira and Wilfred Ndidi have scored between them have come from four shots on target. So a drop off is coming. There was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/05/liverpool-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report\">the loss at Liverpool</a> before the international break and now a game against a Burnley side whose own decent start has gone under the radar somewhat. Sean Dyche\u2019s men are seventh, having won two of their past three games and lost only once away from home. They won\u2019t be pushovers at the King Power and could stifle a Leicester side who, if the stats are anything to go by, are playing at a level that is remarkable in more ways than one. <strong>SN</strong></p> \n<p>\u2022 <em>Leicester v Burnley (3pm, Saturday)</em></p> \n<h2>6) <strong>Brighton must build on lightbulb moment</strong></h2> \n<p>Brighton have never won at Villa Park, but will fancy their chances of breaking that duck at the 12th time of asking. Graham Potter\u2019s side went into the international break on the back of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/05/brighton-tottenham-premier-league-match-report\">3-0 dismantling of Tottenham</a> that had all the hallmarks of a lightbulb moment; a game in which their players put into practice to devastating effect the possession-based philosophy their erudite manager has been preaching. With a run of winnable games against Villa, Everton, Norwich and Manchester United to come, they must show their performance against Spurs was no one-off. But, following the slaughter they visited upon Norwich at Carrow Road, Villa should provide a stern test. <strong>BG</strong></p> \n<p>\u2022 <em>Aston Villa v Brighton (3pm, Saturday)</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"970fa11831ebbd1e1b1d7303198a2928cb972277\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/970fa11831ebbd1e1b1d7303198a2928cb972277/0_0_2700_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Will Brighton build on their beating of Spurs?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Will Brighton build on their beating of Spurs?</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jane Stokes/ProSports/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>7) Hudson-Odoi can be the key for Chelsea</h2> \n<p>After difficult starts to the season, neither manager will have welcomed the international break. Frank Lampard had Frank Lampard\u2019s Chelsea playing with freedom and zest, while Steve Bruce had finally copied Rafael Ben\u00edtez, thereby restoring Newcastle\u2019s discipline and intensity. However, it is not hard to predict the flow of this game: Newcastle will invite Chelsea on to them and hope to nick a goal, while Chelsea will look to pick holes in their back line, making the match an interesting test for Callum Hudson-Odoi. Lots of wingers are adept at running in behind, but the better the team they play for the less opportunity they have to do it, because opposing defences tend to occupy that space. What counts is the ability to pinch a yard from a standing start, pick clever passes that change the angle of attack, and sneak poacher\u2019s goals at the back post. If Hudson-Odoi can marry these attributes to his preternatural skill, balance and composure, Chelsea have a star on their hands. <strong>DH</strong></p> \n<p>\u2022 <em>Chelsea v Newcastle (3pm Saturday)</em></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/17/leicester-brendan-rodgers-defends-james-maddison-casino-visit\">Leicester\u2019s Brendan Rodgers defends James Maddison over casino visit</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>8) <strong>Does the table mask shortcomings under Emery?</strong></h2> \n<p>Come Monday night it is possible Arsenal will be second. Victory over Sheffield United combined with City\u2019s failure to win at Palace on Saturday would secure that outcome and leave Unai Emery no doubt feeling satisfied. But while Arsenal\u2019s results have been good, the majority of their performances have not and should they be unconvincing again at Bramall Lane, regardless of the result, it will leave a question mark hanging over the Spaniard\u2019s long-term credentials. Right now Emery seems like a man unsure whether to stick to his conservative principles or twist and let his team\u2019s attacking riches flourish. A shift to something more decisive, and specifically to the latter, could be the thing that shows he knows what he is doing. <strong>SN</strong></p> \n<p>\u2022 <em>Sheffield United v Arsenal (8pm, Monday)</em></p> \n<h2>9) <strong>Saints need to ease pressure on Hasenh\u00fcttl</strong></h2> \n<p>The Southampton jury remains out on Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl, who takes his side to the Black Country to face Wolves. While not being Mark Hughes is a tick on the credit side of the Austrian\u2019s ledger, it will only get him so far. His team have lost three consecutive Premier League matches against middling-to-decent opposition and failed to beat anyone of major significance since Spurs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/mar/09/southampton-tottenham-premier-league-match-report\">at the beginning of March</a>. Hasenh\u00fcttl claims not having too many of his players away on international duty has benefited his team. \u201cIt gave me the chance to work on a few weaknesses in our game that we have seen in our last two games,\u201d he announced. With his team averaging less than a point a game and tough assignments to come against Leicester and Manchester City next, his players urgently need to show they have taken his pointers on board. <strong>BG</strong></p> \n<p>\u2022 <em>Wolves v Southampton (3pm, Saturday)</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"28e69745a4afe59eb0e07e5fafe174b79302dcb2\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/28e69745a4afe59eb0e07e5fafe174b79302dcb2/0_0_4143_2560/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Obafemi jokes with teammates during Southampton training on Thursday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"618\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Obafemi jokes with teammates during Southampton training on Thursday.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Watson/Southampton FC via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>10) Worries for Norwich as memory fades</h2> \n<p>Norwich\u2019s win over Manchester City \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/14/norwich-city-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\">and the manner of it</a> \u2013 made for the most inspirational 90 minutes of the season so far. But subsequent to it, Norwich were beaten <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/21/burnley-norwich-city-premier-league-match-report\">by Burnley</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/28/crystal-palace-norwich-city-premier-league-match-report\">Crystal Palace</a>, then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/05/norwich-city-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report\">walloped by Aston Villa</a>. Now sitting second-bottom, they need points as a matter of urgency. In a way, Bournemouth are ideal next opponents: their desire to play will permit Norwich to do likewise, but wins <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/15/bournemouth-everton-premier-league-match-report\">over Everton</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/20/southampton-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report\">Southampton</a> followed by a creditable defeat <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/06/arsenal-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report\">at Arsenal</a> show the Cherries are also in form. Their front four of Harry Wilson, Callum Wilson, Dominic Solanke and Josh King pose a stern threat to any defence, but the power and intelligence of their press mean Norwich must take more care than most. Playing out from the back against City\u2019s diminutive technicians is one thing, but \u2013 however silly this may sound \u00ad\u2013 doing likewise against Bournemouth is something else entirely.

      "bodyText": "1) Time for Liverpool to turn the screw The last time Liverpool visited Old Trafford, they met a United side struggling with injuries \u2013 even before three players were forced off during the first half. But, though Liverpool were three points clear at the top, they played as though the goalless draw they eventually achieved was an acceptable result. In the event, Manchester City pipped them to the title by a point, and though that required a phenomenal run of 14 straight wins, had Liverpool embraced the pressure and played with their usual intensity in that game they would now be champions of England, not into their 30th season without a league title. On Sunday, Liverpool will arrive able to wear and excuse any slip-up: they are eight points clear at the top, while United, who are not quite as abhorrently awful as they\u2019ve looked recently, will have some key players back from injury and should be up for the fight. Even so, Liverpool would be foolish to entertain those thoughts. They have one foot on City\u2019s throat and the other aimed at United\u2019s solar plexus; allowing them to escape instead of kicking them when they\u2019re down would be a significant oversight with potentially significant repercussions. Playing safe is not always the safe option. DH \u2022 Manchester United v Liverpool (4.30pm, all times BST, Sunday) 2) Alarms sounding for Tottenham If there is a state-of-the-art crisis klaxon in Tottenham\u2019s stadium, it is likely to be sounded for the first time should the Premier League\u2019s bottom side consign Spurs to their third defeat in as many games. Having shipped a combined 10 goals in two games against Bayern and Brighton, Tottenham are unlikely to approach this game with confidence, but the international break will at least have provided the majority of their players with a change of scenery in which to try to rid themselves of the ennui permeating their Enfield training HQ. Despite reports that he was distinctly unimpressed with summer transfer dealings, Mauricio Pochettino has said he does not expect any January signings because \u201cI believe in the players we have\u201d. All available evidence suggests his players currently have little or no belief in themselves. A home defeat would likely prompt fury in the stands, albeit among a fanbase who seem as yet undecided in whose direction exactly their ire should be aimed. BG \u2022 Tottenham v Watford (3pm, Saturday) 3) Silva\u2019s job on the line against Hammers? Marco Silva survived the international break but should Everton lose to West Ham there is a chance he may not survive beyond the weekend. The situation is that critical for the Portuguese, following four straight league defeats which has put his side in the relegation zone before Saturday\u2019s game. The omens are not good either. Two years ago, Ronald Koeman was sacked after Everton lost to a team from London in October; Arsenal were the visitors, 5-2 the final score, and given Everton\u2019s defensive travails right now \u2013 particularly at set pieces \u2013 who is to say they will not concede as many this weekend? Silva needs to tighten up his side and change it. The 4-2-3-1 formation he stubbornly sticks to is not working while certain players, most notably Gylfi Sigurdsson, have been performing poorly for some time. What\u2019s for sure is that a failure to improve and adapt will cost Silva and, if he\u2019s not careful, could do so very soon. SN \u2022 Everton v West Ham (12.30pm, Saturday) 4) Vulnerable champions head to Palace Crystal Palace have made a brilliant start to the season, and could scarcely be better placed for the visit of the champions. Manchester City, on the other hand, have not looked as vulnerable in quite some time, and Roy Hodgson will seek to exploit that. Most likely, he will ask Wilfried Zaha and Jordan Ayew to rove in the spaces between City\u2019s full-backs and centre-backs \u2013 such as there are \u2013 and, if their teammates can get them the ball, Palace are in the game. Pep Guardiola clearly doesn\u2019t fancy John Stones \u2013 and with fair reason \u2013 but he must now rely on him, while Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi remains a liability. However \u2013 and it really is an enormous however \u2013 Stones\u2019s return from injury means Fernandinho is no longer required at the back, and with Kevin De Bruyne also fit again, City have a full complement of midfielders. Hodgson cannot simply plan his team\u2019s route to goal but must somehow fathom how they avoid being taken apart. One job is significantly easier than the other. DH \u2022 Crystal Palace v Manchester City (5.30pm, Saturday) 5) Will Leicester sustain their strong start? Football365 recently published an article that broke down the attacking numbers surrounding Leicester\u2019s very good start to the season and hypothesised that they are quite simply unsustainable. For instance, Jamie Vardy\u2019s five goals have come from seven shots on target, while the four Ricardo Pereira and Wilfred Ndidi have scored between them have come from four shots on target. So a drop off is coming. There was the loss at Liverpool before the international break and now a game against a Burnley side whose own decent start has gone under the radar somewhat. Sean Dyche\u2019s men are seventh, having won two of their past three games and lost only once away from home. They won\u2019t be pushovers at the King Power and could stifle a Leicester side who, if the stats are anything to go by, are playing at a level that is remarkable in more ways than one. SN \u2022 Leicester v Burnley (3pm, Saturday) 6) Brighton must build on lightbulb moment Brighton have never won at Villa Park, but will fancy their chances of breaking that duck at the 12th time of asking. Graham Potter\u2019s side went into the international break on the back of a 3-0 dismantling of Tottenham that had all the hallmarks of a lightbulb moment; a game in which their players put into practice to devastating effect the possession-based philosophy their erudite manager has been preaching. With a run of winnable games against Villa, Everton, Norwich and Manchester United to come, they must show their performance against Spurs was no one-off. But, following the slaughter they visited upon Norwich at Carrow Road, Villa should provide a stern test. BG \u2022 Aston Villa v Brighton (3pm, Saturday) 7) Hudson-Odoi can be the key for Chelsea After difficult starts to the season, neither manager will have welcomed the international break. Frank Lampard had Frank Lampard\u2019s Chelsea playing with freedom and zest, while Steve Bruce had finally copied Rafael Ben\u00edtez, thereby restoring Newcastle\u2019s discipline and intensity. However, it is not hard to predict the flow of this game: Newcastle will invite Chelsea on to them and hope to nick a goal, while Chelsea will look to pick holes in their back line, making the match an interesting test for Callum Hudson-Odoi. Lots of wingers are adept at running in behind, but the better the team they play for the less opportunity they have to do it, because opposing defences tend to occupy that space. What counts is the ability to pinch a yard from a standing start, pick clever passes that change the angle of attack, and sneak poacher\u2019s goals at the back post. If Hudson-Odoi can marry these attributes to his preternatural skill, balance and composure, Chelsea have a star on their hands. DH \u2022 Chelsea v Newcastle (3pm Saturday) 8) Does the table mask shortcomings under Emery? Come Monday night it is possible Arsenal will be second. Victory over Sheffield United combined with City\u2019s failure to win at Palace on Saturday would secure that outcome and leave Unai Emery no doubt feeling satisfied. But while Arsenal\u2019s results have been good, the majority of their performances have not and should they be unconvincing again at Bramall Lane, regardless of the result, it will leave a question mark hanging over the Spaniard\u2019s long-term credentials. Right now Emery seems like a man unsure whether to stick to his conservative principles or twist and let his team\u2019s attacking riches flourish. A shift to something more decisive, and specifically to the latter, could be the thing that shows he knows what he is doing. SN \u2022 Sheffield United v Arsenal (8pm, Monday) 9) Saints need to ease pressure on Hasenh\u00fcttl The Southampton jury remains out on Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl, who takes his side to the Black Country to face Wolves. While not being Mark Hughes is a tick on the credit side of the Austrian\u2019s ledger, it will only get him so far. His team have lost three consecutive Premier League matches against middling-to-decent opposition and failed to beat anyone of major significance since Spurs at the beginning of March. Hasenh\u00fcttl claims not having too many of his players away on international duty has benefited his team. \u201cIt gave me the chance to work on a few weaknesses in our game that we have seen in our last two games,\u201d he announced. With his team averaging less than a point a game and tough assignments to come against Leicester and Manchester City next, his players urgently need to show they have taken his pointers on board. BG \u2022 Wolves v Southampton (3pm, Saturday) 10) Worries for Norwich as memory fades Norwich\u2019s win over Manchester City \u2013 and the manner of it \u2013 made for the most inspirational 90 minutes of the season so far. But subsequent to it, Norwich were beaten by Burnley and Crystal Palace, then walloped by Aston Villa. Now sitting second-bottom, they need points as a matter of urgency. In a way, Bournemouth are ideal next opponents: their desire to play will permit Norwich to do likewise, but wins over Everton and Southampton followed by a creditable defeat at Arsenal show the Cherries are also in form. Their front four of Harry Wilson, Callum Wilson, Dominic Solanke and Josh King pose a stern threat to any defence, but the power and intelligence of their press mean Norwich must take more care than most. Playing out from the back against City\u2019s diminutive technicians is one thing, but \u2013 however silly this may sound \u2013 doing likewise against Bournemouth is something else entirely. DH \u2022 Bournemouth v Norwich (3pm, Saturday)",

The disturbances followed a now familiar pattern as a large demonstration called earlier in the evening dispersed and groups of protesters clashed with police in the city centre who say that a clothing shop was set on fire and a bank was vandalised. In the early hours groups of protesters fought with police, throwing stones and at least one petrol bomb in an apparent attempt to reach the seat of the Spanish government in the city. One pro-independence protester was badly beaten by a group of right-wing supporters while once again the streets were acrid with the smell of bonfires of burning rubbish. Numerous injuries were reported. In the midst of this chaos, Catalan public TV and the main Barcelona TV channel ceased broadcasting news, as did at least one of the online dailies, in support of the general strike called for Friday, when marchers from all over Catalonia will converge on the capital. Earlier in the day the Catalan president, Quim Torra, condemned the violent protests that have erupted across the region this week but blamed the unrest on \u201cinfiltrators\u201d seeking to undermine the peaceful image of the pro-independence movement. The violence, which began on Monday night after the Spanish supreme court jailed nine pro-independence leaders over their roles in the failed push for secession two years ago, escalated sharply on Wednesday night. On Wednesday cars were set on fire and Catalan police said molotov cocktails were thrown and officers attacked with stones, acid, fireworks and slingshots. Eighty people, including 46 police officers, were injured overnight and 33 people arrested, according to the Spanish authorities. \u201cNo criminal activity will go unpunished,\u201d said interim interior minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska on Thursday after attending a special meeting with the prime minister, intelligence and security experts. He added that Catalonia had experienced widespread \u201cmaterial and reputational damage\u201d caused by \u201cminority groups who are perfectly organised.\u201d Torra, who had been facing calls to issue an unequivocal condemnation of the violence, appealed for peaceful protests in a televised address in the early hours of Thursday morning. \u201cThis has to stop right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no reason or justification for burning cars, nor any other vandalism. Protest should be peaceful.\u201d But he claimed the violence was down to individuals trying to damage the reputation of the independence movement. \u201cWe cannot allow such groups who infiltrate and provoke to harm the image of a movement which counts millions of Catalans,\u201d he said. Speaking in the regional parliament on Thursday morning, Torra remained defiant, describing the supreme court\u2019s decision to jail the nine leaders for sedition and misuse of public funds as \u201cignominious\u201d. He also suggested that another unilateral independence referendum should be held, adding: \u201cIf we have been sentenced to 100 years in prison for putting out the ballot boxes, the response is clear: we\u2019ll have to put them out again for self-determination.\u201d The Catalan president has been criticised for calling for civil disobedience while sending in Catalan riot police to restore order. On Wednesday afternoon, Torra had tweeted, \u201cViolence does not represent us\u201d, but had gone no further despite two nights of vandalism and skirmishes between protesters and police and an attempt to occupy Barcelona-El Prat airport. Spain\u2019s prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez had urged him to issue a clear condemnation of the violence. Referring to the regional government\u2019s unsuccessful attempts to secure independence, S\u00e1nchez added: \u201cNo leader can camouflage their failure behind curtains of smoke and fire.\u201d Earlier on Wednesday, the jailed leaders had issued a joint plea for peaceful protests after the Spanish government warned any further violence would be met with a \u201cfirm, proportional and united\u201d response. \u201cAll support to mobilisations and massive and peaceful marches,\u201d wrote the nine, who include the former regional vice-president Oriol Junqueras and two influential grassroots leaders, Jordi S\u00e0nchez and Jordi Cuixart. \u201cNo violence represents us.\u201d Thousands of people have also been marching peacefully since Wednesday towards the regional capital, Barcelona, where students are striking and which trade unions are planning to join on Friday. S\u00e1nchez\u2019s political opponents are urging him to take a tough line on the Catalan unrest, but the prime minister has said that a blunt response would only make things worse. Speaking on Wednesday evening after holding talks with other political party leaders, S\u00e1nchez said the government would defend Spain\u2019s constitution and peaceful coexistence but would not be tempted into inflaming tensions. \u201cThe state will always guarantee the rights of those who wish to protest their ideas peacefully,\u201d he said. \u201cBut organised violent groups and those who try to break democratic laws will not achieve their aims \u2026 The only hope of those violent groups is that we\u2019ll make mistakes and become overexcited and divided. They want us to fall for their provocations and feed a violent spiral.\u201d S\u00e1nchez\u2019s caretaker government has already said it could activate article 155 of the constitution, which would allow it to suspend the regional government and assume direct rule of the region. The conservative People\u2019s party (PP) and the centre-right Citizens party want firm and immediate action. The PP leader, Pablo Casado, has accused S\u00e1nchez of \u201ca lack of foresight\u201d and called for the activation of the national security law, which would bring the Catalan regional police force under the control of the central government. Albert Rivera, the leader of the Citizens party, said \u201cthe government needs to act now or we\u2019re going to see a lot of awful problems\u201d. Catalonia has returned to the top of the political agenda as Spain prepares to go to the polls for the fourth time in as many years on November 10. Although S\u00e1nchez\u2019s socialist party won the most votes in April\u2019s general election, it proved unable to form a government, triggering a fresh vote. The last election was called after Catalan pro-independence parties joined forces with their bitter enemies in the PP and Citizens to torpedo S\u00e1nchez\u2019s national budget. S\u00e1nchez\u2019s opponents accuse him of being too beholden to the Catalan pro-independence parties who supported his successful bid to throw the PP out of office with a vote of no confidence. However, the acting prime minister has repeatedly said he will not allow a referendum on Catalan independence and warned that the Spanish constitution must be respected.",

      "bodyText": "Arguably the most effective protest march ever held in Queensland was not attended by tens of thousands of people chanting their upset, but by one man and his dog named Jaffa. It occurred in the coastal sugar town of Bundaberg at 2.45am on April Fool\u2019s Day, 1978. Local dentist, Harry Akers, a declared pacifist and a man consumed with the belief that the civil rights of people were being denied by legislation of the Bjelke-Petersen government which declared that protest marches could by held only after organisers received a police permit to do so. The decision whether or not to grant that permit was in the hands of Police Commissioner Terry Lewis, later jailed for 12 years for corruption. Akers saw Lewis as a puppet of the government and resented his continual refusal to grant march permits to people with genuine grievances. Akers applied for a permit to march in Bundaberg. It was denied by local Inspector Ken Seaniger so Akers devised a plan to challenge the ruling which he saw as abhorrent. It was raining, but at 2.30 am, accompanied by Jaffa held securely on a chain, Akers marched 100 metres on a Bundaberg back street, all the while voicing his protest. The only attendees were a couple of carloads of police, but they realised the absurdity of the situation and did not arrest him and Jaffa. However, the ridicule this action by the courageous Akers caused to be heaped on the Bjelke-Petersen government eventually (three years later) saw the policy abandoned. This week in Brisbane, Akers, now 70 and retired from his high-profile position at the University of Queensland, said he was unwavering in his support for citizens to have the right to protest peacefully. However, he had serious reservations about the course adopted by members of Extinction Rebellion who have been staging disruptive demonstrations in Australian capital cities for the last month. This has resulted in the Queensland Labor premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk announcing she would introduce legislation cracking down on the demonstrators who, she said, were using tactics and material which were \u201cdangerous\u2019\u2019 to police and other responders who had to move them from public situations such as pedestrian crossings to which they had glued themselves. The Palaszczuk government move has attracted criticism from the Left and from traditional Labor supporters, but she is unmoved in her resolve to ensure that further disruption to the city by ER members is minimised. Akers said he felt the Extinction Rebellion protestors were not being effective. He said that protests were only ever successful if the right of their cause was taken up \u201cand the public was brought along with you\u2019\u2019. \u201cThese people have an undeniable right to protest, I feel strongly about that,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cBut I am not sure about their methodology to be frank. There is an element of hypocrisy in me saying that because I took part in illegal street processions which did inconvenience people. \u201cI think anyone with any intelligence is on the same page with these people. We all appreciate the climate problems.\u2019\u2019 Akers said he \u201chad reservations about the tactics of Extinction Rebellion\u2019\u2019. \u201cYou need people who are prepared to take on the establishment, but what I do think is that this recent spate of protests is possibly alienating people who are on-side anyhow,\u2019\u2019 he added. \u201cWould I get involved \u2013 no. That comes from a guy who was arrested several times in relation to street marching and I have a conviction because I refused to apply for bail.\u2019\u2019 Over the last 50 years \u2013 from the early Joh years \u2013 Queensland has seen many very serious protest movements including against a tour of the South African Springboks during apartheid; Aboriginal land rights, the right to march, the lockdown of the waterside, the sacking of more than 1000 Electrical Trades Union members by Joh and the employment of non-union \u201cscabs\u2019\u2019. The last-mentioned was possibly the most violent because Bjelke-Petersen not only sacked the workers but also took away their superannuation. It is a little known fact that the then superannuation board which collected and invested the superannuation for the ETU members was headed by former naval officer and accountant John Wyatt, who at one stage was also treasurer of the National (Country) Party. When the daily protests ended and the strike was over, it was not long before the Bjelke-Petersen reign ended and Labor under Wayne Goss was elected to power. The ETU workers were told they had lost their superannuation entitlements because Joh had ordered they be surrendered to consolidated revenue. However, with Labor winning, Wyatt came forward and told Goss he had not done as he was instructed because he knew it was wrong, and had instead put the total funds in a separate account over which he had control. Perhaps it was his naval training, or his professionality as an accountant that saw him act with such honour, but Wyatt saved the day and the workers got their entitlements. So not all protest movements are without positive outcomes. However, the general feeling in Queensland is that Extinction Rebellion has misread the public mood and that of the government, and adopted the wrong tactics to eventually come out winners. Palaszczuk might be criticised for taking what is interpreted as an \u201cun-Labor\u2019\u2019 attitude to them, but her response and that of her government, appears to more properly reflect public opinion and expectation. And she is facing an election next year.

      "bodyText": "Consumer genetic tests could be giving false reassurance to those at heightened risk of cancers, according to findings presented at an international conference this week. The study, by clinical genetic testing company Invitae, revealed that tests for breast and bowel cancer risk by direct-to-consumer companies such as 23andMe give negative results to the vast majority of those carrying DNA mutations in the genes under investigation. \u201cThese tests should not be taken at face value at all, whether they are positive or negative,\u201d said Edward Esplin from Invitae ahead of the annual meeting of the American Society of Human Genetics in Houston, Texas. \u201cThe data really underscores that there needs to be increased awareness that results from this type of screening may not be wrong but they\u2019re woefully incomplete.\u201d The research also showed that those from Asian and African-American backgrounds were more likely to carry mutations that were not designed to be detected by the consumer tests. The research focused on DNA-based tests relating to breast, ovarian and bowel cancer that were recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. The tests operate by a subject sending a DNA swab in the post for analysis and then receiving results with information about how their genetics could influence their health. In the case of breast and ovarian cancer, the FDA has approved a screening test for three specific mutations on the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, which are most common in people of Ashkenazi Jewish heritage. However, these mutations are rare in people from other backgrounds. Similarly, for bowel cancer, 23andMe offers FDA-authorised tests for two mutations, which are most common among individuals of northern European ancestry. The company explains the limitations of these tests to consumers and on its website. Esplin said that despite this, consumers could be wrongly reassured by a negative result. The study analysed the DNA of 270,806 patients who had been referred by healthcare providers for testing of the MUTYH gene, and 119,328 who had been referred for BRCA1/2 genetic testing. It showed that for both tests, the majority of those carrying mutations would not be spotted, which Invitae describes as a \u201cclinical false-negative result\u201d. For MUYTH, 40% of individuals with mutations in both copies of their MUTYH genes \u2013 consistent with an almost 100% lifetime risk of bowel cancer \u2013 had different mutations to those screened for in the FDA-approved test. This figure rose to 100% for those from Asian backgrounds and 75% for African-Americans. For BRCA genes, 94% of non-Ashkenazi Jewish individuals and 19% of those of Ashkenazi heritage had a mutation that would be missed. Again, the figures were highest for those of Asian (98%) and African-American (99%) ancestry. \u201cIt\u2019s performing a disproportionate disservice to individuals of these underrepresented groups,\u201d Esplin said. \u201cA clinical false-negative result can be incorrectly reassuring, excluding a patient from receiving the preventive care they need based on their risk,\u201d he added. \u201cIt could be the difference between preventing cancer and developing cancer.\u201d In response to the findings, 23andMe said in a statement: \u201cThe claims made by a competitor that we are returning \u2018clinical false negatives\u2019 is incorrect and a false characterisation of 23andMe\u2019s test.

Considering their younger sister, 15-year-old Milly, is an outstanding netballer, the Longstaffs may just be Tyneside\u2019s answer to the Neville family.</p> <p>\u201cTwo footballer brothers and an England netballer sister,\u201d says Sean. \u201cWe\u2019ve said to Milly: \u2018We\u2019ve done our little bit, it\u2019s up to you now.\u2019 She\u2019s really good.\u201d</p> <p>The boys are talking in a decoratively tired backroom at Newcastle\u2019s training ground but their enthusiasm and sheer niceness refreshes it in a way two coats of fresh paint could not rival.</p> <p>Their mother has said the pair \u201creally love each other\u201d and they look slightly startled at being asked whether her words damaged their street cred.</p> <p>\u201cWe genuinely do love each other,\u201d says Sean, firmly. \u201cWe\u2019ll always be there for each other, always keep each other pretty level. There\u2019s not loads of people you can trust, so to have your brother out there alongside you, knowing he\u2019s got your back, is special.</p> <p>\u201cWe used to fight a lot and my mam once had to ask Newcastle\u2019s coaches to have a word and tell us to behave but we got it out of the way at a young age. We realised we had to help each other.\u201d</p> <p>If mutual devotion has long trumped minor disagreements, the pair remain different, with Matty more extrovert and Sean stronger academically. Whereas the latter progressed smoothly through Newcastle\u2019s youth system, impressing hugely in nine first-team appearances last spring before a serious knee injury abridged his season, Matty\u2019s trajectory proved more complicated.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6496b4b0c7e2015106d5ec4cff9d5dff53e6e4e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6496b4b0c7e2015106d5ec4cff9d5dff53e6e4e/96_175_3223_1934/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matty Longstaff celebrates scoring the winner on his Newcastle debut against Manchester United\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matty Longstaff celebrates scoring the winner on his Newcastle debut against Manchester United. \u2018The emotion was crazy,\u2019 says Sean. \u2018It was even better than when I scored my first goal because of what he\u2019d been through.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Serena Taylor/Newcastle United via Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhen he was 10 or 11 Newcastle turned him away,\u201d says Sean. \u201cI\u2019ve seen him crying about it.

I filled up and thought: \u2018I can\u2019t start crying.\u2019 The emotion was crazy. It was just pure happiness. It was even better than when I scored my first goal, just because of the occasion and knowing what he\u2019d been through.\u201d</p> <p>Visceral as the emotions surrounding it remain, Newcastle\u2019s initial rejection was possibly the making of Matty. \u201cIt really pissed me off,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it fired me up.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/audio/2019/oct/17/euro-2020-womens-champions-league-reading-football-weekly-extra-podcast\">Euro 2020, Women's Champions League and Reading \u2013 Football Weekly Extra</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Back at North Shields Juniors, Sunderland tried to sign him several times but he refused to countenance the notion and Middlesbrough received similarly short shrift: \u201cI said: \u2018Stop asking, there\u2019s only one club for me.\u2019 Fortunately I got back to Newcastle.\u201d</p> <p>With Michelle dedicating almost every evening to driving her children to football, netball or cricket practice and spending weekends cheering them on from frequently windswept touchlines, sport shaped their lives. \u201cWe were brought up quite strictly,\u201d says Matty who, like Sean, is also a fine cricketer. \u201cWe had jokes and everything but our parents disciplined us.\u201d</p> <p>After a year in Stockholm, where their father played for Djurg\u00e5rden, the family debated emigrating to Canada. It was a sliding doors moment but England\u2019s north-east coast ultimately won the argument, leaving Longstaff Sr on course for his current role as player-coach at Whitley Warriors.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Before kick-off against Manchester United I looked at Matty and thought, to have two brothers from North Shields starting alongside each other, felt pretty crazy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Whereas the 45-year-old is a veteran, his sons\u2019 on-pitch synchronicity belies their novice status. \u201cPlaying alongside my brother makes it a lot easier,\u201d says Matty. \u201cHe\u2019s so composed.\u201d</p> <p>Sean shakes his head. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have done what he\u2019s done at 19.

Manners matter to the Longstaffs\u2019 parents, David \u2013 a former Great Britain ice hockey player \u2013 and Michelle but if such politeness reflected his upbringing it was also sincere. \u201cIt was only right,\u201d says Matty, who earns around \u00a3850 a week but seems set for a significantly enhanced contract. \u201cI can\u2019t thank him enough. It was a brave move putting me in and backing a kid. He\u2019d been getting a lot of stick; a lot of managers under pressure at such a big club in such an important game would have gone for experience.\u201d With his bonfire-bright ginger hair and adhesive first touch, Matty has, inevitably, been likened to Paul Scholes while Sean\u2019s elegant, straight-backed passing style meant he was hyped as the new Michael Carrick when he broke into Rafael Ben\u00edtez\u2019s side last season. Flattered as the siblings are, there is arguably a better comparison. Considering their younger sister, 15-year-old Milly, is an outstanding netballer, the Longstaffs may just be Tyneside\u2019s answer to the Neville family. \u201cTwo footballer brothers and an England netballer sister,\u201d says Sean. \u201cWe\u2019ve said to Milly: \u2018We\u2019ve done our little bit, it\u2019s up to you now.\u2019 She\u2019s really good.\u201d The boys are talking in a decoratively tired backroom at Newcastle\u2019s training ground but their enthusiasm and sheer niceness refreshes it in a way two coats of fresh paint could not rival. Their mother has said the pair \u201creally love each other\u201d and they look slightly startled at being asked whether her words damaged their street cred. \u201cWe genuinely do love each other,\u201d says Sean, firmly. \u201cWe\u2019ll always be there for each other, always keep each other pretty level. There\u2019s not loads of people you can trust, so to have your brother out there alongside you, knowing he\u2019s got your back, is special. \u201cWe used to fight a lot and my mam once had to ask Newcastle\u2019s coaches to have a word and tell us to behave but we got it out of the way at a young age. We realised we had to help each other.\u201d If mutual devotion has long trumped minor disagreements, the pair remain different, with Matty more extrovert and Sean stronger academically. Whereas the latter progressed smoothly through Newcastle\u2019s youth system, impressing hugely in nine first-team appearances last spring before a serious knee injury abridged his season, Matty\u2019s trajectory proved more complicated. \u201cWhen he was 10 or 11 Newcastle turned him away,\u201d says Sean. \u201cI\u2019ve seen him crying about it. He said: \u2018No one will ever do that to me again.\u2019 From then on he\u2019s worked so hard. It\u2019s why I got a bit emotional when he scored. I filled up and thought: \u2018I can\u2019t start crying.\u2019 The emotion was crazy. It was just pure happiness. It was even better than when I scored my first goal, just because of the occasion and knowing what he\u2019d been through.\u201d Visceral as the emotions surrounding it remain, Newcastle\u2019s initial rejection was possibly the making of Matty. \u201cIt really pissed me off,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it fired me up.\u201d Back at North Shields Juniors, Sunderland tried to sign him several times but he refused to countenance the notion and Middlesbrough received similarly short shrift: \u201cI said: \u2018Stop asking, there\u2019s only one club for me.\u2019 Fortunately I got back to Newcastle.\u201d With Michelle dedicating almost every evening to driving her children to football, netball or cricket practice and spending weekends cheering them on from frequently windswept touchlines, sport shaped their lives. \u201cWe were brought up quite strictly,\u201d says Matty who, like Sean, is also a fine cricketer. \u201cWe had jokes and everything but our parents disciplined us.\u201d After a year in Stockholm, where their father played for Djurg\u00e5rden, the family debated emigrating to Canada. It was a sliding doors moment but England\u2019s north-east coast ultimately won the argument, leaving Longstaff Sr on course for his current role as player-coach at Whitley Warriors. Whereas the 45-year-old is a veteran, his sons\u2019 on-pitch synchronicity belies their novice status. \u201cPlaying alongside my brother makes it a lot easier,\u201d says Matty. \u201cHe\u2019s so composed.\u201d Sean shakes his head. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have done what he\u2019s done at 19. We were in a tough situation and Matty\u2019s controlled the tempo of a Premier League game on his debut.\u201d If the Longstaffs have made North Shields famous for more than its fish quay, Georgian houses and international ferry terminus, their stabilising presence seems imperative at Chelsea on Saturday. \u201cThis season\u2019s been turbulent,\u201d says Sean. \u201cNow it\u2019s about the dressing room sticking together. As long as we\u2019re all fighting for each other we\u2019ll be all right.\u201d He is more worried about Milly\u2019s adolescence in a small town where everybody recognises her celebrity siblings and heads turn when they take their regular place in the crowd at non-league North Shields. \u201cIt can be hard for her at school when everyone\u2019s talking about us; we try to make sure she doesn\u2019t read too much social media. That\u2019s the not so great side of it. We can\u2019t thank her enough for the sacrifices she\u2019s made for us.\u201d Shola Ameobi, who played alongside his brother Sammy at St James\u2019, offers informed advice and a challenge has been set by George and Ted Robledo, Chilean siblings who helped Newcastle to 1952 FA Cup final glory against Arsenal with George scoring the only goal. Reprising that feat is for the future though; right now the Longstaffs are content to hold their own in a changing room staffed with players from a dozen countries including Argentina, Brazil, Ghana and Paraguay. \u201cThe Premier League\u2019s so worldwide,\u201d says Sean. \u201cBefore kick-off against Manchester United I looked across at Matty and thought that to have two brothers from North Shields starting alongside each other felt pretty crazy. A year ago we\u2019d have laughed at the idea.\u201d",

When a Yakuza boss is killed on Mori\u2019s beat, threatening to destroy the fragile truce that has been maintained for the last few years, it appears that the killing may have been undertaken in revenge for a murder in London that Mori\u2019s younger brother, Yuto, carried out.</p> <p>Yuto was believed dead, but nobody ever saw the body and there has been a rumoured sighting of him. Mori\u2019s boss \u2013 a man possibly ensnared in the Yakuza web himself \u2013 requires his underling to go to London and pretend to be a student on a detective refresher course while he does some unofficial digging.

The latter \u2013 which will air the series globally next year \u2013 provided the deep coffers needed to split the setting between Tokyo and London. Mori is played by Takehiro Hira, who gives the detective a bone-deep weariness that makes increasing sense as we see, via a series of flashbacks involving Yuto, that it is not just the burden of ageing parents and a rebellious teenage daughter weighing him down.

A half-Japanese young man, Rodney, proves a useful conduit, but Mori discovers he is also a rent boy with a complex and dangerous life, in which he soon becomes embroiled. In a scene-stealing turn from Will Sharpe, Rodney is full of brio and wit (\u201cI\u2019ll have to ring you back,\u201d he sighs theatrically into his phone when an emotional ex-boyfriend turns up. \u201cI\u2019m in the middle of a Greek play\u201d).

So far, she and Mori have done little but exchange awkward pleasantries. But whatever continent the protagonists come from, we have been here before and international relations will surely take place before series end.</p> <p>Herein lies the problem with Giri/Haji.

      "bodyText": "Activists have responded with outrage after Venezuela won a fiercely contested vote for a seat on the UN\u2019s human rights council on Thursday, despite its well-documented record of human rights abuses. The 193-member world body elected 14 members to the 47-member council on Thursday for three-year terms starting in January, with Venezuela claiming one of the two seats allocated to Latin America with 105 votes. The other seat went to Brazil, whose far-right leader, Jair Bolsonaro, has frequently expressed contempt for the concept of human rights. About 4.5 million Venezuelans have fled their nation\u2019s economic and social collapse, as the embattled president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, has deployed the military to snuff out dissent. Opposition activists, journalists and human rights defenders are often jailed, while security forces loyal to Maduro commit abuses with impunity. \u201cThe inclusion of Venezuela and Brazil to the human rights council marks a backwards step in the advancement of human rights in the region,\u201d said Rodolfo Montes de Oca, a lawyer at Provea, a Venezuelan rights group. Bolsonaro has repeatedly praised the torturers of the country\u2019s military dictatorship, encouraged police to carry out extrajudicial killings and said that he hopes criminals will \u201cdie in the streets like cockroaches\u201d. However, Jos\u00e9 Miguel Vivanco, the Americas director at Human Rights Watch, said that Brazil\u2019s institutions still offered a degree of protection. \u201cDespite Bolsonaro\u2019s very poor record and anti-rights rhetoric, Brazil is still a democracy in which the judiciary, an independent media and NGOs are bravely pushing back,\u201d Vivanco said. \u201cThe Brazilian congress has also been able to stop some of the most egregious draft legislation proposals promoted by Bolsonaro to grant the police power to kill with impunity.\u201d \u201cOn the other hand, Venezuela is beyond the pale,\u201d Vivanco said. \u201cIts authorities are responsible for systematic egregious abuses and a humanitarian emergency.\u201d A coalition of western countries, led by the US, backs Venezuela\u2019s opposition leader, Juan Guaid\u00f3, officially recognizing him as the South American nation\u2019s legitimate president in January this year. But Maduro still clings to power and will probably be emboldened by his country\u2019s new post at the UN. \u201cThey can say they were elected to the human rights council and from there have a voice to push back on their critics,\u201d said David Smilde, an analyst at the Washington Office on Latin America, a thinktank. Opposition politicians, however, were appalled. \u201cIt\u2019s shameful, a travesty,\u201d said Vanessa Neumann, Guaid\u00f3\u2019s ambassador to the UK, who added that the vote will do little to silence Maduro\u2019s critics. \u201cUltimately the march of history\u2019s harsh judgment on Maduro and his regime will not be stopped by this.\u201d Earlier this year, the UN human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, issued a scathing report on Venezuela, which described widespread cases of torture, extrajudicial killings and withholding food and medicines from civilians. The UN human rights council is no stranger to controversy, with repressive countries including Cuba, Saudi Arabia, China, Indonesia and Russia taking seats in the past.

Erdo\u011fan is due to meet his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, in Sochi on Tuesday, where it is expected more concrete talks on the size of Turkey\u2019s planned buffer zone will take place.</p> \n<p>The initial plan was met with scepticism by many Syrian Kurds on Thursday night, as it gives the Turks what they had sought to achieve with the military operation in the first place: removal of Kurdish-led forces from the border.</p> \n<p>When asked, Pence remained silent on whether the agreement amounted to a second abandonment of the US\u2019s former Kurdish allies in the fight against the Islamic State.</p> \n<p>A statement released after the meeting reiterated the US understanding of Turkey\u2019s need for a safe zone which will be \u201cprimarily enforced by the Turkish Armed Forces\u201d after the Kurdish withdrawal, implying that Ankara still intends to occupy the 270m (440km) stretch of land, which includes several important Kurdish towns and parts of a major highway.</p> \n<p>It also made no mention of the presence of Syrian government and Russian troops, who were invited to the area by the SDF to help defend against the Turkish attack<strong>, </strong>and are not bound by the terms of the US-Turkish agreement.</p> \n<p>\u201cOur people did not want this war. We welcome the ceasefire, but we will defend ourselves in the event of any attack \u2026 Ceasefire is one thing and surrender is another thing, and we are ready to defend ourselves. We will not accept the occupation of northern Syria,\u201d the Kurdish political leader Saleh Muslim told local television.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"1c7cf1ad-db3a-47f6-914b-2969dbb2616d\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Who is in control in north-eastern Syria?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Until Turkey launched its offensive&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/09/turkey-launches-military-operation-in-northern-syria-erdogan\">there on 9 October</a>, the region was controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which comprises militia groups representing a range of ethnicities, though its backbone is Kurdish.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Since the Turkish incursion, the SDF has lost much of its territory and appears to be losing its grip on key cities. On 13 October, Kurdish leaders agreed to allow Syrian regime forces to enter some cities to protect them from being captured by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey\">Turkey</a>&nbsp;and its allies. The deal effectively hands over control of huge swathes of the region to Damascus.</p>\n    <p>That leaves north-eastern&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria\">Syria</a>&nbsp;divided between Syrian regime forces, Syrian opposition militia and their Turkish allies, and areas still held by the SDF \u2013 for now.</p>\n    <p>On 17 October Turkish president,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan\">Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan</a>, agreed with US vice-president Mike Pence, to suspend Ankara\u2019s operation for&nbsp; five days in order to allow Kurdish troops to withdraw. The following week, on 22 October, Erdo\u011fan and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/22/turkey-and-russia-agree-deal-over-buffer-zone-in-northern-syria\">agreed on the parameters of the proposed Turkish \u201csafe zone\u201d</a> in Syria.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How did the SDF come to control the region?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Before the SDF was formed in 2015, the Kurds had created their own militias who mobilised during the Syrian civil war to defend Kurdish cities and villages and carve out what they hoped would eventually at least become a semi-autonomous province.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>In late 2014, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/20/turkey-iraqi-kurds-kobani-isis-fighters-us-air-drops-arms\">Kurds were struggling</a>&nbsp;to fend off an Islamic State siege of Kobane, a major city under their control. With US support, including arms and airstrikes, the Kurds managed to beat back Isis and went on to win a string of victories against the radical militant group. Along the way the fighters absorbed non-Kurdish groups, changed their name to the SDF and grew to include 60,000 soldiers.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why does Turkey oppose the Kurds?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>For years, Turkey has watched the growing ties between the US and SDF with alarm. Significant numbers of the Kurds in the SDF were also members of the People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG), an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK) that has fought an insurgency against the Turkish state for more than 35 years in which as many as 40,000 people have died. The PKK initially called for independence and now demands greater autonomy for Kurds inside&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey\">Turkey</a>.</p>\n    <p>Turkey claims the PKK has continued to wage war on the Turkish state, even as it has assisted in the fight against Isis. The PKK is listed as a terrorist group by Turkey, the US, the UK, Nato and others and this has proved awkward for the US and its allies, who have chosen to downplay the SDF\u2019s links to the PKK, preferring to focus on their shared objective of defeating Isis.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are Turkey\u2019s objectives on its southern border?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Turkey aims firstly to push the SDF away from its border, creating a 20-mile (32km) buffer zone that would have been jointly patrolled by Turkish and US troops until Trump\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/07/us-withdrawal-from-syria-leaves-fate-of-isis-fighters-and-families-in-detention-uncertain\">recent announcement</a>&nbsp;that American soldiers would withdraw from the region.</p>\n    <p>Erdo\u011fan has also said he would seek to relocate more than 1 million Syrian refugees in this \u201csafe zone\u201d, both removing them from his country (where their presence has started to create a backlash) and complicating the demographic mix in what he fears could become an autonomous Kurdish state on his border.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How would a Turkish incursion impact on Isis?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Nearly 11,000 Isis fighters, including almost 2,000 foreigners, and tens of thousands of their wives and children, are being held in detention camps and hastily fortified prisons across north-eastern Syria.</p>\n    <p>SDF leaders have warned they cannot guarantee the security of these prisoners if they are forced to redeploy their forces to the frontlines of a war against Turkey. They also fear Isis could use the chaos of war to mount attacks to free their fighters or reclaim territory.<br></p>\n    <p>On 11 October, it was reported that at least five detained Isis fighters had escaped a prison in the region. Two days later, 750 foreign women affiliated to Isis and their children managed to break out of a secure annex in the Ain Issa camp for displaced people, according to SDF officials.</p>\n    <p>It is unclear which detention sites the SDF still controls and the status of the prisoners inside.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michael-safi\"><b>Michael Safi</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve previously stated that Turkey\u2019s proposal of entering a depth of 30km inside Syrian territories is rejected,\u201d Aldar Xelil, another senior political figure, was quoted by local media as saying after news of the Ankara agreement broke.</p> \n<p>The deal was \u201ca great day for civilisation\u201d, Trump told reporters before praising Erdo\u011fan as \u201ca hell of a leader\u201d.</p> \n<p>Trump seemed to endorse Turkey\u2019s aim of ridding the Syrian side of the border of the Kurdish fighters who fought Isis on behalf of the US \u2013 but who Ankara regards as proxies for the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK) that has waged a 35-year insurgency against the Turkish state. \u201cThey had to have it cleaned out,\u201d he told reporters.</p> \n<p>But the deal was condemned by the Republican senator Mitt Romney, who said Trump\u2019s decision to abandon Kurdish allies in Syria \u201cwill stand as a bloodstain in the annals of American history\u201d.</p> \n<p>In Ras al-Ayn, one of the two border towns under attack by Turkey, warplanes and drones were still flying overhead and ground fighting between the SDF and Syrian rebels allied to Turkey continued.</p> \n<p>The US and Turkey have \u201cmutually committed to peaceful resolution and future for the safe zone\u201d, Pence said.

      "bodyText": "The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, has agreed with the US vice-president, Mike Pence, to suspend Ankara\u2019s operation on Kurdish-led forces in north-east Syria for the next five days in order to allow Kurdish troops to withdraw, potentially halting the latest bloodshed in Syria\u2019s long war. Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) fighters would pull back from Turkey\u2019s proposed 20-mile (32km) deep \u201csafe zone\u201d on its border, Pence told reporters in Ankara on Thursday evening after hours of meetings with Turkish officials. \u201cIt will be a pause for 120 hours while the US oversees the withdrawal of the YPG [a Kurdish unit within the SDF] \u2026 Once that is completed, Turkey has agreed to a permanent ceasefire,\u201d Pence said, adding that preparations were already under way. \u201cGreat news out of Turkey!\u201d Donald Trump tweeted just before Pence spoke. \u201cMillions of lives will be saved.\u201d The arrangement, however, appeared to be a significant US embrace of Turkey\u2019s position in the weeklong conflict, and did not publicly define the safe zone\u2019s borders. General Mazloum Kobane of the SDF confirmed the ceasefire deal in comments to local television on Thursday night, but said it only applied to the area between the towns of Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ayn, both of which have seen heavy fighting. Damascus and Moscow, who have since also moved troops into the contested border zone, also had no immediate comment. Erdo\u011fan is due to meet his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, in Sochi on Tuesday, where it is expected more concrete talks on the size of Turkey\u2019s planned buffer zone will take place. The initial plan was met with scepticism by many Syrian Kurds on Thursday night, as it gives the Turks what they had sought to achieve with the military operation in the first place: removal of Kurdish-led forces from the border. When asked, Pence remained silent on whether the agreement amounted to a second abandonment of the US\u2019s former Kurdish allies in the fight against the Islamic State. A statement released after the meeting reiterated the US understanding of Turkey\u2019s need for a safe zone which will be \u201cprimarily enforced by the Turkish Armed Forces\u201d after the Kurdish withdrawal, implying that Ankara still intends to occupy the 270m (440km) stretch of land, which includes several important Kurdish towns and parts of a major highway. It also made no mention of the presence of Syrian government and Russian troops, who were invited to the area by the SDF to help defend against the Turkish attack, and are not bound by the terms of the US-Turkish agreement. \u201cOur people did not want this war. We welcome the ceasefire, but we will defend ourselves in the event of any attack \u2026 Ceasefire is one thing and surrender is another thing, and we are ready to defend ourselves. We will not accept the occupation of northern Syria,\u201d the Kurdish political leader Saleh Muslim told local television. \u201cWe\u2019ve previously stated that Turkey\u2019s proposal of entering a depth of 30km inside Syrian territories is rejected,\u201d Aldar Xelil, another senior political figure, was quoted by local media as saying after news of the Ankara agreement broke. The deal was \u201ca great day for civilisation\u201d, Trump told reporters before praising Erdo\u011fan as \u201ca hell of a leader\u201d. Trump seemed to endorse Turkey\u2019s aim of ridding the Syrian side of the border of the Kurdish fighters who fought Isis on behalf of the US \u2013 but who Ankara regards as proxies for the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK) that has waged a 35-year insurgency against the Turkish state. \u201cThey had to have it cleaned out,\u201d he told reporters. But the deal was condemned by the Republican senator Mitt Romney, who said Trump\u2019s decision to abandon Kurdish allies in Syria \u201cwill stand as a bloodstain in the annals of American history\u201d. In Ras al-Ayn, one of the two border towns under attack by Turkey, warplanes and drones were still flying overhead and ground fighting between the SDF and Syrian rebels allied to Turkey continued. The US and Turkey have \u201cmutually committed to peaceful resolution and future for the safe zone\u201d, Pence said. In return, the US will not impose further sanctions on Turkey and remove those that were imposed last week once the permanent ceasefire takes hold. The senior US delegation had travelled to Ankara with the stated task of pressuring Turkey to halt its offensive in north-east Syria or face sanctions, hours after Donald Trump said his country had no stake in defending Kurdish fighters who died by the thousands as the US\u2019s partners against Isis. On Wednesday Trump hailed his decision to withdraw US troops in Syria, paving the way for the Turkish offensive, as \u201cstrategically brilliant\u201d, declaring that the Kurds he had abandoned were \u201cmuch safer now\u201d and were anyway \u201cnot angels\u201d. His remarks not only undercut the mission to Ankara but contradicted the official assessment of both the state and defence departments that the Turkish offensive was a disaster for regional stability and the fight against Isis. In two further extraordinary developments, a bizarre letter from Trump to Erdo\u011fan emerged in which the US president warned his Turkish counterpart \u201cdon\u2019t be a fool\u201d, and a White House meeting with Democratic lawmakers descended into mutual accusations of \u201cmeltdowns\u201d. The letter was sent on 9 October \u2013 three days after a phone call in which Erdo\u011fan informed Trump of his plans, and understood the US president had given a green light. Trump issued a statement announcing the offensive was about to happen and that US troops would be moved out of the way. He also invited Erdo\u011fan to the White House. Trump wrote: \u201cHistory will look upon you favourably if you get this done the right and humane way. It will look upon you forever as the devil if good things don\u2019t happen. Don\u2019t be a tough guy. Don\u2019t be a fool!\u201d On the day the letter was received, Erdo\u011fan launched his offensive to create a buffer zone between Turkey and territory held by the SDF. The Turkish president had insisted earlier on Wednesday he would \u201cnever declare a ceasefire\u201d. While Erdo\u011fan has faced global condemnation for the operation, it is broadly popular at home, and any pathway to de-escalation probably needed to avoid embarrassing him domestically. On Wednesday, two-thirds of House Republicans supported a resolution condemning Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw troops. The vote triggered what the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, described as \u201ca meltdown\u201d by the president when she and other members of Congress visited him in the White House. Pelosi and other top Democrats said they walked out of a contentious White House meeting after it devolved into a series of insults and it became clear the president had no plan to deal with a potential revival of Isis in the Middle East.",

A mechanism to ensure this was agreed. The EU system would apply in Northern Ireland. For businesses, it is logical to have consistency, as with the single market for goods.</p> \n  <p>On consent, he says the new protocol would be supported democratically. At the end of the transition period there would be a four-year period for the new arrangements to be in force. At the end of that the members of the Northern Ireland assembly would vote, on the basis of a simple majority, for the arrangement to continue for another four years. If there were a cross-community vote in favour, it would continue for eight years. If there were a vote to end the arrangements, there would be a two-year cooling off period. </p> \n  <p>He says this new approach has nothing to do with the old backstop.

That risk exists. That is why both sides have come up with a mechanism to assess this risk. The assessment will be based on a number of criteria, overseen by a joint committee.

This should not be a surprise - Jeremy Corbyn has been saying for some time that if the country is facing either a no-deal Brexit or what he terms a damaging Tory Brexit, there should be a referendum \u2013 but in recent days there has been some uncertainty about what the party would do, because it also wants a general election ahead of a referendum.</p> \n  <p>But Lloyd said the party would back moves to subject Johnson\u2019s deal to a referendum. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If there is a majority for that deal, and if in turn there is an amendment moved, and that\u2019s put to a confirmatory vote, a public vote, then, consistent with what Labour is saying that any deal ought to go back to the public, then we are almost bound to vote for that amendment ...</p> \n   <p>It would be very hard for us to support a deal [along the lines proposed by Johnson, with employment rights in the UK potentially falling behind EU standards]. Labour doesn\u2019t have a majority in parliament. It doesn\u2019t necessarily have a blocking minority in parliament. And on that basis if Prime Minister Johnson is able to push through a deal, even a deal that we don\u2019t like, if an amendment were moved to subject that to the test of public opinion, that would be the right thing to do.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>With Labour backing a plan to put Johnson\u2019s deal to a referendum, it is possible, although not yet certain, that such an amendment could pass.</p> \n  <p>But what would happen then? It is almost impossible to imagine circumstances in which the government would agree to put the proposal to a referendum. Inside No 10, a no-deal Brexit is seen as preferable to a second referendum. And legislating for a referendum, and then having a campaign, would <a href=\"https://constitution-unit.com/2018/08/30/how-long-would-it-take-to-hold-a-second-referendum-on-brexit/\">probably take several months. </a>This suggests that, for any referendum on Johnson\u2019s plan to actually happen, opposition MPs would have to vote for some sort of interim government to replace Johnson\u2019s.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"626861d551fac2f8cdc5f0f32161977990d3fec9\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/626861d551fac2f8cdc5f0f32161977990d3fec9/0_853_1152_691/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tony Lloyd.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Lloyd.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Argles/The Guardian</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-17T08:32:28.918Z\">at 9.32am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5da81f348f0804be727991d4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-17T07:59:39.047Z\">8.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Boris Johnson speaks to Jean-Claude Juncker ahead of summit</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This is from <strong>Mina Andreeva</strong>, the European commission\u2019s chief spokeswoman.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Mina_Andreeva/status/1184736780320464896\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 Contacts between <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/EU?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#EU</a> and UK teams are continuing. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JunckerEU?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@JunckerEU</a> just spoke to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@BorisJohnson</a>.

However with three meetings in three days in Downing Street, it is unclear whether Downing Street can cede any more and ruins the prospect of a deal.</p> \n  <p>2. The EU yields to the DUP\u2019s demands. Given the EU\u2019s deep concern about how it can protect the single market from rogue goods on a border, with no border checks, it is difficult to see the EU cede further on customs.</p> \n  <p>3. The DUP folds at the last minute. Note its statement: \u201cWe will continue to work with the government to try and get a sensible deal that works for Northern Ireland and protects the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom\u201d.

Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s main events: Downing Street and Brussels announced they had reached a Brexit deal to put to the UK and European parliaments. While many Tories are expected to back the deal, the DUP has said it will not and Boris Johnson faces a fight to get it through a Commons vote. The prime minister predicted MPs would back it, despite the lack of support from the DUP. There was an effort to frame the choice facing parliamentarians as being between the prime minister\u2019s deal and no deal at all, with the European commission president seeming to rule out any delay. But the door was left ajar when EU leaders later refused to rule out a delay. The Labour leadership indicated it would not back the deal, denouncing it as worse than that negotiated by Theresa May and rejected three times by parliament. It remains to be seen whether some pro-Brexit Labour MPs will side with the prime minister. The EU\u2019s chief negotiator said there would be enough time to ratify the deal by the 31 October deadline. You can read a summary of Michel Barnier\u2019s speech here. If you\u2019d like to read yet more, my colleagues Heather Stewart, Daniel Boffey and Jennifer Rankin have the full story: Mark Field, the Tory MP for the Cities of London and Westminster, has announced he will not stand in the next general election, blaming a \u201cfractious and febrile\u201d political atmosphere. Field, who has held the seat since 2001, said in a statement to his local association he was proud of his reputation as a \u201cmoderate, consensual MP, invariably keen to work effectively across party lines to the benefit of constituents and communities alike\u201d. However, such a pragmatic, cooperative approach to public service has been tested to destruction in the fractious, febrile and deeply divisive aftermath to the EU referendum in 2016. I had dearly hoped that by the time of the next general election these issues would have been resolved. However, it is increasingly clear that divisions over Brexit and our future relationship with the EU-27 will dominate and define domestic politics for many years to come. Field was condemned by many this summer after he was filmed manhandling an environmental protester at the chancellor\u2019s Mansion House speech. The EU legislature will take its full time to carefully examine and approve any divorce deal for the UK, the European Parliament\u2019s chief Brexit official has said. Guy Verhofstadt has said the process could spill past 31 October, when the UK is currently scheduled to leave the EU. He has said MEPs will only start their work once the UK\u2019s parliament has passed a fully binding Brexit deal. If that slips past the European plenary session next week, it could well have to be picked up in the session that begins on 13 November. Any EU-UK Brexit withdrawal deal needs the official backing of both the British and European Parliaments. Verhofstadt said the parliament \u201cwill only start its work from the moment that we are 100% sure that the British Parliament will adopt this deal\u201d. The SNP\u2019s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, has been addressing his party\u2019s amendment to Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal, saying other opposition parties need to \u201cquit dithering ... and finally act to bring this appalling Tory government down and stop Brexit\u201d. Boris Johnson\u2019s appalling Brexit deal is even worse than Theresa May\u2019s. It would be devastating for Scotland \u2013 dragging us out of the EU, single market and customs union against our will, and singling Scotland out, alone of UK nations, for a raw deal, with our votes and voice ignored. The SNP will never vote for this deal, which would inflict lasting harm on jobs, living standards, public services and the economy. It is clearer than ever that the best future for Scotland is as an equal, independent European nation and the people of Scotland must be given that choice. My colleagues, Jennifer Rankin and Rowena Mason, have just published this comprehensive look at how the deal was struck and what could happen next: The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has labelled the Brexit agreement Johnson\u2019s \u201csell-out deal\u201d: Here\u2019s a little more reaction from Labour MPs: Of course, it is to the likes of Sir Kevin Barron, Rosie Cooper, Jim Fitzpatrick, Caroline Flint and John Mann \u2013 Labour MPs who have previously backed a Brexit deal in the Commons \u2013 that Johnson will look for support. It seems clear that the DUP will not only decline to support the deal, they will vote against it. This from Sky News\u2019 David Blevins and Antonello Guerrera, of Italy\u2019s la Repubblica newspaper: My colleague, Lisa O\u2019Carroll, has put together this handy explainer on what, exactly, Johnson\u2019s deal entails. The key sentence: Overall, the backstop has essentially been replaced by a full stop whereby Northern Ireland remains aligned to the EU from the end of the transition period for at least four years. Besides the motion seeking MPs\u2019 approval for the Brexit deal, a separate no-deal Brexit motion has also been tabled. But, the Press Association reports, it\u2019s understood the government did this as a contingency measure as the talks were still taking place in Brussels. Also, my colleague Rowena Mason has this: The Labour MP, Hilary Benn, has asked government to release impact assessments for Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal ahead of Saturday\u2019s vote, in a letter to the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay. And the wheels are starting to turn in Westminster: It\u2019s perhaps interesting to note that Johnson spent a not insignificant proportion of his time talking about policies one would expect to see in an election manifesto, as well as deploying the language of such a campaign, rather than about Brexit. \u201cTake back control\u201d makes an appearance, as does \u201cget Brexit done\u201d. He also refers to the planned recruitment of more police officers (though that might not be all it seems), as well as the government\u2019s living wage plans, which he says represent the \u201cbiggest expansion\u201d. Without Johnson setting out what he\u2019s actually measuring that against, it\u2019s impossible to determine whether or not it\u2019s an accurate claim. Furthermore, it\u2019s worth putting Johnson\u2019s claims about increased education funding into context. We reported back in March, for example, that teachers have been covering for canteen staff and cleaners in English schools under Tory government policy, while essential funds are raised by parent donations and \u201ccharity\u201d non-uniform days: Here\u2019s the full text of the prime minister\u2019s speech: This has been a very productive day for the UK in the sense that the European Council has approved the deal that has been negotiated over the last couple of months and I thank them very much again for their work. I particularly thank Michel Barnier and his team, I thank Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the commission, for all the personal effort that he has put into getting this deal done. I want to stress that this is a great deal for our country, for the UK. I also believe it\u2019s a very good deal for our friends in the EU. And what it means is that we in the UK can come out of the EU as one United Kingdom \u2013 England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, together. And it means we can decide our future together. We can take back control, as the phrase goes, of our money, our borders, our laws, together. And we will be able to do free trade agreements around the world. And we can also build now, after three and a half years, on our relations with our friends and partners in the EU and it will be a very exciting period now, as it were, to get to the positive side of that project; the extraction having been done, the building now begins. I am very confident that, when my colleagues in Parliament study this agreement, that they will want to vote for it on Saturday and then in succeeding days. This is our chance in the UK as democrats to get Brexit done and come out on 31 October. This is our chance to focus on our priorities, the people\u2019s priorities: the NHS; putting 20,000 police on the streets; lifting up funding of education across the country; the biggest expansion of the living wage. Those are the things I think the people of our country want us to be focusing on, in addition to Brexit. We\u2019ve been at this now, as I say, for three and a half years. It hasn\u2019t always been an easy experience for the UK. It\u2019s been long, it\u2019s been painful, it\u2019s been divisive. And now is the moment for us, as a country, to come together. Now is the moment for our parliamentarians to come together and get this thing done. And, as I say, to begin building a new and progressive partnership with our EU friends, with whom of course we share so many priorities. It\u2019s suggested that, without the support of the DUP, his predicament is similar to that of his predecessor, Theresa May. Is he not simply repeating her mistakes? Johnson replies again that it\u2019s a good deal that MPs should back. He had earlier told MPs he was \u201cvery confident\u201d that, when MPs study the Brexit deal, they would want to vote for it. The prime minister declines to say whether he\u2019ll withdraw the whip from Tory MPs who do not vote for the deal. And he avoids a question on whether he\u2019ll restore it to those from whom it was withdrawn last month. Asked how the deal will help heal Brexit divisions within the UK, Johnson says that moving on from the \u201cextraction\u201d process will allow the country to begin working on determining the nature of the relationship with the EU. The prime minister is saying that tying up the deal allows him to focus on other priorities, including putting 20,000 police officers on the streets. He has, of course, been accused of misleading the public over this policy. He says Brexit has \u201cbeen long, it\u2019s been painful and divisive\u201d and says he believes MPs will back it. Boris Johnson is starting his press conference, claiming the deal allows the whole of the UK to leave the EU together. And he says it allows the \u201cbuilding\u201d of a future relationship to begin. Here is an important point flagged up by the political commentator and broadcaster Steve Richards. Boris Johnson is about to hold a press conference. But I am finished for the day. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is taking over. Q: What compromises has the EU made? And what will happen if the UK votes against the deal? Tusk says the EU has been willing to consider compromises. He says the EU intends to work towards ratification. This was a clear decision. He says the EU is prepared for ratification, logistically and politically. He has \u201cno idea\u201d what will happen in the debate. He goes on: If there is a request for an extension, I will contact member states to see how to react. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, is speaking now. He says, after the UK leaves, the work on a new partnership will have to start. He thanks his team. He thanks his most senior officials by name. He says this deal will provide legal certainty. He says he worked on the unity of the EU27 and of the European parliament. He says he very much regrets Brexit. But he respects it. It was a sovereign choice of the UK. He says he has a Gaullist tendency. He has great respect for the UK, and he remembers what the UK did in Europe\u2019s darkest hour. He has infinite respect for the UK. In the future the UK will be there. Varadkar says the transition will last \u201cat least\u201d until the end of 2020. It could get extended. He says Ireland and the EU\u2019s objectives have been met. Citizens\u2019 rights have been protected. There will be a financial settlement. There will be no hard border. And the all-island economy will continue. He says the European council has backed this agreement unanimously. He hopes the UK parliament will now back it. Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach (PM) is speaking now. He says he has learnt two things about the EU in his two years as taoiseach. He has seen the unity of the EU, and what it can achieve if it stands together. This is a lesson for the future, he says. And he says he has felt, as leader of a small country, \u201cenormous solidarity\u201d from the EU. Sometime small states like Ireland think they will be swallowed up by an organisation like the EU. But Ireland has felt respected. He says he feels sad about Brexit. It is like an old friend going on a journey. He hopes it works out for them. But there will always be a place for the UK if it wants to come back. Varadkar says the UK will always be welcome back in the EU. Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European commission, is speaking now. He says the agreement protects the rights of citizens. The EU has always put people first, he says. He says this agreement would not have been possible without the taoiseach. He says the political declaration provides for a free trade agreement. He says he is happy they have reached a deal, but sad Brexit is happening. Donald Tusk, president of the European council, is speaking at his press conference now. He says the EU has endorsed the deal and \u201cit looks like we are very close to the final stretch\u201d. Why has a deal that looked impossible yesterday been approved? First, because it has been positively assessed by Ireland. And, second, it has been positively assessed by the European commission. He says the main change has been Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to allow customs checks between Britain and Ireland. Now we are waiting for the vote in parliament. Tusk says he feels sadness. Personally he is a remainer, and he hopes that if the UK decides to rejoin, the EU\u2019s door will be open. Tusk says he hopes one day the UK will decide to rejoin the EU. The division lists for the vote on the Letwin amendment earlier (see 1.49pm) are on the Commons website here. Only one Tory MP rebelled and supported the amendment, Dame Caroline Spelman. But nine of the 21 Tory MPs who lost the whip over a Brexit rebellion last month and who now sit as independents also voted for the amendment. Only one DUP MP voted with the government. The other nine did not. We don\u2019t know if that was a protest against the Brexit deal, but if the other nine DUP MPs had voted with the government would have lost by three, not nine. The EU27 have finished their discussion on Brexit, according to Preben Aamann, a spokesman for Donald Tusk, the president of the European council. A draft of the conclusions was leaked earlier. (See 4.14pm.) Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker are due to hold a press conference within the next half an hour. Here is one take on how the voting could go on Saturday, under various scenarios. From AFP\u2019s Dave Clark Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, devotes most of his campaigning energy at the moment to complaining that Brexit has not yet been delivered. But now that Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, is saying the EU would not allow a further Brexit deal, Farage is complaining that Juncker is overriding the Benn Act, which requires the PM to ask for an extension if his deal does not get approved. EU ministers are starting to query Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s claim that the EU would not allow a further Brexit extension. (See 2.37pm.) This is from the BBC\u2019s Nick Eardley, quoting the Danish prime minister Mette Frederiksen. And this is from the BBC\u2019s Faisal Islam, quoting Paschal Donohoe, the Irish finance minister. And these are from Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, who has been studying the revised political declaration (see 12.17pm) in detail. These are from my colleague Rowena Mason. Politico Europe\u2019s Jacopo Barigazzi has posted on Twitter a copy of a draft of the summit conclusions on Brexit. It does not say anything about whether the EU would or would not approve an extension if MPs were to vote down the deal. Instead it just invites the European commission, parliament and council \u201cto take the necessary steps to ensure that the agreement can enter into force on 1 November 2019, so as to provide for an orderly withdrawal\u201d. Here is the latest story from the summit from my colleagues Daniel Boffey, Jennifer Rankin and Heather Stewart, focusing on Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s comments. And this is how it starts. Jean-Claude Juncker has tried to help sell the new Brexit deal in the face of opposition from the Democratic Unionist party by pouring doubt on a further Brexit extension in the event of it being rejected. With Boris Johnson facing an uphill struggle to secure a majority in the Commons when it sits on Saturday, the European commission president piled pressure on MPs who fear a no-deal Brexit into giving their support. Juncker said he was \u201cruling out\u201d a prolongation, although the issue is solely the remit of the heads of state and government. \u201cIf we have a deal, we have a deal and there is no need for prolongation,\u201d he added. The claim was not repeated by any EU leaders. Donald Tusk, the European council president, confined himself to saying that \u201ca deal is always better than a no deal\u201d. Sources in Brussels suggested that previous comments from Juncker in which he had said the bloc would never choose a no-deal Brexit were a \u201cbetter reflection\u201d of the EU\u2019s position. Campaigning anti-Brexit QC Jolyon Maugham has now lodged his petition at the court of session in Edinburgh, which essentially tries to ban parliament from debating the new Brexit deal, on the basis that it is illegal, and which he anticipates will be heard tomorrow. Maugham believes that the deal contravenes s55 of the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Act 2018, which states that it is \u201cunlawful for Her Majesty\u2019s government to enter into arrangements under which Northern Ireland forms part of a separate customs territory to Great Britain\u201d. With the detail of Boris Johnson\u2019s new deal still emerging, lawyers insist that s55 is \u201ccrystal clear\u201d and that any form of differentiated deal for Northern Ireland will contravene it. So buckle up for a weekend of constitutional hijinks in Edinburgh. Remember that if Johnson refuses to sign an extension letter to the EU (should he fail to get the deal through on Saturday AND provided the court doesn\u2019t blow the whole debate out of the water) then Maugham will be back in court on Monday ... this time with his fellow petitioners, Joanna Cherry, Dale Vince, who are notably absent from today\u2019s petition. Lord Carloway, Scotland\u2019s most senior judge, has already cleared time for an emergency hearing in the court of session at noon on Monday 21 October, where he could issue court orders forcing Johnson to send a letter to the EU asking for an extension to article 50 until 31 January as per the Benn act. This is from Sir Craig Oliver, David Cameron\u2019s former communications chief. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, welcomed the Brexit deal as he arrived at the EU summit earlier, but stressed that it still had to get through the UK and EU parliaments. \u201cBased on past experience we have to be reasonably cautious,\u201d he said. From Reuters\u2019 Luke Baker Here is Katya Adler, the BBC\u2019s Europe editor, on Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s comments. Manufacturing Northern Ireland has given a \u201cguarded welcome\u201d the Brexit agreement saying it \u201cremoves the risk of a catastrophic no deal\u201d but raises concerns about the administrative and financial burden on the new arrangements that will apply on some trade into Northern Ireland. If it is approved, expect Northern Ireland business to be looking for substantial help on both points \u2013 the paperwork and costs \u2013 from London. Stephen Kelly, Manufacturing NI\u2019s chief executive, said: What is good is that a deal is struck, we can move on to the more positive conversation about the future relationship and regardless Northern Ireland can continue to have tariff free, quota free access to both the UK and the EU\u2019s single market. More on the significance of Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s comments about the EU not agreeing to a further Brexit extension. These are from Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall. And this is from the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith. This is what Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European commission, said about ruling out a Brexit extension. He was speaking to reporters on the \u201cred carpet\u201d where leaders speak to journalists as they arrive for the summit. Asked if he thought the deal would pass parliament, he said: \u201cIt has to.\u201d Then he added: Anyway, there will be no prolongation. He went on: We have concluded a deal. So there is not an argument for delay. It has to be done now. Asked by another journalist if he would rule out an extension if Boris Johnson asked for that, Juncker replied: I gave a brief doorstop with Boris Johnson ... half an hour ago and I was ruling out that there will be any kind of prolongation. If we have a deal, we have a deal, and there is no need for prolongation. That is not only the British view; that is my view too. Asked again if he would officially rule out an extension, he replied: Yes. We have a deal. So why should we have a prolongation? But, as my colleague Jennifer Rankin points out, it is questionable whether, in practice, the EU27 would rule out another extension if the alternative were no deal. Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, has said the EU will not grant another Brexit extension. This is hugely significant because, if the EU27 agree \u2013 and it is not clear yet whether he is speaking on their behalf \u2013 it means MPs will effectively be faced with a choice between this deal and no deal. Sinn Fein has welcomed Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal. In a statement its president, Mary Lou McDonald, said: I welcome the fact that an agreement has been reached between the European Union and the British government. There is no such thing as a good Brexit. Brexit is being foisted on the north of Ireland against the democratic wishes of the people. As a party, Sinn F\u00e9in has worked to defend Irish interests from the worst impacts of Brexit. It was Sinn F\u00e9in who first made the case for a \u2018designated special status for the north within the EU\u2019 and it was Sinn F\u00e9in who insisted on the protection of the Good Friday agreement and no hard border on the island of Ireland as bottom lines. We have also insisted that no veto can be given to unionism. But she also said any deal was a \u201cleast worst option\u201d that would \u201conly mitigate the worst effects of Brexit\u201d. Boris Johnson has just given a brief statement to the press at the EU summit alongside Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president. Juncker said the deal was fair and balanced. He said: This is a fair, a balanced agreement. It is testament to our commitment to finding solutions. It provides certainty where Brexit creates uncertainty. And Johnson said this was a very good deal for both sides. He said: I do think this deal represents a very good deal for the EU and the UK. I think it is a reasonable, fair outcome and reflects the large amount of work undertaken by both sides ... I agree very much with Jean-Claude about what he said about protecting the peace process on the island of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Of course, for us in the UK it means we can deliver a real Brexit that achieves our objectives. It means the UK leaves whole and entire on 31 October and it means that Northern Ireland and every part of the UK can take part in not just free trade deals, offering our tariffs, exporting our goods around the world, but it also means we can take, together as a single United Kingdom, decisions about our future - our laws, our borders, our money and how we want to run the UK. Those decisions will be taken in the UK by elected representatives of the people in the UK. The government has lost the first vote on the Saturday sitting. Sir Oliver Letwin\u2019s amendment (see 1.29pm) was passed by 287 votes to 275 \u2013 a majority of 12. Explaining his amendment in the debate Letwin said this would allow the government motion on Saturday to be amended. He implied it would allow MPs to insist on Boris Johnson requesting an extension anyway, and only withdrawing that request when the legislation for his deal has passed. The purpose of the amendment here is very simple, it is to permit amendments to be moved, if selected by [the Speaker], on Saturday, and be voted upon. And that will enable those of us, like me, who wish to support and carry through and eventually see the ratification of this deal, not to put us in the position of allowing the government off the Benn act hook on Saturday, but only at a time when the bill has been taken through both Houses of Parliament and legislated on. Letwin was referring to a loophole in the Benn act which means Johnson only has to send a letter requesting an extension if MPs fail to pass a motion backing a deal by Saturday. In theory they could pass that motion, but then fail to pass the withdrawal agreement legislation, which would mean the UK leaving without a deal on 31 October. The Letwin amendment should also make it possible for MPs to table an amendment saying Johnson\u2019s deal should be subject to a second referendum. (See 9.13am.) After the vote on the amendment, the motion as amended was approved without a vote. Iain Duncan Smith, the Tory Brexiter and former party leader, told the BBC\u2019s Daily Politics that he had not decided yet whether he would vote for this deal. As the BBC reports, he explained: I want to know how quickly can we get to a free trade agreement, how quickly can we therefore get out, what incentive is there for the EU to do this quickly? And is the political declaration exclusively for free trade? MPs are now voting on the motion to sit on Saturday. In the Commons MPs are now debating the government business motion saying they sit on Saturday. Opening the debate Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, said that Boris Johnson would make a statement to MPs on Saturday about the new Brexit agreement. Only after that statement would MPs start the debate on it. Rees-Mogg said MPs would then vote either on a motion to back the deal or on one to approve no deal. He explained: The debate that follows will be a motion to either approve a deal or to approve a no-deal exit. That debate on one or other of those motions would run for up to 90 minutes under the existing rules of this house. In the event of a motion to approve a deal, that motion, if passed, will meet the terms both of the European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act [aka, the Benn act] and of section 13 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act. The government has not published the motion it is tabling for Saturday. The debate is scheduled to last 90 minutes. Sir Oliver Letwin, the Tory former cabinet minister who has been leading efforts to ensure MPs block a no-deal Brexit, has tabled an amendment to the business motion allowing the debate on Saturday to last longer and also allowing more amendments to be put to a vote. Rees-Mogg claimed that the Letwin amendment could actually shorten the debate because, if Johnson\u2019s statement went on for hours, under the Letwin procedure there would be less than 90-minutes left for the main debate. But John Bercow, the Speaker, contradicted Rees-Mogg. He said he had the discretion to allow the debate to over-run and he said there was \u201cno way on Earth\u201d he would let it be shortened in the way Rees-Mogg was suggesting. Here is the key extract from the DUP\u2019s statement. These arrangements will become the settled position in these areas for Northern Ireland. This drives a coach and horses through the professed sanctity of the Belfast agreement. For all of these reasons it is our view that these arrangements would not be in Northern Ireland\u2019s long-term interests. Saturday\u2019s vote in parliament on the proposals will only be the start of a long process to get any withdrawal agreement bill through the House of Commons. The DUP has just issued this statement. Here is the text of Michel Barnier\u2019s opening statement at his press conference earlier. And here are the key points from the opening and the Q&amp;A. Barnier said that the new deal could be ratified before 31 October. That would be necessary for Boris Johnson to be able to fulfil his pledge to take the UK out of the EU on 31 October. Barnier stressed that the agreement was only a draft, and that it would not be ratified at the summit today. But he also said: I am confident [the agreement] can be supported and ratified in the time between now and 31 October. He confirmed that the DUP would not have a veto on whether the new arrangements for Northern Ireland came into force. (See 11.16am.) Explaining what the agreement now says about the issue of consent, which is different from what Johnson was proposing earlier this month, Barnier said: Four years after the entry into force of the protocol, the elected representatives of Northern Ireland will be able to decide, by simple majority, whether to continue applying relevant Union rules in Northern Ireland or not. He said Johnson told Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, he was confident MPs would pass his deal. Barnier said: Mr Johnson said to President Juncker this morning he has faith in his ability to convince the majority he needs in the House of Commons. He said, based on this agreement and the explanations he intends to give, he has confidence in his ability to win that vote. Barnier refused to speculate on whether the EU would be willing to make a fresh offer to the UK if MPs voted down this plan. From Bloomberg\u2019s Kitty Donaldson A view in Northern Ireland is that the DUP have been totally shafted, or \u201crun over by a convoy of juggernauts\u201d, and for once lost out in their hallmark brinkmanship. This could rise to further tensions in the region, making it vital that there is \u201cno crowing in Dublin\u201d, one source said. The DUP, which had been the lynchpin in Theresa May\u2019s government, have seen their powerful position rubbed out this morning in Brussels and some in Northern Ireland are saying they believe that this was Boris Johnson\u2019s calculation all along: get a deal and have a general election whether he gets it through parliament or not. \u201cThis has not gone well for the DUP. This is a huge moment for the DUP, and it is going to create huge tensions on the unionist side. Northern Ireland continues to be collateral damage in Brexit,\u201d said the source. Some believe that the DUP\u2019s statement this morning was about forcing further concessions from Boris Johnson. But the moment the deal was done the door was closed in their face. That said it may well be that Johnson lavishes the DUP/Northern Ireland with a jacuzzi of cash in the next two days to bring them back on board. The Northern Ireland secretary, Julian Smith, was in Derry recently to discuss the establishment of a new medical school and there has been repeated talk of money for a motorway from Derry to Belfast. But sources say \u201cthis is of no interest to the DUP because that is Sinn F\u00e9in territory\u201d. So if the DUP have been sold a dummy pass, how did that happen? Could Dominic Cummings have come up with a cunning plan to persuade them to drop regulatory alignment in exchange for a veto on the deal, a veto that he knew would never get through? That is a question yet to be answered. Others point out that the DUP took a huge step agreeing to yield on regulatory alignment with the EU and this was not matched by the EU/Dublin. They felt that this was not recognised by Dublin and they were \u201cvery annoyed\u201d when Leo Varadkar made an off-the-cuff remark in Sweden days later that the British public actually wanted to stay in the EU but it was politically impossible. Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister in charge of no-deal planning, told Sky News that this deal was not a betrayal of the DUP. Asked if the government had thrown the DUP under the bus, he replied: \u201cAbsolutely not, this is a great deal.\u201d Asked what would happen if MPs rejected the deal on Saturday, he said: \u201cWe don\u2019t contemplate defeat.\u201d Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, says the new deal does not amount to proper Brexit. Here is the revised text of the political declaration (pdf). It runs to 27 pages. And here is some comment on it from journalists and other commentators From ITV\u2019s Joel Hills From Stuart Wood, a Labour peer and former EU adviser to Gordon Brown From Sam Lowe from the Centre for European Reform From MLex\u2019s Matthew Holehouse From Politics.co.uk\u2019s Ian Dunt This is from Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby. These are from my colleague Rajeev Syal, who was at the No 10 lobby briefing. Q: What happens if the Northern Ireland assembly wants to stop accepting EU rules? And what is the solution on VAT? On VAT, Barnier says an agreement was reached overnight. There was an issue with the need for consistency on VAT rates. A mechanism to ensure this was agreed. The EU system would apply in Northern Ireland. For businesses, it is logical to have consistency, as with the single market for goods. On consent, he says the new protocol would be supported democratically. At the end of the transition period there would be a four-year period for the new arrangements to be in force. At the end of that the members of the Northern Ireland assembly would vote, on the basis of a simple majority, for the arrangement to continue for another four years. If there were a cross-community vote in favour, it would continue for eight years. If there were a vote to end the arrangements, there would be a two-year cooling off period. He says this new approach has nothing to do with the old backstop. It sets up a system in Northern Ireland that is sustainable. It is linked to regular, democratic verification. There is ownership of this in Northern Ireland. We now must place our trust in the system, he says. And that\u2019s it. The press conference is over. Q: The UK authorities will be able to apply their own tariffs, as long as there is no risk of goods entering the single market. How will that be established? Barnier says there is a possibility that goods arriving from GB, or from a third country via GB, might not stay in the customs territory of NI. That risk exists. That is why both sides have come up with a mechanism to assess this risk. The assessment will be based on a number of criteria, overseen by a joint committee. What is the destination of the goods? Are they consumer goods or industrial goods? What is the value of the goods? What is the risk of an infringement? Q: What was key turning point in the last week? Barnier says the taoiseach had a special responsibility. The Irish government is a co-guarantor of the Good Friday agreement. He met Boris Johnson in Liverpool. And after that meeting the UK and the EU were able to make headway. They agreed there would be no customs checks in Ireland or Northern Ireland. He says this new solution must be sustainable. Q: If this does not get through parliament, is this as far as the EU goes? Barnier says that is a hypothetical question. He says Boris Johnson thinks it will pass. He says he has always avoided talking on the basis of emotion and passion. He works on the basis of fact and objectivity. He has looked for practical solutions to the problems posed by Brexit. He says in Northern Ireland a joint committee will have a mandate. This is a balanced agreement, he says. He says it is \u201cthe best possible one\u201d. The backstop has been replaced with a new approach. This justifies the consent procedure, he says. He says this is a dynamic compromise between the UK and the EU. Q: Did you get an assurance that Johnson would get a majority for this? Barnier says, when Boris Johnson spoke to Jean-Claude Juncker this morning, he presumes Johnson had faith in his ability to get a majority. He has said he has confidence in his ability to win the vote. Boris Johnson has said he is confident he can get his deal through parliament, says Barnier. Q: MPs have voted against a deal three times. Has Boris Johnson assured you he can get this through? Barnier says he has some experience here. That is why is is being \u201ccautious\u201d. The House of Commons will have to take its decision. Barnier says he was an MP. He knows what it means to be a parliamentarian. He says the agreement is \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d, to use Boris Johnson\u2019s words. (See 10.36am.) He says has never wanted to give a commentary on British political debate. Q: Can the deal be ratified at this summit? Or will there need to be another one? Barnier says there will be \u201cno ratification at the council\u201d today. The council will be able to give a favourable opinion on the recommendation, and on the draft agreement. It is a draft, he stresses. He says the council has to formally agree the agreement after the European parliament has ratified it. He says there should be \u201cno surprises\u201d here. He says he has done what he has done to ensure member states are well informed. He says he believes it can be ratified by 31 October. Barnier says the text of the agreement is now available. It is here (pdf) - all 64 pages of it. These are the revisions to the withdrawal agreement. The rest of the agreement as negotiated by Theresa May still stands. Barnier switches to speaking in English (he was speaking in French) and turns to the one aspect of the agreement the UK wanted to reopen \u2013 the backstop. He says the EU wanted to keep the border open, preserve the all-island economy and protect the integrity of the single market. And it was important for Boris Johnson to keep NI in the UK customs territory. He says the talks have \u201cat times been difficult\u201d. But they have a deal, with four parts. First, EU regulations will apply to all goods in Northern Ireland. This means checks at the border. Second, NI will remain in the UK\u2019s customs territory. It will therefore benefit from UK trade policy. But it will remain an entry point into the single market. So UK authorities will apply UK tariffs to countries coming from third countries as long as goods entering NI are not at risk of entering the single market. If they are at risk of entering the single market, EU tariffs will apply. Third, on VAT, the plan will maintain the integrity of the single market, while respecting the UK\u2019s digital wishes. And, fourth, there will be a consent mechanism. Four years after the arrangements starts, the Northern Ireland assembly will decide by a simple majority if these arrangements stay. Barnier confirms that the DUP will lose its veto on whether the new arrangements come into force. Under the plan proposed by Boris Johnson earlier this month, the new plan for NI would only have taken affect subject to a vote in the assembly \u2013 which the DUP would have been able to veto. Barnier says the transition will last until the end of 2020. But it could last another year or two years, if there is joint agreement. Barnier says citizens have always been, and will remain, the EU\u2019s priority. Uncertainty for them has been going on for too long, he says. There is also certainty for groups getting funding from the EU budget. That is because financial commitments made by the EU28 will be honoured by the EU28. He says there is more certainty for businesses. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, is holding a press conference now. He says the EU has built its position together. The agreement has been agreed. Boris Johnson will present it to the EU27 later at the summit. He says the text should provide \u201clegal certainty\u201d, especially for citizens. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has issued this statement about the UK-EU Brexit deal. He said: From what we know, it seems the prime minister has negotiated an even worse deal than Theresa May\u2019s, which was overwhelmingly rejected. These proposals risk triggering a race to the bottom on rights and protections: putting food safety at risk, cutting environmental standards and workers\u2019 rights, and opening up our NHS to a takeover by US private corporations. This sell-out deal won\u2019t bring the country together and should be rejected. The best way to get Brexit sorted is to give the people the final say in a public vote. This is from my colleague Jennifer Rankin in Brussels. From ITV\u2019s Robert Peston From the Times\u2019 Steven Swinford From Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby Yesterday my colleagues Kate Proctor and Rowena Mason looked at Boris Johnson\u2019s chances of getting his Brexit deal through the Commons. The numbers make it look difficult. But the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth explains how Johnson significantly boost his chances of winning. Here are extracts from the letter from Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European commission, to Donald Tusk, president of the European council. (See 10.38am.) As regards the withdrawal agreement itself, negotiations focused on the protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland [ie, the backstop] and sought to identify a mutually satisfactory solution to address the specific circumstances on the island of Ireland. The negotiators also discussed the political declaration setting out the framework for the future relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom. Their aim was to adjust the political declaration in a way that reflects the different level of ambition now sought by the government of the United Kingdom for the country\u2019s future relationship with the European Union ... I believe it is high time to complete the withdrawal process and move on, as swiftly as possible, to the negotiation on the European Union\u2019s future partnership with the United Kingdom. The pound has just surged through $1.29 against the US dollar, hitting a new five-month high. Shares in UK housebuilders and banks are also rallying, as investors welcome the news that a Brexit deal has been agreed. From Sky\u2019s David Blevins That is a reference to the statement issued this morning. See 8.26am. And Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, has also confirmed that a deal has been agreed. He has posted this on Twitter. This is from Boris Johnson. From RTE\u2019s Tony Connelly The Brussels press pack are all picking up the same message. From the Times\u2019 Brussels correspondent Bruno Waterfield. From the Telegraph\u2019s Brussels correspondent James Crisp From my colleague Jennifer Rankin From my colleague Daniel Boffey The Jacob Rees-Mogg business statement will now start after 11am (see 10.05am) because there is an urgent question for age verification for pornographic websites first. It is hard to be sure what will happen in Brussels today, because there seems to be considerable uncertainty as to how the day will play out. But here is the schedule for Brexit-related events in London and Brussels as things stand now. 10.30am: Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, makes a business statement in the Commons. After 11.30am: MPs debate the motion for the Commons to sit on Saturday. They will also consider an amendment to it tabled by Sir Oliver Letwin designed to stop the government limiting voting on amendments on the Saturday. From 12.30pm: EU leaders start arriving for the EU summit in Brussels. 2.30pm: The summit starts. Brexit is expected to be the first item on the agenda. 3.15pm: David Sassoli, president of the European parliament, is due to hold a press conference. Around 6pm: Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, and Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European commission, are expected to hold a press conference. These are from RTE\u2019s Tony Connelly in Brussels. As a columnist on the Daily Telegraph Boris Johnson was notorious for always filing his column at the very last moment - often beyond what he had been told was the final deadline. It now seems that the EU is getting much the same treatment. This is from Sam McBride, political editor of the News Letter in Belfast on the DUP statement. (See 8.26am.) More from my colleague Daniel Boffey in Brussels These are from the Telegraph\u2019s Brussels correspondent James Crisp. From my colleague Daniel Boffey From Reuters On the Today programme Tony Lloyd, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, has confirmed that Labour would push for a referendum on Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal. This should not be a surprise - Jeremy Corbyn has been saying for some time that if the country is facing either a no-deal Brexit or what he terms a damaging Tory Brexit, there should be a referendum \u2013 but in recent days there has been some uncertainty about what the party would do, because it also wants a general election ahead of a referendum. But Lloyd said the party would back moves to subject Johnson\u2019s deal to a referendum. He said: If there is a majority for that deal, and if in turn there is an amendment moved, and that\u2019s put to a confirmatory vote, a public vote, then, consistent with what Labour is saying that any deal ought to go back to the public, then we are almost bound to vote for that amendment ... It would be very hard for us to support a deal [along the lines proposed by Johnson, with employment rights in the UK potentially falling behind EU standards]. Labour doesn\u2019t have a majority in parliament. It doesn\u2019t necessarily have a blocking minority in parliament. And on that basis if Prime Minister Johnson is able to push through a deal, even a deal that we don\u2019t like, if an amendment were moved to subject that to the test of public opinion, that would be the right thing to do. With Labour backing a plan to put Johnson\u2019s deal to a referendum, it is possible, although not yet certain, that such an amendment could pass. But what would happen then? It is almost impossible to imagine circumstances in which the government would agree to put the proposal to a referendum. Inside No 10, a no-deal Brexit is seen as preferable to a second referendum. And legislating for a referendum, and then having a campaign, would probably take several months. This suggests that, for any referendum on Johnson\u2019s plan to actually happen, opposition MPs would have to vote for some sort of interim government to replace Johnson\u2019s. This is from Mina Andreeva, the European commission\u2019s chief spokeswoman. Speaking to the German parliament this morning, Angela Merkel, the chancellor, said she did not know whether the EU summit would conclude with a Brexit deal. But Europe would never allow violence to return to Ireland, she said. She told her MPs: There has been movement in recent days, significant movement ... so we are on a better path than before but, today I must say very clearly, we have not reached the goal yet. So I cannot say today how the European council will end tomorrow. But I can say that we will not allow hate and violence to flare up on the island of Ireland again. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay has arrived at 10 Downing Street, and did not respond to questions about securing an exit deal, the Press Association reports. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Nadeem Badshah. Here is the full text of the DUP statement issued earlier. It was sent out as a statement from Arlene Foster, the party leader, and Nigel Dodds, her deputy. They said: We have been involved in ongoing discussions with the government. As things stand, we could not support what is being suggested on customs and consent issues and there is a lack of clarity on VAT. We will continue to work with the government to try and get a sensible deal that works for Northern Ireland and protects the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom. The housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, said we knew the negotiations were going to be difficult and would go down to the line, but the government is \u201cworking very intensively... to try and secure a deal\u201d. Asked whether the prime minister would meet with the DUP today, Jenrick told BBC Breakfast: I don\u2019t know the exact arrangements for the next few hours, but be assured the prime minister and his team are in intensive negotiations with all parties, including with the DUP. We want to provide sufficient comfort for the DUP and unionists in Northern Ireland to feel that the arrangements we would put in place with this deal are sufficient to give them comfort to support it. We know there are clearly concerns on the part of the DUP and we want to try and work through these productively in the hours to come. All sides in this do want to secure an orderly exit from the EU, and I think one is in sight, although there is clearly very significant issues to be hammered out. Let\u2019s wait and see. More from Tom the painter in Athens \u201cIn the beginning there was Boris, then there was God. Gen II\u201d: Not long after Greece\u2019s own eurozone drama, graffiti appears in Athens, in the Plaka district beneath the Acropolis, immortalising the man who might save Britain from Brexit - described as a one-way street in the second picture. Greece, which adopted punishing austerity to remain in the eurozone (and by extension the EU) has been watching the Brexit drama with thinly-veiled dismay. The Guardian\u2019s Greek correspondent Helena Smith can reveal that Tom, the painter of these works of art, is an Irishman who has long lived in the Plaka district. The DUP\u2019s statement makes clear the party cannot support the deal as it stands, but it is not closing the door completely so could be read as a final prod to Michel Barnier to compromise on the customs arrangements, consent and give more clarity on the very tricky issue of VAT. Three routes open up from this: 1. Boris Johnson compromises more. However with three meetings in three days in Downing Street, it is unclear whether Downing Street can cede any more and ruins the prospect of a deal. 2. The EU yields to the DUP\u2019s demands. Given the EU\u2019s deep concern about how it can protect the single market from rogue goods on a border, with no border checks, it is difficult to see the EU cede further on customs. 3. The DUP folds at the last minute. Note its statement: \u201cWe will continue to work with the government to try and get a sensible deal that works for Northern Ireland and protects the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom\u201d. This is leaving the door open to further changes today. It is worth remembering that the DUP is the party that says no. \u201cNo surrender\u201d was its slogan in its heyday when it was led by its bombastic founder, the now deceased Ian Paisley. It is also worth remembering that it did not support the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement in 1998. And we know what happened there. The pound fell 0.5 per cent against the dollar and the euro within minutes of the announcement by the DUP just before 7am that the party cannot support the Brexit deal as it currently stands. A pound was worth 1.2759 dollars and 1.1525 euros. If you are wondering what exactly is in the deal, our Brussels correspondent Jennifer Rankin got a briefing last night. There is a potentially pivotal day ahead with the EU summit ahead of Saturday\u2019s deadline to prevent a delay to Brexit. Boris Johnson is on his way to Brussels this morning. Our Brexit correspondent Lisa O\u2019Carroll on the DUP\u2019s decision. Good morning everyone. More reaction to the DUP\u2019s statement. That\u2019s it from me, I\u2019m handing over to my colleague Nadeem Badshah. The DUP has issued a statement from Arlene Foster and Nigel Dodds saying that \u201cas things stand, we could not support what is being suggested on customs and consent issues and there is a lack of clarity on VAT. \u201cWe will continue to work with the Government to try and get a sensible deal that works for Northern Ireland and protects the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom.\u201d For those of you who missed this, late last night Louise Ellman, Labour MP for Liverpool Riverside, announced she was leaving the Labour Party because she could \u201cno longer advocate voting Labour when it risks Corbyn becoming PM\u201d. Dame Louise, 73, who is Jewish, said she had been \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by the \u201cgrowth of anti-Semitism\u201d in Labour in recent years. She told the Times newspaper that if he became prime minister \u201cI believe that Jeremy Corbyn would be a danger to the country, a danger to the Jewish community as well, but a danger to the country too\u201d. Lord Adonis is up and tweeting early, as he often does. He is reiterating his view that Johnson will end up being forced to ask the EU for an extension beyond 31 October. How the papers covered it A photograph of Boris Johnson walking behind a metal fence, which gives the unfortunate impression that the prime minster was behind bars, provided a visual metaphor too good for most publications to pass up and it is the lead image on most of the front pages. The Telegraph really pushes the image, its slightly baffling headline is: \u201cBrexit is like the Shawshank Redemption... but now we can see the light\u201d. The Daily Express has: \u201cAgainst all odds, Boris closes in on Brexit deal\u201d, the Times reports: \u201cBrexit deal on knife edge as DUP blocks Johnson\u201d, the Mail says: \u201cIn sight of the summit\u201d, the Guardian has: \u201cJohnson in last-minute scramble for DUP backing\u201d, the Mirror goes with: \u201cBrexit on a knife-edge\u201d, the i\u2019s splash is: \u201cDeadlock on Brexit deal ahead of summit\u201d. Boris Johnson is in a race against time to secure the Democratic Unionist party\u2019s backing for his newly negotiated Brexit deal as EU leaders said they were ready to approve the agreement on Thursday if the prime minister succeeds. Plans to publish a full legal text ahead of the leaders\u2019 summit had to be put on hold to the frustration of EU officials after the DUP raised a series of objections to the tentative agreement. With time short, Johnson told a meeting of Conservative MPs he was hopeful of a deal but it felt like he was on the Hillary Step of Mount Everest while the summit was \u201cshrouded in mist\u201d. The prime minister appeared to have the party\u2019s hardline Eurosceptics onboard, including Steve Baker, who said Johnson had briefed them that the whole of the UK was leaving the customs union. But they also added a note of caution that they could not vote for any Brexit deal without seeing a legal text. The 21 former Tory MPs who have recently lost their whip could also rebel. An issue over VAT was said by Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, to be a last-minute obstacle in the negotiations when he briefed European ambassadors on Wednesday night. But the British objection was described by EU diplomats as a \u201cBritish smokescreen\u201d to give Downing Street more time to win over the DUP\u2019s leader, Arlene Foster. Good (very early!) morning to everyone. We\u2019re up with the sparrows because there is talk that Boris Johnson might make an early-morning dash to Brussels to get his Brexit deal done. This would require the support of the Democratic Unionist Party, who have raised serious concerns with the deal. But, if the DUP come around and agree to support the deal, Johnson can then take it back to EU leaders who are meeting in Brussels today, who have said they will give political agreement to it during their summit. They will still need to have the text scrutinised before giving formal approval and it also remains to be seen whether the UK parliament will agree to the deal on Saturday, when they are sitting to vote on the potential deal. No one knows what will happen and we\u2019ve all been round the Brexit deal merry-go-round more times we care to remember, but there\u2019s a sense that today could be a BIG MOMENT in this journey. I will be shepherding us all through the Brexit news for the first few hours before I hand over to my colleagues, who will take you through the rest of the day.

Top stories The US vice-president, Mike Pence, and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, have agreed a five-day ceasefire in northern Syria, allowing Kurdish troops to withdraw before a proposed permanent ceasefire. By suspending Ankara\u2019s operation on Kurdish-led forces, it is expected significant bloodshed will be prevented, with Donald Trump tweeting: \u201cMillions of lives will be saved.\u201d The agreement will see Syrian defence forces pull back from Turkey\u2019s proposed 32km \u201csafe zone\u201d along its border. In return, the US will not impose further economic sanctions on Turkey. It\u2019s not clear if Kurdish officials were involved in negotiations, while Syria and Russia are yet to comment. Farmers prosecuted for illegal land clearing have alleged a former NSW minister gave them tacit permission to do so, with the previous member for Barwon, Kevin Humphries, reportedly telling landowners the laws were about to change allowing them to clear native vegetation with impunity. Humphries had previously denied making the statements to the ABC. An area equivalent to the size of 100 Sydney central business districts was cleared in north-west NSW in 2017-18, a threefold increase since 2014-15. Labor shares Asio\u2019s assessment of an increased risk of rightwing extremist violence, with Anne Aly, a former academic who specialised in counter-terrorism, urging the federal government to commit more resources to the problem. \u201cOn Australian soil we have seen reports of escalating and brazen extremist white supremacist activity,\u201d the member for Cowan warned, calling on counter-terrorism agencies to be given more material support to monitor and evaluate people\u2019s public online behaviour. The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, played down the concerns, telling reporters that Asio\u2019s funding \u201cgoes up every year\u201d. Nearly three years after Raymond Noel Lindsay Thomas died during a police chase a coronial inquest will begin, to determine how it was the six-foot-eight-inch Aboriginal man affectionately known as \u201cBig Raymond\u201d came to be involved in a high-speed crash. With GPS data allegedly contradicting the police\u2019s official report, the coroner will need to determine how and why the police pursuit occurred. The policy governing pursuit protocols was tightened in 2015 but expanded again in early 2017 after a driver killed five pedestrians in Melbourne\u2019s Bourke Street mall. World The Catalan president has blamed \u201cinfiltrators\u201d for violent protests across the region, after 80 people, including 46 police officers, were injured overnight as cars were set alight and molotov cocktails were thrown. Incompatible statements out of Europe have sent a blow to Boris Johnson\u2019s hopes of a 31 October Brexit, after the European Commission president Jean-Claude Junker\u2019s \u201cruling out\u201d of any further extension was contradicted by the European Council president, Donald Tusk. A vocal critic of Hungary\u2019s far-right President Viktor Orb\u00e1n has been elected mayor of Budapest, vowing to cooperate with other mayors in a more pro-European fashion. Gergely Kar\u00e1csony\u2019s election is the first electoral setback for Orb\u00e1n in more than a decade. A sixth US official has given evidence at impeachment hearings against Donald Trump, with the ambassador to the EU, Gordon Sondland, claiming that the president instructed diplomats to work with Rudy Giuliani in investigating Joe Biden. Angry rush-hour Tube commuters have clashed with Extinction Rebellion protesters, with passengers dragging one activist from the roof of a Jubilee line train. Police arrested eight people for the stunt, which has been criticised for damaging goodwill towards the movement. Opinion and analysis For more than six decades the films of Ken Loach have challenged norms and shone a searing light on social injustice. From his Palme d\u2019Or winning epic The Wind That Shakes the Barley to his cinematographically beautiful \u201cultimate misfit story\u201d Kes, Loach has directed films that invite the viewer to shift in their seat. But they\u2019ve not all hit the mark, writes Andrew Pulver, who offers a definitive list of the veteran director\u2019s prodigious output, from stinker to classic. While boomers and millennials engage in decades of tedious generational warfare, Gen X are getting off the hook, writes Brigid Delaney. Once seen as grungy Nirvana-loving counter-culturals, the generation of Boris Johnson and Scott Morrison have flown under the radar. \u201cThis invisibility has so far meant that blame for the climate emergency has not been directed at Xers. But that is changing.\u201d Neutered protest movements, cheap flights, big houses, and constant distraction may have seen Gen X fall asleep at the wheel, but Gen Z are picking up the baton with a new zeal.

      "body": "<p>The 28 Eurosceptic Tory hardliners have not said \u201cno\u201d to Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal, giving No 10 hope that they will swing behind the prime minister.</p> <p>The group, known as \u201cthe Spartans\u201d, had indicated they would take a lead from the Democratic Unionist party, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/17/rival-unionists-accuse-dup-of-catastrophic-brexit-miscalculation\">categorically said it would vote against Johnson\u2019s deal</a>. But several of the Tory hardliners \u2013 from Peter Bone to Andrew Bridgen \u2013 suggested they were likely to vote for the agreement.</p> <p>It was not unanimous, however, as the European Research Group\u2019s steering committee, made up of senior MPs and former ministers, met on Thursday for a \u201cdeep discussion\u201d about the new agreement, which they went through line by line.</p> <p>\u201cThere were a lot of mixed views. This vote will cause some agony for some members, but it will be up to each member\u2019s conscience,\u201d said a source.</p> <p>Particular sticking points included the role of the European courts of justice in solving disputes \u2013 \u201cWhy can\u2019t it be the supreme court?\u201d said one member \u2013 and the failure to give the DUP a veto.</p> <p>\u201cWe have stood with the DUP for so long that for some members it will be painful to choose,\u201d said another.</p> <p>But even some of the most fervent Brexiters, including Steve Baker and Mark Francois, made positive noises about the settlement, saying there were \u201climited remaining concerns\u201d. Owen Paterson, the former Northern Ireland secretary and another hardliner, also did not rule out backing it.</p> <p>Another hard Brexiter, Sir Bernard Jenkin, said: \u201cIt looks very much better than [Theresa] May\u2019s deal, but I am going to read the details very carefully before deciding.\u201d</p> <p>The ERG will hold an emergency meeting on Saturday morning before going to the chamber for the vote.</p> <p>With many of them considering backing the deal, there were signs of discontent on the other wing of the Tory party, among former remainers and softer Brexiters. Oliver Letwin, a former Conservative who lost the whip, said he would be voting for the \u201cadmirable\u201d deal, but also signed a letter, along with David Gauke, the former justice secretary, demanding to see an impact assessment first.</p> <p>Some of the other former Conservatives who lost the whip were anxious not to be rushed into voting for a hard deal without proper scrutiny. There were also worries that voting for a deal could open the door to the Eurosceptics backing out at a later date, when the withdrawal agreement returns for a second reading, to cause a no-deal crash-out on 31 October. To mitigate the risk of this, there was talk on Thursday night of a cross-party amendment to force Johnson into a Brexit extension if the withdrawal agreement bill was voted down at a later stage in order to wreck it.</p> <p>At the same time, a number of pro-deal opposition MPs were agonising over whether to vote for the deal. Special advisers were tasked with contacting key Labour MPs on Thursday. Johnson himself is expected to begin calling round wavering ERG MPs and Labour MPs with large leave votes on Friday, Downing Street sources said.</p> <p>Labour MPs were coming under huge pressure from colleagues not to back a Johnson-led deal, but Ruth Smeeth, MP for Stoke-on-Trent North, said: \u201cI\u2019ve been quite clear publicly since April, I want to vote for a deal. It is my intention to vote for a deal unless [Johnson] has completely undermined workers\u2019 rights, environmental rights and consumer rights.\u201d</p> <p>But there was silence from many of the other pro-deal opposition MPs, including those who signed a letter telling the EU they wanted to vote for an agreement, such as Stephen Kinnock and Sarah Champion.</p> <p>One MP said: \u201cWhatever I say I will probably be met with a shower of abuse from one side or the other. I\u2019m still undecided whether to support the deal, which in many ways is less attractive than Theresa May\u2019s deal, but I have to think of the counterfactual, which is dangerous and risky.\u201d</p> <p>Jim Fitzpatrick, the Labour MP for Limehouse and Poplar, said he voted for May\u2019s deal and he would do the same with Johnson\u2019s agreement, but he said many of his colleagues had not decided. He said up to 20 Labour MPs could back a deal but said the fact it was Johnson made it harder to vote for than an agreement put forward by May.</p> <p>The only firm Labour switcher was Ronnie Campbell, who previously abstained. He told talkRADIO: \u201cSomewhere along the line, MPs have got to say, \u2018Enough\u2019s enough.\u2019 Let\u2019s go for the deal, let\u2019s do it.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The 28 Eurosceptic Tory hardliners have not said \u201cno\u201d to Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal, giving No 10 hope that they will swing behind the prime minister. The group, known as \u201cthe Spartans\u201d, had indicated they would take a lead from the Democratic Unionist party, which categorically said it would vote against Johnson\u2019s deal. But several of the Tory hardliners \u2013 from Peter Bone to Andrew Bridgen \u2013 suggested they were likely to vote for the agreement. It was not unanimous, however, as the European Research Group\u2019s steering committee, made up of senior MPs and former ministers, met on Thursday for a \u201cdeep discussion\u201d about the new agreement, which they went through line by line. \u201cThere were a lot of mixed views. This vote will cause some agony for some members, but it will be up to each member\u2019s conscience,\u201d said a source. Particular sticking points included the role of the European courts of justice in solving disputes \u2013 \u201cWhy can\u2019t it be the supreme court?\u201d said one member \u2013 and the failure to give the DUP a veto. \u201cWe have stood with the DUP for so long that for some members it will be painful to choose,\u201d said another. But even some of the most fervent Brexiters, including Steve Baker and Mark Francois, made positive noises about the settlement, saying there were \u201climited remaining concerns\u201d. Owen Paterson, the former Northern Ireland secretary and another hardliner, also did not rule out backing it. Another hard Brexiter, Sir Bernard Jenkin, said: \u201cIt looks very much better than [Theresa] May\u2019s deal, but I am going to read the details very carefully before deciding.\u201d The ERG will hold an emergency meeting on Saturday morning before going to the chamber for the vote. With many of them considering backing the deal, there were signs of discontent on the other wing of the Tory party, among former remainers and softer Brexiters. Oliver Letwin, a former Conservative who lost the whip, said he would be voting for the \u201cadmirable\u201d deal, but also signed a letter, along with David Gauke, the former justice secretary, demanding to see an impact assessment first. Some of the other former Conservatives who lost the whip were anxious not to be rushed into voting for a hard deal without proper scrutiny. There were also worries that voting for a deal could open the door to the Eurosceptics backing out at a later date, when the withdrawal agreement returns for a second reading, to cause a no-deal crash-out on 31 October. To mitigate the risk of this, there was talk on Thursday night of a cross-party amendment to force Johnson into a Brexit extension if the withdrawal agreement bill was voted down at a later stage in order to wreck it. At the same time, a number of pro-deal opposition MPs were agonising over whether to vote for the deal. Special advisers were tasked with contacting key Labour MPs on Thursday. Johnson himself is expected to begin calling round wavering ERG MPs and Labour MPs with large leave votes on Friday, Downing Street sources said. Labour MPs were coming under huge pressure from colleagues not to back a Johnson-led deal, but Ruth Smeeth, MP for Stoke-on-Trent North, said: \u201cI\u2019ve been quite clear publicly since April, I want to vote for a deal. It is my intention to vote for a deal unless [Johnson] has completely undermined workers\u2019 rights, environmental rights and consumer rights.\u201d But there was silence from many of the other pro-deal opposition MPs, including those who signed a letter telling the EU they wanted to vote for an agreement, such as Stephen Kinnock and Sarah Champion. One MP said: \u201cWhatever I say I will probably be met with a shower of abuse from one side or the other. I\u2019m still undecided whether to support the deal, which in many ways is less attractive than Theresa May\u2019s deal, but I have to think of the counterfactual, which is dangerous and risky.\u201d Jim Fitzpatrick, the Labour MP for Limehouse and Poplar, said he voted for May\u2019s deal and he would do the same with Johnson\u2019s agreement, but he said many of his colleagues had not decided. He said up to 20 Labour MPs could back a deal but said the fact it was Johnson made it harder to vote for than an agreement put forward by May. The only firm Labour switcher was Ronnie Campbell, who previously abstained. He told talkRADIO: \u201cSomewhere along the line, MPs have got to say, \u2018Enough\u2019s enough.\u2019 Let\u2019s go for the deal, let\u2019s do it.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson\u2019s team were pasty-faced with exhaustion as they briefed journalists about the details of the Brexit deal in Brussels on Thursday afternoon \u2013 but the PM himself was unable to suppress a beam of triumph, as he glad-handed his fellow leaders. Just a week after Johnson\u2019s meeting with the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, at a wedding venue on the Wirral, Downing Street hopes it has now engineered that rare thing in politics \u2013 a win-win situation. If the PM\u2019s deal is passed by MPs on Saturday, he\u2019s well on the way to getting Brexit done (the slogan \u201cGet Brexit Done\u201d was plastered on every available surface at the Tory conference in Manchester last month). If it\u2019s rejected, and he is forced by the Benn act into requesting an extension against his wishes, it will provide a clear, public demonstration of his claim that he wants to get on and take Britain out of the EU \u2013 and recalcitrant MPs have stopped him. This weekend\u2019s vote will be extremely tight, without the support of the DUP, which Number 10 had hoped they might secure, right up until Arlene Foster released her downbeat statement early on Thursday morning. One source said the DUP had been \u201crun over by a convoy of juggernauts\u201d and that the party had committed a tactical misstep when it agreed, two weeks ago, to yield on its opposition to regulatory alignment with the EU in exchange for a veto in Stormont. \u201cWhoever persuaded them to do this, and it has a whiff of Dominic Cummings, knew that once they had dropped one red line they couldn\u2019t object in principle to the customs red line. They must also have known that a veto in Northern Ireland would never have flown. They were duped,\u201d said the source. Meanwhile, Johnson and his aides were taking an increasingly emollient tone towards Dublin. Michel Barnier disclosed that Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar agreed in their summit in the Wirral that there would be no customs checks at the land border. This suggests that the prime minister had agreed to cross a DUP red line before he and Arlene Foster had their first of three sets of meetings in Downing Street. \u201cHe calculated that he needed a deal more than he needed the DUP,\u201d said one source. If he is to win without Foster\u2019s 10 MPs, Johnson will need many of the hardliners in the European Research Group (ERG) to forget their fealty to the DUP. He\u2019ll also have to win over a handful of Labour MPs, which explains why it is the cabinet\u2019s softer Brexiters \u2013 Matt Hancock and Robert Jenrick, for example \u2013 who have been sent out to defend the deal in the media. Johnson\u2019s political secretary, Danny Kruger, has already been reaching out to some Labour MPs; and Downing Street hinted at the possibility of more concessions on workers\u2019 rights and other issues close to the hearts of Labour MPs as the withdrawal agreement bill makes its way through parliament. But if the prime minister loses, he will aim to call a snap general election \u2013 a request Labour would be reluctant to block for a third time, once a Brexit delay has been secured \u2013 and campaign on the basis of getting his deal done. The Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, was already due to speak at a big rally in Westminster on Friday evening, and he will no doubt use it to cry betrayal and seek to outflank the Tories with the promise of a clean-break Brexit (essentially a no deal). Farage trounced Theresa May\u2019s Conservatives in May\u2019s European elections, and much of Johnson\u2019s strategy since arriving in Downing Street has focused on trying to reunite the leave vote. Number 10 believes the theatre around this week\u2019s deal \u2013 the fact Johnson succeeded in reopening the withdrawal agreement and securing concessions (albeit by making a few of his own) \u2013 will help to convince most Brexit voters that he\u2019s on their side. The whipless wonders \u2013 the rebel ex-Tories who were disciplined for backing the Benn act \u2013 have some concerns about the deal. But that there is now an agreement with the EU27 will assuage their worst fear: that the next Conservative manifesto would advocate a no-deal Brexit. If they return to the fold, they could go on to campaign on the basis of the Conservatives\u2019 domestic policy commitments, on schools, hospitals and crime. When Johnson tabled his \u201cfinal offer\u201d at the Tory party conference (not that he ever used that language himself), the reaction from many MPs was that he was deliberately setting himself up to fail because his ultimate aim was to secure a no-deal Brexit. Yet while his mercurial adviser Cummings may have been relaxed about the implications of no deal, Johnson became increasingly convinced it would be too risky, and prepared to make concessions. Most crucially, rather than waffling about \u201calternative arrangements\u201d, the government made clear it was ready to swallow customs checks in the Irish Sea: something May had suggested no prime minister could possibly sign up to. Clad in his trademark gilet and rumpled white shirt, Cummings was in Brussels on Thursday to watch the deal being done. He, like many of the other Vote Leave veterans in Number 10, sees his task in Downing Street as completing the job they began during that 2016 campaign. As those explosive briefings from \u201cDowning Street sources\u201d about Johnson\u2019s tetchy phone call with Angela Merkel made clear, they were ready to trash relations with Britain\u2019s EU partners if it got Britain out, \u201cdo or die\u201d by 31 October. But while Johnson does want to fulfil the promises of the Vote Leave campaign with which he will always be so personally associated, he also wants to secure himself a nice comfortable majority, and a five-year term behind the big black door.

Just 4% of those in England attending pupil referral units or similar alternative provision achieved grade 4s or higher in maths and English, while just 1.5% managed at least 5s in both subjects, the government\u2019s favoured \u201cstrong pass\u201d grade, with both figures being worse than the previous year\u2019s results. The national proportion of pupils in mainstream state schools achieving strong passes in compulsory GCSE maths and English fell slightly to below 44%. Despite a slight improvement in the number gaining 4s in the two subjects \u2013 equivalent to a grade C under the previous measure \u2013 more than one in three pupils were still unable to do so. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said it was a tragedy that more than 190,000 young people could fall short of achieving at least a grade 4 in English and maths after 12 years of schooling. \u201cEvery year this \u2018forgotten third\u2019 is a feature of our exam system, not by accident but because it is baked in by the mechanism used to distribute grades. We cannot continue to accept that one-third of pupils must \u2018fail\u2019 in order that two-thirds succeed,\u201d Barton, a former secondary school headteacher, said. \u201cThe government has raised the bar another notch by describing a grade 5 as a \u2018strong pass\u2019. Well over half of young people \u2013 57% this year \u2013 do not attain this benchmark in GCSE English and maths despite all the effort they have put into their studies. \u201cIt is a measure designed to raise standards but in fact risks leaving students feeling demoralised even though they have done really well.\u201d But while the overall results showed few positive signs, the school-level results calculated by the Department for Education (DfE) revealed some remarkable performances being made in improving pupils\u2019 results at both GCSE and A-level exams. Under the DfE\u2019s progress measure \u2013 which compares GCSE outcomes with the same pupils\u2019 results in tests at the end of primary school \u2013 three schools run by the Star Academies trust based in Blackburn showed the biggest improvements across England. The Tauheedul Islam girls\u2019 school in Blackburn run by Star Academies was the national leader for progress, with pupils achieving on average two grades higher in GCSE results than expected. But not far behind were two free schools established by Star Academies, the Eden boy\u2019s school in Birmingham and the Eden girls\u2019 school in Coventry. A little further down on the progress table was the Eden Girls\u2019 school in Waltham Forest and the Eden Girls\u2019 school in Slough. Hamid Patel, Star Academies\u2019 chief executive, said: \u201cFor five of our schools to be ranked among the top 15 in the country for progress, with a number of others following closely after them, demonstrates that non-selective schools can compete with the very best in the country and make a real difference for our pupils.\u201d Michaela school, a free school in Brent that recorded its first GCSE results this summer, came fifth for progress with pupils achieving grades one and half times higher than their previous results would suggest. \u201cI am extremely proud of our children for what they have achieved and of our staff for the quality of their teaching.

The national GCSE and A-level attainment tables were dominated by traditionally strong selective grammar and private schools, with three selective state girls schools topping the GCSE tables, and the independent St Paul\u2019s girls\u2019 school at the head of the table of A-levels by average points. But a selective state sixth form college, King\u2019s College London Maths school, came second by average A-level points, while its students\u2019 progress was also high. The DfE was keen to highlight the increasing proportion of pupils taking its favoured English baccalaureate suite of GCSE subjects, which nudged up to 40% this year.

Whenever he walked in the room, people stood up and clapped \u2013 the type of welcome usually reserved for guest preachers at church service.

The congressman was on an elevator, and immediately, I flashed my class ring and nervously blurted out all of these facts in what had to be less than five seconds. Soon after, I wondered whether he thought that I was some neurotic intern who just ruined one of his brief moments of peace. However, he smiled, laughed and responded, warmly in his gruff voice, \u201cYoung man, nice to meet you. I am proud of you. Baltimore needs young leaders like you to return home.\u201d My trepidation quickly dissipated. Congressman Cummings, the favored son of Baltimore and a stalwart of civil rights was proud of me \u2013 wow.</p> <p>I saw him as a personal hero and started to see my own story in his, though his legacy is unmatched. We both graduated from the esteemed Baltimore City College high school.

It\u2019s told very squarely on his shoulders, and I hope it\u2019s going to be a story that will be thrilling but also emotional.\u201d The cast will also include Jeffrey Wright as Commissioner Gordon, played by Gary Oldman in Christopher Nolan\u2019s Dark Knight trilogy. Last year saw Dano\u2019s directorial debut with drama Wildlife, starring Carey Mulligan and Jake Gyllenhaal. He\u2019s also attached to The Power of the Dog, the new film from Jane Campion that will also star Kirsten Dunst and Benedict Cumberbatch. Media sources suggest The Batman will begin production late this year or early 2020 with a summer 2021 release date confirmed. The casting news follows the record-breaking box office success of Joker, which has made $548m worldwide since its 4 October release. Next year also sees the release of the sequel Wonder Woman 1984, as well as Birds of Prey, starring Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. She previously played the character in Suicide Squad, which made $746m worldwide.",

The central bank\u2019s credit conditions survey asks lenders every quarter about the past three months and their expectations for the coming three months. Analysts said the figures revealed a growing caution across the finance industry as Brexit uncertainty weighed on their customers\u2019 appetite for credit and pushed some to the edge of bankruptcy. The balance of banks expecting to increase lending over the next three months fell from -5.8% in the third quarter to an expected -13.5% in the fourth quarter to reach its lowest level since 2009 when the balance dropped to almost -50%. In the first quarter the balance was -3.1%. Banks have seen the biggest collapse in demand from commercial property companies, coinciding with the downturn in retail spending, which has hit shops and retail developments. The Bank of England said banks kept credit lines open for smaller and large businesses in the third quarter but had seen an increasing reluctance among medium-sized businesses to extend loans. \u201cLenders reported a slight decrease in demand for corporate lending from small and large businesses, and a decrease in demand from medium businesses in the third quarter\u201d it said. Individuals are also expected to find it more difficult to get credit over the next three months as banks and building societies cut the length of interest-free periods on new credit card lending. The survey also found there was an increase in defaults on credit cards and other non-mortgage loans in the third quarter. Lenders expect default rates for non-mortgage lending to increase slightly in the fourth quarter. Michael Biemann, the head of property lender Selina Finance, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a concern that default rates on credit cards and loans rose in the third quarter, and equally worrying that lenders expect even more people to start having problems with their repayments in the upcoming quarter. \u201cWith money so cheap, there is a lot of debt out there and the worry is that for some people it is starting to prove too much, and at just the wrong time as we enter a potentially tough period for the economy.\u201d He said all sizes of business were suffering from Brexit uncertainty and reining in their borrowing. \u201cWhile there are many reasons why businesses start to struggle, the impact of Brexit uncertainty cannot be ignored and is likely to be the deciding factor in the current cycle.\u201d",

The US administration\u2019s sanctions \u2013 when they came on Monday \u2013 were largely hollow: the suspension of a $1bn (\u00a3700m) trade deal that never really existed and the doubling of tariffs on Turkish steel sales to the US, which amount to a fraction of a percent of the country\u2019s exports.

The military operation was well prepared. The last hurdle was the removal of US soldiers from the border, with which Trump obliged three days before sending the letter, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/07/us-to-let-turkish-forces-move-into-syria-abandoning-kurdish-allies\">a Sunday telephone call</a> with the Turkish president.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not because of the letter that Turkey went ahead with the operation,\u201d Sinan Ulgen, a veteran Turkish diplomat and now visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said. \u201cIt\u2019s just firstly because of the phone call and then the White House statement \u2013 which came before the letter \u2013 that Trump was pulling back the troops \u2026 So once Turkey got the signal from the White House, that Trump was moving back the troops, that basically gave the green light to the operation.\u201d</p> <p>The Turks were not alone in seeing the presidential missive as an empty threat in the wake of the telephone call. Bob Menendez, ranking Democrat on the Senate foreign relations committee, told NBC News: \u201cI consider the letter an effort to cover his backside after a firestorm of opposition. I didn\u2019t think it was a serious letter, at the end of the day.\u201d</p> <p>The Senate on Thursday introduced its own bipartisan sanctions package on Turkey, including restrictions on US arms sales, daring the president to use his veto. If Trump foregoes his veto, it will be a significant defeat. If he uses it, he risks it being overridden by an emboldened Congress, and further underlining the flimsiness of his threats to Erdo\u011fan.</p> <p>The letter may still end up at the US National Archives alongside the writings of Washington, Lincoln and Roosevelt. The comparison will not be flattering.</p> <p>Timothy Naftali, a presidential historian at New York University, said: \u201cSince the emergence of the modern presidency, presidents have had a legion of ghost writers and communication specialists and people whose job it was to present the American presidency as a sophisticated and smooth, and at times eloquent operation.</p> <p>\u201cDue to his inability to accept advice or counselling, Donald Trump has systematically eliminated many of the safeguards that his predecessors have put in place to ensure that however flawed the man, or some day the woman, at the centre of it all, the American presidency will continue to look professional. The Erdo\u011fan letter is the product of an amateur, that should never be an American state document.\u201d</p>",

The last hurdle was the removal of US soldiers from the border, with which Trump obliged three days before sending the letter, after a Sunday telephone call with the Turkish president. \u201cIt\u2019s not because of the letter that Turkey went ahead with the operation,\u201d Sinan Ulgen, a veteran Turkish diplomat and now visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said. \u201cIt\u2019s just firstly because of the phone call and then the White House statement \u2013 which came before the letter \u2013 that Trump was pulling back the troops \u2026 So once Turkey got the signal from the White House, that Trump was moving back the troops, that basically gave the green light to the operation.\u201d The Turks were not alone in seeing the presidential missive as an empty threat in the wake of the telephone call. Bob Menendez, ranking Democrat on the Senate foreign relations committee, told NBC News: \u201cI consider the letter an effort to cover his backside after a firestorm of opposition. I didn\u2019t think it was a serious letter, at the end of the day.\u201d The Senate on Thursday introduced its own bipartisan sanctions package on Turkey, including restrictions on US arms sales, daring the president to use his veto. If Trump foregoes his veto, it will be a significant defeat. If he uses it, he risks it being overridden by an emboldened Congress, and further underlining the flimsiness of his threats to Erdo\u011fan. The letter may still end up at the US National Archives alongside the writings of Washington, Lincoln and Roosevelt. The comparison will not be flattering. Timothy Naftali, a presidential historian at New York University, said: \u201cSince the emergence of the modern presidency, presidents have had a legion of ghost writers and communication specialists and people whose job it was to present the American presidency as a sophisticated and smooth, and at times eloquent operation. \u201cDue to his inability to accept advice or counselling, Donald Trump has systematically eliminated many of the safeguards that his predecessors have put in place to ensure that however flawed the man, or some day the woman, at the centre of it all, the American presidency will continue to look professional. The Erdo\u011fan letter is the product of an amateur, that should never be an American state document.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Democratic Unionist party is reeling from accusations it was duped and betrayed by Downing Street over a Brexit deal that weakens Northern Ireland\u2019s position in the UK. Rival unionists on Thursday said the DUP had committed a catastrophic miscalculation in trusting Boris Johnson, potentially putting Northern Ireland on a path towards a united Ireland. The DUP also risked isolation at Westminster where some Conservative Brexiters, who previously pledged solidarity with the DUP, signalled they would ignore the party\u2019s opposition and vote for the deal in a Commons vote on Saturday. It was a vertiginous fall to earth for a regional party that until recently boasted of unprecedented influence, its clout extending from Belfast to London and Brussels. Robin Swann, leader of the Ulster Unionist party (UUP), said DUP blunders had paved the way to Northern Ireland being left on the \u201cwindow ledge\u201d of the union. \u201cIt\u2019s an absolute disgrace ... this deal is worse than the one Theresa May brought forward at Chequers. It\u2019s awful. It would put a customs and regulatory border down the Irish Sea and annexes Northern Ireland from the rest of the United Kingdom.\u201d Jim Allister, leader of the Traditional Unionist Voice party, called the deal \u2013 welcomed by the Irish government and Sinn F\u00e9in \u2013 a disaster that would put Northern Ireland in the Republic of Ireland\u2019s economic orbit, ensuring the union \u201cslowly bleeds to death\u201d. \u201cThe inescapable reality is that a permanent regulatory and customs border cutting us off from GB puts us in a waiting room for Irish unity with the door locked from the outside.\u201d Many farmers and business owners, in contrast, welcomed a deal that would keep trade flowing and avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. \u201cWhat is good is that a deal is struck, we can move on to the more positive conversation about the future relationship and, regardless, Northern Ireland can continue to have tariff-free, quota-free access to both the UK and the EU\u2019s single market,\u201d said the Manufacturing Northern Ireland chief executive, Stephen Kelly. They are relieved they have certainty as the new arrangements will mean the same trading environment for four years beyond the transition period. Stormont then gets to vote, and if the new regime is popular and can command 60% support \u2013 with at least 40% each of the nationalist and unionist votes \u2013 it will be rolled over for another eight years, a protracted EU alignment that is anathema to the DUP. The party\u2019s deputy leader, Nigel Dodds, told the BBC that he felt the Benn act preventing no deal had pushed Boris Johnson \u201cinto desperate measures\u201d. Dodds said: \u201cHe has been too eager by far to get a deal at any cost, and the fact of the matter is, if he held his nerve and held out he would, of course, have got better concessions that kept the integrity, both economic and constitutionally, of the United Kingdom.\u201d Under Johnson\u2019s deal, Northern Ireland would legally remain in the UK\u2019s customs territory but stay in the EU\u2019s single market for goods. The EU\u2019s customs code would be enforced on goods coming from Great Britain into Northern Ireland. Under a complicated consent mechanism, four years after the end of the transition period, the Northern Ireland assembly at Stormont would vote on maintaining the arrangements. Crucially, the DUP would have no veto. The DUP rejected the deal and vowed to vote against it, saying it would undermine the integrity of the union and drive \u201ca coach and horses\u201d through the Good Friday agreement\u2019s consent mechanism. Once the details became clear DUP leaders pivoted towards a campaign to retain their base, said one source. \u201cShouting traitor from the green benches might suit them.\u201d Some Brexiters will blame the party if the deal falters in the Commons, further straining relations between Northern Ireland\u2019s unionists and English Conservatives. Rival unionists said DUP hubris led to the deal. A year ago the party\u2019s leader, Arlene Foster, boasted of its unprecedented influence at Westminster \u2013 where its 10 MPs propped up the government \u2013 and garlanded Johnson at its party conference. Johnson said Northern Ireland should be treated no differently from the rest of the UK. Two weeks ago Johnson, under pressure for a deal with Brussels, persuaded his allies to accept some regulatory alignment with the EU, necessitating checks in the Irish Sea. That concession \u2013 a DUP recognition that farmers and business owners feared a no-deal hit on Northern Ireland\u2019s economy \u2013 facilitated Downing Street stretching the measure to clinch a deal with Brussels, said Jon Tonge, a University of Liverpool politics professor and co-author of a book about the DUP. \u201cThey\u2019ve been completely stitched up by Boris Johnson. He reversed on all that he promised them. This deal gives the EU and Irish government huge economic leverage over Northern Ireland.\u201d Tonge called the consent mechanism a fantasy given Stormont\u2019s dysfunction \u2013 it has been mothballed since power sharing collapsed in January 2017. The anti-abortion DUP may receive another humiliation on Monday when abortion rights are due to be extended to Northern Ireland, the result of a vote by Labour and Conservative MPs at Westminster earlier this year. The Stormont assembly is due to sit on Monday for the first time since devolution collapsed after more than 30 members backed a recall petition to debate the law. Analysts said it was unlikely they could stop the law taking effect.",

      "body": "<p>When Alicia Alonso was 20, and launched on a dancing career in New York, her future seemed assured. She had just been recruited to the city\u2019s newly formed ballet company, Ballet Theatre, and already she was being cast in principal roles. But she had one anxiety: the flashing lights and dark spots that crisscrossed her vision. When she eventually went to be tested, she was diagnosed with severe retinal detachment.</p> <p>During the following two years, Alonso was forced to undergo three major eye operations with long periods of recovery during which she was unable to leave her bed. Yet she never stopped dancing. The role she had always aspired to perform was Giselle, and lying flat on her back she began to rehearse it \u2013 imagining the steps in her head and dancing them with her fingers on the sheet.</p> <p>The doctors told Alonso that she would never regain her peripheral vision and that her sight would progressively deteriorate. Despite all their warnings, Alonso not only returned to Ballet Theatre in 1943 but also made her debut as Giselle that year, stepping in at the last moment for the company\u2019s injured ballerina <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2004/dec/03/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\" title=\"Alicia Markova\">Alicia Markova</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9823663111bdb1545d38f482ee35e57264b5d621\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9823663111bdb1545d38f482ee35e57264b5d621/0_238_2213_2763/801.jpg\" alt=\"Alicia Alonso as the title character in Giselle, c1947.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alicia Alonso as the title character in Giselle, c1947.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Granger Historical Picture Archive/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She was greeted as a new star, the critic Edwin Denby hailing her as a \u201cmeticulous stylist\u201d, and Giselle became the role with which she was most identified. Over the next four and a half decades, Alonso continued to defy doctors\u2019 orders. She performed using specially placed lights to guide her onstage as her vision got worse, trusting to the whispered guidance of her partners, and to a precautionary wire stretched across the front of the stage.</p> <p>Alonso, who has died aged 98, had been stubborn and ambitious from a very early age. She was born Alicia Ernestina de la Caridad del Cobre Mart\u00ednez y del Hoyo in Havana to wealthy Spanish-Cuban parents. Her father was an officer in the army. In pre-revolutionary Cuba, life for a young woman of her class could be pampered, but from the age of nine Alonso was obsessed with ballet, training at the Sociedad Pro-Arte Musical in Havana. As a teenager, she danced Odette in an edited version of Swan Lake, using the stage name Alicia Mart\u00ednez.</p> <p>At this time she also fell in love with a fellow student, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/aug/09/fernando-alonso\" title=\"\">Fernando Alonso</a>, and in 1937 they married and left for New York and its promise of greater professional opportunities. Despite giving birth to a daughter, Laura, shortly afterwards, Alonso\u2019s progress was remarkable. She continued her training at the School of American Ballet and with noted teachers such as Anatole Vilzak, Ludmilla Schollar and Antony Tudor; by 1938 she was dancing on Broadway and by 1939 she was touring with George Balanchine and Lincoln Kirstein\u2019s Ballet Caravan (the company with which she danced her first major role as the Mother/Sweetheart in Eugene Loring\u2019s Billy the Kid).</p> <p>By 1940, when she joined Ballet Theatre, Alonso was developing an exceptional technique. She displayed an almost masculine strength and control in her balances and pirouettes but she possessed a distinctively feminine quality of expression \u2013 sensual, lyrical and vividly dramatic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ccde5f1a3ee1c64c1183f434128f502e92d6a6c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ccde5f1a3ee1c64c1183f434128f502e92d6a6c1/0_217_1466_1831/801.jpg\" alt=\"Alicia Alonso and her husband, Fernando, in the American Ballet Theatre production of Undertow, 1947.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alicia Alonso and her husband, Fernando, in the American Ballet Theatre production of Undertow, 1947.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gjon Mili/Time &amp; Life Pictures/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite the grim years of enforced immobility her career continued on its swift upward rise. Following her success in Giselle, in 1943, she was cast in an increasing number of leading roles. By 1946 she had been promoted to principal rank. That year Igor Youskevitch joined Ballet Theatre and became her regular stage partner. The chemistry between them was soon being compared to Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire in its emotional and physical rapport and was enshrined in Balanchine\u2019s Theme and Variations, created for them in 1947.</p> <p>The following year Ballet Theatre was suffering temporary financial problems , at which point Alonso opted to return to Havana to found her own company, Ballet Alicia Alonso. She brought several New York dancers with her and performed as the company\u2019s ballerina as well as choreographing and staging works including Giselle and a full-length Swan Lake.</p> <p>She was determined to nurture some kind of professional ballet culture in Cuba, and for several years commuted between New York and Havana, sustaining the company with Fernando as general director, his brother <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/alberto-alonso-national-ballet-of-cuba-co-founder-784369.html\" title=\"\">Alberto</a> as choreographer and artistic director and with financial assistance from wealthy Cuban families and the ministry of education.</p> <p>During the second half of the 1950s the repressive regime of <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Fulgencio-Batista\" title=\"\">Fulgencio Batista</a> made it difficult for her to keep her company going and Alonso was largely abroad. She toured with the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, performed with the Bolshoi and Kirov (she was the first western ballerina to be invited to the Soviet Union) and reunited with Ballet Theatre.</p> <p>By 1959 she was at the peak of her international celebrity as well as her professional artistry.

      "bodyText": "When Alicia Alonso was 20, and launched on a dancing career in New York, her future seemed assured. She had just been recruited to the city\u2019s newly formed ballet company, Ballet Theatre, and already she was being cast in principal roles. But she had one anxiety: the flashing lights and dark spots that crisscrossed her vision. When she eventually went to be tested, she was diagnosed with severe retinal detachment. During the following two years, Alonso was forced to undergo three major eye operations with long periods of recovery during which she was unable to leave her bed. Yet she never stopped dancing. The role she had always aspired to perform was Giselle, and lying flat on her back she began to rehearse it \u2013 imagining the steps in her head and dancing them with her fingers on the sheet. The doctors told Alonso that she would never regain her peripheral vision and that her sight would progressively deteriorate. Despite all their warnings, Alonso not only returned to Ballet Theatre in 1943 but also made her debut as Giselle that year, stepping in at the last moment for the company\u2019s injured ballerina Alicia Markova. She was greeted as a new star, the critic Edwin Denby hailing her as a \u201cmeticulous stylist\u201d, and Giselle became the role with which she was most identified. Over the next four and a half decades, Alonso continued to defy doctors\u2019 orders. She performed using specially placed lights to guide her onstage as her vision got worse, trusting to the whispered guidance of her partners, and to a precautionary wire stretched across the front of the stage. Alonso, who has died aged 98, had been stubborn and ambitious from a very early age. She was born Alicia Ernestina de la Caridad del Cobre Mart\u00ednez y del Hoyo in Havana to wealthy Spanish-Cuban parents. Her father was an officer in the army. In pre-revolutionary Cuba, life for a young woman of her class could be pampered, but from the age of nine Alonso was obsessed with ballet, training at the Sociedad Pro-Arte Musical in Havana. As a teenager, she danced Odette in an edited version of Swan Lake, using the stage name Alicia Mart\u00ednez. At this time she also fell in love with a fellow student, Fernando Alonso, and in 1937 they married and left for New York and its promise of greater professional opportunities. Despite giving birth to a daughter, Laura, shortly afterwards, Alonso\u2019s progress was remarkable. She continued her training at the School of American Ballet and with noted teachers such as Anatole Vilzak, Ludmilla Schollar and Antony Tudor; by 1938 she was dancing on Broadway and by 1939 she was touring with George Balanchine and Lincoln Kirstein\u2019s Ballet Caravan (the company with which she danced her first major role as the Mother/Sweetheart in Eugene Loring\u2019s Billy the Kid). By 1940, when she joined Ballet Theatre, Alonso was developing an exceptional technique. She displayed an almost masculine strength and control in her balances and pirouettes but she possessed a distinctively feminine quality of expression \u2013 sensual, lyrical and vividly dramatic. Despite the grim years of enforced immobility her career continued on its swift upward rise. Following her success in Giselle, in 1943, she was cast in an increasing number of leading roles. By 1946 she had been promoted to principal rank. That year Igor Youskevitch joined Ballet Theatre and became her regular stage partner. The chemistry between them was soon being compared to Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire in its emotional and physical rapport and was enshrined in Balanchine\u2019s Theme and Variations, created for them in 1947. The following year Ballet Theatre was suffering temporary financial problems , at which point Alonso opted to return to Havana to found her own company, Ballet Alicia Alonso. She brought several New York dancers with her and performed as the company\u2019s ballerina as well as choreographing and staging works including Giselle and a full-length Swan Lake. She was determined to nurture some kind of professional ballet culture in Cuba, and for several years commuted between New York and Havana, sustaining the company with Fernando as general director, his brother Alberto as choreographer and artistic director and with financial assistance from wealthy Cuban families and the ministry of education. During the second half of the 1950s the repressive regime of Fulgencio Batista made it difficult for her to keep her company going and Alonso was largely abroad. She toured with the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, performed with the Bolshoi and Kirov (she was the first western ballerina to be invited to the Soviet Union) and reunited with Ballet Theatre. By 1959 she was at the peak of her international celebrity as well as her professional artistry. Yet when Fidel Castro\u2019s revolutionary party came to power and Alonso was invited to return home to relaunch her company as the National Ballet of Cuba she responded almost immediately. With Castro\u2019s support and financial aid, the remarkable process was set in motion by which Alonso, with the help of Fernando, turned Cuba into a world centre for classical ballet. Integral to the success of the project was the excellence of the National Ballet School that they opened in 1962.

It is now surely clear that the deal comes as close as is feasible to a workable withdrawal from the EU, given the limitations set by the Commons since 2016. It also sets a framework for something quite separate, Britain\u2019s long-term relationship with the EU, which is yet to be negotiated in detail.</p> <p>Johnson won the Tory leadership by creating a problem for which there was by definition no solution. He would not just leave the EU but would replace its customs union with a \u201cfrictionless\u201d border in Ireland. There could be no such border, and Britain had no economic interest in having one. All the current chaos ensues from that. Despite his bluster, he has tried to avoid the greater lunacy of no deal. Faced with the impossibility of customs barriers, he has conceded a virtual border down the Irish Sea, regulatory alignment and a crazily bureaucratic scheme of tariff rebates. He is rumoured to have made concessions to die-hard unionists on abortion and subsidies. He has choked on a dozen promises, but he has eliminated the notorious backstop. In return, he has granted Belfast a veto on future trade deals.</p> <p>Johnson has deployed all his political charm to win over Ireland\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/10/breaking-the-mould-leo-varadkar-is-no-typical-irish-politician\" title=\"\">Leo Varadkar</a> and his own last-ditchers. The result is something of a coup. His deal is not permanent. It covers a withdrawal and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/02/boris-johnson-speech-gives-eu-hope-he-will-rethink-irish-plan\" title=\"\">\u201cstandstill\u201d transition,</a> but it must surely be last call for the UK\u2019s orderly departure from the EU, give or take some weeks of tidying up.

      "bodyText": "Here we go again. The bloody torso that is Brexit will this weekend dump itself in the torture chamber of the House of Commons. MPs will be asked to approve \u2013 in some fashion or other \u2013 the Brexit deal reached by Boris Johnson in Brussels. It is now surely clear that the deal comes as close as is feasible to a workable withdrawal from the EU, given the limitations set by the Commons since 2016. It also sets a framework for something quite separate, Britain\u2019s long-term relationship with the EU, which is yet to be negotiated in detail. Johnson won the Tory leadership by creating a problem for which there was by definition no solution. He would not just leave the EU but would replace its customs union with a \u201cfrictionless\u201d border in Ireland. There could be no such border, and Britain had no economic interest in having one. All the current chaos ensues from that. Despite his bluster, he has tried to avoid the greater lunacy of no deal. Faced with the impossibility of customs barriers, he has conceded a virtual border down the Irish Sea, regulatory alignment and a crazily bureaucratic scheme of tariff rebates. He is rumoured to have made concessions to die-hard unionists on abortion and subsidies. He has choked on a dozen promises, but he has eliminated the notorious backstop. In return, he has granted Belfast a veto on future trade deals. Johnson has deployed all his political charm to win over Ireland\u2019s Leo Varadkar and his own last-ditchers. The result is something of a coup. His deal is not permanent. It covers a withdrawal and a \u201cstandstill\u201d transition, but it must surely be last call for the UK\u2019s orderly departure from the EU, give or take some weeks of tidying up. A deal is done and on offer. And yet. At the last minute, the Democratic Unionist party has punched Johnson in the stomach. It is refusing to accept the deal, thus possibly denying him a Commons majority. This is despite opinion in the region strongly supporting continued trade links with the Republic. It means the DUP is on the brink of doing what Sinn F\u00e9in never achieved: turning majority opinion in the region in favour of reunification. The party is now demanding a specific unionists\u2019 veto in the Belfast assembly \u2013 not just an overall majority \u2013 on any new cross-border customs arrangement.

At least 1,711 people have been arrested since the protests started.</p> \n<p>Most commuters at Shadwell were not impressed. \u201cIs an electric train good or not?\u201d one asked the protesters. \u201cIs this train good for the environment?\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cThe way they\u2019re doing it is not right,\u201d said another, who complained that her daughter was now stuck on a DLR train between stations.</p> \n<p>XR said in a statement that activists were willing to go to prison \u201cin order to save lives in acts of conscience and necessity\u201d.</p> \n<p>The group said: \u201cThe actions are intended to bring further economic disruption to the capital as part of the ongoing campaign to convince the government to take meaningful action on the climate and ecological emergency.</p> \n<p>\u201cSafety measures are in place to ensure nobody is trapped underground.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"1b56a6e9-3ba9-4c70-b5d1-9782bf154f2b\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The UK group of Extinction Rebellion has three core demands:</p>\n    <p><b>1) Tell the truth</b><br>The government must tell the truth about the scale of the ecological crisis by declaring a climate emergency, \u201cworking with other groups and institutions to communicate the urgent need for change\u201d.</p>\n    <p><b>2) Net zero emissions by 2025</b><br>The UK must drastically cut its greenhouse gas emissions, hitting net zero by 2025.</p>\n    <p><b>3) Citizens\u2019 assembly</b><br>The government must create a citizens\u2019 assembly to hear evidence and devise policy to tackle the climate crisis. Citizens\u2019 assemblies bring together ordinary people to investigate, discuss and make recommendations on how to respond, in this case, to the ecological emergency.</p>\n    <p>In the US activists have added a further demand: \u201cA just transition that prioritises the most vulnerable and indigenous sovereignty [and] establishes reparations and remediation led by and for black people, indigenous people, people of colour and poor communities for years of environmental injustice.\u201d</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/matthewtaylor\"><b>Matthew Taylor</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The results of an internal poll of XR members, shared with the Guardian, showed 72% opposed action on London\u2019s underground network under any circumstances.</p> \n<p>It is understood the results of the survey were shared with the groups planning the transport action before it took place. No information on the size of the sample or the methodology of the poll was given.</p> \n<p>One activist who protested at Canning Town but was not arrested said she regretted that commuters had been affected. When XR activists previously took action on the DLR, in April, at Canary Wharf station, it was mainly financial workers who were immediately affected.</p> \n<p>XR had said that Thursday was to be a day to \u201cpause and focus on training, outreach and our plans for attrition actions nationwide in the coming months\u201d.</p> \n<p>But instead it proved to be a day in which a number of affiliated groups acted autonomously in staging their own actions around London. In Southwark, two members of the Animal Rebellion faction were arrested outside the offices of the farm standards organisation Red Tractor Assurance.</p> \n<p>Connor Thomas, 23, from Newcastle, said Red Tractor was in hock to the farming industry. \u201cThese are farmers regulating farms, they are going to go for whatever the cheapest, most profitable option is \u2013 with no care for the animal welfare,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Protesters from 13 different groups gathered outside the Bangladesh high commission in a protest over a planned coal-fired power plant they said would despoil and destroy the world\u2019s biggest mangrove forest, the Sundarbans.</p> \n<p>Dr Akhter Khan, of the Phulbari Solidarity Group UK, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a unique ecosystem, home of the Bengal tiger. The Bangladeshi and Indian governments want to set up a coal-based power plant \u2026 that will emit huge amounts of carbon and other pollutants that will cause the destruction of the forest.</p> \n<p>Also on Thursday morning, protesters from XR Peace staged actions targeting the London offices of the arms makers Leonardo, Lockheed Martin and BAE Systems. At 11am nine activists from the group glued themselves together outside the supreme court in Westminster.</p> \n<p>Sylvia Boyes, 75, a Quaker from Keighly, said: \u201cWe are calling on the supreme court to end all arms sales, especially those to regimes such as Saudi Arabia, where the weapons are being used in clear violation of international humanitarian law in the war on Yemen.\u201d</p> \n<p>Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, said: \u201cI strongly condemn the Extinction Rebellion protesters who have targeted the London Underground and DLR this morning. This illegal action is extremely dangerous, counterproductive and is causing unacceptable disruption to Londoners who use public transport to get to work.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is also an unfair burden on our already overstretched police officers. I urge demonstrators to protest peacefully and within the boundaries of the law.\u201d</p> \n<p>A rail union meanwhile urged Extinction Rebellion protesters to think again over attempts to disrupt public transport, describing the actions as dangerous and counterproductive.</p> \n<p>Manuel Cortes, the general secretary of the TSSA, said: \u201cEarlier this week I signed a letter condemning the Metropolitan police for banning peaceful climate protest.</p> \n<p>\u201cI have not changed my mind on this, but protesters should be mindful that what they have done today has simply inconvenienced ordinary working people trying to get on with their lives and trying to work on the most carbon-emission friendly options available to them to date.\u201d</p> \n<p>The ban on XR protests in London is due to remain in place until they finish on Saturday, after judges in the high court put off a hearing on a legal challenge by the group until next week.</p> \n<p>Lawyers for XR on Wednesday filed an application for a judicial review of the Metropolitan police\u2019s section 14.</p> \n<p>Tobias Garnett, a human rights lawyer working with XR\u2019s legal strategy team, said: \u201cWhile we are disappointed that the court is not able to hear the application sooner \u2013 particularly given the immediate risk of people being unlawfully arrested for peaceful, non-violent protest \u2013 we nonetheless look forward to putting forward our arguments next week.\u201d </p>",

He acknowledges his accountability for this action and we offer gratitude for members of the public who helped to protect him,\u201d the group said. \u201cIn light of today\u2019s events, Extinction Rebellion will be looking at ways to bring people together rather than create an unnecessary division.\u201d It later issued an apology in a statement on its Facebook account. It said: \u201cFollowing our previous statement on this morning\u2019s London transport actions, we would also like to apologise to all those whose lives we disrupted this morning. We have spent a lot of time thinking about how best to respond. \u201cExtinction Rebellion remains fully committed to nonviolence. The climate and ecological emergency is the biggest threat facing us all today, and it is unfortunate that something like this has to happen for this to become \u2018newsworthy\u2019. \u201cThat said, we are all incredibly sad at how events unfolded this morning, and are using this as an opportunity to learn and reflect as an organisation. Although we are pushing for disruption and civil disobedience, we are still learning how to do this in a way that does not result in violence, and that does not discriminate against hard-working individuals, especially those in communities who stand to be most affected by the climate and ecological crisis and are most vulnerable to systems of power.\u201d The group launched a wave of civil disobedience on 7 October to highlight the risks posed by the climate crisis and the accelerating loss of plant and animal species. At least 1,711 people have been arrested since the protests started. Most commuters at Shadwell were not impressed. \u201cIs an electric train good or not?\u201d one asked the protesters. \u201cIs this train good for the environment?\u201d \u201cThe way they\u2019re doing it is not right,\u201d said another, who complained that her daughter was now stuck on a DLR train between stations. XR said in a statement that activists were willing to go to prison \u201cin order to save lives in acts of conscience and necessity\u201d. The group said: \u201cThe actions are intended to bring further economic disruption to the capital as part of the ongoing campaign to convince the government to take meaningful action on the climate and ecological emergency. \u201cSafety measures are in place to ensure nobody is trapped underground.\u201d The results of an internal poll of XR members, shared with the Guardian, showed 72% opposed action on London\u2019s underground network under any circumstances. It is understood the results of the survey were shared with the groups planning the transport action before it took place. No information on the size of the sample or the methodology of the poll was given. One activist who protested at Canning Town but was not arrested said she regretted that commuters had been affected. When XR activists previously took action on the DLR, in April, at Canary Wharf station, it was mainly financial workers who were immediately affected. XR had said that Thursday was to be a day to \u201cpause and focus on training, outreach and our plans for attrition actions nationwide in the coming months\u201d. But instead it proved to be a day in which a number of affiliated groups acted autonomously in staging their own actions around London. In Southwark, two members of the Animal Rebellion faction were arrested outside the offices of the farm standards organisation Red Tractor Assurance. Connor Thomas, 23, from Newcastle, said Red Tractor was in hock to the farming industry. \u201cThese are farmers regulating farms, they are going to go for whatever the cheapest, most profitable option is \u2013 with no care for the animal welfare,\u201d he said. Protesters from 13 different groups gathered outside the Bangladesh high commission in a protest over a planned coal-fired power plant they said would despoil and destroy the world\u2019s biggest mangrove forest, the Sundarbans. Dr Akhter Khan, of the Phulbari Solidarity Group UK, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a unique ecosystem, home of the Bengal tiger. The Bangladeshi and Indian governments want to set up a coal-based power plant \u2026 that will emit huge amounts of carbon and other pollutants that will cause the destruction of the forest. Also on Thursday morning, protesters from XR Peace staged actions targeting the London offices of the arms makers Leonardo, Lockheed Martin and BAE Systems. At 11am nine activists from the group glued themselves together outside the supreme court in Westminster. Sylvia Boyes, 75, a Quaker from Keighly, said: \u201cWe are calling on the supreme court to end all arms sales, especially those to regimes such as Saudi Arabia, where the weapons are being used in clear violation of international humanitarian law in the war on Yemen.\u201d Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, said: \u201cI strongly condemn the Extinction Rebellion protesters who have targeted the London Underground and DLR this morning. This illegal action is extremely dangerous, counterproductive and is causing unacceptable disruption to Londoners who use public transport to get to work. \u201cIt is also an unfair burden on our already overstretched police officers. I urge demonstrators to protest peacefully and within the boundaries of the law.\u201d A rail union meanwhile urged Extinction Rebellion protesters to think again over attempts to disrupt public transport, describing the actions as dangerous and counterproductive. Manuel Cortes, the general secretary of the TSSA, said: \u201cEarlier this week I signed a letter condemning the Metropolitan police for banning peaceful climate protest. \u201cI have not changed my mind on this, but protesters should be mindful that what they have done today has simply inconvenienced ordinary working people trying to get on with their lives and trying to work on the most carbon-emission friendly options available to them to date.\u201d The ban on XR protests in London is due to remain in place until they finish on Saturday, after judges in the high court put off a hearing on a legal challenge by the group until next week. Lawyers for XR on Wednesday filed an application for a judicial review of the Metropolitan police\u2019s section 14. Tobias Garnett, a human rights lawyer working with XR\u2019s legal strategy team, said: \u201cWhile we are disappointed that the court is not able to hear the application sooner \u2013 particularly given the immediate risk of people being unlawfully arrested for peaceful, non-violent protest \u2013 we nonetheless look forward to putting forward our arguments next week.\u201d",

Significant numbers of the Kurds in the SDF were also members of the People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG), an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK) that has fought an insurgency against the Turkish state for more than 35 years in which as many as 40,000 people have died.

The PKK is listed as a terrorist group by Turkey, the US, the UK, Nato and others and this has proved awkward for the US and its allies, who have chosen to downplay the SDF\u2019s links to the PKK, preferring to focus on their shared objective of defeating Isis.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are Turkey\u2019s objectives on its southern border?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Turkey aims firstly to push the SDF away from its border, creating a 20-mile (32km) buffer zone that would have been jointly patrolled by Turkish and US troops until Trump\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/07/us-withdrawal-from-syria-leaves-fate-of-isis-fighters-and-families-in-detention-uncertain\">recent announcement</a>&nbsp;that American soldiers would withdraw from the region.</p>\n    <p>Erdo\u011fan has also said he would seek to relocate more than 1 million Syrian refugees in this \u201csafe zone\u201d, both removing them from his country (where their presence has started to create a backlash) and complicating the demographic mix in what he fears could become an autonomous Kurdish state on his border.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How would a Turkish incursion impact on Isis?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Nearly 11,000 Isis fighters, including almost 2,000 foreigners, and tens of thousands of their wives and children, are being held in detention camps and hastily fortified prisons across north-eastern Syria.</p>\n    <p>SDF leaders have warned they cannot guarantee the security of these prisoners if they are forced to redeploy their forces to the frontlines of a war against Turkey.

      "bodyText": "Shifting frontlines and allegiances in Syria are making it difficult to respond to the growing humanitarian crisis triggered by Turkey\u2019s offensive on Kurdish-controlled parts of the country, aid groups have said. After eight days of the Turkish operation about 300,000 people have been displaced from their homes and at least 71 people killed in north-east Syria, according to the UN and a human rights monitor. Local officials on Thursday put the number of dead at 231. Over the border in Turkey, 20 civilians have been killed in counterattacks. The Syrian towns of Ras al-Ayn and Tel Abyad, the two main targets of Turkish troops and their Syrian rebel allies, have emptied of people after a week of shelling, rocket attacks and ground clashes as the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) fight back. Roj hospital, Ras al-Ayn\u2019s only medical facility, has reportedly been hit by heavy machine gun fire, two sources said. A medical worker at the facility died of his wounds on Thursday after being injured in shelling several days ago. The International Rescue Committee (IRC) said an apparent airstrike hit a \u201ctrauma stabilisation point\u201d run by a local organisation and that two of the group\u2019s ambulances were damaged despite being clearly marked. It said its ambulances were being fired on every time they approached Ras al-Ayn, preventing them from reaching the town. Unable to guarantee its employees\u2019 safety, IRC and many other aid agencies have suspended operations and removed staff from the area. Some are still operating away from the frontline, but as Syrian government forces move in under the terms of a deal between the SDF and the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, many of the biggest international aid providers will have to withdraw because they are not registered in Damascus. \u201cThere will be a huge impact on where we\u2019re able to access in the north-east,\u201d said Sonia Khush, the Syria response director at Save the Children. \u201cWe have to leave as the battle lines change.\u201d Turkey launched Operation Peace Spring last Wednesday after Donald Trump announced the withdrawal of US troops from the area, effectively removing the buffer stopping the two forces from clashing. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, has long maintained the SDF is indistinguishable from Turkey\u2019s militant Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK). The offensive has been met with international condemnation for opening a new front in Syria\u2019s complex war and risking the return of Islamic State, which the SDF, with help from its US patrons, finally defeated in March. The US president has been heavily criticised for what allies and foes alike have deemed his betrayal of a loyal military partner. An array of armies are scrambling for control of key towns and roads after the SDF reached a deal with the Syrian regime, their former opponents, for military backup to defend against Turkey. US troops have pulled out, Russian forces allied to Assad have moved in, and in the chaos at least seven men and 750 women and children with links to Isis have escaped from detention centres and prisons in three separate breakouts. Civilians have mostly fled south, away from the scope of Turkey\u2019s proposed 20-mile (32km) deep \u201csafe zone\u201d on its border. Many have ended up crowding the floors of relatives\u2019 houses and approximately 40 schools are now emergency shelters. Others have gone east to Semalka, the area\u2019s only international border crossing, which joins north-east Syria to Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq. Officials said almost 1,000 Syrian Kurds had entered the area since the launch of the Turkish operation, but many are camped out without papers or permission to cross. Iraqi Kurdistan, where thousands of people are still in displacement camps after fleeing Isis\u2019s advance in 2014, is reticent about taking more refugees. \u201cWhere can we go except here?\u201d Omar Boobe Hose, a refugee from Ras al-Ayn, said to Agence France-Presse. \u201cWe can\u2019t go to Turkey, because they are our enemy, and the other side is also our enemy, the Syrian [government] side.

One of the organisers of the letter, Sara Khan, said the group felt the need to raise awareness of Gandhi\u2019s comments as soon as they heard about proposals for the statue two weeks ago, \u201cgiven that it is October \u2013 Black History Month\u201d.

In response to the charity\u2019s assertion that it was \u201cnon-political\u201d and not aligned with any national government, Khan said the idea that Gandhi was a \u201cspiritual figure\u201d who transcends politics \u201cis something we should reject\u201d.

Kristalina Georgieva, the IMF\u2019s new managing director, said there would still be some impact from leaving the EU with an agreement but said much of that had already been felt in the period since the 2016 referendum. Speaking at a press conference at the IMF\u2019s annual meeting in Washington, Georgieva urged MPs to back the deal in Saturday\u2019s vote. \u201cAs my old boss Jean-Claude Juncker has said: \u2018Where there\u2019s a will there\u2019s a deal.\u2019 I hope that will holds in all quarters.\u201d Georgieva was joined in welcoming the news by the president of the World Bank, David Malpass, who said an agreement would remove one of the factors holding back growth in poor countries. The IMF and the World Bank have identified a no-deal Brexit as one of the key factors that could turn the current slowdown in the global economy into a full-blown recession. Georgieva identified Brexit \u2013 along with the trade war between China and the US, and geopolitical tensions \u2013 as one of the three fractures that were holding back growth. \u201cThis is good news.

Monetary policy \u2013 interest rates and quantitative easing \u2013 should be used wisely and with an acknowledgement of the risks to financial stability from low borrowing costs. She added that fiscal policy \u2013 tax and public spending \u2013 should play a more central role for countries with strong budgetary positions and that structural reforms \u2013 such as cutting red tape and encouraging greater female participation in the workforce \u2013 should be undertaken. \u201cFinally, we need to promote stronger international cooperation because so many of the challenges we face \u2013 from financial regulation to money laundering and climate change - do not respect national borders.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "British companies have expressed concerns that Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal could leave industry worse off than under the previous agreement with the EU. Businesses, investors and economists have been almost unanimously in favour of the UK securing a withdrawal deal with the EU to avoid a no-deal Brexit, and markets appeared to welcome a diminished risk of a chaotic break on 31 October, after the UK and the EU unveiled a revised deal on Thursday. Sterling initially surged on news of the agreement to a five-month high of $1.2988 against the US dollar. However, in volatile trade, the currency later gave up all its gains, falling as low as $1.2756 after the Democratic Unionist party said it would not back the deal. The FTSE 100 rose by 0.52% to 7,182 points. The vast majority of the 141 clauses contained in the revised political declaration published by the UK and the EU are identical to what was agreed by Theresa May. But the line in the declaration that \u201cthe United Kingdom will consider aligning with union rules in relevant areas\u201d in any future trade talks has been ditched, as well as a clause promising a relationship \u201cas close as possible\u201d to the current arrangements. An industry source said the changes meant the new agreement was \u201ceither the same or worse than the March deal\u201d for goods exporters on every issue. Multiple sources in industry groups and major companies said the new deal gave greater scope for regulatory divergence that would make it more difficult for British companies to sell to their biggest export market. The revised declaration also abandoned a commitment to avoid rules of origin checks, potentially adding significant barriers to trade, which could affect industries reliant on frictionless imports, such as the automotive sector. A spokeswoman for Jaguar Land Rover, the UK\u2019s largest carmaker, said the company \u201cneeds a deal that protects tariff-free and frictionless trade and guarantees a level playing field on critical areas of regulation and immigration\u201d. Carolyn Fairbairn, the director general of the Confederation of British Industry, said \u201cbusiness has serious concerns about the direction of the future UK-EU relationship\u201d and the deal remained \u201cinadequate\u201d on services. \u201cDecades of free and frictionless trade with the UK\u2019s largest market, forged by thousands of firms big and small, must not be abandoned,\u201d she said. May gave business groups explicit verbal assurances that her government would seek to continue regulatory cooperation with the EU after Brexit. The present government has so far not given any similar assurances and the indications have been that it would seek a deregulatory agenda, according to a separate source involved in discussions between business and ministers. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy was approached for comment.",

The prospect of Scotland leaving the UK, possibly followed by Wales and a united Ireland not far behind, conjures up a nightmare vision of a rightwing, isolationist England which is deeply unappealing to many who were once proud to be English as well as British and, dare I say, European. But identity works on many levels and, as Aditya points out, nations come and go and are created by people, and similarly destroyed by them.</p> <p>Within England, regionalism of the sort that is common across Europe \u2013 progressive, inclusive and broadly centre-left \u2013 has really been \u201cthe dog that never barked\u201d. Maybe it\u2019s time for it to do so. The north, whatever the reasons behind it voting leave, is increasingly distanced from London and the south-east. We have far more in common with Scotland and Wales. Maybe in decades to come a progressive northern nation will take its place alongside Scotland, Wales and Ireland. For now, the need for a strong and democratic voice for the north of England has never been more urgent.<br><strong>Professor Paul Salveson</strong><br><em>Bolton, Greater Manchester</em></p> <p>\u2022 Both Aditya Chakraborrty and Martin Kettle (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/16/at-first-accepted-brexit-now-clear-must-not-leave-eu\" title=\"\">First, I accepted Brexit. Now it\u2019s clear we must not leave the EU</a>, 17 October) address the risk of the UK falling apart under strain from the Brexit process. An independent Scotland is now inevitable. What is the problem with this \u2013 and an independent Wales or a united Ireland for that matter? Scotland is just as viable an economic entity as Denmark (similar population); a united Ireland would end the \u201cborder problem\u201d and Wales is a larger entity than Luxembourg. The enabler for this sensible and coherent geographical/social outcome is membership of the EU which could be reformed to reflect the democratic importance of smaller nation states and regions.</p> <p>This would necessitate much more democratic representation in Brussels, with a Europe-wide elected president. Minority rights would be guaranteed in a new European constitution so that Protestants in Northern Ireland would have security. Eventually secularisation, which has civilised Ireland and Britain, would see barriers to cooperation between Protestants and Catholics consigned to history. The outcome for England within a strengthened EU would be hugely beneficial. England could finally get rid of our nostalgic pretensions rooted in imperial dominance, throw off the succubus of rightwing nationalism, and take our place in the world alongside our European partners.<br><strong>Philip Wood</strong><br><em>Kidlington, Oxfordshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Coverage of Scottish politics in London-based papers can often seem out of sync to activists. Zoe Williams\u2019 take on the prospects of Scottish independence (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/15/nicola-sturgeon-independence-labour-scottish-referendum-snp\" title=\"\">The weakness at the heart of Sturgeon\u2019s plan</a>, 15 October) was a perfect example.</p> <p>Firstly, Scottish independence is not solely the project of the SNP. Scottish Greens and countless others support the notion, and for a whole host of reasons.</p> <p>Secondly, and more importantly, with first-past-the-post and more than 800 unelected lords, Westminster still fails to be a democracy in any meaningful sense. Despite promises, Labour has never had any serious plan to reform the Lords or the voting system. Until the main UK parties commit to real reform, there will continue to be a case for Scottish independence.</p> <p>Third is the issue of nuclear weapons. An independent Scotland would sign up to the UN treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons, signed by 79 countries, but notably not by the UK. Threatening every citizen of a nation to keep their rogue leaders in check is no way for a civilisation to behave. The world\u2019s nuclear arsenal could eliminate life on Earth in a matter of hours, faster than even the climate emergency.</p> <p>Finally, it is frustrating when commentators based in England say the 2014 referendum seemed bitter, because that isn\u2019t how it felt here in Scotland. My own husband and some of my closest friends voted no \u2013 but have since changed their minds.</p> <p>During that campaign everyone was talking about proportional representation, devolved powers and what kind of country they wanted Scotland to be. It was energising and hopeful. I hope we can do it again soon and then start building a greener, fairer, more democratic, nuclear-free Scotland, regardless of who is in control at Westminster.<br><strong>Lorna Slater </strong><br><em>Co-leader of the Scottish Greens </em></p> <p>\u2022 \u201cSaving the union will need imagination \u2013 and we\u2019ve lost it.\u201d Chakrabortty\u2019s article is outstanding, sharply observed and should be required reading.

The prospect of Scotland leaving the UK, possibly followed by Wales and a united Ireland not far behind, conjures up a nightmare vision of a rightwing, isolationist England which is deeply unappealing to many who were once proud to be English as well as British and, dare I say, European. But identity works on many levels and, as Aditya points out, nations come and go and are created by people, and similarly destroyed by them. Within England, regionalism of the sort that is common across Europe \u2013 progressive, inclusive and broadly centre-left \u2013 has really been \u201cthe dog that never barked\u201d. Maybe it\u2019s time for it to do so. The north, whatever the reasons behind it voting leave, is increasingly distanced from London and the south-east. We have far more in common with Scotland and Wales. Maybe in decades to come a progressive northern nation will take its place alongside Scotland, Wales and Ireland. For now, the need for a strong and democratic voice for the north of England has never been more urgent. Professor Paul Salveson Bolton, Greater Manchester \u2022 Both Aditya Chakraborrty and Martin Kettle (First, I accepted Brexit. Now it\u2019s clear we must not leave the EU, 17 October) address the risk of the UK falling apart under strain from the Brexit process. An independent Scotland is now inevitable. What is the problem with this \u2013 and an independent Wales or a united Ireland for that matter? Scotland is just as viable an economic entity as Denmark (similar population); a united Ireland would end the \u201cborder problem\u201d and Wales is a larger entity than Luxembourg. The enabler for this sensible and coherent geographical/social outcome is membership of the EU which could be reformed to reflect the democratic importance of smaller nation states and regions. This would necessitate much more democratic representation in Brussels, with a Europe-wide elected president. Minority rights would be guaranteed in a new European constitution so that Protestants in Northern Ireland would have security. Eventually secularisation, which has civilised Ireland and Britain, would see barriers to cooperation between Protestants and Catholics consigned to history. The outcome for England within a strengthened EU would be hugely beneficial. England could finally get rid of our nostalgic pretensions rooted in imperial dominance, throw off the succubus of rightwing nationalism, and take our place in the world alongside our European partners. Philip Wood Kidlington, Oxfordshire \u2022 Coverage of Scottish politics in London-based papers can often seem out of sync to activists. Zoe Williams\u2019 take on the prospects of Scottish independence (The weakness at the heart of Sturgeon\u2019s plan, 15 October) was a perfect example. Firstly, Scottish independence is not solely the project of the SNP. Scottish Greens and countless others support the notion, and for a whole host of reasons. Secondly, and more importantly, with first-past-the-post and more than 800 unelected lords, Westminster still fails to be a democracy in any meaningful sense. Despite promises, Labour has never had any serious plan to reform the Lords or the voting system. Until the main UK parties commit to real reform, there will continue to be a case for Scottish independence. Third is the issue of nuclear weapons. An independent Scotland would sign up to the UN treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons, signed by 79 countries, but notably not by the UK. Threatening every citizen of a nation to keep their rogue leaders in check is no way for a civilisation to behave. The world\u2019s nuclear arsenal could eliminate life on Earth in a matter of hours, faster than even the climate emergency. Finally, it is frustrating when commentators based in England say the 2014 referendum seemed bitter, because that isn\u2019t how it felt here in Scotland. My own husband and some of my closest friends voted no \u2013 but have since changed their minds. During that campaign everyone was talking about proportional representation, devolved powers and what kind of country they wanted Scotland to be. It was energising and hopeful. I hope we can do it again soon and then start building a greener, fairer, more democratic, nuclear-free Scotland, regardless of who is in control at Westminster. Lorna Slater Co-leader of the Scottish Greens \u2022 \u201cSaving the union will need imagination \u2013 and we\u2019ve lost it.\u201d Chakrabortty\u2019s article is outstanding, sharply observed and should be required reading. All of us attending the People\u2019s Vote march this Saturday, myself included, should remember why it is essential to continue the argument. This should not be a time to concede defeat.

At least 10 farmers are now before the courts, with many from areas within Humphries\u2019 old seat.</p> <p>The old Native Vegetation Act, which was deeply resented by farmers, particularly in Barwon, was repealed in August 2017. It was replaced by the Local Land Services Act, which made land clearing easier and allowed farmers to self-assess whether they required approval.</p> <p>But even before the new laws came into place, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2019/oct/17/stripped-bare-australias-hidden-climate-crisis\">rates of land clearing \u2013 particularly in north-west NSW \u2013 had increased sharply</a> as farmers anticipated a change in the law. The latest available figures show clearing has tripled from about 9,000 hectares a year in 2014-15 to more than 27,000 hectares in 2017-18. That\u2019s equivalent to 100 Sydney central business districts each year.</p> <p>Much of these newly cleared areas are now vast plains of dirt because farmers have not been able to plant them during the drought.</p> <p>The land clearing has also divided communities, pitting farmers and large agribusiness against the officers charged with enforcing the environmental laws and environmentalists.</p> <p>While Kevin Humphries was local member \u2013 he retired at the March state election \u2013 he appears to have single-handedly raised farmers\u2019 expectations about what they would be permitted to do under the new laws.</p> <p>More than 150 farmers are facing compliance actions over land clearing in NSW \u2013 with the majority from the north-west of the state.</p> <p>During his hearing before the land and environment court this year, Jeffrey Brummell, a farmer from Rowena, near Walgett, told the court that he accepted he should have looked into the legality of clearing the 423 hectares of vegetation from his property, but that he had relied on advice from Humphries.</p> <p>In accepting his guilty plea in August, Chief Justice Brian Preston made special mention of Brummell\u2019s evidence, saying he \u201chad acted on incorrect representations by the local state MP regarding the relaxation of Native vegetation laws\u201d.</p> <p>According to Brummell, he had attended a meeting of farmers where he alleges Humphries had said words to the effect of: \u201cWe\u2019re going to get rid of the native vegetation laws and we\u2019re going to fix that area so farmers can again undertake farming and develop country.\u201d</p> <p>Brummell accepted that he should have sought legal advice or advice from the Local Land Services.</p> <p>Another judgment in April also raises questions about the role of the former local member. Anthony Boyle, a farmer from Garah, also in Walgett shire, pleaded guilty to clearing 500 hectares that included koala habitat.

      "bodyText": "A former minister in the Berejiklian government is alleged to have told farmers in his north-west rural New South Wales seat that they could clear native vegetation with impunity because the government was planning to change the law and they would not be prosecuted. At least that is the message farmers say they took away from numerous meetings and conversations with the former member for Barwon, Kevin Humphries. At least two farmers who were later prosecuted for illegal land clearing have raised conversations with Humphries during sentencing hearings in the NSW land and environment court in the last four months \u2013 and the judges hearing the cases have included the accounts in their judgments. Guardian Australia understands that other farmers who are being investigated have raised similar conversations with their legal representatives as they prepared their cases. At least 10 farmers are now before the courts, with many from areas within Humphries\u2019 old seat. The old Native Vegetation Act, which was deeply resented by farmers, particularly in Barwon, was repealed in August 2017. It was replaced by the Local Land Services Act, which made land clearing easier and allowed farmers to self-assess whether they required approval. But even before the new laws came into place, rates of land clearing \u2013 particularly in north-west NSW \u2013 had increased sharply as farmers anticipated a change in the law. The latest available figures show clearing has tripled from about 9,000 hectares a year in 2014-15 to more than 27,000 hectares in 2017-18. That\u2019s equivalent to 100 Sydney central business districts each year. Much of these newly cleared areas are now vast plains of dirt because farmers have not been able to plant them during the drought. The land clearing has also divided communities, pitting farmers and large agribusiness against the officers charged with enforcing the environmental laws and environmentalists. While Kevin Humphries was local member \u2013 he retired at the March state election \u2013 he appears to have single-handedly raised farmers\u2019 expectations about what they would be permitted to do under the new laws. More than 150 farmers are facing compliance actions over land clearing in NSW \u2013 with the majority from the north-west of the state. During his hearing before the land and environment court this year, Jeffrey Brummell, a farmer from Rowena, near Walgett, told the court that he accepted he should have looked into the legality of clearing the 423 hectares of vegetation from his property, but that he had relied on advice from Humphries. In accepting his guilty plea in August, Chief Justice Brian Preston made special mention of Brummell\u2019s evidence, saying he \u201chad acted on incorrect representations by the local state MP regarding the relaxation of Native vegetation laws\u201d. According to Brummell, he had attended a meeting of farmers where he alleges Humphries had said words to the effect of: \u201cWe\u2019re going to get rid of the native vegetation laws and we\u2019re going to fix that area so farmers can again undertake farming and develop country.\u201d Brummell accepted that he should have sought legal advice or advice from the Local Land Services. Another judgment in April also raises questions about the role of the former local member. Anthony Boyle, a farmer from Garah, also in Walgett shire, pleaded guilty to clearing 500 hectares that included koala habitat. He was fined $348,750. Boyle said he had bought a nearby property, Brynaman, because there was publicity about the repeal of the Native Vegetation Act and he could see scope to do what he had done at his main property, converting it from grazing to cropping by clearing land. He said that in 2014 Humphries and other senior National party officials had assured farmers that clearing native vegetation would again be lawful. While Boyle admitted he should have made further inquiries and not simply relied on the local member of parliament, even the prosecutor acknowledged that this had been a factor in his decision to clear the land. Perhaps more alarming was Boyle\u2019s claim in court that :\u201cThey [the National party representatives] also intervened on behalf of a number of farmers to prevent their prosecution by the [Office of Environment and Heritage].\u201d Despite multiple calls and emails over two weeks and approaches via the National party headquarters, Humphries did not respond to Guardian Australia. \u2018Too explosive\u2019 The ABC reported in 2015 that Humphries made representations to stop investigations on 12 properties in the Wee Waa area of New England, and Humphries himself boasted on his website that that he had intervened with the then environment minister, Mark Speakman, to suspend investigations into illegal land clearing in Wee Waa. A spokesman for the Minister said this is not the case, and the decision not to visit certain farms was an operational decision made by the Office of Environment and Heritage. Emails obtained by the ABC and reported by Guardian Australia showed Humphries telling the NSW environment department: \u201cI strongly urge that agencies do not seek to engage landholders on this particular issue at this time \u2013 it is too explosive and not warranted.\u201d The emails came less than a year after the 2014 murder of the Office of Environment and Heritage worker Glen Turner. He was killed by a farmer, Ian Turnbull, during a site inspection as part of an investigation into allegations of illegal land clearing. Internal OEH correspondence showed Humphries\u2019 email had been interpreted as a threat and the risk of \u201ccatastrophic\u201d consequences associated with an inspection was thought to be \u201cextreme\u201d. In one email an environment officer said: \u201cI am of the opinion that the comments of Mr Humphries amount to a threat which cannot be adequately assessed in the available time.\u201d The OEH later said the compliance visits in Wee Waa had been cancelled for \u201coperational reasons\u201d and were not dropped because of Humphries\u2019 email. Humphries has also been accused of causing confusion among farmers about water laws. During his trial this year for breaching the Water Management act, Anthony Barlow, a cotton grower from Burren Downs, gave evidence that at a meeting of water users on 25 March 2015 he was told personally by the then-water minister, Humphries, that a ban on pumping from the Barwon River had been lifted. Preston found that Humphries had given that erroneous advice during the meeting and that this had been corroborated by an employee of the Office of Water, who made a file note that the minister replied to a water user\u2019s question with: \u201cYou\u2019re not listening \u2026 there\u2019s no embargo.\u201d The judge said he had taken this into account in the sentencing. Humphries had previously denied making the statements to the ABC. Although the NSW government has announced it will not be launching new cases based on breaches of the old land clearing laws, there are a number of prosecutions before the courts, some involving large-scale land clearing of 1,000 hectares or more. It is not clear whether those cases will proceed. The \u201camnesty\u201d does not include land clearing that would be illegal under the new laws, according to the environment department\u2019s new prosecution policy. The government hopes that this concession will calm the anger among farmers who feel that they were hard done by under the old laws.",

All pieces start with Dickinson\u2019s designs. They\u2019re laser cut using solar power then hand-painted and assembled in her Melbourne studio. In the early days, Dickinson mainly sold at markets \u2013 now it\u2019s online and through stockists like GOMA, Melbourne Museum and (soon) The Iconic.

A bit like an Indigenous Spice Girls. \u201cIt\u2019s something I didn\u2019t have when I was little,\u201d Dickinson says.

Or sexy and assertive, Dickinson says. \u201cI get so many customers who say, \u2018When I put these earrings on I feel so good and I make so many friends.\u2019 I had one customer who bought some \u2018Fuck Off\u2019 bamboo hoops. Next week she came back and said, \u2018Oh my God! I wore those earrings out, I felt so hot and I had free drinks all night. And two marriage proposals!\u2019\u201d Dickinson is a proud Wiradjuri woman. As a child, connecting to culture meant time with her nan and her glamorous, accessory-loving mum, or heading off to Dubbo for holidays with the extended family. \u201cGoing up to the country when I was little and talking to my aunties, sitting up at the kitchen table and hearing them all yarning around, that was my connection to my Aboriginality,\u201d Dickinson says. But she also remembers getting teased for being Aboriginal, and crying when her mother tried to make her dress in black, yellow and red for a school flag costume day. It\u2019s one of those childhood memories that still makes Dickinson cringe. \u201cI just wish I could go back and shake that little girl and go, \u2018Be proud of who you are and make your mum proud. Don\u2019t ever be ashamed of who you are.\u2019\u201d Or maybe she should say: \u201cHey little Kristy \u2013 I make jewellery that remixes the best bits of our childhood, and adds in some stuff that was missing first time around.\u201d Wentworth star Rarriwuy Hick is another devotee, and sees Dickinson\u2019s work as empowerment: \u201cBeing an Indigenous woman and knowing what some of our daily obstacles can be, Kristy has used those struggles to empower us. But I don\u2019t see her just doing this for Indigenous women. She\u2019s doing it for the queer community, trans women, all women. It\u2019s a way to wear our voices on the body part that listens.\u201d Haus of Dizzy has a part-time assistant and an intern helping out now, but for most of the time since its 2015 launch the brand has been a solo operation. All pieces start with Dickinson\u2019s designs. They\u2019re laser cut using solar power then hand-painted and assembled in her Melbourne studio. In the early days, Dickinson mainly sold at markets \u2013 now it\u2019s online and through stockists like GOMA, Melbourne Museum and (soon) The Iconic. You\u2019ll still see her stall at Aboriginal events, though. And she makes time to run jewellery workshops at youth detention centres and domestic violence support centres. Dickinson talks a lot about instilling confidence in Indigenous children. As the daughter of a single mother, she says she never thought of owning a business. Dickinson financed it all herself \u2013 no loans, no grants \u2013 and hopes to be a role model for young people in her community. But if Dickinson is a symbol, then so is the stuff she makes. She tells the story of one tiny Haus of Dizzy fan who won\u2019t go to school without her \u201cDeadly\u201d necklace on. So Dickinson and Hammonds are also working together on Dizzy Chicks, a brand new children\u2019s range with stickers, clothing, merch and accessories. So far they\u2019re working on six cute brown girl characters with individual personalities. A bit like an Indigenous Spice Girls. \u201cIt\u2019s something I didn\u2019t have when I was little,\u201d Dickinson says. And then she laughs when asked how much Haus of Dizzy is really about feeding her inner child. \u201cAll of it!\u201d she screams.",

recognition of white supremacist/alt-right ideologies that fuel violent extremism\u201d.</p> <p>Aly noted that Asio had said a future extreme rightwing-inspired attack would most likely be committed by a lone actor or small group, adding that lone actors are \u201cmobilised through some kind of social network, usually through the internet\u201d such as chat spaces and gaming rooms.</p> <p>Aly said counter-terror agencies should be monitoring and evaluating people\u2019s public online behaviour for \u201ctell-tale signs\u201d, as many perpetrators of violence announce intentions ahead of acting.</p> <p>Australia needs to tackle rhetoric used to \u201cjustify and embolden\u201d rightwing extremism and to go through a process of introspection to identify \u201cthe kinds of attitudes that can normalise violence\u201d, she said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to turn the mirror on yourself \u2013 it\u2019s much easier when terrorism is committed by others, but when terrorism is committed by \u2018us\u2019, that\u2019s a much harder thing to accept.\u201d</p> <p>She said the response that the alleged Christchurch shooter is \u201cnot one of us\u201d is wrong. \u201cNo,

      "bodyText": "Labor MPs have welcomed spy agency Asio\u2019s recognition that the threat from extreme rightwing terrorism in Australia is on the rise but will now push the government to do more to counter the threat. On Thursday, Labor MP Anne Aly \u2013 a former academic specialising in countering violent extremism \u2013 said the recognition of the threat was \u201ca long time coming\u201d and suggested Australia had been slow to recognise the alleged Christchurch massacre shooter was \u201cone of us\u201d. Ed Husic questioned why Asio had not noted the links between rightwing extremists in the United States and Australia, and suggested the federal government spends \u201cmore money on government advertising than on countering violent extremism\u201d. In August, Husic wrote to the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, warning that the series of \u201chorrific mass shootings in the United States\u201d citing the Christchurch massacre as inspiration indicated that extremist violence was crossing borders and inspiring copycat attacks. \u201cOn Australian soil we have seen reports of escalating and brazen extremist white supremacist activity or public demonstrations of support for these extremist views, notably the far-right rally held in St Kilda earlier this year,\u201d Husic said. Aly has shared her expertise already with the New Zealand royal commission examining the Christchurch mosques attack and will meet the inquiry team again in November when they visit Australia ahead of delivering a report in December. Aly told Guardian Australia she had shared Asio\u2019s assessment of an increased risk in rightwing extremist violence for five years and welcomed \u201cthe recognition of white supremacist/alt-right ideologies that fuel violent extremism\u201d. Aly noted that Asio had said a future extreme rightwing-inspired attack would most likely be committed by a lone actor or small group, adding that lone actors are \u201cmobilised through some kind of social network, usually through the internet\u201d such as chat spaces and gaming rooms. Aly said counter-terror agencies should be monitoring and evaluating people\u2019s public online behaviour for \u201ctell-tale signs\u201d, as many perpetrators of violence announce intentions ahead of acting. Australia needs to tackle rhetoric used to \u201cjustify and embolden\u201d rightwing extremism and to go through a process of introspection to identify \u201cthe kinds of attitudes that can normalise violence\u201d, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to turn the mirror on yourself \u2013 it\u2019s much easier when terrorism is committed by others, but when terrorism is committed by \u2018us\u2019, that\u2019s a much harder thing to accept.\u201d She said the response that the alleged Christchurch shooter is \u201cnot one of us\u201d is wrong. \u201cNo, actually, he is [one of us],\u201d she said. The massacre of 49 people at two mosques in Christchurch in March, for which 28-year-old Australian Brenton Tarrant has been charged, prompted renewed scrutiny of the far right including by Australia\u2019s home affairs department. After the attacks, Scott Morrison called for less \u201cmindless tribalism\u201d in politics and for Australians to \u201cdisagree better\u201d but there has been little sense of collective responsibility in Australia despite the increased mobilisation of the far right. Husic said that Australia needed to take rightwing extremism more seriously, citing a trial in Victoria of a man charged with preparing a terrorist act against left wing and Muslim groups and an incident involving a man with a machete approaching a mosque at Holland Park in Brisbane. \u201cLast year alone we saw 50 terror-related deaths in the US overwhelmingly as the result of far right extremism,\u201d he told Sky News. Husic noted the Asio report had discussed international threats of terrorism from Europe, Asia and the Middle East but made \u201cno reference\u201d to the US which suggested there was \u201cvery little evidence\u201d it was watching events there which \u201cmight have an impact on us, because [the threat is] crossing borders\u201d. In the same annual report that it acknowledged the growing rightwing terror threat, Asio warned that its increasing workload from \u201cunprecedented\u201d levels of foreign interference and espionage is stretching its current resources. But on Thursday, Dutton played down the concern, telling reporters in Canberra that Asio\u2019s funding \u201cgoes up every year\u201d. \u201cWe will put more money in each year and, as I say, the staffing numbers grow each year,\u201d he said. \u201cLook, every agency head across the commonwealth wants more money into their agency, and every minister wants more money into their departments and their agencies.\u201d Husic said he would be \u201cvery concerned\u201d if agency requests for more resources to combat violent extremism were ignored. \u201cI urge the Coalition government to take this threat more seriously \u2026 If we can move quickly on farm protests we can also move on this.\u201d",

According to the Australian Institute of Criminology, Indigenous people made up 20% of all deaths in police custody between 1989-90 and 2016-17 but 22% of all motor vehicle deaths. According to evidence before the court, police did not identify Raymond Noel before the crash and his race, and at this stage, it is not included as a causal factor in the inquest scope. Raymond Noel was from a well-known Aboriginal family in Thornbury. At 6\u20198\u201d (203cm) tall, he stood out. His family called him \u201cBig Raymond\u201d, the \u201cgentle giant\u201d.

His father, Ray Thomas, is an award-winning artist whose work has been acquired by the National Gallery of Victoria. His family is arguing, through the Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service, for limitations to the discretion of police officers to start a pursuit. Those limitations have been put in place before, by Olle. Thomas sat in the front row of the coroners court on Wednesday, sandwiched between his son Frank and a family ally, and nodded as Olle addressed him. \u201cWe can\u2019t bring Raymond Noel back but we can learn lessons,\u201d Olle said. \u201cThat\u2019s the hope.\u201d Police pursuit policy In 2015 police reformed their pursuit policy in response to recommendations Olle made in an inquest into the death of Sarah Booth, a 17-year-old killed in a police pursuit in 2006. Olle\u2019s recommendations included a rule that police \u201cshould never pursue a vehicle simply because it is fleeing\u201d but must instead believe on \u201creasonable grounds\u201d that intercepting the vehicle was \u201cnecessary to prevent a serious risk to public health and safety\u201d.

Avon and Somerset police said they were investigating 50 suspected brothels in residential settings such as holiday flats. The force also said almost half of the intelligence reports about human trafficking and modern slavery it received in August centred on the exploitation of women and girls in off-street prostitution. Officers say brothels are being set up not only in Bristol and other urban centres but in the countryside. There have been reports of brothels being established close to the vast building site on the Somerset coast where the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station is taking shape. Sgt Emma Slade, who has responsibility for policing prostitution in Avon and Somerset, said: \u201cVulnerable women are being enslaved and exploited for sex within pop-up brothels. They are isolated and suffer terrible abuse. Many of the women are recruited and trafficked on false promises of legitimate work but find themselves in a very different circumstance.\u201d Slade said that when police carried out safeguarding visits to brothels, they often found women from the far east and eastern Europe who spoke no English and did not know the emergency services phone number. As of September, the force had identified and was investigating 76 suspected brothels, 26 of which were in commercial premises such as massage parlours and the rest in residential properties. Slade said officers relied on landlords, property owners, hosts and neighbours to report suspicious activity. \u201cWe would encourage property hosts or nearby residents to remain vigilant and report any activity that appears unusual or suspicious at short-term rental premises.

Operating from short-term and holiday rental properties instead of a permanent address makes it easier for those exploiting the girls and women to avoid detection. The properties can be easily booked online without the need for large deposits or for the tenants to meet the hosts during the stay. Supt Mark Edgington, the force\u2019s lead for modern slavery, said: \u201cPop-up brothels in short-term rental properties are increasingly being reported across the UK and it is important that property hosts are able to recognise the signs of potential modern slavery and sexual exploitation. \u201cMany hosts are completely unaware their properties could be used for this or the signs they should be looking out for.

This can give some assurance that the tenant is really who they say they are.\u201d The police said some of the signs to look out for were: Multiple women staying under one roof or a large number of women regularly being brought to and taken from the property. Different men calling at the property (both day and night) and staying for only a short period of time. Windows being blacked out or curtains left constantly closed. A sudden increase in residential waste at a property, or more waste than would be expected for the number of tenants. Occupants appearing malnourished, unkempt or withdrawn. Two years ago Devon and Cornwall police issued a similar warning to owners of holiday lets to beware of sex workers using their premises as pop-up brothels. The force said that in one resort alone, Newquay, they had discovered 14 such establishments in five months and believed more had operated but had not been discovered.",

      "body": "<p>They say a picture\u2019s worth a thousand words \u2013 but for Nancy Pelosi, one photo has had even more traction than that.</p> \n<p>When Donald Trump tweeted a photo of Pelosi standing tall in a room full of men, pointing the finger at him, he didn\u2019t seem to get the subtext. \u201cNervous Nancy\u2019s unhinged meltdown!\u201d he tweeted.</p> \n<p>But what came next was the latest example of Pelosi flipping the script on Trump: she uploaded the photo \u2013 in which she towers over Trump with her eyebrows raised \u2013 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SpeakerPelosi\">as her Twitter cover photo</a>.</p> \n<p>It is just one example of the House speaker\u2019s uncanny ability to use the president\u2019s own rhetoric against him. (Greta Thunberg deployed a similar trick last month when she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/24/greta-thunberg-trump-twitter-bio\">changed her Twitter bio</a> to quote Trump\u2019s mockery of her.) Pelosi\u2019s quick-fire \u2013 or perhaps cynical? \u2013 wit gets under the president\u2019s skin and has drawn in many admirers (even, in this case, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BillKristol/status/1184608067574550529\">Bill Kristol</a>).

But her standout moment came when, as the president spoke out against the \u201cpolitics of revenge\u201d, Pelosi stood to give him a slow, demeaning clap.</p> \n<p>The optics were completely on point \u2013 with Pelosi looking down on Trump, arms reached out and her lips all puckered up.

      "bodyText": "They say a picture\u2019s worth a thousand words \u2013 but for Nancy Pelosi, one photo has had even more traction than that. When Donald Trump tweeted a photo of Pelosi standing tall in a room full of men, pointing the finger at him, he didn\u2019t seem to get the subtext. \u201cNervous Nancy\u2019s unhinged meltdown!\u201d he tweeted. But what came next was the latest example of Pelosi flipping the script on Trump: she uploaded the photo \u2013 in which she towers over Trump with her eyebrows raised \u2013 as her Twitter cover photo. It is just one example of the House speaker\u2019s uncanny ability to use the president\u2019s own rhetoric against him. (Greta Thunberg deployed a similar trick last month when she changed her Twitter bio to quote Trump\u2019s mockery of her.) Pelosi\u2019s quick-fire \u2013 or perhaps cynical? \u2013 wit gets under the president\u2019s skin and has drawn in many admirers (even, in this case, Bill Kristol). Here are other times she turned the tables: 1 The slow clap Pelosi stole the limelight from Trump during his State of the Union speech, punctuating his speech with animated eye-rolls and, at one point, flicking through paperwork while he spoke. But her standout moment came when, as the president spoke out against the \u201cpolitics of revenge\u201d, Pelosi stood to give him a slow, demeaning clap. The optics were completely on point \u2013 with Pelosi looking down on Trump, arms reached out and her lips all puckered up. The clap became the jump-pad for a million memes of similar exaggerated praise, with captions such as \u201cwhen a guy on Tinder tells you he\u2019s read a TON of books by women\u201d and \u201cwhen I tell my wife I changed a diaper\u201d. Great job, hon. 2 The air-quotes September was a dreary, dreary month. As reports circulated showing that there had been more shootings than days in 2019, people were growing restless over government inaction. Then, at a press conference, when Pelosi was asked about Trump\u2019s plans on gun reform, she quipped \u201cyou want me to tell you what goes on in the presidents\u2026 \u2018mind\u2019?\u201d \u2013 bracketing the word slowly and carefully with hooked fingers. 3 \u2018Send her back\u2019 July was a particularly racist month for Trump, who targeted four congresswomen of color \u2013 Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib \u2013 saying they should \u201cgo back\u201d to where they came from. The four women are all US citizens. Omar has lived in the US for most of her life, having migrated as a Somalian refugee when she was eight, which many pointed out is longer than the president\u2019s own wife. Then, at a rally in North Carolina when Trump repeated misleading claims about Omar\u2019s comments on al-Qaida, he was received by chants of \u201csend her back\u201d. Nancy Pelosi wasn\u2019t going to let him off the hook, however. During a congressional trip to Uganda, Pelosi and Omar posed for a photoshoot, two holding hands in front of a memorial to the trans-Atlantic slave trade. Omar captioned it: \u201cThey said \u2018send her back\u2019 but Speaker @SpeakerPelosi didn\u2019t just make arrangements to send me back, she went back with me,\u201d adding: \u201cSo grateful for the honor to return to Mother Africa.\u201d 4. The orange coat When the Democrats won the house in the 2018 midterms, something dawned on Trump: funding his golden pledge \u2013 a border wall with Mexico \u2013 wasn\u2019t going to be easy. In December, he threatened to shut down the government if the Democrats didn\u2019t comply. Pelosi called his bluff. A televised shouting match between the two ensued, which ended in Trump committing to the shutdown. The Democrats took it as a victory \u2013 and proof of the president\u2019s astonishing ability to repeatedly cut off his own nose to spite his face. The real win, however, was the shot of Pelosi walking out of the meeting moments after, smirking in sunglasses and a big coral coat. As the Boston Globe put it at the time, she was channeling some \u201cserious big coat energy\u201d.",

The prime minister had been seeking to pitch Saturday\u2019s vote in the Commons as a choice between deal or no deal after coming to an agreement with the EU. Johnson was helped by comments from Jean-Claude Juncker casting doubt on the possibility of a further Brexit delay, but the heads of state and government did not follow the European commission president\u2019s lead. A summit communique issued after two hours of discussion tasked the commission and European parliament with taking \u201cthe necessary steps to ensure that the agreement can enter into force on November 1\u201d. But a senior EU official said that the leaders would follow events on Saturday, and reflect on the next steps if they were in a \u201cdifferent situation\u201d. A second diplomatic source said they had chosen not to interfere in a \u201csensitive domestic debate \u2026 but they leave the door open to the possibility of an extension, to be discussed at a later stage \u2013 if required\u201d.

      "bodyText": "A group of homeless people who bed down in a tube tunnel near parliament have accused the chaplain to the Speaker of the House of Commons, Rose Hudson-Wilkin, of driving them out of their only home after complaining to security officials about their \u201congoing stench\u201d. They wrote to the chaplain on Thursday, saying their lives had taken a turn for the worse since she complained about them, having been expelled from \u201cthe closest thing we had to a home\u201d. The New Statesman obtained parliamentary email exchanges written in February detailing a complaint from Hudson-Wilkin, the Speaker\u2019s chaplain since 2010, to parliamentary security officials about the \u201congoing stench\u201d created by about 20 rough sleepers in the underground entrance used to access parliament from Westminster tube station. She said the tunnel \u2013 which she said was being used as a urinal \u2013 was \u201cabsolutely filthy\u201d and expressed concern that piled-up bedding could pose a security risk. While devastated to learn of the deaths of at least two homeless people at the station, she said while it was \u201cheartbreaking that we have people sleeping by the underground entrance\u201d, action needed to be taken. The letter to Hudson-Wilkin, who in November will become the Church of England\u2019s first black female bishop, of Dover, said the homeless people had been upset by her \u201churtful remarks\u201d. Hudson-Wilkin told the Guardian: \u201cI have not yet received this letter. When I do I will be very happy to respond to whoever has written to me. In 21st-century Britain nobody should have to sleep outdoors in conditions like that.\u201d When the story of her complaint first broke, she said: \u201cWe may find it unpleasant and concerning to walk through the underground station on the way to work or home, but for those who have to live like this \u2013 forgotten and overlooked by society \u2013 it is so much worse. Nobody should have to live like this.\u201d She added that \u201cmoving people on\u201d would not solve the problem. However, shortly after, the rough sleepers said they were forced out of their tunnel and were now sleeping outside. The letter is signed \u201cPaul Westminster\u201d and has been written on behalf of the group sleeping in the tunnel. Paul sells the Big Issue at one of the entrances to the station. According to the group, soon after Hudson-Wilkin lodged her complaint they were served with community protection notices which threatened them with fines of \u00a320,000 if they continued to sleep in the tunnel. \u201cOur belongings were taken and thrown away without warning, sleeping bags and all. We were harassed under the 1824 Vagrancy Act and then without a warning given, a grate was installed expelling us from the best shelter in the area and the closest thing we had to a home. The tunnel now sits warm and empty and unused at night while we sleep outside,\u201d they said. They told the Guardian that as well as losing their sleeping place they were distressed at the assumption they were the reason behind the \u201congoing stench\u201d. They said the smell of urine was not due to them but to people coming out of pubs around parliament late in the evening. They said they tried to prevent the drinkers from urinating in the place they considered to be their home and did their best to keep the area clean and tidy. \u201cYou presumed that we were using our subway as a urinal when in fact we prevented other people from doing so because we had made our home there,\u201d the letter said. It cited Proverbs 21:13: \u201cIf a man shuts his ears to the cry of the poor he too will cry out and not be answered.\u201d It is the latest in a series of conflicts between homeless people in the area and parliament. Recently, parliament apologised to a group of rough sleepers who bed down close to the Palace of Westminster after taking individual photos of them without their permission while they slept. The parliamentary estate has effectively evicted them by installing shutters to mark parliament\u2019s new boundary, following a transfer of land from Transport for London. Rough sleeping in the London borough of Westminster increased by 16% between April 2018 and March 2019. During that period, outreach workers recorded 2,512 people sleeping rough, compared with 2,165 the previous year. A spokesperson for the Labour Homelessness Campaign said: \u201cThe rough sleepers in the Westminster tunnels deserve to be treated as human beings. Instead they were stigmatised, criminalised and evicted from what should be public space. The Westminster eviction should be reversed and parliament should take responsibility for ensuring the people living on its doorstep get housing and support.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 18 October 2019 to clarify that Rose Hudson-Wilkin is set to become the Church of England\u2019s first black female bishop, not first black bishop as an earlier version said.",

All Labour MPs must vote against it. The deal also threatens to Balkanise Britain. Northern Ireland is, for example, exempted from the evil consequences of a US-UK trade deal \u2013 from the entry of chlorinated chicken to the contracting out of NHS services \u2013 while Scotland, Wales and England would be bound in.</p> <p>By the way he has chosen to resolve one source of division, the Northern Ireland border, Johnson appears hellbent on creating another that nationalists are already seeking to exploit.

Instead it looks like D-day in reverse: a divided, broken-down country retreating from the Europe it once helped to save; and instead of taking control of its future, losing control to the point that it may no longer be able to hold itself together. So when parliament meets on Saturday, the central issue is no longer just what kind of Brexit we have, but what kind of Britain we want to become \u2013 and whether there is to be a Britain at all. And the question each party has to ask is: what will it take to heal the wounds of a country now so rent asunder that it qualifies as having many of the features of a failed state?</p> <p>If the debate on Saturday, and in the coming election campaign, fixates on the two extremes now before us \u2013 the Johnson deal and an equally hardline \u201crevoke\u201d \u2013 we will only exacerbate our bitter divisions. Just as the Conservatives now discount the views of the 16.1 million who voted remain, so too the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/15/lib-dems-pledge-to-revoke-brexit-without-referendum\" title=\"\"> Liberal Democrats\u2019 plan to nullify the 2016 referendum </a>without a further peoples\u2019 vote dismisses the concerns of the 17.4 million who voted leave. So it falls to Labour \u2013 a remain party that has always acknowledged the real anxieties of leave voters \u2013 to set out a path to reunite Britain. The current position of negotiating a better leave package and following it with a second referendum should be updated in the light of Johnson\u2019s existential challenge to the UK. Labour must now propose \u2013 and recommend \u2013 a renegotiated remain option as well before giving the British people the final say.</p> <p>There were, of course, many concerns raised in 2016 by Brexit voters: the state of our manufacturing and our industrial towns and a general feeling that our politicians had let us down and lost the plot in the post-imperial era. But the central demands of Brexiteers \u2013 directly relevant to our EU membership \u2013 were to take back control of our borders and our laws. These demands can now be seen in a new light. In their 2016 negotiations the Conservatives failed \u2013 whether out of ignorance, idleness or simply sheer stupidity \u2013 to examine in detail the national freedoms already exercised by the Germans, French, Italians and others within EU law.

      "bodyText": "There is a real risk that the coming general election could be the United Kingdom\u2019s last \u2013 with Boris Johnson remembered only for being its last Conservative prime minister. Johnson\u2019s deal is, we now know, even more fatally flawed than Theresa May\u2019s in vital respects: it threatens to make Ireland a smugglers\u2019 and tax avoiders\u2019 paradise and ushers in a race to the bottom in social and environmental standards. All Labour MPs must vote against it. The deal also threatens to Balkanise Britain. Northern Ireland is, for example, exempted from the evil consequences of a US-UK trade deal \u2013 from the entry of chlorinated chicken to the contracting out of NHS services \u2013 while Scotland, Wales and England would be bound in. By the way he has chosen to resolve one source of division, the Northern Ireland border, Johnson appears hellbent on creating another that nationalists are already seeking to exploit. He is jeopardising, perhaps to the point of its destruction, Scotland\u2019s 300-year-old union with England and thus the very existence of the UK. So the looming exit is shaping up not as the Dunkirk moment imagined by Brexiteers, with the whole country coming together as one, rolling up its sleeves and glorying in isolation as, united, it faces the foe. Instead it looks like D-day in reverse: a divided, broken-down country retreating from the Europe it once helped to save; and instead of taking control of its future, losing control to the point that it may no longer be able to hold itself together. So when parliament meets on Saturday, the central issue is no longer just what kind of Brexit we have, but what kind of Britain we want to become \u2013 and whether there is to be a Britain at all. And the question each party has to ask is: what will it take to heal the wounds of a country now so rent asunder that it qualifies as having many of the features of a failed state? If the debate on Saturday, and in the coming election campaign, fixates on the two extremes now before us \u2013 the Johnson deal and an equally hardline \u201crevoke\u201d \u2013 we will only exacerbate our bitter divisions. Just as the Conservatives now discount the views of the 16.1 million who voted remain, so too the Liberal Democrats\u2019 plan to nullify the 2016 referendum without a further peoples\u2019 vote dismisses the concerns of the 17.4 million who voted leave. So it falls to Labour \u2013 a remain party that has always acknowledged the real anxieties of leave voters \u2013 to set out a path to reunite Britain. The current position of negotiating a better leave package and following it with a second referendum should be updated in the light of Johnson\u2019s existential challenge to the UK. Labour must now propose \u2013 and recommend \u2013 a renegotiated remain option as well before giving the British people the final say. There were, of course, many concerns raised in 2016 by Brexit voters: the state of our manufacturing and our industrial towns and a general feeling that our politicians had let us down and lost the plot in the post-imperial era. But the central demands of Brexiteers \u2013 directly relevant to our EU membership \u2013 were to take back control of our borders and our laws. These demands can now be seen in a new light. In their 2016 negotiations the Conservatives failed \u2013 whether out of ignorance, idleness or simply sheer stupidity \u2013 to examine in detail the national freedoms already exercised by the Germans, French, Italians and others within EU law. We were, and still are, free to make new choices. First, it is possible to regain more control of our borders. We could do as Germany does: register migrant workers as they arrive; or, as Belgium does, impose a time limit on any stay without work. In high-unemployment areas, new jobs could first be advertised at local job centres, as in Switzerland. And to stop unfair labour-market competition, whereby the good employer is undercut by the bad, and the bad by the worst, we could end, as France has done since 2016, the practice of \u201csocial dumping\u201d and embrace the new German proposal for a European-wide minimum wage. All these objectives are implementable within the general EU principles of freedom of movement alongside enhanced social and environmental rights. Second, we can ease worries that we have lost control of our laws. We can take more control of our laws in a manner consistent with EU law through domestic legal reform which guarantees the supremacy of the UK constitution. To establish immediate constitutional protections, parliament can issue a \u201csovereignty declaration\u201d which affirms the UK\u2019s commitment to preserving its constitutional identity in its application of EU law. It could then pass a \u201csovereignty statute\u201d to guarantee the supremacy of the UK constitution. All this is totally consistent with article 4 (2) of the treaty of Lisbon which requires the EU to respect \u201cnational identities\u201d. So there is a reformed remain offer readily available that I am confident Europe will accept, and which puts not just a botched Brexit \u2013 with all its angst, idiocy, and grave economic risks \u2013 behind us, but also rejects revoke as a pseudo-solution. Instead we can move ahead confidently, renegotiating \u2013 not from weakness, but from strength \u2013 a bold new plan to make Europe work for Britain. For, as this week\u2019s events have demonstrated, it is the ultimate destiny of Britain that will be on the ballot paper when next we vote: whether under a government that looks more and more like the rump of a once national party, we are to be an inward-looking, anti-immigrant, intolerant country, intoxicated by isolation and fragmented by four nationalisms; or whether we are to emerge as a Britain that is outward-looking, tolerant, inclusive and pragmatic, renewing our character as a multinational state, and once again an engaged and visionary leader on the European and the world stage. \u2022 Gordon Brown was UK prime minister from 2007 to 2010",

      "bodyText": "After a choppy session, the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares has closed 0.2% higher at 7,182 points, up 14 points. Top risers included firms with a high exposure to the UK economy, including TUI (+2.3%), J Sainsbury (+1.8%) and Next (+1.6%). Some multinationals lost ground, though, as the pound\u2019s recent strength erodes the value of their overseas earnings. Packaging firms Mondi and DS Smith both fell 5%, followed by rival Smurfit Kappa (-3.5%). Seema Shah, Chief Strategist at Principal Global Investors, has some predictions about where the pound might go next: Negative positioning suggests that, if the deal passes on Saturday, you could see another climb in the pound to around $1.35-$1.40. A return to the pre-referendum $1.50 remains unlikely - after all, the endless negotiations and haze of uncertainty of the past three years has taken its toll on the UK economy. The UK will still likely endure some economic pain on leaving the EU, even with a deal. If the deal fails on Saturday, you could see sterling re-testing lows of $1.20. Looking beyond that, if a \u2018no-deal Brexit\u2019 once again rears its ugly head, a level of $1.10 or below would be likely. Labour\u2019s shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, is unhappy that this new Brexit deal means a more distant economic relationship with the EU: Even if Johnson\u2019s deal is passed on Saturday (unlikely, but not impossible), the City won\u2019t know its long-term relationship with the EU. Jonas Lindqvist, Head of Product Strategy for Principal Trading at trading platform Itiviti, explains: \u201cThe champagne may well be on ice in Number 10 having reached a \u2018new deal\u2019, but the long-term effects of Brexit on European market infrastructure are still unknown. Agreeing the terms of exit, which still has to go through the House of Commons, is simply transitioning from one political relationship to another. What firms are really craving is intricate details into exactly how trading on European financial markets will function. In theory, recognition of third-country regulatory equivalence should be fairly straightforward. The UK has, after all, already implemented rules such as MiFID II. That said, there is still a huge amount of uncertainty as to what this will look like in practice. During the transition period, there needs to be a clear and detailed framework for EU based firms to easily operate in the City. At least in the midst of this political psychodrama, it has been encouraging to see ESMA and the FCA both attempting to keep things as stable as possible.\u201d Ricardo Evangelista, senior analyst at ActivTrades, says the DUP\u2019s opposition has punctured the pound\u2019s rally. A roller-coaster day for the pound with it almost reaching $1.30 following the announcement of a Brexit deal between the EU and the UK only to then lose all of the day\u2019s gains in the aftermath of the refusal by the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party to back such an agreement. It is widely assumed that without the support of the of DUP the deal is condemned to be voted down by parliament, as the hard Brexit wings of the Conservative Party made their support conditional to the deal being accepted by the DUP. In practical terms this means that a new extension to the exit date is now more likely. As a consequence the pound erased earlier gains and is now unlikely to test the $1.30 resistance level again, at least not until there is another clear solution within sight. Kristalina Georgieva has also warned that the difference between a Brexit deal and no deal was \u201cquite dramatic\u201d. The IMF has estimated that leaving without a deal would cost the U.K. between 3.5% and 5% of GDP, and knock 0.5% off EU GDP as well. The Fund\u2019s new managing director says: \u201cThat\u2019s quite significant.\u201d No wonder she \u2018jumped\u2019 with excitement when Johnson and Juncker announced they\u2019d reached a deal earlier today. Georgieva also told reporters in Washington that there would still be implications from leaving with a deal but they would be \u201csignificantly more modest\u201d -- knocking around 2% off GDP. She added: \u201cA lot of that impact has already been absorbed because anticipation of the U.K. leaving has been built over the past 3 years.\u201d More comments from the IMF\u2019s new chief: Kristalina Georgieva, the new managing director of the IMF, is also pleased that the UK and EU have reached a new Brexit deal. Speaking at the Fund\u2019s annual meeting in Washington, she says: \u201cThis is good news. This is welcome. Just like the pound which jumped, when I saw the news I jumped. I would very much like to see an agreement being reached\u201d I wouldn\u2019t dare predict how Brexit will play out. But City analysts have to calculate these things. And Oliver Harvey, macro strategist at Deutsche Bank, has estimated that there\u2019s a 55% chance that MPs will reject this new Brexit deal on Saturday. But what happens next? Assuming it\u2019s not ratified, Harvey sees four ways it could play out -- including Johnson winning a general election and then pushing his deal through parliament. Confirmatory referendum before election: 10% General election leads to Johnson\u2019s deal: 25% General election leads to no deal Brexit: 10% General election leads to second referendum: 10% But he cautions that there is \u201cconsiderable uncertainty\u201d about how a November election would play out. Some opinion polls suggest a substantial Conservative lead while others show a smaller lead. In general, however, the Conservatives\u2019 polling performance has improved since Mr Johnson became leader. Importantly, and as discussed above, only one scenario would reintroduce the risk of a no deal Brexit: that of the Conservatives forming a minority government with the support of the Brexit Party/DUP. David Malpass, the World Bank president, says a Brexit deal will be good for poor countries because it will end the uncertainty that has led to slower growth. \u201cIf there were clarity it would help the growth outlook quite a bit\u201d Malpass said at a press conference in Washington. Malpass explained that problems in advanced economies have rippled across the globe: \u201cUncertainty affects development because part of the slowdown in the developing world is related to the slowdown in the developed world. Europe has slowed significantly. If there was more certainty that would be very helpful.\u201d Even by recent standards, this has been a very volatile day for the pound. It\u2019s traded in a range of nearly two and half cents against the US dollar today, as hopes of a Brexit breakthrough surged, then subsided. The pound has also fallen back against the euro. Having hit a five-month high this morning, sterling is now down three-quarters of a eurocent at \u20ac1.151. Traders are concluding that MPs may well not pass Johnson\u2019s deal on Saturday. Passing a Brexit deal would be \u201cconstructive\u201d for the UK\u2019s credit rating, says S&amp;P. The credit rating agency currently has a \u2018negative\u2019 rating on Britain, essentially a threat to downgrade the country - potentially pushing up borrowing costs. S&amp;P has already downgraded the UK after the 2016 EU referendum, due to the damage that Brexit could cause. European sovereign debt analyst Frank Gill told Reuters: \u201cThis is constructive news, also for the rating,\u201d Ultimately [the rating] it is going to come down to how the economy performs.\u201d \u201cEven with a deal you still have enormous questions about, for example, UK financial services firms\u2019 access to the (EU) single market.\u201d The City\u2019s Brexit optimism is now firmly fizzling out, as the DUP insists it won\u2019t back Johnson\u2019s deal. The pound has dropped steadily in recent minutes, and is now back below $1.28, down almost half a cent today (and two cents below its peak this morning). One important point. Boris Johnson\u2019s new Brexit deal is based on a looser relationship with the EU than Theresa May\u2019s ill-fated Withdrawal Agreement. Michael Gove, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, just described it as \u2018Canada plus plus plus\u201d. That effectively means a free trade agreement (FTA) with less need to conform to EU regulations, but also potentially less access - or more barriers - to EU markets. Last year, the Treasury analysed various potential Brexit deals and concluded that a FTA caused more economic damage than the May plan [which itself delivered less growth than staying in the EU]. Brexit hopes are lifting equities across Europe, pushing the pan-European Stoxx 600 up by 0.3% at lunchtime (although this isn\u2019t a day for long lunches!). Not for the first time, Brexit optimism is fading a little. The pound has lost some of its early gains, and now back below $1.29 - as MPs assess whether they\u2019ll give their approval to this new deal. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says his party won\u2019t back it. Significantly, DUP officials are also saying they won\u2019t vote for the plan -- which could be a serious blow to Boris Johnson\u2019s hopes (as he lacks a majority). Brexit party leader Nigel Farage (an MEP, not an MP), isn\u2019t happy with Boris Johnson\u2019s work either -- he wants a general election instead: But what about Johnson\u2019s own side? Conservative MP Andrea Jenkyns has tweeted some support, but hasn\u2019t made her mind up yet: Another pro-Brexit MP, Iain Duncan Smith, says he has \u201csome issues\u201d. Paul Dales of Capital Economics predicts further sterling gains, if parliament votes through this new Brexit deal. He told clients: If a deal is passed, then we suspect that the pound could rise further from $1.29 now to about $1.35 and a reduction in uncertainty would result in a gradual rebound in business investment boosting GDP growth from 1.3% this year to around 1.5% next year and to about 2.2% in 2020. Business leaders are expressing some relief that the UK and EU have reached a Brexit deal, despite uncertainty over what it is...and whether it will pass. Jonathan Geldart, Director General of the Institute of Directors, says there is \u201cguarded relief\u201d at this breakthrough -- and called on MPs to avoid a no-deal Brexit: \u201cBusiness, particularly in Northern Ireland, will want to examine the detail more fully before coming to a firm view, but they will be pleased that UK and EU leaders have made steps toward common ground. \u201cAs MPs study the draft deal, they must keep firmly in mind the damage a disorderly exit could cause businesses large and small. A further extension offers no guarantees of avoiding this outcome, but if a passable deal is in touching distance then politicians on all sides should be pragmatic about giving us the time to get there. \u201cIf the immediate choice is between leaving the EU in an orderly versus a disorderly manner, politicians must be mindful of the longer-term consequences their actions may bring to bear.\u201d Mike Cherry of the Federation of Small Businesses says it\u2019s extremely important to avoid a no-deal on 31 October -- jobs and businesses depend on it. If the deal is passed \u2013 focus needs to turn quickly to the future relationship and ensuring that lessons are learnt from the experience of the last three years. \u201cMany small businesses are just about surviving - not only do they desperately need certainty but they also need the Government to get back to business and focus on meeting the many domestic challenges that have fallen behind Brexit.\u201d News of a Brexit deal has sent shares in some UK-focused companies sharply higher. The FTSE 250, which is a good barometer of the UK economy, has jumped by 0.6% to a new one-year high. Across the market, banks and house-builders are rallying hard, on hopes that a no-deal Brexit can be avoided. On the blue-chip FTSE 100 index, Persimmon, Barclays, Next, RBS and Lloyds are all up over 2%, extending their recent gains. The pound is sitting proudly over $1.29 right now, but it could plunge on Monday if parliament rejects this new Brexit deal when MPs meet on Saturday. Craig Erlam of trading firm OANDA says sterling could face more shocks: Anyone hoping that the process will be straightforward now is kidding themselves. With Labour whipping for a second referendum on the deal and the Lib Dems unlikely to support anything, there is still a good chance we\u2019re heading for an extension and election, in order to get this over the line. Nothing in Brexit is ever simple. It\u2019s going to be a wild weekend which will make the market open next week all the more unpredictable. If the deal gets through Parliament, the pound could perform extremely well at the start of next week, despite having already rebounded more than 8% from the lows a month ago. Important Brexit news: Brussels and London say they\u2019ve agreed the terms of a deal for the UK to leave the European Union. EC chief Jean-Claude Juncker and UK prime minister Boris Johnson have both announced that an agreement has been reached -- putting the ball back into parliament\u2019s court. This breakthrough has given sterling a big lift: up another cent in the last few minutes. This has sent the pound surging through the $1.29 mark against the US dollar for the first time since May. However... we\u2019ve still not seen the text of what\u2019s been agreed, and it\u2019s not clear that the DUP will accept it (given their concerns over customs controls and consent). Andy Sparrow\u2019s Politics Live blog has all the details on another dramatic day: British consumers are still spending, despite Brexit uncertainty, but there are signs of a slowdown... Retail spending only rose by 0.6% in July-September, the Office for National Statistics reports, compared to April-June. Sales in September alone were unchanged compared to August, with food spending up but department stores suffering again. But on an annual basis, spending is up over 3% year-on-year.. Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at PwC, says the next few months could be tricky: With declining high street footfall and continued Brexit uncertainty weighing on some consumers minds, retailers continue to brace themselves for a tough Christmas. \u201cWhatever the political and economic outcome, retailers and leisure operators need to keep their heads held high and hold their nerve, and focus not just on discounting but on continuing to get the basics right.\u201d Michael Biemann, CEO of digital property lender Selina Finance, is concerned that default rates on unsecured loans are rising, according to the Bank of England this morning. \u201cIt\u2019s a concern that default rates on credit cards and loans rose in the third quarter, and equally worrying that lenders expect even more people to start having problems with their repayments in the upcoming quarter. With money so cheap, there is a lot of debt out there and the worry is that for some people it is starting to prove too much, and at just the wrong time as we enter a potentially tough period for the economy..... Biemann also fears that Brexit uncertainty is forcing more businesses to default on their loans. Default rates to businesses of all sizes also rose between July and September, with lenders expecting this trend to accelerate further in the final three months of the year. While there are many reasons why businesses start to struggle, the impact of Brexit uncertainty cannot be ignored and is likely to be the deciding factor in the current cycle.\u201d Economist Rupert Seggins is also concerned by today\u2019s data: The drop in business lending shows that UK companies are cutting back on investment, says Andy Bruce of Reuters: Worryingly, the Bank of England has found that more companies and individuals defaulted on their loans in the third quarter in 2019 -- and the situation is likely to get worse. Its credit conditions survey found that: Net percentage balance for changes in default rates for total unsecured lending increased in Q3. This was driven by an increase in defaults for both credit card and other loans (see chart below). Lenders expected default rates for total unsecured lending to increase slightly in Q4. The net percentage balance for changes in default rates on loans to corporates increased for small, medium and large businesses in Q3. These balances for defaults were expected to increase for businesses of all sizes in Q4. Newsflash: Banks are planning to offer FEWER loans to businesses in the next few months, despite NatWest\u2019s offer of more lending this morning. UK lenders\u2019 expectations of the availability of business loans has fallen sharply, to the lowest level since the financial crisis. That\u2019s according to the Bank of England\u2019s credit conditions survey, just released. Its gauge of likely loan availability tumbled to -13.5% for the October-December quarter, the weakest since early 2008 (when the credit crunch was biting). The BoE explains: It found that: The overall availability of credit to the corporate sector was reported to have remained unchanged in Q3, and this was the case for small, medium and large businesses (Chart 2). The overall availability of credit to the corporate sector was expected to decrease in Q4. Why? It appears that the banks are reacting to caution among their own customers. The BoE\u2019s survey found that lenders expect demand for corporate lending to fall in the current quarter too, with medium-sized businesses particularly reluctant to borrow more. That implies that companies are resisting new investment, or expansions, while they await clarity on Brexit. Bloomberg has written about the support available to UK businesses facing Brexit worries: Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc is running Brexit clinics in the hope of soothing concerns that small and mid-sized businesses aren\u2019t ready for what awaits them. RBS\u2019s NatWest bank is holding meetings across the country, coaching businesses on how to face disruption to trade, workers or data flows once the U.K. leaves the European Union, it said in a press release on Thursday. The bank is also making \u00a38.2bn ($10.5 billion) in loans available to support small businesses during Brexit, up from the \u00a36bn pounds it previously announced. Building supplies group Grafton has issued a profits warning, blaming weaker demand in the UK (among other issues). The company, which sells bricks, timber, cement, roof tiles, paint and bathroom fittings, told shareholders it has suffered \u201ca softening in activity\u201d in recent weeks. Grafton says: Volumes in the UK merchanting business were affected by weak underlying demand fundamentals as households deferred discretionary spending on home improvement projects against the backdrop of increased economic uncertainty. That implies that UK customers have been holding off moving house, or improving their homes, until they have clarity over Brexit. Grafton shares have plunged 10% in early trading, the biggest faller on the FTSE 250 index. WH Smith, the high street and travel hub retailer, has been stockpiling products in case of Brexit disruption. It told the City this morning: The Group is prepared for Brexit and has put in place contingency plans to manage the impact, including increasing the stock of convenience products. Smiths also reported a 2% drop in revenues at its high street shops, although that was cushioned by a 3% rise in sales at airports and railway stations (which are more profitable too). It\u2019s also landed a \u00a3300m deal to buy US travel retailer Marshall Retail, which runs outlets at American casino resorts and airport. Brexit uncertainty has sent the pound lurching around this morning. Sterling tumbled back from last night\u2019s five-month high, after the DUP party rejected the deal being drawn up between Boris Johnson and the European Union. DUP support is crucial to Johnson\u2019s hopes of persuading parliament to back his revised deal. But, they\u2019re unhappy about the proposed customs checks at the Irish Sea, the way VAT would be handled across the border after Brexit, and Northern Ireland\u2019s ability to consent to the arrangements. This wiped a cent of the pound in early London trading, but it\u2019s creeping back towards $1.28 -- and still up around six cents in a week. The UK government has welcomed NatWest\u2019s \u00a32.2bn boost for firms struggling with Brexit. Small business minister Kelly Tolhurst says: \u201cFinancial support from banks is often crucial to the success of an SME. So it is great to see NatWest reaffirming support for their business customers through our new SME Finance Charter. \u201cNatWest\u2019s commitments of continued and proactive support will give their SME customers the confidence they need ahead of Brexit on 31 October and beyond - with opportunities to thrive, grow and scale up in new markets.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. With the Brexit deadline less than 15 days away, British businesses are adopting the brace position. Some are stockpiling vital goods in case of long queues at the ports, while others are frantically brushing up on exports rules so they can keep shipping goods and offering services across the channel. But however much preparation they put in, disruption may be inevitable \u2014 especially in a disorderly no-deal Brexit. This morning, NatWest Bank has warned that thousands of its customers are particularly vulnerable to the fog of Brexit uncertainty enveloping the UK. The bank, part of Royal Bank of Scotland, is boosting its support fund by another \u00a32.2bn to protect UK firms from Brexit damage. That raises the pot of funding to \u00a38.2bn. It explains: \u201cThrough its on-going Brexit Customer Outreach Programme, NatWest has identified several thousand customers who may be the most impacted by the Brexit uncertainties, and has committed to proactively contacting those customers to help with their needs.\u201d The bank is also pledging to \u201csupport customers through Brexit\u201d \u2014 which hopefully means some understanding and leniency if a firm\u2019s cashflow suddenly clogs up, or sales take a dive. NatWest is also holding events around the country for nervous business leaders to discuss their concerns about Brexit (and other issues too, of course). That \u00a38.2bn is billed as a \u201cGrowth Funding\u201d package -- speak to business leaders, and many will point out that Brexit is the biggest factor holding back growth and investment. Paul Thwaite, NatWest\u2019s managing director for Commercial Banking, says there\u2019s \u201ca lot to do\u201d to get ready for Brexit: \u201cDuring a time of such uncertainty, it is imperative that we do all we can to support our customers. Our business customers are extremely busy, and there is a lot to do. This is why we wanted to go to them offering our support in a proactive way. We are very much open for business and want to be the bank that supports the UK\u2019s businesses through this uncertain time.\u201d The pound remains highly volatile, as traders try to assess the chances of a deal. It hit a five-month high of $1.2875 last night, but has fallen by over a cent since, as the government struggles to persuade the DUP party to support it. With EU leaders gathering for a crucial summit in Brussels today, sterling will surely be highly volatile today...

      "bodyText": "The new Brexit deal is essentially the old Brexit deal with a new chapter on the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland and a few key tweaks to the political declaration. The main protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland runs to just 15 pages \u2013 64 pages including the annexes \u2013 and restates the commitment to all the baseline elements on the Good Friday agreement, the common travel area and other rights contained in Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement of 2018. Here is a link to the full text with a summary of the key new points below. The backstop is replaced Overall the backstop has essentially been replaced by a full stop whereby Northern Ireland remains aligned to the EU from the end of the transition period for at least four years. A change can only happen if it is voted on by the Stormont assembly (more of that later). As Jonathan Powell, Tony Blair\u2019s chief negotiator in the Good Friday agreement, tweeted: \u201cThe funny side of the No 10 claim they have got rid of the backstop is that they have in fact transformed it from a fallback into the definitive future arrangement for NI with the province remaining in the single market and customs union\u201d. Consent Stormont will have a key role in future Brexit arrangements. And if there is cross-community support to remain aligned to the EU rather than the UK the consent will hold for eight years. The arrangements in this deal will automatically kick in for a mandated four years if there is a breakdown in trade talks, so it remains a \u201cbackstop\u201d but with a permanent tinge. That four-year period will start at the end of December 2020. Two months before the end of the four-year period, that is October 2024, Stormont will be asked to vote on whether to remain aligned to the EU in ways outlined by this deal or not. Assembly members will then be given the opportunity to effectively roll the deal over by a period of four or eight years. If the vote is carried by a simple majority of one or more, the alignment will kick in for another four years. However, \u201cwhere the decision reached in a given period had cross-community support\u201d the deal would roll over for an eight-year period. The majority in the protocol for cross-community support is defined as a \u201cweighted majority of 60% of the members of the legislative assembly present and voting, including at least 40% of each of the nationalist and unionist designations\u201d. If the vote is negative, then the regulatory uncoupling will not happen for a further two years: 1 January 2027. During this two-year period the EU will work out how to protect the single market, ie another backstop. The cross-party consent mechanism only identifies two categories of party \u2013 \u201cunionist\u201d and \u201cnationalist\u201d \u2013 but assembly members must register in one of three, the third being \u201cother\u201d. The Alliance party headed by Naomi Long is in the \u201cother\u201d category and in future assemblies the number of \u201cother\u201d parties may grow, so this may attract criticism. Checks on border, ports and airports Under the deal, the UK and the EU are \u201cunderlining their firm commitment to no customs and regulatory checks or controls and related physical infrastructure at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland\u201d. They also share the aim of \u201cavoiding controls at the ports and airports of Northern Ireland\u201d. However, in highlighting the agreement not to have checks at the border, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said in his post-deal briefing that \u201call applicable procedures on goods will take place at the points of entry into Northern Ireland and not across the island\u201d. This suggests the long-term aim will indeed be an online system for customs declarations or physical spot checks on goods for EU standards. Future trade deals The EU and the UK will aim for a zero-tariff deal with unlimited quotas. The entire UK, including Northern Ireland, will be free to sign trade deals. The line in the political declaration that \u201cthe United Kingdom will consider aligning with union rules in relevant areas\u201d in any future trade talks has been ditched. One source said the removal of this albeit vague promise of being aligned to the EU in future has been the key to unlocking the support of the European Research Group. Customs Northern Ireland will remain legally in the UK customs territory but practically in the EU customs unions. There will therefore be no customs checks on the border but tariffs will be payable on certain commercial goods. No customs duties will be payable on \u201cpersonal property\u201d being transited from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. That protects online shopping and all items bought for personal rather than commercial use. Customs duties will be payable on goods imported from the UK for commercial use unless it can be demonstrated that the goods remain in Northern Ireland or are for personal use, as above. A system of rebates will allow importers to be reimbursed. Tariffs will be applied to commercial goods entering from Great Britain to Northern Ireland from third countries unless it can be established that they are for use in Northern Ireland only. UK authorities will do this work on behalf of the EU. If it can be proven that these goods remain in Northern Ireland, the duties will be reimbursed to the importer. The criteria for how to demonstrate that the importing of such goods remain in Northern Ireland and qualify for a duty rebate remains to be worked out. West/east trade The commitment to frictionless trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain is restated. \u201cNothing in the protocol prevents the UK from ensuring unfettered market access for goods moving from Northern Ireland to the rest of the UK\u2019s internal market\u201d. VAT EU law on VAT will apply in Northern Ireland. The EU was concerned that VAT differences could create trade distortion and the damage the credibility of the internal market and won the argument. Single electricity market The island of Ireland is considering a single market for electricity so homes in Northern Ireland can get their energy from a supplier in Northern Ireland or the republic. There were fears this could be disrupted by Brexit. Under the Johnson deal, the provisions of union law remain so nothing will change. Level playing field This guarantees that the UK will remain in line with EU conventions on climate, environment and workers rights in a future trade agreement.",

      "body": "<h2>Jimmy Kimmel</h2> <p>\u201cPresident Trump had a very difficult day today,\u201d said Jimmy Kimmel on Wednesday night. On the thousandth day of his presidency, Donald Trump met with Democrats and had what the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, called a \u201cmeltdown\u201d. \u201cWhich, is it even really a meltdown any more?\u201d Kimmel asked. \u201cTrump didn\u2019t have a meltdown \u2013 he had a Wednesday.</p> <p>\u201cThe White House claims Trump was measured, factual and decisive, not hysterical,\u201d Kimmel continued, pointing to one of the president\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1184597281808498688\">bizarre tweets</a> from the day: a picture of Pelosi standing at a table full of men, captioned: \u201cNervous Nancy\u2019s unhinged meltdown!\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULlQOqxIT_0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ULlQOqxIT_0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cHe really should be writing headlines for the Enquirer instead of running the country,\u201d said Kimmel.</p> <p>The meeting with Pelosi was ostensibly to discuss the Turkish invasion of northern Syria, a military strike against America\u2019s Kurdish allies facilitated by the president when, over his military advisers\u2019 objections, he removed US troops from the region.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/oct/16/jimmy-kimmel-on-democratic-debate-candidates-angrily-agree-with-each-other-for-hours\">Jimmy Kimmel on Democratic debate: candidates 'angrily agree with each other for hours'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cTrump now is stuck because basically he gave the president of Turkey a green light to kill these people we promised to protect,\u201d Kimmel summarized. Republicans are even upset, with some demanding he reverse the decision, \u201cwhich he can\u2019t, because that would mean admitting he was wrong, which he doesn\u2019t do\u201d.</p> <p>In an attempt at damage control, the White House on Wednesday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/16/trump-letter-erdogan-turkey-invasion\">released a letter</a> written by Trump to Trukey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what this was supposed to prove other than he\u2019s crazy,\u201d said Kimmel, quoting the first line: \u201c\u2018Let\u2019s work out a good deal!\u2019 As if he\u2019s running a Honda dealership or something.\u201d</p> <p>Trump sent the letter on 9 October, right before Erdo\u011fan proceeded to cross the Syrian border, \u201cso it was insane and ineffective, which is the art of the deal\u201d, said Kimmel.</p> <h2>Trevor Noah</h2> <p>On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah poked at the hypocrisy of the Trump family\u2019s criticism of nepotism, especially in the case of Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good look that a Ukrainian company hired Hunter Biden just months after Joe Biden became the Obama administration\u2019s pointman on Ukraine, because it looks very much like he got this business because of his father\u2019s position,\u201d Noah began. \u201cAnd I understand why a lot of people would complain about that. What I don\u2019t understand is why these people are complaining about that.\u201d</p> <p>These people would be Trump\u2019s sons Donald Jr and Eric, who have put Hunter Biden on blast at rallies and on Fox News, saying they had to give up overseas business for their father\u2019s candidacy. \u201cDo you see me on any boards?\u201d Eric Trump asked Fox News.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1184639161334190080\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Hold up, so the Trump boys wanted to attack the Bidens and the issue they chose was nepotism??? <a href=\"https://t.co/2fP8i68HyI\">pic.twitter.com/2fP8i68HyI</a></p>&mdash; The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1184639161334190080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 17, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>\u201cOK, first of all, I\u2019m not surprised nobody has put Beavis and Forehead on any corporate boards,\u201d Noah responded. \u201cSecondly, if there was ever an example of people who got opportunities because of their names, it\u2019s these two.\u201d For example, Donald Trump Jr was recently paid $50,000 to give a speech at a college. \u201cIf he wasn\u2019t Donald Trump\u2019s son, why else would they be asking him to speak?\u201d Noah asked. \u201cTo share his expertise on bad beards?\u201d</p> <p>Besides, the Trump children have continued to build their businesses overseas in places such as India, Indonesia, Uruguay and the Philippines. \u201cIt\u2019s like the Amazing Race with no running and no chins,\u201d joked Noah.</p> <p>Still, at least Trump\u2019s sons are one step removed from the presidency, said Noah, \u201cbecause there are other Trump children who are in business and government\u201d. That would be his daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, who work in the White House while maintaining overseas business interests; a dozen Ivanka Trump products just received copyright approval by the Chinese government.</p> <p>\u201cOK, come on, China approved a dozen trademarks for Ivanka right as her dad was negotiating trade deals with China? You can\u2019t tell me that\u2019s not suspicious timing,\u201d said Noah. \u201cI mean that\u2019s like how right before Christmas, my mom said that a horrible accident happened at Santa\u2019s factory. How does this happen every year, Mom?\u201d</p> <p>To be clear, Noah concluded, \u201cI\u2019m not defending Hunter Biden. I don\u2019t know him, I don\u2019t know about his business. All I\u2019m saying is that the last people who should be talking about the blurred lines of family names and political influence are the people who are currently running their home office from the White House.\u201d<br></p>",

On the thousandth day of his presidency, Donald Trump met with Democrats and had what the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, called a \u201cmeltdown\u201d. \u201cWhich, is it even really a meltdown any more?\u201d Kimmel asked. \u201cTrump didn\u2019t have a meltdown \u2013 he had a Wednesday. \u201cThe White House claims Trump was measured, factual and decisive, not hysterical,\u201d Kimmel continued, pointing to one of the president\u2019s bizarre tweets from the day: a picture of Pelosi standing at a table full of men, captioned: \u201cNervous Nancy\u2019s unhinged meltdown!\u201d \u201cHe really should be writing headlines for the Enquirer instead of running the country,\u201d said Kimmel. The meeting with Pelosi was ostensibly to discuss the Turkish invasion of northern Syria, a military strike against America\u2019s Kurdish allies facilitated by the president when, over his military advisers\u2019 objections, he removed US troops from the region. \u201cTrump now is stuck because basically he gave the president of Turkey a green light to kill these people we promised to protect,\u201d Kimmel summarized. Republicans are even upset, with some demanding he reverse the decision, \u201cwhich he can\u2019t, because that would mean admitting he was wrong, which he doesn\u2019t do\u201d. In an attempt at damage control, the White House on Wednesday released a letter written by Trump to Trukey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what this was supposed to prove other than he\u2019s crazy,\u201d said Kimmel, quoting the first line: \u201c\u2018Let\u2019s work out a good deal!\u2019 As if he\u2019s running a Honda dealership or something.\u201d Trump sent the letter on 9 October, right before Erdo\u011fan proceeded to cross the Syrian border, \u201cso it was insane and ineffective, which is the art of the deal\u201d, said Kimmel. Trevor Noah On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah poked at the hypocrisy of the Trump family\u2019s criticism of nepotism, especially in the case of Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good look that a Ukrainian company hired Hunter Biden just months after Joe Biden became the Obama administration\u2019s pointman on Ukraine, because it looks very much like he got this business because of his father\u2019s position,\u201d Noah began. \u201cAnd I understand why a lot of people would complain about that. What I don\u2019t understand is why these people are complaining about that.\u201d These people would be Trump\u2019s sons Donald Jr and Eric, who have put Hunter Biden on blast at rallies and on Fox News, saying they had to give up overseas business for their father\u2019s candidacy. \u201cDo you see me on any boards?\u201d Eric Trump asked Fox News. \u201cOK, first of all, I\u2019m not surprised nobody has put Beavis and Forehead on any corporate boards,\u201d Noah responded. \u201cSecondly, if there was ever an example of people who got opportunities because of their names, it\u2019s these two.\u201d For example, Donald Trump Jr was recently paid $50,000 to give a speech at a college. \u201cIf he wasn\u2019t Donald Trump\u2019s son, why else would they be asking him to speak?\u201d Noah asked. \u201cTo share his expertise on bad beards?\u201d Besides, the Trump children have continued to build their businesses overseas in places such as India, Indonesia, Uruguay and the Philippines. \u201cIt\u2019s like the Amazing Race with no running and no chins,\u201d joked Noah. Still, at least Trump\u2019s sons are one step removed from the presidency, said Noah, \u201cbecause there are other Trump children who are in business and government\u201d. That would be his daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, who work in the White House while maintaining overseas business interests; a dozen Ivanka Trump products just received copyright approval by the Chinese government. \u201cOK, come on, China approved a dozen trademarks for Ivanka right as her dad was negotiating trade deals with China? You can\u2019t tell me that\u2019s not suspicious timing,\u201d said Noah. \u201cI mean that\u2019s like how right before Christmas, my mom said that a horrible accident happened at Santa\u2019s factory. How does this happen every year, Mom?\u201d To be clear, Noah concluded, \u201cI\u2019m not defending Hunter Biden. I don\u2019t know him, I don\u2019t know about his business. All I\u2019m saying is that the last people who should be talking about the blurred lines of family names and political influence are the people who are currently running their home office from the White House.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The United States is becoming a less Christian country, and the decline in religious affiliation is particularly rapid among younger Americans, new figures show. The proportion of US adults who describe themselves as Christian has fallen to two-thirds, a drop of 12 percentage points over the past decade, according to data from the Pew Research Center. Over the same period, the proportion of those describing themselves as atheist, agnostic or \u201cnothing in particular\u201d has risen by 17 percentage points to more than a quarter of the adult population. Although churches and faith movements continue to exert strong political influence on the Trump administration and at the state level, the proportion of American adults attending religious services has declined. The proportion of US adults who are white born-again or evangelical Protestants \u2013 the religious group which strives hardest to see its political agenda adopted \u2013 is now 16%, down from 19% a decade ago. The number going to church at least once or twice a month has fallen by seven percentage points over the past decade. More Americans now say they attend religious services a few times a year or less (54%) than say they attend at least monthly (45%). The fall in religious identification and activity has affected both Protestant and Roman Catholic churches. According to Pew, 43% of adults identify with Protestantism, down from 51% in 2009. And 20% are Catholic, down from 23% in 2009. Fewer than half of millennials (49%) describe themselves as Christians; four in 10 are religious \u201cnones\u201d, and 9% identify with non-Christian faiths. As many millennials say they never attend religious services (22%) as those who say they go at least once a week. Pew\u2019s report, released on Thursday, says the decline of Christian communities is continuing at a rapid pace. \u201cReligious \u2018nones\u2019 have grown across multiple demographic groups: white people, black people and Hispanics; men and women; all regions of the country; and among college graduates and those with lower levels of educational attainment. \u201cReligious \u2018nones\u2019 are growing faster among Democrats than Republicans, though their ranks are swelling in both partisan coalitions. And although the religiously unaffiliated are on the rise among younger people and most groups of older adults, their growth is most pronounced among young adults,\u201d the report said. The share of US adults who identify with non-Christian faiths has increased from 5% in 2009 to 7% in 2019. Two percent of Americans are Jewish, 1% are Muslim, 1% are Buddhist, 1% are Hindu, and 3% who identify with other faiths, including people who say they abide by their own personal religious beliefs and people who describe themselves as \u201cspiritual\u201d.

For while a certain faded newspaper executive\u2019s office is physically located in the Associated building on London\u2019s High Street Kensington, I\u2019m afraid that, in spiritual terms, this individual resides on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2003/mar/14/artsfeatures2\" title=\"\">Sunset Boulevard</a>. And some shots have been fired.</p> <p>But who is this descending the staircase, wild-eyed and writing excruciatingly humiliating letters to the Financial Times?

You know, before everyone pivoted to video. Then pivoted back again, having made somewhat less of a success of it than Hollywood did with the talkies.</p> <p>Anyway, let us bring up the lights and hear what the former Daily Mail editor is saying as he emotes furiously down the stairs of his dreamworld: \u201cYou see, this is my life! It always will be! Just us, the printing presses, and all those wonderful readers out there in the dark. All right, Lord Rothermere \u2013 I\u2019m ready for my closeup.\u201d Wonderful.

Let\u2019s widen our shot from the corpse \u2013 perhaps my own, after writing this \u2013 and go back in time a bit.

The report concludes: \u201cThe new twist in the dispute between Dacre and Greig will put pressure on [Mail proprietor] Rothermere to resolve the issue of Dacre\u2019s status.

      "bodyText": "To the executive offices of Associated Newspapers, publishers of the Daily Mail, and a story that you sense will end with a screenwriter floating dead in a swimming pool. For while a certain faded newspaper executive\u2019s office is physically located in the Associated building on London\u2019s High Street Kensington, I\u2019m afraid that, in spiritual terms, this individual resides on Sunset Boulevard. And some shots have been fired. But who is this descending the staircase, wild-eyed and writing excruciatingly humiliating letters to the Financial Times? Why, I believe \u2013 yes, it looks like Paul Dacre, forgotten star of the silent newspaper era. You know, before everyone pivoted to video. Then pivoted back again, having made somewhat less of a success of it than Hollywood did with the talkies. Anyway, let us bring up the lights and hear what the former Daily Mail editor is saying as he emotes furiously down the stairs of his dreamworld: \u201cYou see, this is my life! It always will be! Just us, the printing presses, and all those wonderful readers out there in the dark. All right, Lord Rothermere \u2013 I\u2019m ready for my closeup.\u201d Wonderful. Tragic, camp, hilarious \u2013 of course. But wonderful. Legends don\u2019t die; they just stew in the C-suite. But forgive me, for I\u2019m getting ahead of myself. Let\u2019s widen our shot from the corpse \u2013 perhaps my own, after writing this \u2013 and go back in time a bit. Last Saturday\u2019s Financial Times featured a letter written to the paper by Dacre, and it was impossible to behold this document for even a moment without the words reassembling themselves into Norma Desmond\u2019s famous speech.

Alas, the suggestion that he was commercially dislikable \u2013 the only kind of dislike that matters \u2013 was rather too much for our silent star.

      "body": "<p>\u201cYour holiday will ideally start before you reach the snow,\u201d says Stuart Fleming, who came to the Andorran resort of Soldeu 20 years ago on a career break and subsequently made it his home. \u201cAddressing your fitness levels before you start skiing will help you ride longer and enjoy your holiday more. It\u2019s not about getting super fit \u2013 just taking the stairs rather than the lift in the weeks leading up to your break will work wonders. Walking downstairs is the perfect pre-ski exercise!\u201d</p> <p>Pre-trip training is something Simon Cook also advises. \u201cSpending a few hours at an indoor snow centre before your trip is essential for all occasional skiers, and beginners in particular,\u201d he says. \u201cIt means you can get used to walking in your boots and crack the basics of turning and stopping in a safe environment and ultimately get better value out of your time on holiday.\u201d</p> <p>Well accustomed to the ebb and flow of guests to their resorts, Fleming and Cook have some handy tips for those who can\u2019t avoid travelling during peak times. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to be attracted to big-name resorts but lesser-known destinations, like Soldeu, are much quieter during school holidays, meaning you won\u2019t waste precious time in lift queues,\u201d says Fleming. \u201cAlso, because Spanish and Catalan guests typically eat lunch quite late, you can enjoy a peaceful lunch around midday before lapping up deserted pistes for a couple of hours.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e0909277be81d1c9a013ad953a1e7fcaf2e6bb4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e0909277be81d1c9a013ad953a1e7fcaf2e6bb4/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Drive 1 Landscape.Ski coaching\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lesser-known resorts are much quieter during peak times such as school holidays</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Bader/Neilson Ski</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"6765862ebe2ffceebd6a0563ce0a5e76e92dd69e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6765862ebe2ffceebd6a0563ce0a5e76e92dd69e/14_164_2192_2738/801.jpg\" alt=\"NEW\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grandvalira, with its iconic \u2018X\u2019 pistes</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Lara/Neilson Ski</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"b6e2b3851ecb532f1d5911dd5b5e4083e1c8d0f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6e2b3851ecb532f1d5911dd5b5e4083e1c8d0f3/1380_0_3072_3840/800.jpg\" alt=\"boots\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simon Cook: \u2018Spending a few hours at an indoor snow centre ... means you can get used to your boots\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Bader/Neilson Ski</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Andorran villages like Grandvalira, with its iconic \u2018X\u2019 pistes, are true hidden gems</p></li> </ul> <p>Cook urges people hoping to enjoy some ski lessons to book well ahead if heading to the Alps during peak periods. \u201cGuests who have enjoyed my complimentary Neilson Mountain Expert guiding and coaching sessions often want to book further private lessons, but are disappointed when they discover the ski school is already booked up,\u201d he says. \u201cYou really do have to book early to secure your lessons.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps because they\u2019ve offered to carry their clients\u2019 skis home one too many times, both experts suggest finding accommodation that\u2019s as close as possible to the pistes. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how long you\u2019ve been skiing or snowboarding,\u201d says Cook, \u201cdragging your kit around is always annoying so finding a hotel or chalet close to the lifts, or even near a bus stop that will take you there is a gamechanger.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ebcea8cad4fa2c58f6a671af3a85c5e68223c213\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ebcea8cad4fa2c58f6a671af3a85c5e68223c213/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Showcase- Neilson Mountain Experts guiding and coaching service\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A day or two riding with a local can make a world of difference to your holiday</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Bader/Neilson Ski</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During the first couple of days of a ski holiday, it can be hard enough remembering how to ski, let alone figuring out the lay of the pistes, particularly if you\u2019re visiting a resort for the first time.

      "bodyText": "\u201cYour holiday will ideally start before you reach the snow,\u201d says Stuart Fleming, who came to the Andorran resort of Soldeu 20 years ago on a career break and subsequently made it his home. \u201cAddressing your fitness levels before you start skiing will help you ride longer and enjoy your holiday more. It\u2019s not about getting super fit \u2013 just taking the stairs rather than the lift in the weeks leading up to your break will work wonders. Walking downstairs is the perfect pre-ski exercise!\u201d Pre-trip training is something Simon Cook also advises. \u201cSpending a few hours at an indoor snow centre before your trip is essential for all occasional skiers, and beginners in particular,\u201d he says. \u201cIt means you can get used to walking in your boots and crack the basics of turning and stopping in a safe environment and ultimately get better value out of your time on holiday.\u201d Well accustomed to the ebb and flow of guests to their resorts, Fleming and Cook have some handy tips for those who can\u2019t avoid travelling during peak times. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to be attracted to big-name resorts but lesser-known destinations, like Soldeu, are much quieter during school holidays, meaning you won\u2019t waste precious time in lift queues,\u201d says Fleming. \u201cAlso, because Spanish and Catalan guests typically eat lunch quite late, you can enjoy a peaceful lunch around midday before lapping up deserted pistes for a couple of hours.\u201d Andorran villages like Grandvalira, with its iconic \u2018X\u2019 pistes, are true hidden gems Cook urges people hoping to enjoy some ski lessons to book well ahead if heading to the Alps during peak periods. \u201cGuests who have enjoyed my complimentary Neilson Mountain Expert guiding and coaching sessions often want to book further private lessons, but are disappointed when they discover the ski school is already booked up,\u201d he says. \u201cYou really do have to book early to secure your lessons.\u201d Perhaps because they\u2019ve offered to carry their clients\u2019 skis home one too many times, both experts suggest finding accommodation that\u2019s as close as possible to the pistes. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how long you\u2019ve been skiing or snowboarding,\u201d says Cook, \u201cdragging your kit around is always annoying so finding a hotel or chalet close to the lifts, or even near a bus stop that will take you there is a gamechanger.\u201d During the first couple of days of a ski holiday, it can be hard enough remembering how to ski, let alone figuring out the lay of the pistes, particularly if you\u2019re visiting a resort for the first time. A day or two riding with a local, gleaning tips on the best cruiser blues and secret off-piste stashes, will make a world of difference to your enjoyment of the entire week. As Fleming explains, this is where Neilson Mountain Collection guests can capitalise on the guiding sessions included in their holiday: \u201cThese informal group sessions are well worth the investment of your time \u2013 you can brush up on your skills, provide a point of focus in a fun, relaxed environment and build a great sense of camaraderie.

It\u2019s a lovely big Georgian building with a great history of poetry readings and live music, both of which first attracted me to the place. When I was in school, several of my teachers and local writers hung out there, and a number of respected writers came to share their work, and read from it.

      "bodyText": "The thing I love most about Limerick is \u2026 It\u2019s absolutely full of life. The more I go home, the more I see new things in the city. Music lovers should head to ... Live music is very strong in the city and the most well-known venues are Dolan\u2019s and the Kasbah. The Kasbah is where newer Limerick bands gig \u2013 artists such as PowPig, for example. It\u2019s important to have venues where younger bands feel comfortable and are able to develop at their own pace. Growing up, Costello\u2019s Tavern was like our private Ha\u00e7ienda, the only place that, at the time, you could hear music such as Patti Smith, Suede, anything and everything. It was one of the most important places ever for me and my friends, and that hasn\u2019t really changed. The owner, Flan, always welcomes us back \u2013 \u201cAh, there\u2019s my lovely crowd!\u201d \u2013 so going there is a must. Music lovers should also check out Steamboat Records, which has a good selection of music as well as records by local bands. All Tvvins band in soundcheck at Dolan\u2019s in Limerick Art lovers should head to \u2026 The Hunt Museum, which has an amazing collection of artefacts and paintings \u2013 even a Picasso and a Renoir \u2013 as well as many by Irish artists. I\u2019d also recommend Limerick City Gallery of Art, which supports local and emerging artists. Stock up on books at \u2026 O\u2019Mahony\u2019s. I was in there recently, and a staff member went way beyond the call of duty to help. It made such a difference. That\u2019s the reason why I like buying books, and music, in an actual shop. Keeping independent shops in the city centre is so important. Displays and details at the Hunt Museum My go-to coffee shop is \u2026 The Hook and Ladder cafe on Corbally Road. There are three Hook and Ladder cafes in the city but this is my favourite. I\u2019ll stay in my own corner here for hours on end, with my books and notepads, without being disturbed. I also like Mortell\u2019s Deli &amp; Restaurant, which is so traditional they still have handwritten receipts. O\u2019Connor\u2019s Restaurant is similar to Bewley\u2019s in Dublin. I had a week off work last year and I just spent all of it in O\u2019Connor\u2019s writing. Grab a bite to eat at \u2026 My favourite restaurant, Cornstore \u2013 it has a really good vegetarian offering and is a great place to go if you have different dietary requirements. Alternatively, the Milk Market is kind of the new hub in the city. It\u2019s a massive fusion of local fare and artisanal producers. You can get any kind of food you want there, really and it\u2019s great for people-watching, from students and art college people to anyone coming in for a browse. Go on Saturday mornings. Cornstore restaurant and Milk Market food fair Fancy a pint? Stop by at Limerick\u2019s oldest bar, the White House. It\u2019s a lovely big Georgian building with a great history of poetry readings and live music, both of which first attracted me to the place. When I was in school, several of my teachers and local writers hung out there, and a number of respected writers came to share their work, and read from it. Although that\u2019s no longer the scene, the building has certainly retained an atmosphere of creativity and activity. For me, the place stands out as one of the pubs with the strongest identity in Limerick. The rich, cosy interior is the perfect place to spend a winter evening. Number 1 Pery Square and the River Shannon I love to unwind by \u2026 A beautiful walk along the river. There are real natural sanctuary areas with herons and birdlife. It takes you into Limerick city, which is where I always end up. When I\u2019m home, I\u2019m usually in need of recharging, so if I can I will try to fit in a spa treatment at the beautiful boutique hotel, Number 1 Pery Square.

They hold all the B shares, which are not listed on the stock exchange but do accrue dividend payments and have 10 times the voting rights of the A shares. Ultimately the Glazers\u2019 route to a fabulously profitable sale is to convert the B shares into A, which are publicly traded and bought by investors such as the banks whose executives hold those awkward public investor calls with Woodward every quarter.</p> <p>United\u2019s annual report notes that a company registered overseas does not have to follow the standard corporate governance standards of the New York stock exchange.</p> <p>\u201cAccordingly, we follow certain corporate governance practices of our home country, the Cayman Islands,\u201d the report states. \u201cSpecifically, we do not have a board of directors composed of a majority of independent directors, or a remuneration committee \u2026 composed entirely of independent directors.\u201d</p> <p>The purpose of independent, or non-executive, directors is to apply objective scrutiny of how a company is being run and hold its executives to account. United\u2019s board includes Woodward, Richard Arnold, the well-regarded group managing director, the chief financial officer Cliff Baty, three independents, Kassewitz and all five of her brothers. Joel and Avi are acknowledged to be the only two of the Glazers involved in the day\u2011to\u2011day running of the club. They, with one of the independents, Robert Leit\u00e3o of the bankers Rothschild, sit on the remuneration committee which decides the pay of the directors. The total paid to the board and executive management in 2018-19 was \u00a310.7m, which the accounts do not break down individually. Woodward is paid by a subsidiary company, Manchester United Football Club Ltd; his salary in 2017-18, the most recently published, was \u00a34.152m.</p> <p>The Glazers have made more than \u00a3200m selling slices of their shareholdings to investors, and one day, surely, the persistent speculation about a sale will culminate in them cashing out, perhaps as suddenly as they bought United, largely unwelcomed, in 2005.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Defenders of the ownership point to the reality that the debts and payments to the Glazers are not a looming burden any more, as they were in the early years when Ferguson\u2019s fire carried them through. Under the Glazers and Woodward, United are a commercial behemoth, their latest multi\u2011sponsor record revenues \u00a3627m, although that will drop this season because of their absence from the Champions League. The debt remains vast, \u00a3511m, and costs \u00a325m in interest, but United can wave that away, and the \u00a323m dividends, without really feeling it. The club points to an average annual net spend on players of more than \u00a3100m over the past seven years, more than any other club except their Abu Dhabi-funded noisy neighbours.</p> <p>Yet City\u2019s Barcelona-modelled structures mean they have spent their money rather more effectively and, like Liverpool, have comprehensively eclipsed United. The signing of so many players for so little reward at United prompts questions rather than answers, about the culture at the club whose owners have taken such fortunes out since their hostile takeover 14 years ago.</p>",

They hold all the B shares, which are not listed on the stock exchange but do accrue dividend payments and have 10 times the voting rights of the A shares. Ultimately the Glazers\u2019 route to a fabulously profitable sale is to convert the B shares into A, which are publicly traded and bought by investors such as the banks whose executives hold those awkward public investor calls with Woodward every quarter. United\u2019s annual report notes that a company registered overseas does not have to follow the standard corporate governance standards of the New York stock exchange. \u201cAccordingly, we follow certain corporate governance practices of our home country, the Cayman Islands,\u201d the report states. \u201cSpecifically, we do not have a board of directors composed of a majority of independent directors, or a remuneration committee \u2026 composed entirely of independent directors.\u201d The purpose of independent, or non-executive, directors is to apply objective scrutiny of how a company is being run and hold its executives to account. United\u2019s board includes Woodward, Richard Arnold, the well-regarded group managing director, the chief financial officer Cliff Baty, three independents, Kassewitz and all five of her brothers. Joel and Avi are acknowledged to be the only two of the Glazers involved in the day\u2011to\u2011day running of the club. They, with one of the independents, Robert Leit\u00e3o of the bankers Rothschild, sit on the remuneration committee which decides the pay of the directors. The total paid to the board and executive management in 2018-19 was \u00a310.7m, which the accounts do not break down individually. Woodward is paid by a subsidiary company, Manchester United Football Club Ltd; his salary in 2017-18, the most recently published, was \u00a34.152m. The Glazers have made more than \u00a3200m selling slices of their shareholdings to investors, and one day, surely, the persistent speculation about a sale will culminate in them cashing out, perhaps as suddenly as they bought United, largely unwelcomed, in 2005. Defenders of the ownership point to the reality that the debts and payments to the Glazers are not a looming burden any more, as they were in the early years when Ferguson\u2019s fire carried them through. Under the Glazers and Woodward, United are a commercial behemoth, their latest multi\u2011sponsor record revenues \u00a3627m, although that will drop this season because of their absence from the Champions League. The debt remains vast, \u00a3511m, and costs \u00a325m in interest, but United can wave that away, and the \u00a323m dividends, without really feeling it. The club points to an average annual net spend on players of more than \u00a3100m over the past seven years, more than any other club except their Abu Dhabi-funded noisy neighbours. Yet City\u2019s Barcelona-modelled structures mean they have spent their money rather more effectively and, like Liverpool, have comprehensively eclipsed United. The signing of so many players for so little reward at United prompts questions rather than answers, about the culture at the club whose owners have taken such fortunes out since their hostile takeover 14 years ago.",

      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/carolineplz\" title=\"\">Caroline Polachek</a> was writing about the danger of trying to change for somebody from her first hit with indie-pop group Chairlift. \u201cI tried to do handstands for you,\u201d she sang on 2008\u2019s twee yet melancholy <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8HRCacAQ-4\" title=\"\">Bruises</a>, which made the Boulder-to-Brooklyn transplants ubiquitous after it was used in an iPod advert. The charming track caught the trio in a similar bind with their audience. \u201cEven when we released our second album, which was much grittier than the first, people pushed back and said: \u2018We want more Bruises,\u2019\u201d Polachek recalls.</p> <p>To their credit, Chairlift never caved in. Over three albums, the trio-turned-duo easily outstripped the fast-diminishing Brooklyn indie scene of the early 2010s. She and Patrick Wimberley were as fluent in 80s Japanese pop, esoteric English songwriter <a href=\"http://www.virginiaastley.com/\" title=\"\">Virginia Astley</a> and opera as they were contemporary R&amp;B. They split, amicably, in 2017, proud of their distinctive sound, says Polachek, if disheartened by the limited perceptions of what an indie band could become.</p> <p>Polachek had released a pop album as <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19287-ramona-lisa-arcadia/\" title=\"\">Ramona Lisa</a> in between Chairlift\u2019s second and third albums; Beyonc\u00e9 ended up recording a Ramona Lisa castoff, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7PPjEB2QZQ\" title=\"\">No Angel</a>, on her self-titled fifth album. An ambient record, billed to <a href=\"https://cepdrawingthetarget.bandcamp.com/\" title=\"\">CEP</a>, followed Chairlift\u2019s split. The shifting names, she says, offered conceptual limitations that guided her work. Pang, her first album under her own name, arrives free from such scaffolding \u2013 so much so that it was never supposed to exist. Thankfully, it does: it\u2019s among the year\u2019s finest experimental pop albums, blending acoustic and synthetic textures into a surrealist yet affecting listen. Co-producers Polachek and PC Music alumnus <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/dannylharle\" title=\"\">Danny L Harle</a> wield elegance and precision worthy of a sushi master, or peak-pop Peter Gabriel.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn3cHUtNZKo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sn3cHUtNZKo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>After Chairlift split, Polachek felt her life lacked structure. \u201cI figured I would just try a bit of everything,\u201d she says over lunch in Paris last month. She\u2019s here for fashion week and her outfit suggests someone at home there: a leather vest over a blousy white shirt that makes Polachek, with her striking, almond-shaped face and wide eyes, look like a modish Joan of Arc, whereas I would look like an employee at a medieval-themed restaurant. In summer 2017, she was in LA to write songs with Harle, the idea being to pitch them to Katy Perry. A magic-mushroom trip made her second-guess her plans. \u201cI remember thinking: what I do with my time right now is really going to determine what happens next,\u201d she recalls in her cut-glass accent. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be wasting my time on things that I don\u2019t care passionately about.\u201d</p> <p>When she called Harle to cancel, he suggested they write for her instead. Polachek had been making a \u201cwarmer, auburn, folk-tinged, peaceful\u201d album titled Calico that she didn\u2019t see working with the hard, shiny, electronic sound Harle was known for. Still, she agreed. Perhaps inevitably, they came up with something that overshadowed Calico and kickstarted a fruitful collaboration. Their first song, Parachute, \u201cis about a total loss of control,\u201d says Polachek. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not giving that control up to another person, it\u2019s giving it up to life \u2013 and that\u2019s the scariest thing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8ce199d4d760d4652f6550ccf60feac790bd8688\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ce199d4d760d4652f6550ccf60feac790bd8688/0_0_6175_4117/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Caroline Polachek.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Like a peak-pop Peter Gabriel ... Caroline Polachek.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nedda Asfari</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It turned out to be premonitory. Polachek had been experiencing inexplicable adrenal rushes that stopped her from sleeping and accelerated her metabolism. She called them \u201cpangs\u201d and sought to recreate the sensation in her sessions with Harle. \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell if my excitement about all these musical breakthroughs was triggering my body,\u201d she says, \u201clike I was manufacturing drugs internally.\u201d Six months later, her marriage of two years ended. \u201cAll these structures that had seemed essential to my identity and my time fell away,\u201d she says. \u201cEverything happened very fast. I felt a giant shift within myself that caught me by surprise. As much as I fought against it, I had to learn that the body knows more than we do.\u201d</p> <p>Polachek had felt rooted in New York in her relationship. Then she experienced \u201cwhat Joni Mitchell calls <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/aug/15/joni-mitchells-albums-ranked\" title=\"\">the hejira</a>, this need to fly to another place,\u201d she says. \u201cA lot of the music comes out of that conflict of wanting this other thing and feeling guilty about wanting it, and then it guiding me somewhere despite my kicking and screaming.\u201d She is opaque about the relationship \u201cout of respect for privacy\u201d, she says carefully, welling up a bit. Following those impulses entailed \u201ca digestion of shame and self-questioning that, nonetheless, led to a resolution that things would be OK\u201d. She felt she was running towards something rather than away from it, although she admits she felt burdened by \u201ca crystallised idea of what the world was\u201d in New York \u2013 even though the Brooklyn heyday was over, she still saw the same faces on the street every day. \u201cI felt like it was a weight that was always on whatever I did.\u201d</p> <p>She is more cutting in her lyrics, which repeatedly touch on being asked to change her nature. \u201cWhen I stop caring, you stop caring,\u201d she sings on I Give Up, which crests on a frustrated heave of a chorus. (Polachek describes her music brilliantly: \u201cThe whole song is an expression of apathy, and I wanted it to feel like something was being chucked really hard.\u201d) She had never written that plainly before, though it came easily. \u201cChairlift felt like a comfort blanket because Patrick and I were like brother and sister,\u201d she explains. \u201cBut it subconsciously imposed a platonic neutrality over everything we did, which stopped me from approaching things with a certain emotional intensity. I wanted to make sure he felt like he could get behind everything.\u201d</p> <p>Polachek has found transitioning into a solo career easier than expected, it bringing new fans who hadn\u2019t followed Chairlift. \u201cI felt the perception of what I was doing as \u2018indie\u2019 was going to travel with me, but it hasn\u2019t at all, which is really exciting,\u201d she says. Aged 34 and with 12 years in a band behind her, she had worried about being a late starter, a notion she made herself reject. \u201cI\u2019m just beginning,\u201d she says. \u201cI think women are taught in the music industry that once you\u2019re 35, you\u2019ve expired, and I\u2019m here to prove that factually incorrect.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There\u2019s just so much more public female intellect on display now than there ever has been</p> <footer> <cite>Caroline Polachek</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The week we meet, Polachek tweets that her new album had marked the first time that journalists asked about her vision, not her appearance. \u201cThere\u2019s just so much more public female intellect on display now than there ever has been,\u201d she says when I ask why that might be. \u201cYoung people have realised that an artist is in charge of what they\u2019re doing \u2013 this crazy cynicism that artists were puppets has disappeared. They have [music production software] Ableton Live and know how hard it is to write a song.\u201d</p> <p>If Polachek clings to any vestiges of the late-00s Brooklyn scene, it\u2019s that DIY mindset: she directs her videos and recently started her own imprint within Sony, Perpetual Novice. \u201cI do way more of my own stuff than I should be at this point,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m so obsessed with doing it myself.\u201d Although in person her thoughtful answers and clarity evince academic-level focus, she describes herself as \u201ceasily distractible\u201d, always divided between four different endeavours; even this short stay in Paris has produced a possible new musical collaboration. Not only does Polachek not want to know what other people think she should be doing, she doesn\u2019t want to preordain it herself. \u201cI want to keep different options for different futures open all the time.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Caroline Polachek was writing about the danger of trying to change for somebody from her first hit with indie-pop group Chairlift. \u201cI tried to do handstands for you,\u201d she sang on 2008\u2019s twee yet melancholy Bruises, which made the Boulder-to-Brooklyn transplants ubiquitous after it was used in an iPod advert. The charming track caught the trio in a similar bind with their audience. \u201cEven when we released our second album, which was much grittier than the first, people pushed back and said: \u2018We want more Bruises,\u2019\u201d Polachek recalls. To their credit, Chairlift never caved in. Over three albums, the trio-turned-duo easily outstripped the fast-diminishing Brooklyn indie scene of the early 2010s. She and Patrick Wimberley were as fluent in 80s Japanese pop, esoteric English songwriter Virginia Astley and opera as they were contemporary R&amp;B. They split, amicably, in 2017, proud of their distinctive sound, says Polachek, if disheartened by the limited perceptions of what an indie band could become. Polachek had released a pop album as Ramona Lisa in between Chairlift\u2019s second and third albums; Beyonc\u00e9 ended up recording a Ramona Lisa castoff, No Angel, on her self-titled fifth album. An ambient record, billed to CEP, followed Chairlift\u2019s split. The shifting names, she says, offered conceptual limitations that guided her work. Pang, her first album under her own name, arrives free from such scaffolding \u2013 so much so that it was never supposed to exist. Thankfully, it does: it\u2019s among the year\u2019s finest experimental pop albums, blending acoustic and synthetic textures into a surrealist yet affecting listen. Co-producers Polachek and PC Music alumnus Danny L Harle wield elegance and precision worthy of a sushi master, or peak-pop Peter Gabriel. After Chairlift split, Polachek felt her life lacked structure. \u201cI figured I would just try a bit of everything,\u201d she says over lunch in Paris last month. She\u2019s here for fashion week and her outfit suggests someone at home there: a leather vest over a blousy white shirt that makes Polachek, with her striking, almond-shaped face and wide eyes, look like a modish Joan of Arc, whereas I would look like an employee at a medieval-themed restaurant. In summer 2017, she was in LA to write songs with Harle, the idea being to pitch them to Katy Perry. A magic-mushroom trip made her second-guess her plans. \u201cI remember thinking: what I do with my time right now is really going to determine what happens next,\u201d she recalls in her cut-glass accent. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be wasting my time on things that I don\u2019t care passionately about.\u201d When she called Harle to cancel, he suggested they write for her instead. Polachek had been making a \u201cwarmer, auburn, folk-tinged, peaceful\u201d album titled Calico that she didn\u2019t see working with the hard, shiny, electronic sound Harle was known for. Still, she agreed. Perhaps inevitably, they came up with something that overshadowed Calico and kickstarted a fruitful collaboration. Their first song, Parachute, \u201cis about a total loss of control,\u201d says Polachek. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not giving that control up to another person, it\u2019s giving it up to life \u2013 and that\u2019s the scariest thing.\u201d It turned out to be premonitory. Polachek had been experiencing inexplicable adrenal rushes that stopped her from sleeping and accelerated her metabolism. She called them \u201cpangs\u201d and sought to recreate the sensation in her sessions with Harle. \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell if my excitement about all these musical breakthroughs was triggering my body,\u201d she says, \u201clike I was manufacturing drugs internally.\u201d Six months later, her marriage of two years ended. \u201cAll these structures that had seemed essential to my identity and my time fell away,\u201d she says. \u201cEverything happened very fast. I felt a giant shift within myself that caught me by surprise. As much as I fought against it, I had to learn that the body knows more than we do.\u201d Polachek had felt rooted in New York in her relationship. Then she experienced \u201cwhat Joni Mitchell calls the hejira, this need to fly to another place,\u201d she says. \u201cA lot of the music comes out of that conflict of wanting this other thing and feeling guilty about wanting it, and then it guiding me somewhere despite my kicking and screaming.\u201d She is opaque about the relationship \u201cout of respect for privacy\u201d, she says carefully, welling up a bit. Following those impulses entailed \u201ca digestion of shame and self-questioning that, nonetheless, led to a resolution that things would be OK\u201d. She felt she was running towards something rather than away from it, although she admits she felt burdened by \u201ca crystallised idea of what the world was\u201d in New York \u2013 even though the Brooklyn heyday was over, she still saw the same faces on the street every day. \u201cI felt like it was a weight that was always on whatever I did.\u201d She is more cutting in her lyrics, which repeatedly touch on being asked to change her nature. \u201cWhen I stop caring, you stop caring,\u201d she sings on I Give Up, which crests on a frustrated heave of a chorus. (Polachek describes her music brilliantly: \u201cThe whole song is an expression of apathy, and I wanted it to feel like something was being chucked really hard.\u201d) She had never written that plainly before, though it came easily. \u201cChairlift felt like a comfort blanket because Patrick and I were like brother and sister,\u201d she explains. \u201cBut it subconsciously imposed a platonic neutrality over everything we did, which stopped me from approaching things with a certain emotional intensity. I wanted to make sure he felt like he could get behind everything.\u201d Polachek has found transitioning into a solo career easier than expected, it bringing new fans who hadn\u2019t followed Chairlift. \u201cI felt the perception of what I was doing as \u2018indie\u2019 was going to travel with me, but it hasn\u2019t at all, which is really exciting,\u201d she says. Aged 34 and with 12 years in a band behind her, she had worried about being a late starter, a notion she made herself reject. \u201cI\u2019m just beginning,\u201d she says. \u201cI think women are taught in the music industry that once you\u2019re 35, you\u2019ve expired, and I\u2019m here to prove that factually incorrect.\u201d The week we meet, Polachek tweets that her new album had marked the first time that journalists asked about her vision, not her appearance. \u201cThere\u2019s just so much more public female intellect on display now than there ever has been,\u201d she says when I ask why that might be. \u201cYoung people have realised that an artist is in charge of what they\u2019re doing \u2013 this crazy cynicism that artists were puppets has disappeared. They have [music production software] Ableton Live and know how hard it is to write a song.\u201d If Polachek clings to any vestiges of the late-00s Brooklyn scene, it\u2019s that DIY mindset: she directs her videos and recently started her own imprint within Sony, Perpetual Novice. \u201cI do way more of my own stuff than I should be at this point,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m so obsessed with doing it myself.\u201d Although in person her thoughtful answers and clarity evince academic-level focus, she describes herself as \u201ceasily distractible\u201d, always divided between four different endeavours; even this short stay in Paris has produced a possible new musical collaboration. Not only does Polachek not want to know what other people think she should be doing, she doesn\u2019t want to preordain it herself. \u201cI want to keep different options for different futures open all the time.\u201d",

As luck would have it, our [REDACTED]-dwelling, [REDACTED]-designing, [REDACTED]-testing North Korean cousin [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] Fiver got in touch to bring us news of a historic and truly emphatic victory for his nation\u2019s team. A mid-ranking government propagandist, [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] Fiver revealed that the Hermit Kingdom had beaten their hated neighbours 34-0 at Pyongyang\u2019s Kim Il-sung Stadium, with one-time Dear Leader Kim Jong-il scoring no fewer than five hat-tricks, despite having passed away almost eight years ago.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, enthused our ridiculously patriotic cousin, despite the blackout, football fans everywhere will be able to witness this glorious triumph just as soon as the North Korean government\u2019s FX department has performed the necessary splicing and dicing of Matt Le Tissier\u2019s YouTube best bits and super-imposed Kim\u2019s face over that of the former Southampton legend for a commemorative DVD.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/17/north-korea-played-like-it-was-waging-war-in-pyongyang-match-says-south\">North Korea played like it was 'waging war' in Pyongyang match, says South</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Having been forced to deny accusations they had tried to poison North Korea\u2019s players <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/16/north-south-korea-world-cup-qualifier\">before a previous encounter</a> between the two countries, who are still technically at war, this time around South Korea claimed they hadn\u2019t been beaten and brazenly boasted they had actually held their opponents <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/17/north-korea-played-like-it-was-waging-war-in-pyongyang-match-says-south\">to a scoreless draw</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s too bad that we didn\u2019t win, but the match was very aggressive to a degree that I think it\u2019s a huge achievement just to return safely without being injured,\u201d captain Son Heung-min told reporters, before heading back to London to prepare for Tottenham\u2019s defeat at the hands of Watford. \u201cNorth Korean players were sensitive and aggressive. There was a lot of severe swearing.\u201d</p> <p>While Son did not specify who exactly it was that was effing and jeffing severely, the smart money suggests his Portuguese manager Paulo Bento was definitely among those turning the air blue. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a good match at all,\u201d he fumed. \u201cWe didn\u2019t execute what we\u2019d prepared.\u201d By contrast, according to [REDACTED] [REDACTED] REDACTED] Fiver, North Korea executed their team orders to perfection.

There was a lot of severe swearing.\u201d While Son did not specify who exactly it was that was effing and jeffing severely, the smart money suggests his Portuguese manager Paulo Bento was definitely among those turning the air blue. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a good match at all,\u201d he fumed. \u201cWe didn\u2019t execute what we\u2019d prepared.\u201d By contrast, according to [REDACTED] [REDACTED] REDACTED] Fiver, North Korea executed their team orders to perfection. Which is just as well really, as history suggests failure to do so might well have resulted in serious post-match repercussions for the guilty parties. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cI remember the Brighton fans singing: \u2018Seagulls! Seagulls!\u2019 despite the scoreline. And the Liverpool fans responded: \u2018Seaweed! Seaweed!\u2019 Scouse humour, huh?\u201d \u2013 Ralf Rangnick gets his chat on with Ben Lyttleton about the philosophy that has made him so sought-after, plus his time on the south coast at Sussex University. FIVER LETTERS \u201cYesterday\u2019s Fiver actually provided the perfect antidote to its own moans about having to suffer the abject anti-football served up by Mick McCarthy\u2019s O\u2019Ireland 2.0. You mentioned in Bits and Bobs the \u2018footballing feast\u2019 served up by Koreas North and South in their 0-0 World Cup qualifier played in front of no fans or foreign media. So we could go from famine to feast just by closing the doors. I\u2019m sure you lot in the English media would back the idea of not having to watch the Republic; I know the Irish fans certainly would\u201d \u2013 Justin Kavanagh. \u201cAs a long-suffering supporter of misery\u2019s Vancouver Canucks, I took particular joy in the aftermath of Canada\u2019s glorious 2-0 thrashing of USA! USA!! USA!!! this Tuesday past. I couldn\u2019t help but giggle in recognition as a Canadian triumph was met with calls for the opposing gaffer\u2019s head. Many NHL teams over the years have reacted similarly after (historically rare) losses at the hands of my beloved Canucks. It truly is a hallmark of consistent futility\u201d \u2013 Angus MacLean. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport. Today\u2019s winner of our letters o\u2019the day is \u2026 Justin Kavanagh, who wins a copy of Per Mertesacker: Big Friendly German. We\u2019ve one more to give away. RECOMMENDED LISTENING A special edition of Football Weekly can be found right here, while Extra will be around here later. NEWS, BITS AND BOBS Mesut \u00d6zil has spoken for the first time about being at the centre of an attempted carjacking alongside his wife Amine and Arsenal teammate Sead Kolasinac. \u201cI was scared about my wife,\u201d he said. \u201cI was scared about Sead. I wasn\u2019t thinking about myself.\u201d Former England footballer Paul Gascoigne has been found not guilty of sexually assaulting a woman he kissed on a train. Leaving the dock, he said: \u201cThank you, your honour, thank you to the jury, and thank you to my dentist.\u201d Busy La Liga suits fancy having another poke at the bear that is regular-season games in Miami. This time it\u2019s Villarreal v Atl\u00e9tico Madrid on 6 December in their sights. \u201cWe hope that this time we can carry out this positive action for everyone, as other leagues like the NFL or the NBA do when they stage matches overseas,\u201d parped Javier Teba$. Manchester City boss Nick Cushing isn\u2019t sweating, despite a late Atl\u00e9tico Madrid goal holding his team to a 1-1 draw in their Women\u2019s Big Cup first leg. \u201cThe away goal means zero,\u201d he tooted, incorrectly. \u201cWe had it last year and got beat. I think the away goals only really matter if you score again in the second leg.\u201d Arsenal won 5-2 at Slavia Prague, while Glasgow City beat Br\u00f8ndby 2-0 on the road. Sunderland\u2019s new manager is Phil Parkinson. \u201cSunderland\u2019s immense history [tick \u2013 Fiver Ed], the passion of its fanbase [tick \u2013 Fiver Ed] and its wonderful facilities are legendary within the game [tickety-tick-tick \u2013 Fiver Ed],\u201d he cheered. Colombian players will go on strike in a long-standing dispute over working conditions. \u201cWhen your employers don\u2019t listen to your demands the law allows you to use this mechanism to pressure them into listening,\u201d tooted Carlos Gonzalez of the players\u2019 union, Acolfutpro. And from the Fun and Games in South America Dept: an angry politician in Rio de Janeiro wants to ban Flamengo from using VAR. \u201cFootball brings joy to people and the VAR is spoiling it for everybody,\u201d sniffed Antonio de Azevedo. \u201cWe know what time the game starts but we no longer know when it will end because the VAR takes up so much time. The goals go in and we have to wait before we can celebrate.\u201d STILL WANT MORE? Liverpool have leaders on the field, Manchester United do not, says Eni Aluko in her latest column, while Rob Smyth muses that Big Ole needs more time, the alternative being long-term failure under loads of different managers. And Paul Wilson wonders whether Liverpool\u2019s long winning run is healthy for the Premier League. Matt Walker on the \u201cjoys\u201d of watching the worst top-flight team in Europe. Taxpayers FC\u2019s push for Europe will depend considerably on Felipe Anderson, reckons Jacob Steinberg. Black managers Marc\u00e3o and Roger have joined forces at the Maracan\u00e3 to condemn racism in Bolsanaro\u2019s Brazil.

Get over it. There is going to be political influence in foreign policy. Elections have consequences.\u201d</p> \n<p>Mulvaney\u2019s comments appeared to reflect a change in White House tactics. The administration is no longer denying there was a political trade-off in relations with Kyiv, after multiple officials have testified that there was.</p> \n<p>Sondland is the sixth US official to give evidence at impeachment hearings, and all the more significant because he was a Trump loyalist who was at the centre of deliberations on how to deal with Ukraine. His statement reflects a defection from Trump\u2019s ranks and a further sign that the president\u2019s efforts to gag public servants have failed.</p> \n<p>Sondland had first been due to give testimony on 8 October but was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/08/impeachment-donald-trump-gordon-sondland-testimony-house-democrats\">blocked from appearing by the Trump administration</a>. After the House committees issued a subpoena, Sondland defied state department orders, saying he was keen to testify.</p> \n<p>The ambassador to the EU testified that Trump personally directed the drive to make the investigation a condition for a phone call from Trump to Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and a White House visit for the new Ukrainian president.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump instructed US diplomats to go through his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to make the Ukrainian president\u2019s access to the White House dependent on launching investigations into Trump\u2019s political opponents, the US ambassador to the EU has testified. In his opening statement to Congress on Thursday, Gordon Sondland, a wealthy hotelier and Trump donor, sought to distance himself from the president, saying he had been \u201cdisappointed\u201d Trump had chosen to conduct an important strategic relationship through his lawyer. But Sondland insisted he only realised later that the aim of the investigations Trump was demanding was to target the Democratic party and a potential rival for the presidency in 2020, Joe Biden. He claimed, for example, he was not aware at the time of his negotiations with Ukraine that Burisma, an energy company Giuliani specifically named, had employed Hunter Biden, the former vice-president\u2019s son. The White House denounced the impeachment hearings as a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d on Thursday, but it admitted that military aid to Ukraine was suspended in part because Trump wanted to investigate a far-right conspiracy theory that the Democratic National Committee (DNC) internet server had been located in Ukraine to shield it from scrutiny, and that Russia had been framed for interfering in the 2016 election. Tom Bossert, who served as Trump\u2019s first homeland security adviser, said last month that he had told the president the theory was groundless. Asked if the administration had offered Ukraine a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d, the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, replied: \u201cWe do that all the time with foreign policy \u2026 I have news for everybody. Get over it. There is going to be political influence in foreign policy. Elections have consequences.\u201d Mulvaney\u2019s comments appeared to reflect a change in White House tactics. The administration is no longer denying there was a political trade-off in relations with Kyiv, after multiple officials have testified that there was. Sondland is the sixth US official to give evidence at impeachment hearings, and all the more significant because he was a Trump loyalist who was at the centre of deliberations on how to deal with Ukraine. His statement reflects a defection from Trump\u2019s ranks and a further sign that the president\u2019s efforts to gag public servants have failed. Sondland had first been due to give testimony on 8 October but was blocked from appearing by the Trump administration. After the House committees issued a subpoena, Sondland defied state department orders, saying he was keen to testify. The ambassador to the EU testified that Trump personally directed the drive to make the investigation a condition for a phone call from Trump to Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and a White House visit for the new Ukrainian president. It is a significant point in the impeachment proceedings being held by three House committees, which are looking for evidence Trump abused his office for political gain. The key event in Sondland\u2019s narrative is a 23 May White House meeting with Trump attended by Sondland, the former Ukraine special envoy Kurt Volker and the energy secretary, Rick Perry. The three had just returned from Zelenskiy\u2019s inauguration and were trying to persuade Trump to have a telephone conversation with his new Ukrainian counterpart and invite him to the White House, as a mark of US support. \u201cHowever, President Trump was skeptical that Ukraine was serious about reforms and anti-corruption, and he directed those of us present at the meeting to talk to Mr Giuliani, his personal attorney, about his concerns,\u201d Sondland said. \u201cIt was apparent to all of us that the key to changing the president\u2019s mind on Ukraine was Mr Giuliani. \u201cIndeed, Secretary Perry, Ambassador Volker and I were disappointed by our 23 May 2019 White House debriefing,\u201d Sondland said. \u201cWe strongly believed that a call and White House meeting between Presidents Trump and Zelenskiy was important and that these should be scheduled promptly and without any preconditions. \u201cWe were also disappointed by the president\u2019s direction that we involve Mr Giuliani,\u201d Sondland added. \u201cOur view was that the men and women of the state department, not the president\u2019s personal lawyer, should take responsibility for all aspects of US foreign policy towards Ukraine. \u201cHowever, based on the president\u2019s direction, we were faced with a choice,\u201d Sondland argued.

Sondland added: \u201c[M]y understanding was that the president directed Mr Giuliani\u2019s participation, that Mr Giuliani was expressing the concerns of the president.\u201d He also claimed he was not aware at the time that $400m in US military aid had been withheld from Ukraine to add to the pressure on Zelenskiy. Sondland stated that such actions would be wrong but insisted he did not participate in them.",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has three days in which to persuade the European council to sign off a new draft withdrawal agreement and pass the same document through parliament, if the UK is to pass a Brexit deal and leave the EU by 31 October \u2013 a Herculean task that could end in failure. Here is a run down of events, and some of the obstacles the prime minister must overcome, if that is to happen. What is happening now? Johnson flew to Brussels on Thursday, with a proposed deal that contains a revised protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, and a new political declaration on the future EU-UK relationship. The proposed deal has so far received cautious support from key EU figures including the chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, and the European council president, Donald Tusk. The PM is also meeting other key EU leaders, including the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. Does this mean the UK will leave on 31 October? For that to happen, the EU council, which meets on Thursday, should authorise the signature of the withdrawal agreement, before sending it to the European parliament for its consent. This is expected to be a formality. Johnson is likely to face difficulties once he returns to Westminster on Friday, ahead of a highly unusual Saturday sitting of the House of Commons, when he will attempt to persuade MPs to pass his deal in what would be a fourth meaningful vote on a Brexit deal. If all that goes to plan \u2013 and it is a very big if \u2013 the UK will leave the EU on Halloween. What has been agreed between the EU and the UK? The new proposal avoids a hard border across the island of Ireland; Northern Ireland would remain aligned to a limited set of single market rules and remain part of the UK\u2019s customs territory. The Northern Ireland assembly would have a voice on the long-term application of relevant EU law in Northern Ireland. Crucially, this would mean the deal would only have to achieve majority support from assembly members, not a \u201cdouble lock\u201d from representatives from both communities, as demanded by the DUP. What has happened with the DUP? The Northern Ireland party\u2019s position is important if the government is to pass the deal. Not only does it carry 10 votes, it also wields influence over some hardline Tory Brexiters and Johnson is far short of a majority in the Commons. The DUP released a statement on Thursday morning saying it could not support Johnson\u2019s proposals because of what had been \u201csuggested on customs and consent issues\u201d. The party added there was \u201ca lack of clarity on VAT\u201d. Does the confidence and supply deal with the DUP still stand? The agreement between the Tories and the DUP, which has propped up the government since Theresa May\u2019s 2017 general election, has not yet been commented upon by the DUP. Government sources have pointed out that the DUP continued to support May\u2019s government after voting against her Brexit deal. What does Johnson need to do now? The prime minister\u2019s biggest hurdle will be passing the proposed deal through parliament. There has been movement in the Commons since March \u2013 the last time a deal was brought before MPs. The most significant of these was the expulsion of 21 Conservative rebels from the party after they voted against the government. Johnson now rules with a minority, with 43 fewer voting members than the opposition. He has a deficit of 58 votes to overcome from when May\u2019s withdrawal agreement was defeated for a third time. It is unlikely that he would lose many of the 286 MPs who voted for a deal last time around, leaving him with the task of winning at least 30 extra MPs over to his cause. For this, he could turn to the European Research Group and the \u201cSpartans\u201d \u2013 about 80 Eurosceptic Tories who opposed May\u2019s deal; the 21 expelled Tories who may be persuaded to back a deal to stop a no-deal Brexit; and Labour rebels, 19 of whom signed a letter to the EU asking them to agree a deal with Johnson so they could vote for it. DUP sources delivered a blow to the prime minister on Thursday night when they said they would vote against his deal rather than abstain. If he fails, will the PM apply for an extension or will the UK crash out? The Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, indicated the UK will ask for an extension on Wednesday, when he said the government would stay within the law and carry out the will of parliament as outlined in the Benn act. However, some No 10 sources have claimed Johnson could send a second letter, withdrawing the first, allowing the UK to leave without a deal. Barclay told MPs he knew of no such plan. Even if the prime minister requests an extension there is no guarantee the EU27 would agree.",

Their \u201cblood-red line\u201d has been crossed by putting a hard customs border down the Irish Sea, dividing them from the rest of the UK. They have lost the veto they wanted, reduced to a vote only held four years after the dual customs union comes into effect, aligned with the EU \u2013 and even then, they would have to wait for another two-year cooling-off period.</p> <p>These devilishly good DUP negotiators usually succeed because their No Surrender reputation has the other side of the table believing their stony faces are unmovable. But this time it looks as though Boris Johnson has thrown them under another of his mendacious buses. Of course this could be a last-minute DUP bluff. There are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/oct/17/eu-leaders-gather-for-summit-as-boris-johnson-scrambles-to-get-backing-for-brexit-deal-politics-live?page=with:block-5da850498f08c78d1cb4e0f7#block-5da850498f08c78d1cb4e0f7\" title=\"\">rumours</a> not only of a new medical school and a motorway, but also a daintily gift-wrapped \u201cpeace fund\u201d, paid by the UK with EU contributions via the Irish government. However, the biblically well-versed DUP won\u2019t be trading their birthright for that mess of pottage.</p> <p>If no means no, that\u2019s a heavy blow for Johnson \u2013 but even with DUP votes he can\u2019t know if there are the numbers to push the deal through parliament. Johnson is back exactly where Theresa May was at Chequers with an EU deal agreed only to be blocked at Westminster \u2013 it would be a dose of his own medicine, as he was her prime rebel. Besides, his deal is far worse than May\u2019s for the many Tory soft-leaver MPs who were once assured the UK would always keep close to Europe: this makes all borders rock hard, a lethal barrier to vital just-in-time trade.</p> <p>ERG Europhobes may like this deal better than the last, but they have been mainlining hopes of a no-deal crash out. Will they follow the DUP lead, as they once promised? Then up jumps Nigel Farage <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nigel_Farage/status/1184790307164037121\" title=\"\">to declare</a> \u201cthe \u2018new deal\u2019 is not Brexit\u201d, frightening the life out of Tory MPs in marginal seats.</p> <p>Johnson chose to try to appease the ERGs, abandoning hope of those <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/13/labour-destroyed-if-leave-mps-help-boris-johnson-win-brexit-majority\" title=\"\">19 Labour MPs who wrote to the European Commission</a> president, Jean-Claude Juncker, backing a deal if it met their red lines. None of the red lines required by Stephen Kinnock and the others have been met, as \u201clevel playing field\u201d alignment on regulations is moved from the withdrawal agreement into the non-binding political statement. As Downing Street asserts through <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Peston/status/1184813194054983682\" title=\"\">a source to Robert Peston</a>: \u201cBritain is out of all EU laws. We will be able to change our laws in a huge number of areas from product standards to fishing rules and farming subsidies where we are currently bound by EU rules.\u201d Just so. That is precisely what the Europhobes always wanted, the deregulated purpose of the whole Brexit fandango. Food safety and working conditions, traditionally well ahead of UK standards, will now be at the mercy of this Brexit government. Very few in Labour could tolerate that.</p> <p>This deal unites Labour, and even fires up Jeremy Corbyn to cast aside his ancient scepticism and at last put his shoulder to the cause of killing it off. Today Labour was calling for a confirmatory referendum: ask the voters if this is really what they want? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeremycorbyn/status/1184778593412538370\" title=\"\">As Corbyn says</a>, this deal \u201crisks triggering a race to the bottom on rights and protections: putting food safety at risk, cutting environmental standards and workers\u2019 rights, and opening up our NHS to a takeover by US private corporations\u201d.</p> <p>There is a tide in politics, a natural surge towards resolution after years of excruciation and paralysis. Is the Get It Done sentiment so strong at Westminster that it will sweep aside doubters on all sides? MPs know that nothing is \u201cdone\u201d if they sign up to Johnson\u2019s deal: it\u2019s only the beginning of unending torment over the economy-defining negotiations on customs, tariffs and regulations, where as an outsider the UK will have the weakest hand. Brexeternity beckons.</p> <p>Johnson may not get his vote, and his own absurd \u201cdie in a ditch\u201d pledges will make a forced extension a humiliation. The last chance to get his deal agreed would be to accept the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/17/compromise-brexit-deal-phil-wilson-peter-kyle\" title=\"\">Kyle-Wilson amendment for a confirmatory referendum ballot,</a> which would see the Commons overwhelmingly pass it.

      "bodyText": "The red hand of Ulster says no. Their \u201cblood-red line\u201d has been crossed by putting a hard customs border down the Irish Sea, dividing them from the rest of the UK. They have lost the veto they wanted, reduced to a vote only held four years after the dual customs union comes into effect, aligned with the EU \u2013 and even then, they would have to wait for another two-year cooling-off period. These devilishly good DUP negotiators usually succeed because their No Surrender reputation has the other side of the table believing their stony faces are unmovable. But this time it looks as though Boris Johnson has thrown them under another of his mendacious buses. Of course this could be a last-minute DUP bluff. There are rumours not only of a new medical school and a motorway, but also a daintily gift-wrapped \u201cpeace fund\u201d, paid by the UK with EU contributions via the Irish government. However, the biblically well-versed DUP won\u2019t be trading their birthright for that mess of pottage. If no means no, that\u2019s a heavy blow for Johnson \u2013 but even with DUP votes he can\u2019t know if there are the numbers to push the deal through parliament. Johnson is back exactly where Theresa May was at Chequers with an EU deal agreed only to be blocked at Westminster \u2013 it would be a dose of his own medicine, as he was her prime rebel. Besides, his deal is far worse than May\u2019s for the many Tory soft-leaver MPs who were once assured the UK would always keep close to Europe: this makes all borders rock hard, a lethal barrier to vital just-in-time trade. ERG Europhobes may like this deal better than the last, but they have been mainlining hopes of a no-deal crash out. Will they follow the DUP lead, as they once promised? Then up jumps Nigel Farage to declare \u201cthe \u2018new deal\u2019 is not Brexit\u201d, frightening the life out of Tory MPs in marginal seats. Johnson chose to try to appease the ERGs, abandoning hope of those 19 Labour MPs who wrote to the European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, backing a deal if it met their red lines. None of the red lines required by Stephen Kinnock and the others have been met, as \u201clevel playing field\u201d alignment on regulations is moved from the withdrawal agreement into the non-binding political statement. As Downing Street asserts through a source to Robert Peston: \u201cBritain is out of all EU laws. We will be able to change our laws in a huge number of areas from product standards to fishing rules and farming subsidies where we are currently bound by EU rules.\u201d Just so. That is precisely what the Europhobes always wanted, the deregulated purpose of the whole Brexit fandango. Food safety and working conditions, traditionally well ahead of UK standards, will now be at the mercy of this Brexit government. Very few in Labour could tolerate that. This deal unites Labour, and even fires up Jeremy Corbyn to cast aside his ancient scepticism and at last put his shoulder to the cause of killing it off. Today Labour was calling for a confirmatory referendum: ask the voters if this is really what they want? As Corbyn says, this deal \u201crisks triggering a race to the bottom on rights and protections: putting food safety at risk, cutting environmental standards and workers\u2019 rights, and opening up our NHS to a takeover by US private corporations\u201d. There is a tide in politics, a natural surge towards resolution after years of excruciation and paralysis. Is the Get It Done sentiment so strong at Westminster that it will sweep aside doubters on all sides? MPs know that nothing is \u201cdone\u201d if they sign up to Johnson\u2019s deal: it\u2019s only the beginning of unending torment over the economy-defining negotiations on customs, tariffs and regulations, where as an outsider the UK will have the weakest hand. Brexeternity beckons. Johnson may not get his vote, and his own absurd \u201cdie in a ditch\u201d pledges will make a forced extension a humiliation. The last chance to get his deal agreed would be to accept the Kyle-Wilson amendment for a confirmatory referendum ballot, which would see the Commons overwhelmingly pass it. That ends the impasse once and for all. If leave wins again, the agreement is ready to sign the next day \u2013 and those long, hard future negotiations begin. If remain wins, Brexit could be stopped in its tracks. Labour would whip its MPs to back it, along with the SNP, Liberal Democrats, Greens and Plaid Cymru \u2013 plus a growing numbers of Tories of the Dominic Grieve/Justine Greening variety. Many shudder at the prospect of five long months of a referendum campaign that would be more bitter, more mendacious and savage than the last.

A packed Labour for a Public Vote meeting in the Commons last night discussed ways to run a grassroots campaign, making the remain side a fiery insurgency, with greater input from young people and women; it could hardly be worse than the 2016 fiasco.

      "bodyText": "Whisper it quietly, but often it\u2019s much simpler to push an old-fashioned light switch than to shout three or four times at a hard-of-hearing voice-activated smart assistant. And, let\u2019s face it, do workplace managers really want to install motion scanners under the desks of their employees to see who takes the longest toilet breaks? Sure, it\u2019s obviously important for businesses to stay on top of tech advances, but there\u2019s a thin line between innovating with purpose and innovating just for the sake of it. Ryan Abbott, professor of law and health sciences at the University of Surrey, specialises in the impact of AI, machine learning and technological advances, but even he believes that common sense sometimes makes more sense than deep learning: \u201cIt\u2019s not clear there\u2019s value to technology for technology\u2019s sake and people may adopt it for the wrong reasons \u2013 maybe because there\u2019s hype associated with it, rather than considering whether it\u2019s really efficient to use things like artificial intelligence for different tasks.\u201d His mother, for instance, wasn\u2019t convinced of the value of one smart feature on her new car. \u201cMy mother recently purchased a car, which at the press of a button can turn into Santa [mode]. She hasn\u2019t figured out how to disable it, so she\u2019s driving around in a Christmas mobile that plays Christmas tunes,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s of questionable value, particularly in the summer.\u201d He\u2019s also less than convinced about all of his smart watch features: \u201cI\u2019m not sure I need my watch to tell me to breathe every five seconds either. I\u2019m not sure it does much more than raise my blood pressure.\u201d Bear in mind that there\u2019s a litany of wonder-technology fads that led nowhere. Do you see many people wearing their computer screen in their glasses? Or using their telephones to monitor whether their toothbrush is scrubbing those hard-to-reach parts? A few years ago, the travel industry got very excited when Icelandair became the first ever airline to allow people to book flights through Facebook Messenger via a booking bot.

      "body": "<p>The mood-boosting power of pets is proven, and dog owners are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/04/is-owning-a-dog-good-for-your-health\">23% less likely to die from heart disease</a> than those who don\u2019t have a pooch. It\u2019s clear that bringing a dog into your home has numerous mental and physical health benefits, but your new arrival\u2019s wellbeing is just as important; the care it receives in those first few months will influence their lifetime health and happiness.</p> <p>Owning a puppy isn\u2019t all snuggles and walkies, however. There\u2019s the chewed-up trainers and the night-time wailing, too. But if you can support your puppy through the ups as well as the downs of early life, you\u2019ll both reap the rewards down the line. Dr Karlien Heyrman, head of pets at Pets at Home, offers advice on what you can expect from your pooch in the first six months.</p> <h2>Getting home: eight to 12 weeks old</h2> <p><strong>Crying<br></strong>Puppies generally leave their mothers when they are fully weaned, at around eight weeks old. When a puppy leaves their mother, they will need time to feel safe in the new environment. Night-time can be lonely; everything is new and, not unlike small children, they will respond with crying that can sound like a howl of pain.</p> <p>Handle this by putting your puppy in a travel crate near you all the time, says Huw Stacey, director of clinical services at Vets4Pets. \u201cKeep the crate right next to your bed for the first few nights, then gradually move it a couple of feet towards the bedroom door each night, then down the hall, until you slowly wean your puppy to sleeping where you want them to.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Food<br></strong>Heyrman recommends initially keeping your puppy on the same food they ate before they came to you, as changing too quickly will upset their stomach. Gradually mix in a new food if you are changing to something else. Pets at Home offers free <a href=\"https://www.petsathome.com/shop/en/pets/dog-nutrition-consultations\" rel=\"nofollow\">nutritional consultations</a> to help with this.</p> <p><strong>Vaccinations<br></strong>Ask the previous owner or breeder what vaccinations, worming and flea treatments your puppy has already had, and confirm with a vet. It\u2019s important to ensure their health treatments are topped up as, just like babies, their immune systems aren\u2019t at full strength. Puppies usually finish their vaccination course at approximately 12 weeks old.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"922c5337c8652644a775d4e433179f24946825f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/922c5337c8652644a775d4e433179f24946825f2/0_0_3847_2588/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Closeup cleaning dog\u2019s teeth with toothbrush for pet health care concept, selective focus\" width=\"1000\" height=\"673\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brush your pup\u2019s teeth with a especially-designed dog toothbrush.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: mraoraor/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Teeth, toilet and training: 12 to 16 weeks old</h2> <p><strong>Teething<br></strong>Between 12 and 16 weeks, puppies start teething. In this period, they start losing their milk teeth and begin growing their adult teeth by the six-month period. Heyrman suggests hiding your best shoes, lest you wake up to find them at a fraction of their former glory. Your puppy might bite people too \u2013 which is often just part of them playing and nothing to be afraid of, but giving them a toy can help direct this behaviour towards toys while they learn appropriate behaviour \u2013 so be aware of any young children around them. It\u2019s not indicative of how they will act as an adult, but it\u2019s a good opportunity to teach your pet what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong. When you stroke your puppy, provide an affirming \u201cyes\u201d if they keep their jaw at bay, and reward with a treat. Heyrman also advises that dogs should have their teeth brushed once a day. <a href=\"https://www.petsathome.com/shop/en/pets/toothbrush\" rel=\"nofollow\">Toothbrushes</a> designed especially for dogs are available to buy, and it is best to start them young.</p> <p><strong>Toilet training<br></strong>Dogs need considerable guidance when it comes to toilet training. Do you want to wake up and see your little pup, as adorable as they are, weeing all over your new bed sheets? Luckily, it\u2019s avoidable. Observe your puppy in order to understand how often they go to the toilet, move them to the appropriate spot, and lavish your pooch with praise when they go. Like babies, their bladders are small. And even more like babies, they don\u2019t ask for permission.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/raising-cats-and-dogs/2019/oct/16/owning-a-kitten-or-puppy-myth-v-reality\">Owning a kitten or puppy: myth v reality</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Obedience training<br></strong>At this point, you can begin to teach your pup simple commands such as \u201csit\u201d, \u201clie down\u201d, \u201ccome\u201d and, of course, their name. Remember that puppies have short attention spans, so limit training to short, regular bursts. Keep your training positive, rewarding the correct behaviour and not lambasting your pooch when they get things wrong.</p> <h2>Continue socialisation and stimulation: 16 weeks</h2> <p><strong>Stimulation<br></strong>Play helps puppies develop the skills they\u2019ll need in adulthood, so ensure they have plenty of <a href=\"https://www.petsathome.com/shop/en/pets/dog/puppy/puppy-toys\" rel=\"nofollow\">puppy-friendly toys</a> to keep them entertained. Heyrman notes that puppies can become overstimulated, and intense sounds such as vacuum cleaners can be extremely frightening. Make sure you get your pooch used to these new experiences in a gradual and controlled manner from the moment you acquire your new puppy.</p> <p><strong>Walkies<br></strong>Walking is vital both for exercise and socialisation, but in these early weeks it\u2019s best not to overexert your pup. They need to gradually be introduced to busy human environments, such as parks, so being vaccinated is essential before exploring the big wide world. It is also very important to not over exercise puppies. Heyrman suggests five minutes of exercise per month of age of the dog up to twice a day while it\u2019s still a puppy, but it varies on the size and breed of the dog.</p> <p><strong>Socialisation<br></strong>As soon as your puppy is vaccinated, it\u2019s important to allow them to begin meeting other humans \u2013 especially ones they\u2019re likely to come into contact with frequently \u2013 and other dogs. You can often find locally organised \u201cpuppy parties\u201d, where puppies can meet and play with each other in a safe environment, and walks will give your pup the chance to meet adult dogs. Puppy training classes also help dogs learn how to be around other dogs. When socialising your pup around children, keep a close watch as negative interactions with kids can teach your puppy to be anxious around children in the future. Remember, dogs have their own personalities, just like humans \u2013 if your pooch seems shy, don\u2019t force too much socialisation all at once.</p> <h2>Neutering: 20 to 24 weeks</h2> <p>It seems mean, but the big snip/scoop helps prevent long-term health problems for your dog, as well as any unexpected litters \u2013 though it\u2019s best to discuss with your vet when you should do this, as the best age to neuter depends on the individual dog.</p> <p>This is particularly important with female pups \u2013 spaying before her first estrous cycle cuts the risk of developing mammary cancer. Waiting just one cycle will <a href=\"https://www.petmd.com/dog/conditions/cancer/c_dg_mammary_gland_tumor\" rel=\"nofollow\">increase the chances of the illness developing by 8%</a>.</p> <p><em><strong>Join the free Pets at Home <a href=\"https://www.petsathome.com/shop/en/pets/promotions/puppy-club?utm_source=theguardian.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=guardian_newpet_partnership&amp;cm_mmc=referral-referral_sitereferral_link_-guardian_newpet_partnership&amp;ita=1976&amp;ito=guardian_newpet_partnersh\" rel=\"nofollow\">VIP puppy club</a> today to receive 10% off your pet\u2019s first shop along with exclusive offers, advice and rewards until their first birthday</strong></em></p>",

      "bodyText": "The mood-boosting power of pets is proven, and dog owners are 23% less likely to die from heart disease than those who don\u2019t have a pooch. It\u2019s clear that bringing a dog into your home has numerous mental and physical health benefits, but your new arrival\u2019s wellbeing is just as important; the care it receives in those first few months will influence their lifetime health and happiness. Owning a puppy isn\u2019t all snuggles and walkies, however. There\u2019s the chewed-up trainers and the night-time wailing, too. But if you can support your puppy through the ups as well as the downs of early life, you\u2019ll both reap the rewards down the line. Dr Karlien Heyrman, head of pets at Pets at Home, offers advice on what you can expect from your pooch in the first six months. Getting home: eight to 12 weeks old Crying Puppies generally leave their mothers when they are fully weaned, at around eight weeks old. When a puppy leaves their mother, they will need time to feel safe in the new environment. Night-time can be lonely; everything is new and, not unlike small children, they will respond with crying that can sound like a howl of pain. Handle this by putting your puppy in a travel crate near you all the time, says Huw Stacey, director of clinical services at Vets4Pets. \u201cKeep the crate right next to your bed for the first few nights, then gradually move it a couple of feet towards the bedroom door each night, then down the hall, until you slowly wean your puppy to sleeping where you want them to.\u201d Food Heyrman recommends initially keeping your puppy on the same food they ate before they came to you, as changing too quickly will upset their stomach. Gradually mix in a new food if you are changing to something else. Pets at Home offers free nutritional consultations to help with this. Vaccinations Ask the previous owner or breeder what vaccinations, worming and flea treatments your puppy has already had, and confirm with a vet. It\u2019s important to ensure their health treatments are topped up as, just like babies, their immune systems aren\u2019t at full strength. Puppies usually finish their vaccination course at approximately 12 weeks old. Teeth, toilet and training: 12 to 16 weeks old Teething Between 12 and 16 weeks, puppies start teething. In this period, they start losing their milk teeth and begin growing their adult teeth by the six-month period. Heyrman suggests hiding your best shoes, lest you wake up to find them at a fraction of their former glory. Your puppy might bite people too \u2013 which is often just part of them playing and nothing to be afraid of, but giving them a toy can help direct this behaviour towards toys while they learn appropriate behaviour \u2013 so be aware of any young children around them. It\u2019s not indicative of how they will act as an adult, but it\u2019s a good opportunity to teach your pet what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong. When you stroke your puppy, provide an affirming \u201cyes\u201d if they keep their jaw at bay, and reward with a treat. Heyrman also advises that dogs should have their teeth brushed once a day. Toothbrushes designed especially for dogs are available to buy, and it is best to start them young. Toilet training Dogs need considerable guidance when it comes to toilet training. Do you want to wake up and see your little pup, as adorable as they are, weeing all over your new bed sheets? Luckily, it\u2019s avoidable. Observe your puppy in order to understand how often they go to the toilet, move them to the appropriate spot, and lavish your pooch with praise when they go. Like babies, their bladders are small. And even more like babies, they don\u2019t ask for permission. Obedience training At this point, you can begin to teach your pup simple commands such as \u201csit\u201d, \u201clie down\u201d, \u201ccome\u201d and, of course, their name. Remember that puppies have short attention spans, so limit training to short, regular bursts. Keep your training positive, rewarding the correct behaviour and not lambasting your pooch when they get things wrong. Continue socialisation and stimulation: 16 weeks Stimulation Play helps puppies develop the skills they\u2019ll need in adulthood, so ensure they have plenty of puppy-friendly toys to keep them entertained. Heyrman notes that puppies can become overstimulated, and intense sounds such as vacuum cleaners can be extremely frightening. Make sure you get your pooch used to these new experiences in a gradual and controlled manner from the moment you acquire your new puppy. Walkies Walking is vital both for exercise and socialisation, but in these early weeks it\u2019s best not to overexert your pup. They need to gradually be introduced to busy human environments, such as parks, so being vaccinated is essential before exploring the big wide world. It is also very important to not over exercise puppies. Heyrman suggests five minutes of exercise per month of age of the dog up to twice a day while it\u2019s still a puppy, but it varies on the size and breed of the dog. Socialisation As soon as your puppy is vaccinated, it\u2019s important to allow them to begin meeting other humans \u2013 especially ones they\u2019re likely to come into contact with frequently \u2013 and other dogs. You can often find locally organised \u201cpuppy parties\u201d, where puppies can meet and play with each other in a safe environment, and walks will give your pup the chance to meet adult dogs. Puppy training classes also help dogs learn how to be around other dogs. When socialising your pup around children, keep a close watch as negative interactions with kids can teach your puppy to be anxious around children in the future. Remember, dogs have their own personalities, just like humans \u2013 if your pooch seems shy, don\u2019t force too much socialisation all at once. Neutering: 20 to 24 weeks It seems mean, but the big snip/scoop helps prevent long-term health problems for your dog, as well as any unexpected litters \u2013 though it\u2019s best to discuss with your vet when you should do this, as the best age to neuter depends on the individual dog. This is particularly important with female pups \u2013 spaying before her first estrous cycle cuts the risk of developing mammary cancer. Waiting just one cycle will increase the chances of the illness developing by 8%.

      "body": "<h2>37. 11\u201909\u201d01 September 11 (segment \u201cUnited Kingdom\u201d) (2002)</h2> <p>Ken Loach\u2019s contribution to this short-film package of film-makers\u2019 responses to 9/11 is a perfectly serviceable account of a different September 11: an activist\u2019s letter to America about the coup against President Salvador Allende in Chile in 1973. At the time it seemed jarring, and in retrospect very much not what was needed; but it\u2019s not the worst of the bunch \u2013 Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu gets <em>nul points</em> for incorporating footage of people jumping from the collapsing World Trade Center in a sound/image collage.</p> <h2>36. The End of Arthur\u2019s Marriage (1965)</h2> <p>A somewhat supercilious satire on the property-owning middle classes that Loach later admitted he was the wrong director for: a little bit Fassbinder, a little bit <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053538/\">Gurney Slade</a>. It played into Loach\u2019s favourite theme \u2013 the little man against the system \u2013 but the director\u2019s instincts are not best served by wackiness. A shame, as it throws away a great lead performance by<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-26186650\"> Ken Jones</a>, a regular Loach collaborator, and later immortalised as the prison snitch Ives in Porridge.</p> <h2>35. Fatherland (1986)</h2> <p>Not an adaptation of the Robert Harris alternative-history novel, but a patchy account of an East German musician as unhappy under communism as he is in the west. This is Loach\u2019s signature theme \u2013 systems and authority of any kind are open to abuse \u2013 but he is never at his best with non-English-speaking characters and this film (almost entirely in German) is not exactly a triumph.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3ebd37c286099851a4e348a2ec1b8392ce6b7dd6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ebd37c286099851a4e348a2ec1b8392ce6b7dd6/44_92_6426_3856/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gerulf Pannach and Fabienne Babe in Fatherland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gerulf Pannach and Fabienne Babe in Fatherland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: TCD/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>34. Tickets (2005)</h2> <p>Another package film, with Loach directing the final third after chunks from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/07/ermanno-olmi-obituary\">Ermanno Olmi</a> (The Tree of Wooden Clogs) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/abbas-kiarostami\">Abbas Kiarostami</a>. It\u2019s a clever idea \u2013 train tickets as a symbol for wider social permissions \u2013 and Loach\u2019s bit is nice but slight, with a bunch of Celtic fans squabbling among themselves whether to help an Albanian migrant family.</p> <h2>33. Three Clear Sundays (1965)</h2> <p>The earliest of Loach\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07p4vd7/episodes/guide\">Wednesday Plays</a> to survive shows his early style in full flow. A talky, digressive piece, this anti-death penalty broadside is infused with a jittery hyperactive energy as Loach sought to overcome the staid traditions of television drama. It\u2019s a bit on the stagey side, with lots of cockney chat, but the final execution scene, when poor Tony Selby is strung up for killing a prison officer, still packs a hell of a punch.</p> <h2>32. The Golden Vision (1968)</h2> <p>Loach may not be an obvious football man, but it\u2019s a thread that runs through his work. This innovative mix of drama and documentary pleasingly focuses on a cult figure from Everton\u2019s mid-60s cup-winning side: the Scottish midfielder Alex Young. Loach (as ever) is more interested in the fans and how football folds into their lives (more good work from Ken Jones), with real-life footage of Everton personnel (including Young) talking to camera about their lives. In truth, it doesn\u2019t amount to all that much, but texturally it\u2019s still pretty interesting.</p> <h2>31. The Big Flame (1969)</h2> <p>Loach really nailed his political colours to the mast with this script by the Trotskyist former docker <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituaries-jim-allen-1104568.html\">Jim Allen</a>, and in doing so proved that the intricacies of an industrial dispute could be material for compelling, if not exactly exhilarating, drama. Nevertheless, this was evidence that Loach had achieved what he had clearly been aiming at for some time: acting so planed down it was indistinguishable from reality.</p> <h2>30. Carla\u2019s Song (1996)</h2> <p>You can see the attraction of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/18/nicaraguans-jubilant-after-somoza-resignation-archive-1979\">Nicaraguan civil war</a>: one of the great international causes of the 80s. The involvement of Robert Carlyle, fresh from Trainspotting, gave this film a shot in the arm, although the somewhat saucer-eyed approach to the Latin characters \u2013 particularly Carla herself, with whose exotic mystery Carlyle\u2019s bus driver falls in love \u2013 doesn\u2019t do the film many favours.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fdc8c121ed97cb320712597f7539abe636152abf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fdc8c121ed97cb320712597f7539abe636152abf/0_44_3052_1831/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Carlyle and Oyanka Cabezas in Carla\u2019s Song\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert Carlyle and Oyanka Cabezas in Carla\u2019s Song.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar/C4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>29. Jimmy\u2019s Hall (2014)</h2> <p>An uncomplicated, comfort-zone paean to the Irish communist Jimmy Gralton, whose brand of free-thinking is too much for the local worthies in 1930s Ireland. There\u2019s not much light and shade here: Gralton (Barry Ward) is your standard crinkle-eyed nice-guy, a sacrificial lamb to the republic\u2019s new intolerance.</p> <h2>28. The Rank and File (1971)</h2> <p>Loach\u2019s mature, unadorned style emerged with this account of a labour dispute in north-west England, a BBC Play for Today that is essentially a lightly fictionalised treatment of the 1970 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-archive/gallery/2015/mar/03/direct-action-seventy-years-of-strikes-in-pictures-from-the-gnm-archive#img-5\">Pilkington glass strike</a>. It recreates the smoke-filled rooms and committee discussions, establishing that the unions and management are both conspiring to shore up a system that keeps the ordinary workers in their place. Compared to The Big Flame, which covers not dissimilar ground, this is a sober, unblinking treatment, eliminating the flourishes of his 60s work. Heavy-duty stuff.</p> <h2>27. In Two Minds (1967)</h2> <p>While there is something fundamentally naive in this film\u2019s analysis of mental illness \u2013 merging <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jun/01/mentalhealth.society\">RD Laing</a>\u2019s anti-organic thesis with his own politics, Loach aims to pin responsibility for its subject\u2019s schizophrenia on \u201csocial conditions\u201d, namely, Kate\u2019s poor relationship with her mother \u2013 this is high-achieving formally. Formatted as a documentary, with a stream of \u201cinterviews\u201d and voiceover, this is fiction disguised very convincingly as fact. Unusually, Loach slips into point-of-view as the final ECT scenes approach.</p> <h2>26. Looking for Eric (2009)</h2> <p>This one is a bit of an outrider. Loach scored something of a coup by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/may/09/looking-for-eric-cantona-ken-loach\">casting the Manchester United legend Eric Cantona</a> as a sort of Play It Again, Sam-style dope-fuelled fantasy adviser to a harassed Mancunian postman. It\u2019s got its strong points, but the required wackiness isn\u2019t always there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2285e7d9d756423c043d266ff5d4c58e2bc02d44\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2285e7d9d756423c043d266ff5d4c58e2bc02d44/76_211_3590_2153/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steve Evets and Eric Cantona in Looking for Eric\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steve Evets and Eric Cantona in Looking for Eric.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>25. Route Irish (2010)</h2> <p>Named after the road into Baghdad airport, Loach\u2019s assault on the west\u2019s murky activities in Iraq focuses on the outsourcing of fighting and the subsequent corporate cover-up. It is one of his more conventional-looking films, and takes on a big target \u2013 possibly too big for the scale of film Loach is able to mount.</p> <h2>24. Family Life (1971)</h2> <p>A remake/reworking of In Two Minds, framed as a more traditional dramatic narrative and with the central character\u2019s troubled mindset more obviously triggered by the generation gap and the abortion she was made to have. Although this film follows a similar trajectory, finding environmental and social causes for her erratic behaviour, leading to seemingly brutal ECT treatment, Loach wisely retreats a little from the wider mental-illness thesis of the original.</p> <h2>23. The Angels\u2019 Share (2012)</h2> <p>A lightweight entry in Loach\u2019s Scottish cycle: a violent tearaway (played by Paul Brannigan) resolves to get out of the Glasgow gang life by stealing some valuable whisky. This actually has a happy ending (of sorts), but Loach doesn\u2019t quite succeed in making a basically vicious central character likable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"86072ac67877a0a924ef23075811c3644556e353\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86072ac67877a0a924ef23075811c3644556e353/9_64_5578_3347/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Brannigan in The Angels\u2019 Share\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">May the spirit be with you: Paul Brannigan in The Angels\u2019 Share.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wild Bunch/Sixteen/Kobal/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>22. Ae Fond Kiss \u2026 (2004)</h2> <p>This film contains one of the few non-white lead characters in Loach\u2019s work: Casim, son of Pakistani immigrants, who embarks on a forbidden relationship with Catholic school teacher Roisin. Loach\u2019s target, as ever, is the system of control that prevents ordinary people from achieving freedom in their lives; this inter-ethnic romance does a decent job in exploring religion and immigrant culture, but it isn\u2019t Loach\u2019s natural habitat.</p> <h2>21. Raining Stones (1993)</h2> <p>A likable comedy from Loach\u2019s early-90s resurgence, working from a Jim Allen script about an on-his-uppers chancer trying to scrape together enough money for a communion dress for his daughter. It\u2019s not one of his most resonant films, but is basically good natured and an excellent example of the director\u2019s unerring ability to get great performances from first-timers: the lead is <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/coronation-streets-bruce-jones-slams-14013898\">Bruce Jones</a>, who was a club-circuit comic at the time.</p> <h2>20. Ladybird, Ladybird (1994)</h2> <p>Another great spot from Loach: <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/4114914/benidorm-crissy-rock-new-fiance-holiday/\">Crissy Rock</a>, another former club comic, is tremendous as self-destructive mum Maggie, who has lost four of her children to social services after a string of disastrous relationships. Loach, characteristically, is doing his utmost to extract sympathy for one of life\u2019s casualties; there is little sympathy to spare for the council workers trying to deal with her.</p> <h2>19. Up the Junction (1965)</h2> <p>In its day, this adaptation of Nell Dunn\u2019s stories for the Wednesday Play spot was notorious for its agonised abortion/miscarriage sequence; but there\u2019s more to this than outrage. Like its predecessor <a href=\"http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1416000/index.html\">Three Clear Sundays</a>, this is a rangy, digressive portrait of street life; here it is about three young women working in a wash-house in Battersea and is a depiction of a marginalised, under-represented community that hums with life. The abortion itself is interestingly consequence-free; the three leads (who include <a href=\"https://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/features/love-letter-carol-white\">Carol White</a> in her first Loach role) are all great.</p> <h2>18. Black Jack (1979)</h2> <p>One of Loach\u2019s few attempts to make a putatively commercial \u201cfamily film\u201d: this is adapted from Leon Garfield\u2019s book about a kid in the 18th century who falls in with an itinerant, hulking villain (the Black Jack of the title), rescues a girl who has been sent to the madhouse and works for a funfair. It is unusual, interesting material for a children\u2019s film, even by 70s standards, but the flat, ultra-naturalistic acting style Loach employed works against the extravagant storyline: the whole thing could have been a bit more rollicking.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f53581abcc6339e7509b2e29a9019b74ade658d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f53581abcc6339e7509b2e29a9019b74ade658d6/0_96_3656_2193/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Black Jack\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Black Jack: full of family fun.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kestrel/Kobal/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>17. Bread and Roses (2000)</h2> <p>Loach held his nose and went to the US to make this statement-film about exploitation of immigrant workers in Los Angeles. It stars Adrien Brody as a union organiser who (wouldn\u2019t you know it?) falls in love with one of the women he is defending. Even so, Loach lands some telling sledgehammer blows, even if \u2013 outside his UK and Ireland comfort zone \u2013 much of his customary nuance is absent.</p> <h2>16. The Spirit of 45 (2013)</h2> <p>In retrospect, this looks like an early emanation of the nostalgia-socialism that helped pave the way for<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/24/labour-leadership-jeremy-corbyn-wins-landslide-victory-party\"> Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour leadership triumph two years later</a>. A compendium of interviews of warhorse campaigners and archive-clip history about Clement Attlee\u2019s landslide victory in 1945, this is just about the only Loach documentary expressly aimed at the cinema. Although its contemporary political purpose is rather over-evident, it is still a stirring vision of what used to be, and what many hoped could be again.</p> <h2>15. Hidden Agenda (1990)</h2> <p>A conspiracy thriller that marked Loach\u2019s return to feature film-making after a difficult 1980s spent trying (and often failing) to get his TV projects broadcast. As with the later Route Irish, Loach goes for a relatively mainstream style to tell an incendiary political story: here it is about British military collusion in the murder of a human rights lawyer (clearly related to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/08/pat-finucane-mi5-destroyed-investigation-files-into-alleged-collusion\">real-life killing of Pat Finucane</a>). It is a bit by-the-numbers stylewise, but it re-established Loach as a radical force.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73ae12e479ddbafa3c2a70ffa640e5b3fd45b48b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73ae12e479ddbafa3c2a70ffa640e5b3fd45b48b/0_52_2296_1377/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brian Cox and Frances McDormand in Hidden Agenda\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Radical resurgence: Brian Cox and Frances McDormand in Hidden Agenda.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: www.ronaldgrantarchive.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>14. The Gamekeeper (1980)</h2> <p>A feature-length drama made for ITV, adapted from a Barry Hines novel, and about as pared-down a piece as Loach is ever likely to make. Phil Askham is the eponymous estate worker, caught between competing loyalties and as out of place down the pub with the poacher-forgiving locals as with the capped-and-Barboured shooting gentry. There is no plot to speak of: just an incremental progression of incident (some, like rabbit hunting with ferrets, looks pretty gruesome for modern sensibilities), but it\u2019s remarkable all the same: a working life in collision with muddy, bloody nature.</p> <h2>13. The Navigators (2001)</h2> <p>Unusually, this full-length feature <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2001/dec/03/firstnight.broadcasting\">had its UK premiere on TV</a>; perhaps reflecting the popular nature of its subject: rail privatisation. Loach has always admired \u201crailwaymen\u201d for their tight organisation and solidarity: he clearly enjoyed bringing out their camaraderie in an appealing film that had self-evident real-world parallels. Staffed with the customary lineup of club comics and singers turned actors, this is Loach in confident, mid-season form.</p> <h2>12. Cathy Come Home (1966)</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/1966/nov/17/communities.archive\">The pick </a>of Loach\u2019s 1960s TV work, and not just for the galvanising effect it had on the then, and still, current concerns over homelessness. Carol White is tremendous as the mother who desperately tries to hang on to her children as her domestic situation becomes ever more precarious (husband injured at work, clashes with the in-laws, hard-hearted landlord). This is society as a slowly closing trap, with Loach accusatory towards the social workers and housing officers who are as cold as everyone else. The final scene, where Cathy\u2019s children are taken off her in a railway station, is horrible in its raw intensity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3fe9951636ac5a4b81d709ce5b3f50ad1e9152c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3fe9951636ac5a4b81d709ce5b3f50ad1e9152c2/0_2_4238_2543/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ray Brooks and Carol White in Cathy Come Home\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Caught in a trap: Ray Brooks and Carol White in Cathy Come Home.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Pickthorne/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>11. Sweet Sixteen (2002)</h2> <p>In the late 90s and early 00s, Scotland provided a rich seam of material for Loach and this one \u2013 nominally a teen movie \u2013 is one of the finest. Starring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/aug/26/martin-compston-soulboy\">Martin Compston</a> (another first-timer who, unlike most of Loach\u2019s discoveries, has gone on to enjoy a solid acting career), this is a rough, violent tale of a Greenock kid sucked, not entirely reluctantly, into the drug-dealing life. His naive dreams of escape soon evaporate: there is no going back.</p> <h2>10. It\u2019s a Free World \u2026 (2007)</h2> <p>Kierston Wareing made a real splash in this excellent and well-observed drama (like The Navigators, a TV premiere in the UK but a cinema release in other countries). And also like that film, Loach finds a new seam of material in the outsourced working world, where job security and back-up have melted away. Wareing is a new version of the hemmed-in Loach figure: a recruitment agent ruthless to those below, a victim of those above, with none of the security net of old-style employment. Loach\u2019s main target is the apparent freedom such conditions promise: the reality is very different.</p> <h2>9. Looks and Smiles (1981)</h2> <p>Loach was reportedly very disappointed by the box office failure of this Barry Hines adaptation, which motivated his return to TV in the ensuing decade. In retrospect, it is not hard to see why audiences avoided it: it is an incredibly gloomy black-and-white portrait of boredom and the Thatcherite recession. Looking at it now, it is an unexpectedly charming film: a study of a teenage relationship in adversity, staged with a total commitment to realism and awkwardness, and light years away from the John Hughes teen movies that would be coming down the pipe a few years later.</p> <h2>8. I, Daniel Blake (2016)</h2> <p>A monster success \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/22/ken-loach-cannes-2016-palme-dor-win-i-daniel-blake\">Cannes Palme d\u2019Or </a>and record box office \u2013 that must have come as a pleasant surprise. All Loach\u2019s characteristic ingredients are here: a fierce concentration on hot-button social issues (food banks and benefits assessment); preternaturally realistic performance; a standup comic (Dave Johns) doing his first bit of acting. Released in the year of the Brexit referendum, and surfing on the Momentum-inspired confidence of the anti-austerity left, the film unexpectedly hit a major nerve. If we are being absolutely honest, as a film it is solid if not spectacular (although the awful baked-beans scene is up there with Loach\u2019s most harrowing). In terms of impact, though, it is something else.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5058e984a8a8819f267004e34a87aaf5c4599753\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5058e984a8a8819f267004e34a87aaf5c4599753/0_57_1871_1123/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Mullan wields the paintbrush in My Name Is Joe\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peter Mullan wields the paintbrush in My Name Is Joe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Channel 4 Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>7. My Name Is Joe (1998)</h2> <p>Loach didn\u2019t exactly discover Peter Mullan, who had been bobbing about for years \u2013 and had even played one of the builders in Riff-Raff (<em>see below</em>) \u2013 but he gave him a tremendous showcase in what turned out to be the finest of Loach\u2019s Scotland-set films. Mullan plays the classic Loachian male: struggling with demons, hoping to be redeemed by love but dragged down by misplaced loyalties. It\u2019s Mullan\u2019s charisma that puts this one over the top, both ferocious and tender as the film requires it.</p> <h2>6. Sorry We Missed You (2019)</h2> <p>Loach\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/10/ken-loach-sorry-we-missed-you-interview-poverty-homelessness-inequality-privatisation\">new film</a>, his first since Blake, shows that he can pull off top-notch work as he heads into his 80s. As a subject, the gig economy appears to have only intensified the director\u2019s motivations and his principal character here, delivery driver Ricky (Kris Hitchen), exemplifies the new type of trapped victim: worker solidarity has been destroyed by zero-hours contracts, with devastating effects on Ricky\u2019s working and family life. It also contains one of Loach\u2019s most memorable bad-guy characters: self-proclaimed \u201cnasty bastard\u201d Maloney, the warehouse supervisor played by Ross Brewster.</p> <h2>5. Land and Freedom (1995)</h2> <p>Loach suddenly expanded his horizons in the mid-90s with this tribute to the foreign fighters who got involved in the Spanish civil war \u2013 another cause eternally dear to the left\u2019s heart. Ian Hart \u2013 who had just played John Lennon in Backbeat \u2013 turned in a fine performance as the Liverpudlian communist who travels out to join the struggle in the 1930s; like many a Loach protagonist before and since, supposed good guys (in this case, the Stalinist cadres of the International Brigades) are as bad as the official enemy. The script, by Jim Allen, posits the Trotskyist POUM militia as the real heroes. Rather brilliantly, Loach applied his ultra-realist style to the combat scenes, of house-to-house guerrilla warfare, with impressive results; they effectively balance out the longwinded scenes of political discussion.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b36a36d3f47c034c611dd6a242203067caf581ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b36a36d3f47c034c611dd6a242203067caf581ed/0_0_2230_1338/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Land and Freedom\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Land and Freedom: Loach\u2019s tribute to the International Brigade.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paralax Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>4. Poor Cow (1967)</h2> <p>After making a splash with his TV work, Loach was picked up by <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-joseph-janni-1419866.html\">Joseph Janni</a>, the celebrated producer of British new wave films such as Billy Liar, Darling and Far from the Madding Crowd. This was Loach\u2019s feature debut, and it imported all the strengths of his previous films: empathetic drama, brilliantly natural performances (including one from Terence Stamp, amazingly right at the height of his 60s stardom), and an audacious deployment of on-camera improvisation. This very much benefited from being more focused and less digressive than the TV plays, and its refusal to find neat narrative solutions pointed the way ahead for Loach\u2019s film work.</p> <h2>3. The Wind That Shakes the Barley (2006)</h2> <p>Loach\u2019s first Palme d\u2019Or went to this complex, large-scale film about the Irish state\u2019s birthing pains, spanning both the war of independence against the British and the subsequent civil war that followed it. Like Land and Freedom, this suggested that authentic radical values were destroyed, cynically, by revolutionaries-in-name-only: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/aug/08/cillian-murphy-peaky-blinders-james-bond-brexit\">Cillian Murphy</a>, as a socialist doctor and IRA soldier, is the vessel through which this conflict is explored \u2013 first fighting alongside, and then against, his brother Teddy. It is a thoroughly absorbing film, and very much not the propaganda piece one might expect (although, inevitably, the British, fuelled by their imperial arrogance, don\u2019t come out well).</p> <h2>2. Riff-Raff (1991)</h2> <p>Loach has always liked to make films about camaraderie: the literal representation of the class solidarity so central to his political thinking, and something in desperately short supply in the era of outsourcing and privatisation. Riff-Raff is arguably his finest treatment of the theme: the group of builders working on (symbolism alert!) a former hospital being turned into luxury flats. The lead actor is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/robert-carlyle\">Robert Carlyle</a>, in a career-making performance as Stevie: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/ricky-tomlinson\">Ricky Tomlinson</a> (former real-world union activist and long-term resident of Brookside) was a revelation as the effervescent socialist and site leader. Loach also contrived one of his most moving romances, between Stevie and <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0566659/\">Emer McCourt</a>\u2019s Susan, undone by drugs and difficult circumstances. It is perhaps not Loach\u2019s most hard-hitting film, but it is his most purely likable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ea018a3717175c18f718beff58d052c513959c62\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea018a3717175c18f718beff58d052c513959c62/0_99_2538_1523/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Bradley in Kes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Bradley in Kes: a miraculously brilliant performance.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ronald Grant Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>1. Kes (1969)</h2> <p>It may have spent decades in school-treat screening hell, but Kes\u2019s glories remain undimmed 50 years after it was first released. Adapted from Barry Hines\u2019s novel about a kid who becomes obsessed with looking after a bird of prey, it has got an obvious point of entry for school-age children \u2013 it is the ultimate misfit story \u2013 so its popularity as a classroom time-filler is understandable.</p> <p>As a parable of how individuality is squashed and warped \u2013 not only by the heartless teachers, but by Billy Casper\u2019s uncaring family \u2013 it is as heartrending as ever. Loach got one of his most miraculously brilliant performances in the central role from David \u201cDai\u201d Bradley; the raft of others on hand include Brian Glover as the bullying sports teacher and Colin Welland as the friendlier English teacher.</p> <p>What sets the film apart, though, is that Kes is Loach\u2019s most brilliant film cinematically: his and cinematographer Chris Menges\u2019s interest in the <a href=\"http://www.newwavefilm.com/international/czech-new-wave.shtml\">Czech new wave</a> found its expression in beautifully astute choices of shot and lighting, alternately amplifying the story\u2019s wit, cruelty and desperation. It may seem churlish to pick Loach\u2019s second feature as his best, but Kes has stood the test of time like no other, and will surely continue to do so.</p>",

      "bodyText": "37. 11\u201909\u201d01 September 11 (segment \u201cUnited Kingdom\u201d) (2002) Ken Loach\u2019s contribution to this short-film package of film-makers\u2019 responses to 9/11 is a perfectly serviceable account of a different September 11: an activist\u2019s letter to America about the coup against President Salvador Allende in Chile in 1973. At the time it seemed jarring, and in retrospect very much not what was needed; but it\u2019s not the worst of the bunch \u2013 Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu gets nul points for incorporating footage of people jumping from the collapsing World Trade Center in a sound/image collage. 36. The End of Arthur\u2019s Marriage (1965) A somewhat supercilious satire on the property-owning middle classes that Loach later admitted he was the wrong director for: a little bit Fassbinder, a little bit Gurney Slade. It played into Loach\u2019s favourite theme \u2013 the little man against the system \u2013 but the director\u2019s instincts are not best served by wackiness. A shame, as it throws away a great lead performance by Ken Jones, a regular Loach collaborator, and later immortalised as the prison snitch Ives in Porridge. 35. Fatherland (1986) Not an adaptation of the Robert Harris alternative-history novel, but a patchy account of an East German musician as unhappy under communism as he is in the west. This is Loach\u2019s signature theme \u2013 systems and authority of any kind are open to abuse \u2013 but he is never at his best with non-English-speaking characters and this film (almost entirely in German) is not exactly a triumph. 34. Tickets (2005) Another package film, with Loach directing the final third after chunks from Ermanno Olmi (The Tree of Wooden Clogs) and Abbas Kiarostami. It\u2019s a clever idea \u2013 train tickets as a symbol for wider social permissions \u2013 and Loach\u2019s bit is nice but slight, with a bunch of Celtic fans squabbling among themselves whether to help an Albanian migrant family. 33. Three Clear Sundays (1965) The earliest of Loach\u2019s Wednesday Plays to survive shows his early style in full flow. A talky, digressive piece, this anti-death penalty broadside is infused with a jittery hyperactive energy as Loach sought to overcome the staid traditions of television drama. It\u2019s a bit on the stagey side, with lots of cockney chat, but the final execution scene, when poor Tony Selby is strung up for killing a prison officer, still packs a hell of a punch. 32. The Golden Vision (1968) Loach may not be an obvious football man, but it\u2019s a thread that runs through his work. This innovative mix of drama and documentary pleasingly focuses on a cult figure from Everton\u2019s mid-60s cup-winning side: the Scottish midfielder Alex Young. Loach (as ever) is more interested in the fans and how football folds into their lives (more good work from Ken Jones), with real-life footage of Everton personnel (including Young) talking to camera about their lives. In truth, it doesn\u2019t amount to all that much, but texturally it\u2019s still pretty interesting. 31. The Big Flame (1969) Loach really nailed his political colours to the mast with this script by the Trotskyist former docker Jim Allen, and in doing so proved that the intricacies of an industrial dispute could be material for compelling, if not exactly exhilarating, drama. Nevertheless, this was evidence that Loach had achieved what he had clearly been aiming at for some time: acting so planed down it was indistinguishable from reality. 30. Carla\u2019s Song (1996) You can see the attraction of the Nicaraguan civil war: one of the great international causes of the 80s. The involvement of Robert Carlyle, fresh from Trainspotting, gave this film a shot in the arm, although the somewhat saucer-eyed approach to the Latin characters \u2013 particularly Carla herself, with whose exotic mystery Carlyle\u2019s bus driver falls in love \u2013 doesn\u2019t do the film many favours. 29. Jimmy\u2019s Hall (2014) An uncomplicated, comfort-zone paean to the Irish communist Jimmy Gralton, whose brand of free-thinking is too much for the local worthies in 1930s Ireland. There\u2019s not much light and shade here: Gralton (Barry Ward) is your standard crinkle-eyed nice-guy, a sacrificial lamb to the republic\u2019s new intolerance. 28. The Rank and File (1971) Loach\u2019s mature, unadorned style emerged with this account of a labour dispute in north-west England, a BBC Play for Today that is essentially a lightly fictionalised treatment of the 1970 Pilkington glass strike. It recreates the smoke-filled rooms and committee discussions, establishing that the unions and management are both conspiring to shore up a system that keeps the ordinary workers in their place. Compared to The Big Flame, which covers not dissimilar ground, this is a sober, unblinking treatment, eliminating the flourishes of his 60s work. Heavy-duty stuff. 27. In Two Minds (1967) While there is something fundamentally naive in this film\u2019s analysis of mental illness \u2013 merging RD Laing\u2019s anti-organic thesis with his own politics, Loach aims to pin responsibility for its subject\u2019s schizophrenia on \u201csocial conditions\u201d, namely, Kate\u2019s poor relationship with her mother \u2013 this is high-achieving formally. Formatted as a documentary, with a stream of \u201cinterviews\u201d and voiceover, this is fiction disguised very convincingly as fact. Unusually, Loach slips into point-of-view as the final ECT scenes approach. 26. Looking for Eric (2009) This one is a bit of an outrider. Loach scored something of a coup by casting the Manchester United legend Eric Cantona as a sort of Play It Again, Sam-style dope-fuelled fantasy adviser to a harassed Mancunian postman. It\u2019s got its strong points, but the required wackiness isn\u2019t always there. 25. Route Irish (2010) Named after the road into Baghdad airport, Loach\u2019s assault on the west\u2019s murky activities in Iraq focuses on the outsourcing of fighting and the subsequent corporate cover-up. It is one of his more conventional-looking films, and takes on a big target \u2013 possibly too big for the scale of film Loach is able to mount. 24. Family Life (1971) A remake/reworking of In Two Minds, framed as a more traditional dramatic narrative and with the central character\u2019s troubled mindset more obviously triggered by the generation gap and the abortion she was made to have. Although this film follows a similar trajectory, finding environmental and social causes for her erratic behaviour, leading to seemingly brutal ECT treatment, Loach wisely retreats a little from the wider mental-illness thesis of the original. 23. The Angels\u2019 Share (2012) A lightweight entry in Loach\u2019s Scottish cycle: a violent tearaway (played by Paul Brannigan) resolves to get out of the Glasgow gang life by stealing some valuable whisky. This actually has a happy ending (of sorts), but Loach doesn\u2019t quite succeed in making a basically vicious central character likable. 22. Ae Fond Kiss \u2026 (2004) This film contains one of the few non-white lead characters in Loach\u2019s work: Casim, son of Pakistani immigrants, who embarks on a forbidden relationship with Catholic school teacher Roisin. Loach\u2019s target, as ever, is the system of control that prevents ordinary people from achieving freedom in their lives; this inter-ethnic romance does a decent job in exploring religion and immigrant culture, but it isn\u2019t Loach\u2019s natural habitat. 21. Raining Stones (1993) A likable comedy from Loach\u2019s early-90s resurgence, working from a Jim Allen script about an on-his-uppers chancer trying to scrape together enough money for a communion dress for his daughter. It\u2019s not one of his most resonant films, but is basically good natured and an excellent example of the director\u2019s unerring ability to get great performances from first-timers: the lead is Bruce Jones, who was a club-circuit comic at the time. 20. Ladybird, Ladybird (1994) Another great spot from Loach: Crissy Rock, another former club comic, is tremendous as self-destructive mum Maggie, who has lost four of her children to social services after a string of disastrous relationships. Loach, characteristically, is doing his utmost to extract sympathy for one of life\u2019s casualties; there is little sympathy to spare for the council workers trying to deal with her. 19. Up the Junction (1965) In its day, this adaptation of Nell Dunn\u2019s stories for the Wednesday Play spot was notorious for its agonised abortion/miscarriage sequence; but there\u2019s more to this than outrage. Like its predecessor Three Clear Sundays, this is a rangy, digressive portrait of street life; here it is about three young women working in a wash-house in Battersea and is a depiction of a marginalised, under-represented community that hums with life. The abortion itself is interestingly consequence-free; the three leads (who include Carol White in her first Loach role) are all great. 18. Black Jack (1979) One of Loach\u2019s few attempts to make a putatively commercial \u201cfamily film\u201d: this is adapted from Leon Garfield\u2019s book about a kid in the 18th century who falls in with an itinerant, hulking villain (the Black Jack of the title), rescues a girl who has been sent to the madhouse and works for a funfair. It is unusual, interesting material for a children\u2019s film, even by 70s standards, but the flat, ultra-naturalistic acting style Loach employed works against the extravagant storyline: the whole thing could have been a bit more rollicking. 17. Bread and Roses (2000) Loach held his nose and went to the US to make this statement-film about exploitation of immigrant workers in Los Angeles. It stars Adrien Brody as a union organiser who (wouldn\u2019t you know it?) falls in love with one of the women he is defending. Even so, Loach lands some telling sledgehammer blows, even if \u2013 outside his UK and Ireland comfort zone \u2013 much of his customary nuance is absent. 16. The Spirit of 45 (2013) In retrospect, this looks like an early emanation of the nostalgia-socialism that helped pave the way for Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour leadership triumph two years later. A compendium of interviews of warhorse campaigners and archive-clip history about Clement Attlee\u2019s landslide victory in 1945, this is just about the only Loach documentary expressly aimed at the cinema. Although its contemporary political purpose is rather over-evident, it is still a stirring vision of what used to be, and what many hoped could be again. 15. Hidden Agenda (1990) A conspiracy thriller that marked Loach\u2019s return to feature film-making after a difficult 1980s spent trying (and often failing) to get his TV projects broadcast. As with the later Route Irish, Loach goes for a relatively mainstream style to tell an incendiary political story: here it is about British military collusion in the murder of a human rights lawyer (clearly related to the real-life killing of Pat Finucane). It is a bit by-the-numbers stylewise, but it re-established Loach as a radical force. 14. The Gamekeeper (1980) A feature-length drama made for ITV, adapted from a Barry Hines novel, and about as pared-down a piece as Loach is ever likely to make. Phil Askham is the eponymous estate worker, caught between competing loyalties and as out of place down the pub with the poacher-forgiving locals as with the capped-and-Barboured shooting gentry. There is no plot to speak of: just an incremental progression of incident (some, like rabbit hunting with ferrets, looks pretty gruesome for modern sensibilities), but it\u2019s remarkable all the same: a working life in collision with muddy, bloody nature. 13. The Navigators (2001) Unusually, this full-length feature had its UK premiere on TV; perhaps reflecting the popular nature of its subject: rail privatisation. Loach has always admired \u201crailwaymen\u201d for their tight organisation and solidarity: he clearly enjoyed bringing out their camaraderie in an appealing film that had self-evident real-world parallels. Staffed with the customary lineup of club comics and singers turned actors, this is Loach in confident, mid-season form. 12. Cathy Come Home (1966) The pick of Loach\u2019s 1960s TV work, and not just for the galvanising effect it had on the then, and still, current concerns over homelessness. Carol White is tremendous as the mother who desperately tries to hang on to her children as her domestic situation becomes ever more precarious (husband injured at work, clashes with the in-laws, hard-hearted landlord). This is society as a slowly closing trap, with Loach accusatory towards the social workers and housing officers who are as cold as everyone else. The final scene, where Cathy\u2019s children are taken off her in a railway station, is horrible in its raw intensity. 11. Sweet Sixteen (2002) In the late 90s and early 00s, Scotland provided a rich seam of material for Loach and this one \u2013 nominally a teen movie \u2013 is one of the finest. Starring Martin Compston (another first-timer who, unlike most of Loach\u2019s discoveries, has gone on to enjoy a solid acting career), this is a rough, violent tale of a Greenock kid sucked, not entirely reluctantly, into the drug-dealing life. His naive dreams of escape soon evaporate: there is no going back. 10. It\u2019s a Free World \u2026 (2007) Kierston Wareing made a real splash in this excellent and well-observed drama (like The Navigators, a TV premiere in the UK but a cinema release in other countries). And also like that film, Loach finds a new seam of material in the outsourced working world, where job security and back-up have melted away. Wareing is a new version of the hemmed-in Loach figure: a recruitment agent ruthless to those below, a victim of those above, with none of the security net of old-style employment. Loach\u2019s main target is the apparent freedom such conditions promise: the reality is very different. 9. Looks and Smiles (1981) Loach was reportedly very disappointed by the box office failure of this Barry Hines adaptation, which motivated his return to TV in the ensuing decade. In retrospect, it is not hard to see why audiences avoided it: it is an incredibly gloomy black-and-white portrait of boredom and the Thatcherite recession. Looking at it now, it is an unexpectedly charming film: a study of a teenage relationship in adversity, staged with a total commitment to realism and awkwardness, and light years away from the John Hughes teen movies that would be coming down the pipe a few years later. 8. I, Daniel Blake (2016) A monster success \u2013 the Cannes Palme d\u2019Or and record box office \u2013 that must have come as a pleasant surprise. All Loach\u2019s characteristic ingredients are here: a fierce concentration on hot-button social issues (food banks and benefits assessment); preternaturally realistic performance; a standup comic (Dave Johns) doing his first bit of acting. Released in the year of the Brexit referendum, and surfing on the Momentum-inspired confidence of the anti-austerity left, the film unexpectedly hit a major nerve. If we are being absolutely honest, as a film it is solid if not spectacular (although the awful baked-beans scene is up there with Loach\u2019s most harrowing). In terms of impact, though, it is something else. 7. My Name Is Joe (1998) Loach didn\u2019t exactly discover Peter Mullan, who had been bobbing about for years \u2013 and had even played one of the builders in Riff-Raff (see below) \u2013 but he gave him a tremendous showcase in what turned out to be the finest of Loach\u2019s Scotland-set films. Mullan plays the classic Loachian male: struggling with demons, hoping to be redeemed by love but dragged down by misplaced loyalties. It\u2019s Mullan\u2019s charisma that puts this one over the top, both ferocious and tender as the film requires it. 6. Sorry We Missed You (2019) Loach\u2019s new film, his first since Blake, shows that he can pull off top-notch work as he heads into his 80s. As a subject, the gig economy appears to have only intensified the director\u2019s motivations and his principal character here, delivery driver Ricky (Kris Hitchen), exemplifies the new type of trapped victim: worker solidarity has been destroyed by zero-hours contracts, with devastating effects on Ricky\u2019s working and family life. It also contains one of Loach\u2019s most memorable bad-guy characters: self-proclaimed \u201cnasty bastard\u201d Maloney, the warehouse supervisor played by Ross Brewster. 5. Land and Freedom (1995) Loach suddenly expanded his horizons in the mid-90s with this tribute to the foreign fighters who got involved in the Spanish civil war \u2013 another cause eternally dear to the left\u2019s heart. Ian Hart \u2013 who had just played John Lennon in Backbeat \u2013 turned in a fine performance as the Liverpudlian communist who travels out to join the struggle in the 1930s; like many a Loach protagonist before and since, supposed good guys (in this case, the Stalinist cadres of the International Brigades) are as bad as the official enemy. The script, by Jim Allen, posits the Trotskyist POUM militia as the real heroes. Rather brilliantly, Loach applied his ultra-realist style to the combat scenes, of house-to-house guerrilla warfare, with impressive results; they effectively balance out the longwinded scenes of political discussion. 4. Poor Cow (1967) After making a splash with his TV work, Loach was picked up by Joseph Janni, the celebrated producer of British new wave films such as Billy Liar, Darling and Far from the Madding Crowd. This was Loach\u2019s feature debut, and it imported all the strengths of his previous films: empathetic drama, brilliantly natural performances (including one from Terence Stamp, amazingly right at the height of his 60s stardom), and an audacious deployment of on-camera improvisation. This very much benefited from being more focused and less digressive than the TV plays, and its refusal to find neat narrative solutions pointed the way ahead for Loach\u2019s film work. 3. The Wind That Shakes the Barley (2006) Loach\u2019s first Palme d\u2019Or went to this complex, large-scale film about the Irish state\u2019s birthing pains, spanning both the war of independence against the British and the subsequent civil war that followed it. Like Land and Freedom, this suggested that authentic radical values were destroyed, cynically, by revolutionaries-in-name-only: Cillian Murphy, as a socialist doctor and IRA soldier, is the vessel through which this conflict is explored \u2013 first fighting alongside, and then against, his brother Teddy. It is a thoroughly absorbing film, and very much not the propaganda piece one might expect (although, inevitably, the British, fuelled by their imperial arrogance, don\u2019t come out well). 2. Riff-Raff (1991) Loach has always liked to make films about camaraderie: the literal representation of the class solidarity so central to his political thinking, and something in desperately short supply in the era of outsourcing and privatisation. Riff-Raff is arguably his finest treatment of the theme: the group of builders working on (symbolism alert!) a former hospital being turned into luxury flats. The lead actor is Robert Carlyle, in a career-making performance as Stevie: Ricky Tomlinson (former real-world union activist and long-term resident of Brookside) was a revelation as the effervescent socialist and site leader. Loach also contrived one of his most moving romances, between Stevie and Emer McCourt\u2019s Susan, undone by drugs and difficult circumstances. It is perhaps not Loach\u2019s most hard-hitting film, but it is his most purely likable. 1. Kes (1969) It may have spent decades in school-treat screening hell, but Kes\u2019s glories remain undimmed 50 years after it was first released. Adapted from Barry Hines\u2019s novel about a kid who becomes obsessed with looking after a bird of prey, it has got an obvious point of entry for school-age children \u2013 it is the ultimate misfit story \u2013 so its popularity as a classroom time-filler is understandable. As a parable of how individuality is squashed and warped \u2013 not only by the heartless teachers, but by Billy Casper\u2019s uncaring family \u2013 it is as heartrending as ever. Loach got one of his most miraculously brilliant performances in the central role from David \u201cDai\u201d Bradley; the raft of others on hand include Brian Glover as the bullying sports teacher and Colin Welland as the friendlier English teacher. What sets the film apart, though, is that Kes is Loach\u2019s most brilliant film cinematically: his and cinematographer Chris Menges\u2019s interest in the Czech new wave found its expression in beautifully astute choices of shot and lighting, alternately amplifying the story\u2019s wit, cruelty and desperation. It may seem churlish to pick Loach\u2019s second feature as his best, but Kes has stood the test of time like no other, and will surely continue to do so.",

      "body": "<p>The police watchdog has found no misconduct from Essex police in a case where a woman died after being stabbed more than a hundred times by her mentally ill partner and officers took almost three hours to respond to a 999 call.</p> <p>The attacker\u2019s parents, who made the call but were unable to go to the scene because they were overseas, expressed dismay at the ruling.</p> <p>The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said the response was delayed for such a long time because the call had been wrongly categorised by the initial handler.</p> <p>In January, a jury at Chelmsford crown court found Jake Neate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jan/18/man-given-hospital-order-for-stabbing-girlfriend-173-times\">killed his girlfriend</a>, Suzanne Brown, 33, by stabbing her 173 times at the couple\u2019s home in Braintree, Essex on 15 December 2017.</p> <p>The findings followed a trial of the facts because Neate, who has schizophrenia, was deemed unfit to stand trial. The court heard Essex police officers arrived at the property almost three hours after Neate\u2019s mother, Jan Neate, had first called them. By that time, it was too late to save Brown. The attack began on the evening of 15 December. Brown died in the early hours of the following day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fe3011f978452d60c11f0b8ebcd6c7249a7c700b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe3011f978452d60c11f0b8ebcd6c7249a7c700b/0_38_640_384/500.jpg\" alt=\"Jake Neate\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jake Neate.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Family handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Brown raised the alarm by calling Jan Neate in a distressed state when Jake Neate, who had never been violent before, began to attack her. Jan Neate then made an emergency call to Essex police. Questions have been raised about whether Brown would have survived had police arrived at the couple\u2019s address soon after they received the call at about 9.30pm.</p> <p>Jan and her husband, John Neate, had recently retired to Spain so were not able to quickly go to the couple\u2019s home.</p> <p>Jan and John Neate made complaints to the IOPC about procedures of emergency call handlers in the control room and the delay in police officers arriving.</p> <p>They said they were \u201cvery disappointed\u201d with the IOPC\u2019s report. Two members of staff in the control room have received management action and a member of police staff from the control room has also received management action in relation to asking sufficiently probing questions.</p> <p>The IOPC has asked Essex police to make call handling improvements. The watchdog said control room staff should be notified when emergency calls go past their target response times and it has asked police to provide callers with an assigned grading and estimated attendance time to urgent incidents, in line with national guidance.</p> <p>The IOPC regional director Sarah Green said: \u201cOur investigation found that the initial call to the force control room had not been categorised correctly as a domestic incident. This meant associated processes, including risk questions being asked that may have aided the response, were not triggered.\u201d</p> <p>Jake Neate was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia at the age of 20 while studying geography at Birmingham University. He began taking antipsychotic medicine and in his mid-20s was prescribed clozapine, which he responded well to. He had neither a history of violence nor a criminal record.</p> <p>When Neate\u2019s parents left the UK to settle in Spain a few months before the killing, things seemed to be going well for their son and his girlfriend. They had been living happily together for 10 years and were thrilled to have recently moved into a flat of their own.</p> <p>Deborah Coles, the director of Inquest, which is providing support to Jan and John Neate, said: \u201cThis case once again highlights failures of the police to respond effectively to serious concerns raised about the risk to life of a young woman as a result of her partner\u2019s serious mental ill health.</p> <p>\u201cIt is difficult to reconcile the weak outcome of this investigation given the complacent response to a series of emergency calls.

      "bodyText": "The police watchdog has found no misconduct from Essex police in a case where a woman died after being stabbed more than a hundred times by her mentally ill partner and officers took almost three hours to respond to a 999 call. The attacker\u2019s parents, who made the call but were unable to go to the scene because they were overseas, expressed dismay at the ruling. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said the response was delayed for such a long time because the call had been wrongly categorised by the initial handler. In January, a jury at Chelmsford crown court found Jake Neate killed his girlfriend, Suzanne Brown, 33, by stabbing her 173 times at the couple\u2019s home in Braintree, Essex on 15 December 2017. The findings followed a trial of the facts because Neate, who has schizophrenia, was deemed unfit to stand trial. The court heard Essex police officers arrived at the property almost three hours after Neate\u2019s mother, Jan Neate, had first called them. By that time, it was too late to save Brown. The attack began on the evening of 15 December. Brown died in the early hours of the following day. Brown raised the alarm by calling Jan Neate in a distressed state when Jake Neate, who had never been violent before, began to attack her. Jan Neate then made an emergency call to Essex police. Questions have been raised about whether Brown would have survived had police arrived at the couple\u2019s address soon after they received the call at about 9.30pm. Jan and her husband, John Neate, had recently retired to Spain so were not able to quickly go to the couple\u2019s home. Jan and John Neate made complaints to the IOPC about procedures of emergency call handlers in the control room and the delay in police officers arriving. They said they were \u201cvery disappointed\u201d with the IOPC\u2019s report. Two members of staff in the control room have received management action and a member of police staff from the control room has also received management action in relation to asking sufficiently probing questions. The IOPC has asked Essex police to make call handling improvements. The watchdog said control room staff should be notified when emergency calls go past their target response times and it has asked police to provide callers with an assigned grading and estimated attendance time to urgent incidents, in line with national guidance. The IOPC regional director Sarah Green said: \u201cOur investigation found that the initial call to the force control room had not been categorised correctly as a domestic incident. This meant associated processes, including risk questions being asked that may have aided the response, were not triggered.\u201d Jake Neate was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia at the age of 20 while studying geography at Birmingham University. He began taking antipsychotic medicine and in his mid-20s was prescribed clozapine, which he responded well to. He had neither a history of violence nor a criminal record. When Neate\u2019s parents left the UK to settle in Spain a few months before the killing, things seemed to be going well for their son and his girlfriend. They had been living happily together for 10 years and were thrilled to have recently moved into a flat of their own. Deborah Coles, the director of Inquest, which is providing support to Jan and John Neate, said: \u201cThis case once again highlights failures of the police to respond effectively to serious concerns raised about the risk to life of a young woman as a result of her partner\u2019s serious mental ill health. \u201cIt is difficult to reconcile the weak outcome of this investigation given the complacent response to a series of emergency calls. It is vital that the inquest scrutinises the actions and inactions of mental health services and the police, and whether Suzanne\u2019s death should have been prevented.\u201d Jan Neate said: \u201cTwo families\u2019 lives are totally ruined by what has happened \u2013 a beautiful girl who we loved has lost her life and our family life is gone for ever. We are heartbroken. All we have left is to continue fighting to prevent these tragic circumstances from ever happening again.\u201d Jake Neate has been given an indefinite hospital order. The Essex partnership university NHS foundation trust, which was responsible for Neate\u2019s care, is investigating the case. A domestic homicide review and an inquiry by NHS England are also under way. An inquest into Brown\u2019s death will be held next March. Essex police declined to comment on the IOPC findings.",

He praised campaigners outside court for their persistent action over many years.</p> <p>Friends of the Earth is leading the legal challenges on climate grounds against the third runway, which was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/25/boris-johnson-criticised-over-decision-to-miss-crunch-heathrow-expansion-vote\">approved by </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/25/boris-johnson-criticised-over-decision-to-miss-crunch-heathrow-expansion-vote\">parliament</a> last year. The court of appeal is hearing five days of challenges against the expansion, which will put 700 more planes into the air each day.</p> <p>Opening the appeal, Lord Justice Lindblom said the hearing would raise matters of obvious importance, which would be of interest to a national and international audience.</p> <p>Government lawyers will argue the runway can be built without breaching the country\u2019s climate commitment, according to documents submitted to the court.</p> <p>The high court <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/01/high-court-dismisses-attempt-to-block-third-heathrow-runway\">ruled in May</a> that the government\u2019s decision to allow a third runway was lawful. The court of appeal is hearing challenges against this decision from parties including environmental NGOs, five local authorities, the London mayor and Greenpeace.</p> <p>David Wolfe QC, for Friends of the Earth, told the court the then transport secretary, Chris Grayling, had not taken the 2015 Paris agreement into account when approving the airport expansion.</p> <p>Instead, Grayling limited his consideration of the climate crisis to whether the runway could be made to fit within the existing legal carbon targets of an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas levels by 2050. This would require all other sectors to reduce their emissions by 85%.</p> <p>Wolfe said these targets had now risen to a 100% reduction in greenhouse gas levels by 2050 following an amendment to the Climate Change Act this summer, giving further weight to the argument that the expansion goes against the government\u2019s climate goals.</p> <p>The Committee on Climate Change, the government\u2019s statutory advisor, has warned ministers that aviation will be the biggest source of emissions in the UK by then.</p> <p>Wolfe said the transport secretary should have taken into account the Paris agreement as well as planet-warming gases linked to aviation. \u201cNo one can be unaware of the urgent need to tackle climate change,\u201d he said.</p> <p>For the first time, judges will hear arguments that the expansion of Heathrow airport <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/17/heathrow-expansion-violates-climate-rights-children-court-appeal-third-runway\">violates the rights</a> of children and future generations, who will bear the greatest impact of the climate crisis. World Wide Fund for Nature was given permission to submit papers alleging a breach of the UN convention on the rights of the child to the court.</p> <p>Willie Walsh, the chief executive of International Airlines Group, which owns British Airways, told a press conference in Toronto this week he believed the \u00a314bn runway was unlikely to go ahead because of a growing backlash over the environment.</p> <p>\u201cI think it is a bigger challenge today than it was a year ago. And I can\u2019t see it getting any easier,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Walsh has been a longtime critic of the cost of the expansion. Critics say the \u00a314bn price tag will balloon to more than \u00a330bn. The two-mile runway will involve the creation of one of the world\u2019s biggest car parks, with capacity for nearly 50,000 vehicles, the reclamation of 385 hectares (950 acres) of land and the demolition of 761 homes. Part of the M25 will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jun/18/heathrow-third-runway-expansion-plans-revealed\">need to be moved</a> as part of the plan.</p> <p>A coalition of local authorities \u2013 Wandsworth, Richmond upon Thames, Hillingdon, Hammersmith and Fulham and the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead \u2013 along with the mayor of London and Greenpeace, will argue the expansion was flawed because ministers failed to properly consider the full impact of noise levels, health and the environment.</p> <p>Heathrow said in its consultation documents that expansion should not come at any cost. The airport has outlined plans for low-emissions zones and congestion charges to stem local air pollution.</p> <p>Boris Johnson, who once <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/01/boris-johnson-heathrow-third-runway-davies-report\">threatened to lie down</a> in front of the bulldozers to prevent the expansion, has said he will watch the legal challenges with lively interest.</p> <p>A decision is expected in December.</p>",

The court of appeal is hearing five days of challenges against the expansion, which will put 700 more planes into the air each day. Opening the appeal, Lord Justice Lindblom said the hearing would raise matters of obvious importance, which would be of interest to a national and international audience. Government lawyers will argue the runway can be built without breaching the country\u2019s climate commitment, according to documents submitted to the court. The high court ruled in May that the government\u2019s decision to allow a third runway was lawful. The court of appeal is hearing challenges against this decision from parties including environmental NGOs, five local authorities, the London mayor and Greenpeace. David Wolfe QC, for Friends of the Earth, told the court the then transport secretary, Chris Grayling, had not taken the 2015 Paris agreement into account when approving the airport expansion. Instead, Grayling limited his consideration of the climate crisis to whether the runway could be made to fit within the existing legal carbon targets of an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas levels by 2050. This would require all other sectors to reduce their emissions by 85%. Wolfe said these targets had now risen to a 100% reduction in greenhouse gas levels by 2050 following an amendment to the Climate Change Act this summer, giving further weight to the argument that the expansion goes against the government\u2019s climate goals. The Committee on Climate Change, the government\u2019s statutory advisor, has warned ministers that aviation will be the biggest source of emissions in the UK by then. Wolfe said the transport secretary should have taken into account the Paris agreement as well as planet-warming gases linked to aviation. \u201cNo one can be unaware of the urgent need to tackle climate change,\u201d he said. For the first time, judges will hear arguments that the expansion of Heathrow airport violates the rights of children and future generations, who will bear the greatest impact of the climate crisis. World Wide Fund for Nature was given permission to submit papers alleging a breach of the UN convention on the rights of the child to the court. Willie Walsh, the chief executive of International Airlines Group, which owns British Airways, told a press conference in Toronto this week he believed the \u00a314bn runway was unlikely to go ahead because of a growing backlash over the environment. \u201cI think it is a bigger challenge today than it was a year ago. And I can\u2019t see it getting any easier,\u201d he said. Walsh has been a longtime critic of the cost of the expansion. Critics say the \u00a314bn price tag will balloon to more than \u00a330bn. The two-mile runway will involve the creation of one of the world\u2019s biggest car parks, with capacity for nearly 50,000 vehicles, the reclamation of 385 hectares (950 acres) of land and the demolition of 761 homes. Part of the M25 will need to be moved as part of the plan. A coalition of local authorities \u2013 Wandsworth, Richmond upon Thames, Hillingdon, Hammersmith and Fulham and the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead \u2013 along with the mayor of London and Greenpeace, will argue the expansion was flawed because ministers failed to properly consider the full impact of noise levels, health and the environment. Heathrow said in its consultation documents that expansion should not come at any cost. The airport has outlined plans for low-emissions zones and congestion charges to stem local air pollution. Boris Johnson, who once threatened to lie down in front of the bulldozers to prevent the expansion, has said he will watch the legal challenges with lively interest. A decision is expected in December.",

The writer had a complex relationship with the country, which in effect banned Ulysses over its \u201cobscene\u201d and \u201canti-Irish\u201d content. He \u201cdecries Irish society\u2019s conservatism, pietism and blinkered nationalism\u201d in his writing, according to an essay from the Irish Emigration Museum curator Jessica Traynor. One of the characters in his novel A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man describes Ireland as \u201cthe old sow that eats her farrow\u201d. Although Joyce \u201ccouldn\u2019t bear to live in Dublin\u201d, Traynor continues, his \u201cspiritual and artistic engagement with the city continued until the end of his life\u201d. When he lived in Paris, his \u201cfavourite pastime was to seek out visitors from Dublin and ask them to recount the names of the shops and pubs from Amiens Street to Nelson\u2019s Column on O\u2019Connell Street\u201d. When Joyce died aged 58 after undergoing surgery on a perforated ulcer, Ireland\u2019s secretary of external affairs sent the order: \u201cPlease wire details about Joyce\u2019s death. If possible find out if he died a Catholic.\u201d Neither of the two Irish diplomats in Switzerland at the time attended his funeral, and the Irish government later denied Barnacle\u2019s request to repatriate his remains. If the Dublin city councillors\u2019 motion is passed, the next step will be to ask the Irish government to request the remains be returned before the centenary celebrations around the publication of Ulysses in 2022. A spokeswoman for culture minister Josepha Madigan told theJournal.ie it was \u201ca matter in the first instance for family members and/or the trustees of the Joyce estate\u201d. \u201cWithout having received an application from those it would not be appropriate for the minister to express a view on the matter,\u201d she added. Senn predicted that Joyce\u2019s grandson, Stephen Joyce, who has guarded his grandfather\u2019s legacy closely over the years, would be unlikely to back the motion. \u201cEverything depends on his vote \u2013 negative, most likely,\u201d said Senn. Attempts to reach Stephen Joyce were unsuccessful. Despite the intensifying row, Senn declared he would not fight to keep Joyce in Switzerland: \u201cI myself am not nationalistic enough to mount the barricades for a body.\u201d",

Ivor Bell, a veteran republican, was cleared of soliciting the murder of Jean McConville in 1972. McConville became known as one of the \u201cdisappeared\u201d of the Northern Ireland Troubles. The prosecution\u2019s case against 82-year-old Bell, from west Belfast, was based on alleged admissions he gave to the Boston College/Belfast Project tapes, an archive of taped testimonies from IRA and loyalist paramilitaries who admitted their part in terrorist crimes including murder during the Troubles.

The restrictions had prevented the Guardian from revealing earlier this year that a key American academic could no longer testify in the Bell trial and other upcoming cases connected to the Boston College tapes. The Guardian obtained legal documents showing that the head of the US university library where the tapes of self-confessed IRA and UVF activists were held had won the right to withdraw from criminal cases relating to the oral history programme. Legal sources and campaigners on both sides of the Atlantic claimed the withdrawal on health grounds of Bob O\u2019Neill would potentially collapse some of these cases.

From his last posting in Bonn he was sent to cover the civil war in Lebanon twice. On most if not all of these jobs Bob was accompanied by a film crew sent from somewhere else. Somewhere else was where Bob found himself on all three occasions when his wife, Eve, gave birth to their children in three different capitals. His recruitment to the European commission in 1977 brought a greater degree of stability; there was plenty of travel but it was all marked in advance on the kitchen calendar. He always remained congenial, warm-hearted and fun. He is survived by Eve (nee Blake), whom he married in 1957, and their children, Sarah, Charles and Amelia, and six grandchildren, Alexander, Freddie, Max, Amelia, Jasmine and Thea.",

      "body": "<p>\u2018I\u2019m the kind of person who loves to be in a crowd and not get noticed,\u201d says Eddie Holland, calling from a golf course in Los Angeles, where he is playing with his brother, Brian. Together with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/aug/26/lamont-dozier-the-songs-just-kept-coming\" title=\"\">Lamont Dozier</a>, the Hollands formed the legendary Holland-Dozier-Holland (HDH), the crack songwriting-production team whose songs for the likes of the Supremes, Martha and the Vandellas, the Temptations and Marvin Gaye made them, in Stevie Wonder\u2019s words, \u201cthe foundations of Motown\u201d.</p> <p>They went mostly unnoticed compared with the stars, but seven years ago, a church minister convinced the siblings that, now they were in their 70s, it was time to tell their story. \u201cHe told me: \u2018If you don\u2019t write a book, someone else will, and they\u2019re not going to write what you want them to,\u2019\u201d Eddie, 79, says. Thus, the Hollands have penned a revealing autobiography. Named after a song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJS_Oey8PqU\" title=\"\">they wrote for the Vandellas</a>, <a href=\"https://www.soul-source.co.uk/articles/news-soul/new-holland-dozier-holland-book-come-get-these-memories-motown-r4090/\" title=\"\">Come and Get These Memories</a> shows how so much era-defining pop music came out of Motown boss Berry Gordy\u2019s small house and studios on 2648 West Grand Boulevard in Detroit.</p> <p>\u201cIf we\u2019d been in New York, we\u2019d have had all these places to go,\u201d Eddie muses. \u201cBut in Detroit there wasn\u2019t anywhere, so we ended up at Motown. It was our club. People could converse, play cards, but Brian and I had our own office because Berry didn\u2019t want anything getting in the way of those hits.\u201d Thirteen of them reached No 1 in the US, and many more remain radio and wedding-disco staples. Brian, 78, admits they never expected such longevity. \u201cAs we\u2019ve got older, it feels like it was a miracle.\u201d Here, they talk through some of those imperishable tunes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f8b282a62c327d5f531b5692360dc302528fa297\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8b282a62c327d5f531b5692360dc302528fa297/0_703_2902_2297/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Martha and the Vandellas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"792\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Martha and the Vandellas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k0GDQrK2jo\" title=\"\"><strong>Martha and the Vandellas \u2013 Heat Wave (1963)</strong></a></h2> <p>When Brian was eight years old, the Ford Motor Company put on orchestral concerts and invited local kids. \u201cI was greatly impressed by all the violins and bassoons,\u201d he remembers. \u201cIt was like being taken out of myself.\u201d Eddie recognised his brother\u2019s ear for melody and the pair sang around the house. As teenagers, they came to the attention of Gordy, who had founded Tamla Records in 1959 and sister label Motown Records (short for \u201cmotor town\u201d) the following year, housing both under the name Motown Record Corporation. A local singer friend recommended Eddie, who then told him about Brian\u2019s blossoming musical talents. After Brian\u2019s taste of success co-writing on the Marvelettes\u2019 1961 No 1 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425GpjTSlS4\" title=\"\">Please Mr Postman</a>, he wanted more.</p> <p>Eddie had started making music as a singer but was more interested in writing lyrics \u2013 and the greater riches in songwriting. Dozier was a Motown artist/arranger/songwriter/producer, but the trio realised that by pooling their talents \u2013 Eddie on lyrics, the others music \u2013 they could be greater than the sum of their parts. \u201cWe were young, aggressive and inspired,\u201d Eddie says. \u201cOur music was different. In school, people would tell Brian: \u2018You can\u2019t do a chord like that.\u2019 He\u2019d go: \u2018But it sounds right.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>He continues: \u201cI would always examine a song as it happened and say: \u2018Give me a few more bars on this.\u2019 Brian would ask me why and I\u2019d say: \u2018Because I need the verse part.\u2019 He was relating to it differently to how I was. He\u2019d say: \u2018Your lyrics are getting in the way of my instrumentation. Nobody listens to the lyrics anyway.\u2019 We used to get into long-drawn arguments about that, the importance of words versus music, but then we realised that they meshed together.\u201d</p> <p>Heat Wave, their first smash, a song about erupting love, giddily sung by Martha Reeves, embodies the era\u2019s spirit of excitement and liberation. \u201cI realised that females bought the most records, and they always seemed to be falling in love with somebody,\u201d Eddie says. \u201cI was drawn to that sensitivity. I felt the combination of the music and the female voice would work.\u201d It did. \u201cGirls would come from Cleveland, Chicago, all over the place,\u201d he chuckles. \u201cThey said: \u2018We want to meet you because you understand us.\u2019\u201d</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdI3tppUWzg\" title=\"\"><strong>The Supremes \u2013 Baby Love (1964)</strong></a></h2> <p>Martin Luther King\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IB0i6bJIjw\" title=\"\">1963 speech</a> \u2013 \u201cI have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will be judged not by the colour of their skin, but by the content of their character\u201d \u2013 resonated at Motown. Gordy had his own vision, of a black-owned, black-artist record company making music for all races the world over. The primary vehicle for achieving this, and inspiring generations of black women, were all-female trio the Supremes, although initially their nickname at the company was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jul/15/how-we-made-baby-love-the-supremes\" title=\"\">\u201cthe no-hit Supremes\u201d</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThey needed a hit and we felt we could give them one,\u201d says Eddie. \u201cThey weren\u2019t grown women. They were teenage girls, so we wanted a song about an adult situation with a teenage delivery, and Diana Ross had the perfect voice for that.\u201d</p> <p>The inspiration for Baby Love, their second Supremes No 1 after <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xgklZHORgw\" title=\"\">Where Did Our Love Go</a>, lay close to home. Brian, married with kids, had fallen for Ross, and the pair \u2013 as Eddie puts it \u2013 \u201ccried on each other\u2019s shoulders\u201d. Brian admits they dated and is teased by his older brother. \u201cCome on, Brian! You were in love with her!\u201d Brian corrects him: \u201cWe were in love with each other.\u201d</p> <p>At the piano, Brian poured out his feelings for Ross and started singing \u201cBaby love, oh baby love.\u201d Eddie thought it was a silly title, but took it as the starting point for an exquisite tale of yearning that became a global smash. As for Ross\u2019s unwitting role in the song\u2019s conception, Brian chuckles: \u201cShe had no idea.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"078844bf09ab7ff8dc25d6da951cef401bad2f48\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/078844bf09ab7ff8dc25d6da951cef401bad2f48/0_0_4314_4123/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Four Tops on the TV show Ready, Steady, Go.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"956\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Four Tops on the TV show Ready, Steady, Go.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BIPS/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbk8urfF_hY\" title=\"\"><strong>The Four Tops \u2013 Baby I Need Your Loving (1964)</strong></a></h2> <p>Brian\u2019s marriage to Sharon Pierce started as love at first sight when they were at school. They married when he was 18 and had two children, but she suffered from what we now call bipolar disorder, along with terrible mood swings and migraines. Sharon eventually killed herself, years after the pair had found themselves in a volatile, loveless marriage. \u201cIt was a very, very dark time,\u201d he says. Hurt and rejected, he poured out his pain at the piano: \u201cBaby I need your loving / Got to have all your loving \u2026\u201d Eddie, aware of the situation, wrote the remaining lyrics based upon his brother\u2019s feelings.</p> <p>The song wasn\u2019t right for the Supremes or the Vandellas \u2013 \u201cBrian had such feeling for it, but I didn\u2019t know if anyone could sing it,\u201d Eddie says. It went unused for two years until Motown signed another vocal group. \u201cI remember it like yesterday,\u201d he reminisces. \u201cMickey Stevenson [Motown\u2019s A&amp;R] came into the office and said: \u201cMan, you got anything for the Four Tops? I said: \u2018Yeah, we got something!\u2019\u201d Eddie had remembered this colossus of lyrical agony and melodic ecstasy, which Levi Stubbs sang perfectly to create the Tops\u2019 first hit.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aax5EDQMOq4\" title=\"\"><strong>The Supremes \u2013 Stop! In the Name of Love (196</strong><strong>5)</strong></a></h2> <p>Baby Love starts with the distinctive \u201cOoh, ooh\u201d intro and piles into the chorus; the follow-up hits the chorus from the off. Brian explains: \u201cWe always tried to grab people in the first 10 seconds.\u201d</p> <p>Dozier has said that he came up with the title of the Supremes\u2019 third consecutive US No 1 when he was seeing two women. One confronted the other and he yelled: \u201cStop! In the name of love \u2026\u201d For the lyrics, Eddie drew on his own experiences. Like Brian, he had married young. After getting a neighbour, Almetta Fordham, \u201cin trouble\u201d (ie pregnant) he agreed to marry her to \u201cget her stepfather off her back\u201d on condition that \u201cshe would let me lead a free life, doing what I wanted. I was 16 years old and didn\u2019t know who I was and she would agree with that.\u201d</p> <p>By the time the couple were divorcing, Eddie had started dating his future second wife, Vernelle Craighead, which inspired this heartbreak classic. Eddie explains that the chorus and lines such as: \u201cBaby, I\u2019m aware of where you go\u201d represent his first wife, but the situation was further complicated by another girl who liked him and told Almetta about Vernelle to try and break them up. \u201cA complex situation, but it sure made a good song.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"83547a6f439d9e98c8a88ae6cd4da9b60b694966\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83547a6f439d9e98c8a88ae6cd4da9b60b694966/79_79_2842_2138/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Supremes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"752\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Supremes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQRIOKvR2WM\" title=\"\"><strong>Martha &amp; the Vandellas \u2013 Nowhere to Run (1965)</strong></a></h2> <p>In 2015, Dozier <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/aug/26/lamont-dozier-the-songs-just-kept-coming\" title=\"\">told the Guardian</a> that he came up with the song\u2019s title after meeting a young soldier heading for Vietnam, who had had a premonition that he wouldn\u2019t be coming home \u2013 and was subsequently shipped back in a body bag. Eddie says he was unaware of this and wrote the lyrics about being unable to escape an unhealthy romantic situation. \u201cWhen people become emotionally involved, they have some kind of conflict with themselves,\u201d he explains. \u201cSo the protagonist can\u2019t run from her emotions.\u201d</p> <p>HDH generally tailored songs to an artist. This one was perfect for the emotional hurricane of Reeves\u2019s vocals; the trademark Motown pounding beat was augmented with stomping feet and snow chains thumped against the studio floor.</p> <p>The Vietnam connection endured. In 1988, Nowhere to Run hit the charts again after being used in the Robin Williams film <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093105/\" title=\"\">Good Morning, Vietnam</a>.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3bksUSPB4c\" title=\"\"><strong>The Four Tops \u2013 I Can\u2019t Help Myself (Sugar Pie, Honey Bunch) (1965)</strong></a></h2> <p>Although they mostly wrote songs in the office, HDH didn\u2019t keep regular hours and would work anywhere that inspiration struck. This 1965 chart-topper (which replaced the Supremes\u2019 HDH-penned Back in My Arms Again at No 1) derived from an expression Dozier\u2019s grandfather would use when he was a kid.</p> <p>By now, the trio were feeling the pressure of matching their stellar standards and were, as Eddie notes, \u201cour own biggest critics\u201d. Thus, the brothers remain grateful to the Funk Brothers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/apr/23/dennis-coffey-interview-motown-records\" title=\"\">the crack team of musicians recruited by Stevenson</a> to lay down the instrumentation.</p> <p>\u201cMickey found them in the craziest places,\u201d Eddie says. \u201cBut they were talented jazz guys. At first, they thought our songs were junk. They\u2019d say: \u2018Oh, easy money for us. Those songs are nuthin!\u2019\u201d Brian remembers first seeing seminal bass player <a href=\"https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/james-jamerson-bass-motown-sound/\" title=\"\">James Jamerson</a> lugging his upright bass in school. \u201cI told him: \u2018Why are you lugging that damned thing around? It\u2019s the ugliest instrument I\u2019ve ever seen.\u2019 But he was one of the greatest.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a4f87eec7ad2f1993afce3a90bb88775f21d027\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a4f87eec7ad2f1993afce3a90bb88775f21d027/0_0_5717_4520/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Holland Dozier Holland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"791\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Holland Dozier Holland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpL1TTxffO0\" title=\"\"><strong>The Supremes \u2013 I Hear a Symphony (1965)</strong></a></h2> <p>Disaster struck: the Supremes\u2019 1965 HDH-penned single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTOmuMKWZBc\" title=\"\">Nothing But Heartaches</a> only reached No 10 in the US. Gordy issued an astonishing memo that read: \u201cWe will release nothing less than Top 10 product on any artist and because the Supremes\u2019 worldwide acceptance is greater than the other artists, on them we will only release No 1 records.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt gave us something to strive for,\u201d Eddie says. \u201cReach for the stars! It was a psychological trigger.\u201d It was one that worked. One night, Brian called Eddie to say he had come up with some elongated chords that \u201csounded sorta symphonic\u201d. He then explained that Gordy wanted the song, which had no lyrics, for the Supremes \u2013 and that he wanted it finished and recorded in the morning.</p> <p>\u201cI said: \u2018What?\u2019\u201d Eddie remembers. \u201cNormally, it took us weeks to write a song. Twice I gave up on it and was going to call Brian and tell him: \u2018I can\u2019t do it. I\u2019m tired. I\u2019m burnt out.\u2019 But I didn\u2019t have the heart.\u201d Instead, Eddie went to bed, gambling that he would write the lyrics in the morning. He finished it at noon. \u201cI was still writing the lyrics while we were rehearsing Diana. I swore that I would never put myself through that again.\u201d But it paid off with the Supremes\u2019 sixth US chart-topper.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3C_17FtGG6M\" title=\"\"><strong>The Four Tops \u2013 Bernadette (1967)</strong></a></h2> <p>One of the last big HDH hits before the start of legal wrangles with Motown and, much later, Dozier\u2019s exit from the team, this song\u2019s dramatic, hurtling soul is also rooted in the trio\u2019s colourful love lives. All three were seeing a different Bernadette (well, almost \u2013 Brian\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s middle name was Bernadette). So when Brian came up with an interesting melody and a title, Eddie said: \u201cAre you serious?

      "bodyText": "\u2018I\u2019m the kind of person who loves to be in a crowd and not get noticed,\u201d says Eddie Holland, calling from a golf course in Los Angeles, where he is playing with his brother, Brian. Together with Lamont Dozier, the Hollands formed the legendary Holland-Dozier-Holland (HDH), the crack songwriting-production team whose songs for the likes of the Supremes, Martha and the Vandellas, the Temptations and Marvin Gaye made them, in Stevie Wonder\u2019s words, \u201cthe foundations of Motown\u201d. They went mostly unnoticed compared with the stars, but seven years ago, a church minister convinced the siblings that, now they were in their 70s, it was time to tell their story. \u201cHe told me: \u2018If you don\u2019t write a book, someone else will, and they\u2019re not going to write what you want them to,\u2019\u201d Eddie, 79, says. Thus, the Hollands have penned a revealing autobiography. Named after a song they wrote for the Vandellas, Come and Get These Memories shows how so much era-defining pop music came out of Motown boss Berry Gordy\u2019s small house and studios on 2648 West Grand Boulevard in Detroit. \u201cIf we\u2019d been in New York, we\u2019d have had all these places to go,\u201d Eddie muses. \u201cBut in Detroit there wasn\u2019t anywhere, so we ended up at Motown. It was our club. People could converse, play cards, but Brian and I had our own office because Berry didn\u2019t want anything getting in the way of those hits.\u201d Thirteen of them reached No 1 in the US, and many more remain radio and wedding-disco staples. Brian, 78, admits they never expected such longevity. \u201cAs we\u2019ve got older, it feels like it was a miracle.\u201d Here, they talk through some of those imperishable tunes. Martha and the Vandellas \u2013 Heat Wave (1963) When Brian was eight years old, the Ford Motor Company put on orchestral concerts and invited local kids. \u201cI was greatly impressed by all the violins and bassoons,\u201d he remembers. \u201cIt was like being taken out of myself.\u201d Eddie recognised his brother\u2019s ear for melody and the pair sang around the house. As teenagers, they came to the attention of Gordy, who had founded Tamla Records in 1959 and sister label Motown Records (short for \u201cmotor town\u201d) the following year, housing both under the name Motown Record Corporation. A local singer friend recommended Eddie, who then told him about Brian\u2019s blossoming musical talents. After Brian\u2019s taste of success co-writing on the Marvelettes\u2019 1961 No 1 Please Mr Postman, he wanted more. Eddie had started making music as a singer but was more interested in writing lyrics \u2013 and the greater riches in songwriting. Dozier was a Motown artist/arranger/songwriter/producer, but the trio realised that by pooling their talents \u2013 Eddie on lyrics, the others music \u2013 they could be greater than the sum of their parts. \u201cWe were young, aggressive and inspired,\u201d Eddie says. \u201cOur music was different. In school, people would tell Brian: \u2018You can\u2019t do a chord like that.\u2019 He\u2019d go: \u2018But it sounds right.\u2019\u201d He continues: \u201cI would always examine a song as it happened and say: \u2018Give me a few more bars on this.\u2019 Brian would ask me why and I\u2019d say: \u2018Because I need the verse part.\u2019 He was relating to it differently to how I was. He\u2019d say: \u2018Your lyrics are getting in the way of my instrumentation. Nobody listens to the lyrics anyway.\u2019 We used to get into long-drawn arguments about that, the importance of words versus music, but then we realised that they meshed together.\u201d Heat Wave, their first smash, a song about erupting love, giddily sung by Martha Reeves, embodies the era\u2019s spirit of excitement and liberation. \u201cI realised that females bought the most records, and they always seemed to be falling in love with somebody,\u201d Eddie says. \u201cI was drawn to that sensitivity. I felt the combination of the music and the female voice would work.\u201d It did. \u201cGirls would come from Cleveland, Chicago, all over the place,\u201d he chuckles. \u201cThey said: \u2018We want to meet you because you understand us.\u2019\u201d The Supremes \u2013 Baby Love (1964) Martin Luther King\u2019s 1963 speech \u2013 \u201cI have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will be judged not by the colour of their skin, but by the content of their character\u201d \u2013 resonated at Motown. Gordy had his own vision, of a black-owned, black-artist record company making music for all races the world over. The primary vehicle for achieving this, and inspiring generations of black women, were all-female trio the Supremes, although initially their nickname at the company was \u201cthe no-hit Supremes\u201d. \u201cThey needed a hit and we felt we could give them one,\u201d says Eddie. \u201cThey weren\u2019t grown women. They were teenage girls, so we wanted a song about an adult situation with a teenage delivery, and Diana Ross had the perfect voice for that.\u201d The inspiration for Baby Love, their second Supremes No 1 after Where Did Our Love Go, lay close to home. Brian, married with kids, had fallen for Ross, and the pair \u2013 as Eddie puts it \u2013 \u201ccried on each other\u2019s shoulders\u201d. Brian admits they dated and is teased by his older brother. \u201cCome on, Brian! You were in love with her!\u201d Brian corrects him: \u201cWe were in love with each other.\u201d At the piano, Brian poured out his feelings for Ross and started singing \u201cBaby love, oh baby love.\u201d Eddie thought it was a silly title, but took it as the starting point for an exquisite tale of yearning that became a global smash. As for Ross\u2019s unwitting role in the song\u2019s conception, Brian chuckles: \u201cShe had no idea.\u201d The Four Tops \u2013 Baby I Need Your Loving (1964) Brian\u2019s marriage to Sharon Pierce started as love at first sight when they were at school. They married when he was 18 and had two children, but she suffered from what we now call bipolar disorder, along with terrible mood swings and migraines. Sharon eventually killed herself, years after the pair had found themselves in a volatile, loveless marriage. \u201cIt was a very, very dark time,\u201d he says. Hurt and rejected, he poured out his pain at the piano: \u201cBaby I need your loving / Got to have all your loving \u2026\u201d Eddie, aware of the situation, wrote the remaining lyrics based upon his brother\u2019s feelings. The song wasn\u2019t right for the Supremes or the Vandellas \u2013 \u201cBrian had such feeling for it, but I didn\u2019t know if anyone could sing it,\u201d Eddie says. It went unused for two years until Motown signed another vocal group. \u201cI remember it like yesterday,\u201d he reminisces. \u201cMickey Stevenson [Motown\u2019s A&amp;R] came into the office and said: \u201cMan, you got anything for the Four Tops? I said: \u2018Yeah, we got something!\u2019\u201d Eddie had remembered this colossus of lyrical agony and melodic ecstasy, which Levi Stubbs sang perfectly to create the Tops\u2019 first hit. The Supremes \u2013 Stop! In the Name of Love (1965) Baby Love starts with the distinctive \u201cOoh, ooh\u201d intro and piles into the chorus; the follow-up hits the chorus from the off. Brian explains: \u201cWe always tried to grab people in the first 10 seconds.\u201d Dozier has said that he came up with the title of the Supremes\u2019 third consecutive US No 1 when he was seeing two women. One confronted the other and he yelled: \u201cStop! In the name of love \u2026\u201d For the lyrics, Eddie drew on his own experiences. Like Brian, he had married young. After getting a neighbour, Almetta Fordham, \u201cin trouble\u201d (ie pregnant) he agreed to marry her to \u201cget her stepfather off her back\u201d on condition that \u201cshe would let me lead a free life, doing what I wanted. I was 16 years old and didn\u2019t know who I was and she would agree with that.\u201d By the time the couple were divorcing, Eddie had started dating his future second wife, Vernelle Craighead, which inspired this heartbreak classic. Eddie explains that the chorus and lines such as: \u201cBaby, I\u2019m aware of where you go\u201d represent his first wife, but the situation was further complicated by another girl who liked him and told Almetta about Vernelle to try and break them up. \u201cA complex situation, but it sure made a good song.\u201d Martha &amp; the Vandellas \u2013 Nowhere to Run (1965) In 2015, Dozier told the Guardian that he came up with the song\u2019s title after meeting a young soldier heading for Vietnam, who had had a premonition that he wouldn\u2019t be coming home \u2013 and was subsequently shipped back in a body bag. Eddie says he was unaware of this and wrote the lyrics about being unable to escape an unhealthy romantic situation. \u201cWhen people become emotionally involved, they have some kind of conflict with themselves,\u201d he explains. \u201cSo the protagonist can\u2019t run from her emotions.\u201d HDH generally tailored songs to an artist. This one was perfect for the emotional hurricane of Reeves\u2019s vocals; the trademark Motown pounding beat was augmented with stomping feet and snow chains thumped against the studio floor. The Vietnam connection endured. In 1988, Nowhere to Run hit the charts again after being used in the Robin Williams film Good Morning, Vietnam. The Four Tops \u2013 I Can\u2019t Help Myself (Sugar Pie, Honey Bunch) (1965) Although they mostly wrote songs in the office, HDH didn\u2019t keep regular hours and would work anywhere that inspiration struck. This 1965 chart-topper (which replaced the Supremes\u2019 HDH-penned Back in My Arms Again at No 1) derived from an expression Dozier\u2019s grandfather would use when he was a kid. By now, the trio were feeling the pressure of matching their stellar standards and were, as Eddie notes, \u201cour own biggest critics\u201d. Thus, the brothers remain grateful to the Funk Brothers, the crack team of musicians recruited by Stevenson to lay down the instrumentation. \u201cMickey found them in the craziest places,\u201d Eddie says. \u201cBut they were talented jazz guys. At first, they thought our songs were junk. They\u2019d say: \u2018Oh, easy money for us. Those songs are nuthin!\u2019\u201d Brian remembers first seeing seminal bass player James Jamerson lugging his upright bass in school. \u201cI told him: \u2018Why are you lugging that damned thing around? It\u2019s the ugliest instrument I\u2019ve ever seen.\u2019 But he was one of the greatest.\u201d The Supremes \u2013 I Hear a Symphony (1965) Disaster struck: the Supremes\u2019 1965 HDH-penned single Nothing But Heartaches only reached No 10 in the US. Gordy issued an astonishing memo that read: \u201cWe will release nothing less than Top 10 product on any artist and because the Supremes\u2019 worldwide acceptance is greater than the other artists, on them we will only release No 1 records.\u201d \u201cIt gave us something to strive for,\u201d Eddie says. \u201cReach for the stars! It was a psychological trigger.\u201d It was one that worked. One night, Brian called Eddie to say he had come up with some elongated chords that \u201csounded sorta symphonic\u201d. He then explained that Gordy wanted the song, which had no lyrics, for the Supremes \u2013 and that he wanted it finished and recorded in the morning. \u201cI said: \u2018What?\u2019\u201d Eddie remembers. \u201cNormally, it took us weeks to write a song. Twice I gave up on it and was going to call Brian and tell him: \u2018I can\u2019t do it. I\u2019m tired. I\u2019m burnt out.\u2019 But I didn\u2019t have the heart.\u201d Instead, Eddie went to bed, gambling that he would write the lyrics in the morning. He finished it at noon. \u201cI was still writing the lyrics while we were rehearsing Diana. I swore that I would never put myself through that again.\u201d But it paid off with the Supremes\u2019 sixth US chart-topper. The Four Tops \u2013 Bernadette (1967) One of the last big HDH hits before the start of legal wrangles with Motown and, much later, Dozier\u2019s exit from the team, this song\u2019s dramatic, hurtling soul is also rooted in the trio\u2019s colourful love lives. All three were seeing a different Bernadette (well, almost \u2013 Brian\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s middle name was Bernadette).

The university was founded by the billionaire financier and philanthropist George Soros, whom Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government has depicted as an enemy who wants to destroy the country.</p> <p>Kar\u00e1csony said that while he had no power to change the legal framework, he would assure CEU it was welcome in the city and would propose the establishment of a new scientific academy devoted to research and innovation based at the university.</p> <p>He said he and Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government would look to see if there was a way to work together. \u201cMy political philosophy is all about compromise and building consensus.

Zolt\u00e1n Kov\u00e1cs, Orb\u00e1n\u2019s spokesman, wrote on his blog in the aftermath of the result: \u201cWinning more than 50% of all votes, [Fidesz] has once again shown that it\u2019s still by far Hungary\u2019s strongest political force.\u201d</p> <p>However, analysts say wresting the capital from Fidesz\u2019s control will be a huge psychological boost for the Hungarian opposition, riven by years of infighting and irrelevance. The next nationwide elections are due in 2022.</p> <p>Kar\u00e1csony said people in Budapest and other big cities were no different to other Hungarians but had access to \u201ca totally different media landscape\u201d that helped to puncture government propaganda.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Flora Garamvolgyi.</em></p>",

Kar\u00e1csony said once he took office he would increase cooperation with the liberal mayor of Warsaw, Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski, and other central European mayors to counterbalance the confrontational stance that Hungarian and Polish governments have taken with Brussels in recent years. \u201cThe governments of these countries are taking us away from the core of Europe, when this is the region that should be the most interested in not having a two-tier Europe,\u201d he said. On his first day in office on Friday, Kar\u00e1csony plans to send two letters, one to Orb\u00e1n asking for a meeting, and the other to the rector of Central European University asking the institution to keep as many courses as possible in Budapest. The university, which teaches master\u2019s degrees in English to students from across the world, has been forced to move some of its courses to Vienna after the government refused to accredit it to issue US degrees in Hungary. The university was founded by the billionaire financier and philanthropist George Soros, whom Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government has depicted as an enemy who wants to destroy the country. Kar\u00e1csony said that while he had no power to change the legal framework, he would assure CEU it was welcome in the city and would propose the establishment of a new scientific academy devoted to research and innovation based at the university. He said he and Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government would look to see if there was a way to work together. \u201cMy political philosophy is all about compromise and building consensus. Sometimes I wish I was a politician in a Nordic country where you could govern by consensus, but now my job is to fight for peace,\u201d he said. While he wanted a constructive relationship, there were values he would not compromise on, and he said if Fidesz decided to go down the route of confrontation, \u201cwe are ready to pick up the gauntlet\u201d. He said priorities for his first year in charge were to improve the social safety net for low-income families, divert more funding to homeless shelters and make improvements to public transport. He has promised to boost Budapest\u2019s green credentials and to attend the city\u2019s annual pride march. Pro-government media has claimed Kar\u00e1csony only won with the votes of foreigners living in Budapest. Orb\u00e1n has downplayed the results, pointing to a strong showing in the countryside and a small increase in the number of votes gained by Fidesz overall. Zolt\u00e1n Kov\u00e1cs, Orb\u00e1n\u2019s spokesman, wrote on his blog in the aftermath of the result: \u201cWinning more than 50% of all votes, [Fidesz] has once again shown that it\u2019s still by far Hungary\u2019s strongest political force.\u201d However, analysts say wresting the capital from Fidesz\u2019s control will be a huge psychological boost for the Hungarian opposition, riven by years of infighting and irrelevance. The next nationwide elections are due in 2022. Kar\u00e1csony said people in Budapest and other big cities were no different to other Hungarians but had access to \u201ca totally different media landscape\u201d that helped to puncture government propaganda.

      "body": "<p>Who decides what qualifies as \u201creal cinema\u201d? Martin Scorsese, possessor of perhaps the most potent reputation (as cineaste and film-maker) in Hollywood, has apparently decided that it is him. After describing the Marvel movies as \u201ctheme parks\u201d and \u201cnot cinema\u201d <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481615/martin-scorsese-has-some-blunt-thoughts-on-marvel-movies-and-james-gunn-is-sad-about-it\">in an interview with Empire published earlier this month</a>, the celebrated director of Taxi Driver and Goodfellas <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMej9AXZT_A\">doubled down this week at the London film festival</a>, where he is promoting his highly anticipated feature The Irishman.</p> <p>\u201cWhat has to be protected is the singular experience of experiencing a picture, ideally with an audience,\u201d Scorsese opined. \u201cBut there\u2019s room for so many others now, and so many other ways. There\u2019s going to be crossovers, completely. The value of a film that\u2019s like a theme park film, for example, the Marvel-type pictures, where the theatres become amusement parks, that\u2019s a different experience. I was saying earlier, it\u2019s not cinema, it\u2019s something else.\u201d</p> <p>To say that Scorsese\u2019s comments have inspired a furious backlash would be to ignore the reverence in which the Oscar-winner is held by many of those who find his recent comments unpalatable. So let us say merely that there plenty of film-makers out there, most of whom have worked on superhero movies at one time or another, that disagree with him fiercely.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4c42fede82601177d24f032c026f4ff31208cc59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c42fede82601177d24f032c026f4ff31208cc59/0_0_5351_3585/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christians protest outside a Manhattan cinema, in 1988, at the screening of The Last Temptation of Christ\" width=\"1000\" height=\"670\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christians protest outside a Manhattan cinema, in 1988, at the screening of The Last Temptation of Christ</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Barbara Alper/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kevin Smith <a href=\"https://www.nme.com/news/film/kevin-smith-defends-marvel-movies-martin-scorsese-criticism-made-biggest-superhero-movie-ever-2557447\">reminded Scorsese that his own 1988 film The Last Temptation of Christ resembles a superhero flick</a> for those who are not religiously minded. Thor: Ragnarok director Taika Waititi, currently picking up Oscar buzz for his Nazi satire Jojo Rabbit, <a href=\"https://www.nme.com/news/film/taika-waititi-hits-back-martin-scorceses-marvel-comments-course-cinema-2557563\">said simply: \u201cOf course it\u2019s cinema! It\u2019s at the movies,\u201d</a> while Guardians of the Galaxy\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nme.com/news/film/martin-scorsese-claims-marvel-movies-not-cinema-2554040\">James Gunn tweeted</a>: \u201cMartin Scorsese is one of my 5 favourite living film-makers. I was outraged when people picketed The Last Temptation of Christ without having seen the film. I\u2019m saddened that he\u2019s now judging my films in the same way.\u201d</p> <p>There are a million ways to unpick Scorsese\u2019s argument. For a start, the film-maker\u2019s attempts to label superhero films as corporate entities rather than examples of high art would appear to ignore almost every big-budget, special effects-laden film that has been made since Steven Spielberg\u2019s Jaws and George Lucas\u2019s Star Wars ushered in the blockbuster era in the mid 1970s. That is to wipe a lot of other people\u2019s filmgoing experiences from the history books, purely on the basis of the director\u2019s own view of film as \u201chuman beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being\u201d.</p> <p>A more cogent unravelling of Scorsese\u2019s argument can be obtained by examining the film-maker\u2019s own movies, as well as the history of film that the King of Comedy director cherishes so deeply. Let us take for an example 2011\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/nov/23/hugo-martin-scorsese-film-review\">Hugo</a>, the whimsical Scorsese fantasy set at a railway station in 1930s Paris.

      "bodyText": "Who decides what qualifies as \u201creal cinema\u201d? Martin Scorsese, possessor of perhaps the most potent reputation (as cineaste and film-maker) in Hollywood, has apparently decided that it is him. After describing the Marvel movies as \u201ctheme parks\u201d and \u201cnot cinema\u201d in an interview with Empire published earlier this month, the celebrated director of Taxi Driver and Goodfellas doubled down this week at the London film festival, where he is promoting his highly anticipated feature The Irishman. \u201cWhat has to be protected is the singular experience of experiencing a picture, ideally with an audience,\u201d Scorsese opined. \u201cBut there\u2019s room for so many others now, and so many other ways. There\u2019s going to be crossovers, completely. The value of a film that\u2019s like a theme park film, for example, the Marvel-type pictures, where the theatres become amusement parks, that\u2019s a different experience. I was saying earlier, it\u2019s not cinema, it\u2019s something else.\u201d To say that Scorsese\u2019s comments have inspired a furious backlash would be to ignore the reverence in which the Oscar-winner is held by many of those who find his recent comments unpalatable. So let us say merely that there plenty of film-makers out there, most of whom have worked on superhero movies at one time or another, that disagree with him fiercely. Kevin Smith reminded Scorsese that his own 1988 film The Last Temptation of Christ resembles a superhero flick for those who are not religiously minded. Thor: Ragnarok director Taika Waititi, currently picking up Oscar buzz for his Nazi satire Jojo Rabbit, said simply: \u201cOf course it\u2019s cinema! It\u2019s at the movies,\u201d while Guardians of the Galaxy\u2019s James Gunn tweeted: \u201cMartin Scorsese is one of my 5 favourite living film-makers. I was outraged when people picketed The Last Temptation of Christ without having seen the film. I\u2019m saddened that he\u2019s now judging my films in the same way.\u201d There are a million ways to unpick Scorsese\u2019s argument. For a start, the film-maker\u2019s attempts to label superhero films as corporate entities rather than examples of high art would appear to ignore almost every big-budget, special effects-laden film that has been made since Steven Spielberg\u2019s Jaws and George Lucas\u2019s Star Wars ushered in the blockbuster era in the mid 1970s. That is to wipe a lot of other people\u2019s filmgoing experiences from the history books, purely on the basis of the director\u2019s own view of film as \u201chuman beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being\u201d. A more cogent unravelling of Scorsese\u2019s argument can be obtained by examining the film-maker\u2019s own movies, as well as the history of film that the King of Comedy director cherishes so deeply. Let us take for an example 2011\u2019s Hugo, the whimsical Scorsese fantasy set at a railway station in 1930s Paris. The movie is obsessed with the films of Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s, and particularly the French pioneer of early cinema\u2019s classic space fantasy A Trip to the Moon. If there was ever a film to evoke a sense of childlike wonder in audiences \u2013 much like comic-book movies, some might say \u2013 it is this one. Astronauts travel to the moon, where they encounter a phantasmagorical lunar landscape of Carrollian mushrooms, cosmic rain showers and bizarre extraterrestrials. There is not much here in the way of narrative sophistication, frankly, and yet this was the film that Scorsese chose as the central pivot in one of his essential arguments within Hugo \u2013 that we need to preserve and celebrate both the history of film and the film-makers that helped make it. The director would no doubt point out that M\u00e9li\u00e8s\u2019s work comes from a different place, that it is inspired by magical inner reveries rather than the prospect of selling theme park tickets and toys. But it is hard not to see more than a hint of A Trip to the Moon in films such as Gunn\u2019s own Guardians of the Galaxy 2, in which our heroes head find themselves trapped among the psychedelic flora of Kurt Russell\u2019s Ego the Living Planet. Moreover, technical innovation itself, as much as storytelling, is surely a valid element of cinema\u2019s capacity to manifest as high art. M\u00e9li\u00e8s hand-painted individual cells to create some of the earliest colour cinematography, while his techniques were extensively copied by the earliest Hollywood film-makers, at a time when the fledgling US film industry was still lagging behind its European counterpart. Marvel, funnily enough, is known for pioneering the art of digital de-aging, in films such as Captain Marvel and Captain America: Civil War.

      "body": "<p>The Japanese equivalent of deja vu is called <em>kishikan</em> and there is plenty of it in the air following the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/17/rugby-world-cup-england-team-australia\" title=\"\">announcement of the England team</a> to face Australia in Saturday\u2019s World Cup quarter-final. Suddenly it is 2015 all over again, with George Ford ousted from the No 10 shirt on the eve of a defining game. English rugby, for better or worse, has lurched back to the future.</p> <p>It is a huge call in anyone\u2019s language on the eve of the squad\u2019s biggest game for four years. Ford has been his side\u2019s best player in Japan: alert, deft, skilful and smart. Owen Farrell, by contrast, has not been nearly as influential at 12. So how has Eddie Jones reacted? By picking Farrell at 10 and redeploying a disappointed (Jones\u2019s word) Ford on the bench. If England win \u2013 as they have their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/nov/24/england-australia-autumn-international-report\" title=\"\">past six</a> Test meetings against Australia in the Jones era \u2013 it will be seen as a masterstroke. If not, Jones will be remembered as the obsessive tinkerman who flip-flopped once too often.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/17/rugby-world-cup-england-team-australia\">England drop George Ford with Owen Farrell at fly-half for Australia clash</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is not a great deal in between. Snatching the baton off your in-form conductor is not how the world\u2019s top orchestras tend to operate. The Last Night of the Poms? It could yet happen if England fail to react positively to the switch and Jones has misjudged the internal mood music. Ford has been his country\u2019s starting 10 in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/05/england-argentina-rugby-world-cup-2019-pool-c-match-report\" title=\"\">all three</a> of their games here: all three have been victories with a try bonus point. Farrell, furthermore, has started at 10 in one of his country\u2019s past seven Tests.</p> <p>If it feels like a slightly perverse gamble to be taking at this juncture, that is because it is. For many England supporters it will also induce a Groundhog Day shudder, given the uneasy precedent of 2015. Then, Ford made no secret of his disappointment at being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/13/george-ford-england-rugby-world-cup-bath-stuart-lancaster-sam-burgess\" title=\"\">jettisoned by Stuart Lancaster</a> for the all-important Twickenham pool fixtures against Wales and Australia. England ended up disappearing into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/sep/27/england-wales-rugby-world-cup-stuart-lancaster\" title=\"\">an abyss of their own indecision</a> and the house of Lancaster crumbled shortly afterwards.</p> <p>It was a similar story in 1999. Clive Woodward dropped his No 10, Jonny Wilkinson, for Paul Grayson for their quarter-final against South Africa and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/1999/oct/25/rugbyworldcup2003.rugbyunion\" title=\"\">England subsequently bowed out</a>. Then there is the more recent case of Danny Cipriani, a match-clincher in the third Test against South Africa last year before being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/22/danny-cipriani-left-out-of-england-squad\" title=\"\">summarily cast aside</a>. New Zealand won the 2011 World Cup despite their leading fly-halves all ending up injured, but it is not a position where chopping and changing makes life more straightforward.</p> <p>Jones, though, remains a fervent believer that World Cups are won by hard-nosed sides who avoid getting suckered into playing much fancy stuff. \u201cOnce you get to the quarter-finals it\u2019s about having the right mindset,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about us playing to our strengths and trying to take away from what Australia want. We need to defend with brutality and when we have the ball we need play on top of them.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.<br></figcaption> </figure>  <p>In other words, England think their best bet against the Wallabies \u2013 and, should it come to it, New Zealand next week \u2013 is to revive their old \u201cwhite orcs on steroids\u201d persona. Play hard and direct, don\u2019t overcomplicate the gameplan, hang tough for the duration. Should his squad go on to lift the Webb Ellis Cup, Jones\u2019s reputation as a tactical genius will be duly secured. Stumble now, though, and harsh questions will have to be asked, not least whether a dictatorial regime has delivered the big match returns it should have done.</p> <p>No pressure, then, because Jones has also taken several punts elsewhere. No one doubts Henry Slade\u2019s class but he has played 40 minutes since 1 June. The recalled Mako Vunipola has had even less game time, while England\u2019s premier lineout caller George Kruis is on the bench.</p> <p>It will be a minor miracle if Billy Vunipola plays the game of his life, given how sore the big man\u2019s ankle looked when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/05/billy-vunipola-ankle-injury-england-world-cup-rugby-union\" title=\"\">limped off against Argentina</a>. Slade and Manu Tuilagi did play together outside Farrell in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/02/ireland-england-six-nations-match-report\" title=\"\">stunning win over Ireland in Dublin</a> in February but the trio also started the loss to Wales and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/mar/16/england-scotland-six-nations-match-report\" title=\"\">draw with Scotland</a>. For all Jones\u2019s insistence about horses for courses and his finishers being as important as his starters, it would appear he primarily just wants to bosh the Wallabies first and then ask questions afterwards.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9650e7d44380e5461ef7bfad64cd3d3dba38ac6d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9650e7d44380e5461ef7bfad64cd3d3dba38ac6d/126_217_2131_1277/1000.jpg\" alt=\"England\u2019s coach Eddie Jones has not shied away from tough decisions\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">England\u2019s coach Eddie Jones has not shied away from tough decisions.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: William West/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His teamsheet could also have more to do with rejuvenating Farrell before a potential semi-final with New Zealand than anything else. As Cipriani and now Ford have discovered, Jones is instinctively drawn to the warrior spirit that pours from the Saracens fly-half \u2013 seven days a week, 365 days a year \u2013 like steam from a hot geyser. Whether or not he was worried about Australia targeting Ford\u2019s defence, he also needs to find a way of releasing Tuilagi\u2019s full destructive potential. What he absolutely cannot afford is for Australia to start playing as they did in the second half against Wales, when they belatedly found some space and expertly exploited it.</p> <p>If they are going to win this World Cup, England will be hoping their forwards supply them with a dynamic platform regardless of who starts at 10. Should Ford have to come on with 10 minutes to go to rescue his side from the jaws of defeat, though, how wise will Jones\u2019s selection really have been?

      "bodyText": "The Japanese equivalent of deja vu is called kishikan and there is plenty of it in the air following the announcement of the England team to face Australia in Saturday\u2019s World Cup quarter-final. Suddenly it is 2015 all over again, with George Ford ousted from the No 10 shirt on the eve of a defining game. English rugby, for better or worse, has lurched back to the future. It is a huge call in anyone\u2019s language on the eve of the squad\u2019s biggest game for four years. Ford has been his side\u2019s best player in Japan: alert, deft, skilful and smart. Owen Farrell, by contrast, has not been nearly as influential at 12. So how has Eddie Jones reacted? By picking Farrell at 10 and redeploying a disappointed (Jones\u2019s word) Ford on the bench. If England win \u2013 as they have their past six Test meetings against Australia in the Jones era \u2013 it will be seen as a masterstroke. If not, Jones will be remembered as the obsessive tinkerman who flip-flopped once too often. There is not a great deal in between. Snatching the baton off your in-form conductor is not how the world\u2019s top orchestras tend to operate. The Last Night of the Poms? It could yet happen if England fail to react positively to the switch and Jones has misjudged the internal mood music. Ford has been his country\u2019s starting 10 in all three of their games here: all three have been victories with a try bonus point. Farrell, furthermore, has started at 10 in one of his country\u2019s past seven Tests. If it feels like a slightly perverse gamble to be taking at this juncture, that is because it is. For many England supporters it will also induce a Groundhog Day shudder, given the uneasy precedent of 2015. Then, Ford made no secret of his disappointment at being jettisoned by Stuart Lancaster for the all-important Twickenham pool fixtures against Wales and Australia. England ended up disappearing into an abyss of their own indecision and the house of Lancaster crumbled shortly afterwards. It was a similar story in 1999. Clive Woodward dropped his No 10, Jonny Wilkinson, for Paul Grayson for their quarter-final against South Africa and England subsequently bowed out. Then there is the more recent case of Danny Cipriani, a match-clincher in the third Test against South Africa last year before being summarily cast aside. New Zealand won the 2011 World Cup despite their leading fly-halves all ending up injured, but it is not a position where chopping and changing makes life more straightforward. Jones, though, remains a fervent believer that World Cups are won by hard-nosed sides who avoid getting suckered into playing much fancy stuff. \u201cOnce you get to the quarter-finals it\u2019s about having the right mindset,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about us playing to our strengths and trying to take away from what Australia want. We need to defend with brutality and when we have the ball we need play on top of them.\u201d In other words, England think their best bet against the Wallabies \u2013 and, should it come to it, New Zealand next week \u2013 is to revive their old \u201cwhite orcs on steroids\u201d persona. Play hard and direct, don\u2019t overcomplicate the gameplan, hang tough for the duration. Should his squad go on to lift the Webb Ellis Cup, Jones\u2019s reputation as a tactical genius will be duly secured. Stumble now, though, and harsh questions will have to be asked, not least whether a dictatorial regime has delivered the big match returns it should have done. No pressure, then, because Jones has also taken several punts elsewhere. No one doubts Henry Slade\u2019s class but he has played 40 minutes since 1 June. The recalled Mako Vunipola has had even less game time, while England\u2019s premier lineout caller George Kruis is on the bench. It will be a minor miracle if Billy Vunipola plays the game of his life, given how sore the big man\u2019s ankle looked when he limped off against Argentina. Slade and Manu Tuilagi did play together outside Farrell in the stunning win over Ireland in Dublin in February but the trio also started the loss to Wales and the draw with Scotland. For all Jones\u2019s insistence about horses for courses and his finishers being as important as his starters, it would appear he primarily just wants to bosh the Wallabies first and then ask questions afterwards. His teamsheet could also have more to do with rejuvenating Farrell before a potential semi-final with New Zealand than anything else. As Cipriani and now Ford have discovered, Jones is instinctively drawn to the warrior spirit that pours from the Saracens fly-half \u2013 seven days a week, 365 days a year \u2013 like steam from a hot geyser. Whether or not he was worried about Australia targeting Ford\u2019s defence, he also needs to find a way of releasing Tuilagi\u2019s full destructive potential. What he absolutely cannot afford is for Australia to start playing as they did in the second half against Wales, when they belatedly found some space and expertly exploited it. If they are going to win this World Cup, England will be hoping their forwards supply them with a dynamic platform regardless of who starts at 10. Should Ford have to come on with 10 minutes to go to rescue his side from the jaws of defeat, though, how wise will Jones\u2019s selection really have been? All those months and years of talking up the priceless value of dual playmakers at 10 and 12 currently have a hollow ring. Alternatively, could it simply be that Jones is so deeply haunted by the notion of losing to his old mate Michael Cheika that visions of Samu Kerevi potentially running over Ford have been keeping him awake at night? Get bounced by the Wallabies and four years of work will vanish down the gurgler. If England do end up flying home on Monday, their players will be massively disappointed but for Jones it would be the end of the world.",

In the past few months we have covered stories ranging from the record-breaking European heatwave, where temperatures of over 45C were recorded in France for the first time, a heatwave and drought in India, where thousands abandoned their homes, and the unprecedented Arctic wildfires that could be seen from space. Such events are not just \u201cweather\u201d, however, and we follow their impact: the buckling European road and rail infrastructure not suitable for the new climate era, the desperate search for water in Chennai and the Greenland residents traumatised by the climate emergency as life becomes more precarious and social problems such as alcoholism intensify. In Italy, the Planpincieux glacier in the Mont Blanc massif is changing so rapidly that avalanches and debris falls have led to deaths and evacuations, leaving residents in the town of Courmayeur fearing how much longer it will hold. Our reporters have also travelled to where governments and individuals are making it worse.

      "body": "<p>These days, you can\u2019t move for grandiose, album-length state-of-the-nation addresses. Everyone\u2019s at it. Grime MCs rap them, singer-songwriters earnestly intone them, latterday punk bands shout them while wearing only their underpants, mainstream pop stars employ armies of Swedes to write them on their behalf.</p> <p>You might have expected rock and pop music to respond to the ongoing lunacy of current events with a series of short, sharp reactions. But a certain verbosity, a desire to make large, imposing statements, seems to have taken precedence. Who would have thought that the rise of rightwing populism would turn artists not into the 21st-century equivalents of the Sex Pistols, Public Enemy or the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/mar/08/artsfeatures.popandrock\">Ghost Town-era Specials</a>, but Jethro Tull circa Thick As a Brick? Given this, there is something oddly impressive about Foals\u2019 desire to make a state-of-the-nation address even more grandiose than everyone else\u2019s.</p> <p>Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost is not a double album but an album in two parts, which somehow feels more wilfully lavish and ostentatious, and puts it in a very slender pantheon within rock history. It breathes the same rarefied air as the Kinks\u2019 Preservation Acts 1 and 2, Guns N\u2019 Roses\u2019 Use Your Illusion I &amp; II, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer\u2019s Works Vols 1 &amp; 2 and Frank Zappa\u2019s Joe\u2019s Garage Acts I, II &amp; III. They seem to have missed a trick by labelling the two albums as \u201cparts\u201d rather than \u201cacts\u201d, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/frank-zappa\">Frank Zappa</a> did \u2013 and indeed by failing to open them with an 18-minute piano concerto in three movements, as ELP did. But somewhere in the hereafter, you suspect Messrs Zappa and Emerson \u2013 men who could be accused of many things, but never of taking themselves insufficiently seriously \u2013 are nodding their approval at Foals\u2019 explanation for the whole concept: \u201cOur creative desire and ambition has not been able to be conveyed on a 40-minute, 10-track album\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8xZje1jbI0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/h8xZje1jbI0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8xZje1jbI0\">Watch the video for The Runner</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>It\u2019s hard not to applaud that remark. Fear of social-media backlash has led to a catastrophic shortage of rock bands saying ludicrous, self-regarding things in recent years. And, in fairness, it was hard not to applaud at least some of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/mar/08/foals-everything-not-saved-will-be-lost-part-1-album-review\">Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost Part 1</a>. As is the way with Foals, it wasn\u2019t quite as clever as it thought it was, but you could see why it ended up nominated for a Mercury prize. There was something compelling about its slippery progress from post-punk funk to smartphone-torches-on arena anthemics.

      "bodyText": "These days, you can\u2019t move for grandiose, album-length state-of-the-nation addresses. Everyone\u2019s at it. Grime MCs rap them, singer-songwriters earnestly intone them, latterday punk bands shout them while wearing only their underpants, mainstream pop stars employ armies of Swedes to write them on their behalf. You might have expected rock and pop music to respond to the ongoing lunacy of current events with a series of short, sharp reactions. But a certain verbosity, a desire to make large, imposing statements, seems to have taken precedence. Who would have thought that the rise of rightwing populism would turn artists not into the 21st-century equivalents of the Sex Pistols, Public Enemy or the Ghost Town-era Specials, but Jethro Tull circa Thick As a Brick? Given this, there is something oddly impressive about Foals\u2019 desire to make a state-of-the-nation address even more grandiose than everyone else\u2019s. Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost is not a double album but an album in two parts, which somehow feels more wilfully lavish and ostentatious, and puts it in a very slender pantheon within rock history. It breathes the same rarefied air as the Kinks\u2019 Preservation Acts 1 and 2, Guns N\u2019 Roses\u2019 Use Your Illusion I &amp; II, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer\u2019s Works Vols 1 &amp; 2 and Frank Zappa\u2019s Joe\u2019s Garage Acts I, II &amp; III. They seem to have missed a trick by labelling the two albums as \u201cparts\u201d rather than \u201cacts\u201d, as Frank Zappa did \u2013 and indeed by failing to open them with an 18-minute piano concerto in three movements, as ELP did. But somewhere in the hereafter, you suspect Messrs Zappa and Emerson \u2013 men who could be accused of many things, but never of taking themselves insufficiently seriously \u2013 are nodding their approval at Foals\u2019 explanation for the whole concept: \u201cOur creative desire and ambition has not been able to be conveyed on a 40-minute, 10-track album\u201d. It\u2019s hard not to applaud that remark. Fear of social-media backlash has led to a catastrophic shortage of rock bands saying ludicrous, self-regarding things in recent years. And, in fairness, it was hard not to applaud at least some of Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost Part 1. As is the way with Foals, it wasn\u2019t quite as clever as it thought it was, but you could see why it ended up nominated for a Mercury prize. There was something compelling about its slippery progress from post-punk funk to smartphone-torches-on arena anthemics. Its successor is touted as a more straightforward rock album, the lyrics tracking the loosely hopeful, nature-prevails aftermath of the apocalyptic scenario conjured on Part 1. And despite the presence of a portentous synth prelude and a brief, ambient piano interlude, that\u2019s largely what it sounds like. The riffs are frequently noisy and vaguely Zeppelin-ish, the drums similarly slip their moorings from the agitated indie-disco chatter of Dreaming Of towards When the Levee Breaks pounding. On 10,000 Ft, they drag the song away from an intro that unexpectedly recalls the Stone Roses and take it somewhere heavier: a pleasing and surprising shift in gear. Whether you think setting Black Bull\u2019s critique of swaggering machismo to swaggering, grunting garage rock is a witty act of d\u00e9tournement or a pretty bare-faced case of trying to have one\u2019s cake and eat it is up to you, but there\u2019s no getting around the fact that the end result is potent. Elsewhere, the album slathers on poppy choruses, as on The Runner and Wash Off, and breaks ranks on the concluding 10,000 Ft and Neptune.

Trump sends bizarre, threatening letter to Turkish president Donald Trump\u2019s chaotic foreign policy has been further exposed by the emergence of a bizarre letter he sent to Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, warning the Turkish president \u201cdon\u2019t be a tough guy\u201d as Turkish forces launched their offensive in northern Syria. On Wednesday, Democrats walked out of a White House meeting after clashing with Trump on the issue of Syria. Senator Chuck Schumer said Trump had called the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, a \u201cthird-rate politician\u201d. Pelosi described Trump\u2019s outburst as a \u201cserious meltdown\u201d. \u2018Strategically brilliant\u2019? Trump has insisted his controversial decision to withdraw US troops from north-eastern Syria was in fact \u201cstrategically brilliant\u201d, claiming the Kurds he abandoned were \u201cmuch safer now\u201d, and adding that they were, after all, \u201cno angels\u201d. Pompeo \u2018ignored\u2019 pleas to support Ukraine ambassador The secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, ignored pleas to support the former US ambassador to Ukraine before she was ousted by the White House, apparently for political reasons, according to one of Pompeo\u2019s former senior advisers. Michael McKinley testified as part of the congressional impeachment hearings on Wednesday, reportedly saying he had asked Pompeo several times to speak up for the ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, but that his appeals were \u201cgreeted with silence\u201d \u2013 prompting him finally to resign last week. Rudy Giuliani. Yovanovitch was pulled from her post in May, apparently at the urging of Rudy Giuliani. On Wednesday, a 44-year-old man turned himself in to authorities over allegations he conspired with several others, including a Ukrainian-born associate of Giuliani\u2019s, to make illegal political contributions. Ambivalence in Bolivia as Morales seeks a fourth term Bolivia is preparing to go to the polls on 20 October, with President Evo Morales seeking a fourth term after 13 years in power. His socialist government has maintained its popularity by investing the profits from a commodity boom into infrastructure and social programmes. But some are ambivalent about his continued rule, given the country\u2019s history of authoritarianism, as Linda Farthing reports from La Paz. Wildfire response. Until recently Morales\u2019s re-election was considered all but inevitable, but the recent devastating Amazon wildfires \u2013 and in particular his government\u2019s slow response \u2013 have slowed the president\u2019s campaign momentum.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump warned his counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan \u201cdon\u2019t be a fool\u201d and said history risked branding him a \u201cdevil\u201d in an extraordinary letter sent the day Turkey launched its incursion into north-eastern Syria. The letter, first obtained by a Fox Business reporter, was shorn of diplomatic niceties and began with an outright threat. \u201cLet\u2019s work out a good deal!\u201d Trump wrote in the letter dated 9 October, whose authenticity was confirmed to various news outlets by the White House. Days after appearing to greenlight an invasion by pulling US troops from the Kurdish-dominated region, Trump told the Turkish president he would wreck Ankara\u2019s economy if the invasion went too far. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be responsible for slaughtering thousands of people, and I don\u2019t want to be responsible for destroying the Turkish economy \u2013 and I will,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHistory will look upon you favorably if you get this done the right and humane way,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cIt will look upon you forever as the devil if good things don\u2019t happen.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be a tough guy. Don\u2019t be a fool!\u201d he finished, adding: \u201cI will call you later.\u201d International and domestic reaction was for the most part incredulous. Erdo\u011fan \u201creceived the letter, thoroughly rejected it and put it in the bin\u201d, Turkish presidential sources told the BBC on Thursday. There was no immediate comment from Turkish officials on the BBC report. The Kremlin questioned the letter\u2019s tone. \u201cYou don\u2019t often encounter such language in correspondence between heads of state. It\u2019s a highly unusual letter,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call. In the US, many at first questioned the letter\u2019s legitimacy. Some called it a \u201cjoke\u201d and an \u201cembarrassment\u201d. \u201cI actually thought it was a prank, a joke, that it couldn\u2019t possibly come from the Oval Office,\u201d the Democratic congressman Mike Quigley said to CNN. \u201cIt sounds all the world like the president of the United States, in some sort of momentary lapse, just dictated angrily whatever was on the top of his head.\u201d Quigley, a member of the House intelligence committee, continued: \u201cFor him to write this and to also say that it doesn\u2019t affect us is ignorance at the highest level.\u201d The release of the letter came on the heels of an overwhelming House vote to condemn Trump\u2019s troop withdrawal from Syria. \u201cToday in the House, we voted 354-60 to condemn Trump\u2019s actions with regard to Syria,\u201d the Democratic congressman Mike Levin said on Twitter. \u201cAlso, this letter is an embarrassment to the office.\u201d It also came out on the day of a heated White House meeting that ended with Trump allegedly calling the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, a \u201cthird-rate politician\u201d and Pelosi saying: \u201cI pray for the president all the time \u2026 I think now we have to pray for his health \u2013 this was a very serious meltdown on the part of the president.\u201d Trump reportedly handed out copies of the letter at the meeting. The letter was quickly parodied. On Wednesday, Trump also hailed his own decision to withdraw US troops from Syria as strategically brilliant and declared the Kurds were \u201cmuch safer now\u201d, contradicting the official assessment of both the state and defense departments that the Turkish offensive was a disaster for regional stability and the fight against Isis. Former officials said the most significant point about the letter was Trump\u2019s readiness to share a supposedly confidential letter from the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) leader, Mazloum Kobani, with Erdo\u011fan, whose forces were launching an attack on the SDF. \u201cGeneral Mazloum is willing to negotiate with you, and he is willing to make concessions that they would never have made in the past. I am confidentially enclosing a copy of his letter to me, just received,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cThese words on White House stationary [sic] should embarrass all Americans, but Trump\u2019s \u2018confidential\u2019 enclosure of the SDF commander\u2019s letter will give our allies even less reason to trust America,\u201d said Ned Price, a former CIA officer and National Security Council spokesman. \u201cHow much Nato correspondence has been forwarded to Putin?\u201d Julian Borger contributed reporting",

      "body": "<p>Parenting \u2013 whether you are a birth or adoptive parent \u2013 is wonderful but isn\u2019t easy. \u201cWhen your child is crying at 4am, you have to get up and do your best to comfort and reassure them,\u201d says Mark Owers, an adoptive parent and government adviser on adoption. \u201cAdoption is amazing but of course some families experience more difficulties than others,\u201d he says, \u201cand that\u2019s why having the right kind of support at the right time is so important.\u201d</p> <p>Owers recently carried out an adoption support audit for the government and chairs the steering group for national adopter recruitment.</p> <p>\u201cAll adoption agencies are committed to ensuring that families who adopt know that support is readily available,\u201d he says. Lifelong support is critical and it is available from the first time you contact an agency, but adoptive families are free to seek help on their own terms. \u201cSupport should be there when adopters need it, and they should expect to need it,\u201d he adds.</p> <p>One of the things that prospective adopters sometimes fear is the assessment process. But Owers counters this. \u201cAssessment needs to be rigorous. These are some of the country\u2019s most vulnerable children.\u201d But he believes that prospective adopters need to be considered using a \u201cstrengths-based approach\u201d, looking at what they can offer and identifying areas for development and support. The social worker, he says, is responsible for helping people to use the assessment process to learn about themselves and jointly identify a workable support plan for both themselves and their child.</p> <p>Jo and her wife, Mandy, adopted twice; their sons are now five and eight.</p> <p>\u201cWe had an amazing social worker. There was a lot of continuity and I feel very grateful about that,\u201d says Jo. Their social worker was a source of support to the couple throughout the emotional rollercoaster of both adoptions. \u201cShe found us both our sons and was always there without judgment.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/you-can-adopt/2019/oct/14/olympian-tessa-sanderson-on-why-she-adopted-and-the-need-for-more-bame-adoptive-parents\">Olympian Tessa Sanderson on why she adopted \u2013 and the need for more BAME adoptive parents</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Owers says that adopters are also offered support to ensure that they are best able to meet their child\u2019s needs. For instance, Jo and Mandy\u2019s social worker sent them on courses \u2013 such as one on adopting a second child. Other agencies offered sessions in the early evening, giving information on subjects such as brain-based trauma.</p> <p>He stresses the importance of peer support, with parents learning from each other. Jo is an adoption mentor, available to talk informally to people who are considering adoption. She also <a href=\"https://ninjamam.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">blogs regularly</a> about her experience of parenting and is part of several closed Facebook groups that offer peer support to people adopting or fostering.</p> <p>Therapeutic parenting courses are also available to help adopters understand how children\u2019s experiences prior to being adopted might influence their behaviour. \u201cThese help adoptive families understand their children\u2019s needs,\u201d says Owers. \u201cChildren who have experienced trauma in their lives have brains that are \u2018wired differently\u2019.\u201d The process of sanctions and rewards \u2013 commonly used by parents and teachers \u2013 does not work for a child who has experienced developmental trauma. Instead, therapeutic parenting focuses on empathy, nurturing and playfulness. \u201cIt goes against the grain, but therapeutic parenting absolutely works,\u201d Owers concludes.</p> <p>Another concern for many adoptive parents is school, and the extent to which schools do or do not understand the needs of adopted children. When Jo and Mandy\u2019s eldest son, who was adopted as a toddler, started school, physical and emotional issues that had not appeared before started to show.</p> <p>\u201cWe started to realise he had attachment disorder and sensory issues,\u201d Jo says. But the school helped, and Jo describes the special educational needs coordinator as brilliant. \u201cWe were supported from day one,\u201d she continues.</p> <p>For families who adopt children with additional needs, then a range of therapeutic services is also available without the long waits many other children experience from health services.</p> <p>This support can often be paid for by the Adoption and Special Guardianship Support Fund (<a href=\"https://www.first4adoption.org.uk/adoption-support/\" rel=\"nofollow\">ASF</a>). The ASF provides funds to adoption agencies to pay for essential therapeutic services, which tens of thousands of families have found invaluable since its launch in May 2015. The Department for Education is funding this scheme until <a href=\"https://www.adoptionuk.org/Pages/FAQs/Category/adoption-support-fund\" rel=\"nofollow\">at least 2021</a>.</p> <p>Claire is a single adoptive parent whose two daughters both have foetal alcohol syndrome. Her older daughter, Annie, was hugely sensitive to noise and was self-harming. \u201cThe ASF is a lifeline for parents,\u201d she says. \u201cThere were things she needed that were not available on the NHS, not to the level that she needed anyway.\u201d</p> <p>Claire was able to access an occupational therapist through the ASF for Annie when she was two years old. The therapist helped her with her sensory issues and with her strength and dexterity.</p> <p>\u201cIt was the best thing we\u2019ve ever done \u2013 for both Annie and me. It has massively improved our lives. It has helped me to understand how her brain works and what she needs. She\u2019s a very clever child but the outside world doesn\u2019t work for her.</p> <p>\u201cWithout this help, I would not have been able to adopt another child,\u201d Claire continues. She is now accessing help for her younger daughter too, who has physiological issues that were not obvious initially. \u201c[Lucy] is more medically complicated but easier to parent,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Whatever the challenges, both Jo and Claire are hugely positive about adopting.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve changed as a person,\u201d says Jo. \u201cAdoption changed my life, gave me two amazing boys, gave me more confidence, a passion. You never forget they are adopted but they are ours.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>If you are interested in finding out more about adoption, contact First4Adoption on 0300 222 0022 or visit <a href=\"https://www.first4adoption.org.uk/youcanadopt/\" rel=\"nofollow\">first4adoption.org.uk/youcanadopt</a></strong></em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Parenting \u2013 whether you are a birth or adoptive parent \u2013 is wonderful but isn\u2019t easy. \u201cWhen your child is crying at 4am, you have to get up and do your best to comfort and reassure them,\u201d says Mark Owers, an adoptive parent and government adviser on adoption. \u201cAdoption is amazing but of course some families experience more difficulties than others,\u201d he says, \u201cand that\u2019s why having the right kind of support at the right time is so important.\u201d Owers recently carried out an adoption support audit for the government and chairs the steering group for national adopter recruitment. \u201cAll adoption agencies are committed to ensuring that families who adopt know that support is readily available,\u201d he says. Lifelong support is critical and it is available from the first time you contact an agency, but adoptive families are free to seek help on their own terms. \u201cSupport should be there when adopters need it, and they should expect to need it,\u201d he adds. One of the things that prospective adopters sometimes fear is the assessment process. But Owers counters this. \u201cAssessment needs to be rigorous. These are some of the country\u2019s most vulnerable children.\u201d But he believes that prospective adopters need to be considered using a \u201cstrengths-based approach\u201d, looking at what they can offer and identifying areas for development and support. The social worker, he says, is responsible for helping people to use the assessment process to learn about themselves and jointly identify a workable support plan for both themselves and their child. Jo and her wife, Mandy, adopted twice; their sons are now five and eight. \u201cWe had an amazing social worker. There was a lot of continuity and I feel very grateful about that,\u201d says Jo. Their social worker was a source of support to the couple throughout the emotional rollercoaster of both adoptions. \u201cShe found us both our sons and was always there without judgment.\u201d Owers says that adopters are also offered support to ensure that they are best able to meet their child\u2019s needs. For instance, Jo and Mandy\u2019s social worker sent them on courses \u2013 such as one on adopting a second child. Other agencies offered sessions in the early evening, giving information on subjects such as brain-based trauma. He stresses the importance of peer support, with parents learning from each other. Jo is an adoption mentor, available to talk informally to people who are considering adoption. She also blogs regularly about her experience of parenting and is part of several closed Facebook groups that offer peer support to people adopting or fostering. Therapeutic parenting courses are also available to help adopters understand how children\u2019s experiences prior to being adopted might influence their behaviour. \u201cThese help adoptive families understand their children\u2019s needs,\u201d says Owers. \u201cChildren who have experienced trauma in their lives have brains that are \u2018wired differently\u2019.\u201d The process of sanctions and rewards \u2013 commonly used by parents and teachers \u2013 does not work for a child who has experienced developmental trauma. Instead, therapeutic parenting focuses on empathy, nurturing and playfulness. \u201cIt goes against the grain, but therapeutic parenting absolutely works,\u201d Owers concludes. Another concern for many adoptive parents is school, and the extent to which schools do or do not understand the needs of adopted children. When Jo and Mandy\u2019s eldest son, who was adopted as a toddler, started school, physical and emotional issues that had not appeared before started to show. \u201cWe started to realise he had attachment disorder and sensory issues,\u201d Jo says. But the school helped, and Jo describes the special educational needs coordinator as brilliant. \u201cWe were supported from day one,\u201d she continues. For families who adopt children with additional needs, then a range of therapeutic services is also available without the long waits many other children experience from health services. This support can often be paid for by the Adoption and Special Guardianship Support Fund (ASF). The ASF provides funds to adoption agencies to pay for essential therapeutic services, which tens of thousands of families have found invaluable since its launch in May 2015. The Department for Education is funding this scheme until at least 2021. Claire is a single adoptive parent whose two daughters both have foetal alcohol syndrome. Her older daughter, Annie, was hugely sensitive to noise and was self-harming. \u201cThe ASF is a lifeline for parents,\u201d she says. \u201cThere were things she needed that were not available on the NHS, not to the level that she needed anyway.\u201d Claire was able to access an occupational therapist through the ASF for Annie when she was two years old. The therapist helped her with her sensory issues and with her strength and dexterity. \u201cIt was the best thing we\u2019ve ever done \u2013 for both Annie and me. It has massively improved our lives. It has helped me to understand how her brain works and what she needs. She\u2019s a very clever child but the outside world doesn\u2019t work for her. \u201cWithout this help, I would not have been able to adopt another child,\u201d Claire continues. She is now accessing help for her younger daughter too, who has physiological issues that were not obvious initially. \u201c[Lucy] is more medically complicated but easier to parent,\u201d she says. Whatever the challenges, both Jo and Claire are hugely positive about adopting. \u201cI\u2019ve changed as a person,\u201d says Jo. \u201cAdoption changed my life, gave me two amazing boys, gave me more confidence, a passion. You never forget they are adopted but they are ours.\u201d If you are interested in finding out more about adoption, contact First4Adoption on 0300 222 0022 or visit first4adoption.org.uk/youcanadopt",

      "bodyText": "The multibillion-pound expansion of Heathrow violates the rights of children and future generations, who will face the greatest impact of the climate crisis, lawyers will argue at the court of appeal in London. Fresh legal challenges on Thursday by environmental NGOs, councils and the mayor of London against the construction of a third runway will be presented during a five-day hearing. The high court ruled in spring that the government\u2019s decision to allow a third runway was lawful. Since then, it has signed into law a commitment for the country to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. The Committee on Climate Change, the government\u2019s statutory adviser, previously warned aviation was likely to be the biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the UK by then. Lawyers will argue for the first time that the rights of children were not taken into account by the government when it approved the third runway. The court has allowed the World Wide Fund for Nature to submit documents arguing the planned expansion violates the rights of future generations under the UN convention on the rights of the child. The intervention by WWF comes after young people spearheaded the biggest climate change protest in history last month, and follows Greta Thunberg\u2019s challenge to world leaders that their inaction was letting down a generation. Debbie Tripley, WWF\u2019s director of environmental policy, said: \u201cChildren have a right to have a voice in this \u2026 particularly where there is very clearly a disproportionate burden that will fall on them in relation to future climate impacts.\u201d The shadow chancellor said campaigners against the new runway were on the verge of victory. Speaking after a rally outside the court, John McDonnell said: \u201cLast time we were in court the government had not just legislated in the Paris agreement, and parliament had not just agreed we were in a climate emergency. \u201cSo I think legislatively things have moved and politically, with the current campaigning by Extinction Rebellion, the pressure is on all politicians to recognise this is a project that cannot stand.\u201d Friends of the Earth, which is leading the challenge on climate grounds, said since the previous court hearing in March, many things had changed. \u201cThe government has legislated for net-zero carbon emissions under the Climate Change Act, which our client believes would have almost no chance of being met if the expansion of Heathrow was to go ahead,\u201d said Rowan Smith, a lawyer at Leigh Day representing Friends of the Earth. \u201cIt gives further weight to our client\u2019s arguments that the expansion goes against the government\u2019s own climate change goals.\u201d Will Rundle, the head of legal affairs at Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cThe government has admitted that it did not consider the Paris agreement when agreeing to Heathrow expansion. We hope the court of appeal now agrees with us that this is not sustainable development and ignores the needs of future generations.\u201d An additional runway would put a further 700 planes in the air each day \u2013 a 50% rise on the current traffic in and out of the airport. A coalition of local authorities \u2013 Wandsworth, Richmond upon Thames, Hillingdon, Hammersmith and Fulham \u2013 joined by the mayor and Greenpeace, will argue the government\u2019s decision to approve the expansion was flawed because ministers failed to properly consider the full impact on noise levels, health and the environment. A decision is expected in December. Ravi Govindia, the leader of Wandsworth council, said: \u201cThe third runway will have devastating consequences for the health of Londoners. It is also becoming clearer by the day that expansion will play havoc with the government\u2019s zero carbon targets.\u201d In documents published as part of the consultation process, Heathrow said it should \u201cnot come at any cost\u201d. The airport outlined plans for low-emissions zones and congestion charges to stem local air pollution. The proposals involve a phased expansion up to 2050, with terminal buildings added after the runway as passenger numbers reach 140 million a year. The M25, Britain\u2019s busiest motorway, will be moved up to 150 metres west and run through a tunnel under the new runway and taxiways. A temporary bridge across the motorway will be built for construction vehicles. Heathrow has said the expansion will cost \u00a314bn but critics suggest the true figure will be close to \u00a330bn. Boris Johnson, who threatened to lie in front of the bulldozers, has said he will watch the legal challenges with a lively interest.",

I\u2019ve got huge admiration for them and wanted to become champion. Now I\u2019ve done it I want to do it again. Money doesn\u2019t motivate me in any way. I just want to win many championships.\u201d</p> <p>Murphy smiles on a crisp and sunlit morning in Newmarket as he compares himself to racing\u2019s most famous champion who will turn 49 in December. \u201cI\u2019ve won 13 Group Ones. Frankie Dettori has won well over 200 Group Ones. I think he\u2019s ridden 17 this year. That\u2019s phenomenal. I\u2019ll never get to his level. At 24, Frankie was streets above where I am now.\u201d</p> <p>He leans forward to stress his enthusiasm. \u201cI still idolise Frankie Dettori. I actually named my dog Frankie. I never told Frankie about the dog but we get on really well. We just have to try and avoid each other because we\u2019re too mad together.</p> <p>\u201cI really look up to him but when I was a kid I wasn\u2019t allowed to. My grandad said I couldn\u2019t because his favourite rider was Timmy Murphy [the Irish jockey then known for his exploits over jumps].\u201d</p> <p>Dettori steadied Murphy during the young Irishman\u2019s slump this summer \u2013 soon after he got into trouble after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/16/oisin-murphy-salisbury-breath-test--royal-ascot\" title=\"\">failing a breath test in June</a>. \u201cMay was going supremely well.\u201d Murphy says. \u201cI had a really good week and I was excited about Royal Ascot. I had more rides there than everybody except Frankie and Ryan Moore. I thought I had some genuine chances. Then came a massive reality check.\u201d</p> <p>On 16 June, Murphy\u2019s breath test reading was <a href=\"http://judicialpanel.britishhorseracing.com/results/result/?id=1926\" title=\"\">well under the drink-driving limit</a> but he still exceeded the accepted limit for drinking as a jockey and Murphy does not attempt to excuse himself.</p> <p>\u201cIt was my fault,\u201d he says of a misdemeanour that cost him a day\u2019s racing at Salisbury. \u201cIf you\u2019re dehydrated the day before and you consume alcohol, don\u2019t go to bed on time, don\u2019t hydrate the next day and don\u2019t eat anything, you\u2019re in trouble.\u201d</p> <p>Did the failed test affect his racing? \u201cYes. It was going round in my mind that I missed three winners that Sunday. You\u2019re thinking: \u2018If I lose the championship by three winners then it\u2019s my fault.\u2019 All the trainers I ride for texted me and I rang Sheikh Fahad as I\u2019m the retained jockey for Qatar Racing. Everyone was really supportive. But it was so embarrassing. Even now I\u2019m ashamed of it.\u201d</p> <p>He allowed that season low to knock him off kilter. \u201cI went from about 12 in front to about 12 behind. I was getting on favourites but my instinct and feel had gone and they weren\u2019t winning. So you get in that rut and you overthink it.</p> <p>\u201cBut there was a turning point. In late July things started to pick up. Frankie won the Irish Oaks on Star Catcher. I texted him after the race and he said: \u2018Thanks kiddo. Remember I want you to be champion jockey. Forget about the numbers at the moment. Start riding off instinct. I believe in you.\u2019 So the next fortnight I did not look at the championship table. I had the strength not to do it. I was one or two in front and then I got four winners. I had that belief back.\u201d</p> <p>After 166 victories this season Murphy is <a href=\"https://www.thepja.co.uk/championships/flat-jockeys-championship/\" title=\"\">33 clear</a> of the runner-up, Danny Tudhope, and 69 ahead of Crowley in third place. It feels as if it is the start of a new championship reign \u2013 as well as the culmination of a long journey. When he was a boy Murphy wanted to become a champion show-jumper and because many of the best riders in that sport were based in Germany he worked hard and learned German. But his life changed when he finally sat on a racehorse for the first time, at the age of 14.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d2392d4dc507a915e6ebda1b8500177546f8f06f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2392d4dc507a915e6ebda1b8500177546f8f06f/0_0_3500_2338/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Benbatl, ridden by Oisin Murphy, wins the Shadwell Joel Stakes at Newmarket in September.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Benbatl, ridden by Oisin Murphy, wins the Shadwell Joel Stakes at Newmarket in September.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nigel French/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His uncle, Jim Culloty, had won the Grand National and the Gold Cup and he was merciless in dissecting Murphy\u2019s technique. \u201cIn Ireland we have pony and horse races \u2013 it depends on the course. We call them flappers and normally the big races are over two miles. They\u2019re actual racehorses, ridden by children, so you develop fantastic horsemanship skills but also lots of bad habits. Like interference-wise. It becomes competitive. The falls can be bad and the tracks are tight. I had a couple of concussions.</p> <p>\u201cMost Irish boys will start riding racehorses aged 10. I was 14. It didn\u2019t come naturally. I remember watching the video replays with my uncle and he made me cry because I was really bad.\u201d</p> <p>Murphy points out that Fallon was much older than him when he first got on a horse. Fallon became a six-times champion jockey and after Murphy began racing seriously in England in 2013 the veteran often put his fellow Irishman in his place. \u201cOh yeah,\u201d Murphy says amid much laughter. \u201cNumerous times. It\u2019s a bit different now and interference rules are stricter. When I started, if a senior jockey wanted your position, he just took it.</p> <p>\u201cI love riding for Hughesie [Richard Hughes, the former champion jockey turned trainer] now. But he taught me some lessons. I used to float up into second or third place and Hughesie would decide: \u2018Oh, I\u2019d like to be right where Oisin is now.\u2019 He wouldn\u2019t say anything. He\u2019d just manoeuvre himself into position and push me out the way.\u201d</p> <p>Would someone as feisty as, say Fallon, take it out on Murphy afterwards? \u201cOh no. He\u2019s actually very good to me. Often he would encourage you. He\u2019s a good person.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/30/kieran-fallon-interview-horse-racing\" title=\"\">I like Fallon too</a> but I have heard he once knocked Murphy down in the weighing room. \u201cKieren Fallon never punched me. He never laid a finger on me. Other jockeys did. They would get physical.\u201d</p> <p>Murphy is almost amused that he took a few punches from older jockeys. \u201cI was probably a little cheeky. I suppose I still am \u2013 but nobody would punch me now. If a young lad rides badly in a race, it\u2019s my job to discipline him. But you achieve a lot more saying something quietly, and explaining what was wrong, than losing the plot.\u201d</p> <p>Murphy rejects the claim the weighing room is much more cut\u2011throat on the Flat than in the less lucrative world of jump racing. \u201cI can\u2019t have that. You wouldn\u2019t find a closer-knit weighing room than ours at the moment. James Doyle, Harry Bentley, Andrea Atzeni, Luke Morris, Silvestre de Sousa and I hang out very often. I get on with all the apprentices. I\u2019m not in the jump jockey\u2019s weighing room but they all work in the same yards and try to steal each other\u2019s rides. As Flat jockeys we all have our own jobs.\u201d</p> <p>His relationship with Dettori was evident again when the Italian was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/06/enable-foiled-by-waldgeist-in-bid-for-third-prix-de-larc-de-triomphe-horse-racing\" title=\"\">disappointed not to win the Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe</a> for a third year in a row this month. \u201cI tried to help before and after. Before the race he was nervous so I tried to calm him down. I got him joking a bit. So he was fine. In the race he sat even further back than he would have done normally, the pace was strong and, on slow ground, it turned into a war of attrition. The strongest stayer [Waldgeist] won. We just had to accept that. The best horse in the race doesn\u2019t always win.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c96da69d6e976722eae6d1429d2f056081cf7eab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c96da69d6e976722eae6d1429d2f056081cf7eab/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Murphy chats with Frankie Dettori as they leave the weighing room at Sandown Park.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Murphy chats with Frankie Dettori as they leave the weighing room at Sandown Park.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alan Crowhurst/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Is Dettori the best jockey Murphy has raced against? \u201cYip. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/29/ryan-moore-air-force-blue-2000-guineas\" title=\"\">Ryan Moore\u2019s very good</a> but I love the way Frankie rides.

In 2018 Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld disappeared as a result.</p>\n    <p>In terms of habits, shoppers are switching to buying online. The likes of Amazon have an unfair advantage because they have a lower business rate bill, which holds down costs and enables online retailers to woo shoppers with low prices. Business rates are taxes, based on the value of commercial property, that are imposed on traditional retailers with physical stores.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>At the same time, there is a move away from buying \u2018stuff\u2019 as more people live in smaller homes and rent rather than buy. Those pressures have come just as rising labour and product costs, partly fuelled by Brexit, have coincided with economic and political uncertainty that has dampened consumer confidence.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What help do retailers need?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Retailers with a high-street presence want the government to change business rates. They also want more political certainty as the potential for a no deal Brexit means some are not only incurring additional costs for stockpiling goods but are unsure about the impact of tariffs after October 2019. Retailers also want more investment in town centres to help them adapt to changing trends, as well as a cut to high parking charges which they say put off shoppers.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the government doing?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In the October 2018 budget the government announced&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/26/budget-to-offer-business-rates-relief-for-small-shops\">some relief</a>&nbsp;on business rates for independent shopkeepers. It has also set up a \u00a3675m \u2018future high streets\u2019 fund under which local councils can bid for up to \u00a325m towards regeneration projects such as refurbishing local historic buildings and improving transport links. The fund will also pay for the creation of a high street taskforce to provide expertise and hands-on support to local areas.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the outlook in 2019?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Some retailers could go under. Weakened by a difficult Christmas \u2013 which accounts for the entire annual profits of many retailers, and with further Brexit wobbles to come \u2013 retailers are facing a tough 2019. Another rise in the national minimum wage in April and the falling value of the pound against the dollar, which is used to buy goods in the far east, have also added to costs and hit profits.</p>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Ruth Gregory, a UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said there was little evidence of shoppers stockpiling goods ahead of a possible no-deal Brexit on 31 October.</p> \n<p>\u201cSeptember\u2019s retail sales figures were perhaps a bit of a relief given the intense Brexit uncertainty, but were hardly a picture of strength,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said there was still some momentum in consumers\u2019 spending, which would provide some support for GDP growth while many other parts of the economy are either stagnant or in decline.</p> \n<p>\u201cLooking ahead, slowdowns in both employment and wage growth look set to hinder growth in spending.

The volume of sales was flat and the value down by 0.2% in September with a further slump in department store sales offsetting a modest rise in clothing and supermarket food purchases, according to the Office for National Statistics. Drivers also cut back on buying fuel while online shoppers reined in their spending, possibly keeping their powder dry for Black Friday at the end of November. But it was the dearth of spending on furniture and white goods that meant retail sales stagnated last month following a drop in the volume of goods bought in August.

      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.kathleenjamie.com/\">Kathleen Jamie</a> recently spent \u201cvaluable minutes\u201d of her life totting up all the books and authors who have been shortlisted for the prestigious <a href=\"https://wainwrightprize.com/\">Wainwright prize</a> for British nature and travel writing. The tally is 26 books by men and 14 by women. For winners, the ratio is five men to one woman.</p> <p>Jamie \u2013 a poet whose genre-stretching first book of essays, 2005\u2019s Findings, was a much-praised widening of the growing field of nature writing \u2013 is aghast at the preponderance of male nature writers. \u201cOnly 15 years ago,\u201d she says when I meet her in her home city of Edinburgh, \u201cnature writing was barely there. It seems very strange that this thing that barely existed can suddenly ignite. I hate to say it, but it has been colonised \u2013 by middle-class white men. I\u2019m interested in how that\u2019s happened. And if you understand how that\u2019s happened, you understand the whole godforsaken political state of this country.\u201d The cafe table is being softly thumped. </p> <p>Jamie, whose new collection of essays, Surfacing, has just been published, is not a sore loser. She has never been nominated for the Wainwright because the prize wasn\u2019t set up when her previous book, Sightlines, was published in 2012. And she\u2019s won <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/kathleen-jamie\">a bundle of awards</a> over the course of her career, which began before university when she deposited a sheaf of poems on a publisher\u2019s doorstep and saw them published in 1982. But she\u2019s keenly observant not just of the male character of much nature writing but also of its middle and upper-class provenance. \u201cPoetry has got much greater diversity, by a long shot \u2026 So why is that? Is it related to land and ownership? Abso-bloody-lutely.\u201d</p> <p>Despite not hailing from a literary family, Jamie found her voice early. Her father was an accountant and her mother, a solicitor\u2019s clerk, usually had a thriller on the go but Jamie was more inspired by her local library \u2013 and punk. \u201cI was 15 in 1977 so you couldn\u2019t avoid it. There was an energy to it that was very attractive.\u201d Did that sensibility stay with you? \u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p> <p>She began writing poetry at school (\u201cAye,\u201d she says dismissively, \u201clike most poets\u201d) after she read one poet and thought she could do better. It is typical of Jamie that she still won\u2019t name this poet. </p> <p>John Berger called Jamie <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/apr/06/kathleen-jamie-life-in-writing\">\u201ca sorceress of the essay form\u201d</a> and, like her previous works, Surfacing is rich in connections and observations that grant the reader new ways of seeing \u2013 from the archeological bones that look \u201clike broken biscuits\u201d in their museum tin, to the Orkney bull \u201clost in his bull\u2019s dream\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cI did a long apprenticeship as a poet before I turned to non-fiction. People always say, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s astonishing.\u2019 No, it\u2019s not \u2013 just read poetry. It\u2019s all in there. Mine and everybody else\u2019s.\u201d But, I can\u2019t help wondering, where does her simile-making come from? \u201cI don\u2019t know. I love it. I\u2019m not always aware of it. If I\u2019m writing something and it just comes out of the tip of the pen, I go, \u2018Yes!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Jamie\u2019s poetry offers a vivid take on familiar nature. There are mating frogs interrupted by a passing car that crushes them \u201cinto one \u2013 belly / to belly, tongue thrust utterly into soft brain\u201d. And the swaying seaweed and jellyfish like \u201clost internal organs\u201d that are visible from a glass-bottomed boat. </p> <p>To such immaculate small portraits, Surfacing adds the same big themes of global heating and deep time that were tackled this year by the other leading voice in contemporary nature writing, Robert Macfarlane. Once criticised for being escapist, <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2015/06/death-naturalist-why-new-nature-writing-so-tame\">apolitical literature of consolation</a>, nature writing is now grappling with the epic challenges of the Anthropocene, in Jamie\u2019s case via visits to archeological digs in Alaska and Orkney, where ancient settlements have been revealed by climate-induced erosion.</p> <p>Like her previous books, Surfacing is a collection of what at first appear to be disparate essays. Jamie excavates long-forgotten memories in some, and then writes of two very different digs in northern lands that are as stark and beautiful as any nature writing but also witty and well-peopled \u2013 qualities less typical of the genre. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9284c6b4dc9fa251d56be15a5394502b6619994a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9284c6b4dc9fa251d56be15a5394502b6619994a/0_0_7474_9407/795.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018The land is being swallowed up so fast\u2019 \u2026 whalebones doubling as a clothes hanger at the Quinhagak Archaeological Project in Alaska, visited by Kathleen Jamie.\" width=\"795\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The land is being swallowed up so fast\u2019 \u2026 whalebones doubling as a clothes hanger at the Quinhagak Archaeological Project in Alaska, visited by Kathleen Jamie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Erika Larsen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Alaskan people are experiencing the climate crisis more dramatically than most of us. \u201cThey are moving the entire village I visited because the land is being swallowed up so fast. The tundra is catching fire, which they\u2019ve never seen before. People who for many thousands of years were living with snow and ice have no snow and ice.\u201d</p> <p>The climate crisis, says Jamie, \u201cinevitably sends you back into the further reaches of time. I\u2019m not knowledgeable about proper deep, geological time. My work is only concerned with 8,000 years, which is nothing.\u201d As she writes in Surfacing, today\u2019s global heating is a mere \u201cwarm bank holiday weekend\u201d.</p> <p>Jamie is not a polemicist but hopes that her writing raises questions. She does not like the \u201cnature writing\u201d label. \u201cPublishers and bookshops want a wee ticket to put on it. That\u2019s not serving us well.\u201d</p> <p>But she believes such writing can provide an alternative to mega-consumption. \u201cI would like to think of nature writing as a nice little retreat. I don\u2019t want it to be on the frontline. I want routes not to the barricades but to a more thoughtful way, a kinder way \u2013 more compassionate to ourselves and other creatures. \u201cI\u2019m not an activist. Maybe I ought to be but it\u2019s really not where my talent lies. An activist knows what they want and they work out how to get it. More \u2018creative\u2019 people like me have no idea what we want until it\u2019s done.\u201d</p> <p>Writing her essay collections is like this, says Jamie: she does not plan particular \u201ctopics\u201d \u2013 she almost spits out the word \u2013 but lets themes emerge instead. \u201cThere\u2019s a point working on something when things start to cohere. It\u2019s a bit like scrambled egg. It starts off as liquid in a pan and then it begins to clump. At some holistic moment, which is very rare and very lovely, you think, \u2018Oh yes, that\u2019s come together.\u2019 And all you have to do is write it. That doesn\u2019t happen very often.\u201d</p> <p>Findings touched on her life as a busy mother of young children. In Surfacing, those children have left home \u2013 and old memories resurface.

      "bodyText": "Kathleen Jamie recently spent \u201cvaluable minutes\u201d of her life totting up all the books and authors who have been shortlisted for the prestigious Wainwright prize for British nature and travel writing. The tally is 26 books by men and 14 by women. For winners, the ratio is five men to one woman. Jamie \u2013 a poet whose genre-stretching first book of essays, 2005\u2019s Findings, was a much-praised widening of the growing field of nature writing \u2013 is aghast at the preponderance of male nature writers. \u201cOnly 15 years ago,\u201d she says when I meet her in her home city of Edinburgh, \u201cnature writing was barely there. It seems very strange that this thing that barely existed can suddenly ignite. I hate to say it, but it has been colonised \u2013 by middle-class white men. I\u2019m interested in how that\u2019s happened. And if you understand how that\u2019s happened, you understand the whole godforsaken political state of this country.\u201d The cafe table is being softly thumped. Jamie, whose new collection of essays, Surfacing, has just been published, is not a sore loser. She has never been nominated for the Wainwright because the prize wasn\u2019t set up when her previous book, Sightlines, was published in 2012. And she\u2019s won a bundle of awards over the course of her career, which began before university when she deposited a sheaf of poems on a publisher\u2019s doorstep and saw them published in 1982. But she\u2019s keenly observant not just of the male character of much nature writing but also of its middle and upper-class provenance. \u201cPoetry has got much greater diversity, by a long shot \u2026 So why is that? Is it related to land and ownership? Abso-bloody-lutely.\u201d Despite not hailing from a literary family, Jamie found her voice early. Her father was an accountant and her mother, a solicitor\u2019s clerk, usually had a thriller on the go but Jamie was more inspired by her local library \u2013 and punk. \u201cI was 15 in 1977 so you couldn\u2019t avoid it. There was an energy to it that was very attractive.\u201d Did that sensibility stay with you? \u201cDefinitely.\u201d She began writing poetry at school (\u201cAye,\u201d she says dismissively, \u201clike most poets\u201d) after she read one poet and thought she could do better. It is typical of Jamie that she still won\u2019t name this poet. John Berger called Jamie \u201ca sorceress of the essay form\u201d and, like her previous works, Surfacing is rich in connections and observations that grant the reader new ways of seeing \u2013 from the archeological bones that look \u201clike broken biscuits\u201d in their museum tin, to the Orkney bull \u201clost in his bull\u2019s dream\u201d. \u201cI did a long apprenticeship as a poet before I turned to non-fiction. People always say, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s astonishing.\u2019 No, it\u2019s not \u2013 just read poetry. It\u2019s all in there. Mine and everybody else\u2019s.\u201d But, I can\u2019t help wondering, where does her simile-making come from? \u201cI don\u2019t know. I love it. I\u2019m not always aware of it. If I\u2019m writing something and it just comes out of the tip of the pen, I go, \u2018Yes!\u2019\u201d Jamie\u2019s poetry offers a vivid take on familiar nature. There are mating frogs interrupted by a passing car that crushes them \u201cinto one \u2013 belly / to belly, tongue thrust utterly into soft brain\u201d. And the swaying seaweed and jellyfish like \u201clost internal organs\u201d that are visible from a glass-bottomed boat. To such immaculate small portraits, Surfacing adds the same big themes of global heating and deep time that were tackled this year by the other leading voice in contemporary nature writing, Robert Macfarlane. Once criticised for being escapist, apolitical literature of consolation, nature writing is now grappling with the epic challenges of the Anthropocene, in Jamie\u2019s case via visits to archeological digs in Alaska and Orkney, where ancient settlements have been revealed by climate-induced erosion. Like her previous books, Surfacing is a collection of what at first appear to be disparate essays. Jamie excavates long-forgotten memories in some, and then writes of two very different digs in northern lands that are as stark and beautiful as any nature writing but also witty and well-peopled \u2013 qualities less typical of the genre. The Alaskan people are experiencing the climate crisis more dramatically than most of us. \u201cThey are moving the entire village I visited because the land is being swallowed up so fast. The tundra is catching fire, which they\u2019ve never seen before. People who for many thousands of years were living with snow and ice have no snow and ice.\u201d The climate crisis, says Jamie, \u201cinevitably sends you back into the further reaches of time. I\u2019m not knowledgeable about proper deep, geological time. My work is only concerned with 8,000 years, which is nothing.\u201d As she writes in Surfacing, today\u2019s global heating is a mere \u201cwarm bank holiday weekend\u201d. Jamie is not a polemicist but hopes that her writing raises questions. She does not like the \u201cnature writing\u201d label. \u201cPublishers and bookshops want a wee ticket to put on it. That\u2019s not serving us well.\u201d But she believes such writing can provide an alternative to mega-consumption. \u201cI would like to think of nature writing as a nice little retreat. I don\u2019t want it to be on the frontline. I want routes not to the barricades but to a more thoughtful way, a kinder way \u2013 more compassionate to ourselves and other creatures. \u201cI\u2019m not an activist. Maybe I ought to be but it\u2019s really not where my talent lies. An activist knows what they want and they work out how to get it. More \u2018creative\u2019 people like me have no idea what we want until it\u2019s done.\u201d Writing her essay collections is like this, says Jamie: she does not plan particular \u201ctopics\u201d \u2013 she almost spits out the word \u2013 but lets themes emerge instead. \u201cThere\u2019s a point working on something when things start to cohere. It\u2019s a bit like scrambled egg. It starts off as liquid in a pan and then it begins to clump. At some holistic moment, which is very rare and very lovely, you think, \u2018Oh yes, that\u2019s come together.\u2019 And all you have to do is write it. That doesn\u2019t happen very often.\u201d Findings touched on her life as a busy mother of young children. In Surfacing, those children have left home \u2013 and old memories resurface. Women cannot divorce themselves from their life stages, she thinks: \u201cIt\u2019s a bit silly to pretend that the complete chaos of family life is not determining what you can do. What I would like to think I\u2019m doing is insisting on the validity of women\u2019s experience through different phases \u2013 young motherhood, older middle age, hopefully old age \u2013 so you have a sense of a woman\u2019s life and what you might call deep time.\u201d Which returns us to women in nature writing. Many more women have been published recently, with big sellers by Helen Macdonald, Amy Liptrot and Isabella Tree. But Jamie still bemoans the lack of young, poor and non-white nature writers. She believes that they don\u2019t often visit the countryside, but there is still nature in cities. \u201cPeople are just too put upon, downtrodden, frightened, worried [to write],\u201d she says. \u201cSo if you eliminate a whole class, you\u2019re going to eliminate what goes with them \u2013 working-class music, acting, literature \u2013 a citizen\u2019s wage would enable a cultural flourishing, a human flourishing, which is being squeezed out, especially with the younger ones.\u201d Jamie sees hope in both Scotland\u2019s political awakening \u2013 independence will be inevitable with Brexit, she thinks \u2013 and down an alleyway opposite where we chat. \u201cInside that doorway is Canongate Books and they\u2019ve got a new award, the Nan Shepherd, for nature writing by people who don\u2019t see themselves represented. I\u2019ll be really interested to see what comes out of that \u2013 if there is an untapped voice.\u201d That said, she\u2019s still ambivalent about the \u201chorrible business\u201d of being shortlisted for awards. \u201cWho is being served by this?

      "bodyText": "They are garish, faded relics of a time gone by: the towering electrified signs signalling motels, diners, stores and bowling alleys that sprang up across the US in the 20th century. As car culture boomed, brightly lit signs became the advertising method of choice for roadside businesses, with bold colours and cartoon-like graphics competing to grab the attention of passing drivers. Many are now under threat, either too expensive to maintain, destroyed by bad weather or torn down for new developments. However, a passionate following of vintage sign enthusiasts has evolved, with thousands of photos on Instagram using hashtags such as #signhunters, #signmongers and #signspotters. Popular accounts include @everything_signage, whose team of curators shares its favourites with 16,000 followers. The first commercial electric signs used incandescent bulbs, before neon became popular in the 1940s and 50s, and their potential demise has prompted local movements to fight to preserve them as valuable parts of urban architectural history. The San Jose Signs Project, for example, aims to \u201cget the city to acknowledge vintage signs as significant historic resources\u201d. And Debra Jane Seltzer, who has spent 20 years documenting vintage signs in an extensive collection of more than 60,000 photographs on her website Roadside Architecture, says some cities are building sign parks, as a way of conserving them. Below is a selection shared by Instagram\u2019s #signhunters. Guardian Cities brings together the best in urban photography on Instagram at @guardiancities.

      "bodyText": "1) It\u2019s the Rugby World Cup quarter-finals this weekend, and there have been some mighty last-eight clashes down the years. The 2015 match between Scotland and Australia will always be remembered for the controversial penalty that broke Scottish hearts at the death. But the Wallabies\u2019 35-34 win had everything, including interceptions, a rain storm and eight tries. France\u2019s shock win over the All Blacks in 2007 was pretty special too. That win for Les Bleus in front of their home fans comes in at No 7 in this list of most memorable World Cup moments, also starring David Campese, Jonah Lomu and Nelson Mandela. Meanwhile \u2026 who could forget Jason Robinson\u2019s electrifying run and pass to set up Will Greenwood\u2019s try in England\u2019s 2003 quarter-final win over Wales? That same tournament also provided one of the greatest passes the game has ever seen, from Carlos Spencer to send Joe Rococoko over to score for the All Blacks in their last-eight win against South Africa. 2) Typhoon Hagibis may have eased in time for Japan\u2019s breathtaking win over Scotland, but the cancellation of Italy\u2019s match against the All Blacks denied Sergio Parisse his World Cup swansong at the age of 36. No matter, let\u2019s remember the power, the pace and the personality. 3) It\u2019s Manchester United v Liverpool on Sunday, and to whet the appetite here are 10 belters from the past, from a United perspective. Liverpool fans might prefer this compilation of their 10 best Premier League goals at Old Trafford. Danny Murphy features twice! Here Michael Owen and Paul Ince discuss one of football\u2019s great rivalries. 4) What do you do when your teammate makes an interception, spins away from a tackle and bolts 70 yards in the wrong direction towards his own end zone? Drag him down and put the remarkable footage on Twitter of course. 5) If you thought that was strange, check out the dexterity shown by this cartwheeling high school footballer. Simone Biles eat your heart out. And is this the most disrespectful thing you\u2019ve seen on a football field? 6) Eliud Kipchoge broke the two-hour barrier for the marathon on Saturday, and afterwards said \u2018anything is possible\u2019. A day later rigid Brigid Kosgei took 81 seconds off Paula Radcliffe\u2019s world marathon record. Here\u2019s Kipchoge crushing the men\u2019s world record in Berlin last year. And watch some mere mortals trying to keep up with his record pace on a running machine, with disastrous consequences. 7) Let\u2019s hear it for the world conker championships \u2026 Our favourites from below the line last week 1) Henry Olonga belts out This Is \u2018The Moment\u2019 on The Voice (Australia edition). 2) All 38 goals of Hugo S\u00e1nchez\u2019s goals for Real Madrid in the 1989-90 La Liga season were scored with just one touch. 3) With Bathurst approaching, here\u2019s a great insight into the preparation of the big three marques in the lead up to the 1970 race. 4) Free-kick routine? Pah! There\u2019s only one way to score a free-kick. 5) Hornussen \u2013 the sport of, um, Swiss farmers.

      "bodyText": "Ken Wyatt says he\u2019s on the brink of producing a concrete proposal to legislate a voice to parliament, and insists a referendum to recognise Indigenous Australians in the constitution needs to happen before the next federal election. The minister for Indigenous Australians told the ABC on Thursday he was about to take \u201ca series of propositions to do with constitutional recognition, the voice and truth telling\u201d to Scott Morrison, and he planned to meet with other Indigenous parliamentarians next week to try and achieve consensus. Wyatt said he had not convinced Indigenous leaders to accept a legislated voice to parliament instead of a constitutionally enshrined representative body, which was the proposal from the Uluru statement. But he said bringing forward a proposal would \u201cstart a process\u201d. Asked whether failing to pursue the voice model outlined in the Uluru statement would break a lot of hearts, Wyatt said \u201cwe have to be pragmatic and that\u2019s a reality\u201d. The minister said a referendum on recognising Indigenous people in the constitution needed to happen before the next federal election because it was \u201cimportant we have this pristine space in which the question can be put\u201d. He said putting the recognition question at the election could have unintended consequences. Wyatt said the precise form of Indigenous recognition in the constitution, the wording, would be \u201cworked through with our people\u201d but it should not foster division in the community. The Liberal senator Andrew Bragg \u2013 who has been a stronger supporter of Wyatt\u2019s efforts \u2013 has argued an Indigenous voice to parliament should be formed by a network of Indigenous communities across the country, in a \u201cbottom-up\u201d approach that would ensure First Nation voices had a direct say to parliament. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In a speech at the beginning of the month, Bragg proposed a voice to parliament building on the \u201cSpeaking for Country\u201d model put forward in a paper written by the former chair of the government\u2019s Indigenous advisory council Warren Mundine. Under this proposal, once the local groups had been formed, the various bodies would then voluntarily affiliate to create a national body that would facilitate communication between the national parliament and government and the local Indigenous peoples. Wyatt appeared to echo that proposal on Thursday when he signalled the model he was working on would roll in pre-existing representatives bodies in the regions. The former chief justice Murray Gleeson has argued \u201ca constitutionally entrenched but legislatively controlled\u201d capacity for Indigenous people to have input into the making of laws about Indigenous people or Indigenous affairs should not be a controversial idea. But a move by Wyatt earlier in this year to put the voice back on the national agenda sparked an immediate backlash inside the government, with conservatives resisting the proposal even if the voice sat outside the constitution. Liberal Craig Kelly told Guardian Australia setting up separate structures, even if the representative model was legislated, risked creating \u201ca reverse form of what South Africa was a few years ago\u201d.",

There is currently a drip, drip of stories coming out about Labour MPs being \u201ctriggered\u201d. Louise Ellman, who quit the party yesterday citing alleged antisemitism, was one such MP widely expected to meet that fate. But the reality is that, far from facilitating a Corbynite takeover, the trigger-ballot battles taking place across the country have allowed the Labour leader\u2019s critics to come out largely unscathed and better organised than ever.</p> <p>In the summer, ahead of a likely early general election, the party began its <a href=\"https://labourlist.org/2019/08/how-labours-trigger-ballot-system-works/\" title=\"\">trigger-ballot process</a>.

There is currently a drip, drip of stories coming out about Labour MPs being \u201ctriggered\u201d. Louise Ellman, who quit the party yesterday citing alleged antisemitism, was one such MP widely expected to meet that fate. But the reality is that, far from facilitating a Corbynite takeover, the trigger-ballot battles taking place across the country have allowed the Labour leader\u2019s critics to come out largely unscathed and better organised than ever. In the summer, ahead of a likely early general election, the party began its trigger-ballot process. It is a system that gives ordinary members a choice: automatically reselect your MP as a candidate, or trigger a full selection process, which could bring in a different challenger. Under new rules, an MP is \u201ctriggered\u201d when the request for a full selection is made by either a third of local party branches or a third of affiliate branches, such as trade unions.

Were they looking less to charge through him than provoke a challenge that would be ruled dangerous and give them a numerical advantage?</p> <p>Three of the quarter-finals mark a contrast in styles: reactive New Zealand against structured Ireland; organised Wales against chaotic France and devilish Japan against bruising South Africa. The exception is England against Australia. The Wallabies resemble their opponents in that they are proficient in the set pieces, strong in the maul and armed with bulldozing ball carriers to storm the gainline.</p> <p>The spontaneity Australia were once renowned for has largely been absent, as they showed in their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/11/australia-cut-loose-at-the-last-to-secure-bonus-point-win-over-georgia\" title=\"\">failure to put away Georgia</a> last week. Eddie Jones would have been put out by the postponement of last Saturday\u2019s match against France having planned meticulously for the tournament.

England look the better equipped side, but a team whose weakness has been reacting when a match starts turning against them have not been extended this tournament.

Two were flourished by Wayne Barnes, who takes charge of the Japan-South Africa match, and the other by Nigel Owens. The framework for high tackles has been in operation since May, but it was not rigidly applied during the summer when only one player was sent off. It meant players and coaches were not encouraged to make radical changes. That has changed and Japan and New Zealand, who prefer to shift the ball than go to ground, should benefit. It was noticeable that when Uruguay played Wales, their ball-carriers targeted the fly-half Rhys Patchell, who has this tournament tended to stand upright in a tackle after receiving a knee to the head when trying to bring down CJ Stander in Dublin last month, resulting in his third concussion in a year. Were they looking less to charge through him than provoke a challenge that would be ruled dangerous and give them a numerical advantage? Three of the quarter-finals mark a contrast in styles: reactive New Zealand against structured Ireland; organised Wales against chaotic France and devilish Japan against bruising South Africa. The exception is England against Australia. The Wallabies resemble their opponents in that they are proficient in the set pieces, strong in the maul and armed with bulldozing ball carriers to storm the gainline. The spontaneity Australia were once renowned for has largely been absent, as they showed in their failure to put away Georgia last week. Eddie Jones would have been put out by the postponement of last Saturday\u2019s match against France having planned meticulously for the tournament. The England management team will have had some even later nights this week to recalibrate and, like the French, the question will be whether two weeks without a match will affect their sharpness. Wales were slow starters after a 10-day break before facing Fiji having begun their opening two matches strongly. Michael Cheika has spent much of the tournament yanking out what remains of his hair in exasperation at the crackdown on dangerous challenges, claiming at one point that everyone was against the Wallabies. Although after Scotland were charged with misconduct by World Rugby for taking exception to the possibility of their final pool match being called off, the head coach was fortunate to escape a summons to appear before a disciplinary committee after letting rip following Reece Hodge\u2019s citing and suspension for a high tackle against Fiji. Australia need to resemble their head coach on Saturday, burning with rage and desire. England look the better equipped side, but a team whose weakness has been reacting when a match starts turning against them have not been extended this tournament. Australia need to show authority at half-back and move the point of attack against opponents who have been able to play the territory game, but their performances so far suggest an early exit. The other Oita quarter-final is an all-Six Nations clash. Wales and France have not served up many memorable encounters in recent years and this does not promise to be an exception. Les Bleus, as has come to be the case at a World Cup, are reported to be at war with each other while their opponents are living in harmony. The two Tokyo matches promise more. Ireland have won two of their last three internationals against New Zealand but the All Blacks, despite talking about not living in the past, have long memories. They will be determined not just to reach the next stage but to reassert their supremacy against a team coached by a wily Kiwi, Joe Schmidt. It promises much. As does the encounter between the hosts and a South Africa side that under Rassie Erasmus have rediscovered their purpose and hardness in a remarkably short time; it is a markedly different team in terms of attitude to the one Japan beat in 2015. The fire against the fury should be an epic. \u2022 This is an extract from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown. To subscribe, just visit this page and follow the instructions.",

We help every individual in the whole club develop and flourish.\u201d</p> <p>Rangnick is a pioneer: at Hoffenheim in 2006, he was one of the first coaches to use video analysis. His methodology is a forerunner of <em>gegenpressing</em>: that the best chance of winning back the ball is within eight seconds of losing it, and most goals are scored within 10 seconds of regaining possession. RB Leipzig scored 60% of their goals like that last season. His teams play with a high tempo and always look to play vertical passes \u2013 just like those Bundesliga teams coached by Rangnick disciples.</p> <p>Rangnick looks back with pride at his work with Leipzig and Red Bull Salzburg, whom he left in 2015. Leipzig were in the fourth division when he joined and are now realistic Bundesliga title contenders. Salzburg are breaking scoring records in Austria (46 goals in 10 games) and had a stunning start to their Champions League campaign, beating Genk 6-2 and losing 4-3 at Liverpool.</p> <p>\u201cWe can see where they are now and say we took the correct decisions at the time; that gives us a good feeling.\u201d Both clubs have spent money but Rangnick makes the point that they are not the only ones. Salzburg have made a profit of more than \u20ac200m in player sales in the past five years.</p> <p>Rangnick fell in love with English football as a 21-year-old student on a year abroad at Sussex University, as part of his English and PE degree from Stuttgart University. He remembers going to the Goldstone Ground and watching Brighton lose 4-1 to Liverpool. \u201cI remember the Brighton fans singing: \u2018Seagulls! Seagulls!\u2019 despite the scoreline. And the Liverpool fans responded: \u2018Seaweed! Seaweed!\u2019 Scouse humour, huh?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b10274f80ace9c8a3e2833cb0058d3f29104020b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b10274f80ace9c8a3e2833cb0058d3f29104020b/0_200_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"J\u00fcrgen Klopp (left) and Ralf Rangnick before the Bundesliga game between Borussia Dortmund and Hoffenheim in October 2010.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">J\u00fcrgen Klopp (left) and Ralf Rangnick before the Bundesliga game between Borussia Dortmund and Hoffenheim in October 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He famously played for the local non-league side Southwick FC, 11 games that moulded him as a coach: \u201cThe most important thing for me was the amount of coaching we did on the pitch,\u201d he says. \u201cWe always spurred each other on, coaching among ourselves or motivating each other. That was inspirational for me.\u201d</p> <p>Now Rangnick is the inspiration, a poster boy for a sporting director model that is increasingly popular in the Premier League \u2013 with one obvious exception. Manchester United let it be known they wanted a director of football more than a year ago but no appointment has followed.</p> <p>So would Rangnick, a sporting director with a proven track record, be interested in an approach from Old Trafford? \u201cI am happy where I am but if any club wanted to speak to me, the question would have to be: \u2018Can I be somebody who can influence areas of development across the whole club?\u2019 Otherwise you are only getting half of what I am capable of. If, after that, you can work together in a trustworthy and respectful way, then you are more likely to be successful.\u201d</p> <p>Rangnick understands the reluctance of some clubs to change a traditional set-up. \u201cIt\u2019s always difficult to follow someone like Sir Alex Ferguson, who was so successful and in place for a long time \u2013 and that\u2019s even harder if you are often changing coaches,\u201d he says. \u201cWith every coaching change, the identity changes and this is reflected in the sporting development. You can look at the money that team has had available in the last five years and say there has been an underperformance.\u201d</p> <p>It is no coincidence, he adds, that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/21/manchester-city-watford-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">the two teams</a> currently dominating the Premier League have a clear playing style. \u201cThey have their identity and know what they need to develop, and so it\u2019s no coincidence that they are dominating the league.\u201d</p>",

Rangnick looks back with pride at his work with Leipzig and Red Bull Salzburg, whom he left in 2015. Leipzig were in the fourth division when he joined and are now realistic Bundesliga title contenders. Salzburg are breaking scoring records in Austria (46 goals in 10 games) and had a stunning start to their Champions League campaign, beating Genk 6-2 and losing 4-3 at Liverpool. \u201cWe can see where they are now and say we took the correct decisions at the time; that gives us a good feeling.\u201d Both clubs have spent money but Rangnick makes the point that they are not the only ones. Salzburg have made a profit of more than \u20ac200m in player sales in the past five years. Rangnick fell in love with English football as a 21-year-old student on a year abroad at Sussex University, as part of his English and PE degree from Stuttgart University. He remembers going to the Goldstone Ground and watching Brighton lose 4-1 to Liverpool. \u201cI remember the Brighton fans singing: \u2018Seagulls! Seagulls!\u2019 despite the scoreline. And the Liverpool fans responded: \u2018Seaweed! Seaweed!\u2019 Scouse humour, huh?\u201d He famously played for the local non-league side Southwick FC, 11 games that moulded him as a coach: \u201cThe most important thing for me was the amount of coaching we did on the pitch,\u201d he says. \u201cWe always spurred each other on, coaching among ourselves or motivating each other. That was inspirational for me.\u201d Now Rangnick is the inspiration, a poster boy for a sporting director model that is increasingly popular in the Premier League \u2013 with one obvious exception. Manchester United let it be known they wanted a director of football more than a year ago but no appointment has followed. So would Rangnick, a sporting director with a proven track record, be interested in an approach from Old Trafford? \u201cI am happy where I am but if any club wanted to speak to me, the question would have to be: \u2018Can I be somebody who can influence areas of development across the whole club?\u2019 Otherwise you are only getting half of what I am capable of. If, after that, you can work together in a trustworthy and respectful way, then you are more likely to be successful.\u201d Rangnick understands the reluctance of some clubs to change a traditional set-up. \u201cIt\u2019s always difficult to follow someone like Sir Alex Ferguson, who was so successful and in place for a long time \u2013 and that\u2019s even harder if you are often changing coaches,\u201d he says. \u201cWith every coaching change, the identity changes and this is reflected in the sporting development. You can look at the money that team has had available in the last five years and say there has been an underperformance.\u201d It is no coincidence, he adds, that the two teams currently dominating the Premier League have a clear playing style. \u201cThey have their identity and know what they need to develop, and so it\u2019s no coincidence that they are dominating the league.\u201d",

I had read enough statistics and policy reports before I started to know that women in prisons were in desperate need of a little female empowerment.

For some, this crime is selling sex from pavements, or soliciting; for plenty of others it is professional shoplifting, known as \u201cgrafting\u201d. This means pocketing anything from fillet steak to mascara to be resold round the houses. In the months leading up to Christmas, shopping lists are collected in pubs for toys and gifts to be stolen on request and sold cut-price. Women are sent out on these grafting missions because they are seen as less conspicuous than men.</p> <p>Needless to say, I was very green in my first few months in prison.

The collage would show a road that meandered from their past experiences to future goals. Almost every road began with bottles of vodka, syringes and shadowy characters, and almost every one ended with symmetrical houses and white wedding dresses and Laura Ashley sofas. I had spiked the magazine pile with my partner\u2019s railway-modelling magazines and glossy Sunday supplements in the hope of inspiring something different \u2013 a new job, an interesting hobby, some travel, perhaps? \u2013 but to little avail. \u201cWhat else would you be doing in the future?\u201d I asked Cathy*, looking at the scenes of domesticity she aspired to. \u201cYou\u2019ve been writing some beautiful poetry about your experiences,\u201d I told her. \u201cI could help you get them published as part of a campaign for prison reform.\u201d</p> <p>Cathy was about my age (29) but since leaving the care system had only known the control of either a man or the state. She, like many others, was a shoplifter and was frequently in and out of prison for theft and drug possession. \u201cIt will be finding \u2018the one\u2019 that will get me out of my mess,\u201d she said. \u201cHe will look after me and keep people away who come round trying to sell me gear [heroin] again.\u201d</p> <p>Cathy\u2019s was an oft-told story. She had been prevented from seeing her children by social services because she couldn\u2019t stop seeing an abusive partner. He kept coming round and, against her best judgment, she opened the door.</p> <p>What I wanted to say was that she didn\u2019t need a man to straighten her life out for her, that she had \u201ceverything she needed inside of her\u201d (life advice that works best when Instagrammed over a picture of a thin white girl walking into a sunset).</p> <p>In time I came to realise that she was probably right. Ambition and independence are a good deal further up the hierarchy of need than security. It\u2019s pretty realistic to assume that the quickest way to ward off a coercive and abusive man is to find another man who is kinder and stronger to stand in the way.</p> <p>Prison changed my attitude to sex work, too. The jail had just appointed its first female governor and she was keen to put feminism on the agenda for International Women\u2019s Day that year. My projects (I had previously hosted a lecture by a non-binary Mars astronaut, run a workshop on gender-neutral pronouns and started a choir that sang protest songs) that would have been met with eye-rolls before her arrival were now enthusiastically scheduled: a showing of the film Made in Dagenham followed by a debate on the gender pay gap. The learning and skills department was running a concurrent visit from a local museum, featuring artefacts from the suffragette movement.</p> <p>I had engaged with ideological debates on the topic of sex work before, of course I had. I knew that to question whether sex work is really like any other work would make you a dreaded \u201cswerf\u201d (sex worker exclusionary radical feminist) and \u2013 like the patriarchy \u2013 is an attempt to control what women do with their bodies. People don\u2019t need rescuing, the theory goes, they need rights and unions.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I had assumed that sex work was well paid. Most women could only keep 10%</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Phoebe was the first to speak after I had introduced the topic of equal pay and sexism in the workplace. She was, as many of the women in prison were, \u201con the game\u201d. She worked as an escort, managing her business online, so she could charge her own prices and didn\u2019t need to rely on a pimp. She was fairly new to the jail, and had been transferred from a big city prison, ruffling the other inmates with her manicured nails and diamante sliders. \u201cI don\u2019t think women get it worse at all,\u201d she said. \u201cWe get doors opened, bought presents, we got everything we need to get what we want right here.\u201d She ran her hand down the length of her body and winked. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that if you\u2019re a man.\u201d</p> <p>She directed her comments pointedly to the woman next to her. Lesley was the kind of sex worker we more often see in prison, known as a \u201csurvival sex worker\u201d, someone on the game because they have no other choice. Lesley sold \u00a36 blowjobs from street corners to fund her and her partner\u2019s heroin addictions, the signs of which showed on her face, with hollowed cheeks and yellowed teeth. Before I worked in prisons, I had assumed that sex work must be quite well paid per hour \u2013 that even those with a pimp could surely enjoy a 60:40 split of the takings. This was wishful thinking. Although there are plenty of women like Phoebe, they are less likely to end up in jail, meeting people like me. Most of the women I met were getting more like 10%, or being paid in drugs and housing rather than cash. The almost universally male pimps often have a group of women in their employ and rake in the takings in return for protection. In other words, it\u2019s a racket. Survival sex work has a worse gender pay gap than almost any other industry. \u201cDoes anyone disagree with Phoebe?\u201d I asked. There was a silence, then Lesley piped up. \u201cI don\u2019t see anyone\u2019s boyfriends having to go out on the game,\u201d she said. Phoebe rolled her eyes. \u201cNo one\u2019s making you, babe. And no one is setting your prices that low either.\u201d I started to sense that there was some sort of argument from the wing going on here that I was not aware of, and the spat was working its way into our discussion in the guise of a price war. \u201cYou\u2019re bringing everyone\u2019s prices down with what you charge on the pavement, you slut.\u201d By this point, they had both got up. \u201cWe do the same thing,\u201d Lesley shouted. \u201cDon\u2019t you go thinking you\u2019re better than me.\u201d By this point, I had lost the room. Security had arrived. And the questions I had planned about unionisation and female solidarity were drowned out by more immediate concerns.</p> <p>It was not the International Women\u2019s Day I had planned. But as happened so often in my time in prison, the theories and beliefs I came in with sat uncomfortably next to the nuance of the reality. The majority of sex workers I met in prison, who arrived with bruises and track-marks, would rather have been doing anything else. They needed their rights protected, sure, but they also wanted a route out. The reality was not simple. It rarely is.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/may/22/pregnancy-is-a-time-bomb-what-i-learned-about-motherhood-working-in-a-womens-prison\">\u2018Pregnancy is a time bomb\u2019 \u2013 what I learned about motherhood working in a women\u2019s prison</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I learned that my idealism had made me treat feminism like a club rather than a journey.

Brexit supporters say this can be managed by doing checks on goods away from the border, but critics say it will be difficult to police this without any physical infrastructure like border posts or cameras, which could raise tensions in the divided communities of Ireland.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p><b>Interactive: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2019/sep/02/a-typical-hour-in-the-life-of-the-irish-border\">A typical hour in the life of the Irish border</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The pound fell 0.5% against the dollar and the euro within minutes of the announcement.</p> \n<p>The DUP statement said: \u201cAs things stand, we could not support what is being suggested on customs and consent issues, and there is a lack of clarity on VAT.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/duponline/status/1184707245478678533\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"und\" dir=\"ltr\">\u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f <a href=\"https://t.co/zpReVsavVu\">pic.twitter.com/zpReVsavVu</a></p>\u2014 DUP (@duponline) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/duponline/status/1184707245478678533?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 17, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>The statement will come as blow to the prime minister, who hopes to bring back a deal from the Brussels meeting and then secure the backing of parliament in a rare Commons vote pencilled in for Saturday.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/16/michel-barnier-optimistic-of-deal-after-pm-makes-concessions-on-irish-border\">The backing of the 10 DUP MPs is crucial for the success of that vote</a> because many Conservative Brexiters have indicated they will not back a deal that is opposed by unionists.</p> \n<p>Steve Baker, the chair of the hard Brexit European Research Group, said he was optimistic the group would back a deal.

      "bodyText": "The Democratic Unionist party is threatening to scupper the Brexit deal that Boris Johnson is on the brink of agreeing with the EU. On the morning of a crucial EU summit in Brussels, a joint statement from the DUP\u2019s leader, Arlene Foster, and her deputy, Nigel Dodds, explicitly says the party cannot support the deal that is close to being finalised. The pound fell 0.5% against the dollar and the euro within minutes of the announcement. The DUP statement said: \u201cAs things stand, we could not support what is being suggested on customs and consent issues, and there is a lack of clarity on VAT.\u201d The statement will come as blow to the prime minister, who hopes to bring back a deal from the Brussels meeting and then secure the backing of parliament in a rare Commons vote pencilled in for Saturday. The backing of the 10 DUP MPs is crucial for the success of that vote because many Conservative Brexiters have indicated they will not back a deal that is opposed by unionists. Steve Baker, the chair of the hard Brexit European Research Group, said he was optimistic the group would back a deal. But he also suggested the ERG could not support it if Johnson failed to secure the backing of the DUP. The DUP statement added: \u201cWe will continue to work with the government to try and get a sensible deal that works for Northern Ireland and protects the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom.\u201d Johnson has met Foster and Dodds three times in the last three days as he tried to shore up their support before Saturday\u2019s deadline to prevent a delay to Brexit. Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, told Johnson in a phone call on Thursday morning that time was short if leaders were to approve the Brexit deal this week. A spokesman for the commission said: \u201cEvery hour and minute counts before the [European council],. We want a deal.\u201d EU leaders are meeting in Brussels in the afternoon for a two- day summit and Brexit was due to be the first item on the agenda. A senior EU official said a legal text was yet to be shared among member states as Downing Street had not given the green light. \u201cMaybe we have a deal, maybe not\u201d, the official said. \u201cWe have somehow got used to it \u2013 we know when Brexit is on the agenda we expect the unexpected.\u201d Discussions on the tentative Brexit deal could now be pushed back to Friday to give Johnson more time to win over the DUP. The official said: \u201cStill today we don\u2019t know how things will evolve. But I think at a certain moment, if there is no legal text there will be someone who will say: \u2018A withdrawal agreement is an international treaty and my officials need to read it before I approve it \u2013 this is an ancient tradition and I am not willing to change it\u2019.\u201d Johnson would be given an opportunity to address the EU27 on the terms of the deal, if it was secured, the source said. \u201cWe will have to consider our options in light of the situation\u201d, the official said in an acknowledgement that the issue of a Brexit extension beyond 31 October was likely to be discussed. The official said even if a deal was given political approval at the summit, it \u201cmay be impossible\u201d to have it ratified before 31 October, given the complexity of the treaty, the need for \u201clegal scrubbing\u201d and parliamentary scrutiny on both sides of the channel. The housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, said on BBC Breakfast: \u201cWe know there are clearly concerns on the part of the DUP and we want to try and work through these productively in the hours to come. \u201cAll sides in this do want to secure an orderly exit from the EU, and I think one is in sight, although there is clearly very significant issues to be hammered out. Let\u2019s wait and see.\u201d He said he expected Johnson to go to Brussels to meet with members of the European council. Under the so-called Benn act, if Johnson cannot get a deal passed by Saturday he will be forced to seek an extension to the 31 October deadline for the UK to leave the European Union. The DUP is digging in over the prospect of a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, as well as the issues of consent regarding the suspended Stormont assembly. Another significant issue is whether EU VAT rates would apply in Northern Ireland. Johnson told the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers a day before the summit that his situation was like climbing Mount Everest, according to MPs in attendance. The Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, has confirmed that the PM will write a letter asking for an article 50 extension if no deal is in place by Saturday. This is despite Johnson repeatedly ruling out asking for a further delay under his \u201cdo or die\u201d commitment to leave the EU by the current Halloween deadline.",

      "body": "<p>Sports confronted by nightmare revelations of sexual abuse have dramatically improved their safeguarding cultures, but a whiff of the bad old days has sullied the latest response to historic abuse in tennis.</p> <p>Martin Corrie, president of the Lawn Tennis Association, resigned last month following an investigation into his failures to properly handle a complaint made 15 years ago by a woman who as a young player suffered abuse by her male coach in the 1990s. The LTA announced in a statement that disciplinary proceedings against Corrie had been discontinued, as he had stepped down, acknowledged he had been at fault and issued an apology. But at the same time the LTA voted in favour of Corrie for prestigious re\u2011election to the board of the International Tennis Federation.</p> <p>The victim, who has spoken to the Guardian while not wanting her name to be made public, was actually satisfied with the outcome of the process and the resignation of Corrie \u2013 although he has still not apologised to her in person \u2013 and two other unnamed senior administrators. But she feels strongly that it and the improvements at the LTA, under the head of safeguarding, Dave Humphrey, have been undermined by the simultaneous elevation of Corrie to the ITF, and an overall lack of transparency about this disciplinary process.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/25/lta-failed-act-warnings-sex-abuse-coach-daniel-sanders\">LTA failed to act on warnings about coach later convicted of sexual abuse</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI welcome the news that those involved with my 2004 complaint who were still under LTA jurisdiction have resigned, and failings were admitted on behalf of Hertfordshire LTA and the LTA nationally,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m encouraged by and support the steps Dave Humphrey is taking to overhaul safeguarding procedures and training within the LTA. I am assured that procedures are being put in place to ensure that what happened in my case could not happen again.</p> <p>\u201cHowever I am disappointed that at the end of the process, and with limited information released by the LTA, I still have unanswered questions about who knew and did what at different times. I also feel that this has been a missed opportunity for the LTA to give a very clear message to the wider world and other victims of abuse about its improved commitment to safeguarding. The LTA\u2019s decision to approve the nomination of Martin Corrie for the ITF board, on the same day his resignation was announced, also seems to confuse that issue and somewhat undermines the very positive outcome of the process.\u201d</p> <p>She came forward to complain about how Corrie and others had handled her case in 2004, after she read 13 years later <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/nov/23/lta-child-protection-failings-coach-abuse\" title=\"\">about a coach\u2019s sustained sexual abuse</a> of a young female player at the elite tennis centre in Wrexham, and the LTA safeguarding failures that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/25/lta-failed-act-warnings-sex-abuse-coach-daniel-sanders\" title=\"\">had enabled it to continue</a>.</p> <p>She recalled that when she first made known the abuse she had suffered at Hertfordshire LTA, she was given no support, and felt that the tennis hierarchies closed ranks against her before the coach was sanctioned in 2005 and had his licence to work with children revoked.</p> <p>With Humphrey, a former Metropolitan police detective chief inspector, in place the LTA set up an independent investigation and in March last year Corrie stepped down from the presidency pending its outcome.</p> <p>No more was said publicly about the investigation until 26 September, <a href=\"https://www.lta.org.uk/about-us/tennis-news/news-and-opinion/general-news/2019/september/safeguarding-case--summary-of-process--findings/\" title=\"\">when the LTA issued a short summary</a>. It stated that the investigation had in fact led to charges of misconduct against Corrie, and the two other administrators, for failing to \u201cact appropriately in relation to the handling of the [original] allegations, including not doing enough to support the victim\u201d. The three \u201crobustly denied any misconduct\u201d, the summary said. In March this year they had agreed to a formal hearing of the charges by an independent disciplinary panel, to be constituted by the respected Sports Resolutions organisation.</p> <p>Before the panel sat, however, Corrie and the other two administrators resigned, undertook additional safeguarding training, and told the panel they recognised \u201cmatters should have been handled differently\u201d. Then Corrie, via his legal representatives, proposed to the panel that the disciplinary proceedings be discontinued, to which the panel agreed because it considered the outcome \u201cproportionate and appropriate.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9168d89f41fa4497238d5e74c179f74c2add4a89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9168d89f41fa4497238d5e74c179f74c2add4a89/0_138_1387_832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Martin Corrie\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Martin Corrie admitted that the handling of the 2004 abuse complaint \u2018was not good enough\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The LTA chief executive, Scott Lloyd, apologised in a statement for the failings established by the investigation, and stressed that the organisation\u2019s safeguarding improvements have been recognised as excellent by the NSPCC\u2019s <a href=\"https://thecpsu.org.uk\" title=\"\">Child Protection in Sport Unit</a>. Corrie himself acknowledged in the statement that when handling the 2004 complaint \u201ccommunication between Hertfordshire LTA and the LTA was not good enough\u201d. He said: \u201cMatters should have been handled differently both in respect of the way in which the allegations were handled and in the support offered to the victim by the Hertfordshire LTA and I sincerely apologise for my part in this.\u201d</p> <p>He announced he was stepping down as president and from the LTA board because: \u201cI do not wish anything to distract from the important role the LTA has in promoting and embedding best practice in the management and safeguarding of tennis.\u201d</p> <p>Neither the LTA nor Corrie made it clear in the statement that he was at the same time being supported by the LTA for re-election to the ITF board.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Recap\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption><strong>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</strong></figcaption> </figure>  <p>The LTA explained that by saying: \u201cMartin was nominated as a candidate earlier this year, because we did not wish to prejudge the independent disciplinary process. Once this came to a conclusion, and with the independent panel advising there was nothing to preclude future roles in tennis, the LTA board considered that it should vote for his re-election to the board position he had held for four years.\u201d</p> <p>The victim in the case is, despite this spectacle, determined to emphasise the positive outcome from her coming forward in 2017: \u201cAt the time I came forward with my original complaint I was met with resistance, the matter was not handled properly by Hertfordshire LTA or the LTA, and I was not given support which caused enormous damage to me, professionally and personally.</p> <p>\u201cThis case is significant because it concerns those in positions of authority who had a duty of care. I still hope that it will serve as a landmark for similar cases involving people with such responsibilities, who must be held accountable for ensuring the safety of children and vulnerable adults in sport.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sports confronted by nightmare revelations of sexual abuse have dramatically improved their safeguarding cultures, but a whiff of the bad old days has sullied the latest response to historic abuse in tennis. Martin Corrie, president of the Lawn Tennis Association, resigned last month following an investigation into his failures to properly handle a complaint made 15 years ago by a woman who as a young player suffered abuse by her male coach in the 1990s. The LTA announced in a statement that disciplinary proceedings against Corrie had been discontinued, as he had stepped down, acknowledged he had been at fault and issued an apology. But at the same time the LTA voted in favour of Corrie for prestigious re\u2011election to the board of the International Tennis Federation. The victim, who has spoken to the Guardian while not wanting her name to be made public, was actually satisfied with the outcome of the process and the resignation of Corrie \u2013 although he has still not apologised to her in person \u2013 and two other unnamed senior administrators. But she feels strongly that it and the improvements at the LTA, under the head of safeguarding, Dave Humphrey, have been undermined by the simultaneous elevation of Corrie to the ITF, and an overall lack of transparency about this disciplinary process. \u201cI welcome the news that those involved with my 2004 complaint who were still under LTA jurisdiction have resigned, and failings were admitted on behalf of Hertfordshire LTA and the LTA nationally,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m encouraged by and support the steps Dave Humphrey is taking to overhaul safeguarding procedures and training within the LTA. I am assured that procedures are being put in place to ensure that what happened in my case could not happen again. \u201cHowever I am disappointed that at the end of the process, and with limited information released by the LTA, I still have unanswered questions about who knew and did what at different times. I also feel that this has been a missed opportunity for the LTA to give a very clear message to the wider world and other victims of abuse about its improved commitment to safeguarding. The LTA\u2019s decision to approve the nomination of Martin Corrie for the ITF board, on the same day his resignation was announced, also seems to confuse that issue and somewhat undermines the very positive outcome of the process.\u201d She came forward to complain about how Corrie and others had handled her case in 2004, after she read 13 years later about a coach\u2019s sustained sexual abuse of a young female player at the elite tennis centre in Wrexham, and the LTA safeguarding failures that had enabled it to continue. She recalled that when she first made known the abuse she had suffered at Hertfordshire LTA, she was given no support, and felt that the tennis hierarchies closed ranks against her before the coach was sanctioned in 2005 and had his licence to work with children revoked. With Humphrey, a former Metropolitan police detective chief inspector, in place the LTA set up an independent investigation and in March last year Corrie stepped down from the presidency pending its outcome. No more was said publicly about the investigation until 26 September, when the LTA issued a short summary. It stated that the investigation had in fact led to charges of misconduct against Corrie, and the two other administrators, for failing to \u201cact appropriately in relation to the handling of the [original] allegations, including not doing enough to support the victim\u201d. The three \u201crobustly denied any misconduct\u201d, the summary said. In March this year they had agreed to a formal hearing of the charges by an independent disciplinary panel, to be constituted by the respected Sports Resolutions organisation. Before the panel sat, however, Corrie and the other two administrators resigned, undertook additional safeguarding training, and told the panel they recognised \u201cmatters should have been handled differently\u201d. Then Corrie, via his legal representatives, proposed to the panel that the disciplinary proceedings be discontinued, to which the panel agreed because it considered the outcome \u201cproportionate and appropriate.\u201d The LTA chief executive, Scott Lloyd, apologised in a statement for the failings established by the investigation, and stressed that the organisation\u2019s safeguarding improvements have been recognised as excellent by the NSPCC\u2019s Child Protection in Sport Unit. Corrie himself acknowledged in the statement that when handling the 2004 complaint \u201ccommunication between Hertfordshire LTA and the LTA was not good enough\u201d. He said: \u201cMatters should have been handled differently both in respect of the way in which the allegations were handled and in the support offered to the victim by the Hertfordshire LTA and I sincerely apologise for my part in this.\u201d He announced he was stepping down as president and from the LTA board because: \u201cI do not wish anything to distract from the important role the LTA has in promoting and embedding best practice in the management and safeguarding of tennis.\u201d Neither the LTA nor Corrie made it clear in the statement that he was at the same time being supported by the LTA for re-election to the ITF board. The LTA explained that by saying: \u201cMartin was nominated as a candidate earlier this year, because we did not wish to prejudge the independent disciplinary process. Once this came to a conclusion, and with the independent panel advising there was nothing to preclude future roles in tennis, the LTA board considered that it should vote for his re-election to the board position he had held for four years.\u201d The victim in the case is, despite this spectacle, determined to emphasise the positive outcome from her coming forward in 2017: \u201cAt the time I came forward with my original complaint I was met with resistance, the matter was not handled properly by Hertfordshire LTA or the LTA, and I was not given support which caused enormous damage to me, professionally and personally. \u201cThis case is significant because it concerns those in positions of authority who had a duty of care. I still hope that it will serve as a landmark for similar cases involving people with such responsibilities, who must be held accountable for ensuring the safety of children and vulnerable adults in sport.\u201d",

Want to go back further? Tom Brady was a sixth-round pick, and now has six Super Bowl rings.</p> <p>Repeat after me, Miami: You do not need to be first in line to land a franchise QB. In fact, the stats line up against it. In total, 14 No1 picks <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_first_overall_National_Football_League_draft_picks\">have been spent on quarterbacks this century</a>. Only one has Super Bowl wins to his name \u2013 the esteemed Elisha Nelson Manning IV.

From 2012 to 2016, he was the most hit and most pressured QB in the NFL, as GM Ryan Grigson <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SharpFootball/status/1165440517682999296?\">drafted only three offensive linemen before the 7<sup>th</sup> round</a> from 2012-2015. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/24/andrew-luck-retires-indianapolis-colts-quarterback\">Now Luck is retired</a>, physically broken by the game at just 29 years old.</p> <p>Tanking for the No1 is a crutch for underperforming organizations like Miami; a team with issues far beyond the ability to drop lucky on a quarterback. This speaks to a deeper dysfunction with hiring the right people to hire the right people. It speaks to an inability to see something in players other teams don\u2019t and develop that talent to its fullest. Would Pat Mahomes, for all his unspeakable ability, be having the same impact on the Miami Dolphins as he is with the Kansas City Chiefs? No.</p> <p>The league\u2019s reigning MVP was afforded a year to learn behind Smith, under the guidance of the Chiefs\u2019 offensive-minded head coach, Andy Reid. In 2018, he had an offensive line ranked seventh in the NFL in pass blocking efficiency: he was only sacked eight times all season. He had Pro Bowlers Tyreek Hill and Travis Kelce to throw to. He had dual-threat running back Kareem Hunt hauling in seven TD catches and running in seven more, prior to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/nov/30/kansas-city-chiefs-release-running-back-after-alleged-assault-video-surfaces\">his release</a>. How much of that is already in place in Miami? Precisely none of it.</p> <p>It\u2019s not about the highest pick, it\u2019s about having a plan and building for that<em> </em>moment, not starting from scratch when you draft the QB with a destitute, demoralised playing staff and fanbase. It\u2019s environment, it\u2019s culture, it\u2019s coaching, it\u2019s synergy with the front office. Even if the pick is a can\u2019t miss prospect, it\u2019s about putting the best people and pieces around him to ensure he has a hope in hell in the NFL.</p> <p>Regardless, any QB drafted by the Dolphins is going straight into the firing line with a team still undertaking a multiyear \u201croster construction\u201d project. The team has amassed 12 draft picks for 2020 and three first-rounders, sacrificing some elite talent in the process. However, even if those all picks land (Miami\u2019s recent front office record suggests they won\u2019t), those players will also be rookies making a transition to the pros. With free-agent signings also likely, Miami will be fielding a brand new team in 2020.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/01/miami-dolphins-beer-724-dollars-vendor-arrested-nfl\">Vendor arrested after charging $724 for two beers at Miami Dolphins game</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For those established Dolphins players \u2013 unfortunate enough to remain on the team this season \u2013 this is another lost year. It\u2019s clear the players are not in on this tank; they\u2019re trying to win with a roster gutted of its playmakers. Morale is crushed, they\u2019re tired of being embarrassed in half-empty stadiums and outnumbered by visiting fans every other week. Faith in the organisation may be irrecoverable.

Miami\u2019s first-round pick in 2018 immediately facilitated a trade after a 59-10 Week 1 loss at home to Baltimore. It\u2019s no stretch to believe Fitzpatrick would have have been on the phone to Tua, explaining what caused him to flee to Pittsburgh. It\u2019s unlikely, but there\u2019s an outside chance Tua could look to do the same as Manning and Elway. And then what?</p> <p>The No1 pick is not the golden ticket the Dolphins franchise is moving towards. The smart money isn\u2019t on that approach yielding the glory that owner Stephen Ross \u2013 whose team has the distinction of hosting this year\u2019s Super Bowl, while also being farthest away from it \u2013 seeks so badly.</p>",

It speaks to an inability to see something in players other teams don\u2019t and develop that talent to its fullest. Would Pat Mahomes, for all his unspeakable ability, be having the same impact on the Miami Dolphins as he is with the Kansas City Chiefs? No. The league\u2019s reigning MVP was afforded a year to learn behind Smith, under the guidance of the Chiefs\u2019 offensive-minded head coach, Andy Reid. In 2018, he had an offensive line ranked seventh in the NFL in pass blocking efficiency: he was only sacked eight times all season. He had Pro Bowlers Tyreek Hill and Travis Kelce to throw to. He had dual-threat running back Kareem Hunt hauling in seven TD catches and running in seven more, prior to his release. How much of that is already in place in Miami? Precisely none of it. It\u2019s not about the highest pick, it\u2019s about having a plan and building for that moment, not starting from scratch when you draft the QB with a destitute, demoralised playing staff and fanbase. It\u2019s environment, it\u2019s culture, it\u2019s coaching, it\u2019s synergy with the front office. Even if the pick is a can\u2019t miss prospect, it\u2019s about putting the best people and pieces around him to ensure he has a hope in hell in the NFL. Regardless, any QB drafted by the Dolphins is going straight into the firing line with a team still undertaking a multiyear \u201croster construction\u201d project. The team has amassed 12 draft picks for 2020 and three first-rounders, sacrificing some elite talent in the process. However, even if those all picks land (Miami\u2019s recent front office record suggests they won\u2019t), those players will also be rookies making a transition to the pros. With free-agent signings also likely, Miami will be fielding a brand new team in 2020. For those established Dolphins players \u2013 unfortunate enough to remain on the team this season \u2013 this is another lost year. It\u2019s clear the players are not in on this tank; they\u2019re trying to win with a roster gutted of its playmakers. Morale is crushed, they\u2019re tired of being embarrassed in half-empty stadiums and outnumbered by visiting fans every other week. Faith in the organisation may be irrecoverable. And, when the blighted 2019 stat sheets are thrown down on the negotiating table, their next contract with another team mightn\u2019t look so good either. And there\u2019s also no absolute guarantee this tanking project will yield what appears to be the desired result. Eli Manning and John Elway refused their draft assignments and held out for trades elsewhere. Tagovailoa\u2019s former Crimson Tide teammate Minkah Fitzpatrick, is one of the lucky ones. Miami\u2019s first-round pick in 2018 immediately facilitated a trade after a 59-10 Week 1 loss at home to Baltimore. It\u2019s no stretch to believe Fitzpatrick would have have been on the phone to Tua, explaining what caused him to flee to Pittsburgh. It\u2019s unlikely, but there\u2019s an outside chance Tua could look to do the same as Manning and Elway. And then what? The No1 pick is not the golden ticket the Dolphins franchise is moving towards. The smart money isn\u2019t on that approach yielding the glory that owner Stephen Ross \u2013 whose team has the distinction of hosting this year\u2019s Super Bowl, while also being farthest away from it \u2013 seeks so badly.",

      "bodyText": "Anglican churches around Australia have pushed back against Sydney Archbishop Glenn Davies\u2019 suggestion to same-sex marriage supporters that they \u201cplease leave\u201d the church. In an address to the 51st Synod of the Diocese of Sydney, Davies said those who supported same-sex marriage should abandon the church. \u201cI fear for the stability of the Anglican Church of Australia. These developments have the potential to fracture our fellowship and impair our communion. I have stated this on numerous occasions at the annual National Bishops\u2019 Conference, but sadly to little effect,\u201d he said. \u201cMy own view is that if people wish to change the doctrine of our church, they should start a new church or join a church 0more aligned to their views \u2013 but do not ruin the Anglican Church by abandoning the plain teaching of Scripture. Please leave us. \u201cWe have far too much work to do in evangelising Australia to be distracted by the constant pressure to change our doctrine in order to satisfy the lusts and pleasures of the world.\u201d The Sydney Anglican diocese is notoriously conservative. As well as their official opposition to same-sex marriage, they do not allow women to be ordained as priests or bishops. Other, more progressive, sections of the church have rejected Davies\u2019 position. In a letter to ministers on Thursday, the Southern Queensland archbishop\u2019s commissary Reverend Jeremy Greaves said there had been \u201cdeep distress\u201d about Davies\u2019 comments and his views did not reflect that of the Anglican Church in Southern Queensland. \u201cThe Anglican Church in Southern Queensland has taken a different view, expressing its desire to be a welcoming and safe church for all and together to work through admittedly complex issues on which people hold diverse views,\u201d he said. \u201cAll God\u2019s children are welcome and affirmed in the Anglican Church Southern Queensland and no one is asked to leave,\u201d he said. \u201cWe treasure the unity of the church and the reconciliation of all people and the whole creation wrought by the life, death, and resurrection of Christ. \u201cAsking people to leave the church undermines this fundamental truth.\u201d He also noted the Brisbane Diocesan Synod had recently affirmed that trans and gender diverse people can attend Anglican schools. Archbishop of Perth, Kay Goldsworthy said all members of the LGBTIQ community were welcome in the Anglican Church in Perth and said it is \u201ctroubling that the welcome is not universal.\u201d \u201cThe Perth Diocese of the Anglican Church has long been a strong supporter of the LGBTIQ community and it is an appropriate time to reiterate and emphasise the message of a 2017 resolution of the Perth Diocese,\u201d she said. \u201cIt affirmed that \u2018all people are made in the image of God regardless of their race, sex, economic background and political affiliation \u2026\u2019 and offered a heartfelt apology to, and sought forgiveness from, the LGBTIQ Community \u2018whom we have hurt by words and behaviour that have not displayed the love of God\u2019.\u201d She said the diocese of Perth is committed to fostering churches where compassion and grace abound. \u201cWe desire to be places where all people will feel safe. We want to be welcoming of all people.\u201d In a statement, the Melbourne archbishop Philip Freier also said the church would not turn people away. \u201cThe Anglican diocese of Melbourne welcomes all Christians and anyone else to attend Anglican services in Melbourne. Anglicans hold a wide variety of views on social issues, and that is a matter for their consciences,\u201d he said. The position of the Sydney Anglican diocese is not surprising, considering it donated $1m to the \u201cno\u201d campaign during the 2017 postal survey, but it is being seen as a push back against more progressive elements of the church. In September, the Synod of the Diocese of Wangaratta in Victoria agreed to allow blessings of same-sex marriages. There was expected to be a blessing of the civil marriage of two gay priests from the area, but it was delayed after the decision was challenged to the church\u2019s appellate tribunal. The tribunal will consider whether the blessings go against the Anglican Church\u2019s constitution. The church has been grappling with the issue of same-sex marriage during the nearly two years since it became legal in Australia. Next year the Anglican Church\u2019s general synod will hold a conference alongside its special session where delegates can discuss issues facing the church, including same-sex relationships and marriage, and discuss ways forward. In a book of essays published by the church\u2019s general synod in July, some of the church\u2019s leading figures in Australia have debated whether the church can bless same-sex unions, arguing the positions both for and against.",

I want a laptop where I can easily replace components such as memory and hard drives. How does one go about finding out which modern laptops are modifiable by users? <strong>Colin</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>The one-sentence answer is that consumer laptops often can\u2019t be modified by users, while business laptops can. There are lots of exceptions, but it\u2019s a reasonable rule-of-thumb.</p> <p>It\u2019s not a complete answer, because you also have to know which laptops are aimed at consumers, and which at business users. This is also a somewhat fuzzy area because businesses can use laptops that are really designed for consumers \u2013 Dell\u2019s XPS 13 and Apple\u2019s MacBook are examples \u2013 while consumers can and do buy business machines.</p> <p>The corollary is something I hear a lot, though it\u2019s more of a complaint than a question: why do the major PC suppliers sell so many different ranges of laptops? They may offer half a dozen or more laptops with similar or even identical specifications under different brand names at different prices, so it\u2019s easy to be confused.</p> <h2><strong>Business or pleasure?</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"afdf913d6542e6c0b88f863b451cf9ed5c570818\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/afdf913d6542e6c0b88f863b451cf9ed5c570818/0_1_908_545/500.jpg\" alt=\"Lenovo\u2019s ThinkPad L series laptops are business machines.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lenovo\u2019s ThinkPad L series laptops are business machines.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lenovo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Consumers and business buyers have different uses in mind, which means they have different buying criteria. The big PC manufacturers \u2013 mainly Dell, HP and Lenovo \u2013 therefore create different ranges to meet these different needs.</p> <p>Most consumers want laptops that are uncomplicated and as cheap as possible. Their desires are met by manufacturing laptops with \u201cstandard\u201d specifications in very large volumes, sometimes millions of units per year. Most consumers don\u2019t modify their laptops anyway, so it makes sense to solder and glue everything down. This increases reliability, and avoids some of the support calls that destroy the razor-thin profits made on these machines.</p> <p>It also makes them hard to repair, of course, but laptops have become almost as disposable as smartphones and tablets. Some are so cheap it\u2019s simpler to responsibly recycle a broken laptop and buy a new one. Businesses want laptops that are sturdy, reliable and repairable, and they are willing to pay a bit more for them. As a result, business laptops are tested to provide much higher levels of use in much more variable conditions. Some are tested to meet US <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIL-STD-810\">military specification standards</a> because they will be used by the police and armed forces, and so on. (There are even more rugged machines designed for field service technicians, oil rigs and battlefield use.)</p> <p>Businesses typically need a wider range of configurations, and many of their users need more than the \u201cstandard\u201d specification of the day. Often, they also want to be able to buy and support the same laptops for a very long time. Consumer laptops can change every few months, and the specs can vary if someone gets a bargain deal on a particular component. By contrast, businesses buying fleets of perhaps 10,000 or more machines want to be able to buy identical machines over a long period, perhaps 12-18 months, and parts for up to five years. Sometimes their IT departments repair machines by swapping in parts from broken ones, so it helps if the components are effectively the same. Standardisation reduces the cost of ownership.</p> <p>Business laptops sometimes have extra features such as connections for docking stations, they come with Windows 10 Pro instead of Home, and they get better support. Global businesses also want laptops that can be repaired or replaced anywhere in the world.</p> <p>You can, of course, buy a business laptop even if you don\u2019t have a business. In fact, if your pattern of use is similar, it\u2019s the best option. If it\u2019s just for casual use, it\u2019s overkill.</p> <h2><strong>Brand differentiation</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"760ce976e99090c693657fbcfd56701430dd17bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/760ce976e99090c693657fbcfd56701430dd17bd/0_129_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Razer Blade Stealth is one of a few thin and light gaming laptops.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Razer Blade Stealth is one of a few thin and light gaming laptops.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hannibal Hanschke/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Companies that sell a lot of PCs \u2013 both HP and Lenovo shift about 40m a year \u2013 can afford to support product ranges that target different sets of buyers. It\u2019s really no different from, say, car manufacturers, where the product line can stretch from a Ford Ka+ to a Transit Minibus, with sportier options such as the Mustang and the <a href=\"https://www.ford.co.uk/cars/gt\">Ford GT</a>. PC\u2019s can stretch from mini versions to giant server farms (blade computers), with sportier options such as games PCs.</p> <p>Even the laptop market runs from <a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/gpd-micropc-6-inch-handheld-industry-laptop#/\">novel-sized versions with 6in screens</a> to game-playing <a href=\"https://uk-store.acer.com/predator-21-x-curved-gaming-notebook\">monsters with 17.3in or even larger screens</a>. It must be admitted that mid-range laptops tend to look much the same, but there are differences, even if consumers are not aware of them.</p> <p>Dell, for example, has a wide range of brands. The Inspiron range provides cheap machines for home users, while XPS started as its luxury consumer range. For business buyers, Latitude is Dell\u2019s laptop range and OptiPlex its upmarket desktop range. Other Dell brands include Alienware for gamers, Vostro for small office/home office (SoHo) users, Prestige for business workstations, and PowerEdge for rack-mounted servers. <a href=\"https://www.dell.com/learn/mk/en/mkcorp1/press-releases/2016-11-15-dell-emc-expands-high-performance-computing\">Dell EMC does supercomputers</a>.</p> <p>So, if you want a laptop that can be repaired and upgraded, you\u2019re more likely to find it in the business ranges. Examples include Dell\u2019s Latitude and Prestige ranges, HP ZBooks, ProBooks and EliteBooks, and Lenovo ThinkPads, which <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad\">originated with IBM in 1992</a>. However, even business laptops are going with the trend towards thinner and lighter machines that are less flexible and harder to upgrade or repair.</p> <p>If you don\u2019t need much portability, gaming laptops can usually be expanded and upgraded. However, \u201cthin and light\u201d models are somewhat rare, the 13in <a href=\"https://www.razer.com/gb-en/gaming-laptops/razer-blade-stealth\">Razer Blade Stealth</a> (fixed memory) and the 15.6in <a href=\"https://www.gigabyte.com/uk/Laptop#AERO-series\">Gigabyte Aero 15</a> being the most obvious examples.</p> <h2><strong>Practical approaches</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"72860230b765728b562711b000f880ab16b50bb4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/72860230b765728b562711b000f880ab16b50bb4/0_0_1203_722/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Some ThinkPads are upgradeable, but check the specific models before you buy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Some ThinkPads are upgradeable, but check the specific models before you buy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lenovo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If you really want a laptop that is relatively easy to upgrade or repair, buy the most configurable one you can find. That will usually be a ThinkPad or similar business laptop, or a machine from one of the suppliers that builds to order in the UK, such as <a href=\"https://www.chillblast.com/?target=search&amp;categoryId=404&amp;sortBy=p.price&amp;sortOrder=asc\">Chillblast</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pcspecialist.co.uk/custom-laptops/\">PC Specialist</a>.</p> <p>Lenovo typically offers some ThinkPads pre-configured to meet popular demand, which can be shipped the next day, and some that let you select exactly the configuration you want. This usually includes four or more choices of processor and storage, and in some cases, the choice of four different screens. It won\u2019t ship the next day, but you will get the spec you want.</p> <p>Otherwise, you will have to do a bit of research. The quickest approach is to check Crucial\u2019s local website. The company is owned by a chip manufacturer, Micron, and sells memory sticks and both M.2 and hard drive-replacement SSDs. If you have a PC, Crucial\u2019s software can examine it and show you compatible upgrades. If you don\u2019t, you can search for it (eg <a href=\"https://uk.crucial.com/gbr/en/compatible-upgrade-for/Lenovo/thinkpad-t490s\">crucial uk thinkpad T490s</a>) or go through the menu system to find possible upgrades for whatever you are thinking of buying. Once you know what will fit, you can buy from other sources, though Crucial does guarantee that its upgrades are compatible.</p> <p>When it comes to other parts, download the laptop\u2019s repair manual, which is usually available as a pdf file. This will tell you which parts are FRUs (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-replaceable_unit\">field replaceable units</a>). If an FRU goes wrong, the manufacturer (or a third-party supplier) will ship you the part so that you can change it yourself. Other parts need expert repairers.</p> <p>Installing an FRU can be fiddly, and sometimes needs special tools or new cables or whatever. The next step is therefore to search for a YouTube video where someone shows how they did the upgrade in question. Many of these videos are badly made, but that doesn\u2019t matter. You only need to see which bits need to be unscrewed and how easily they fit back together.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/\">iFixit</a> website is well known for disassembling devices and giving them a score for repairability, which is great if they\u2019ve covered your potential purchase. They mainly teardown <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/News/what-did-samsung-change-in-the-galaxy-fold-find-out-in-our-galaxy-fold-video-teardown\">high-profile machines</a>, so they probably haven\u2019t.

      "body": "<p>The internet was billed as this great bringer of democracy, the crasher-down of barriers and elites, and then it turned out the opposite was true, and democracy was crashed by a load of trollbots. Cooking, however, really has been democratised. Last century, the window for televised recipes was incredibly narrow: the rules were, you could have a cookery show if you\u2019d had five already. There was a golden ticket for one young person (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/oct/19/jack-monroe-on-jamie-oliver-the-cooks-cook\" title=\"\">Jamie Oliver</a>) and one beautiful person (Nigella Lawson), an outrageous dart of fortune, like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Now anyone with a phone can film themselves making dinner, and the result is, if nothing else, a true yardstick of what other people like.</p> <p>And what they like, it seems, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jan/09/lean-in-15s-joe-wicks-i-dont-understand-the-clean-eating-thing-ive-just-had-bangers-and-mash\" title=\"\">Joe Wicks, AKA @thebodycoach</a>, 2.8 million followers on Instagram, most famous for Lean in 15, dishes in which you cram a vegetable into every crevice, as if you were feeding a fussy but not very acute child. His first love is fitness, rather than food, and his sheer commitment to nutrients is extraordinary. There is nowhere he won\u2019t wedge a cauliflower. Lots of the recipes specifically reference this slyness (\u201cHidden veggie mac and cheese\u201d) although, surely, if you cooked from this a lot, you would realise there was a pureed butternut squash at the bottom of everything.</p> <p>But you know what? A lot of it is delicious. It\u2019s an entirely different sensibility from middle-aged chefs who have been cooking all their lives, wondering what difference it makes to use <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/saba-grape-must-balsamic_n_5901534\" title=\"\">saba</a> or balsamic. The main thing you can taste is wholesomeness; you want to try it on your kids, along with all your other good intentions: taking up basketball, teaching them manners \u2026</p> <p>Wicks worried a lot in the early days about his delivery \u2013 as he said in <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m00099wz\" title=\"\">an interview with Radio 4\u2019s The Food Programme</a>, he started off very monotonous and neutral. This has evolved into an incredibly high-energy, staccato delivery that climaxes on every ingredient (\u201cAdd your <em>banana</em>, squeeze in a bit of <em>lime</em>\u201d), like being shouted at under heavy shelling by someone who wants to save your life but has no time to lose.

      "bodyText": "The internet was billed as this great bringer of democracy, the crasher-down of barriers and elites, and then it turned out the opposite was true, and democracy was crashed by a load of trollbots. Cooking, however, really has been democratised. Last century, the window for televised recipes was incredibly narrow: the rules were, you could have a cookery show if you\u2019d had five already. There was a golden ticket for one young person (Jamie Oliver) and one beautiful person (Nigella Lawson), an outrageous dart of fortune, like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Now anyone with a phone can film themselves making dinner, and the result is, if nothing else, a true yardstick of what other people like. And what they like, it seems, is Joe Wicks, AKA @thebodycoach, 2.8 million followers on Instagram, most famous for Lean in 15, dishes in which you cram a vegetable into every crevice, as if you were feeding a fussy but not very acute child. His first love is fitness, rather than food, and his sheer commitment to nutrients is extraordinary. There is nowhere he won\u2019t wedge a cauliflower. Lots of the recipes specifically reference this slyness (\u201cHidden veggie mac and cheese\u201d) although, surely, if you cooked from this a lot, you would realise there was a pureed butternut squash at the bottom of everything. But you know what? A lot of it is delicious. It\u2019s an entirely different sensibility from middle-aged chefs who have been cooking all their lives, wondering what difference it makes to use saba or balsamic. The main thing you can taste is wholesomeness; you want to try it on your kids, along with all your other good intentions: taking up basketball, teaching them manners \u2026 Wicks worried a lot in the early days about his delivery \u2013 as he said in an interview with Radio 4\u2019s The Food Programme, he started off very monotonous and neutral. This has evolved into an incredibly high-energy, staccato delivery that climaxes on every ingredient (\u201cAdd your banana, squeeze in a bit of lime\u201d), like being shouted at under heavy shelling by someone who wants to save your life but has no time to lose. Even much more mellow presenters (I love Rachel, test kitchen manager at @thefeedfeed) feel duty bound to invest every foodstuff with heavy enthusiasm, the way everybody has to sound sonorous and slightly melancholy on Thought for the Day, even when they\u2019re talking about volleyball. Elsewhere, as straight cooking on TV gives way to competitive cooking (which is too emotional to watch for instructions), internet cooking is experimenting with the opposite: no emotion at all, which is to say, no words.

The ingredients come together on fast-forward, accompanied by nothing more than jaunty music, like a Disney montage of woodland creatures tidying up. You may be at the stage in your life where you don\u2019t need to watch a video of a browning chicken breast \u2013 a straight recipe will do, and all you\u2019re looking for is something you haven\u2019t thought of.

      "bodyText": "Early every morning Juanita Flores walks ten minutes down a newly paved road to climb onto a sparkling new cable car that whisks her to her job selling vegetables in a renovated market in the centre of Bolivia\u2019s capital. \u201cI get here in half the time it used to take me,\u201d she says, \u201cand in the rainy season I don\u2019t have to slosh through mud anymore.\u201d On her walk she passes a refurbished school and several multi-story new buildings, all with sewage systems and running water. She and her husband, who owns a minibus, are gradually buying their own home. \u201cI never dreamed we would be able to buy a house,\u201d she says. Such changes are evident everywhere across Bolivia, the work of a government that has invested profits from a commodity boom into infrastructure and social programs. But as the 20 October national elections approach, enthusiasm for this government is tempered by ambivalence. The president, Evo Morales, is seeking an unprecedented fourth term after 13 years in power, and in a country with long periods of authoritarian rule, the possibility of another re-election makes many nervous. \u201cIt\u2019s true that Evo\u2019s been in power too long,\u201d said hotel worker Juan Rivero in Santa Cruz. \u201cBut at the same time, this government has done a lot for us.\u201d Until recent disastrous wildfires, it seemed likely that Morales\u2019 re-election was inevitable. But the slow government response to the fires which devastated more than 4m hectares (9.9m acres) of forest and arable land provoked large demonstrations in the cities of Santa Cruz, Cochabamba and La Paz in early October. Protesters also expressed anger over Morales\u2019s efforts to remain in office, despite a previous pledge to leave at the end of his third term as stipulated by Bolivia\u2019s 2009 constitution. That commitment came immediately after he narrowly lost a February 2016 referendum his government called on whether he could stand again. A year and a half later, the country\u2019s Supreme Electoral Tribunal \u2013 chosen by a legislative assembly dominated by Morales\u2019 party \u2013 ruled that denying his candidacy was an infringement of his human rights. \u201cIf Evo wins, that\u2019s the end of democracy in Bolivia,\u201d said telecommunications clerk Gabriel Villegas, 34, who joined the Cochabamba demonstrations. Morales is modern Latin America\u2019s first indigenous president, a charismatic leader who rose to power from humble origins. Under his government, political participation and representation by indigenous peoples and women has grown. Bolivia now has the world\u2019s second highest number of female legislators and 36 indigenous languages are now officially recognized. \u201cDemocracy has two faces in Bolivia,\u201d explains political scientist Fernando Mayorga. \u201cUndoubtedly, there has been a concentration of power in the government\u2019s party, but representative capacity and citizen participation have also expanded.\u201d Morales\u2019 rivals, drawn from the fragmented center-to-right opposition, have taken advantage of public outrage over the fires. A poll ten days before the election showed former president and vice-president Carlos Mesa\u2019s projected share of the vote had risen to 26.9% while Evo\u2019s has dropped to 36.2%. But \u2013 in a reflection of the fluidity of the race \u2013 a subsequent poll showed 40% for Morales to Mesa\u2019s 22%. Without a majority, the candidate with the most votes must win 40% of the vote with a 10-point margin to prevail in the first round. The narrowing gap between Morales and Mess indicates that a runoff is a strong possibility. Much depends on the most unpredictable voting segment: urban youth. Half the population is under 25, and they are more urban, educated, and middle class than their parents\u2019 generation. Most of them have never known any government except one led by Evo. Key to Morales\u2019 ongoing support are the pragmatic economic policies that have made Bolivia the regional leader in economic growth, despite the collapse of the commodity boom in 2014. From 2006 to 2018, GDP per capita grew from $1,000 to over $3,600, according to the Inter-American Development Bank. But how long the economic good times will continue to roll is unclear however. The country has an alarming budget deficit close to 8% of GDP, the region\u2019s highest after Venezuela and Suriname, and a rising external debt. \u201cThe current level of expenditure is unsustainable going forward,\u201d said economist Javier Arevilca. Government investment has grown three-fold thanks to a huge infusion of funds after Bolivia signed its most favorable contracts ever with foreign hydrocarbons multinationals in 2006. This outlay fueled an economic boom. Brand-new construction and cars, bustling markets and conspicuous consumption have flourished like never before. The minimum wage gradually doubled in constant terms (even though enforcement is scant) and the government mandated two year-end bonuses (instead of the usual one), stipulating that 15% of it be spent on locally-made goods. Conditional cash transfers, adopted widely throughout Latin America, have delivered a small stipend to the elderly, pregnant women and children who remained in school, contributing to cutting of overall poverty in half. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to live on,\u201d said an elderly Cochabamba man, \u201cbut my wife gets it too and it covers our food costs. That\u2019s a big help.\u201d The funding for these programs stems from expanding mining, hydrocarbons exploration, soy production and cattle ranching \u2013 often financed by Chinese state capital. As a consequence, deforestation in eastern Bolivia has doubled since 2015, driven largely by growing cattle raising and soy production. Over its 13 years in power, Morales\u2019 government has moved steadily towards the center with little programmatic differences between it and the opposition. Pro-Morales election billboards promise \u201ca secure future\u201d foregrounding stability rather than the profound change he originally pledged.

The 93-year-old man, Bruno Dey, was 17 when he joined the SS-Totenkopfsturmbann (Death\u2019s Head Battalion), which manned the watchtowers at the concentration camp east of what is now the city of Gda\u0144sk, in Poland. Between August 1944 and April 1945, Dey is accused of having been an accessory to the murder of 5,230 people. The figure includes 5,000 prisoners who fell victim to a typhus epidemic due to being denied access to food, water and medication as well as catastrophic hygiene conditions, 200 people who were gassed with Zyklon B and 30 people executed with a device specially built for killing with a shot in the neck.

The prosecution disagrees, arguing that especially by late 1944 it would have been possible for him to fight on the eastern front instead of serving as a guard. Dey claims to have been unable to go into battle because of a heart condition. Stutthof, one of the smaller of the Nazi concentration camps, was originally set up to detain members of the Polish political leadership and intelligentsia, but was from 1944 increasingly used to hold and kill Jews transferred from the Baltic states, Hungary and the Auschwitz concentration camp. By the end of 1944, 70% of Stutthof\u2019s population was Jewish. The Hamburg trial has about 20 co-plaintiffs who spent time at Stutthof, of which four are former members of the Armia Krajowa (Home Army), the dominant resistance movement in Poland, and two are women who fought in the Warsaw uprising. Witnesses will fly in from America, Israel and Poland to give testimony in front of the court from the end of October. Even though none of the witnesses are likely to remember Dey, the trial has a high symbolic value for many of the victims. \u201cThis is not a matter of revenge,\u201d said Markus Horstmann, a lawyer representing one of the co-plaintiffs. \u201cA trial like this is for them more about seeing what happened to them declared an injustice in a German court, and about telling their story so it doesn\u2019t get forgotten,\u201d he told the Guardian. Germany\u2019s criminal justice system has allowed a number of cases against concentration camp personnel such as that in Hamburg since the 2011 landmark sentencing of John Demjanjuk, a Ukrainian prisoner who became a \u201cforeign helper\u201d to the Nazis after his capture in 1942. The trial against Demjanjuk ruled that someone could be sentenced for being a cog in the Nazi killing machine even if the prosecution could not link the accused to individual murders. Since then, the Central Office for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes, in Ludwigsburg, near Stuttgart, has been sifting through historical records in search of further cases to bring to trial. Dey came on to the radar of the centre\u2019s researchers after they found his name in the archives of the Stutthof camp\u2019s museum. While prosecutors across Germany are carrying out preliminary investigations into a further 23 similar cases of Nazi crimes, the chances of these ending up in a court are rapidly decreasing with the passage of time, as the remaining suspects are all of extremely old age. \u201cWe are continuously moving closer to the last trial of this kind,\u201d a spokesperson told the Guardian. Because Dey was 17 at the time of the alleged crimes, he will appear in front of a youth court, with the judge having to balance the severity of the crimes committed with German criminal law for young offenders, which has a maximum sentence of 10 years.",

Cunningly, though, le Carr\u00e9 wrong-foots the reader to a degree by making the character who is a mouthpiece for this criticism a rather annoying, monomaniacal, friendless geek. This is the twentysomething Ed, who befriends our narrator at his badminton club and then, after their weekly games, discourses furiously on the state of the world.</p> <p>Our narrator, of course, is a spy: Nat, 47, a member of what le Carr\u00e9 used to call \u201cthe Circus\u201d but in this book has become \u201cthe Office\u201d. Recently returned from running agents under diplomatic cover in Estonia, he is now put out to pasture in an obscure subsection of the service that keeps an eye on Russian affairs but is separate from the powerful Russian desk itself.

(A veteran spymaster named Valentina, she does all the work with her seductive voice.) Nat, meanwhile, takes a tremendously atmospheric trip to the Czech Republic to meet an old agent of his: Arkady, whom Nat had temporarily turned as a double agent against Putin\u2019s FSB. Their brief reunion is another spectacular set piece and Arkady is one of le Carr\u00e9\u2019s wonderful cameos: now a self-made kleptocrat living in maximum-security retirement, he sweats and weeps affection, but also hatred, for his former spymaster.

And the reason I do that \u2013 the reason I did that at the last election, Mr Speaker, the reason I do that is because I know that the strong economy is absolutely central to everything. <br></p> <p>It\u2019s ensuring that you have the right economic policies that provide the bedrock to create the budget that can guarantee the essential services that Australians rely on. That\u2019s exactly what our government has been doing. <br></p> <p>In season and out, despite what the global challenges are, we have continued to be able to build the strength and capability of our budget position, but also of the Australian economy which has seen now almost 1.5 million Australians get a job. <br></p> <p>Now, Mr Speaker, that is the greatest argument when it comes to the economic policies of this government and that\u2019s almost 1.5 million Australians who have got a job. That\u2019s - that\u2019s the great evidence, Mr Speaker, of 1.5 million almost lives of Australians that have been transformed because as a result of the policies of this government that has set the framework and economy for people to go and invest and take people on, Australians\u2019 lives have been changed because the Liberal Party and Nationals believe that strong economic management, that disciplined and stable and certain financial policies are what actually at the end of the day guarantee our ability to reach record levels of hospital funding, record levels of education funding, and in the midst of what is a very severe drought, Mr Speaker, that we could again today confirm that those who would be coming off the farm household allowance will be given a $13,000 payment as a supplementary payment and just over $7,000 - $7,500, Mr Speaker, for individuals to continue to support them. <br></p> <p>And we\u2019re able to do this within the constraints of the budget which has been brought back to surplus. <br></p> <p>As I remarked in this place some time ago, the Leader of the Opposition, he wants to have debates. I\u2019m getting on with things. <br></p> <p>But how can the Leader of the Opposition have a debate when he can\u2019t tell us what his tax policy is, what his climate change policy is or any other critical issues that he fails to answer questions on a daily basis. <br></p> <p>He hasn\u2019t got a policy agenda, Mr Speaker. The reason we have to talk about their record in government and their policy agenda from the last election is they haven\u2019t had any policies since that time. <br></p> <p>So it is absolutely fair for the Australian people, Mr Speaker, to hold them to their record of the policies they took to the last election and they were condemned for those policies by the Australian people at that time. We will continue, Mr Speaker, to deliver the policies that were confirmed at the last election - policies that over the last six years have created more almost 1.5 million jobs for Australians.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-17T03:58:45.964Z\">at 4.58am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5da7e48d8f083d8b3b9dd6b0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-17T03:50:48.198Z\">4.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>To his credit, <strong>Dave Sharma</strong> manages to look a little embarrassed asking the next dixer, especially when he gets to the \u2018alternative views\u2019 part.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s terrible when bad questions happen to good members,\u201d<strong> Ed Husic </strong>says.</p> <p>He is very much making hay from his backbench position.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5da7e4818f084862358ff922\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-17T03:48:21.797Z\">4.48am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>We are just about 3/4 through this and we have had 11 mentions of \u201cpanic\u201d and eight uses of \u201ccrises\u201d from government ministers in response to Labor questions.</p> <p>Deidre bloody Chambers!<br></p> <p>It\u2019s almost like they ... have talking notes ... on ... a ... phrase they would like to catch on.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-17T03:56:22.316Z\">at 4.56am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5da7e3e38f083d8b3b9dd6a9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-17T03:46:13.120Z\">4.46am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Anthony Albanese </strong>to <strong>Scott Morrison:</strong></p> <p>My question is again addressed to the Prime Minister.

Mr Speaker, the tantrums of the Leader of the Opposition in this place only re-enforce their addiction to panic and crisis on the Labor Party. They love panic. They love crisis. <br></p> <p> And even when, Mr Speaker - even when circumstances don\u2019t bear their argument out, they seek to create them, Mr Speaker, because they will look to any excuse to put their hands in the pockets of the Australian people and to rapidly increase spending to a reckless level. <br></p> <p>I referred earlier, Mr Speaker, to the catalogue of Labor Party failures in government when it came to policy. <br></p> <p>And the reason they engaged in those failures is they could never break their cycle of panic and crisis. <br></p> <p> They put in ill-considered measures, they didn\u2019t think them through, they just smashed them through and in the Australian community and Australians have been paying for them ever since. <br></p> <p>At the last election I said, \u201cYou vote Labor once, you pay for it for the next decade\u201d, and it seems exactly the same thing is true under this Leader of the Opposition. He can throw as many tantrums that he likes, we\u2019ll just get on with the job of good government. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5da7dc5e8f083d8b3b9dd67c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-17T03:15:53.768Z\">4.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There are quite a few high school students in the gallery today, who are looking very bemused at how they arrived at this place.</p> <p>Samesies.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-17T03:19:28.511Z\">at 4.19am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5da7dbca8f084862358ff8f3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-17T03:13:16.955Z\">4.13am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It\u2019s another lickspittle to the prime minister on the economy.</p> <p>But rest assured - <strong>Michael McCormack </strong>will get his moment to pretend he still has ownership over drought policy as the Nationals leader.

Yesterday the prime minister refused to debate the economy in this House. Will he debate today whether the IMF was wrong to downgrade Australia\u2019s economic growth forecast? <br></p> <p><strong>Morrison:</strong></p> <p>As I confirmed yesterday, the IMF ... midyear budget update and of course at budget time. So that is the normal process in terms of budget forecast and other forecasts that are presented here or elsewhere. <br></p> <p>And so that is a matter of public record, Mr Speaker. <br></p> <p>We have made no commentary regarding the accuracy of others\u2019 forecasts because the government provides forecasts of its own as part of the midyear budget process. <br></p> <p>We\u2019ll be doing that when it comes to the end of the year in the normal course of events, but given I have been asked about forecasts and economic data, Mr Speaker, I\u2019m very pleased to report to the House today that employment has increased by 14,000 jobs in the month of September. <br></p> <p>And that was in line with the expectations \u2013 around 15,000 jobs, Mr Speaker, and I can say that we are rapidly approaching a 1.5m jobs since this government was first elected and I can also inform the House that this monthly increase in jobs in this last month, jobs have increased every month for the last three years under this government and that is the longest run, I\u2019m advised, of consecutive monthly jobs growth ever, Mr Speaker. <br></p> <p>This government has reduced the level of unemployment from 5.7 to 5.2% and also decreased the level of youth unemployment by also a full percentage point, Mr Speaker, over that period of time. <br></p> <p>This government is doing the work through patient, through methodical, through stable, through disciplined economic policies whether it\u2019s ensuring Australians can keep more of what they earn, or investing $100 billion in the infrastructure that the Australian economy needs to grow, investing and ensuring that we\u2019re putting the right skills programs in place to enable people in this country to get the skills they need for the jobs that are there, Mr Speaker, and supporting business in the same way. <br></p> <p>Reducing the costs for business whether it\u2019s in the industrial relations area, and I commend the minister for the work he\u2019s doing, looking through all the things that are preventing people from getting jobs and costing unnecessarily the process of getting jobs and the work that the assistant minister is doing in stripping away regulations that is cost investment in this country. <br></p> <p>We\u2019re expanding our trade horizons, lifting the percentage of trade agreements that cover our trade from 26% to 70 %. Our economic plan, the calm, measured, stable certain plan just gets on with the job of delivering for Australians and the increase of almost 15,000 jobs, Mr Speaker, 26,200 full-time jobs, bears that out. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-17T03:14:36.884Z\">at 4.14am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5da7d9718f084862358ff8df\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-17T03:01:27.804Z\">4.01am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Given the Indigenous recognition push, this will be interesting.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PatsKarvelas/status/1184665387498999808\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Interview will be on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RNDrive?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@RNDrive</a> after 6pm too <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/auspol?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#auspol</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/zsXIsTvDFY\">https://t.co/zsXIsTvDFY</a></p>&mdash; PatriciaKarvelas (@PatsKarvelas) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PatsKarvelas/status/1184665387498999808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 17, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-17T03:05:38.687Z\">at 4.05am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5da7d8f98f083d8b3b9dd668\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-17T03:00:25.015Z\">4.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Scott Morrison</strong> has walked into the chamber with <strong>David Littleproud.</strong></p> <p>See?

It\u2019s complicated and has changed over the years but essentially:</p> <p>The fast-track assessment and removal process was introduced in 2014, and later expanded. It applies to the group of people who sought asylum in Australia by boat from August 2012 to January 2014 (and any of their children) commonly referred to as the \u201clegacy caseload\u201d and numbered more than 30,000.</p> <p>Under the process, asylum seekers can only apply for three-year temporary protection visas (TPV) or five-year Safe Haven Enterprise Visas (Shev), and are denied access to a full administrative review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. A refusal will automatically receive a limited review by the Immigration Assessment Authority (which was established for this purpose and sits within the AAT), but the IAA won\u2019t hear new information.</p> <p>Some fast-track applicants are excluded from this.</p> <p>The process is controversial, with some legal and refugee experts criticising it as being more focused on speed than fairness. </p> <p>The Greens and Labor motion seeks to scrap an expansion of the process to cover people from the legacy cohort reapplying after their TPV or Shev expires, as well as anyone who arrived by air and who applies for temporary protection. It applies to any application made after 1 April this year.</p> <p>Immigration minister <strong>David Coleman</strong> told the Australian this would result in application assessment times blowing out from an average of 23 days to 504 days and would put more strain on the AAT.</p> <p>Labor disputes the figures, claiming that as of February last year the average time (from lodgement to a primary decision) was 415 days for TPVs and 316 for Shevs. </p> <p>\u201cLabor does not support the government\u2019s unfair fast track process because it is neither fast nor fair \u2013 if it was the third term Liberal government would have been able to process these applications by now,\u201d said a spokesman for shadow home affairs minister, <strong>Kristina Keneally</strong>.<br></p> <p>Greens senator <strong>Nick McKim</strong> said the fast track process was neither fast nor fair.</p> <p>\u201cIt should be scrapped altogether, not expanded,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cIt was set up with the clear aim of reducing people\u2019s chances of claiming asylum and denying them avenues of appeal.

Donations should be disclosed to the public in real-time and include income from \u201cparty fundraisers, corporate sponsorship of business forums, and membership fees over $600 per year\u201d.</p> <p>Electoral expenditure should be capped, and advertising limited by the finance or attorney-general\u2019s department, which would purchase advertising space and distribute it to parties, candidates, and third parties.<br></p> <p>The centre also wants to see stronger post-separation employment bans apply to former ministers and parliamentary secretaries, preventing them from lobbying-related activities for five years in any area linked to their former portfolio.</p> <p>The ban would be enforced by an independent parliamentary integrity commissioner. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe Commonwealth has the weakest integrity laws in the country.

It is an incredibly difficult space to work in. And look, we are really grateful for the Morrison government\u2019s commitment to look at this and to work with us in developing this new strategy.

Now we are going through a tough time and we\u2019ve continued to have these conditions over our whole agricultural history, but we\u2019ve faced up to them, and we\u2019ve continued to work through them.

talking about the drought on his Sky News show the next night, broke down crying.<br></p> <p>I\u2019m not sure if that counts as \u201cfrothing at the mouth\u201d but I\u2019m also pretty sure there will be some raised eyebrows when the comment gets back to some of those metropolitan offices. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-16T23:35:41.037Z\">at

Siggghh Helen Davidson also had this story today: An Afghan doctor who was transferred to Australia from Manus Island for medical care has died in Brisbane. Sayed Mirwais Rohani had been in Australia for around two years, after more than four years on Manus Island. The 32-year-old Hazara man is believed to have taken his own life, and is the 13th death of a person sent to Manus Island or Nauru by Australia under its offshore immigration system. Rohani\u2019s father is a refugee living in the UK with his wife, and he travelled to Manus Island in 2016 seeking his son\u2019s release to join him in the UK. The spokesman for the Refugee Action Coalition, Ian Rintoul, said that request was denied because Rohani was not a minor. \u2022 Crisis support services can be reached 24 hours a day: Lifeline 13 11 14;Suicide Call Back Service 1300 659 467; Kids Helpline 1800 55 1800; MensLine Australia 1300 78 99 78 Arthur Sinodinos, who is doing his farewell tour across the parliament (he\u2019s off to Washington), was asked by Patricia Karvelas what message his colleagues should take from his valedictory speech yesterday: Look, ultimately it\u2019s up to people what messages they take out of it. I think that is a message. I think one of the other messages is that ultimately this is a team game. And you have to accept in politics you can\u2019t always do what you want, even as a backbencher. You\u2019re part of a team and government only works if it\u2019s a team. There will also be a lot of media bigwigs in Canberra tomorrow \u2013 the media freedom inquiry will hold a public hearing. The medevac senate report is due to be handed down tomorrow. Amanda Stoker led the committee, which is government heavy, so I think we can assume it is going to recommend the legislation be repealed. Labor and the Greens are expected to enter in dissenting reports. Then, when the senate returns in November, it will all be up to Jacqui Lambie. In the meantime, Helen Davidson had this story: The Australian Border Force transferred a seriously mentally ill man to Perth from Melbourne, where a youth mental health facility was preparing to treat him \u2013 then took almost a month to bring him back. On Tuesday, after being flown 2,700km across the country, admitted to hospital emergency or psychiatric departments six times, held in various forms of detention, then flying another 2,700km, the young man was finally taken to the facility that had originally offered to treat him. The shock early-morning transfer from the Melbourne detention centre, Mita, to Perth, was on a commercial Qantas flight \u2013 just one day after the Qantas chief executive, Alan Joyce, proclaimed that the company would not be silent on social issues. The young asylum seeker was removed from the Melbourne detention centre in the early hours of 19 September, allegedly without warning and without consulting the external health professionals who were arranging to have him readmitted to the Melbourne facility. No reason for the transfer was given, as far as Guardian Australia is aware. This is not a sight you will see too often \u2013 an LNP senator sitting with the crossbench, against the government. Susan McDonald chaired the committee that recommended the additional maintenance requirements be removed from charity flight operators \u2013 which is what Rex Patrick is calling for. Labor voted with the government. And from this, I think you can infer from this answer on the voice to parliament, Ken Wyatt has set out that the government will be pushing to legislate, before heading to the referendum Patricia Karvelas: You do know you\u2019ll break a lot of hearts by not putting the voice to the people? Ken Wyatt: We also have to be pragmatic and that\u2019s a reality. PK: But do you acknowledge you\u2019re going to break a lot of people\u2019s hearts? KW: Some people have told me it will break their hearts. We have to think about whether we want to be recognised in the Constitution. PK: What\u2019s the point of recognition without power, Senator? KW: Recognition was in section 127 in the Constitution but in the sense of not allowing us to be counted. 127 was struck out. The 1967 referendum created a number of myths around what it really meant to people. The reality was, was the striking out of that and then the amendment, the 51-26. This requires further work on what are the sets of words that recognise this within the Constitution. 51-26 has been predominantly used for Indigenous Australians to support Commonwealth legislation on very critical issues such as the Mabo decision, land rights, etc ... What I don\u2019t want to see is that removed totally which then leaves a challenge in terms of the legitimacy of those. PK: Would you like to see it changed? KW: I\u2019m going to wait to see what comes out. I\u2019ve been meeting with people and there is a degree of willingness to have recognition. I think that once we work through whatever the voice is, and that may give us another option. What I suspect will happen is that we may legislate first and then when that\u2019s successful, then we can go back for the next bite of the Constitution. On the legislated voice issue, Ken Wyatt says he is pushing ahead: Well, we\u2019ve got a timetable I\u2019m proposing to take to the PM. Once that\u2019s been agreed to in the process that he and I will undertake, and my cabinet colleagues and certainly members of parliament, then we will announce that and we will clearly lay out the process and the structures that are within that. Patricia Karvelas: What about if people don\u2019t want a legislated voice? KW: I suspect that if we went with a nebulous notion of a voice to the greater Australian public, it would not have the support. Constitutional recognition, with the exception of John Howard\u2019s referendum, tends not to come back as a question to be put at a later stage. Local government is slightly different because people have fought to try and get local government recognised in the constitution and we\u2019ve had parliamentary committees deal with that. But I don\u2019t want to see us lose an opportunity. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to do, do it very steadily. I don\u2019t want this to be rushed that we get it wrong and that we lose it. When I look at the referendums that have been successful, Labor was successful with one on social services. That\u2019s because Bob Menzies is the leader and did not oppose what Labor had done to the Australian public. In a sense there was this bipartisan support. But you need both sides to the political divide. PK: What process have you gone through now to get Labor on board? It is meant to be bipartisan. KW: I\u2019m having dinner with my colleagues on an evening that we have chosen next week \u2013 the Indigenous members of the parliament who are predominantly Labor. PK: In terms of the timeline, I know you\u2019re taking this to the PM, can you give me an indication of the kind of timeframe that you think is workable. KW: It is before the next election because we don\u2019t a referendum tied in with an election. There is an unintended consequence of that we don\u2019t need. It\u2019s important we have this pristine space in which the question can be put, the debate\u2019s had andAustralians make the decision. PK: You think you can have a referendum on recognition before the next election? KW: I\u2019m optimistic. Patricia Karvelas: Many Indigenous people are opposed to this idea of legislating the voice. Have you convinced them? Ken Wyatt: No. I haven\u2019t. But we will start a process. I\u2019ve been talking to a lot of people as I\u2019ve moved across the nation. Issues like sovereignty come up. Communities say, \u201cWho will listen to our voice? We want local issues and access to health, better education.\u201d I think Linda Burney discovered that when she travelled from Port Hedland to Uluru because I saw her and she made the very pertinent point \u2013 they were concerned about local matters that needed resolving. PK: In terms of a proposal for changing the Constitution, you\u2019ve made it quite clear to the disappointment of many that you don\u2019t want the voice to be in the Constitution. So what will constitutional change look like under the Morrison Government? KW: We will work through those over the next 12 months. PK: Can you give me some parameters? KW: There will be recognition. PK: What will that look like? KW: That will need to be worked through with our people. And has to be acceptable within a legal framework. What I don\u2019t want is a section 44 issue being created. We have to be pragmatic and have many non-Indigenous Australians who are supportive but are saying, \u201cI\u2019m concerned until you tell us what the sets of words are because I\u2019m not going to commit to something that creates a division between a nation that is becoming more unified.\u201d The number of non-indigenous people who have said, \u201cWe will stand with Indigenous Australians. We want to see them recognised but get the words right.\u201d On the ABC, Patricia Karvelas has an interview with Ken Wyatt about where the plan for Indigenous reconciliation is at. We will announce in the very near future a working group that will define the voice but will take in to consideration local, regional, state and national approaches. One of the things I\u2019ve made very clear to state and territory ministers is they already have voices ... I don\u2019t want to take them out of the equation. There will be a substantial piece of work that will be undertaken and as soon as I finalise it, crossing a couple of Ts and dotting some Is then we\u2019ll start the process. PK: My understanding is you\u2019re about to take that proposal to the PM. Can you give me an indication of what is in that proposal? KW: I can\u2019t do that until I\u2019ve had a discussion with my leader. PK: Am I right you are about to take a proposal to the PM for a way forward on legislation to actually establish a voice in this term of parliament? KW: What I\u2019ll be doing is taking forward a series of propositions to do with constitutional recognition, the voice and truth telling. Each of those are separate pieces of work because they are critical in their own right. But what I also want to do is talk about the way in which government will take elements of that forward as we co-design. I\u2019m seriously committed to working through with our people to a solution that they\u2019re comfortable with as well, not just as we\u2019ve always done in the past, come forward with the voices of a few. And then made a decision. Rex Patrick has been fighting to have the aviation body, Casa, reduce the number of maintenance requirements on charity aircrafts, and adopt the NZ model. Over in the Senate, new LNP senator Susan McDonald is crossing the floor to support a motion from Rex Patrick This is either \u201cwaiting for a mate\u201d, or \u201csorry, it\u2019s saved\u201d, depending on your generation. Question time as seen by Mike Bowers Scott Morrison, playing the role of today\u2019s mood (as captured by Mike Bowers) And we are done. The folders are very stacked though. Hopefully this means we are coming to the end. Nope. Scott Morrison just raised a finger and said \u201cone more\u201d to Tony Smith. It\u2019s on the Prime Minister\u2019s Science Prize. So at least it\u2019s a worthy dixer. We\u2019re at the swap sides of the chamber stage of the latest farce Luke Howarth and Andrew Laming have both made beelines for the frontbench this time round. Christian Porter seems very confused about whether or not there is a motion before the House. Tony Smith seems very confused about why Christian Porter is confused. Tony Burke is now trying to explain to Christian Porter about how the motion process works. Tony Smith is now agreeing with Tony Burke while still trying to work out why Christian Porter is confused. And now we all have to sit here for another four minutes because that whole explanation of standing orders took so long, Smith has to extend the bells. \u201cBring back Christopher,\u201d Anthony Albanese yells. Christian Porter has been confused into silence, so I guess there has been some silver lining. Labor is attempting to suspend standing orders, to debate the economy. It will fail. Obviously. Joel Fitzgibbon is taking the silences in between the divisions to troll Michael McCormack about his press conference being overshadowed by the prime minister\u2019s radio interview, where he made the same announcement, but got in first. National MPs are still sending \u2018can\u2019t believe that happened\u2019 messages. Good times all round. Stay with me folks. My computer program is struggling. I know the feeling. After a Senate estimates session dominated by two topics \u2013 the economy and raising Newstart \u2013 Labor\u2019s Kristina Keneally has asked Mathias Cormann three ways why the prime minister has repeatedly refused to deny that he sought to have Brian Houston invited to the White House. Cormann is keeping the answers simple - he has nothing further to add to what Scott Morrison has said. Labor MPs are calling out \u201cwhat are you hiding?\u201d Seems they\u2019ll need Senate Estimates next week, or maybe to bring out medieval instruments of torture like thumbscrews, to get to the bottom of this. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question is again addressed to the Prime Minister: Yesterday in the Parliament the Prime Minister shut down a proposed debate on the economy and organised an additional question to himself so that only he could talk about the economy. Is that because the Prime Minister only wants to listen to himself? Will the Prime Minister agree to a debate on the economy today or doesn\u2019t he have the confidence in his own economic management? Morrison: When the Labor Party can confirm what their actual policies are, maybe that\u2019s when they want to start asking those questions. That\u2019s the entire answer. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Former prime ministers John Howard, Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull all facilitated parliamentary debate at this time in the parliament on important economic issues facing the nation. Does the prime minister have the confidence in his economic position to be able to swallow his pride, follow their example and agree to a debate on the state of the economy today? Morrison: Every time, almost without exempt exemption, I come to this despatch Box, I\u2019m talking about our economic policies. And the reason I do that \u2013 the reason I did that at the last election, Mr Speaker, the reason I do that is because I know that the strong economy is absolutely central to everything. It\u2019s ensuring that you have the right economic policies that provide the bedrock to create the budget that can guarantee the essential services that Australians rely on. That\u2019s exactly what our government has been doing. In season and out, despite what the global challenges are, we have continued to be able to build the strength and capability of our budget position, but also of the Australian economy which has seen now almost 1.5 million Australians get a job. Now, Mr Speaker, that is the greatest argument when it comes to the economic policies of this government and that\u2019s almost 1.5 million Australians who have got a job. That\u2019s - that\u2019s the great evidence, Mr Speaker, of 1.5 million almost lives of Australians that have been transformed because as a result of the policies of this government that has set the framework and economy for people to go and invest and take people on, Australians\u2019 lives have been changed because the Liberal Party and Nationals believe that strong economic management, that disciplined and stable and certain financial policies are what actually at the end of the day guarantee our ability to reach record levels of hospital funding, record levels of education funding, and in the midst of what is a very severe drought, Mr Speaker, that we could again today confirm that those who would be coming off the farm household allowance will be given a $13,000 payment as a supplementary payment and just over $7,000 - $7,500, Mr Speaker, for individuals to continue to support them. And we\u2019re able to do this within the constraints of the budget which has been brought back to surplus. As I remarked in this place some time ago, the Leader of the Opposition, he wants to have debates. I\u2019m getting on with things. But how can the Leader of the Opposition have a debate when he can\u2019t tell us what his tax policy is, what his climate change policy is or any other critical issues that he fails to answer questions on a daily basis. He hasn\u2019t got a policy agenda, Mr Speaker. The reason we have to talk about their record in government and their policy agenda from the last election is they haven\u2019t had any policies since that time. So it is absolutely fair for the Australian people, Mr Speaker, to hold them to their record of the policies they took to the last election and they were condemned for those policies by the Australian people at that time. We will continue, Mr Speaker, to deliver the policies that were confirmed at the last election - policies that over the last six years have created more almost 1.5 million jobs for Australians. To his credit, Dave Sharma manages to look a little embarrassed asking the next dixer, especially when he gets to the \u2018alternative views\u2019 part. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible when bad questions happen to good members,\u201d Ed Husic says. He is very much making hay from his backbench position. We are just about 3/4 through this and we have had 11 mentions of \u201cpanic\u201d and eight uses of \u201ccrises\u201d from government ministers in response to Labor questions. Deidre bloody Chambers! It\u2019s almost like they ... have talking notes ... on ... a ... phrase they would like to catch on. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question is again addressed to the Prime Minister. Given that yesterday the Treasurer falsely claimed that drought was the number 1 call on the budget, will the Prime Minister agree to have a debate on Australia\u2019s economy and in particular the plight of farmers today based upon the facts? Morrison: Mr Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition seems quite insistent on this point. But he obviously wasn\u2019t insistent this morning because the matter of public importance which has been tabled today by the federal member for Barton does not mention the word \u201ceconomy\u201d at all, Mr Speaker. The word \u201ceconomy\u201d... is not even in it. So, Mr Speaker, if he can\u2019t get his own side to agree about something, and that\u2019s not uncommon at the moment, Mr Speaker, it\u2019s not uncommon... I know that the Labor Party\u2019s penchant is for panic and crisis, Mr Speaker, but honestly - he\u2019s got to try to resolve the panic and crisis that is going on within his own party on so many issues. Whether it\u2019s on - their response to climate, which they say is an emergency, but we\u2019re not going to know their policy about it until the next election. And in between times, we\u2019re going of the constant infighting between the member for Hunter and the member for South Australia... What is it again? Hindmarsh. The member for Hindmarsh, or member for Sydney or any other members. Or whether the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party is going to tear itself apart. Not only ridden by corruption but also seemed today by sexism as well, Mr Speaker. The leader of the Labor Party has got plenty on his plate and so I\u2019ll leave him to deal with that all on his own measure Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question is again addressed to the Prime Minister. Given that yesterday the Treasurer falsely claimed that drought was the number 1 call on the budget, will the Prime Minister agree to have a debate on Australia\u2019s economy and in particular the plight of farmers today based upon the facts?

Not only ridden by corruption but also seemed today by sexism as well, Mr Speaker. The leader of the Labor Party has got plenty on his plate and so I\u2019ll leave him to deal with that all on his own measure Angus Taylor actually just uttered the words \u201cwe are unified on energy and climate policy on this side of the House,\u201d with a straight face, and honestly, I now understand how he got that Rhodes scholarship. It\u2019s Peter Dutton HOW SAFE ARE YOU time! How safe are we today, Peter Dutton? Well, Australia, I\u2019m really glad you asked. You are as safe as we can make you. BUT JUST IMAGINE IF LABOR WAS IN POWER. THE CHAOS. THE PANIC. THE KRAKENS! WHY, THE TRIFFIDS WOULD RISE UP. Thankfully Australia, you have Peter Dutton. So it\u2019s all cool beans. Dutton finishes. Ed Husic: \u201cYeah, but you choose Greg [Hunt] as your deputy leader. It\u2019s TRUE.\u201d Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question is again addressed to the prime minister. Given wage growth is the lowest it\u2019s ever been, household debt is at record highs and consumer confidence is at a four-year low, why does the prime minister dismiss the role that this parliament has to play in debating the economic policy direction of the nation? Or doesn\u2019t he have the confidence in his own position to be able to do so? Morrison: It\u2019s all about you, isn\u2019t it?! Through you, Mr Speaker! It\u2019s about the Australian people, Mr Speaker. We debate these matters in the parliament everyday as the measures that we ... Apparently, Mr Speaker, when we bring legislation into this parliament that deals with economic measures, they\u2019re apparently not debated in this place. The Leader of the Opposition has been here long enough to know that this debating chamber deals with copious pieces of legislation, Mr Speaker, and there is ample time. Now, before the election - next election, Mr Speaker, there will be the opportunity for the types of things that the Leader of the Opposition is speaking about and I have no doubt that will be the case as it is on every other occasion. But, Mr Speaker, it seems the debate he needs to have is within his own party because within his own party, they have got the climate fight club going on over there with umpteen different positions on climate change and, Mr Speaker, he\u2019s got his own problems when it comes to the distractions of the New South Wales branch where I see compensation payments are measured in how many Aldi bags they\u2019re handing out. [This bit was very, very loud.] Tony Smith pulls him up on relevance. Morrison: I\u2019m in this place every single day talking about the economy. When we came to government, the real wage growth through the year was 0.5% and now today it\u2019s 0.7%. I note the comments of the most recent RBA minutes and it says this, \u201cDespite the level of high household debt in Australia, relative to other countries, the risks from household debt appear to have been mostly contained. Members noted that households continue to have large repayments on their housing debt and aggregate mortgage repayments equal to 2.5 years of repayment.\u201d Mr Speaker, whether it comes to what we\u2019re doing on jobs, whether it comes to what we\u2019re doing in restoring the budget to surplus to ensure we\u2019re there not only to meet the needs of today but we\u2019re thinking ahead to meet the needs of tomorrow because we know how to keep our heads, to keep calm, Mr Speaker, and to ensure we continue to lay out the policies which we know are having the impact that they need to have and particularly in relation to employment. Employment in this country is the beginning of everything. Michael McCormack is summoned to the despatch box, and the longest three minutes of all our lifes begins anew. Empires have risen and fallen in this time. It\u2019s amazing how he can make every minute feel like an hour. It\u2019s Bob Katter time. He wants to know about a drought/dam plan. Are you aware that the PM after the north\u2019s flooding cattle deaths came, listened and delivered two dams and $200m. At the drought summit in contrast, did you not say that the free market is not necessarily benevolent, we must learn to accept climate change, we cannot carry you forever. Ideology \u2013 where is the survival plan? Isn\u2019t this the policy of the corporate elites when you buy up owner-operator Australia and the city suits enriched by selling to foreigners. Have you stopped a single sale? Minister, who is the master that you serve? He directs the question to David Littleproud, who tells him that was a question for the treasurer, but that the government is working to do what it can, but needs the states to come on board. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Can the Prime Minister confirm that since 2002 only two Australian Treasurers have presided over an unemployment rate that is higher than the OECD average? Will the Prime Minister agree to have a debate in this Parliament on Australia\u2019s economy today? And will he admit the only two Treasurers who have had an unemployment rate that is higher than the OECD average are the current Treasurer and himself? Morrison: I\u2019m interested in the jobs of Australians. Hear, hear. That\u2019s what I\u2019m interested in. The Leader of the Opposition is clearly only interested in his own job because all he wants to do is have a talk-fest in this place. I\u2019m interested in the jobs of Australians. And taking action to ensure Australians are in work. Mr Speaker, more and more Australians in work and more Australians are in work today as a share of the Australian population than at any other time in Australia\u2019s history. So, Mr Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition may be thinking that this place, Mr Speaker, and the chatter that goes on here is terribly important to him and his position. I\u2019m going to remain focused on those Australians, Mr Speaker, who simply want us to get on the job, on with the job, of ensuring we\u2019re providing the stable and the calm and the responsible financial management which has brought the budget back to the surplus. Albanese stands up for a point of order, and Morrison goes to sit down, but not before saying what sounds like \u2018another spurious point of order\u2019 Albanese: There were two parts to the question. One part went to whether the current Treasurer and the current Prime Minister are the only two Australian Treasurers who... Yeah... He hasn\u2019t mentioned that. The second is if he\u2019s confident let\u2019s have a debate about it. Tony Smith: No, I was just going to say to the Leader of the Opposition - whilst there\u2019s additional tolerance extended to him because of his position and to the Prime Minister, points of order are not going to be used to ask another question or to make a political statement. There were two parts to the question. The Prime Minister can address one or the other or both. That\u2019s the way it works. The Prime Minister has the call. Morrison: The Leader of the Opposition may want to come into this place and throw a tantrum at Question Time. Over whether or not someone\u2019s going to agree to what he wants to do. He\u2019s entitled... Mr Speaker, the tantrums of the Leader of the Opposition in this place only re-enforce their addiction to panic and crisis on the Labor Party. They love panic. They love crisis. And even when, Mr Speaker - even when circumstances don\u2019t bear their argument out, they seek to create them, Mr Speaker, because they will look to any excuse to put their hands in the pockets of the Australian people and to rapidly increase spending to a reckless level. I referred earlier, Mr Speaker, to the catalogue of Labor Party failures in government when it came to policy. And the reason they engaged in those failures is they could never break their cycle of panic and crisis. They put in ill-considered measures, they didn\u2019t think them through, they just smashed them through and in the Australian community and Australians have been paying for them ever since. At the last election I said, \u201cYou vote Labor once, you pay for it for the next decade\u201d, and it seems exactly the same thing is true under this Leader of the Opposition. He can throw as many tantrums that he likes, we\u2019ll just get on with the job of good government. There are quite a few high school students in the gallery today, who are looking very bemused at how they arrived at this place. Samesies. It\u2019s another lickspittle to the prime minister on the economy. But rest assured - Michael McCormack will get his moment to pretend he still has ownership over drought policy as the Nationals leader. He\u2019s just got to wait his turn. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Given that since May the Reserve Bank, the OECD, and the International Monetary Fund have all downgraded Australia\u2019s growth forecast for this year, will the prime minister agree to have a debate in this chamber today on the economy? Morrison: I note \u2013 I understand from my colleagues that \u2013 they have listed for the MPI today [it] isn\u2019t about the economy. So I\u2019m a bit puzzled why they want one but they\u2019re not prepared to table one, Mr Speaker. I tell you what \u2013 what our government is going to do, it\u2019s not about debating the economy, it\u2019s actually about implementing the policies that make our economy stronger and that\u2019s what our government is doing. That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing, Mr Speaker. And we will continue to implement those sound and carefully-managed disciplined and stable and certain policies that as I have said today, Mr Speaker, has resulted in three years of consecutive increased in employment every single month, the longest run of jobs growth on a monthly basis this country has ever seen. So what we will do is not talk about it, we\u2019ll get on to do it. I mean, government does job is a weird flex, but cool. You do you, Morrison government. We are now hearing the same answer again, but as a dixer. Dante obviously missed a circle. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question is addressed to the prime minister. Yesterday the prime minister refused to debate the economy in this House. Will he debate today whether the IMF was wrong to downgrade Australia\u2019s economic growth forecast? Morrison: As I confirmed yesterday, the IMF ... midyear budget update and of course at budget time. So that is the normal process in terms of budget forecast and other forecasts that are presented here or elsewhere. And so that is a matter of public record, Mr Speaker. We have made no commentary regarding the accuracy of others\u2019 forecasts because the government provides forecasts of its own as part of the midyear budget process. We\u2019ll be doing that when it comes to the end of the year in the normal course of events, but given I have been asked about forecasts and economic data, Mr Speaker, I\u2019m very pleased to report to the House today that employment has increased by 14,000 jobs in the month of September. And that was in line with the expectations \u2013 around 15,000 jobs, Mr Speaker, and I can say that we are rapidly approaching a 1.5m jobs since this government was first elected and I can also inform the House that this monthly increase in jobs in this last month, jobs have increased every month for the last three years under this government and that is the longest run, I\u2019m advised, of consecutive monthly jobs growth ever, Mr Speaker. This government has reduced the level of unemployment from 5.7 to 5.2% and also decreased the level of youth unemployment by also a full percentage point, Mr Speaker, over that period of time. This government is doing the work through patient, through methodical, through stable, through disciplined economic policies whether it\u2019s ensuring Australians can keep more of what they earn, or investing $100 billion in the infrastructure that the Australian economy needs to grow, investing and ensuring that we\u2019re putting the right skills programs in place to enable people in this country to get the skills they need for the jobs that are there, Mr Speaker, and supporting business in the same way. Reducing the costs for business whether it\u2019s in the industrial relations area, and I commend the minister for the work he\u2019s doing, looking through all the things that are preventing people from getting jobs and costing unnecessarily the process of getting jobs and the work that the assistant minister is doing in stripping away regulations that is cost investment in this country. We\u2019re expanding our trade horizons, lifting the percentage of trade agreements that cover our trade from 26% to 70 %. Our economic plan, the calm, measured, stable certain plan just gets on with the job of delivering for Australians and the increase of almost 15,000 jobs, Mr Speaker, 26,200 full-time jobs, bears that out. Given the Indigenous recognition push, this will be interesting. Scott Morrison has walked into the chamber with David Littleproud. See? EVERYTHING IS FINE Who\u2019s that MP? It\u2019s Ken O\u2019Dowd. I\u2019ll be heading to the chamber for question time \u2013 hit me up with your predictions (but I would say drought and the economy would be on the money). This is an interesting story from AAP: The Canberra bubble is truly full, with countries looking to set up shop in the capital being turned away because of a lack of available land. The National Capital Authority, which manages federal land in Canberra, told a parliamentary briefing they couldn\u2019t offer much to those seeking land for diplomatic missions. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a number of countries where we\u2019ve basically said, \u2018No, we can\u2019t offer you anything\u2019,\u201d chief planner Andrew Smith said. He also told the committee negotiations with the Russian and Iranian missions to see them start works on their vacant land was ongoing. Smith said new embassies could be built for a number of reasons, including the beginning of a new diplomatic relationship with Australia or countries already stationed in Canberra looking to move out of rented premises. But some countries were also requesting larger premises for missions. \u201cWe are actually at a situation where we really can\u2019t effectively offer anything much,\u201d Smith said. He said there were a couple of vacant sites but the authority couldn\u2019t offer them due to \u201creasons associated with terrain or soil conditions\u201d. When contacted by AAP, the authority said it was up to the individual missions to confirm whether they had been turned back. The authority manages vacant sites but countries then have to look after it once they pick up the lease. It also has a \u201cuse it or lose it\u201d policy where countries may have leased land taken away from them if they show no signs of developing it. Smith told the committee negotiations with the Russian and Iranian missions to see them start works on their own missions were continuing. Last year, the committee was told that Kuwait, Iran, Brunei, Russia and Bangladesh had stalled or inactive development on their land. At the time, Iran attributed delays to the unexpected death of their embassy\u2019s new architect. It also said it was holding discussions with the ACT government on the shortage of diplomatic land. Just for a bit more context on that spat Sky\u2019s Thomas O\u2019Brien has been reporting on \u2013 the Nationals have been annoyed about how the drought policy has been handled for quite some time. There was agitation within the party when Malcolm Turnbull was prime minister, with members pushing Michael McCormack to do more. Then, when Scott Morrison took over the leadership, he also took over on the drought, which furthered angered a group of National MPs, who thought the Liberals should not be leading on a policy area which traditionally, has been theirs. So there has been angst, but a truce was called, given the drought was, from a PR point at least, a headline issue for the government. Then the announcement happened \u2013 and those tensions boiled over again. For the record, none of the National MPs are willing to go on the record to say this. But yes, they are *annoyed* Labor and the Greens are teaming up against an expansion of the fast-track visa process which among others would cover asylum seekers who arrived by plane. Contrary to some reports this morning, it is not a motion to scrap the controversial process altogether \u2013 although the Greens\u2019 position is that it should be scrapped. What is the fast-track process? It\u2019s complicated and has changed over the years but essentially: The fast-track assessment and removal process was introduced in 2014, and later expanded. It applies to the group of people who sought asylum in Australia by boat from August 2012 to January 2014 (and any of their children) commonly referred to as the \u201clegacy caseload\u201d and numbered more than 30,000. Under the process, asylum seekers can only apply for three-year temporary protection visas (TPV) or five-year Safe Haven Enterprise Visas (Shev), and are denied access to a full administrative review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. A refusal will automatically receive a limited review by the Immigration Assessment Authority (which was established for this purpose and sits within the AAT), but the IAA won\u2019t hear new information. Some fast-track applicants are excluded from this. The process is controversial, with some legal and refugee experts criticising it as being more focused on speed than fairness. The Greens and Labor motion seeks to scrap an expansion of the process to cover people from the legacy cohort reapplying after their TPV or Shev expires, as well as anyone who arrived by air and who applies for temporary protection. It applies to any application made after 1 April this year. Immigration minister David Coleman told the Australian this would result in application assessment times blowing out from an average of 23 days to 504 days and would put more strain on the AAT. Labor disputes the figures, claiming that as of February last year the average time (from lodgement to a primary decision) was 415 days for TPVs and 316 for Shevs. \u201cLabor does not support the government\u2019s unfair fast track process because it is neither fast nor fair \u2013 if it was the third term Liberal government would have been able to process these applications by now,\u201d said a spokesman for shadow home affairs minister, Kristina Keneally. Greens senator Nick McKim said the fast track process was neither fast nor fair. \u201cIt should be scrapped altogether, not expanded,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was set up with the clear aim of reducing people\u2019s chances of claiming asylum and denying them avenues of appeal. This government continues to demonise people who have fled persecution.\u201d A group of ex-judges, anti-corruption commissioners, and experts have laid out a blueprint for improving political and democratic integrity in the wake of this year\u2019s election. The Centre for Public Integrity used a submission to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters to argue there was \u201cample evidence\u201d of the need for integrity reform, pointing to the $70m campaign spend by Clive Palmer and the post-political appointments of Christopher Pyne and Julie Bishop. The centre, chaired by former NSW judge Anthony Whealy QC, wants parties and candidates to report all single donations of $1,000 or above or aggregated contributions of $3,000 over three years. The current threshold is $14,000. Donations should be disclosed to the public in real-time and include income from \u201cparty fundraisers, corporate sponsorship of business forums, and membership fees over $600 per year\u201d. Electoral expenditure should be capped, and advertising limited by the finance or attorney-general\u2019s department, which would purchase advertising space and distribute it to parties, candidates, and third parties. The centre also wants to see stronger post-separation employment bans apply to former ministers and parliamentary secretaries, preventing them from lobbying-related activities for five years in any area linked to their former portfolio. The ban would be enforced by an independent parliamentary integrity commissioner. \u201cThe Commonwealth has the weakest integrity laws in the country. Reform is crucial in the wake of the 2019 federal election,\u201d Whealy said. The Centre for Public Integrity board includes ex-judges Tony Fitzgerald QC, David Ipp QC, Stephen Charles QC and Whealy, professors George Williams and Joo Cheong Tham, and barrister Geoffrey Watson SC. Mike Bowers has been very busy this morning. This would be the moment the Nationals gathered to announce the farm household allowance changes, but were overshadowed by the prime minister who was on not-Alan Jones radio doing exactly the same thing. Some colour in parliament, thanks to a Mongolian dance troupe. A very fed up Jacqui Lambie And that Senate light Katharine Murphy and Paul Karp have put together exactly what happened when Labor voted against the Greens motion to stop the government from scrapping the education infrastructure fund, in favour of redirecting it to emergency disaster responses: Labor has done a deal with the Morrison government to pass legislation redirecting education infrastructure money to disaster relief despite significant objections from the education spokeswoman, Tanya Plibersek. The opposition made the decision to sign on to the emergency response fund in a special shadow cabinet meeting on Wednesday night, which also considered Labor\u2019s stance on the free trade deal with Indonesia. But Guardian Australia understands Plibersek objected, and concerns persist within the caucus that the decision will blunt Labor\u2019s ability to pursue the Coalition over cuts to education funding. Labor MPs, including the former research minister Kim Carr, have expressed concern that the redirection will deliver a significant blow to investment in research infrastructure. I have been flipping through some annual reports this morning. The Department of Employment provides us an update on the progress of its struggling $250m PaTH internships program. You might remember it\u2019s the scheme where the government pays businesses like Hungry Jacks and Woolworths $1000 to host young welfare recipients. The interns get an incentive payment, which unions say equates to about $4 a day. The program was supposed to offer 30,000 internships a year \u2013 instead there have only been 6,464 since April 2017. The report does say that 65% of those internships led to a job. \u201cThose who have completed Youth Jobs PaTH have achieved strong outcomes, but take-up continues to be a challenge,\u201d the report says. The government poured another $10m into the scheme in August. Nick Martin (the doctor from the post a few down) approves this message Here\u2019s the dairy industry inquiry motion Pauline Hanson put up and won (with the support of most of the Senate, excluding the government). That the following matter be referred to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee for inquiry and report by the third sitting day in March 2020: the performance of Australia\u2019s dairy industry and the profitability of Australian dairy farmers since deregulation in 2000, with particular reference to \u2013 (a) the ability of Dairy Australia to act independently and support the best interests of both farmers and processors; (b) the accuracy of statistical data collected by Dairy Australia and the Australian Bureau of Statistics; (c) the funding of Dairy Australia and the extent of its consultation and engagement on the expenditure of levies revenue; (d) the merits of tasking the ACCC to investigate how it can regulate the price of milk per litre paid by processors to dairy farmers to ensure a viable dairy industry; (e) alternative approaches to supporting a viable dairy sector; (f) the introduction of a mandatory industry code of practice; and (g) any related matters. The Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi has also unleashed on Labor for its decision not to back a motion to save the education fund (Jacqui Lambie was also very, very angry at the move). Labor and the Government have teamed up to stab education in the back by abolishing billions in education funding. I don\u2019t expect any better of the regressive Liberals who have cut education funding at every turn, but Labor used to be the party of education. Now they are just selling out communities and young people to remain politically relevant. Labor are so eager to please the Liberals they voted to abolish the infrastructure fund they themselves established. The reality is unis, Tafes and research have all suffered under this Liberal-National government. Education in Australia is being dangerously underfunded. The official Labor press conference on the free trade agreement decision is out. From Madeleine King\u2019s office: We will back these agreements, although we are concerned about how this Government will implement them. We have consulted widely on these issues with stakeholders in the union movement, industry, academia and the public service. I have written to Trade Minister Simon Birmingham seeking firm commitments to ensure that the implementation of the agreements safeguard Australian jobs and maximise market access for Australian businesses. We are seeking: A guarantee that these agreements protect Australian jobs. An assurance that working holiday makers are not exploited and are appropriately qualified for the work they undertake. The termination of the existing bilateral investment treaty with Indonesia. The termination or updating of out-dated bilateral investment treaties and investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) clauses. A review of recent ISDS mechanisms in trade agreements. An inquiry by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties (JSCOT) into Australia\u2019s treaty-making process. An assurance that there is no inference from the agreements that would require the privatisation of government services, nor restrict any future decision to bring acquire public assets. Labor\u2019s call for the Government to pursue the termination of the existing Bilateral Investment Treaty between Australia and Indonesia was recently backed by JSCOT\u2019s recent review of these trade agreements. This old treaty contains ISDS clauses with poor safeguards. Labor does not support the inclusion of ISDS provisions in trade agreements, but the report noted that the provisions in these new agreements include strong safeguards. Labor MPs on the JSCOT committee were instrumental in ensuring that these recommendations were included in the final report. Back in the Senate, One Nation put forward a motion to set up an inquiry into the \u201cperformance of Australia\u2019s dairy industry and the profitability of farmers since deregulation in 2000\u201d. Labor, the Greens and the crossbench all supported the inquiry. The government opposed it. Ayes - 33 Noes - 28 It is not often you see that section of the chamber supporting something One Nation puts up, but there you go. Just on Peter Dutton\u2019s latest intervention on medevac, I have been reminded of this story from earlier in the year: A doctor on Nauru who blew the whistle on the deliberate medical neglect of refugees and asylum seekers on the island has been awarded a global award for free speech. Dr Nick Martin, the former senior medical officer for International Health and Medical Services on Nauru, spoke out publicly against what he described as Australia\u2019s \u201cinflexible, unswerving, and shameless\u201d offshore immigration regime, that deliberately harmed asylum seekers and ignored doctors\u2019 recommendations to treat dangerously ill people. In London on Wednesday night, he was awarded the 2019 Blueprint for Free Speech prize, an award previously won by Chelsea Manning, who revealed US military abuses and suspected war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan, and John Kiriakou, the former CIA intelligence officer who revealed information about torture techniques including waterboarding. Martin is a veteran military doctor. The drug testing bill is on its way to the Senate. Labor is supporting the government\u2019s call to abolish the $4bn education investment fund (the Coalition has wanted it gone since 2014 and, when it couldn\u2019t get rid of it, just stopped spending the money from it, meaning it has sat there untouched), mostly because it doesn\u2019t want to be seen as standing in front of emergency response fund (which is where the government wants to put this money). Jacqui Lambie has been calling for more Tafe funding for Tasmania since returning to the Senate. That\u2019s why she is so angry. The money that is there, for that purpose, is now being officially taken away. Oh FFS. From AAP: Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton has claimed Australian war veterans want refugee medical evacuation laws scrapped. Mr Dutton is locked in negotiations with Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie, herself an army veteran, as he seeks to repeal the so-called medevac laws. \u201cI believe very strongly that most Australians and certainly the vast majority of veterans would want us to abolish this law,\u201d he told 2GB Radio on Thursday. There does not seem to be any evidence for this, other than Dutton is courting Lambie\u2019s swing vote on this. We were expecting a press conference on the party\u2019s position on free trade agreements after a lively caucus debate this morning, but it has now been called off. We are still waiting to get the details of what has been agreed upon, but expect something on scrapping old investor state dispute settlement clauses with Indonesia, independent economic analysis of the trade deals, and a concession on future labour market access. The unemployment figures are out That vote Paul Karp has been telling you about, on the $4bn education investment fund, is happening. Labor created it when it was in government. The Greens put in a motion to protect it. Labor is voting against the motion. Jacqui Lambie is ESPECIALLY pissed about it. Jacqui Lambie has just got stuck into the deal struck between the Coalition and Labor \u2013 describing it as \u201cpretty pathetic\u201d that Labor has agreed to abolish a $4bn education investment fund in return for $50m for Tafe. \u201cI can get more out of the government with just one of me, than all of you put together,\u201d Lambie said. The Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi says the $50m is \u201cmeasly\u201d and criticises Labor, which she said \u201cused to be the party of public education\u201d. Mathias Cormann has moved the bill out of the committee phase and is now setting a limit on the time for debate \u2013 so we\u2019re going to have a final vote by 11.45. Is there anyone in this building not having a tantrum right now? If so, feel free to swing by the Guardian office for a chocolate. Because this whole place is one giant sulk right now, on all sides. Like I said, totally and absolutely, fine. Everything is fine. The Labor senator Murray Watt has revealed that the opposition has done a deal with the government to pass the emergency response fund bill, which abolishes the education investment fund and redirects it to \u201cfuture emergency response and natural disaster recovery\u201d. The bill is now being debated in the Senate \u2013 where the Greens attempted to stop its progress with amendments saving the education investment fund, and Jacqui Lambie has an amendment that limits the amount that can be taken to three-quarters of the education investment fund. Watt has moved opposition amendments that reflect the deal \u2013 to increase the quantum of the emergency response fund and lift the amount it can pay out each year from $150m to $200m, with the extra $50m to be spent on \u201cdisaster preparedness and mitigation infrastructure\u201d. The government leader in the Senate, Mathias Cormann, thanked the opposition for their \u201cconstructive engagement\u201d on the bill, indicating that the government will support the opposition amendments. Cormann explains that an extra $50m will be given \u201cto establish a $100m Tafe revitalisation grants program in partnership with the states\u201d, with 50/50 funding from the states. It seems the same $50m is being characterised as about disaster mitigation infrastructure and upgrading Tafes! But \u2013 in any event \u2013 a deal has been done so we expect the bill to pass this morning. It\u2019s safe to say not all members of Labor\u2019s movement are happy with the party\u2019s decision to support the Indonesian free trade agreement. Joel Fitzgibbon also notes that while the FHA changes are being put into the parliament today, the Senate doesn\u2019t sit again until November. He says the lump sum payments are not enough and the government\u2019s response has not been enough. It is putting its budget surplus in front of the livelihoods of Australian farmers. Joel Fitzgibbon continues: Labor will use ... every mechanism available to it to try to prevent the government from taking people of the modest Farm Household Allowance and obviously they could be constitutional restrictions on what we can do in the parliament because it is effectively a money bill, proposition to spend more money, but I will make this point about that, while we may be barred from making amendments which have fiscal implications, restoring the payment for these families until this drought breaks, and we all pray outcomes in the not too distant future, is a modest amount of money, a very modest amount of money, in proportion to the total commonwealth budget. And if the prime minister wants to maintain this fiction, so loose with the truth is he, that he is spending $7bn on drought, then people everywhere will be asking well, why prime minister do you find it necessary to cut, cut these farming families\u2019s of this modest payment. Joel Fitzgibbon: The time for in action and talking is behind us. It is time now to act in a meaningful way and I make the appeal to the prime minister again. Establish a bipartisan rural cabinet, drought cabinet, drought advisory committee \u2013 whatever he wants to call it \u2013 because the opposition understands the seriousness of the situation the country now faces. This really is approaching a wartime-like situation. And we stand ready to work with him to make the decisions that will be necessary to ensure another farming families can stay on the land, that rural communities can survive, and we can secure our food sources in this country without becoming too dependent on the importation of our food and fibre. Joel Fitzgibbon says the government\u2019s response to the farm household allowance was \u201cnot good enough\u201d, describing it as \u201cmodest\u201d and \u201cinadequate\u201d. Dipping into state politics for a moment, because of the review Anthony Albanese has ordered into NSW Labor: Earlier today, Kaila Murnain tendered her resignation as General Secretary of the NSW Labor Party. The terms of the separation agreement are confidential, but consist of Ms Murnain\u2019s basic legal entitlements. The full terms of the settlement will be reported to the next meeting of the Administrative Committee. The Party is actively considering seeking the recovery of all of its costs related to the Inquiry, including the sum payable to Ms Murnain, under its insurance policies and from its previous lawyers. A new branch secretary will not be elected until the review into the branch currently being conducted by Professor Michael Lavarch has provided its recommendations on the role of the General Secretary. Joel Fitzgibbon will hold a press conference at 10.45 today to give Labor\u2019s response to the government\u2019s latest drought announcement. Speaking of Ed Husic, you might remember that yesterday\u2019s blog included a speech he made to the federation chamber about the rise of rightwing extremism \u2013 which is exactly what Asio warned about in its public annual report, released late yesterday. Ed Husic, talking to Sky, says there is \u201cvery little modelling\u201d done on the trade agreements but Labor will \u201csupport them, because it is the right thing to do\u201d. He says Labor wants to keep a close eye on \u201cwhat they do to jobs\u201d but that the agreements open up markets in way they haven\u2019t been previously. Today\u2019s announcement also might help explain why Josh Frydenberg yesterday called the drought the \u201cbiggest call on the budget\u201d. Obviously, as the treasurer, he knew this was coming. From a money point of view, it\u2019s still not \u2013 but it is certainly the reason he has had to rework quite a few figures lately. Bridget McKenzie gets to put the release out on it: Today the Australian Government introduced improvements to the Farm Household Allowance (FHA) that will help more farmers through periods of hardship. This is our next step in responding to the Independent Review of FHA which will see more than 30,000 farmers able to access this immediate support. Minister for Agriculture, Senator Bridget McKenzie said the changes extended farming families\u2019 access the FHA from three years in their lifetime to four years out of every 10, recognising that farmers experience hardships, including droughts, more than once in their lives. \u201c...A one-off drought relief payment of up to $13,000 for a farming family, and up to $7,500 for an individual is designed to help people determine whether they will be sustainable, should look at succession options or, in some instances choose to sell. \u201cFor the first time, we\u2019ll link farm enterprises with their directly-related businesses and consider income and losses together \u2013 not just income \u2013 a big change in how Government support payments are provided to families. \u201cOur Government had already made changes to make the FHA quicker and easier to access by reducing paperwork by a third and by temporarily increasing farm assets threshold to $5 million from 1 July 2019. \u201cIt is all part of the radical simplification of the FHA application process and key policy settings that the Prime Minister announced on 27 September.\u201d These improvements include: a simplified assets test a significant redesign of the application process and form, including allowing farming couples to apply using the same form a strengthened case management approach to better support farmers in hardship through periods of financial difficulty. ...The FHA has been supporting Australian farmers since July 2014. It has paid more than $365 million to around 12,700 recipients in that time. David Littleproud, who had some interesting things to say about \u201cmetropolitan commentators\u201d who were \u201cfrothing at the mouth\u201d this morning *cough*, is now introducing those FHA changes in the chamber. Scott Morrison has announced changes to the farm household allowance \u2013 on the John Laws Sydney radio 2SM (who is not Alan Jones, you might note) show. At the end of the four years (the current time allowed for the payment, which essentially is welfare for farmers, and is paid at the same rate as Newstart) farmers will receive a lump sum payment of $7,500 for singles, and $13,000 for couples. Peter Dutton is speaking to the media and he says he feels there may be \u201csome complacency\u201d around security, because \u201cthank God\u201d, Australia has not been the scene of a major terrorist attack within its borders. He\u2019s addressing Duncan Lewis\u2019s parting call \u2013 to publicly request more money for Asio, noting that the resources were strained in the *public* report, as well as warning of a growing rightwing terrorism threat. Dutton blamed Labor for cutting Asio\u2019s budget (Labor has not been in power since 2013) and said the government had been putting that money back. The prime minister is talking to John Laws on 2SM, but none of us can listen in, because the 2SM site is down. AAP on the NDIS announcement: The next boss of the agency responsible for the National Disability Insurance Scheme is a former senior NSW bureaucrat. Martin Hoffman, who has been both a commonwealth deputy secretary and secretary of the NSW Department of Finance, Services and Innovation, will take up the job from November 4. He has also held roles in the private sector, including as chief executive of Ninemsn. NDIS Minister Stuart Robert said Mr Hoffman has the \u201cdedication, vision and expertise\u201d to lead delivery of the transformational scheme. \u201cHe will build on the ground-breaking work already underway and will make a real difference in delivering on the government\u2019s commitment to realising the full benefits of the scheme for participants,\u201d the minister said. Labor had this week put pressure on the coalition to appoint a new leader for the National Disability Insurance Agency, with its previous chief executive Robert De Luca resigning in April. \u201cIt is literally leaderless,\u201d opposition NDIS spokesman Bill Shorten told the lower house on Monday night. The organisation\u2019s deputy chief executive Vicki Rundle had been acting in the top job since Mr De Luca\u2019s resignation. Mr Hoffman has been appointed for a three-year term. Labor has voted to support the Indonesian free trade agreement, at the end of its shadow caucus meeting. Jim Chalmers was asked about Josh Frydenberg\u2019s interview on his way into parliament his morning: The weakness in the Australian economy isn\u2019t primarily because of weakness in the global economy, it\u2019s primarily because the Morrison government doesn\u2019t have a plan. Too many Australians are looking for work or for more work because the economy is floundering on the Liberals\u2019 watch. Business knows, and the community knows, that we won\u2019t get the economic growth we need to create good jobs while the government continues to sit on its hands. The call to parliament has sounded. Huzzah. Stuart Robert has called a doorstop to discuss this at 9.45. Asked for some of those specifics, Fiona Simson told the ABC it was about planning for the future, while looking at ways farmers could diversify their businesses: So, certainly, I think it\u2019s about looking at how we farm now in Australia. How sustainable that is. It\u2019s about looking at add to those income streams. It\u2019s about supporting. We\u2019re looking at, for example, at the moment we can create perhaps energy, we can create income streams from energy on underground gas \u2026 We know that there\u2019s, you know, for example, solar energy can save farmers enormous amounts of money. It\u2019s about looking at planning for drought on a regular basis. [It\u2019s about] how can we make sure that farmers have access to, to to infrastructure on farms, and there\u2019s a whole suite of measures that we want to discuss with the government, but it\u2019s not just about farmers. It is also about rural regional communities. Because if we\u2019re going to relieve the population pressures in the city, if we\u2019re going to really truly build our regional communities at the moment \u2013 we\u2019re talking about indoor agriculture, for example, with vertical farming \u2026 There\u2019s many things we need to look at, Hamish, and that they need to be done together collaboratively, not in this sort of one government at a time, with the industry out of the room and communities out of the room. We need to plan for it. Fiona Simson, the president of the National Farmers\u2019 Federation, also had a chat to ABC radio this morning. Here is some of what she had to say about the drought policy: [Policies] are being developed in a vacuum because there\u2019s no real effective way of measuring whether or not these these measures have been robust. When we get to the end of a drought, and we\u2019ve done it before, we\u2019ve done it recently in the millennial drought, then we just sort of seemed to go that one\u2019s over, pick up our pieces and and wait for the next rather than thinking every day \u2013 how can we make a rural and regional communities more resilient? How can we make our farmers, our really important food- and fibre-growing people, more resilient? How can we keep jobs in the in the country areas? How can we make sure that people have access to fresh water, which is just a first world sort of thing? And these are things that our strategy, which involves all levels of government, working together hand in hand on a regular basis with the community, with farmers, to actually get, you know, put in a new way, a new paradigm of dealing with drought in Australia \u2026 I\u2019ll just finish the that no other government has been able to do this yet. It is an incredibly difficult space to work in. And look, we are really grateful for the Morrison government\u2019s commitment to look at this and to work with us in developing this new strategy. And this new way of treating drought in Australia. There has also been a bit of chatter this morning about Josh Frydenberg\u2019s interview with Phil Coorey in the Fin, in the lead-up to his attendance at the IMF meeting in Washington. It\u2019s an extension of what he was saying yesterday, in response to calls for stimulus after the IMF\u2019s downgrade of Australia\u2019s economic growth outlook. The promised surplus is now being billed as an \u201ceconomic buffer\u201d. \u201cA strong budget position helps build the resilience of the economy for external shocks, whenever that may occur, and your ability to respond to those shocks with a fiscal response,\u201d Frydenberg told the Australian Financial Review. I am not sure that is going to calm the calls for stimulus, given the economy\u2019s position, but you can start to see the narrative they are building \u2013 stimulus is coming, but it will be after the surplus, and what the government considers \u201cgood\u201d stimulus (\u201cbad\u201d stimulus, in this scenario being painted, was Labor\u2019s response after the GFC). The attorney general, Christian Porter, will introduce amendments to native title today. From his release: The native title legislation amendment bill 2019 implements a range of measures recommended by the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) and the Council of Australian Governments (Coag). It was also informed by extensive consultation with native title claimants who said they wanted more flexibility and efficiency built into the system. The bill will provide claimant groups with: \uf0b7 Improved pathways for dispute resolution following a determination of native title; \uf0b7 Increased transparency and accountability for prescribed bodies corporate (the corporations set up to manage native title); \uf0b7 Greater flexibility for bodies corporate to set their own internal processes. Importantly, the bill also seeks to end the uncertainty created by a 2017 full federal court judgment that cast doubts over the validity of hundreds of what are known as \u201csection 31\u201d agreements, which are negotiated between claimant groups and industry to facilitate land access. The McGlade decision found that such agreements were only valid if they were signed by all representatives of a claimant group, rather than by a majority \u2013 even if the only reason for not obtaining every signature was because a single representative had died. The bill will validate all affected agreements and ensure that a majority of representatives can negotiate on behalf of a claimant group in the future. For some history on this issue, you can head here. I told you drought was going to be the issue of the day. I\u2019m listening to Hamish Macdonald interview David Littleproud on RN, and it sounded as though Littleproud just took a swipe at some city media types, saying that \u201cwhile I get a lot of metropolitan commentators are frothing at the mouth at the moment\u201d in regards to the drought and what needs to be done, says we \u201cneed to be careful\u201d not to scare the next generation from entering agriculture as a career. Macdonald pulled him up on the \u201cmetropolitan commentators ... frothing at the mouth\u201d comment. HM: To be perfectly fair, having spent a fair amount of time in drought-affected regions recently, I mean, that is what you hear when you go there \u2013 I mean, I don\u2019t think it is just metropolitan commentators saying this sort of stuff [that more needs to be done], people on farms are quite desperate at the moment; are you sort of diminishing their plight by suggesting that? DL: Totally not, Hamish. I don\u2019t have the comfort of tucking myself into a bed in a metropolitan [area], I actually live and breath it every day, my friend. I actually see these people and I know them by face and by name. These are resilient people. And they believe in what they do and they know what they are doing is the best in the world. Now we are going through a tough time and we\u2019ve continued to have these conditions over our whole agricultural history, but we\u2019ve faced up to them, and we\u2019ve continued to work through them. So we will get through this, and when people say they want hope, then it is about leadership of hope and saying we will get through this, your government will stand shoulder to shoulder with you in this, and we will get you through, in the here and now ... the community and the future, that is why we are going to prepare to get them through this one and prepare them to get through the next one. While it is not unusual for National MPs to talk down about metro journalists with the \u201clatte sippers\u201d line alive and well in Michael McCormack\u2019s world, Littleproud\u2019s comment is interesting given its timing. The conservative Sydney 2GB radio host Alan Jones had quite the combative interview with Scott Morrison on Monday on the issue of the drought, loudly interrupting with \u201chow is that going to feed cows?\u201d as Morrison detailed his government\u2019s spending, and then, when talking about the drought on his Sky News show the next night, broke down crying. I\u2019m not sure if that counts as \u201cfrothing at the mouth\u201d but I\u2019m also pretty sure there will be some raised eyebrows when the comment gets back to some of those metropolitan offices. Meanwhile, Paul Karp had this story late yesterday, after taking a look through the Asio annual report: The threat from extreme rightwing terrorism in Australia has increased in recent years and will remain an \u201cenduring threat\u201d, according to Australia\u2019s spy agency. The Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation issued the warning in its latest annual report, adding that \u201cextreme rightwing groups in Australia are more cohesive and organised than they have been in previous years\u201d. The comments amp up the agency\u2019s concern about rightwing extremist terrorism, after Asio boss Duncan Lewis told Senate estimates in April it was an important issue but the Christchurch massacre had not changed the agency\u2019s calculus. Asio has also reported a strain on its resources, with more calls for advice. Kristina Keneally told the ABC the security agency had sounded an \u201calarm bell\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly important agency in our national security framework and for them to be reporting in this time when the challenges they face are quite complex, that they are stretched for resources, well that\u2019s an alarm bell,\u201d she said. Labor MPs have been called to a special meeting of caucus at 8.30am this morning to decide their position on three new free trade agreements. The meeting comes after a working group of shadow ministers and union leaders held meetings on Wednesday afternoon to try to work through concerns over the Indonesian FTA. Labor is expected to endorse the enabling legislation but a number of MPs from both the left and right factions will push for the party to demand concessions on labor market access and skills testing. It\u2019s expected to spark a heated debate in caucus, particularly given that elements of the agreements are at odds with the party\u2019s national platform. The ACTU has been spearheading lobbying efforts to get the deals knocked off, raising fears about future market access for temporary visa holders under the Indonesian deal. The shadow trade minister, Madeleine King, has been clear that she wants the party to support the agreements but may be forced to adopt a new negotiating position to appease the concerns of caucus. We will know more later this morning. Welcome to the last sitting day for this week. After the parliament rises today, senators will turn their attention to Senate estimates next week, while the House will sit alone. But the ongoing drought looms large over everything being done in this building at the moment, with the government repeatedly forced to defend their strategy. Yesterday, on Sky, Labor\u2019s Joel Fitzgibbon called for a drought \u201cwar cabinet\u201d. The government says it is working with everyone it can to deliver its policy. The National Farmers\u2019 Federation released its own drought plan late yesterday, after repeated calls to plan for the future. From Sarah Martin: Under the policy, the NFF framework proposes that industry, community groups and the three tiers of government all work together in developing a drought strategy. This would identify specific drought measures that need to be maintained, amended or reviewed; and to propose new drought measures, build on the Coag national drought agreement and incorporate lessons learned from past droughts, create a drought forum and establish a drought committee. \u201cWhile this national drought policy comes too late to help those managing this drought, the NFF is determined to see that we don\u2019t find ourselves, once again, without a plan for drought,\u201d the NFF\u2019s Fiona Simson said. \u201cWe continue to consult with the government about further measures to assist farmers during this drought, including recommendations for commonwealth support for local government rate relief.\u201d David Littleproud, speaking to the ABC this morning, says the government \u201calready has\u201d a drought strategy. \u201cOur response has been one of being responsive to the situation,\u201d he said. This is not an issue that is going anywhere. And it is only going to get bigger, with no rains in sight. We\u2019ll bring you that, as well everything else that happens today. Mike Bowers is, as always, up and about, cameras in hand, while Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin and Paul Karp will also be burrowing away on stories. You\u2019ll catch me on the socials, and, when I get a chance, in the comments. And of course, the coffee line. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.",

The project led her to the lively but haunting rebuilt Hiroshima \u2013 missing an essential element \u201clike salt with your victuals, or eyes in a beautiful face\u201d \u2013 and to London, where \u201cthrough the dingy and the disagreeable, the fantastic habitually looms.\u201d Hong Kong she found \u201cindefensible, militarily and economically, and it lives half on trust and half on cynicism,\u201d while of her beloved Venice, which since the turn of the 19th century \u201chas chiefly existed to be stared at\u201d, she declared: \u201cLet her sink.\u201d</p> <p>City criticism is not travel writing, but it should take Morris\u2019 work as a model of how to let readers see a city through the writer\u2019s eyes. It should also pry loose the clich\u00e9s that inevitably adhere to a place, as when Morris came to Los Angeles, eschewed references to stardom and sprawl, and described the city as where \u201cthe lost American faith in machines and materialism built its own astonishing monument.\u201d</p> <p>Sometimes city criticism has tangible effects. Nearly 60 years after its publication, The Death and Life of Great American Cities continues to open readers\u2019 eyes to the unplanned \u201cballet of the good city sidewalk\u201d that Jacobs observed in her native New York City: in the students, shop owners, commuters and delivery people, \u201cthe individual dancers and ensembles all have distinctive parts which miraculously reinforce each other and compose an orderly whole\u201d.</p> <p>But Jacobs also raised the alarm about the threatened eradication of that finely grained street life by New York\u2019s so-called master builder of freeways and high-rises, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/sep/12/jane-jacobs-new-york-history\">urban planner Robert Moses</a>. Later in the decade, she got involved in the struggle against Moses, repeatedly protesting against his plan to run the Lower Manhattan Expressway through her neighbourhood of Greenwich Village. After fighting the project to its death she moved to Toronto, a city that provided more subjects for her criticism and more development projects \u2013 a new freeway, a waterfront bridge \u2013 to publicly oppose.</p> <p>Some city critics will follow Jacobs\u2019 example and seek to influence the shape of cities, while others will seek only to understand it. The architects Robert Venturi, Denise Scott Brown and Steven Izenour exemplify that method in 1972\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/feb/09/las-vegas-strip-learning-temple-excess\">Learning from Las Vegas</a>, a subject they felt obliged to justify: \u201cWe look backward at history and tradition to go forward; we can also look downward to go upward,\u201d they write. \u201cWithholding judgment may be used as a tool to make later judgment more sensitive. This is a way of learning from everything.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e60626eb8d59e9932ab384aa23ceeef0839807b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e60626eb8d59e9932ab384aa23ceeef0839807b0/0_0_3278_3390/967.jpg\" alt=\"Jane Jacobs and architect Philip Johnson, right, stand with picketing crowds outside Penn Station to protest the building\u2019s demolition.\" width=\"967\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jane Jacobs and architect Philip Johnson, right, stand with picketing crowds outside Penn Station to protest the building\u2019s demolition.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Walter Daran/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Indeed, city critics should write about everything: their subject is a nexus of subjects. Ada Louise Huxtable concerned herself with not just her official beat of architecture at the New York Times and later the Wall Street Journal, but also development economics and the policy of land use and transportation; the ultra-opinionated Ian Nairn savaged postwar Britain\u2019s uninspired buildings and even less inspired city planning; the New Yorker\u2019s architecture critic Mumford wrote about highways, housing and planning, but also literature, technology and politics. And longtime writer on the built environment Karrie Jacobs points out that most writers on cities currently \u201ceither focus on urban problems or urban pleasures,\u201d whereas \u201cin truth, the problems and the pleasures have a symbiotic relationship,\u201d which any critic worthy of the title understands.</p> <p>What would a more fully developed city criticism have to offer? Most who write about cities agree on one thing: helping effect change. The British writer Owen Hatherley, a sometime Guardian Cities contributor who has looked often at post-Soviet urban landscapes, argues for city criticism to \u201chelp us understand cities, and how they have been shaped by very particular decisions, choices and interests, and that they can be changed, influenced and transformed in turn.\u201d Nikil Saval, the Indian-American writer, puts capitalism in his crosshairs, since \u201cyou can often see examples of our economic system\u2019s mutations and depredations in how cities and city politics work\u201d. Spacing magazine\u2019s Shawn Micallef sees his mission \u201cto get people to really see, experience and live their city,\u201d since they \u201cwon\u2019t fight for something to be better if they haven\u2019t yet fallen in love with it.\u201d Walker underscores the importance of advocating for \u201cthe people who keep the city running.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/may/04/jane-jacobs-100th-birthday-saskia-sassen\">How Jane Jacobs changed the way we look at cities | Saskia Sassen</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But city critics should be be writers above all else. And though the past decade has seen an abundance of city-related content in print and online, cities need writers more than ever. That is, cities need to be written about well and in a way that lasts, not merely to spot trends, air grievances, or enter technocratic squabbles. Readers will only tolerate so much more one-dimensional discussion before developing city fatigue, and history has shown what happens to cities when the public loses interest in them. Hence the city critic\u2019s mandate to keep readers engaged and thinking in the long term by treating the city as not just as a fashionable place to live and work, nor as an ideological, economic, and social battleground, but as one of the very richest, most stimulating subjects available.</p> <p>Unlike service journalism, city criticism must remain fresh while the city changes over time; unlike academic theory, it must be written for the general public; unlike activism, it must keep the distance necessary for keen, aesthetically sensitive observation. City critics must be invested in not just buildings, infrastructure, and public space, but in words, sentences, and the play of ideas. Only then can they write like EB White did on New York\u2019s paradoxical generosity of privacy:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is this largesse that accounts for the presence within the city\u2019s walls of a considerable section of the population; for the residents of Manhattan are to a large extent strangers who have pulled up stakes somewhere and come to town, seeking sanctuary or fulfilment or some greater or lesser grail. The capacity to make such dubious gifs is a mysterious quality of New York. It can destroy an individual, or it can fulfil him, depending a good deal on luck.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Despite having been written 70 years ago, the observation holds up today \u2013 though city critics to come, taking a page from each of these writers and others besides, should feel free to argue otherwise.</p> <p><em>Follow Guardian Cities on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardiancities\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiancities\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardiancities/?hl=en\">Instagram</a> to join the discussion, catch up on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities\">our best stories</a> or sign up for our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/may/03/sign-up-for-the-cityscape-the-best-of-guardian-cities-every-week\">weekly newsletter</a></em><br></p>",

But Jacobs also raised the alarm about the threatened eradication of that finely grained street life by New York\u2019s so-called master builder of freeways and high-rises, the urban planner Robert Moses. Later in the decade, she got involved in the struggle against Moses, repeatedly protesting against his plan to run the Lower Manhattan Expressway through her neighbourhood of Greenwich Village. After fighting the project to its death she moved to Toronto, a city that provided more subjects for her criticism and more development projects \u2013 a new freeway, a waterfront bridge \u2013 to publicly oppose. Some city critics will follow Jacobs\u2019 example and seek to influence the shape of cities, while others will seek only to understand it. The architects Robert Venturi, Denise Scott Brown and Steven Izenour exemplify that method in 1972\u2019s Learning from Las Vegas, a subject they felt obliged to justify: \u201cWe look backward at history and tradition to go forward; we can also look downward to go upward,\u201d they write. \u201cWithholding judgment may be used as a tool to make later judgment more sensitive. This is a way of learning from everything.\u201d Indeed, city critics should write about everything: their subject is a nexus of subjects. Ada Louise Huxtable concerned herself with not just her official beat of architecture at the New York Times and later the Wall Street Journal, but also development economics and the policy of land use and transportation; the ultra-opinionated Ian Nairn savaged postwar Britain\u2019s uninspired buildings and even less inspired city planning; the New Yorker\u2019s architecture critic Mumford wrote about highways, housing and planning, but also literature, technology and politics. And longtime writer on the built environment Karrie Jacobs points out that most writers on cities currently \u201ceither focus on urban problems or urban pleasures,\u201d whereas \u201cin truth, the problems and the pleasures have a symbiotic relationship,\u201d which any critic worthy of the title understands. What would a more fully developed city criticism have to offer? Most who write about cities agree on one thing: helping effect change. The British writer Owen Hatherley, a sometime Guardian Cities contributor who has looked often at post-Soviet urban landscapes, argues for city criticism to \u201chelp us understand cities, and how they have been shaped by very particular decisions, choices and interests, and that they can be changed, influenced and transformed in turn.\u201d Nikil Saval, the Indian-American writer, puts capitalism in his crosshairs, since \u201cyou can often see examples of our economic system\u2019s mutations and depredations in how cities and city politics work\u201d. Spacing magazine\u2019s Shawn Micallef sees his mission \u201cto get people to really see, experience and live their city,\u201d since they \u201cwon\u2019t fight for something to be better if they haven\u2019t yet fallen in love with it.\u201d Walker underscores the importance of advocating for \u201cthe people who keep the city running.\u201d But city critics should be be writers above all else. And though the past decade has seen an abundance of city-related content in print and online, cities need writers more than ever. That is, cities need to be written about well and in a way that lasts, not merely to spot trends, air grievances, or enter technocratic squabbles. Readers will only tolerate so much more one-dimensional discussion before developing city fatigue, and history has shown what happens to cities when the public loses interest in them. Hence the city critic\u2019s mandate to keep readers engaged and thinking in the long term by treating the city as not just as a fashionable place to live and work, nor as an ideological, economic, and social battleground, but as one of the very richest, most stimulating subjects available. Unlike service journalism, city criticism must remain fresh while the city changes over time; unlike academic theory, it must be written for the general public; unlike activism, it must keep the distance necessary for keen, aesthetically sensitive observation. City critics must be invested in not just buildings, infrastructure, and public space, but in words, sentences, and the play of ideas. Only then can they write like EB White did on New York\u2019s paradoxical generosity of privacy: It is this largesse that accounts for the presence within the city\u2019s walls of a considerable section of the population; for the residents of Manhattan are to a large extent strangers who have pulled up stakes somewhere and come to town, seeking sanctuary or fulfilment or some greater or lesser grail. The capacity to make such dubious gifs is a mysterious quality of New York. It can destroy an individual, or it can fulfil him, depending a good deal on luck.\u201d Despite having been written 70 years ago, the observation holds up today \u2013 though city critics to come, taking a page from each of these writers and others besides, should feel free to argue otherwise.

Charlottesville hadn\u2019t happened,\u201d Cooley recalls. \u201cNobody in 2016 was talking about Facebook ad-buys or little videos. And it worked. People ran campaigns it didn\u2019t have any tinge of negativity.</p> <p>\u201cWe designed it for pure citizen engagement, a well-moderated town hall for civic action and trying to leverage ideas where trust and good faith ruled \u2013 not a place for food fights,\u201d Cooley says. \u201cAll that kicked off when Trump won.\u201d</p> <p>But it was money that undid democracy.com, or rather the lack of it.</p> <p>Democracy.com ran into problems after merchandising and credit-card fees failed to produce enough revenue. A shift to a subscription model proved to be too expensive. For five years the site was funded by angel investors. In February funding dried up, and the site shuttered two months later.</p> <p>Cooley said he was \u201cbroken-hearted\u201d when the decision came to put the business up for sale. He estimates it would cost $2m to recode the site into a subscription-based model \u2013 a change, he says, the site\u2019s users indicate they\u2019d accept.</p> <p>Over the past months he has been doing the calculations. There are 2,500 billionaires on the planet, 20,000 people worth $400m or more. \u201cWe just need to find one that is passionate enough about democracy to say, \u2018Hey, I bought a $10m house in the South of France, for $10m I could certainly buy democracy.com.\u2019 \u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think the buyer is a high net worth individual or organization in a country where issues of democracy are important and active,\u201d Cooley said, noting that the site registered traffic from India when news of the auction was first publicized. \u201cMaybe somebody who wants to do good and have some status to go along with it.\u201d</p> <p>Cooley has tried reaching out to the obvious candidates \u2013 the LinkedIn billionaire Reed Hoffman, New York\u2019s former mayor Mike Bloomberg, Republican senator Mitt Romney and Tom Steyer, the billionaire and would-be Democratic presidential candidate. But he concedes it\u2019s hard to get close to the decision-makers. As a veteran activist he says he\u2019s learned something else: \u201cThese rich guys are only interested in doing something they can put their name on.\u201d</p>",

It\u2019s a gamble, like democracy itself, and it\u2019s possible that there will be no buyers at all. \u201cThis is an aspirational piece of real estate that represents one of the core values on the planet, and it\u2019s worth what somebody thinks they can do to leverage that name,\u201d Cooley told the Guardian. Domain names are not what they used to be and values have fallen since domain suffixes were expanded beyond dot com and dot org. The highest recorded price for a domain was cars.com, valued at $872m in 2015. But .com domains attached to prestige words are still going for big sums. In June, Voice.com sold for $30m. Elliot Silver of DomainInvesting.com called the Voice.com purchase \u201ceasily the largest domain name sale of the year and one of the largest pure domain name sales of all time\u201d. According to the domain brokerage GoDaddy, the five most expensive publicly reported domain names are CarInsurance.com \u2013 $49.7m; Insurance.com \u2013 $35.6m; VacationRentals.com \u2013 $35m; PrivateJet.com \u2013 $30.18m; and Voice.com \u2013 $30m. Sex.com sold for $14m and Porno.com \u2013 $8.8m. On 24 October, Fashion.com goes up for sale in a sealed bid auction. The sellers offer no guidelines to the asking price. Cooley, who holds a master\u2019s in civic engagement and technology from Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School, is a stakeholder but not the owner of the site, whom he declined to name. He established it in 2013 as an altruistic, for-profit business to democratize access to political communication and counter the role of money in politics. \u201cThe idea was to make it easy for anyone who wants to run for office to start a political or civic group, for a citizen to find the positions and voting record of candidate,\u201d Cooley told the Guardian. Set up before the Trump election and before anyone had heard of Cambridge Analytica, the site was a safe space for political discourse. \u201cWhen we set up democracy.com it was pre-Trump, pre-nationalism and neo-fascism. Charlottesville hadn\u2019t happened,\u201d Cooley recalls. \u201cNobody in 2016 was talking about Facebook ad-buys or little videos. And it worked. People ran campaigns it didn\u2019t have any tinge of negativity. \u201cWe designed it for pure citizen engagement, a well-moderated town hall for civic action and trying to leverage ideas where trust and good faith ruled \u2013 not a place for food fights,\u201d Cooley says. \u201cAll that kicked off when Trump won.\u201d But it was money that undid democracy.com, or rather the lack of it. Democracy.com ran into problems after merchandising and credit-card fees failed to produce enough revenue. A shift to a subscription model proved to be too expensive. For five years the site was funded by angel investors. In February funding dried up, and the site shuttered two months later. Cooley said he was \u201cbroken-hearted\u201d when the decision came to put the business up for sale. He estimates it would cost $2m to recode the site into a subscription-based model \u2013 a change, he says, the site\u2019s users indicate they\u2019d accept. Over the past months he has been doing the calculations. There are 2,500 billionaires on the planet, 20,000 people worth $400m or more. \u201cWe just need to find one that is passionate enough about democracy to say, \u2018Hey, I bought a $10m house in the South of France, for $10m I could certainly buy democracy.com.\u2019 \u201d \u201cI think the buyer is a high net worth individual or organization in a country where issues of democracy are important and active,\u201d Cooley said, noting that the site registered traffic from India when news of the auction was first publicized. \u201cMaybe somebody who wants to do good and have some status to go along with it.\u201d Cooley has tried reaching out to the obvious candidates \u2013 the LinkedIn billionaire Reed Hoffman, New York\u2019s former mayor Mike Bloomberg, Republican senator Mitt Romney and Tom Steyer, the billionaire and would-be Democratic presidential candidate. But he concedes it\u2019s hard to get close to the decision-makers. As a veteran activist he says he\u2019s learned something else: \u201cThese rich guys are only interested in doing something they can put their name on.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Rightwing activists are attempting to spread new laws across Republican-controlled states that would ban criticism on public university campuses of Israel and its occupation of Palestinian territory. Pro-Israel and conservative lobbyists are encouraging state lawmakers to outlaw antisemitism in public education, from kindergarten through to graduate universities. But the proposed definition of antisemitism is so wide that, in addition to standard protections against hate speech towards Jews, it would also prohibit debate about the human rights violations of the Israeli government. First amendment advocates see the potential spread of such laws as a major threat to free speech on campuses. Among the activities that would be prohibited by the new laws are human rights investigations focusing specifically on Israel. Also banned would be any speech \u201cdemonizing Israel by \u2026 blaming Israel for all inter-religious or political tensions\u201d or \u201cdelegitimizing Israel by \u2026 questioning Israel\u2019s right to exist\u201d. The push began at a conference in August held by the American Legislative Exchange Council, Alec, a conservative network which has a long history of propagating rightwing policies at state level through model bills. The group, dubbed a \u201cbill mill\u201d, has spearheaded attacks on trade unions, opposition to Obamacare, voter suppression measures and legislation blocking efforts to address the climate crisis.

      "body": "<p>Looks like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is a \u201cBernie Bro\u201d now. After months of speculation about whether the progressive congresswoman would endorse Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren for president, she is set to throw her weight behind Sanders at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/15/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-bernie-sanders-endorsement\">a campaign rally on Saturday</a>.</p> <p>AOC isn\u2019t the only member of the Squad who is Team Bernie. Ilhan Omar <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IlhanMN/status/1184437891197472769?s=20\">endorsed the Vermont senator for president on Wednesday morning</a>, with a video explaining that she is \u201cone of the people that was inspired by the movement that the senator has built\u201d. Rashida Tlaib is also expected to endorse Sanders.</p> <p>The Squad are unashamedly progressive. Sanders is the most progressive candidate. The fact that Ocasio-Cortez, Omar and Tlaib are backing him should come as little surprise. And yet the idea that female politicians would endorse an old white guy instead of Warren, an old white woman, seemed to throw a number of people for a loop.</p> <p>Jane Eisner, for example, director of academic affairs at Columbia Journalism School <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Jane_Eisner/status/1184443496389926914?s=20\">tweeted</a>: \u201cI find it fascinating that women of color overlook female and minority candidates to endorse a white guy. Is \u2018identity politics\u2019 over? Is ideology more important than race and gender? Genuinely curious.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019ll tell you what I find fascinating: the fact that the concept of \u201cidentity politics\u201d has become so thoroughly distorted that people seem to think it means voting for the candidate that looks most like you, or shares your sexual preferences, their policies be damned. The idea that \u201cwomen of colour\u201d would align themselves with a candidate simply because of their sex or skin colour is incredibly condescending. You also can\u2019t ask whether ideology is more important than race and gender, because the three are not separate, stand-alone entities. But as a \u201cwoman of colour\u201d I can tell you right now that ideology is far more important than skin-deep representation.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the thing: if Sanders and Warren were completely interchangeable in their politics then it would make sense to get behind Warren because she is a woman. America is way overdue a female president. But while Warren and Sanders may be far more to the left than the rest of the Democrats, their politics are not identical. Warren has made it clear that she is a capitalist while Sanders describes himself as a democratic socialist. That difference isn\u2019t a small question of semantics \u2013 it\u2019s reflective of a fundamentally different world view.</p> <p>I like Warren, don\u2019t get me wrong. But, for me, one of the most important differences between the two is that Sanders is more progressive when it comes to <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2019/05/elizabeth-warren-foreign-policy\">foreign policy</a>. (And I\u2019d like to remind all the people who seem to think that Warren is far more of a feminist than Sanders that women outside America matter as well.) Warren isn\u2019t a war-mongerer but she seems to be more concerned with ensuring the military is <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/443789-warren-releases-plan-to-tackle-climate-change-threats-to-military\">environmentally</a><a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/443789-warren-releases-plan-to-tackle-climate-change-threats-to-military\"> friendly</a> rather than putting an end to American imperialism. Sanders, on the other hand, has spent his entire life speaking out about the horrors of American foreign policy.

      "bodyText": "Looks like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is a \u201cBernie Bro\u201d now. After months of speculation about whether the progressive congresswoman would endorse Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren for president, she is set to throw her weight behind Sanders at a campaign rally on Saturday. AOC isn\u2019t the only member of the Squad who is Team Bernie. Ilhan Omar endorsed the Vermont senator for president on Wednesday morning, with a video explaining that she is \u201cone of the people that was inspired by the movement that the senator has built\u201d. Rashida Tlaib is also expected to endorse Sanders. The Squad are unashamedly progressive. Sanders is the most progressive candidate. The fact that Ocasio-Cortez, Omar and Tlaib are backing him should come as little surprise. And yet the idea that female politicians would endorse an old white guy instead of Warren, an old white woman, seemed to throw a number of people for a loop. Jane Eisner, for example, director of academic affairs at Columbia Journalism School tweeted: \u201cI find it fascinating that women of color overlook female and minority candidates to endorse a white guy. Is \u2018identity politics\u2019 over? Is ideology more important than race and gender? Genuinely curious.\u201d I\u2019ll tell you what I find fascinating: the fact that the concept of \u201cidentity politics\u201d has become so thoroughly distorted that people seem to think it means voting for the candidate that looks most like you, or shares your sexual preferences, their policies be damned. The idea that \u201cwomen of colour\u201d would align themselves with a candidate simply because of their sex or skin colour is incredibly condescending. You also can\u2019t ask whether ideology is more important than race and gender, because the three are not separate, stand-alone entities. But as a \u201cwoman of colour\u201d I can tell you right now that ideology is far more important than skin-deep representation. Here\u2019s the thing: if Sanders and Warren were completely interchangeable in their politics then it would make sense to get behind Warren because she is a woman. America is way overdue a female president. But while Warren and Sanders may be far more to the left than the rest of the Democrats, their politics are not identical. Warren has made it clear that she is a capitalist while Sanders describes himself as a democratic socialist. That difference isn\u2019t a small question of semantics \u2013 it\u2019s reflective of a fundamentally different world view. I like Warren, don\u2019t get me wrong. But, for me, one of the most important differences between the two is that Sanders is more progressive when it comes to foreign policy. (And I\u2019d like to remind all the people who seem to think that Warren is far more of a feminist than Sanders that women outside America matter as well.) Warren isn\u2019t a war-mongerer but she seems to be more concerned with ensuring the military is environmentally friendly rather than putting an end to American imperialism. Sanders, on the other hand, has spent his entire life speaking out about the horrors of American foreign policy. Which, of course, has done him zero favours politically: nothing makes you more unpopular with the establishment in this country than suggesting that America isn\u2019t always a force for good in the world. That AOC, Omar, and Tlaib are endorsing Sanders rather than Warren makes perfect sense from an ideological point of view. Their worldviews are far more aligned to Sanders than they are Warren\u2019s. The more important question, perhaps, is just how significant this endorsement actually is. There are currently three schools of thought on this: 1 It doesn\u2019t make any difference; 2 It helps Sanders because it makes him seem more relevant; 3 It helps Warren because it makes her seem less radical. My own view is that, in terms of the primary, it makes very little difference. Sanders isn\u2019t going to get the nomination because the Squad endorsed him, nor will it take a significant number of votes from Warren. But this isn\u2019t to say that the endorsement isn\u2019t significant. Having three prominent women of colour vocalize their support for Sanders makes it harder for the media to keep pushing the ridiculous idea that he doesn\u2019t connect with women or people of colour. It makes it harder to erase his female following and pretend that his only fans are irritating Bernie Bros. The Squad\u2019s endorsement is also a reminder that Sanders has done more than any other politician to push America leftwards and make topics like Medicare for All and free education mainstream talking points. As Omar herself said, he has built a movement and inspired a new generation of democratic socialists. There are plenty of people itching for Sanders to drop out of the race and go away, but it\u2019s not going to be that easy to get rid of him, I\u2019m afraid.

It takes on an entirely different dimension when lit up at night, and I\u2019ve seen it used for everything from student celebrations to a shelter for horse-drawn carriages. Public architecture at its best. \u2022 visit.gent.be Joel Serpentine Coffee House, London Small but rather lovely, this new cafe in Hyde Park has a brass roof that\u2019s designed to look like a stingray. The undulating shape creates the impression of a smiling mouth. From a distance, it looks like a Japanese pagoda. Inside, the theme continues: the underside of the roof is ridged to give the impression that you are inside the mouth of a sea creature. If that sounds creepy, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s light and airy and a great place to enjoy coffee, artisan ice cream and other tasty treats. \u2022 Open 8.30 am til dusk, mizzi.co Rod Looking for a holiday with a difference?

This goal is part of a newly unveiled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2019/oct/16/the-guardians-climate-pledge-2019\">environmental pledge</a> to continue our longstanding record of powerful environmental reporting. \u201cWe have always <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/16/today-we-pledge-to-give-the-climate-crisis-the-attention-it-demands\">led the way in environmental reporting</a>,\u201d writes Katharine Viner, the Guardian\u2019s editor-in-chief, \u201cwhether it\u2019s covering air pollution or wildlife extinction, threats to the oceans or the human and social costs that rising temperatures bring.

So I would need to understand what, if you were going to change, that would do to their income.\u201d Her comments will boost the hopes of anti-BBC Tories, and scrapping the licence fee was recently raised by the rightwing Institute for Economic Affairs thinktank. Sources in her department later suggested it would not be a priority for Morgan and pointed out the government has committed to maintain the licence fee funding model for the BBC until 2027.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Banks shamed over Saudi oil float \u2013 </strong>Environmental groups have warned banks linked to Saudi Aramco\u2019s planned market float that they risk financing the destruction of the planet. Saudi Arabia\u2019s state oil company has reportedly hired major banks including JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and HSBC to help arrange its $2tn (\u00a31.6tn) market debut.

Barrister Greg Treverton-Jones, who survived the crash and worked on the subsequent harrowing inquiry, pieced together what went wrong. A warning: this article contains graphic details. Sport Eddie Jones has sprung a huge surprise by dropping George Ford and naming Owen Farrell at fly-half for England\u2019s Rugby World Cup quarter-final against Australia on Saturday. England\u2019s Maro Itoje has slammed this week\u2019s racist abuse in football as appalling and abysmal and warned that rugby union should not consider itself immune from similar problems. Boxer Patrick Day has died after he sustained head injuries in a fight on Saturday night against fellow American Charles Conwell. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r needs more time and respect at Manchester United, writes Rob Smyth, and the choice is simple: potential long-term success under the Norwegian or guaranteed long-term failure under a number of different managers. Professional women\u2019s golf in Europe is set to be afforded a timely boost after talks resumed over the LPGA Tour\u2019s proposed takeover of the Ladies European Tour. Despite a late strike that earned Atl\u00e9tico Madrid a precious away goal, and a draw in the Women\u2019s Champions League, the Manchester City manager, Nick Cushing, remained relaxed. And American golfer Lee Ann Walker was not aware that caddies no longer can stand behind players as they putt unless a player starts the stance over \u2013 and she paid a dear price, adding 58 penalty strokes at a Senior LPGA event. Business Asian stocks have barely moved after soft US retail sales data raised fears about the health of the world\u2019s largest economy, sucking the steam out of a five-session rally. Indices in South Korea, Australia and New Zealand were all in negative territory, Chinese shares were mostly flat, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei ticked up and US stock futures were barely changed. MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was slightly higher with gains largely led by Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng. The pound is worth $1.282 and \u20ac1.157 at the moment while the FTSE is looking flat. The papers We\u2019ve got a full roundup of the front pages here \u2013 a summary follows. A photograph of Boris Johnson walking behind a metal fence, appearing as if he were behind bars, provided a visual metaphor too good for most publications to pass up and it is the lead image on most of the front pages. The Telegraph really pushes the image, its slightly baffling headline is: \u201cBrexit is like the Shawshank Redemption ... but now we can see the light\u201d. The Express has: \u201cAgainst all odds, Boris closes in on Brexit deal\u201d, the Times reports: \u201cBrexit deal on knife edge as DUP blocks Johnson\u201d, the Mail says: \u201cIn sight of the summit\u201d, the Guardian has: \u201cJohnson in last-minute scramble for DUP backing\u201d, the Mirror goes with: \u201cBrexit on a knife-edge\u201d, the i\u2019s splash is: \u201cDeadlock on Brexit deal ahead of summit\u201d. In other news \u2013 the FT reports: \u201cHargreaves Lansdown under fire as Woodford collapse traps clients\u201d and the Sun\u2019s splash is: \u201cEgo warriors\u201d, as it accuses celebrities who support Extinction Rebellion, including Benedict Cumberbatch and Steve Coogan, of having \u201chigh-carbon lifestyles\u201d.

      "body": "<p>The funny thing is that I\u2019d had a virtual punch-up with the Rolling Stones just a few weeks before I did this photoshoot for their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/17/the-rolling-stones-every-album-ranked\">Beggars Banquet album in 1968</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jan/08/milk-marketing-board-dairy-farmers\">Milk Marketing Board</a> had sent me up to Newcastle for a campaign, and the Stones happened to be staying at the same hotel. We\u2019d just been to their concert, and were having a late dinner. They were sitting next to us. Various women were coming up to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/28/jumping-jack-cash-how-young-mick-jagger-planned-pension-rolling-stones\">Mick Jagger</a> and asking for his autograph. So my girlfriend, Julie \u2013 who became my wife of 55 years \u2013 went over, but she didn\u2019t even get a chance to ask, because Mick just waved her away saying: \u201cNo, love, you\u2019re too young.\u201d I had my camera ready, but unfortunately I didn\u2019t take a picture. That would have been fantastic, Mick waving his arms around.</p> <p>The next morning, the band were lounging around in the hotel foyer. To their evident annoyance I got my camera out and was about to snap them, but then their car arrived and they left before they had a chance to say to me: \u201cWho do you think you are?\u201d When I got chosen to do their album cover I was dreading the thought that Mick was going to recognise me, so I had my hair cut much shorter and changed my clothing.</p> <p>I was known for doing group scenes \u2013 a shoot with up to 50 people became known as a \u201cMichael Joseph\u201d in the business \u2013 and my early shot of a boardroom for a White Horse whisky ad in 1965 had been used as a giant poster all over England. That was what got me the Beggars Banquet job. The shoot location was wonderful, up in Sarum Chase, in Hampstead, north London, where Frank O Salisbury, the Victorian society painter, had lived and worked. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Brian Jones was very happy playing with a labrador. Charlie Watts was chatting up the stuffed monkey</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The caretaker there \u2013 a very careful, grey-haired man \u2013 said: \u201cSo this is for the Rolling Stones?\u201d I said: \u201cYes, I\u2019m afraid they\u2019re a bit wild.\u201d He said: \u201cNo, that\u2019s not a problem. But I\u2019m a bit worried. Will there be any naked ladies?\u201d And I said: \u201cNo, it\u2019ll just be the band. Why, what\u2019s the problem with naked ladies?\u201d And he told me: \u201cWell, for naked ladies, we charge \u00a310 extra.\u201d</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/apr/01/derekmalcolmscenturyoffilm.derekmalcolm\">1961 film Viridiana, directed by Luis Bu\u00f1uel</a> \u2013 which has a famous scene of beggars at a banquet \u2013 was probably in the mind of Mike Peters, the art director. There\u2019s meant to be a look of decadence about the photo. That word sums up the era. The swinging 60s was considered a period where people did what they liked.</p> <p>The Stones arrived punctually. They were impressed with my lighting setup, and this fantastic, beautiful room. I was already there, talking through a megaphone to the goats, dogs and all the other animals we had for the shoot, getting them to understand what it was all about. I was good with animals and they behaved very nicely. Most of the feast on the table was prop food, but luckily, I\u2019d put down a bowl of real cherries, and the goat was munching away on those. There were some cats knocking around the set, too, and they didn\u2019t seem to be put off by 20,000 joules of light flashing away.</p> <p>We only had two hours for the whole session, so literally within 10 minutes, the band were all changed. They just put on whatever costume they fancied and we didn\u2019t bother with makeup \u2013 it wasn\u2019t necessary. I put <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/dec/14/keith-richards-gives-up-drinking-almost-saying-i-got-fed-up-with-it\">Keith Richards</a> in the centre of the photo because he was the best-looking and the youngest. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/02/the-quiet-one-review-bill-wyman-documentary\">Bill Wyman</a>, not so good-looking, so we put him further back. On the right, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2014/jul/06/mick-jagger-brian-jones-hyde-park-observer-archive\">Brian Jones</a> was very happy playing with a labrador. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/feb/27/charlie-watts-it-wouldnt-bother-me-if-rolling-stones-split\">Charlie Watts</a> was chatting up the stuffed monkey that\u2019s on the table. Mick was happy to be centre-stage, standing on the table, cuddling some of the animals. There were other shots from this session where he\u2019s holding a baby eagle, but then he got bored with that.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/17/the-rolling-stones-every-album-ranked\">The Rolling Stones \u2013 every album ranked!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Brian had been busted the night before. The police knew the band were smoking drugs, so they\u2019d raided his place, but didn\u2019t find anything. So he wasn\u2019t actually arrested, but he was a bit subdued for the whole shoot. I obviously didn\u2019t bring it up. Presumably, they\u2019d been out drinking all the night before, but none of them even brought a cup of coffee in to the shoot.</p> <p>The band were very well-behaved and it all went like clockwork. My girlfriend was also at the shoot and at the end of the session, Mick came up to me and said: \u201cYou and your bird can come in my limo up to Swarkestone\u201d \u2013 where we were doing more pictures for the album.

      "bodyText": "The funny thing is that I\u2019d had a virtual punch-up with the Rolling Stones just a few weeks before I did this photoshoot for their Beggars Banquet album in 1968. The Milk Marketing Board had sent me up to Newcastle for a campaign, and the Stones happened to be staying at the same hotel. We\u2019d just been to their concert, and were having a late dinner. They were sitting next to us. Various women were coming up to Mick Jagger and asking for his autograph. So my girlfriend, Julie \u2013 who became my wife of 55 years \u2013 went over, but she didn\u2019t even get a chance to ask, because Mick just waved her away saying: \u201cNo, love, you\u2019re too young.\u201d I had my camera ready, but unfortunately I didn\u2019t take a picture. That would have been fantastic, Mick waving his arms around. The next morning, the band were lounging around in the hotel foyer. To their evident annoyance I got my camera out and was about to snap them, but then their car arrived and they left before they had a chance to say to me: \u201cWho do you think you are?\u201d When I got chosen to do their album cover I was dreading the thought that Mick was going to recognise me, so I had my hair cut much shorter and changed my clothing. I was known for doing group scenes \u2013 a shoot with up to 50 people became known as a \u201cMichael Joseph\u201d in the business \u2013 and my early shot of a boardroom for a White Horse whisky ad in 1965 had been used as a giant poster all over England. That was what got me the Beggars Banquet job. The shoot location was wonderful, up in Sarum Chase, in Hampstead, north London, where Frank O Salisbury, the Victorian society painter, had lived and worked. The caretaker there \u2013 a very careful, grey-haired man \u2013 said: \u201cSo this is for the Rolling Stones?\u201d I said: \u201cYes, I\u2019m afraid they\u2019re a bit wild.\u201d He said: \u201cNo, that\u2019s not a problem. But I\u2019m a bit worried. Will there be any naked ladies?\u201d And I said: \u201cNo, it\u2019ll just be the band. Why, what\u2019s the problem with naked ladies?\u201d And he told me: \u201cWell, for naked ladies, we charge \u00a310 extra.\u201d The 1961 film Viridiana, directed by Luis Bu\u00f1uel \u2013 which has a famous scene of beggars at a banquet \u2013 was probably in the mind of Mike Peters, the art director. There\u2019s meant to be a look of decadence about the photo. That word sums up the era. The swinging 60s was considered a period where people did what they liked. The Stones arrived punctually. They were impressed with my lighting setup, and this fantastic, beautiful room. I was already there, talking through a megaphone to the goats, dogs and all the other animals we had for the shoot, getting them to understand what it was all about. I was good with animals and they behaved very nicely. Most of the feast on the table was prop food, but luckily, I\u2019d put down a bowl of real cherries, and the goat was munching away on those. There were some cats knocking around the set, too, and they didn\u2019t seem to be put off by 20,000 joules of light flashing away. We only had two hours for the whole session, so literally within 10 minutes, the band were all changed. They just put on whatever costume they fancied and we didn\u2019t bother with makeup \u2013 it wasn\u2019t necessary. I put Keith Richards in the centre of the photo because he was the best-looking and the youngest. Bill Wyman, not so good-looking, so we put him further back. On the right, Brian Jones was very happy playing with a labrador. Charlie Watts was chatting up the stuffed monkey that\u2019s on the table. Mick was happy to be centre-stage, standing on the table, cuddling some of the animals. There were other shots from this session where he\u2019s holding a baby eagle, but then he got bored with that. Brian had been busted the night before. The police knew the band were smoking drugs, so they\u2019d raided his place, but didn\u2019t find anything. So he wasn\u2019t actually arrested, but he was a bit subdued for the whole shoot. I obviously didn\u2019t bring it up. Presumably, they\u2019d been out drinking all the night before, but none of them even brought a cup of coffee in to the shoot. The band were very well-behaved and it all went like clockwork. My girlfriend was also at the shoot and at the end of the session, Mick came up to me and said: \u201cYou and your bird can come in my limo up to Swarkestone\u201d \u2013 where we were doing more pictures for the album. But I never had any dealings with the Stones after that. \u2022 Best of Proud is at London\u2019s Proud Galleries until 27 October, featuring rare shots of JFK, David Bowie, Mick Jagger and more, by photographers Michael Joseph, Brian Duffy and Norman Seeff.

      "body": "<p>In her memoir, written as letters to her two young daughters, Ali Wong tells them she would be worried if they wanted to become standup comics like her. Wong, who slogged it out on the open-mic circuit, presents a grim account of life on the road: dying onstage, bad food, bad men. She did it for more than a decade before becoming a star seemingly overnight with her first Netflix special, performed while seven-and-a-half months pregnant. Did she ever consider giving up? \u201cThere were times when I thought to myself: \u2018I really don\u2019t know if I can do this for the rest of my life,\u2019\u201d she says on the phone from her home in LA. \u201cYou know, staying at those motels, getting paid that little amount of money. I\u2019m certain I would not have endured. I couldn\u2019t. Especially after having kids.\u201d</p> <p>Luckily for Wong, she didn\u2019t have to; instead, her career blew up. In 2016, Netflix launched her special, <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80101493\" title=\"\">Baby Cobra</a>, and she has since had a second, <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80186940\" title=\"\">Hard Knock Wife</a>. She has also co-written and starred in a romantic comedy film, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/31/always-be-my-maybe-review-netflix-romantic-comedy\">Always Be My Maybe</a>; had her two children; and published Dear Girls, the memoir written for them. Her tours sell out and her peers rave about her (Amy Schumer calls her \u201crevolutionary\u201d, Chris Rock championed her). \u201cIt\u2019s been an unbelievable three years,\u201d she says with some understatement.</p> <p>Offstage, she seems softer and more laid-back than her fierce and foul-mouthed standup persona. In the book, she recalls starting out: \u201cI was very dirty back then. Even now, I\u2019ll look back on those days and think: \u2018God, you were disgusting.\u2019\u201d Which is very funny if you have seen any of Wong\u2019s comedy, because you will know how filthy she is now. In Baby Cobra, there are gags about anal sex and vaginal secretions; in Hard Knock Wife, there are jokes about the things she would like to do to their nanny if he was 25, male and \u201cnot ugly\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY5-8kvMEh0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wY5-8kvMEh0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>When Wong first performed comedy, she was repeatedly told it was all too much. \u201cAll of these people in the industry kept on telling me: \u2018You\u2019re likable and you\u2019re cute, or whatever, but the jokes are really dirty and you\u2019d get booked a lot more, and you\u2019d be a lot more appealing if they were clean,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe people were half-laughing, half-cringing at my jokes. But if you\u2019re successful, people should be too busy laughing to cringe.\u201d Her jokes may not have got cleaner, but they did get better.</p> <p>Even now, she says people (men) told her that her material on childbirth and breastfeeding, which made it into her second special, wasn\u2019t interesting enough. \u201cThere was one guy who said: \u2018It was so much better when you were talking about dating because people can\u2019t relate to breastfeeding,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cBut it\u2019s all I wanted to talk about. That\u2019s kind of the whole point for me with standup, that this is not a network TV sitcom where I have to appeal to everyone.\u201d She pauses for a split second: \u201cI ignored that advice.\u201d</p> <p>Wong is not the first female comic to tell dirty jokes, or talk about sex, but what does feel unusual is her insistence on busting the idea that at the raw, biological level, women aren\u2019t every bit as revolting as men. Why is it still so taboo for women to talk about bodily functions and all the fluids and secretions that ooze out of us? \u201cI was raised to be very open about my body,\u201d she says. Her father was a doctor, and she says her parents were always very straight with her about everything, from sex to the nonexistence of Santa Claus. She thinks for a moment about the question of taboo. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because women feel they want to maintain some mystery that they\u2019re not gross, to be more attractive or something. For me it\u2019s all part of intimacy. That\u2019s how I define intimacy \u2013 living closer and being more honest, closer to what your real desires are \u2013 and it\u2019s exciting.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Still, people thank me for making them feel less embarrassed, less ashamed and less sad about having a miscarriage</p> <footer> <cite>Ali Wong</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Her parents have been to her shows. Worse, so have her in-laws. (She is married to Justin Hakuta, who worked for a tech company but gave it up to support her career.) \u201cThat was nerve-racking. I was much less polished then and I think I talked about Japanese porn and how they blur out the genitals, and I did an imitation of a Japanese porn star screaming. That was pretty wild. But they were really supportive.\u201d</p> <p>I wonder if she is unembarrassable (there are jokes about defecating at work and her promiscuity during her 20s). \u201cNo. For sure, no. I\u2019ll give you an example.\u201d She says that the other day, she and Randall Park, her friend and co-star in Always Be My Maybe, were guest judges on the TV show <a href=\"https://www.bravotv.com/top-chef/videos\">Top Chef</a>. \u201cI saw his face sort of scrunch up and I was like: \u2018Oh my God, I\u2019m so sorry, I think I accidentally farted.\u2019 He moved his chair away from me and he was laughing hysterically, too. It smelled so bad and I was so embarrassed.\u201d She laughs: \u201cI\u2019m definitely embarrassable.\u201d</p> <p>When she had a miscarriage, which she talked about in her first Netflix show, one of her emotions was embarrassment. \u201cI felt a lot of things. I felt sad, but then when I had to tell everybody the news it was something \u2026\u201d She pauses. \u201cEmbarrassment is when you wish you didn\u2019t have to tell somebody something, and it wasn\u2019t something I really wanted to share with everybody but I had to because I had bragged that I was pregnant.\u201d There was a huge reaction to Wong talking about her miscarriage at the time. \u201cIt was very taboo for women to talk about miscarriage and it still kind of is. Still to this day, people walk up to me on the street, thanking me for making them feel less embarrassed, less ashamed and less sad about having a miscarriage.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"28581af1c0d38c3c003f73ae2595c988d85b5c20\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/28581af1c0d38c3c003f73ae2595c988d85b5c20/174_182_1825_1095/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ali Wong\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ali Wong onstage in Austin, Texas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rick Kern/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wong writes that \u201ccomedy requires taking risks\u201d, although she says this is less about subject matter \u2013 nothing is off-limits as long as the joke is well-written \u2013 than about being unafraid of failure. \u201cI guess that\u2019s what I meant about taking risks: for every polished joke you see onstage, there are maybe 100 I tried out that failed. And people in the audience thinking I was a terrible comedian. I was always kind of OK with that.\u201d</p> <p>As a child, Wong was funny but, the youngest of four, she was also a quiet observer. \u201cI would say that I grew up listening, a lot. I have vivid memories of details, things people said and how exactly they said them.\u201d She grew up in San Francisco, where her father, born to Chinese parents, was an anaesthetist, and her mother, born in Vietnam, was a social worker. What was it like to write about her family\u2019s experience of being immigrants? \u201cIt was great because I think about it all the time,\u201d she says. Her paternal grandfather came to the US from China as an eight-year-old, travelling alone by ship. \u201cI see kids and how young they really are and I cannot imagine them coming on a boat by themselves, going to another country to work and be separated from their parents. It really humbles me and makes me grateful and it gave me a huge sense of \u2026\u201d She thinks for a second. \u201cIt\u2019s part of my identity and gave me a very strong work ethic.\u201d</p> <p>A few hours after she got married in San Francisco, Wong performed in her wedding dress at a club in the city; some nights early on in her career, while living in New York, she would perform up to nine sets at different clubs. She has only had four breaks from standup \u2013 her honeymoon, after the births of her two daughters, and when she was shooting the film. These days, once the children are in bed, she turns up unannounced and unpaid at comedy clubs up to five nights a week to try out new material. She describes it as a \u201ccalling. I just really like telling jokes\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I used to dress like a kid, to desexualise myself. I'd be terrified if my daughters wanted to be standups</p> <footer> <cite>Ali Wong</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She writes that she has an \u201cunusual amount of Asian pride\u201d. That came from her parents, she says. \u201cA lot of people talk about how they never saw themselves on screen but my parents actively made sure I saw myself on screen all the time. And we had friends who were artists and we would go to their gallery shows.\u201d Now, she says, she makes an effort to see what other Asian American creators are up to \u2013 whether in TV, literature, art or fashion \u2013 and will introduce her children to it. \u201cI think [if you] consume mainstream pop culture and don\u2019t activate a search for any other niche outlets then you can fall into this feeling that you are inferior.\u201d</p> <p>One male comic once told her that her career was only taking off because she was female and from an ethnic minority. \u201cThat they have that attitude towards me is an indicator of why they are lacking in success. If you think that is the winning combo for success then you\u2019re in trouble.\u201d Wasn\u2019t it infuriating? \u201cYou know, it\u2019s not. If it was someone that I respected it would really bum me out.\u201d</p> <p>When Wong first started performing, she would wear her hair in two cute buns, and dress in \u201chuge cargo pants\u201d. \u201cI used to dress like a kid, to desexualise myself,\u201d she says. \u201cI think that\u2019s the main reason why I would be so terrified if my daughters wanted to be standup comics \u2013 it\u2019s not because of them being onstage, it\u2019s because of the road. You kind of have to go through that.\u201d The comics she respects are the ones who came up through the circuit, rather than those who got famous on a sitcom or YouTube videos. \u201cBut the road is very scary. It always felt unsafe. Even now, when I perform at shows around town, I always ask somebody to walk me back to my car.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3cabb7cf8c492bfac25cc68c496f98970916d09e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3cabb7cf8c492bfac25cc68c496f98970916d09e/0_0_7200_4320/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ali Wong Always Be My Maybe\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ali Wong in a still from her feature film, Always Be My Maybe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ed Araquel/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With the #MeToo movement, comedy has come under scrutiny and there have been allegations of sexual harassment made against several male comics. Has Wong ever experienced sexual harassment at work? She is hesitant for a while, trying to find the words. \u201cI think I\u2019m just not ready to share all that stuff yet, but of course there has been not-great stuff that\u2019s happened. So \u2026 yeah. In terms of how things have changed, I guess nowadays the culture has changed, so that when people do some joke that you\u2019ve heard before about women being \u2018naggy\u2019 or something, it just feels dated. A lot of material that would make fun of women that used to be maybe kind of funny doesn\u2019t feel funny any more.\u201d</p> <p>Wong runs jokes about her husband past him before they make it into her shows. \u201cA hilarious joke that performs well in front of strangers but that my husband hates is not worth getting divorced over,\u201d she says. \u201cMy marriage is much more valuable than a great joke.\u201d Does he mind being talked about? \u201cI get asked that all the time but male comics have been making fun of their wives for so long and I wonder if male comics get asked the same thing. This is what standup comics do: they talk about their life and if they have a partner, they talk about their partner. But I don\u2019t feel like male comics are ever asked about what it\u2019s like for their wife.\u201d I think she is right, but a male comic probably would get asked, were he to make jokes, as Wong does, about the most intimate details of their sex life. \u201cRight,\u201d says Wong, with a laugh. \u201cYes, yes. That\u2019s true.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/sep/18/best-comedians-of-the-21st-century-comics-standup-comedy\">The 50 best comedians of the 21st century</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While her hilarious and unrelenting filthiness is what got Wong noticed, her comedy is full of more nuanced commentary on what it is to be a woman: the double standards of mothering, the pressures of out-earning one\u2019s husband, the reconciliation of bringing up two children under four and doing a job she loves. \u201cI constantly feel like I\u2019m failing at both working and being your mom,\u201d she writes in Dear Girls. In Hard Knock Wife, she talks about the scandal of the US\u2019s lack of paid maternity leave; is she interested in being more political? \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she says, then, as an aside: \u201cAs a British person, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s just so barbaric that we don\u2019t give maternity leave?\u201d Topical, political jokes, she says, have \u201cnever been my forte. I\u2019m also a little bit intimidated because there are so many other comics who are so good at that.\u201d She is well placed to skewer it in the current climate in the US, increasingly hostile to immigrants, but doesn\u2019t seem sure if she wants to go there. Still, she points out, by doing what she loves and doing it well, \u201ceven me putting myself out there sometimes is political. You know what I mean?

In 2016, Netflix launched her special, Baby Cobra, and she has since had a second, Hard Knock Wife. She has also co-written and starred in a romantic comedy film, Always Be My Maybe; had her two children; and published Dear Girls, the memoir written for them. Her tours sell out and her peers rave about her (Amy Schumer calls her \u201crevolutionary\u201d, Chris Rock championed her). \u201cIt\u2019s been an unbelievable three years,\u201d she says with some understatement. Offstage, she seems softer and more laid-back than her fierce and foul-mouthed standup persona. In the book, she recalls starting out: \u201cI was very dirty back then. Even now, I\u2019ll look back on those days and think: \u2018God, you were disgusting.\u2019\u201d Which is very funny if you have seen any of Wong\u2019s comedy, because you will know how filthy she is now. In Baby Cobra, there are gags about anal sex and vaginal secretions; in Hard Knock Wife, there are jokes about the things she would like to do to their nanny if he was 25, male and \u201cnot ugly\u201d. When Wong first performed comedy, she was repeatedly told it was all too much. \u201cAll of these people in the industry kept on telling me: \u2018You\u2019re likable and you\u2019re cute, or whatever, but the jokes are really dirty and you\u2019d get booked a lot more, and you\u2019d be a lot more appealing if they were clean,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe people were half-laughing, half-cringing at my jokes. But if you\u2019re successful, people should be too busy laughing to cringe.\u201d Her jokes may not have got cleaner, but they did get better. Even now, she says people (men) told her that her material on childbirth and breastfeeding, which made it into her second special, wasn\u2019t interesting enough. \u201cThere was one guy who said: \u2018It was so much better when you were talking about dating because people can\u2019t relate to breastfeeding,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cBut it\u2019s all I wanted to talk about. That\u2019s kind of the whole point for me with standup, that this is not a network TV sitcom where I have to appeal to everyone.\u201d She pauses for a split second: \u201cI ignored that advice.\u201d Wong is not the first female comic to tell dirty jokes, or talk about sex, but what does feel unusual is her insistence on busting the idea that at the raw, biological level, women aren\u2019t every bit as revolting as men. Why is it still so taboo for women to talk about bodily functions and all the fluids and secretions that ooze out of us? \u201cI was raised to be very open about my body,\u201d she says. Her father was a doctor, and she says her parents were always very straight with her about everything, from sex to the nonexistence of Santa Claus. She thinks for a moment about the question of taboo. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because women feel they want to maintain some mystery that they\u2019re not gross, to be more attractive or something. For me it\u2019s all part of intimacy. That\u2019s how I define intimacy \u2013 living closer and being more honest, closer to what your real desires are \u2013 and it\u2019s exciting.\u201d Her parents have been to her shows. Worse, so have her in-laws. (She is married to Justin Hakuta, who worked for a tech company but gave it up to support her career.) \u201cThat was nerve-racking. I was much less polished then and I think I talked about Japanese porn and how they blur out the genitals, and I did an imitation of a Japanese porn star screaming. That was pretty wild. But they were really supportive.\u201d I wonder if she is unembarrassable (there are jokes about defecating at work and her promiscuity during her 20s). \u201cNo. For sure, no. I\u2019ll give you an example.\u201d She says that the other day, she and Randall Park, her friend and co-star in Always Be My Maybe, were guest judges on the TV show Top Chef. \u201cI saw his face sort of scrunch up and I was like: \u2018Oh my God, I\u2019m so sorry, I think I accidentally farted.\u2019 He moved his chair away from me and he was laughing hysterically, too. It smelled so bad and I was so embarrassed.\u201d She laughs: \u201cI\u2019m definitely embarrassable.\u201d When she had a miscarriage, which she talked about in her first Netflix show, one of her emotions was embarrassment. \u201cI felt a lot of things. I felt sad, but then when I had to tell everybody the news it was something \u2026\u201d She pauses. \u201cEmbarrassment is when you wish you didn\u2019t have to tell somebody something, and it wasn\u2019t something I really wanted to share with everybody but I had to because I had bragged that I was pregnant.\u201d There was a huge reaction to Wong talking about her miscarriage at the time. \u201cIt was very taboo for women to talk about miscarriage and it still kind of is. Still to this day, people walk up to me on the street, thanking me for making them feel less embarrassed, less ashamed and less sad about having a miscarriage.\u201d Wong writes that \u201ccomedy requires taking risks\u201d, although she says this is less about subject matter \u2013 nothing is off-limits as long as the joke is well-written \u2013 than about being unafraid of failure. \u201cI guess that\u2019s what I meant about taking risks: for every polished joke you see onstage, there are maybe 100 I tried out that failed. And people in the audience thinking I was a terrible comedian. I was always kind of OK with that.\u201d As a child, Wong was funny but, the youngest of four, she was also a quiet observer. \u201cI would say that I grew up listening, a lot. I have vivid memories of details, things people said and how exactly they said them.\u201d She grew up in San Francisco, where her father, born to Chinese parents, was an anaesthetist, and her mother, born in Vietnam, was a social worker. What was it like to write about her family\u2019s experience of being immigrants? \u201cIt was great because I think about it all the time,\u201d she says. Her paternal grandfather came to the US from China as an eight-year-old, travelling alone by ship. \u201cI see kids and how young they really are and I cannot imagine them coming on a boat by themselves, going to another country to work and be separated from their parents. It really humbles me and makes me grateful and it gave me a huge sense of \u2026\u201d She thinks for a second. \u201cIt\u2019s part of my identity and gave me a very strong work ethic.\u201d A few hours after she got married in San Francisco, Wong performed in her wedding dress at a club in the city; some nights early on in her career, while living in New York, she would perform up to nine sets at different clubs. She has only had four breaks from standup \u2013 her honeymoon, after the births of her two daughters, and when she was shooting the film. These days, once the children are in bed, she turns up unannounced and unpaid at comedy clubs up to five nights a week to try out new material. She describes it as a \u201ccalling. I just really like telling jokes\u201d. She writes that she has an \u201cunusual amount of Asian pride\u201d. That came from her parents, she says. \u201cA lot of people talk about how they never saw themselves on screen but my parents actively made sure I saw myself on screen all the time. And we had friends who were artists and we would go to their gallery shows.\u201d Now, she says, she makes an effort to see what other Asian American creators are up to \u2013 whether in TV, literature, art or fashion \u2013 and will introduce her children to it. \u201cI think [if you] consume mainstream pop culture and don\u2019t activate a search for any other niche outlets then you can fall into this feeling that you are inferior.\u201d One male comic once told her that her career was only taking off because she was female and from an ethnic minority. \u201cThat they have that attitude towards me is an indicator of why they are lacking in success. If you think that is the winning combo for success then you\u2019re in trouble.\u201d Wasn\u2019t it infuriating? \u201cYou know, it\u2019s not. If it was someone that I respected it would really bum me out.\u201d When Wong first started performing, she would wear her hair in two cute buns, and dress in \u201chuge cargo pants\u201d. \u201cI used to dress like a kid, to desexualise myself,\u201d she says. \u201cI think that\u2019s the main reason why I would be so terrified if my daughters wanted to be standup comics \u2013 it\u2019s not because of them being onstage, it\u2019s because of the road. You kind of have to go through that.\u201d The comics she respects are the ones who came up through the circuit, rather than those who got famous on a sitcom or YouTube videos. \u201cBut the road is very scary. It always felt unsafe. Even now, when I perform at shows around town, I always ask somebody to walk me back to my car.\u201d With the #MeToo movement, comedy has come under scrutiny and there have been allegations of sexual harassment made against several male comics. Has Wong ever experienced sexual harassment at work? She is hesitant for a while, trying to find the words. \u201cI think I\u2019m just not ready to share all that stuff yet, but of course there has been not-great stuff that\u2019s happened. So \u2026 yeah. In terms of how things have changed, I guess nowadays the culture has changed, so that when people do some joke that you\u2019ve heard before about women being \u2018naggy\u2019 or something, it just feels dated. A lot of material that would make fun of women that used to be maybe kind of funny doesn\u2019t feel funny any more.\u201d Wong runs jokes about her husband past him before they make it into her shows. \u201cA hilarious joke that performs well in front of strangers but that my husband hates is not worth getting divorced over,\u201d she says. \u201cMy marriage is much more valuable than a great joke.\u201d Does he mind being talked about? \u201cI get asked that all the time but male comics have been making fun of their wives for so long and I wonder if male comics get asked the same thing. This is what standup comics do: they talk about their life and if they have a partner, they talk about their partner. But I don\u2019t feel like male comics are ever asked about what it\u2019s like for their wife.\u201d I think she is right, but a male comic probably would get asked, were he to make jokes, as Wong does, about the most intimate details of their sex life. \u201cRight,\u201d says Wong, with a laugh. \u201cYes, yes. That\u2019s true.\u201d While her hilarious and unrelenting filthiness is what got Wong noticed, her comedy is full of more nuanced commentary on what it is to be a woman: the double standards of mothering, the pressures of out-earning one\u2019s husband, the reconciliation of bringing up two children under four and doing a job she loves. \u201cI constantly feel like I\u2019m failing at both working and being your mom,\u201d she writes in Dear Girls. In Hard Knock Wife, she talks about the scandal of the US\u2019s lack of paid maternity leave; is she interested in being more political? \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she says, then, as an aside: \u201cAs a British person, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s just so barbaric that we don\u2019t give maternity leave?\u201d Topical, political jokes, she says, have \u201cnever been my forte. I\u2019m also a little bit intimidated because there are so many other comics who are so good at that.\u201d She is well placed to skewer it in the current climate in the US, increasingly hostile to immigrants, but doesn\u2019t seem sure if she wants to go there. Still, she points out, by doing what she loves and doing it well, \u201ceven me putting myself out there sometimes is political. You know what I mean? Some people can\u2019t stand that.\u201d Dear Girls is out today, published by Canongate, available for \u00a313.19 from Guardian Bookshop. \u2022 Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

During research, he ran across an article about Crispr and was stunned by the science. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it, that we could actually edit the essence of life, DNA.\u201d Later, over a dinner conversation, he spoke to Leeor Kaufman, who convinced him the material would make a good documentary, if, and only if, there were advancements being made. They found an entire world teeming to express their feelings on the avant-garde technology. \u201cThis is the beginning of a new revolution and, fortunately, we were making these calls right when these pioneers were just getting going,\u201d said Egender. \u201cThe moment we started talking to people, we understood how there were so many different things that altering DNA can affect, whether it\u2019s medicine or the environment or obviously designing animals, plants and humans,\u201d said Kaufman.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIIVh7H6nvI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WIIVh7H6nvI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>For Egender and Kaufman, the series had to tell the broader, more intricate story of genetic engineering, a story filled with great risk, benefits, consequences, emotions, sentiments and future, to better illuminate the field and further the discussion on the technology. \u201cWe\u2019re not just talking about science, these are actual things that are happening and the stories are very complex and ongoing,\u201d stated Kaufman.</p> <p>For example, many are depending on gene therapy treatment to change and possibly save lives. But, the series shows, the treatments are expensive, with some emerging drugs costing over $500,000, and patients are often at the mercy of startup genetic therapy companies who choose to weigh the \u201cmeaning\u201d of the treatment versus the cost for the patient, leaving many to fight their insurance companies for the cost of treatment.</p> <p>One episode shows the uses for the technology in a changing climate. Due to the climate crisis, New Zealand is suffering a boom in rodents, invasive species which threaten the native bird population. With genetic engineering, Dr Kevin Esvelt, an evolutionary engineer profiled in the series, hopes to foster a process called gene drive in rodents, a technology designed to transmit a particular suite of genes throughout a population through breeding. While it would effectively solve the problem, it also raises fears among New Zealanders of eugenics and ecological collapse.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"23547f5d5e568f37723a1638a4d60545f6c90757\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23547f5d5e568f37723a1638a4d60545f6c90757/0_0_3840_1632/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A still from Unnatural Selection\" width=\"1000\" height=\"425\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from Unnatural Selection.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They are not alone in their worry. The series is haunted by feelings of ambivalence from the scientists who are cautious about tipping the scales towards a possible dystopian future. Even Dr Doudna, the scientist who co-discovered the Crispr gene sequence, regularly expresses caution about gene engineering. No longer worried whether the technology will work, the scientists are concerned it might be used against people and push the world toward doom. Kaufman described their caution: \u201cThese people are already living tomorrow\u2019s dilemmas, tomorrow\u2019s ethics, tomorrow\u2019s financial world in a way and we can learn about tomorrow from them.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Esvelt pioneered the gene drive technique and is hopeful it can partially temper the effects of climate change. But even he remarks, \u201cThe prospect of a wave of genetically modified anything sweeping generation after generation, geographically expanding into city, country, across continents, is utterly terrifying.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"953e7490c8c46dae3fa76b0faf30ba064d45121e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/953e7490c8c46dae3fa76b0faf30ba064d45121e/0_0_3840_1632/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A still from Unnatural Selection\" width=\"1000\" height=\"425\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from Unnatural Selection.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although he decides to explore the unknown, despite his ambivalence, others are not so optimistic about the use and development of technology. In the series, environmentalist Jim Thomas describes the potential magnitude of the technology: \u201cTo me, it\u2019s the most high-leverage technology I\u2019ve seen after maybe nuclear power.\u201d Politically, the technology raises several eyebrows. Activist Dana Perls poses the question: \u201cGenetic engineering brings up the issue of control. Who is profiting? Who is controlling the technology? Agro-business companies, chemical companies, mega-companies are interested because it allows them to control nature.\u201d</p> <p>Egender acknowledged the fear is valid but opts to consider it from another angle. \u201cThere may be reasons to fear the technology. There may be reasons to champion the technology. But I think what is certain is that, as a society, we need to better understand the technology and start discussing it so that we collectively can make some of these decisions, rather than leaving it up to only the people in the know, only the people in the lab, only the people with the power.\u201d Kaufman agreed: \u201cA lot of people when they hear about it for the first time, a lot of the reactions are fear.\u201d He continued: \u201cThe best thing we can do as a society is not to fear it, but to address it and then understand what specifically we think, where specifically we shouldn\u2019t go and where we actually should or could because it can make a kid see or it can make people in Burkina Faso not suffer from a horrible disease that in other places people are not suffering from \u2026\u201d</p> <p>Unnatural Selection demonstrates the worry of many, and the hope of others, threaded into a huge tapestry of possibility of a more perfect future. While so many things may not come to pass, one thing, however, is clear. \u201cWe know very well from human history we\u2019re not going to put this back in the bottle. The technology is there. It\u2019s going to be used,\u201d says Kaufman. While he doubts the series will change the minds of the public about genetic engineering, but hopes it will educate some about both the benefits and risks of genetic engineering. \u201cWe don\u2019t expect anyone to decide by a show on Netflix. We expect people to learn from a show on Netflix.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>Unnatural Selection is available on Netflix from 18 October</p></li> </ul>",

Even Dr Doudna, the scientist who co-discovered the Crispr gene sequence, regularly expresses caution about gene engineering. No longer worried whether the technology will work, the scientists are concerned it might be used against people and push the world toward doom. Kaufman described their caution: \u201cThese people are already living tomorrow\u2019s dilemmas, tomorrow\u2019s ethics, tomorrow\u2019s financial world in a way and we can learn about tomorrow from them.\u201d Dr Esvelt pioneered the gene drive technique and is hopeful it can partially temper the effects of climate change. But even he remarks, \u201cThe prospect of a wave of genetically modified anything sweeping generation after generation, geographically expanding into city, country, across continents, is utterly terrifying.\u201d Although he decides to explore the unknown, despite his ambivalence, others are not so optimistic about the use and development of technology. In the series, environmentalist Jim Thomas describes the potential magnitude of the technology: \u201cTo me, it\u2019s the most high-leverage technology I\u2019ve seen after maybe nuclear power.\u201d Politically, the technology raises several eyebrows. Activist Dana Perls poses the question: \u201cGenetic engineering brings up the issue of control. Who is profiting? Who is controlling the technology? Agro-business companies, chemical companies, mega-companies are interested because it allows them to control nature.\u201d Egender acknowledged the fear is valid but opts to consider it from another angle. \u201cThere may be reasons to fear the technology. There may be reasons to champion the technology. But I think what is certain is that, as a society, we need to better understand the technology and start discussing it so that we collectively can make some of these decisions, rather than leaving it up to only the people in the know, only the people in the lab, only the people with the power.\u201d Kaufman agreed: \u201cA lot of people when they hear about it for the first time, a lot of the reactions are fear.\u201d He continued: \u201cThe best thing we can do as a society is not to fear it, but to address it and then understand what specifically we think, where specifically we shouldn\u2019t go and where we actually should or could because it can make a kid see or it can make people in Burkina Faso not suffer from a horrible disease that in other places people are not suffering from \u2026\u201d Unnatural Selection demonstrates the worry of many, and the hope of others, threaded into a huge tapestry of possibility of a more perfect future. While so many things may not come to pass, one thing, however, is clear. \u201cWe know very well from human history we\u2019re not going to put this back in the bottle. The technology is there. It\u2019s going to be used,\u201d says Kaufman. While he doubts the series will change the minds of the public about genetic engineering, but hopes it will educate some about both the benefits and risks of genetic engineering. \u201cWe don\u2019t expect anyone to decide by a show on Netflix. We expect people to learn from a show on Netflix.\u201d Unnatural Selection is available on Netflix from 18 October",

      "body": "<p>There was no warning and no screech of brakes \u2013 just a huge bang, and then we were crashing. I was sitting with my back to the direction of travel, towards Paddington, and felt the impact through my seat, as well as hearing it. For a moment or two, it seemed that we might be all right, because the train continued on its way. But then we derailed, and the wheels started to plough over the sleepers and through the ballast beside the tracks. I became aware of a bright yellow light over my right shoulder, and realised that it was a fireball. It moved along the outside of the carriage from front to rear, and then was gone. The carriage tilted to its right and, out of the window to my left, which was now below me, I could see one or two small fires. A body drifted slowly past that same window. It was that of a middle-aged male. The body was intact, and the man\u2019s eyes were closed. I was struck by the peaceful look on his face as he rolled slowly below us. I remember hoping that he was not hurt, and wondering where on Earth he had come from.</p> <p>Back then, in 1999, by a strange coincidence, I was acting as junior counsel for Great Western Trains Ltd at the public inquiry into the Southall rail crash, which had taken place two years earlier, in September 1997, and killed seven people. Many weeks earlier, I had been chatting to Richard George, managing director of Great Western Trains Ltd, about his experience as a passenger in the Southall crash. He had demonstrated to me how he had got out of his seat and crouched in the aisle as the train had slowed.</p> <p>Now, in the final stages of the Ladbroke Grove crash, I got up from my seat, again on a Great Western train, and with my legs apart and half-crouching like a snowboarder, copied the position he had demonstrated to me in Swindon all those weeks ago. It was not easy, because our carriage was now almost on its side. Then we stopped and there was silence. I thought I had better say something. After all, did I not know more about train crashes than the other passengers? I remembered Richard George telling me that the train was the safest place to be after a crash, because there may be another train in the area, or some live electric cabling. I shouted, and my voice sounded strange in the chaotic silence: \u201cDon\u2019t panic. And everyone stay in the carriage.\u201d</p> <p>Someone murmured disagreement, and a man sitting on the opposite side of the carriage, who would ordinarily have been a few feet beside me to my left, but was now some feet below me, said that we should not break the windows because there were fires burning on the track below. Then someone shouted from behind me that we could get out through the end of the carriage, and I became conscious that people were starting to move. I looked behind, and saw daylight through what had been the end of the carriage. There was no panic and no screams of pain. It was all rather orderly, as we started to make our way towards the daylight, using the sides of the seats, now horizontal instead of vertical, as our walkway.</p> <p>Immediately in front of me a young woman stopped and asked me whether she should try to find her handbag. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry too much about your handbag,\u201d I replied, glancing nervously at the fires burning on the track below us.</p> <p>She said nothing more and started to move towards the daylight. I noticed that she seemed to be limping, and then glanced down and saw that she was wearing only one shoe. She climbed out ahead of me, and I was helped to the ground by two men who must have been among the first out of the carriage. I thanked them and walked into the dazzling sunshine and to the southern trackside. Immediately in front of our carriage, and lying on its side, was the carriage that had been in front of ours. Behind our carriage, and at a drunken angle to it, was another carriage, which I later learned was coach H, which we had swept past during the crash. On the track in front of our carriage was a blackened and smoking section of the train\u2019s wheels. The locomotive was nowhere to be seen. The sirens had already started to sound as I walked up the bank.</p> <p>As I stood in the sunshine, none of it seemed real. I was working on an inquiry into a train crash, and now apparently I had been involved in one. But I could not see what we had crashed into. The diesel locomotive seemed to have vanished. The previous week, I had heard vivid evidence from those who had experienced the Southall crash at first hand. For a moment, I wondered whether all of this was actually happening, or whether I was in the middle of a macabre and complicated dream, brought on by weeks of work on the Southall crash Inquiry.</p> <p>I saw burned and blackened figures walking up and down the embankment. One man had terrible burns. The skin was hanging off his hands like a spider\u2019s web, his face was black and bloodied and his trousers were in tatters. I asked another man, whose face was also black and bleeding, and who was obviously in pain, whether he wanted to sit down. He said he didn\u2019t think so, because his back was terribly painful. Beside me, two women held each other and sobbed, their bodies shaking from top to toe.</p> <p>It was some minutes before the fire on coach H took hold. Soon, there was a vast column of black smoke rising hundreds of feet into the air from the coach, and I watched transfixed as it burned. I suspect we stayed at the trackside for 20-30 minutes. The police arrived and started to take charge, and to create some order out of the jumbled events beside the railway line. Eventually, an officer directed the uninjured and the walking wounded to a nearby school.</p> <p>Once there, I felt as useless as I had at the trackside, and tried not to get in the way. Some seriously injured passengers arrived. A woman was breathing through an oxygen mask. An elderly white-haired man was placed carefully on a blanket by some paramedics. Another woman had burns to her back, which were being bathed. I shall never forget the smell in that school: a mixture of oil, diesel and burned flesh. For days afterwards, when I thought about or relived the crash, I was able to summon back that same smell.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Many months later, I would hear the accounts of other survivors as they recounted their experience to Lord Cullen\u2019s public inquiry. Until 8.09am, it had been a mundane morning for Philip Scotcher. He boarded the train at Kemble, and sat in coach B near the back of the train. He felt and heard the crash. He described a sort of scary, eerie silence once the train had come to a complete stop. Then came a call from further towards the front of the coach. People began to panic, and Scotcher stood on his seat and shouted for everyone to calm down. He left through a door on the north side of the train and jumped to the ground. He looked immediately to his right, and saw the smoking remains of what had been the front carriage of the Thames train coming out of London, which had smashed into us. He saw a woman lying on the ground, with half of her body in a pool of flames. Her clothing and her hair were on fire. He dropped his bag and ran over to answer her screams for help. He grabbed her hand and dragged her back about 10 metres or so away from the fire. He found a tiny block of wood, about the size of his hand, and patted out the fire that was on her body.</p> <p>He left the woman in the care of the other man, returned to the burning Thames train, and grabbed a fire extinguisher. This soon ran out of water, and he threw it to one side. Scotcher looked into the inferno. He later described the scene to the inquiry:</p> <p>\u201cIt was then I saw another gentleman, and he was sort of sitting right in the middle of the fire and he was just horrifically burning. He was completely slumped over, and I heard him moan or make a noise, so I made a dash and put my hand round his waist and I remember saying to him: \u2018Please, please, you have to stand up. For both our sakes we have to walk out of here.\u2019 I could tell he was a very big gentleman and once he did stand up it was apparent he was very tall, I think he is actually 6ft 7in and good sort of 18-20 stone, so I could not physically carry him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWas he on fire?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, he was.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat did you do with him once you had taken hold of him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, we staggered back. I was then intending to take him towards the side of the track so that he could recover over there. We both then fell down.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWas he still on fire?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, slightly, but not as much. By falling down he extinguished quite a bit of the fire on himself. I was then able to put out the other fire that was on his legs and feet and I think some small amounts on his upper body.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow did you put that fire out?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust patted it very quickly with my hands. I then once again put my arm round him and said: \u2018Please, please, you\u2019re going to have to stand up. You\u2019re going to have to walk out of here.\u2019 All credit to him, he stood up and we walked the best we could.\u201d</p> <p>Once they got clear of the fire, Scotcher remained with the man, an American, Mike Adams, to comfort him, trying to make \u201cabsolute mindless chitchat about anything but the crash\u201d. He looked after Adams until, after what seemed like a lifetime, the emergency services arrived.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"89687cca0749aee662592eed4ac06c9afd6e85f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89687cca0749aee662592eed4ac06c9afd6e85f3/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rescue workers at the scene crash in west London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rescue workers at the scene crash in west London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toby Melville/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Words do not exist adequately to describe what happened in coach H of the Great Western train. This was the carriage immediately behind the diesel locomotive, making it the front passenger carriage. Three men who were standing at the front of the coach died when they were propelled into the back of the locomotive. Two more, who were sitting in window seats at the very front of the coach were thrown out and died, and a sixth passenger, who hit her head and sustained injuries that were probably fatal, remained inside the carriage after it caught fire. Her body was found days later by the emergency services. Mercifully, it is almost certain that she was unconscious when the fire broke out, and would have known nothing of what happened.</p> <p>In simple terms, the coach was derailed to the south, slewed through almost 180 degrees, tilted to its side, and then caught fire. But that simple description does not begin to convey what actually happened in the coach. For there was not one fire, but two. The first was a fireball that passed inside the carriage, causing horrific injuries to a handful of the passengers. That was followed by thick black smoke, which made the carriage go dark.</p> <p>Chris Goodall, a passenger in Coach H, described to the inquiry what happened: \u201cI think other people have referred to the massive increase in temperature that took place within a few seconds. That is my observation as well. I do not believe, though, it was a result of fire inside the carriage at all close to me. I was aware at the time also of the air pressure, or the apparent air pressure inside the carriage falling, possibly as a result of the consumption of oxygen by the fire outside. So it was both very hot immediately and I had a strong sensation of fighting for breath very soon after the train had come to rest. So, at this stage, I felt that I was almost certainly going to be burned to death in the fire.\u201d</p> <p>Goodall escaped from the carriage, and then he turned around, intending to return to rescue any other passengers who might be trapped. As he did so, he caught sight of a man in the rear of what had been the power car. The man was trapped, and there were pools of fire on the ground around the power car. Goodall tried to free him, but very shortly afterwards, the man died. By now it was too late for him to help anyone else in coach H, as the carriage was engulfed in flames.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>I had spent much of my career at the bar dealing with personal injury cases. Sprinkled among them were cases where the psychiatric or psychological consequences of an accident were more serious than any physical injuries. Eminent experts had devised diagnostic criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the first of which was exposure to a life-threatening event. Many individuals caught up in transport disasters had been compensated for PTSD developed as a result of their experiences. So I knew a fair amount about the effects of accidents upon the human mind. How would I react? Was I to be immune from the mental effects of involvement in the crash? I watched myself, as if with a third eye, and waited.</p> <p>Wednesday, the day after the crash, was full of relief. I had survived pretty well unscathed. The newspapers carried pictures of the carnage. If all the days had been like Wednesday, there would not have been much of a problem. But Wednesday became Thursday, and Thursday was, for me, the worst day. The beautiful weather of the previous two days had gone. At breakfast, the Times brought the sickening news that 28 people were now confirmed dead. It looked as if the death toll might rise to well over 100. The police apparently believed that the burnt out coach H might contain the remains of up to 70 people.</p> <p>I did not know that these figures would soon be shown to be dramatically overstated. Guilt at having done so little to help, and exhaustion, swept across me. I lay down on my bed, watching the light patter of rain on the roof light in the bedroom. I felt the tears starting and I did not try to stop them. Later that morning, standing in the kitchen having just read an affecting story about one of the dead train drivers, I again started to sob.</p> <p>Friday was another bad day, following another sleepless night. During the course of the morning, the police started to release the names of the dead, one of whom I knew, and had spoken to a minute or two before the crash as he made his way to the front of the train. I felt overwhelmed by it all, and had no idea how I could rise above it. I would try to concentrate on a conversation, but would find myself unable to do so. My mind would drift back to the sounds and the smells of the crash, ploughing through the ballast, leaving my seat to crouch in the aisle, shouting to the others in the carriage, watching the sad parade of the injured along the trackside. But as the days passed, and with the help of my loved ones, normality slowly returned. </p> <p>A month after the crash, I was asked whether I would be prepared to represent Great Western at the public inquiry into the Ladbroke Grove crash to be chaired by Lord Cullen, a senior Scottish judge who had already presided over inquiries into the Piper Alpha oil rig explosion and the Dunblane shootings.</p> <p>I needed time to consider. I was struggling to get over the crash, and the idea of reimmersing myself in it for months on end was unappealing. It also felt wrong to think of acting for a company involved in a crash I had been in, however blameless the company may have been. On the other hand, Jonathan Caplan QC, Great Western\u2019s leading counsel, was unavailable for the Ladbroke Grove inquiry, having already been booked to spend most of 2000 at a criminal trial in Hong Kong. If I declined, Great Western would have to find a new team of barristers, and I would have to find other work that was unlikely to be as interesting, as well-paid or as high-profile.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the end, the decision was more or less made for me. A few days later, the government announced that part of the Cullen Inquiry would be fused with the Southall Inquiry, and that Lord Cullen and Prof John Uff (the chair of the Southall inquiry) would sit as joint chairs of an inquiry to consider railway safety issues. Caplan felt I should agree to act if I could cope with it emotionally. So I said yes, and booked myself in for a further year of railway crash work.</p> <p>The first day of hearings was scheduled to be 10 May 2000. The usual van-load of documents arrived in my chambers in March, five months after the crash, and for the first time, I was able to understand what had happened aboard our train that morning. I started to read the experiences of others who had been in coaches in front of and behind mine.</p> <p>Reading the statements brought back the sounds and smells of the crash. All of the guilt I had felt as the numbers of supposed dead and injured had escalated in the days after the crash came back to me. What I had not appreciated until now was that passengers in all parts of our train except coach A had been in danger. Some had been unable to open doors. In one carriage, there had been a fair amount of panic.</p> <p>As I read these harrowing accounts, my stomach churned. I should not be doing this case. But it was too late to get out of it. I read, too, of the selflessness and heroism of many of the passengers. Other difficult questions nagged at my conscience. What had I been doing while all of this was going on? </p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In early April, Lord Cullen held the first of two meetings for the passengers to provide their input into the inquiry process. Only the passengers, not the lawyers, were permitted to speak. Since I was both, I could choose, but I had no desire to draw attention to myself and wanted to hear what others had to say. I sat at the back and kept silent. For the first time since the morning of the crash, I saw some of its consequences. I saw a woman wearing a transparent face mask being helped out of the meeting room. She looked to be in agonising pain. A youngish man who had been on the Thames train stood up to say something. He was wearing a black body corset and was obviously in pain. I knew many more by sight, both passengers and lawyers. Some of the reality of the horror of the crash, a horror I had largely escaped, seeped into me. Once again, I felt I should not be doing this case. I was too close to it and the memories were all too raw. I started to dread the first phase of the hearings, during which the passengers would tell Lord Cullen of what happened on that fateful morning.</p> <p>The hearings duly started on 10 May at the Methodist Central Hall, opposite Westminster Abbey, with a day-long opening statement by Robert Owen QC, counsel to the inquiry. He dealt in detail with the crash and the subsequent fire. I felt sick as he did so, and tried to concentrate upon staring at the computer screen in front of me and blotting out his words. I was fascinated and repelled in equal measure. He confirmed that the driver of our train, Brian Cooper, was in no way to blame for the accident.</p> <p>By the end of the first week of the evidence, I felt 10 years older. The inquiry heard the evidence from passengers on the Great Western train first, starting at the rear, in coach A, and moving steadily forwards. The witnesses from our train gave their evidence, in the main, without anger or rancour. The experience was still fresh for them, and often tears welled up in their eyes, or they had to stop to compose themselves before telling of the more horrendous aspects of their ordeal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d9a597e6eeab77c9e23f7e6ae3bbfb27ab3a661a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9a597e6eeab77c9e23f7e6ae3bbfb27ab3a661a/0_0_2048_1402/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Overhead electrical equipment near Paddington, often described by train drivers as being like \u2018spaghetti\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"685\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Overhead electrical equipment near Paddington, often described by train drivers as being like \u2018spaghetti\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For me, hearing the evidence of those who had been in the Thames train was like hearing about a different crash. I had not seen the Thames train at any stage, as we had been passing through the fireball when it would have been visible to me. Twenty-four of the 31 people who died had been travelling in the Thames train. Of these, all but one had been in the front carriage. Only six people from that carriage, which had been obliterated in the crash, had survived. One witness who had been trapped in the wreckage was a young Australian, Majella Lyons. She had been given a glimpse of hell:</p> <p>\u201cI just remember a big thump, a crash, and I was jolted up in my seat and then it became more intense. The whole time I kept thinking that we had perhaps hit something. I just assumed it was going to stop, it was going to stop, it was going to stop, but it just kept crashing. I was thrown up and down on my back and everything came in on top of me and I was cocooned under rubbish, under rubble. But there was a first impact which jolted me up and then the further impact which threw me down on to the floor, I assume, under seats and stuff.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWas the train still moving?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. As it was moving I could see things just smashing down on top of me, and I can remember seeing things coming toward me as I was flying and, as I landed, I just saw everything come in and it suddenly got very dark. There were two metal supports and I was just being jolted from side to side by those, but my legs from here down were completely pinned in. I could not see, but lots of rubble and chairs and things. So I was in a little cocoon held up by the two bars and stuff falling down.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCould you hear other people?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAt the time I think I heard someone say things like: \u2018Not again.\u2019 But then at the actual impact, that might have been after, but at the impact it was just a lot of noise and too much noise to hear people. But then when it stopped, there was this silence. It was everybody, I assume, just thinking, trying to understand, come to terms with what had happened. Then there was moaning, lots of moaning and screaming and calling out and lots of noise.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWere you able to move?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I could not. My left leg, I could just move my toes, so I knew they were OK. My right foot I could actually bend up and down, but then both of those became numb. But I had the feeling that I could feel my feet, my toes and my fingers and I knew my arms and my torso were still there, so I knew I had not been cut in half and I was just so thankful \u2013 I could not believe that I was alive.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about your head?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, my head was smashed right down on to the floor. Yes, I could move it a bit, yes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you think that you may have damaged your skull?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. It was such a heavy force and I was lying down for hours and hours. I actually thought there was \u2013 in impact there was a big rush of hot fluids from the person on top of me, I presume it was blood, so I felt wet and hot, and my head was down and so it was covered in liquid and glass and stuff. A while later a light spilt in. They were trying to break through the side of the carriage. Eventually I saw some light to my left and they were telling me \u2013 I could hear their voices so I knew they were over there, so I put my hand through and they grabbed my hand. It was amazing. They just held my hand, tightening my hand, putting it in a drip and stuff. But first of all they passed through an oxygen mask.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think then someone was holding your hand for the three or four hours that it took to free you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I had a few different people, I think. I am not sure. I had different people. There were ambulance and also fire brigade, and they were absolutely amazing. They were the most compassionate people and they were wonderful.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Day after day, the pieces of the jigsaw were slowly but steadily revealed and put into place. During the middle section of the inquiry, a series of Railtrack witnesses dealt with the history of the signalling system in the 0-2 mile area west of Paddington. It was a lamentable story, and revealed inertia and incompetence on a worrying scale.</p> <p>The immediate cause was straightforward enough. SN109 was the most notorious signal on that part of the railway network. It had only been installed a few years previously, but already it had been \u201cspadded\u201d \u2013 railway talk for a train going through a red light without stopping, \u201csignal passed at danger\u201d \u2013 on numerous occasions. Michael Hodder, driver of the Thames train, had driven through a red light at SN109, then carried on until his route took him on to the fast main line coming into London. But why? He was an inexperienced train driver, but he was an intelligent and level-headed man. Either he had not seen SN109 at all, or he must have thought that the signal allowed him to proceed.</p> <p>The construction of a new line to Heathrow airport in the early 1990s had required the erection of electrical equipment, and this was carried on overhead cables above the trains. Train drivers had to try to pick out the signal that governed the passage of their train through a maze of overhead electrical equipment, which they often described as being like spaghetti. SN109 was passed at red with worrying frequency. In October 1995, there was a crash at Royal Oak, near Paddington, and an inquiry was held to determine the causes. A Railtrack engineer submitted a report analysing the causes of the high number of spads in the Paddington area and suggesting 11 possible improvements.</p> <p>In the following years, committees were set up, talking shops opened, any number of suggestions were made and reports written, but, on the ground, virtually nothing happened to improve the situation. Railtrack was supposed to convene a signal sighting committee to investigate any signal that had been spadded more than once within a set timeframe. Six of the spads at SN109 should have resulted in the convening of a signal sighting committee. Not once did that happen.</p> <p>Thus when Hodder set off from platform nine on the morning of 5 October 1999, he was driving a route that was known to be very difficult for train drivers. He had qualified as a driver just 14 days before the crash. In various respects, his training had been inadequate. He had not been instructed directly about the risk of spadding at particular signals. He had not attended a spad awareness day. The tests he had taken to become a train driver had not included questions about the area between Paddington and Ladbroke Grove.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/apr/18/how-to-identify-a-body-the-marchioness-disaster-and-my-life-in-forensic-pathology\">How to identify a body: the Marchioness disaster and my life in forensic pathology</a> </p> </aside>  <p>None of this provided a full explanation for why he had not seen or reacted to the red signal. I have never had any doubt about the answer, even though the evidence from experts at the inquiry was equivocal. All my memories of the crash were drenched in the bright sunlight of that morning. It was cloudless, and the sun would have shone directly on to the east-facing signals that controlled Hodder\u2019s journey out of London. Anyone who has driven a car will have experienced the effect that sunlight can have on traffic lights, making it difficult or impossible to appreciate the colour that is actually illuminated.</p> <p>The more I thought about it, the more likely it seemed to me not only that Hodder had misread SN109 as yellow, but that he had also misread the signal before it, which also pointed east. He had accelerated through SN109, and continued driving for 700 metres, unaware of what he had done. Just seconds before the crash, as his route took him on to the main line, he would have seen the Great Western high-speed train bearing down upon him at a little over 80mph. He applied the emergency brake, but it was hopeless. For a moment, he may have looked at Brian Cooper sitting behind the controls of the Great Western train. Neither man would have believed what was happening as the two trains closed in on each other. Seconds later, both were dead. Hodder\u2019s fateful journey had taken a little under three and a half minutes.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "There was no warning and no screech of brakes \u2013 just a huge bang, and then we were crashing. I was sitting with my back to the direction of travel, towards Paddington, and felt the impact through my seat, as well as hearing it. For a moment or two, it seemed that we might be all right, because the train continued on its way. But then we derailed, and the wheels started to plough over the sleepers and through the ballast beside the tracks. I became aware of a bright yellow light over my right shoulder, and realised that it was a fireball. It moved along the outside of the carriage from front to rear, and then was gone. The carriage tilted to its right and, out of the window to my left, which was now below me, I could see one or two small fires. A body drifted slowly past that same window. It was that of a middle-aged male. The body was intact, and the man\u2019s eyes were closed. I was struck by the peaceful look on his face as he rolled slowly below us. I remember hoping that he was not hurt, and wondering where on Earth he had come from. Back then, in 1999, by a strange coincidence, I was acting as junior counsel for Great Western Trains Ltd at the public inquiry into the Southall rail crash, which had taken place two years earlier, in September 1997, and killed seven people. Many weeks earlier, I had been chatting to Richard George, managing director of Great Western Trains Ltd, about his experience as a passenger in the Southall crash. He had demonstrated to me how he had got out of his seat and crouched in the aisle as the train had slowed. Now, in the final stages of the Ladbroke Grove crash, I got up from my seat, again on a Great Western train, and with my legs apart and half-crouching like a snowboarder, copied the position he had demonstrated to me in Swindon all those weeks ago. It was not easy, because our carriage was now almost on its side. Then we stopped and there was silence. I thought I had better say something. After all, did I not know more about train crashes than the other passengers? I remembered Richard George telling me that the train was the safest place to be after a crash, because there may be another train in the area, or some live electric cabling. I shouted, and my voice sounded strange in the chaotic silence: \u201cDon\u2019t panic. And everyone stay in the carriage.\u201d Someone murmured disagreement, and a man sitting on the opposite side of the carriage, who would ordinarily have been a few feet beside me to my left, but was now some feet below me, said that we should not break the windows because there were fires burning on the track below. Then someone shouted from behind me that we could get out through the end of the carriage, and I became conscious that people were starting to move. I looked behind, and saw daylight through what had been the end of the carriage. There was no panic and no screams of pain. It was all rather orderly, as we started to make our way towards the daylight, using the sides of the seats, now horizontal instead of vertical, as our walkway. Immediately in front of me a young woman stopped and asked me whether she should try to find her handbag. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry too much about your handbag,\u201d I replied, glancing nervously at the fires burning on the track below us. She said nothing more and started to move towards the daylight. I noticed that she seemed to be limping, and then glanced down and saw that she was wearing only one shoe. She climbed out ahead of me, and I was helped to the ground by two men who must have been among the first out of the carriage. I thanked them and walked into the dazzling sunshine and to the southern trackside. Immediately in front of our carriage, and lying on its side, was the carriage that had been in front of ours. Behind our carriage, and at a drunken angle to it, was another carriage, which I later learned was coach H, which we had swept past during the crash. On the track in front of our carriage was a blackened and smoking section of the train\u2019s wheels. The locomotive was nowhere to be seen. The sirens had already started to sound as I walked up the bank. As I stood in the sunshine, none of it seemed real. I was working on an inquiry into a train crash, and now apparently I had been involved in one. But I could not see what we had crashed into. The diesel locomotive seemed to have vanished. The previous week, I had heard vivid evidence from those who had experienced the Southall crash at first hand. For a moment, I wondered whether all of this was actually happening, or whether I was in the middle of a macabre and complicated dream, brought on by weeks of work on the Southall crash Inquiry. I saw burned and blackened figures walking up and down the embankment. One man had terrible burns. The skin was hanging off his hands like a spider\u2019s web, his face was black and bloodied and his trousers were in tatters. I asked another man, whose face was also black and bleeding, and who was obviously in pain, whether he wanted to sit down. He said he didn\u2019t think so, because his back was terribly painful. Beside me, two women held each other and sobbed, their bodies shaking from top to toe. It was some minutes before the fire on coach H took hold. Soon, there was a vast column of black smoke rising hundreds of feet into the air from the coach, and I watched transfixed as it burned. I suspect we stayed at the trackside for 20-30 minutes. The police arrived and started to take charge, and to create some order out of the jumbled events beside the railway line. Eventually, an officer directed the uninjured and the walking wounded to a nearby school. Once there, I felt as useless as I had at the trackside, and tried not to get in the way. Some seriously injured passengers arrived. A woman was breathing through an oxygen mask. An elderly white-haired man was placed carefully on a blanket by some paramedics. Another woman had burns to her back, which were being bathed. I shall never forget the smell in that school: a mixture of oil, diesel and burned flesh. For days afterwards, when I thought about or relived the crash, I was able to summon back that same smell. * * * Many months later, I would hear the accounts of other survivors as they recounted their experience to Lord Cullen\u2019s public inquiry. Until 8.09am, it had been a mundane morning for Philip Scotcher. He boarded the train at Kemble, and sat in coach B near the back of the train. He felt and heard the crash. He described a sort of scary, eerie silence once the train had come to a complete stop. Then came a call from further towards the front of the coach. People began to panic, and Scotcher stood on his seat and shouted for everyone to calm down. He left through a door on the north side of the train and jumped to the ground. He looked immediately to his right, and saw the smoking remains of what had been the front carriage of the Thames train coming out of London, which had smashed into us. He saw a woman lying on the ground, with half of her body in a pool of flames. Her clothing and her hair were on fire. He dropped his bag and ran over to answer her screams for help. He grabbed her hand and dragged her back about 10 metres or so away from the fire. He found a tiny block of wood, about the size of his hand, and patted out the fire that was on her body. He left the woman in the care of the other man, returned to the burning Thames train, and grabbed a fire extinguisher. This soon ran out of water, and he threw it to one side. Scotcher looked into the inferno. He later described the scene to the inquiry: \u201cIt was then I saw another gentleman, and he was sort of sitting right in the middle of the fire and he was just horrifically burning. He was completely slumped over, and I heard him moan or make a noise, so I made a dash and put my hand round his waist and I remember saying to him: \u2018Please, please, you have to stand up. For both our sakes we have to walk out of here.\u2019 I could tell he was a very big gentleman and once he did stand up it was apparent he was very tall, I think he is actually 6ft 7in and good sort of 18-20 stone, so I could not physically carry him.\u201d \u201cWas he on fire?\u201d \u201cYes, he was.\u201d \u201cWhat did you do with him once you had taken hold of him?\u201d \u201cWell, we staggered back. I was then intending to take him towards the side of the track so that he could recover over there. We both then fell down.\u201d \u201cWas he still on fire?\u201d \u201cYes, slightly, but not as much. By falling down he extinguished quite a bit of the fire on himself. I was then able to put out the other fire that was on his legs and feet and I think some small amounts on his upper body.\u201d \u201cHow did you put that fire out?\u201d \u201cJust patted it very quickly with my hands. I then once again put my arm round him and said: \u2018Please, please, you\u2019re going to have to stand up. You\u2019re going to have to walk out of here.\u2019 All credit to him, he stood up and we walked the best we could.\u201d Once they got clear of the fire, Scotcher remained with the man, an American, Mike Adams, to comfort him, trying to make \u201cabsolute mindless chitchat about anything but the crash\u201d. He looked after Adams until, after what seemed like a lifetime, the emergency services arrived. Words do not exist adequately to describe what happened in coach H of the Great Western train. This was the carriage immediately behind the diesel locomotive, making it the front passenger carriage. Three men who were standing at the front of the coach died when they were propelled into the back of the locomotive. Two more, who were sitting in window seats at the very front of the coach were thrown out and died, and a sixth passenger, who hit her head and sustained injuries that were probably fatal, remained inside the carriage after it caught fire. Her body was found days later by the emergency services. Mercifully, it is almost certain that she was unconscious when the fire broke out, and would have known nothing of what happened. In simple terms, the coach was derailed to the south, slewed through almost 180 degrees, tilted to its side, and then caught fire. But that simple description does not begin to convey what actually happened in the coach. For there was not one fire, but two. The first was a fireball that passed inside the carriage, causing horrific injuries to a handful of the passengers. That was followed by thick black smoke, which made the carriage go dark. Chris Goodall, a passenger in Coach H, described to the inquiry what happened: \u201cI think other people have referred to the massive increase in temperature that took place within a few seconds. That is my observation as well. I do not believe, though, it was a result of fire inside the carriage at all close to me. I was aware at the time also of the air pressure, or the apparent air pressure inside the carriage falling, possibly as a result of the consumption of oxygen by the fire outside. So it was both very hot immediately and I had a strong sensation of fighting for breath very soon after the train had come to rest. So, at this stage, I felt that I was almost certainly going to be burned to death in the fire.\u201d Goodall escaped from the carriage, and then he turned around, intending to return to rescue any other passengers who might be trapped. As he did so, he caught sight of a man in the rear of what had been the power car. The man was trapped, and there were pools of fire on the ground around the power car. Goodall tried to free him, but very shortly afterwards, the man died. By now it was too late for him to help anyone else in coach H, as the carriage was engulfed in flames. * * * I had spent much of my career at the bar dealing with personal injury cases. Sprinkled among them were cases where the psychiatric or psychological consequences of an accident were more serious than any physical injuries. Eminent experts had devised diagnostic criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the first of which was exposure to a life-threatening event. Many individuals caught up in transport disasters had been compensated for PTSD developed as a result of their experiences. So I knew a fair amount about the effects of accidents upon the human mind. How would I react? Was I to be immune from the mental effects of involvement in the crash? I watched myself, as if with a third eye, and waited. Wednesday, the day after the crash, was full of relief. I had survived pretty well unscathed. The newspapers carried pictures of the carnage. If all the days had been like Wednesday, there would not have been much of a problem. But Wednesday became Thursday, and Thursday was, for me, the worst day. The beautiful weather of the previous two days had gone. At breakfast, the Times brought the sickening news that 28 people were now confirmed dead. It looked as if the death toll might rise to well over 100. The police apparently believed that the burnt out coach H might contain the remains of up to 70 people. I did not know that these figures would soon be shown to be dramatically overstated. Guilt at having done so little to help, and exhaustion, swept across me. I lay down on my bed, watching the light patter of rain on the roof light in the bedroom. I felt the tears starting and I did not try to stop them. Later that morning, standing in the kitchen having just read an affecting story about one of the dead train drivers, I again started to sob. Friday was another bad day, following another sleepless night. During the course of the morning, the police started to release the names of the dead, one of whom I knew, and had spoken to a minute or two before the crash as he made his way to the front of the train. I felt overwhelmed by it all, and had no idea how I could rise above it. I would try to concentrate on a conversation, but would find myself unable to do so. My mind would drift back to the sounds and the smells of the crash, ploughing through the ballast, leaving my seat to crouch in the aisle, shouting to the others in the carriage, watching the sad parade of the injured along the trackside. But as the days passed, and with the help of my loved ones, normality slowly returned. A month after the crash, I was asked whether I would be prepared to represent Great Western at the public inquiry into the Ladbroke Grove crash to be chaired by Lord Cullen, a senior Scottish judge who had already presided over inquiries into the Piper Alpha oil rig explosion and the Dunblane shootings. I needed time to consider. I was struggling to get over the crash, and the idea of reimmersing myself in it for months on end was unappealing. It also felt wrong to think of acting for a company involved in a crash I had been in, however blameless the company may have been. On the other hand, Jonathan Caplan QC, Great Western\u2019s leading counsel, was unavailable for the Ladbroke Grove inquiry, having already been booked to spend most of 2000 at a criminal trial in Hong Kong. If I declined, Great Western would have to find a new team of barristers, and I would have to find other work that was unlikely to be as interesting, as well-paid or as high-profile. In the end, the decision was more or less made for me. A few days later, the government announced that part of the Cullen Inquiry would be fused with the Southall Inquiry, and that Lord Cullen and Prof John Uff (the chair of the Southall inquiry) would sit as joint chairs of an inquiry to consider railway safety issues. Caplan felt I should agree to act if I could cope with it emotionally. So I said yes, and booked myself in for a further year of railway crash work. The first day of hearings was scheduled to be 10 May 2000. The usual van-load of documents arrived in my chambers in March, five months after the crash, and for the first time, I was able to understand what had happened aboard our train that morning. I started to read the experiences of others who had been in coaches in front of and behind mine. Reading the statements brought back the sounds and smells of the crash. All of the guilt I had felt as the numbers of supposed dead and injured had escalated in the days after the crash came back to me. What I had not appreciated until now was that passengers in all parts of our train except coach A had been in danger. Some had been unable to open doors. In one carriage, there had been a fair amount of panic. As I read these harrowing accounts, my stomach churned. I should not be doing this case. But it was too late to get out of it. I read, too, of the selflessness and heroism of many of the passengers. Other difficult questions nagged at my conscience. What had I been doing while all of this was going on? * * * In early April, Lord Cullen held the first of two meetings for the passengers to provide their input into the inquiry process. Only the passengers, not the lawyers, were permitted to speak. Since I was both, I could choose, but I had no desire to draw attention to myself and wanted to hear what others had to say. I sat at the back and kept silent. For the first time since the morning of the crash, I saw some of its consequences. I saw a woman wearing a transparent face mask being helped out of the meeting room. She looked to be in agonising pain. A youngish man who had been on the Thames train stood up to say something. He was wearing a black body corset and was obviously in pain. I knew many more by sight, both passengers and lawyers. Some of the reality of the horror of the crash, a horror I had largely escaped, seeped into me. Once again, I felt I should not be doing this case. I was too close to it and the memories were all too raw. I started to dread the first phase of the hearings, during which the passengers would tell Lord Cullen of what happened on that fateful morning. The hearings duly started on 10 May at the Methodist Central Hall, opposite Westminster Abbey, with a day-long opening statement by Robert Owen QC, counsel to the inquiry. He dealt in detail with the crash and the subsequent fire. I felt sick as he did so, and tried to concentrate upon staring at the computer screen in front of me and blotting out his words. I was fascinated and repelled in equal measure. He confirmed that the driver of our train, Brian Cooper, was in no way to blame for the accident. By the end of the first week of the evidence, I felt 10 years older. The inquiry heard the evidence from passengers on the Great Western train first, starting at the rear, in coach A, and moving steadily forwards. The witnesses from our train gave their evidence, in the main, without anger or rancour. The experience was still fresh for them, and often tears welled up in their eyes, or they had to stop to compose themselves before telling of the more horrendous aspects of their ordeal. For me, hearing the evidence of those who had been in the Thames train was like hearing about a different crash. I had not seen the Thames train at any stage, as we had been passing through the fireball when it would have been visible to me. Twenty-four of the 31 people who died had been travelling in the Thames train. Of these, all but one had been in the front carriage. Only six people from that carriage, which had been obliterated in the crash, had survived. One witness who had been trapped in the wreckage was a young Australian, Majella Lyons. She had been given a glimpse of hell: \u201cI just remember a big thump, a crash, and I was jolted up in my seat and then it became more intense. The whole time I kept thinking that we had perhaps hit something. I just assumed it was going to stop, it was going to stop, it was going to stop, but it just kept crashing. I was thrown up and down on my back and everything came in on top of me and I was cocooned under rubbish, under rubble. But there was a first impact which jolted me up and then the further impact which threw me down on to the floor, I assume, under seats and stuff.\u201d \u201cWas the train still moving?\u201d \u201cYes. As it was moving I could see things just smashing down on top of me, and I can remember seeing things coming toward me as I was flying and, as I landed, I just saw everything come in and it suddenly got very dark. There were two metal supports and I was just being jolted from side to side by those, but my legs from here down were completely pinned in. I could not see, but lots of rubble and chairs and things. So I was in a little cocoon held up by the two bars and stuff falling down.\u201d \u201cCould you hear other people?\u201d \u201cAt the time I think I heard someone say things like: \u2018Not again.\u2019 But then at the actual impact, that might have been after, but at the impact it was just a lot of noise and too much noise to hear people. But then when it stopped, there was this silence. It was everybody, I assume, just thinking, trying to understand, come to terms with what had happened. Then there was moaning, lots of moaning and screaming and calling out and lots of noise.\u201d \u201cWere you able to move?\u201d \u201cNo, I could not. My left leg, I could just move my toes, so I knew they were OK. My right foot I could actually bend up and down, but then both of those became numb. But I had the feeling that I could feel my feet, my toes and my fingers and I knew my arms and my torso were still there, so I knew I had not been cut in half and I was just so thankful \u2013 I could not believe that I was alive.\u201d \u201cWhat about your head?\u201d \u201cWell, my head was smashed right down on to the floor. Yes, I could move it a bit, yes.\u201d \u201cDid you think that you may have damaged your skull?\u201d \u201cYes. It was such a heavy force and I was lying down for hours and hours. I actually thought there was \u2013 in impact there was a big rush of hot fluids from the person on top of me, I presume it was blood, so I felt wet and hot, and my head was down and so it was covered in liquid and glass and stuff. A while later a light spilt in. They were trying to break through the side of the carriage. Eventually I saw some light to my left and they were telling me \u2013 I could hear their voices so I knew they were over there, so I put my hand through and they grabbed my hand. It was amazing. They just held my hand, tightening my hand, putting it in a drip and stuff. But first of all they passed through an oxygen mask.\u201d \u201cI think then someone was holding your hand for the three or four hours that it took to free you?\u201d \u201cYes, I had a few different people, I think. I am not sure. I had different people. There were ambulance and also fire brigade, and they were absolutely amazing. They were the most compassionate people and they were wonderful.\u201d * * * Day after day, the pieces of the jigsaw were slowly but steadily revealed and put into place. During the middle section of the inquiry, a series of Railtrack witnesses dealt with the history of the signalling system in the 0-2 mile area west of Paddington. It was a lamentable story, and revealed inertia and incompetence on a worrying scale. The immediate cause was straightforward enough. SN109 was the most notorious signal on that part of the railway network. It had only been installed a few years previously, but already it had been \u201cspadded\u201d \u2013 railway talk for a train going through a red light without stopping, \u201csignal passed at danger\u201d \u2013 on numerous occasions. Michael Hodder, driver of the Thames train, had driven through a red light at SN109, then carried on until his route took him on to the fast main line coming into London. But why? He was an inexperienced train driver, but he was an intelligent and level-headed man. Either he had not seen SN109 at all, or he must have thought that the signal allowed him to proceed. The construction of a new line to Heathrow airport in the early 1990s had required the erection of electrical equipment, and this was carried on overhead cables above the trains. Train drivers had to try to pick out the signal that governed the passage of their train through a maze of overhead electrical equipment, which they often described as being like spaghetti. SN109 was passed at red with worrying frequency. In October 1995, there was a crash at Royal Oak, near Paddington, and an inquiry was held to determine the causes. A Railtrack engineer submitted a report analysing the causes of the high number of spads in the Paddington area and suggesting 11 possible improvements. In the following years, committees were set up, talking shops opened, any number of suggestions were made and reports written, but, on the ground, virtually nothing happened to improve the situation. Railtrack was supposed to convene a signal sighting committee to investigate any signal that had been spadded more than once within a set timeframe. Six of the spads at SN109 should have resulted in the convening of a signal sighting committee. Not once did that happen. Thus when Hodder set off from platform nine on the morning of 5 October 1999, he was driving a route that was known to be very difficult for train drivers. He had qualified as a driver just 14 days before the crash. In various respects, his training had been inadequate. He had not been instructed directly about the risk of spadding at particular signals. He had not attended a spad awareness day. The tests he had taken to become a train driver had not included questions about the area between Paddington and Ladbroke Grove. None of this provided a full explanation for why he had not seen or reacted to the red signal. I have never had any doubt about the answer, even though the evidence from experts at the inquiry was equivocal. All my memories of the crash were drenched in the bright sunlight of that morning. It was cloudless, and the sun would have shone directly on to the east-facing signals that controlled Hodder\u2019s journey out of London. Anyone who has driven a car will have experienced the effect that sunlight can have on traffic lights, making it difficult or impossible to appreciate the colour that is actually illuminated. The more I thought about it, the more likely it seemed to me not only that Hodder had misread SN109 as yellow, but that he had also misread the signal before it, which also pointed east. He had accelerated through SN109, and continued driving for 700 metres, unaware of what he had done. Just seconds before the crash, as his route took him on to the main line, he would have seen the Great Western high-speed train bearing down upon him at a little over 80mph. He applied the emergency brake, but it was hopeless. For a moment, he may have looked at Brian Cooper sitting behind the controls of the Great Western train. Neither man would have believed what was happening as the two trains closed in on each other. Seconds later, both were dead. Hodder\u2019s fateful journey had taken a little under three and a half minutes. \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

The answer to that question, 99.99% of the time, is no,\u201d said Dr Samantha Montano, assistant professor of emergency management and disaster science at the University of Nebraska Omaha. \u201cThe way we think about preparedness is really kind of weird. When we talk about it day to day: do you have an emergency kit, yes or no?

      "bodyText": "On the afternoon of 17 October 1989, a 6.9-magnitude earthquake rocked the San Francisco Bay Area, killing 63 people and causing $13bn in damages as it toppled a chunk of the Bay Bridge, collapsed a section of freeway in Oakland, and crumbled thousands of buildings from San Francisco to Santa Cruz. Thirty years later, California will launch an earthquake early warning app, the first to cover the whole state, developed by UC Berkeley and the California Office of Emergency Services. The decades since the Loma Prieta quake have been remarkably quiet \u2013 yet it\u2019s not a matter of if, but when, the next large earthquake will rattle the Bay Area, and the consequences will undoubtedly be severe. There are multiple faults to worry about in the Bay: the infamous San Andreas is a system, with branches that run up the San Francisco peninsula, along the East Bay foothills through Oakland and Berkeley and further inland through Dublin and Walnut Creek. Just this week, a 4.5-magnitude quake with an epicenter in the Pleasant Hill area shook the region. In the case of a major earthquake, experts are particularly worried that \u201cground failures\u201d will cause widespread structural damage in many parts of the region built on landfill and sand. The California Geological Survey\u2019s most recent map of earthquake hazards shows huge swaths of the inner Bay Area are in \u201cliquefaction zones\u201d, meaning that during a major earthquake, the ground could be shaken so violently that it would very temporarily soften into jelly. \u201cPeople love to ask the question: is X place prepared for X disaster? Is California prepared for the next earthquake? The answer to that question, 99.99% of the time, is no,\u201d said Dr Samantha Montano, assistant professor of emergency management and disaster science at the University of Nebraska Omaha. \u201cThe way we think about preparedness is really kind of weird. When we talk about it day to day: do you have an emergency kit, yes or no? Just because you have that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re prepared for an earthquake \u2013 there\u2019s a lot more going into that.\u201d For any community facing a potential wide-scale disaster, the preparation is twofold: mitigating risk and preparing for the inevitable management of the emergency. While newer, stricter building codes put in place after Loma Prieta have required more quake-resilient construction, thousands of buildings in the Bay Area were built using old, shaky standards. Oakland passed an ordinance in 2019 requiring owners of vulnerable apartments to retrofit their structures. In San Francisco, where retrofits were due to be completed in 2018, about three-quarters of susceptible units have been quake-prepped. Politicians in Berkeley cited earthquake risk as one motivator for moving to ban natural gas hook-ups in new buildings earlier this year. \u201cWe have basically allowed ourselves to pump a toxic flammable greenhouse gas producing an expensive liquid into our homes across earthquake fault lines,\u201d the Berkeley city councilmember Kate Harrison said at the time. \u201cIt will seem crazy in 100 years. We can see that this is a dangerous situation.\u201d The East Bay had perhaps a little taste of that danger earlier this week: following the mid-sized East Bay quake, two of the area\u2019s five refineries shut down due to the \u201cupset\u201d and their built-up gasses flared. Later, on Tuesday, a NuStar energy fuel storage facility suffered an explosion and large fire, leading many to speculate the earthquake had triggered the accident. A spokesperson could not confirm the cause of the explosion, which some in the area said felt like yet another earthquake. \u201cWe want local governments to really be taking the lead and making sure not only that there\u2019s a plan for the city\u2019s government but also that they\u2019re integrating the plans with communities and businesses \u2013 particularly businesses like refineries, where there could be an added hazards,\u201d said Montano. Environmental justice activists in the East Bay city of Richmond cite this kind of risk in the bigger quakes to come. \u201cWhen the Hayward fault shifts, and we have that earthquake, the reality is, large portions of the Chevron refinery are built on landfill,\u201d said Andr\u00e9s Soto, an organizer with Communities for a Better Environment in Richmond. \u201cAnd despite the best assurances from Chevron about how they\u2019ve secured their refinery in the event of an earthquake, nature seems to have a way of conquering man-made structures.\u201d A transition away from the fossil fuels that in turn contribute to several other impending California environmental disasters could help make the Bay Area more resilient when the big one inevitably hits.",

      "body": "<p>Every year, the <a href=\"https://www.familymatters.org.au/\">Family Matters</a> campaign provide recommendations to Australian governments to tackle the issue of Indigenous overrepresentation in Australian child protection systems. Where I live in Victoria, the system is at crisis point.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/file_uploads/CCYP_-_Always_was__always_will_be_Koori_children_Systemic_Inquiry_report_October_2016_QZZbp4gC.pdf\">2014</a> when the then commissioner for Aboriginal Children and Young People, Andrew Jackomos, launched a systemic inquiry into Indigenous child protection, there were just over <a href=\"https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/child-protection/child-protection-australia-2013-14/data\">1,000</a> Indigenous children and young people in care. Now, five years later, the numbers are closer to <a href=\"https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/child-protection/child-protection-australia-2017-18/data\">3,000</a>. Indigenous overrepresentation in care is getting worse, not better.</p> <p>The fact of the matter is that Australian child protection systems are an industry that support thousands of jobs. Australians from various professions \u2013 lawyers, social workers, education specialists, medical professionals, psychologists \u2013 benefit financially from \u201cIndigenous disadvantage\u201d and overrepresentation in care.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2019/aug/08/its-not-because-we-dont-love-our-children-we-need-to-look-at-the-real-reason-aboriginal-children-are-placed-in-care\">It\u2019s not because we don\u2019t love our children \u2013 we need to look at the real reason Aboriginal children are placed in care | Raylene Harradine for IndigenousX</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I can\u2019t lie and pretend that I\u2019m not one of them. I am a Noongar <a href=\"https://www.findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/display/person99610\">researcher</a>, academic and social worker who has spent my career working with, and for, Indigenous children, families and communities in child protection systems. But I take comfort knowing that what I do is listen to Indigenous Australians experiencing the brunt of the suffering, trauma and hardship every day. I take their stories \u2013 their lived realities \u2013 to heart, and do my absolute best to try to give back and work towards changing a broken system that continues to fail them every day. I take on board the seriousness of the principles of Indigenous <a href=\"http://declaration.humanrights.gov.au/\">self-determination</a>, the paramount importance of listening \u2013 and acting on \u2013 what Indigenous people want for our kids.</p> <p>For the past four years, the Family Matters campaign has called on all Australian governments to increase prevention and early intervention support to Indigenous Australian families who are struggling to care for their kids. And while <a href=\"https://www.premier.vic.gov.au/more-support-for-aboriginal-kids-in-care/\">some</a> Australian governments have taken some recommendations on board, investment in out-of-home care supports \u2013 like foster care and kinship care \u2013 far exceed that provided to families before child removal occurs.</p> <p>The lopsided investment in tertiary child protection systems is staggering. A <a href=\"https://colab.telethonkids.org.au/investinchildren\">new report</a> shows the cost of child protection in Australia is just under $5.9bn annually, while only <a href=\"https://www.familymatters.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1097_F.M-2019_LR.%C6%92.pdf\">17%</a> of this expenditure goes to family support services. As articulated in the <a href=\"https://colab.telethonkids.org.au/investinchildren\">How Australia Can Invest in Children and Return More report</a>: \u201cThe cost to government of late intervention in Australia is $15.2bn each year. This equates to $607 for every Australian, or $1,912 per child and young person.\u201d</p> <p>Evidently, the cost of late intervention \u2013 that is, statutory services removing children from families when removal could have been prevented \u2013 hurts Australian taxpayers. Economically, it makes sense to intervene earlier and provide supports like in-home maternal child health nurse visits, subsided support to cover the rising cost of electricity bills, and culturally appropriate, affordable counselling services. It makes sense to tackle the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander overrepresentation crisis by preventing child removals in the first place.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The numbers of Indigenous children in out-of-home care now exceed the numbers removed throughout the stolen generations</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Indeed, poverty is associated with a higher likelihood of families \u2013 Indigenous and non-Indigenous \u2013 being involved with child protection systems.

      "bodyText": "Every year, the Family Matters campaign provide recommendations to Australian governments to tackle the issue of Indigenous overrepresentation in Australian child protection systems. Where I live in Victoria, the system is at crisis point. In 2014 when the then commissioner for Aboriginal Children and Young People, Andrew Jackomos, launched a systemic inquiry into Indigenous child protection, there were just over 1,000 Indigenous children and young people in care. Now, five years later, the numbers are closer to 3,000. Indigenous overrepresentation in care is getting worse, not better. The fact of the matter is that Australian child protection systems are an industry that support thousands of jobs. Australians from various professions \u2013 lawyers, social workers, education specialists, medical professionals, psychologists \u2013 benefit financially from \u201cIndigenous disadvantage\u201d and overrepresentation in care. I can\u2019t lie and pretend that I\u2019m not one of them. I am a Noongar researcher, academic and social worker who has spent my career working with, and for, Indigenous children, families and communities in child protection systems. But I take comfort knowing that what I do is listen to Indigenous Australians experiencing the brunt of the suffering, trauma and hardship every day. I take their stories \u2013 their lived realities \u2013 to heart, and do my absolute best to try to give back and work towards changing a broken system that continues to fail them every day. I take on board the seriousness of the principles of Indigenous self-determination, the paramount importance of listening \u2013 and acting on \u2013 what Indigenous people want for our kids. For the past four years, the Family Matters campaign has called on all Australian governments to increase prevention and early intervention support to Indigenous Australian families who are struggling to care for their kids. And while some Australian governments have taken some recommendations on board, investment in out-of-home care supports \u2013 like foster care and kinship care \u2013 far exceed that provided to families before child removal occurs. The lopsided investment in tertiary child protection systems is staggering. A new report shows the cost of child protection in Australia is just under $5.9bn annually, while only 17% of this expenditure goes to family support services. As articulated in the How Australia Can Invest in Children and Return More report: \u201cThe cost to government of late intervention in Australia is $15.2bn each year. This equates to $607 for every Australian, or $1,912 per child and young person.\u201d Evidently, the cost of late intervention \u2013 that is, statutory services removing children from families when removal could have been prevented \u2013 hurts Australian taxpayers. Economically, it makes sense to intervene earlier and provide supports like in-home maternal child health nurse visits, subsided support to cover the rising cost of electricity bills, and culturally appropriate, affordable counselling services. It makes sense to tackle the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander overrepresentation crisis by preventing child removals in the first place. Indeed, poverty is associated with a higher likelihood of families \u2013 Indigenous and non-Indigenous \u2013 being involved with child protection systems. Child protection reports increase by remoteness and the poorer the socioeconomic area. Family violence, parental substance abuse, mental health issues and homelessness are also associated with a higher likelihood of Indigenous children and families encountering child protection. But all of these reasons for Indigenous child removal stem, in no small measure, from Australia\u2019s colonial legacy. Invasion continues to have a direct impact on the lives of Indigenous people, and financially, Australian taxpayers are bankrolling the cost of failing to intervene early enough to heal intergenerational trauma. The national Indigenous-led and controlled Family Matters campaign continues to advocate for increased prevention and early intervention supports to keep families together and reduce overrepresentation. As the quantitative analysis of Australian child protection data provide a strong indication that overrepresentation will continue to worsen, I have to ask myself why the Family Matters recommendations are not being more readily adopted by all Australian governments. I think about the notion that we\u2019re in the midst of a second stolen generations. Nationally, 20,421 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children were living in out-of-home care at 30 June 2018, a rate 10.2 times higher than non-Indigenous children. The numbers of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in out-of-home care now exceed the numbers removed throughout the stolen generations. But then I wonder if the stolen generations never ended, but instead, just morphed into child protection. Many contemporary Indigenous child removals are unwanted, many are legitimated by state-sanctioned power \u2013 such as police jurisdiction and court orders \u2013 as was the case during the stolen generations. And in another striking parallel, Indigenous children today are still removed for their \u201cbest interests\u201d, the same language that was used to justify forcible removals in the 20th century. The similarities between past and contemporary Indigenous child removal practices raises a host of questions. On whose values do we determine the \u201cbest interests\u201d of the Indigenous child? Are we still trying to assimilate Indigenous children into non-Indigenous society? Why aren\u2019t we listening \u2013 and acting on \u2013 the demands of Indigenous Australians who continue to articulate Indigenous-led solutions to the overrepresentation crisis? In 2008, the then Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd apologised for the actions of successive Australian governments in forcibly removing Indigenous children from their families, communities and cultures as part of the stolen generations. A hundred years from now, will we look back on contemporary Indigenous child removals and again, apologise for the actions \u2013 and inactions \u2013 of Australian governments to reduce Indigenous child removals? One thing is for certain: saying sorry means you don\u2019t do it again. Let\u2019s not repeat the mistakes of the past. Let\u2019s start listening to \u2013 and acting on \u2013 the solutions proposed by Indigenous Australians to reduce overrepresentation. \u2022 Jacynta Krakouer is a Noongar woman who is an associate lecturer for the department of social work at the Melbourne School of Health Sciences \u2022 Read The Family Matters Report 2019",

Members share photography from retro cookbooks (like this picture of a <a href=\"https://scontent.fyvr1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/72792070_10219876874094987_8037107266610003968_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&amp;_nc_oc=AQmu3Na4Iy1JER2a51wMBoeNV46F5imojEqxEvdv5DLkjspDwcoLXB60n0fs0Adwv6wx4OdtLxhKACuzHqFjg_uz&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fyvr1-1.fna&amp;oh=a07577575f22e66e9af047e48bb83472&amp;oe=5E16F068\">mutilated sea bass</a> reconstructed with a conga line of gelatin-ensconced shrimp on its back) or jiggle videos of various jellies being <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOwsC7xUo7s\">spanked</a> with spoons (those are my favorite).</p> <p>Some of it is appetizing, much of it is emphatically not, but all of it qualifies as \u201coddly satisfying\u201d, a category of web content that emerged from Reddit in 2013 and encapsulates a variety of quotidian-yet-hypnotic stuff \u2013 like watching people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/feb/04/soap-cutting-trend-quick-guide\">cut soap</a> or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK0v1OafTXE\">squeeze slime</a>.</p> <p>The question of why some people find wobbly Jell-O so appealing is subjective. According to a Facebook post by my fellow group member, University of the Pacific food historian Ken Albala, gelatin\u2019s allure lies in:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cThe irresistible jiggle, threatening collapse with every twist and turn. The thrill of the spoon smoothly cleaving its slick glossy flesh. Then in the mouth, that bounce, the subtle firmness that first resists then gently yields to the pressure of the teeth.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>But that\u2019s just one guy\u2019s opinion. For the rest of us, wiggle videos may provide anxiety-reducing ASMR. Philosopher Evan Malone has even <a href=\"https://contempaesthetics.org/newvolume/pages/article.php?articleID=800\">made a case</a> for the phenomenon of \u201codd satisfaction\u201d being a product of the grace of witnessing a \u201cperfect fit\u201d.</p> <p>What is clear is that jelly\u2019s charms are catching on: lately, the worlds of fashion and art have also been ready for some jelly.</p> <p>To wit: for SS20, Balenciaga showed <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B2_fpXJlLCI/\">three gowns</a>, domed like gelatin molds and bouncing with their wearer\u2019s every step. At Alexander McQueen, Kaia Gerber, her face gleaming with highlighter, wore a <a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/editorial/image-editorial/alexander-mcqueen-show-runway-spring-summer-2020-paris-fashion-week-france-30-sep-2019-10430572c\">petal-like confection</a> evocative of the flowers fluted into <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWcO27wDzeo\">3D jelly cakes</a> (artistic desserts popular in Mexico and Vietnam). At Issey Miyake, dresses horizontally striped with juicy colors descended from the ceiling, pouring over models who <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B268nprHQE4/\">jiggled joyfully inside them</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\".\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

      "bodyText": "For a year now, I\u2019ve been a member of a Facebook group for \u2026 gelatin enthusiasts. Called, amazingly, Show Me Your Aspics (get it?), it\u2019s a haven for about 30,000 fans of fluctuant foodstuffs, often referred to by the brand name \u201cJell-O\u201d in the US and \u201cjelly\u201d in the UK. Members share photography from retro cookbooks (like this picture of a mutilated sea bass reconstructed with a conga line of gelatin-ensconced shrimp on its back) or jiggle videos of various jellies being spanked with spoons (those are my favorite). Some of it is appetizing, much of it is emphatically not, but all of it qualifies as \u201coddly satisfying\u201d, a category of web content that emerged from Reddit in 2013 and encapsulates a variety of quotidian-yet-hypnotic stuff \u2013 like watching people cut soap or squeeze slime. The question of why some people find wobbly Jell-O so appealing is subjective. According to a Facebook post by my fellow group member, University of the Pacific food historian Ken Albala, gelatin\u2019s allure lies in: \u201cThe irresistible jiggle, threatening collapse with every twist and turn. The thrill of the spoon smoothly cleaving its slick glossy flesh. Then in the mouth, that bounce, the subtle firmness that first resists then gently yields to the pressure of the teeth.\u201d But that\u2019s just one guy\u2019s opinion. For the rest of us, wiggle videos may provide anxiety-reducing ASMR. Philosopher Evan Malone has even made a case for the phenomenon of \u201codd satisfaction\u201d being a product of the grace of witnessing a \u201cperfect fit\u201d. What is clear is that jelly\u2019s charms are catching on: lately, the worlds of fashion and art have also been ready for some jelly. To wit: for SS20, Balenciaga showed three gowns, domed like gelatin molds and bouncing with their wearer\u2019s every step. At Alexander McQueen, Kaia Gerber, her face gleaming with highlighter, wore a petal-like confection evocative of the flowers fluted into 3D jelly cakes (artistic desserts popular in Mexico and Vietnam). At Issey Miyake, dresses horizontally striped with juicy colors descended from the ceiling, pouring over models who jiggled joyfully inside them. Then there is the contemporary Irish designer Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Dwyer, who molds silicone directly on her models, creating vividly colored garments flaunting the suggestive visual metaphor between jelly and flesh. Gelatin is also relevant to the art world, where its moldability makes it a useful medium for experimentation. Since 2007, culinary artists Bompas &amp; Parr have been crafting jelly architecture, like a zesty orange version of Buckingham Palace. Their work also inspired photographer Jenny van Sommers to create her mesmerizing The Jelly Film, in which four jellies express their personalities through dance (just watch it). More recently, as observed in the New York Times Magazine, queer and female artists have drawn upon gelatin\u2019s fleshy sensuality, camp appeal and associations with feminine domesticity to inform their work. Artist Alison Kuo (another Show Me Your Aspics member) engaged \u201cnotions of sacrifice\u201d by manhandling Jell-O in a live performance piece in Manhattan early this year. Artist duo Lazy Mom and photographer Joseph Maida both use gelatin in their jolie laide subversions of Instagram aesthetics. Sharona Franklin, a disabled artist whose sculptures recall her reliance on transgenic medicine, creates found object-filled jellies so eccentrically chic that this week, fashion copycat watchdog Diet Prada posted allegations that Gucci plagiarized her. Yet what if you cannot reconcile jelly\u2019s growing appeal with its slaughterhouse origins, and are distressed that the worldwide gelatin industry itself is on the rise \u2013 estimated to be worth $4bn by 2024? In that case, consider casting your lot in not with art but science. Synthetic biology startup Geltor aims to have the first lab-grown vegan gelatin to market in 2020.

      "bodyText": "Antonella Lampone will never forget that night. Thunder and lightning shook the skies as thick and grey clouds seemed to give back to Sicily all the water it had not received that entire summer. A few metres from her small apartment in the Oratory of Saint Lawrence in Palermo, where her mother was a housekeeper, one of the most notorious art thefts in history was taking place, as a Caravaggio that had hung for more than three centuries above the altar was cut out of its frame. Fifty years have passed since 17 October 1969, but Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio\u2019s Nativity with St Francis and St Lawrence remains one of the world\u2019s most sought-after works of stolen art. Lampone was 15 at the time and living with her mother, Maria Gelfo, and her aunt in the church. \u201cMy mother and aunt were the first to arrive on the scene,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were wailing and screaming. \u201cI fell out of my bed and ran to the altar of the church where the painting was hanging and that now was missing. We spent the next days mourning over that loss. They hadn\u2019t stolen a painting; they had kidnapped a member of my family.\u201d Back then in Palermo, only one organisation had the power to steal such a treasure: the Sicilian mafia. In a video interview filmed in 2001 but locked in a drawer and revealed last month exclusively to the Guardian, the parish priest of the oratory, Benedetto Rocco, said the painting was in the home of a powerful mafia boss who had sliced off a piece of the canvas in order to convince the Catholic church to come to the negotiating table for its return, contacting him twice by letter. Lampone has confirmed Rocco\u2019s statements. \u201cI recall that the parish priest told my mother that he had been contacted by the thieves to make a deal,\u201d she said. According to Rocco, the painting was in the home of the mafia boss Gaetano Badalamenti, who at the time was one of the most powerful mobsters in Sicily, running a $1.65bn (\u00a31.3bn) heroin trafficking network to the US. Rocco informed the police of the letters and the piece of canvas, but the files of his statements seem to have vanished. A month ago, Sicilian investigators questioned Lampone. \u201cI asked the police whether my mother\u2019s formal statements were still in the police archives. She had been questioned dozens of times, but I was told that her files had disappeared,\u201d she said. Investigators are racing against time. Many suspects and witnesses of the crime are deceased, including Badalamenti, who died in 2004, and Rocco, who died in 2013. Lampone\u2019s mother passed away two years after the theft. In the weeks preceding it, Lampone recalls her mother requesting greater security for a window in the church after several suspicious individuals had asked her to let them in so they could admire the painting. \u201cMy mother was alerted, and she asked the Vatican Curia to secure a window in the oratory that was accessible from the street where the Caravaggio was displayed. But the Curia said that there was no need follow through,\u201d she said. It was precisely from that window that the thieves entered the church on a rainy night 50 years ago. Hopes of solving the mystery behind the Nativity were reignited in June last year after Italian investigators announced Gaetano Grado, a mafia informant, said Badalamenti had been put in touch with an art dealer in Switzerland. Prosecutors are now looking to Switzerland, where new witnesses might hold the ultimate secret of one of the greatest mysteries in art history. The foremost question is whether the painting is in a good condition, even if the evidence strongly suggests otherwise. In 1989, another mafia informant named Francesco \u201cMozzarella\u201d Marino Mannoia revealed to the magistrate Giovanni Falcone that he had stolen the Caravaggio, rolling up the canvas to smuggle it out of the church. Lampone recalls a rug was also stolen that night, which was likely used by the thieves to roll up the canvas and protect it from the rain. \u201cThat decision proved fatal,\u201d said Maurizio Ortolan, a police officer who was present during Mannoia\u2019s interrogation, since paint, hardened over centuries, easily cracks. \u201cMannoia said that when they opened the canvas, the paint had partially disintegrated.\u201d Michele Cuppone, an expert on the missing Caravaggio, said: \u201cRolling up from the inside a canvas from the 1600s is one of the worst mistakes one can make. \u201cThere have been other cases of stolen paintings that had been rolled up.

The independent senator, a former soldier in the Australian defence force and a fierce advocate for veterans, has the casting vote on the controversial legislation which is opposed by medical practitioners and human rights groups. On Thursday the home affairs minister said he had put a \u201ccompelling case\u201d to Lambie on the bill but noted she wanted to wait for a Senate inquiry report due on Friday before deciding her vote. \u201cShe\u2019s made her cause that of veterans \u2026 I think in a way she looks through the lens of what would a veteran think or what would a veteran want me to do in relation to these matters,\u201d Dutton told 2GB Radio. \u201cI believe very strongly that most Australians and certainly the vast majority of veterans would want us to abolish this law.\u201d Dutton did not cite a source for the claim. The medevac provisions \u2013 passed in the last parliament by Labor, the Greens and independents \u2013 gives clinicians a greater say in the medical transfers of asylum seekers by creating a specialist medical panel to approve transfers under advice from doctors rather than government officials. On Sunday Lambie said she would not be trading her vote or doing \u201cdeals\u201d over the Coalition bill to repeal the provisions.

The medevac inquiry is being conducted by the Senate legal and constitutional affairs legislation committee, which is chaired by Liberal senator Amanda Stoker. Of a total of 84 individuals and groups who made submissions to the inquiry only the home affairs department supported the government bill to repeal medevac provisions. The inquiry has heard from doctors responsible for health assessments that of 581 people in detention they have audited 97% have significant physical health issues and 91% have serious mental health issues. The Australian Human Rights Commission has submitted that of the 536 people brought to Australia in 2018-19 approximately 60% were transferred due to actual or prospective litigation, arguing the previous regime was not sufficient to ensure proper care.

The phenomenon of thundersnow could strike alpine regions of Victoria this week, while rural Queensland swelters through 40C days. According to the bureau of meteorology, a cold front is sweeping across southern Australian, including Tasmania, Victoria and southern New South Wales, at the same time as hot air lingers over Queensland and northern NSW, producing the extreme variation. In Queensland, Cloncurry is forecast to hit a maximum of 39C on Thursday, with Longreach forecast for 40C and Julia Creek 41C. Total fire bans have also been declared for Queensland and large parts of northern NSW. In Victoria, Mount Baw Baw will experience minimums of -2C from Friday to Sunday. Combined with bad weather, this could lead to the combination of thunderstorms and snow, known as thundersnow. Katarina Kovacevic, a meteorologist from the bureau, said this was not uncommon. \u201cExpect snow over the ski fields and the alpine regions,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is pretty typical for this time of year and snow in October is not uncommon.\u201d \u201cWe saw some storms over north-east Victoria, over the elevated peaks. A line of storms moved through a couple of hours ago. There is a chance we could see some storms continuing this afternoon, and because the air mass is so cold, if a storm were to develop, any precipitation that would form would probably land on the ground as snow.\u201d Thundersnow had also occurred in August, when a cold front swept across Victoria, South Australia and NSW. Kovacevic said the twin hot and cold spells were not out of the ordinary. \u201cThe temperatures over the north of country are being caused by a pool of hot air, which is kind of typical for this time of year, particularly over northern parts of Western Australia. \u201cWe have a cold front moving through north-east NSW and south-east Queensland and that is helping to draw the hotter conditions further east. Especially over the inland areas, where it doesn\u2019t have the moderating influence of the sea. \u201cOver the southern part, over Victoria and southern NSW, we\u2019ve seen a cold front \u2026That is not uncommon for spring. Spring is a very changeable time of year.\u201d On Thursday, Brisbane was forecast for a maximum of 33C, compared with a high of 15C in Melbourne and 16C in Hobart. That disparity is poised to widen, with both Melbourne and Hobart forecast for a minimum of 7C on Friday. In NSW, Sydney was set for a maximum of 28C on Thursday, with even hotter conditions inland. The bureau predicted 33C in Bellingen and 29C in Cessnock. On Wednesday, the NSW Rural Fire Service confirmed that 64 homes had been destroyed in bushfires last week.",

      "bodyText": "The Australian Border Force transferred a seriously mentally ill man to Perth from Melbourne, where a youth mental health facility was preparing to treat him \u2013 then took almost a month to bring him back. On Tuesday, after being flown 2,700km across the country, admitted to hospital emergency or psychiatric departments six times, held in various forms of detention, then flying another 2,700km, the young man was finally taken to the facility that had originally offered to treat him. The shock early-morning transfer from the Melbourne detention centre, Mita, to Perth, was on a commercial Qantas flight \u2013 just one day after the Qantas chief executive, Alan Joyce, proclaimed that the company would not be silent on social issues. The young asylum seeker was removed from the Melbourne detention centre in the early hours of 19 September, allegedly without warning and without consulting the external health professionals who were arranging to have him readmitted to the Melbourne facility. No reason for the transfer was given, as far as Guardian Australia is aware. Guardian Australia understands that a bed had been made available before he was taken to Melbourne airport under guard and put on the Qantas flight. Friends and visitors had expressed serious concern for his mental health while inside Mita, citing apparent psychosis, with a longtime visitor describing him as one of the most ill young men she had come across in detention. After he was transferred to Perth he was sent to the Yongah Hill detention centre but then admitted to various WA hospitals six times. In at least one of those instances, he was discharged by doctors who said they could not help him and he needed to return to Melbourne to receive the care arranged for him there. Instead, he was returned to detention. After more than three weeks in WA he was eventually flown back to Melbourne, but it took several days for him to be readmitted to the mental health facility. Guardian Australia was told he had called out \u201cI am being forcibly removed\u201d as he was put on the Qantas flight. It is understood that detention health staff would have had to clear him to fly, but the extent of that assessment and whether his mental health formed part of it is unclear. The man\u2019s transfer came less than 24 hours after Joyce told the National Press Club in Canberra that \u201cgood companies\u201d would intervene on social and economic issues. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to pull back on what we say on social issues because that\u2019s important to our employees, our customers, our shareholders,\u201d he said. Despite repeated requests, Qantas declined to comment either on the circumstances of the flight or whether it contradicted Joyce\u2019s statement. After publication of this story, a spokesman said: \u201cThese are very complex and emotive matters but it\u2019s not for airlines to adjudicate on who should and shouldn\u2019t get to stay in Australia after the government and courts have made their decisions.\u201d Qantas and Virgin are among a number of international airlines that have been the target of global campaigns calling for them to end their involvement with deportations and immigration detention transfers. The Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, which holds shares in Qantas, has had numerous meetings with the company seeking policy changes. At the 2018 Qantas AGM, company chairman Leigh Clifford said they didn\u2019t believe the ACCR\u2019s campaign was really about Qantas, but was instead \u201cabout finding different ways to put pressure on the Australian Government and the Federal Opposition to change their immigration policy\u201d. The home affairs department has been criticised for its policy of transferring detainees from centre to centre, away from family, support networks and medical care. Transfers occur frequently, in part to manage the balance of different cohorts across centres with varying levels of security. In June the Australian Human Rights Commission found that transfers between centres often occurred without notice. While there could be exceptional circumstances warranting sudden transfers, they did not appear to be justified in all cases and detainees often felt they were being punished, the commission said. Sister Brigid Arthur, cofounder of the Brigidine Asylum Seekers Project, said the transfers were often both \u201carbitrary and inexplicable\u201d. \u201cI think there\u2019s a level of cruelty in this,\u201d she said. \u201cThe arbitrary nature of it strikes fear into most of the detainees because they never know when they\u2019re going to be moved. It\u2019s always without warning and usually in the middle of the night or very early morning. \u201cSo one has to ask, is it a measure to extract compliance from people so they\u2019re too frightened to raise issues or in any way rock the boat? If it is, then that\u2019s immoral. It\u2019s a blight on our democracy.\u201d The Australian Border Force declined to comment on individual cases but a spokesman said transfers of detainees across the detention network were \u201cindividually assessed and measures are put in place to ensure the safety of the detainee, staff and contractors, and the public\u201d. The ABF spokesman said placement decisions were \u201cpart of a process of assessing and managing risk\u201d, medical needs were given priority when making those decisions, and family and community links were \u201ccarefully considered\u201d. Arthur said while some transfers brought detainees closer to where their families lived, many did the opposite, and the separations had a \u201cdevastating impact\u201d on transferees and their families. \u201cThere are some cases where people are quite ill and often mentally ill, and are moved to a place where there are fewer mental health facilities or less potential for getting treatment, and in other cases people have family and connections in a place and they\u2019re moved to places where they don\u2019t have any,\u201d she said. Observers have noted the similarity between the young man\u2019s circumstances and those of Sarwan Aljhelie, who took his own life at Yongah Hill just over a year ago. Aljhelie, whose death sparked riots at the centre, had been transferred without warning from Villawood detention centre in Sydney, near where his parents and three children lived, and less than a month after his third suicide attempt. \u2022 Crisis support services can be reached 24 hours a day: Lifeline 13 11 14; Suicide Call Back Service 1300 659 467; Kids Helpline 1800 55 1800; MensLine Australia 1300 78 99 78",

A study in <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26026343\">2015</a> found that even quite low intakes of caffeine were associated with increased risks of miscarriage, although the increase in risk was small.

There are already more than a dozen individual studies looking at this topic, so the addition of a relatively small paper that hasn\u2019t even been published yet probably won\u2019t change the recommendations. In many ways this is more about how public health works than anything \u2013 we identify the ideal scenario, but make recommendations based on real life. In an ideal world, pregnant women probably wouldn\u2019t do anything even remotely unsafe, but we live in the real world where pregnant people are people and shouldn\u2019t be locked in a cage of guilt for nine months. Drinking absolutely no coffee might be the safest option, but the harms, if any, from drinking a cup or two a day seem to be extremely minimal. If you\u2019re stressed about caffeine and pregnancy, the best advice is to talk to your doctor. They are by far the best equipped to give you advice on how to manage your way through the mammoth experience of making a human being. And don\u2019t worry too much about the headlines. The reality is usually not nearly as scary as the stories make it seem. \u2022 Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz is an epidemiologist working in chronic disease",

The players, who have not been named, allegedly shoved a male employee at Bacon Egg nightclub in the southwestern city of Kumamoto during an alcohol-fuelled night out with teammates and team staff, according to Japanese media. The players also allegedly spilled drinks on DJ equipment, punched walls and mirrors and tore apart a stuffed bear, Kyodo reported. The club was packed with about 200 people when the alleged assault took place in the early hours of Monday morning, the news agency added. Police questioned the players over the incident, which occurred hours after Uruguay\u2019s 35-13 defeat to Wales in their final pool D match. The club\u2019s owners were reported to have said they are considering filing a criminal complaint. Security camera footage shows the employee being pushed to the ground before an unidentified man steps forward to help him to his feet. Bacon Egg noted on its Twitter account that two Uruguayan players had displayed \u201cdisappointing behaviour\u201d at the club. The players have reportedly expressed remorse over their actions, according to the tournament\u2019s organising committee. \u201cEven if it happened in their private time, their behaviour is regrettable. As the organising committee of the host country, we hope to address it in good faith,\u201d Kyodo quoted a committee official as saying. The alleged assault contrasts with the impeccable behaviour displayed by other rugby teams in Japan. Canadian players won praise on social media for helping clean up host city Kamaishi after it was struck by a powerful typhoon last weekend. Typhoon Hagibis, which killed more then 70 people and caused widespread flooding, forced the cancellation of Canada\u2019s final pool match, against Namibia, on Sunday. Photographs and video clips appeared of more than a dozen players and team officials shoveling mud into sandbags, carrying furniture and clearing debris in the north-eastern coastal city, which had been selected to host two World Cup matches to spur its recovery from the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami.",

</figure>  <p>Carers and experts believe the cause is the prolonged dry conditions in eastern Australia, which has reduced the availability of food sources such as tree blossom.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2019/oct/17/stripped-bare-australias-hidden-climate-crisis\">Land clearing</a> and development in flying-fox habitat also reduces the availability of food, but the pattern of prolonged warm and dry weather, as well as recent bushfires, has exacerbated the situation.</p> <p>Tania Bishop, a wildlife veterinarian based in Queensland who has worked with flying foxes for 20 years, said the impact of dry winds and low humidity on the animals had led to what vets and carers were calling a \u201cstarvation event\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t ever seen the degree of emaciation and animals in as bad condition as I have this year,\u201d Bishop said.</p> <p>\u201cThe most shocking picture I\u2019ve taken away from the last couple of weeks is a lot of animals that have come in looking like they\u2019ve been mummified, that\u2019s how dehydrated they were.\u201d</p> <p>Bishop said carers were taking in a disproportionate number of female flying foxes of breeding age during what would normally have been breeding season.</p> <p>\u201cThey should be well and truly into their pregnancy by now and they\u2019re either not pregnant or they come in so thin they ultimately lose their babies,\u201d she said.</p> <p>She said the baby animals that had been born were incredibly underweight.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image

Australian head of programs for Humane Society International, said carers and vets working on the ground to assist the flying foxes would need support.</p> <p>\u201cWith so many animals in need of care already and a high likelihood that heat-stress events will hit bats again this summer, it\u2019s imperative that authorities roll out all the support they can for volunteer wildlife carers bearing the brunt of this crisis,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Queensland Department of Environment and Science said the total impact on flying-fox populations was difficult to estimate accurately, but it was being closely monitored by the department, the CSIRO, local governments and wildlife carers.</p> <p>He said the government strongly advised members of the public not to touch flying foxes, even if they appeared to be dead, as it was easy to be bitten or scratched when trying to help or move the animals.</p> <p>\u201cA small portion of flying-foxes carry a virus (the Australian bat lyssavirus) which can be transmitted to humans through contact with saliva \u2026 from the animals,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p>

      "bodyText": "Flying foxes, including threatened species, have been dying or taken into care in large numbers due to a food shortage in their habitat in eastern Australia. Authorities in Queensland and New South Wales say there have been increased reports since September of sick and dead flying-foxes in an area stretching from northern NSW up to Gladstone in Queensland. Many of the animals found on the ground have been highly emaciated and dehydrated. Queensland\u2019s Department of Environment and Science said flying foxes in trees had been exhibiting behaviours consistent with malnourishment, such as remaining in food trees instead of returning to their normal roost areas during the day. The two main species affected are the grey-headed flying fox \u2013 a threatened species listed as vulnerable under Australian environment laws \u2013 and the black flying fox. Carers and experts believe the cause is the prolonged dry conditions in eastern Australia, which has reduced the availability of food sources such as tree blossom. Land clearing and development in flying-fox habitat also reduces the availability of food, but the pattern of prolonged warm and dry weather, as well as recent bushfires, has exacerbated the situation. Tania Bishop, a wildlife veterinarian based in Queensland who has worked with flying foxes for 20 years, said the impact of dry winds and low humidity on the animals had led to what vets and carers were calling a \u201cstarvation event\u201d. \u201cI haven\u2019t ever seen the degree of emaciation and animals in as bad condition as I have this year,\u201d Bishop said. \u201cThe most shocking picture I\u2019ve taken away from the last couple of weeks is a lot of animals that have come in looking like they\u2019ve been mummified, that\u2019s how dehydrated they were.\u201d Bishop said carers were taking in a disproportionate number of female flying foxes of breeding age during what would normally have been breeding season. \u201cThey should be well and truly into their pregnancy by now and they\u2019re either not pregnant or they come in so thin they ultimately lose their babies,\u201d she said. She said the baby animals that had been born were incredibly underweight. \u201cThe very frightening thing about the grey-headed flying fox being affected is that their status is already threatened,\u201d she said. \u201cThe concern is what has this done to the already vulnerable status of the species?\u201d Evan Quartermain, the Australian head of programs for Humane Society International, said carers and vets working on the ground to assist the flying foxes would need support. \u201cWith so many animals in need of care already and a high likelihood that heat-stress events will hit bats again this summer, it\u2019s imperative that authorities roll out all the support they can for volunteer wildlife carers bearing the brunt of this crisis,\u201d he said. A spokesman for the Queensland Department of Environment and Science said the total impact on flying-fox populations was difficult to estimate accurately, but it was being closely monitored by the department, the CSIRO, local governments and wildlife carers. He said the government strongly advised members of the public not to touch flying foxes, even if they appeared to be dead, as it was easy to be bitten or scratched when trying to help or move the animals. \u201cA small portion of flying-foxes carry a virus (the Australian bat lyssavirus) which can be transmitted to humans through contact with saliva \u2026 from the animals,\u201d he said. The spokesman said anyone who spots a sick or injured flying fox should call the RSPCA on 1300 ANIMAL (1300 264 625) to report it and a vaccinated carer will be contacted to rescue and care for the animal. A spokeswoman for the NSW Department of Planning, Industry and Environment said there had been reports of animals roosting in residential areas rather than returning to their usual camps. \u201cThroughout October there have been reports of malnourished and dead flying foxes in south-eastern Queensland and northern NSW. This is occurring as a result of a food shortage, which is attributed to unfavourable weather conditions impacting the availability of nectar,\u201d she said.",

      "bodyText": "No assault charges will be laid against the prime minister of Fiji in relation to an incident with an opposition MP outside parliament, despite there being \u201csufficient evidence for the matter to proceed to court,\u201d the country\u2019s department of public prosecutions has ruled. Frank Bainimarama was accused of assault by Pio Tikoduadua, an opposition MP for the National Federation Party, who alleges the prime minister grabbed and shoved him outside Fiji\u2019s parliament in Suva, causing his glasses to fall to the ground and break. The incident was captured on video and the footage was widely shared online. It shows Bainimarama grabbing the lapel of Tikoduadua\u2019s coat and giving him a light push before the men were involved in what appeared to be a heated exchange while security guards looked on. Bainimarama told the Guardian in the weeks following the incident that Tikoduadua had insulted Bainimarama\u2019s family during a parliamentary debate. The Fijian department of public prosecutions issued a statement saying that while there was enough evidence for the case to go to court, they would not lay charges against Bainimarama because the incident had already been dealt with by the parliamentary privileges committee and to pursue criminal charges \u201cwould, in effect, be subjecting the prime minister to double jeopardy\u201d. \u201cHad the matter not been heard by the privileges committee and dealt with by Parliament, there was sufficient evidence for the matter to proceed to court,\u201d said Christopher Pryde, the director of public prosecutions. In September, a report to the parliamentary privileges committee recommended Tikoduadua apologise to Bainimarama for what it described as a personal attack on the prime minister. Tikoduadua refused and walked out of parliament in protest, leading to his suspension for six months without salary. Tikoduadua later tweeted: \u201cIf I am to choose between my seat and my dignity, I\u2019d rather lose my seat.\u201d The parliamentary privileges committee cleared Bainimarama of physical assault, but recommended he apologise to Tikoduadua for verbally assaulting him, which he did. The two parliamentary staffers who filmed the incident say they were forced to resign last month over allegations that they had breached parliamentary neutrality rules by leaking the video. Bainimarama came to power in 2006 in a military coup and was widely criticised for refusing to call elections for eight years. He has since won two elections \u2013 in 2014 and 2018.

Clements told an Icac inquiry recently that Murnain <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-10-09/icac-told-nsw-labor-boss-got-35-000-hidden-in-wine-box/11585342\">\u201chates my guts\u201d</a>. </p> <p>Murnain came under significant pressure during hearings of the Independent Commission Against Corruption, which was examining whether Huang, a banned donor, gave $100,000 cash to NSW Labor in 2015.</p> <p>The commission has heard the cash donation was brought into NSW Labor headquarters in an Aldi shopping bag during Clements\u2019 time as general secretary, and was later covered up using a series of false disclosures from fake donors.</p> <p>Murnain said she had learnt of the Huang donation in 2016, after an evening meeting with the former Labor MP Ernest Wong outside state parliament. Acting on the advice of then Labor senator Sam Dastyari, Murnain said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/28/man-dumbfounded-by-invoice-for-5000-labor-donation-he-never-made-icac-told\">she sought out the party\u2019s lawyer</a>, Ian Robertson, who allegedly told her to keep quiet and do nothing further.</p> <p>\u201cAt the end of the conversation, Ian said to me \u2018there is no need to do anything from here\u2019,\u201d Murnain said at the Icac inquiry. \u201c\u2018Don\u2019t record this meeting.

She said she had presided over three independent reviews and acted on their recommendations, including by banning cash donations, introducing real-time donation disclosure, creating a code of conduct, appointing a governance director, and training staff and creating policies.</p> <p>\u201cThere has been a lot said recently about the culture of the party.

      "bodyText": "The outgoing Labor boss Kaila Murnain has slammed her party\u2019s inability to grapple with its \u201cnasty culture of sexism\u201d and urged it to pursue \u201creal and lasting reform\u201d to improve integrity. Murnain formally announced her resignation as NSW Labor general secretary on Thursday following explosive evidence heard at an anti-corruption probe that she had kept quiet for almost three years about unlawful donations from the Chinese billionaire Huang Xiangmo. Murnain was suspended in August from the position she had held since 2016, when, at 29, she became the first woman to hold the top job in NSW Labor. \u201cThe circumstances leading up to my election in 2016 were horrendous,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of these events were reported in the media at the time, and some of these events have received more recent attention. \u201cHowever, I believe it is inarguable that our party has never fully grappled with the nasty culture of sexism which women face in politics.\u201d Murnain\u2019s predecessor, Jamie Clements, had resigned in the wake of accusations of sexual harassment, which he denied. Clements told an Icac inquiry recently that Murnain \u201chates my guts\u201d. Murnain came under significant pressure during hearings of the Independent Commission Against Corruption, which was examining whether Huang, a banned donor, gave $100,000 cash to NSW Labor in 2015. The commission has heard the cash donation was brought into NSW Labor headquarters in an Aldi shopping bag during Clements\u2019 time as general secretary, and was later covered up using a series of false disclosures from fake donors. Murnain said she had learnt of the Huang donation in 2016, after an evening meeting with the former Labor MP Ernest Wong outside state parliament. Acting on the advice of then Labor senator Sam Dastyari, Murnain said she sought out the party\u2019s lawyer, Ian Robertson, who allegedly told her to keep quiet and do nothing further. \u201cAt the end of the conversation, Ian said to me \u2018there is no need to do anything from here\u2019,\u201d Murnain said at the Icac inquiry. \u201c\u2018Don\u2019t record this meeting. Don\u2019t put it in your diary. Forget the conversation happened with Ernest. I won\u2019t be billing you for this either \u2026 and don\u2019t tell anyone about it.\u2019\u201d Robertson flatly denies giving any such advice. Murnain was suspended following her evidence to Icac. On Thursday, Murnain pointed to the work she had done to improve party integrity. She said she had presided over three independent reviews and acted on their recommendations, including by banning cash donations, introducing real-time donation disclosure, creating a code of conduct, appointing a governance director, and training staff and creating policies. \u201cThere has been a lot said recently about the culture of the party. Over the past three years we have worked incredibly hard to improve that culture, however, it is clear more work needs to be done to grapple with legacy issues in the 128 year old organisation.\u201d The Sydney Morning Herald this week reported Murnain\u2019s payout would be about $700,000. Murnain said she and her family had been through \u201can incredibly difficult time\u201d and slammed much of the media reporting as inaccurate. \u201cI dedicated my entire life to Labor. I am devastated to leave. I\u2019m sorry to have let you down.\u201d",

Sure, we are barred from preaching, we are excluded from all meaningful leadership positions, and I have lost count of the number of times we have been made to feel deeply ashamed of our very presence. But this week we, along with our strongest allies, have finally been asked to leave, and by none other than our own archbishop, Glenn Davies. Why? Because we are those who have found deep beauty in the blessing of gay and lesbian marriages and we long for others to share in this joy. From his address, it\u2019s hard to discern whether he is ousting individuals or those dioceses that have made moves to bless same-sex marriage, but ultimately there is no difference \u2013 if an entire region is blacklisted for pursuing something we hold dear, what message does that send me?

      "bodyText": "Live political reporting continues on Thursday\u2019s blog: Most of the rest of the day was spent processing the White House meeting to talk about Syria and Turkey: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi claimed that President Trump had a \u201cvery serious meltdown\u201d. Trump attempted to strike back by tweeting about \u201cNervous Nancy\u201d and her \u201cunhinged meltdown\u201d - but all it did was give Pelosi a new photo for social media. In the meeting itself, it came out that Trump called former secretary of defense Jim Mattis \u201cthe world\u2019s most overrated general\u201d. Pelosi hit back hard at Trump, telling him that \u201call roads with you lead to Putin\u201d. Trump kept tweeting. Thanks for tuning in, everybody. Don\u2019t be a fool! Of note: today marked President Trump\u2019s 1,000th day in office. US Immigration and Enforcement confirmed today that another detainee died in custody on Tuesday. Roylan Hernandez-Diaz, 43, a Cuban national, was found unresponsive in his cell at the Richwood Correctional Center in Louisiana. He\u2019s been in custody since May. Preliminary cause of death appears to be self-inflicted strangulation, but the case is still under investigation. Hernandez-Diaz is the second detainee this month to die in ICE custody. Nebane Abienwi, 37, died while undergoing treatment for a brain hemorrhage on 1 October. President Trump wanted to shame House Speaker Nancy Pelosi when he tweeted out the photo of her from the meeting about Syria and Turkey today. Press secretary Stephanie Grisham ironically quoted senate minority leader Chuck Schumer saying, \u201cThe Speaker kept her cool\u201d when she tweeted out the photo, as if the photo depicted Pelosi not keeping her cool in some way. Unfortunately for the Trump administration, all they really did was make Pelosi look like the only woman at a table full of men, making sure her point was heard. And Pelosi evidently thought the photo made her look pretty cool too: Pelosi also made the photo her Facebook background pic too: House Intelligence Committee chair Adam Schiff sent out an impeachment inquiry update letter to his colleagues In lashing out against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, President Trump provides us with a nice visual of the most talked-about meeting in Washington today. Trump appears to be attempting to reclaim the term \u201cmeltdown\u201d from Pelosi, but in tweeting out this photo, the president only seems to be drumming up more support for her. And throughout all this, President Trump has been tweeting up a storm. His latest is, perhaps, most baffling: More is coming out of the heated White House meeting regarding Syria and Turkey - you know, the meeting that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi described as a \u201cvery serious meltdown\u201d for President Trump. If you\u2019re just tuning in today, the buzzwords of the last hour or so are \u201cthird-rate politician\u201d, possibly \u201cthird-grade politician\u201d, \u201ca very serious meltdown\u201d and \u201cworld\u2019s most overrated general\u201d. All great Halloween costume ideas! A third-rate insult, perhaps? However, it should be noted that there is some dispute over the insult in question: The White House responds to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her description of President Trump having a \u201cvery serious meltdown\u201d: According to multiple reports, President Trump lashed out at former secretary of defense Jim Mattis - a retired Marine Corps general. Meanwhile, amidst reports on this \u201cvery serious meltdown\u201d, President Trump tweets: Here\u2019s more from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on President Trump and his \u201cvery serious meltdown\u201d: Hey all, Vivian Ho with the west coast bureau here. Let\u2019s see where the rest of today takes us. That\u2019s it from me today. The Guardian\u2019s west coast team will take over the blog for the next couple of hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: The House overwhelmingly voted to condemn Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw US troops from northern Syria, with about two-thirds of the chamber\u2019s Republicans backing the resolution. Nancy Pelosi said Trump had a \u201cmeltdown\u201d during a White House meeting on Syria, and Chuck Schumer added that the president called the House speaker \u201ca third-rate politician.\u201d Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell intends to wrap up a trial on whether to remove Trump from office by the end of the year if the House votes to impeach him. Another associate of Rudy Giuliani\u2019s was arrested for allegedly violating campaign-finance laws. Tax documents from the president\u2019s company include major discrepancies, according to ProPublica. The Guardian team will have more on the news of the day, so stay tuned. According to a letter obtained by a Fox Business reporter, Trump wrote a letter last week to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan urging him to avoid a humanitarian disaster in Syria. The letter, which is dated October 9, begins: \u201cLet\u2019s work out a good deal! You don\u2019t want to be responsible for slaughtering thousands of people, and I don\u2019t want to be responsible for destroying the Turkish economy -- and I will.\u201d Trump concludes the letter: \u201cDon\u2019t be a tough guy. Don\u2019t be a fool! I will call you later.\u201d The White House confirmed the letter\u2019s authenticity to multiple reporters, and Trump referenced it earlier today when asked whether he was surprised by Erdogan\u2019s actions. But one New York Times reporter expressed skepticism about when the letter was sent. An ABC News reporter noted that the Syria meeting marked the first face-to-face interaction between Trump and Nancy Pelosi since the House speaker formally launched an impeachment inquiry against the president late last month. Speaking to reporters after the White House meeting on Syria, Nancy Pelosi said senior lawmakers witnessed Trump having a \u201cmeltdown.\u201d The House speaker added that Trump was rattled after nearly two-thirds of the House GOP caucus voted to condemn his decision to withdraw US troops from northern Syria. Leaving a White House meeting on the situation in Syria, senator Chuck Schumer said that Trump was disrespectful to Nancy Pelosi and called the House speaker \u201ca third-rate politician.\u201d The Senate minority leader also complained that Trump has no plan on how to contain ISIS now that he has withdrawn US troops from northern Syria. Another poll has found that a narrow majority of Americans believe Trump should be removed from office. According to the latest Gallup survey, 52 percent of Americans say Trump should be impeached and removed from office, while 46 percent say he should not. Although public opinion remains very mixed on impeachment, it\u2019s worth noting that this figure is significantly higher than the percentage of Americans who supported the impeachment of Bill Clinton and only slightly behind support for Richard Nixon\u2019s removal prior to his resignation. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell is planning to keep the chamber in session six days a week to conclude an impeachment trial against Trump by the end of the year, the Kentucky Republican told reporters on Capitol Hill. Politico has more: McConnell told Senate Republicans on Wednesday that he expects Speaker Nancy Pelosi to approve articles of impeachment as early as Thanksgiving, according to five people familiar with Wednesday\u2019s party lunch. McConnell then surmised that the Senate could deal with the trial by Christmas, concluding the impeachment proceedings before the Democratic presidential primaries begin. While they said there\u2019s no deal between Pelosi and McConnell, Republican senators believe it\u2019s in both parties\u2019 interest to move quickly. ... McConnell\u2019s comments and PowerPoint presentation on Wednesday were in part an acknowledgment that impeachment is exceedingly likely to come to the Senate, and much of the discussion centered on the ins and outs of Senate procedure. McConnell told senators they would be unable to speak during the trial and that only the chief justice of the Supreme Court, the president\u2019s defenders and the House managers could talk, said one person familiar with the meeting. The blog is following news on multiple fronts right now. In addition to the House vote to condemn Trump\u2019s withdrawal of US troops from northern Syria, there is impeachment-related news. Michael McKinley, the former senior adviser to secretary of state Mike Pompeo, has concluded his closed-door testimony after speaking to House investigators for about five hours. McKinley reportedly told lawmakers that he was disappointed in Pompeo\u2019s silence as far-right commentators smeared the reputation of Maria Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine. It\u2019s worth noting, given how partisan congressional politics have become, that about two-thirds of House Republicans voted to condemn Trump\u2019s withdrawal of US troops from northern Syria. The Republicans who backed the president\u2019s widely criticized decision largely come from some of the most conservative districts in the country. Meanwhile, senator Lindsey Graham, who is usually closely aligned with the president, is pleading with Trump to listen to his national security team and reconsider his stance on Syria. House speaker Nancy Pelosi is also complaining that the administration has canceled a classified briefing for lawmakers on the situation in Syria. The House vote to condemn Trump\u2019s troop withdrawal from northern Syria came just hours after the president called the widely criticized decision \u201cstrategically brilliant.\u201d Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate majority leader, also opened his weekly press conference by thanking the Kurds shortly after Trump said the American allies were \u201cno angels.\u201d The distinctly different messaging coming from Trump and congressional Republicans on this crucial matter of foreign policy could threaten the party unification that the president desperately needs in order to ward off impeachment. In a rare showing of bipartisan agreement, the House has just overwhelmingly voted to condemn Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw US troops from northern Syria. The final vote was 354-60. Representative Eliot Engel, the Democratic chairman of the House foreign affairs committee who introduced the resolution, said: \u201cAt President Trump\u2019s hands, American leadership has been laid low, and American foreign policy has become nothing more than a tool to advance his own interests. \u201cToday we make clear that the Congress is a coequal branch of government and we want nothing to do with this disastrous policy.\u201d Federal authorities investigating ties between Rudy Giuliani and allegedly corrupt Ukrainian figures are reportedly exploring whether those wealthy foreigners tried to exploit their connection to the president\u2019s personal lawyer to gain political influence. CNN reports: Kenneth McCallion, a New York attorney, says that investigators first approached him earlier this year to ask about Giuliani\u2019s ties to Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, two Giuliani associates indicted last week on campaign-finance related charges. McCallion says FBI counterintelligence agents in February or March asked questions about some of Giuliani\u2019s Ukrainian business dealings. The counterintelligence probe hinges in part on whether a foreign influence operation was trying to take advantage of Giuliani\u2019s business ties in Ukraine and with wealthy foreigners to make inroads with the White House, according to one person briefed on the matter. Bill Taylor asked to testify House Democratic committee leaders have asked Bill Taylor, acting ambassador to Ukraine, to appear for a Congressional deposition next week. Taylor, a career diplomat, will likely be a critical piece to the House\u2019s impeachment investigation. \u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d Taylor wrote in messages between US and Ukraine diplomatic officials that were released earlier this month. Kurds are \u2018no angels\u2019 Trump laid out some bewildering talking points about Turkey at the White House press conference with Italian president Sergio Mattarella just moments ago. Besides saying the Kurdish PKK is worse than Isis, the president was asked about whether he was concerned about the spread of Isis. He continued to defend his decision to pull troops by saying the Kurds are \u201cno angels\u201d. Trump also hit back at his allies-turned-critics, particularly Lindsey Graham, who publicly criticized Trump\u2019s decision. Trump: PKK is \u2018worse than Isis\u2019 Donald Trump is speaking at a press conference at the White House now with Italian President Sergio Mattarella. In remarks, Trump defended his decision to pull troops from northern Syria saying that the Kurdish PKK, which had been receiving US support, is \u201cworse at terror and more of a terrorist threat, in many ways, than Isis\u201d. ProPublica got their hands on documents that show Donald Trump\u2019s company gave a lender and New York City tax authorities two different set of numbers for two of the company\u2019s Manhattan buildings \u2013 40 Wall Street and the Trump International Hotel and Tower. The documents show questionable differences in some expense, profit and occupancy figures. For example, the company told lenders that 40 Wall Street was 58.9% leased in 2012 but then rose to 95% a few years later. It told tax officials the building was 81% leased in 2013. Trump\u2019s company technically doesn\u2019t own 40 Wall Street, rather it pays the wealthy German family that owns it a sum of money to rent it out to tenants. In 2015, Trump\u2019s company told tax authorities that it paid the family $1.65 million to use the building, while it told told lenders it paid $1.24 million the same year. Don Jr.\u2019s girlfriend says he \u2018likes it when I play nurse\u2019 Kimberly Guilfoyle, Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s girlfriend, who joined Trump\u2019s reelection campaign in April as a senior advisor, said at a Texas panel discussion support Trump\u2019s reelection that Don Jr. \u201clikes it when I play nurse,\u201d according to a report from the Washington Examiner. \u201cI know Donald Trump Jr. a little better, let\u2019s just get that out of the way right now,\u201d she told the crowd. Try to hold on to your lunch because ewww. Giuliani associate turned himself in Back to our last post on the arrest of David Correia, an associate of Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Correia was arrested at a New York City airport this morning for breaking campaign finance laws, and reports said Correia flew into New York to turn himself in. Correia joins two men, both associated with Giuliani, who were charged with making illegal contributions to a political action committee supporting Trump in hopes of getting support for a recreational marijuana business. Giuliani has said he has no knowledge of illegal donations. The four defendants are expected to appear in federal court tomorrow. Here is video of that exchange between Biden and Warren. Perhaps the most memorable moment of the debate was a split-second pause delivered by US senator and Democratic hopeful Elizabeth Warren. Former vice president Joe Biden had just cut into Warren detailing her accomplishments, raising his voice and pointing a hand toward her: \u201cI went on the floor and got you votes! I got votes for that bill!\u201d Biden\u2019s interjection \u2013 his interruption of Warren to give credit to himself \u2013 was met with eyerolls on Twitter. Turns out Biden\u2019s role in the creation of the CFPB was negligible at best. Not worth the interjection that, for many, came off as mansplaining. Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg is on the attack following last night\u2019s debate \u2013 a shift in position for the mayor who largely avoided attacking his rivals. Just to add on to our earlier post \u2013 Trump said his troop withdrawal from northern Syria would leave the conflict between Syria and Turkey. What we didn\u2019t catch earlier was his comment that the Kurds are \u201cnot angels\u201d. The Guardian\u2019s podcast Today in Focus describes the fall-out from Trump\u2019s decision. Listen here: This just in from the Associated Press: A Florida man wanted in a campaign finance case involving associates of Rudy Giuliani is in federal custody. Federal authorities say they took David Correia into custody Wednesday at Kennedy Airport in New York City. Correia is named in an indictment with two Giuliani associates arrested last week on charges they made illegal contributions to a congressman and a political action committee supporting President Donald Trump. Giuliani is Trump\u2019s personal lawyer. He says he had no knowledge of illegal donations. Prosecutors say Correia conspired with other defendants to make political donations with the aim of trying to get support for a new recreational marijuana business. Four defendants are expected to appear Thursday in federal court in Manhattan. A lawyer for Correia is not yet listed in court records. Trump addressed his withdrawal of troops from Northern Syria in a photo-op with Italian President Sergio Mattarella. The withdrawal has caused formerly American-allied Syrian Kurds to flee the region, as Turkey mounts a military offensive. This latest report out from the Associated Press: President Donald Trump said US troops are \u201clargely out\u201d of a region of Syria where Turkish forces are attacking Kurdish fighters. Turkey launched a military operation against Kurdish fighters allied with the US after Trump pulled troops from the region this month. As he met Wednesday with Italy\u2019s president, Trump said: \u201cIf Syria wants to fight to take back their land, that\u2019s up to them and Turkey.\u201d He added: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of sand that they can play with.\u201d But as Trump defends removing troops from northeastern Syria, he\u2019s talking up his recent decision to send more troops to Saudi Arabia to help the kingdom defend against Iran. Trump says the US is sending missiles and \u201cgreat power\u201d to the Saudis, and adds: \u201cThey\u2019re paying for that.\u201d Mulvaney\u2019s key role in Ukraine crisis New reports reveal Mick Mulvaney, acting White House chief of staff, was likely a key facilitator of pressure on Ukraine. Mulvaney put three unlikely men \u2013 apparently nicknamed the \u201cthree amigos\u201d \u2013 in charge of managing Ukraine\u2019s aid account and kept experienced diplomats from the National Security Council and State Department out of discussions, according to the Washington Post. Mulvaney tapped diplomats Gordon Sondland and Kurt Volker and Department of Energy secretary Rick Perry to be in charge of the US-Ukraine account. The trio are emerging as key figures in the White House\u2019s interaction with Ukraine that are now under Congressional investigation. Officials say Mulvaney kept details of discussions with Sondland from former National Security Advisor John Bolton. Bolton\u2019s former aide, Fiona Hill, testified to Congress on Monday, revealing Bolton\u2019s deep concern with the back-channel efforts to pressure Ukraine. More news is starting to surface about how career diplomats have been sidelined in the Trump administration, allegedly to make room for political concerns. Here\u2019s the latest from the Washington Post: According to an anonymous source for the Post, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo senior advisor will testify: The unwillingness of State Department leadership to defend Yovanovitch or interfere with an obviously partisan effort to intervene in our relationship with Ukraine for the political benefit of the president was too much for him.\u201d Kurt Volker, former US special envoy to Ukraine and a key figure in the Congress\u2019 impeachment investigation, just made a surprise appearance on Capitol Hill. Volker, who abruptly resigned late September at the beginning of Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment crisis, privately testified before members of Congress Oct. 3. Volker arranged a meeting between Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and a presidential aide. Volker maintains he was unaware of any desire to urge Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden. Here\u2019s a bit of news on the Trump administration\u2019s decision to withdraw troops from northern Syria, leaving the once American-allied Syrian Kurds to defend themselves against Turkish aggression. From Reuters: US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday said he and US Vice President Mike Pence expect to meet with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan when they travel to Turkey this week. Pompeo, in an interview on Fox Business Network, said the US delegation was planning to leave later on Wednesday and that the goal was to find a resolution to situation in Syria, not break the US-Turkey relationship. Another worry for former vice president Joe Biden \u2013 he has been burning through fundraising cash. His spending outpaced Democratic rivals in spending through September, the AP reported this morning. Biden had $8.9m in the bank \u2013 a fraction of the $33.7m and $25.7m that Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, respectively. Mayor Pete Buttigieg followed the pack with savings of $23.3m. A hefty bank account allows candidates to spend strategically leading up to spring primaries. The money will allow Sanders, Warren and Buttigieg to buy ads in early voting states like Iowa and New Hampshire. While we\u2019re looking at the new endorsement from AOC, we will let Washington governor and former Democratic presidential candidate Jay Inslee tell you about last night\u2019s big omission... Here is more on the endorsement the Sanders campaign picked up from progressive House Democrats, from our story this morning: Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s shock move ends months of speculation about the plans of the Bronx politician, who is hugely popular with the progressive wing of the party. The endorsement is a major coup for Sanders, whose campaign has failed to move to the top of a broad Democratic field, and a blow to his fellow progressive senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who has emerged as the race\u2019s new frontrunner. Ocasio-Cortez is one of the four members of \u201cthe Squad\u201d, a group of four freshman congresswomen of color whose liberal policies and pointed critiques of Donald Trump have earned them praise from many on the left and virulent attacks from many conservatives. The other squad members are Michigan\u2019s Rashida Tlaib, Minnesota\u2019s Ilhan Omar and Massachusetts\u2019 Ayanna Pressley. The Sanders campaign also announced on Tuesday night that Omar had endorsed the senator. Good morning, US politics watchers, it\u2019s the day after the Democratic debate in Ohio and there\u2019s a lot going on, so stay tuned. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and fellow member of the self-named Squad of progressive first-term Democratic congresswomen, Ilhan Omar, endorsed Vermont Senator and 2020 candidate Bernie Sanders after the Democratic primary debate in Ohio last night. Rashida Tlaib is expected to follow suit. No word from the fourth member Ayanna Pressley yet. Mike McKinley, a former US ambassador and, until he resigned last week, a senior adviser to secretary of state Mike Pompeo, is due to testify today behind closed doors to the Democratic-led House committees running the impeachment inquiry. Donald Trump is meeting with Italian president Sergio Mattarella at the White House this morning and the pair will hold a noon Rose Garden press conference.",
