A stranger picks it up and follows her in a bid to return it, but the woman has disappeared. He searches the streets and spots her in a coffee shop. He will accept no reward for his gallantry. This is perhaps the least likely thing that happens in Informer. Seconds later, a terrorist gunman runs in and shoots the good Samaritan, which is more believable than the random act of kindness that put him in the path of the bullet in the first place.</p> <p>Never mind \u2013 we are moving swiftly on. In an empty courtroom, counter-terrorism officer DS Gabe Waters (Paddy Considine) \u2013 known to us only as Witness K \u2013 is giving evidence about the attack. \u201cI can\u2019t discuss it in an open forum,\u201d he says.</p> <p>One year earlier. We are now focused on another character: the cheeky, slightly roguish Raza Shar (Nabhaan Rizwan, <em>above</em>), as he nicks a camera, liberates his little brother from a school detention and buys some pills for a night out. So, it is possible that the beginning of the story was, in fact, the ending. Or it could be that the whole opening segment was a red herring.</p> <p>The narrative steadies itself after this, but there is still an unsettling, disjointed quality to Informer: much of it, you realise, will only make sense in the fullness of time. Waters has a troubled past. Seemingly minor characters shine with a weird intensity, as if to signal the viewer: remember this guy, he is going to be important later.</p> <p>To a degree, this disjointedness suits the material \u2013 it keeps you on your toes. In the shady milieu of police informers, no piece of information is to be trusted entirely. But it is confusing. By the end of episode one, we are not much nearer to figuring out how the first scene is connected to anything that follows. Lost Phone Lady does reappear, though; I was right about that.</p> <p>Waters maintains a large network of informers in the fight against terrorism, expecting little loyalty and giving none in return. \u201cThey\u2019ll grass on their mates, their families, they\u2019ll just as easily turn on you,\u201d he tells his green new partner, Holly Morten (Bel Powley). \u201cIf they give you any trouble, you drop them.\u201d</p> <p>Ostensibly, they are investigating a recently blown-up terrorist called Ahmed El Adoua, after discovering that he had made a visit to London some months before, when he may have trained some local extremists. Mostly, their investigation involves meeting informers down dodgy alleyways, pumping them for information and not believing their answers. When Shar gets arrested for possession on his night out, Morten attempts to recruit him as her first informer. He is resistant, naturally, but Morten proves to be persistent and callous. We know Shar is going to give in long before he does.</p> <p>The main performances are very strong. Considine, who is always good, is suitably world-weary, and Powley is quite scary as Morten. Rizwan is, by turns, charming and irritating as Shar. But it is the supporting cast that really stand out. Shar\u2019s overnight cellmate, Dadir Hassan (Roger Jean Nsengiyumva) is particularly great in a role destined to expand over the coming weeks, as is Arsher Ali as an undercover cop who has been out on the streets too long. In this gritty shadow world, where no one is wholly on one side or the other, it is surprising how good-looking everyone is. You would think that would constitute some kind of drawback.</p> <p>Informer is a gripping and engaging thriller. The structure may be a little artful \u2013 sometimes the main challenge is keeping track \u2013 but I am looking forward to the jigsaw finally locking together, even if, at this stage, the pieces all seem to be from different puzzles.

      "bodyText": "\u201cVery deep is the well of the past. Should we not call it bottomless?\u201d So begins the prelude of Thomas Mann\u2019s \u201cJoseph and his Brothers\u201d, a set of four novels that details the life of Jacob and his son Joseph described in the Book of Genesis. The prelude is pointedly titled \u201cDescent into Hell\u201d. I have recently started reading the 1,400-page work and the first lines remind me how over the past four years since Donald Trump announced his candidacy for president of the United States we have noted each passing depth in the plunge of ignorance, bigotry and megalomania and wondered if surely we have reached the bottom. And yet if we are honest we can truly only say that so very deep is the well of his ignorance and bigotry that should we not say it is bottomless? Of course idiocy is not limited to American politicians. This week our resources minister, Matt Canavan, suggested that engineering firm Aurecon was \u201cweak as piss\u201d for cutting ties with the Adani mine project and that the energy sector should \u201cshun and shame\u201d the company. Our prime minister also suggested to a room of public servants that people had lost trust in the public service because of the \u201cperception that politics is very responsive to those at the top and those at the bottom, but not so much to those in the middle\u201d. Yes, it is all those people at the bottom getting so much preferential treatment that is the problem. But at least this stupidity is just your standard conservative politician trying to find rationality in their illogical policies. With Trump much worse forces are at work. This week in the space of a day Trump announced he was cancelling a meeting with the Danish prime minister because she said his suggestions for the US to buy Greenland were absurd. He responded by calling her \u201cnasty\u201d \u2013 his favourite slur towards any woman who dares not genuflect and kiss his small hands. He followed this by tweeting a quote from a far-right conspiracy theorist (as you do), Wayne Allyn Root, that \u201cthe Jewish people in Israel love him, like he\u2019s the King of Israel. They love him like he is the second coming of God.\u201d This came a day after he said: \u201cI think any Jewish people that vote for a Democrat, I think it shows either a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty.\u201d Given the history of antisemites claiming Jews were not loyal to their countries, linking that with a suggestion of their lack of intelligence meant pretty much all he had to do was bring up cultural Marxism and he\u2019d have the antisemitic trifecta. He then, while referring to his trade war with China (for it truly is his, not the United States\u2019), said he had to do it because he declared as he looked to the heavens: \u201cI am the chosen one.\u201d Add in his argument that the government should abolish the right for anyone born in the US to have automatic citizenship and you have a pretty full day. This of course came after his obligatory suggestion that \u201cI am the least racist person ever to serve in office, OK? I am the least racist person\u201d \u2013 a statement so dully idiotic that it now just breezes past the listener with barely a recognition that were any human being to say such a thing they would have lost all credibility. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning It remains quite stunning to see it all play out in real time \u2013 the ongoing descent and even more so the ongoing acceptance that this is normal and he is a president who should be treated with respect and even deference. The Australian government certainly does. This week \u2013 to the surprise of no one \u2013 they (and the ALP) agreed to send 200 troops, a frigate and a surveillance plane to the Middle East to help a US-led mission in the Strait of Hormuz. Let us be clear, the trouble in the Strait is all of Trump\u2019s doing. He was the one who pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal put in place by president Barack Obama and reimposed crippling economic sanctions. This was not done because Iran was not honouring the treaty but because Trump hated that the deal had been made by Obama. Since then Iran has essentially acted like a party which has little to lose and with much desire to show it has muscles to flex. And so here we are, with the conflict between the US and Iran heating up, all of which was predicted the moment Trump appointed the belligerent John Bolton as his national security adviser \u2013 a man who has never made any secret about his desire to bomb Iran back to the biblical age. In the past we have looked past the foibles and inadequacies of US presidents and kept our alliance strong, and often gone well beyond any commitments we had under the Anzus treaty. This was ill-advised in the extreme when it came to George W Bush, a president so bad it has taken the lows of Trump to resurrect his reputation (something that is not deserved no matter how many mints he passes to Michelle Obama during funeral services). The realpolitik of dealing with Trump is to hold your nose and flatter him and get as good a deal that he can be suckered into giving because somewhat unusual for a con artist he is unable to distinguish false flattery from true deference. But surely at some point we need to take a stand and say no more. We won\u2019t of course. Scott Morrison will angle for a dinner at the White House, and given their shared lack of care about climate change Morrison is likely to use chances of Trump\u2019s re-election as an excuse to do as little as possible to reduce emissions. Indeed Trump\u2019s re-election in 2020 would essentially doom the planet to breach the 1.5C level above pre-industrial times that is seen as the tipping point between a planet as we know it and one where the changes to our life will be noticeable, costly and harsh. Trump is unfortunate proof that it does actually matter who gets elected. His economic policies are bad for the world economy (and Australia\u2019s), his climate change and defence policies are just bad for the world. There is no bottom, and right now there is every sense that our government is fully prepared to follow him all the way down. \u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

      "bodyText": "The Australian Taxation Office has hit the British-Dutch oil giant Shell with a bill estimated at $755m as it continues to pursue multinational resources giants over claims they have avoided paying tax on offshore gas projects. Court documents reveal Shell\u2019s main Australian company, Shell Energy Holdings Australia, has been fighting the ATO for six years over tax on the company\u2019s stake in the $30bn Browse gas project off the coast of north-west Western Australia. The ATO\u2019s pursuit of Shell is part of a broader effort to shake money out of big oil and gas projects that one of the authority\u2019s most senior officials says has brought forward tax revenue by a decade. Second commissioner Jeremy Hirschhorn declined to comment on the Shell dispute but said he was \u201cvery confident\u201d big oil and gas projects would start to pay significant tax by 2021. In an interview with the Guardian, Hirschhorn also revealed that every year the ATO received an average of two leaked sets of data about the clients of accountants, law firms and other service providers around the world, and expressed relief at victory over mining group Glencore this month in a high court fight over the ATO\u2019s use of Paradise Papers documents. The previously secret Shell stoush is revealed in documents the company filed in the federal court this month after the ATO threw out its objections in June and July. Shell has asked the court to set aside the ATO\u2019s decision to disallow $2.2bn in deductions the company has claimed for buying shares of gas tenements from another partner in the Browse project, Chevron, in 2012 and 2014. Browse, Australia\u2019s largest untapped conventional gas resource, has been in development for 15 years but has never entered production because of falls in oil and gas prices. Tax law requires an asset to be used for exploration or mining before a deduction can be made. However, Shell told the federal court it \u201cused each asset by having it \u2018held in reserve\u2019 or otherwise held ready for use in its business\u201d. A Shell spokeswoman said the company was \u201cengaging with the Australian Taxation Office with a view to confirming the correct tax outcome of Shell\u2019s 2012 acquisition of interests in the Browse project\u201d. \u201cShell complies with all its legal and taxation obligations and is committed to paying the right amount of tax under the letter and the spirit of the law in all countries in which we operate,\u201d she said. Hirschhorn said the ATO acted early to squash the efforts of multinationals to send profits reaped from Australia\u2019s oil and gas boom offshore without paying any tax in the country. Two years ago, ATO officials were alarmed at the prospect that the big oil companies would avoid paying up to $10bn in tax over 10 years by pumping up the interest rate they paid on loans their local arms took out with offshore affiliates to finance the mega-projects. However, a legal victory over Chevron, the lead partner on the country\u2019s biggest project, Gorgon, emboldened the ATO to take on the rest of the industry. Last year, Chevron paid the ATO $866m to settle the lawsuit, which alleged the 9% interest rate charged on a US$2.5bn inter-company loan was far too high. In December last year, Hirschhorn was promoted from deputy commissioner in charge of large companies to second commissioner for client engagement \u2013 a euphemistic title that puts him in charge of tax enforcement and about half the ATO\u2019s 18,000 employees. He declined to comment on the Shell case but said the ATO continued to take action over related party debt and other tax issues in the resources sector. \u201cNot all those disputes have washed through,\u201d he said. He said it was natural that the big projects would pay little or no tax in their early years, due to the billions of dollars poured into building them that needed to be recouped before profits could be made. \u201cOur success will be as a tax office if they start paying tax, very significant tax, in 2021, 2022, which we\u2019re very confident will happen, rather than not paying tax up until the 2030s,\u201d he said. He said the ATO was \u201clate to the table\u201d in dealing with the use by mining companies including BHP and Rio Tinto of so-called \u201cmarketing hubs\u201d in Singapore to reduce tax in Australia. \u201cIt was really important for us to get ahead of the curve with the hubs for the gas producers, so we didn\u2019t have that problem right from the start, so that\u2019s been a big focus for us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been mostly successful and hoping to move to complete success.\u201d The attack on the resources sector also forms part of a broader ATO attack on \u201ctransfer pricing\u201d abuse, where the Australian arms of multinationals pay inflated prices for goods, services or loans to their offshore affiliates, thus siphoning money away from the country without tax being paid. Hirschhorn said the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law, which came into effect in 2016, had put an end to a practice where some multinationals liked to pretend their Australian arms did nothing but distribute boxes. \u201cBut in the real world they\u2019re a bit more than Australia Post, they\u2019ve got people meeting the doctors, they\u2019ve got people lobbying the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, they\u2019re actually selling stuff here,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are running a successful business which would ordinarily earn commissions. In the real world, you would not \u2018donate\u2019 that successful business, with its rewards and risks of earning commission, in order to go onto a \u2018cost plus 5%\u2019 business model, meaning that you pay minuscule tax in Australia [and earn most of your profits offshore in a tax haven]. \u201cI describe this as the \u2018kidney donor\u2019 approach to transfer pricing: just because you can point to someone living a full life on dialysis, doesn\u2019t support a proposition that someone would remove their own kidneys and go on dialysis to transfer the \u2018risks and rewards\u2019 of their kidneys to someone else.\u201d He said the high court\u2019s 14 August decision allowing the ATO to use documents from the Paradise Papers leak in a tax case against commodities group Glencore meant that \u201cthe status quo prevails\u201d. \u201cI read something by one journalist that said Australia\u2019s going to be a haven for hackers,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing\u2019s changed. If we had lost we would not have been able to rely on any information leaked or obtained from a law firm, or probably any whistleblowers. \u201cOn the existing Panama Papers we would have had to chuck them all out and pretend we had never seen them.\u201d He said the ATO would have to say \u201cthanks but no thanks\u201d to the average of two data leaks it received every year, mostly from other revenue agencies. It is understood the ATO is interested in a fresh leak of data from Malta, a major offshore centre that is often used as a gateway to Europe and is popular with Russian oligarchs. Hirschhorn said leaks were increasingly large. \u201cIn the old days people could only steal or take a couple of paper files, you had to photocopy them,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it can be gigabytes or terabytes of documents on one little USB.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s announcement this week that it will join US-led freedom of navigation operations patrolling the Strait of Hormuz brings the number of American allies willing to contribute to America\u2019s latest Middle East sortie to just three. The increasing tensions in the narrow, but critical, strait are almost universally regarded as an avoidable, US-created crisis, the result of Washington tearing up the Iran nuclear deal. \u201cIt starts and finishes with the US walking away from the JCPOA[the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on Iran]. We wouldn\u2019t be in this situation if the US hadn\u2019t acted in the way it has,\u201d Rodger Shanahan, a research fellow with the Lowy Institute, told the Guardian. \u201cThere is a lack of faith in US foreign policy decision-making under President Trump,\u201d Shanahan said. \u201cThe prospect of putting assets under a US command that has great capability but little coherent strategic direction does not excite many countries.\u201d Few countries are willing to sign up to an incoherent US foreign policy \u2013 one that at once proclaims to be defending the international rules-based order while unilaterally tearing up an agreement (while imperfect) it had brokered and signed up to: essentially throwing the rule book away in favour of its realist \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d on Iran through crippling sanctions. Unsurprising but disappointing Ashley Townshend, the director of foreign policy and defence at Sydney University\u2019s United States Studies Centre, said Australia\u2019s decision to join the US operation was \u201cunderstandable, unsurprising, but very disappointing\u201d, one principally made to satisfy a political request from the Trump administration. He argued that while Australia has clear interests in freedom of navigation and in securing energy supply lines through the Strait of Hormuz, Australia \u201cshould urge the [Trump] administration to return to a sensible path of diplomacy, which is how this ordeal can and should end\u201d. \u201cAmerica had a perfectly good deal with Iran to keep its nuclear ambitions in check \u2013 one that Australia and much of the international community supported. It was President Trump who tore it up. Canberra should condemn absolutely any coercion or use of force by Tehran in the Strait of Hormuz. But our focus should be on working with other like-minded countries to urge the White House back to the path of sensible diplomacy \u2013 one that will roll back the tensions created by Trump\u2019s unilateral withdrawal from the Iran deal.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The narrow Strait of Hormuz is globally significant. A third of the world\u2019s liquefied natural gas and almost 20% of global oil production passes through it. An increasingly unpredictable brinkmanship has emerged between the US and Iran since the US withdrew from the Iran deal in May 2018. Washington has pursued its \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d strategy through economic and trade sanctions, while Tehran has responded by stepping up its nuclear program beyond the limits of the deal. In July off the coast of Gibraltar, British marines working with Gibraltan police seized an Iranian supertanker suspected of carrying 2m barrels of oil to Syria in breach of sanctions. Spain said the interception had been conducted at the request of the US. In an apparent reprisal, Iran then seized two oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz, claiming the British and Liberian-flagged ships had breached maritime regulations. Less coalition of the willing than collection of the wary While the situation is deteriorating, there appears little enthusiasm for the US\u2019s strategy. A month after the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, declared the US would build a \u201cglobal coalition\u201d, just three countries, the UK, Bahrain and Australia, have agreed to contribute. Germany has refused an entreaty to join, while France has said it would not contribute to a US-led mission, but might consider a European-led one. (France and Germany are also less reliant on oil shipped through the strait than other economies, so there is a weaker economic imperative.) But Australia is on board. The defence minister, Linda Reynolds, has insisted Australia\u2019s contribution will be \u201cmodest, meaningful and time-limited\u201d, aimed at \u201cde-escalating tension in the gulf\u201d. \u201cThis operation is designed to do itself out of business,\u201d by ensuring freedom of navigation for shipping in the strait, she argued. Australia\u2019s contribution will be modest: a six-month deployment from a Major Fleet Unit (a naval warship, such as an Anzac class frigate) next year; a P8 Poseidon aircraft that will assist in patrols for a month, beginning later this year; and Australian Defence Force personnel who will work in the International Maritime Security Construct headquarters in Bahrain. It appears likely the most significant contribution will simply be a re-tasking of a regular ongoing commitment. Australia deploys a ship for nine months out of every 12 in the Persian Gulf as part of Operation Manitou \u2013 a multinational anti-terrorism and anti-piracy operation protecting shipping in the Gulf. Australia has been running these operations since the 1990s. Politics over policy Operationally then, the commitment is minimal: but it is the politics that are pre-eminent in Australia\u2019s calculation. Australia has been invited to the G7 this weekend, and the prime minister, Scott Morrison, will be received in Washington with a state visit in September. The decision to commit to the Strait of Hormuz is, as Shanahan argues, \u201ca smart move politically, because Washington is simply after the additional flag Australia provides, and we were after an \u2018announceable\u2019 to placate Washington\u201d. For a fractional commitment of personnel and materiel, Australia can firmly demonstrate its commitment to the US alliance, and it can do so far from the Indo-Pacific, where a more aggressive posture might aggrieve a sensitive Beijing. But memories of the Iraq invasion loom long, and, while this operation is on a tiny scale by comparison, there is concern in some quarters that Australia has chosen to follow America into another military intervention in the Middle East without any real public or political debate. The former secretary of the defence department Paul Barratt told the Guardian Australian involvement in potential military action in the Gulf could be illegal, and argued it was \u201cvery foolish for us to get involved in this provocative behaviour\u201d. \u201cThis is an application of military force.

In total he has sold more than 4m copies. He had wanted to write since he was a child, but didn\u2019t until he was in his 40s: \u201cI was so scared of trying I thought I had better really try and understand this problem.\u201d It took nine months to write Involuntary Witness; he had already lived the material. \u201cAnd then I had my answer, it sold over a million copies all over the world.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s a full-time writer now, and anyone watching him work, says Carofiglio, would think he was \u201ccrazy. I can sit writing for maybe six or seven minutes and then I have to stand up and do something and sit again for five minutes, I pour some coffee, I do some exercises, I check emails and then write again. It is very tiring by the end of the day I have done what I had to do.\u201d</p> <p>Born in Bari, southern Italy, in 1961, he still practises martial arts and karate which he learned with kids from \u201cthe most dangerous parts of the city\u201d, some of whom he would later arrest, \u201ca very strange unpleasant feeling, of course\u201d.</p> <p>Still, he doesn\u2019t believe the poverty in the south the alleged lack of any other choice, is an excuse for the criminal activity.</p> <p>\u201cIt is not totally about poverty,\u201d he says. \u201cOften, not always, criminality is a choice. The social issue is important but it is not the only thing thing to understand of why a boy becomes a criminal. Many of the ones that became a real problem came from good working families.\u201d</p> <p>He does agree that the mafia grew out of the chroniclawlessness, from a time before unification, \u201ca lack of state authority. The south had been ruled for a long, long time by different foreign countries. That means that the population didn\u2019t learn the attitude or respect for legal power because they didn\u2019t feel they belonged to the state or its rules. If they had a problem they didn\u2019t go to a legal tribunal. They went to the boss.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You must be able to use empathy even with the worst criminals, to see the world through their eyes</p> <footer> <cite>Gianrico Carofiglio</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Few people have more insight into the mafia mentality, the inner workings of Italy\u2019s organised crime, than someone whose job as a prosecutor was to interrogate men (rarely women) who had been arrested. To be good at this, says Carofiglio, you have to have empathy. \u201cYou must be able to use this even with the worst criminals, to see the world through their eyes. This is not sympathy; they are two different words. The worst cops and prosecutors are the ones who have a tendency towards moral judgment because that is very dangerous. It can interfere with your work and obscure your vision.\u201d</p> <p>He has learned \u201csome things about how a normal person becomes a criminal, then something more than a criminal. I was very raw when I started but I found out the world is much more complicated than the separation between good and evil. Many of these guys are like us. You find good ones and really bad ones and some bad ones who are nice people. You find good criminals who are people who did bad things because they needed a job, but didn\u2019t enjoy it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"310fe5a27fab1b7062da6348d0477ef2e60f8a8e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/310fe5a27fab1b7062da6348d0477ef2e60f8a8e/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gianrico Carofiglio at the Byron writers festival this month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gianrico Carofiglio at the Byron writers festival this month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kurt Petersen/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then there are the ones who \u201clike this kind of life, the money, the power. When we talk about mafia crimes we talk about rational crimes. They are done for commercial and technical reasons, for disturbing a business.\u201d</p> <p>At the Byron writers festival he was talking about his book, The Cold Summer, a barely fictionalised account of events in 1992, when it was all-out war. \u201cI don\u2019t like to call it a war because the correct frame should be we are the public and they are criminals; we are not fighting you, we are catching you. The very idea of a fight includes an idea of legitimisation. But at that time they were so powerful it was a war.\u201d</p> <p>He was a young prosecutor then, in 1992, in Puglia. Using transcripts of people he had interviewed throughout his career, central to the story is a \u201cjustice co-operator\u201d who is snitching for protection from a boss he has betrayed. And Carofiglio has laid it all out, as it happened, as it was. The crude savagery, paranoid cocaine-snorting bosses, the thuggery, the using fear to gain power. Blood was running through the picturesque white-washed Puglian villages. Where the sea is the deepest blue and the farms centuries old, there was endless, endless killing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/17/fbi-mafia-arrests-us-italy-inzerillo-gambino\">FBI and Italian police arrest 19 people in Sicily and US in mafia investigation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the same time as the judges were bombed in Palermo, the Puglian gangs were rising, having organised in prison for self-defence against harassment by the Neapolitan Camorra: \u201cWhen they finished their time and came out in the 90s we had a huge problem.\u201d Petty criminals had now become the sort of people who enslaved prostitutes and sold their babies - a syndicate he busted.</p> <p>He wrote this book because he wanted people to know the \u201ctruth about what happened in my country\u201d.

The Sopranos, the Godfather, this is not real life. They look like very smart people. This is simply not true. People think they are untouchable. This is not true. They are perfectly touchable and in fact we have touched them very hard. It is just sexier from a media point of view to think of poor cops and prosecutors trying to catch them and not succeeding.\u201d</p> <p>The truth is that \u201cthe real world is without glamour and is just full of shit and blood.

After the devastation of the bombings the state struck hard. \u201cFrom a strategic point of view it is a stupid thing for a criminal group to do to murder a judge or a prosecutor or a cop because you provoke an incredibly strong reaction,\u201d says Carofiglio.</p> <p>It was the beginning of the end of Cosa Nostra: \u201cThey were kings, but something people don\u2019t usually know is that all the important bosses have been caught, are in prison, have died, or will die in prison.

He carried a gun for so long that when he decided to stop some years ago he kept forgetting it wasn\u2019t there: \u201cI was always reaching for it \u2026 it was such a long time that I was carrying that gun.\u201d It was only recently that he surprised himself by sitting in a restaurant with his back to the entrance. \u201cIt was at that moment that I knew, OK, it\u2019s over, I don\u2019t feel unsafe any more.\u201d Carofiglio has put hundreds of mafioso into prison, first as a judge, then becoming a prosecutor: \u201cI feel more like a cop in my soul.\u201d He was appointed an adviser of the anti-mafia committee in the Italian parliament in 2007 and then served as a senator for the leftist Democratic party from 2008 to 2012, three of those years in opposition to Berlusconi (\u201cThat was the funniest period,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause we could exercise our creativity in opposition.\u201d) Since 2002 he has been writing crime novels, at first in his spare time, starring a recurring main character, a widely-read, jazz-loving philosophical prosecutor who thinks deeply about good and evil (he has retired this character now). In total he has sold more than 4m copies. He had wanted to write since he was a child, but didn\u2019t until he was in his 40s: \u201cI was so scared of trying I thought I had better really try and understand this problem.\u201d It took nine months to write Involuntary Witness; he had already lived the material. \u201cAnd then I had my answer, it sold over a million copies all over the world.\u201d He\u2019s a full-time writer now, and anyone watching him work, says Carofiglio, would think he was \u201ccrazy. I can sit writing for maybe six or seven minutes and then I have to stand up and do something and sit again for five minutes, I pour some coffee, I do some exercises, I check emails and then write again. It is very tiring by the end of the day I have done what I had to do.\u201d Born in Bari, southern Italy, in 1961, he still practises martial arts and karate which he learned with kids from \u201cthe most dangerous parts of the city\u201d, some of whom he would later arrest, \u201ca very strange unpleasant feeling, of course\u201d. Still, he doesn\u2019t believe the poverty in the south the alleged lack of any other choice, is an excuse for the criminal activity. \u201cIt is not totally about poverty,\u201d he says. \u201cOften, not always, criminality is a choice. The social issue is important but it is not the only thing thing to understand of why a boy becomes a criminal. Many of the ones that became a real problem came from good working families.\u201d He does agree that the mafia grew out of the chroniclawlessness, from a time before unification, \u201ca lack of state authority. The south had been ruled for a long, long time by different foreign countries. That means that the population didn\u2019t learn the attitude or respect for legal power because they didn\u2019t feel they belonged to the state or its rules. If they had a problem they didn\u2019t go to a legal tribunal. They went to the boss.\u201d Few people have more insight into the mafia mentality, the inner workings of Italy\u2019s organised crime, than someone whose job as a prosecutor was to interrogate men (rarely women) who had been arrested. To be good at this, says Carofiglio, you have to have empathy. \u201cYou must be able to use this even with the worst criminals, to see the world through their eyes. This is not sympathy; they are two different words. The worst cops and prosecutors are the ones who have a tendency towards moral judgment because that is very dangerous. It can interfere with your work and obscure your vision.\u201d He has learned \u201csome things about how a normal person becomes a criminal, then something more than a criminal. I was very raw when I started but I found out the world is much more complicated than the separation between good and evil. Many of these guys are like us. You find good ones and really bad ones and some bad ones who are nice people. You find good criminals who are people who did bad things because they needed a job, but didn\u2019t enjoy it.\u201d Then there are the ones who \u201clike this kind of life, the money, the power. When we talk about mafia crimes we talk about rational crimes. They are done for commercial and technical reasons, for disturbing a business.\u201d At the Byron writers festival he was talking about his book, The Cold Summer, a barely fictionalised account of events in 1992, when it was all-out war. \u201cI don\u2019t like to call it a war because the correct frame should be we are the public and they are criminals; we are not fighting you, we are catching you. The very idea of a fight includes an idea of legitimisation. But at that time they were so powerful it was a war.\u201d He was a young prosecutor then, in 1992, in Puglia. Using transcripts of people he had interviewed throughout his career, central to the story is a \u201cjustice co-operator\u201d who is snitching for protection from a boss he has betrayed. And Carofiglio has laid it all out, as it happened, as it was. The crude savagery, paranoid cocaine-snorting bosses, the thuggery, the using fear to gain power. Blood was running through the picturesque white-washed Puglian villages. Where the sea is the deepest blue and the farms centuries old, there was endless, endless killing. At the same time as the judges were bombed in Palermo, the Puglian gangs were rising, having organised in prison for self-defence against harassment by the Neapolitan Camorra: \u201cWhen they finished their time and came out in the 90s we had a huge problem.\u201d Petty criminals had now become the sort of people who enslaved prostitutes and sold their babies - a syndicate he busted. He wrote this book because he wanted people to know the \u201ctruth about what happened in my country\u201d. He is infuriated by the glamorising, the mythologising, of a strutting, spiv-suited mafia in films, television, books. \u201cIt is wrong to create mafia guys as heroes,\u201d he says. \u201cThe idea of an almighty mafia that is invincible and can do whatever they want is false. The Sopranos, the Godfather, this is not real life. They look like very smart people. This is simply not true. People think they are untouchable. This is not true. They are perfectly touchable and in fact we have touched them very hard. It is just sexier from a media point of view to think of poor cops and prosecutors trying to catch them and not succeeding.\u201d The truth is that \u201cthe real world is without glamour and is just full of shit and blood. You don\u2019t find nobility; you don\u2019t find honour.\u201d The Sicilian Cosa Nostra were once the most powerful criminal organisation in the world. After the devastation of the bombings the state struck hard. \u201cFrom a strategic point of view it is a stupid thing for a criminal group to do to murder a judge or a prosecutor or a cop because you provoke an incredibly strong reaction,\u201d says Carofiglio. It was the beginning of the end of Cosa Nostra: \u201cThey were kings, but something people don\u2019t usually know is that all the important bosses have been caught, are in prison, have died, or will die in prison. We have prosecuted and convicted thousands of these people. We won this battle.\u201d",

She says she would like to focus on her studies, but almost every day she has to fill out bullying reports. At the age of nine she transitioned, saying she always knew she was a girl but was assigned male at birth. Almost one year ago she criticised the prime minister, Scott Morrison, on TV for a tweet complaining about \u201cgender whisperers\u201d in schools. In August, Evie returned to high school in Melbourne after six weeks filming a new TV show, First Day, in which she plays a transgender teen in high school. Finishing work on the show and moving back to school has been challenging for Evie. The recent media coverage of trans issues hasn\u2019t helped, she says. Evie has had students using her pre-transition name (known as deadnaming) and asking why she is wearing girl\u2019s clothes, or doesn\u2019t use the boy\u2019s bathroom. \u201cMost [kids at school] go home and ask their parents about all this stuff and they come back with a negative reaction,\u201d she says. News Corp newspaper the Australian has taken a particular interest in trans and gender diverse children, and legislation being debated in Victoria to allow people to change the sex on their birth certificate. According to the ABC\u2019s Media Watch, the Australian has published over 18 articles in the past month, mostly negative, on the topic. Headlines have ranged from \u201cTransgender project \u2018out of balance\u2019\u201d to \u201cGender reassignment? They\u2019re castrating children\u201d. The peak body for healthcare for trans and gender diverse people, the Australian Professional Association for Trans Health (AusPATH), called the Australian\u2019s coverage \u201cbiased, emotive, and is not based on fact\u201d. The newspaper\u2019s coverage has set the tone for other media outlets, such as Sky News and radio station 2GB. But as with many other issues that get caught up in episodic outbreaks of Australia\u2019s culture wars, the reality of treatment for children is a long way from the headlines. Evidence based, individualised care Children like Evie are referred to the gender service at Royal Children\u2019s Hospital in Melbourne (RCH), where, after assessment, they can go through social transition before puberty, and go on to have puberty blockers and hormone therapy as part of their transition. Surgery does not commonly occur before a person turns 18, according to RCH. RCH\u2019s peer-reviewed guide, The Australian Standards of Care and Treatment Guidelines, was published in the Medical Journal of Australia last year, and later endorsed by The Lancet. The guide endorses gender-affirming care, based on available evidence and clinician consensus. It focuses on offering individualised care and says not every child will go on to take puberty blockers or hormones. It says counselling on fertility preservation options should be provided to all children before puberty blocking or hormone treatment commences. \u201cI think the biggest difference for our guideline as compared to previous ones is not only have we involved children in writing the guideline and their parents, but also we have really tried to listen to them about how they want to be cared for,\u201d gender service director Michelle Telfer told Joy. The Australian has claimed the guide is \u201cuncertain\u201d and \u201ccontentious\u201d, and argues there isn\u2019t enough evidence about the long-term impact of the gender-affirming process RCH has in place, if people want to \u201cdetransition\u201d. The rate of people who have regret over transitioning is very small, Telfer said, between 0.3% and 0.6% according to a recent comprehensive Dutch study. \u201cWhen we are criticised by people who don\u2019t really understand what we are doing they often say \u2018what if these kids change their mind?\u2019 and we can answer this risk is low,\u201d Telfer said. She said not providing treatment presents greater risk, including increased depression, increased anxiety and increased suicide risk. People who work in the area say the massive increase in the number of children referred to RCH in the past decade is due to increased public awareness but those who say it is a cause of alarm call it a \u201csocial contagion\u201d, a theory based on a study that has recently been discredited. Chief among those who subscribe to the theory is Western Sydney University paediatric professor John Whitehall. Whitehall has published numerous peer-reviewed papers in paediatrics and child health, but none to do with gender dysphoria or trans healthcare. Whitehall told Sky News this month that, in 50 years in medicine, he has never treated a child for gender-related issues. Yet Whitehall, who is a former deputy president of Fred Nile\u2019s Christian Democratic party, is quoted four times more in regard to trans issues than experts eminently more qualified in the field, according to media analytics data provided to Guardian Australia by Streem. As of 21 August, Whitehall has been quoted 61 times in major TV, radio, print and online in 2019, compared with just 14 collective mentions for Telfer, or GP and LGBTI health provider Dr Fiona Bisshop. Whitehall received the most coverage from the Australian, Sky News, and Macquarie Radio \u2013 parent company of 2GB.

      "body": "<p>For as long as any of us can remember, society has struck an \u201cintergenerational bargain\u201d. The younger generation agrees to support and look after their predecessors as they age. The older generation agrees to leave the world a better place for their offspring. But now, according to a new report, that bargain is under threat.</p> <p>Young Australians today face the prospect of being the first generation in living memory to be worse off than their parents, the Grattan Institute warns in its <a href=\"https://grattan.edu.au/report/generation-gap/\">Generation Gap report</a>.</p> <p>While Australian household wealth has nearly tripled over the past three decades, that growth hasn\u2019t reached everyone equally. \u201cHouseholds headed by someone aged 65-74 have an average equivalised net wealth of $1 million today, up from about $600,000 just 12 years ago. Meanwhile younger households have made barely any gains compared to a household of the same age 12 years ago,\u201d the report says.</p> <p>During that same period, poorer young Australians have seen a downward trend in their wealth.</p> <p>Rising house prices, high debt, stagnant wages and under-employment all threaten young people\u2019s ability to progress as much as their parents did. The report dismisses the stereotype of a millennial financial hedonism, finding that young people today are spending less on non-essential items than in the past.</p> <p>\u201cIf low wage growth and fewer working hours is the new normal in Australia, then we could have a generation emerge from young adulthood with lower incomes than the one before it at the same age,\u201d Grattan Institute\u2019s Danielle Wood warns. Such is already the case in the US and UK.</p> <p>What do young people think of their progress and prospects? Six young Australians share their stories.</p> <h2><strong>Arshdeep Cheema, 22, public health student, Melbourne</strong></h2> <p>I love the perception that young people are spending all their money on avocado breakfasts, because the majority of my girlfriends are some of the stingiest people you\u2019ll ever meet. Especially when you do come from a migrant background, you\u2019re very pushed to understand the value of money. So you grow up going, \u201cYeah, I have to save at every possible moment.\u201d</p> <p>Right now I\u2019ve got a budget spreadsheet. I make sure I count my savings, count any expenditure right down to a coffee. I think if anything we\u2019re very aware of what we spend our money on. But I think it comes down to the individual. I am sure it\u2019d be the exact same 20 or 30 years go.</p> <p>I migrated here when I was two from India, from Punjab. My parents\u2019 experience was very, very hard from what I know. My mum always tells me she never bought anything for herself. There was a fear we wouldn\u2019t have food on the table. I don\u2019t think we have that because we can always fall back on our parents.

But it\u2019s fun. I\u2019m happy with it. I\u2019d be working 26 to 30 hours a week. Uni is alright, but I\u2019m honestly just in and out. I just tend to stick to myself, focus on my studies.

I see friends do it, and they\u2019re going to be doing it all their lives. Sydney is very, very expensive. It looks like its apartments for all of us. We\u2019re realistic with it.

You just have to go with it. I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m happy about it. But I feel there\u2019s nothing we can do about it.

That\u2019s because I\u2019ve come from a lower socio-economic background. I\u2019ve grown up in a regional town and my mum has been on welfare my whole life. I\u2019m technically multi-generational welfare. I don\u2019t have the two parent, white picket fence, middle income family background.</p> <p>I\u2019m now earning more money than both my parents combined. My mobility has improved. However, I\u2019m also in debt \u2013 which is something that wouldn\u2019t have happened many years ago. I\u2019m in debt before I begin because of my qualifications, because of trying to improve my life. So I\u2019m doing worse off in that regard.</p> <p>I\u2019ve grown up as an only child and I think about who\u2019s going to be looking after my parents in their old age when they don\u2019t have a decent income of their own. They don\u2019t have superannuation or a valuable property. They\u2019re in a rural, remote area, so at some point they\u2019re going to have to relocate to a more expensive location, and they may not be able to afford to do that themselves. That will probably come on to my shoulders.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a780381f07a97c61833999873ab19e19c0221fff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a780381f07a97c61833999873ab19e19c0221fff/0_448_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Crystal McKendrick\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Crystal McKendrick grew up in a regional town but now lives in Brisbane.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: www.glennhunt.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Given my background, to think about an expensive mortgage definitely makes me very worried that I can\u2019t afford to live in the city, which is where all the work is.

      "bodyText": "For as long as any of us can remember, society has struck an \u201cintergenerational bargain\u201d. The younger generation agrees to support and look after their predecessors as they age. The older generation agrees to leave the world a better place for their offspring. But now, according to a new report, that bargain is under threat. Young Australians today face the prospect of being the first generation in living memory to be worse off than their parents, the Grattan Institute warns in its Generation Gap report. While Australian household wealth has nearly tripled over the past three decades, that growth hasn\u2019t reached everyone equally. \u201cHouseholds headed by someone aged 65-74 have an average equivalised net wealth of $1 million today, up from about $600,000 just 12 years ago. Meanwhile younger households have made barely any gains compared to a household of the same age 12 years ago,\u201d the report says. During that same period, poorer young Australians have seen a downward trend in their wealth. Rising house prices, high debt, stagnant wages and under-employment all threaten young people\u2019s ability to progress as much as their parents did. The report dismisses the stereotype of a millennial financial hedonism, finding that young people today are spending less on non-essential items than in the past. \u201cIf low wage growth and fewer working hours is the new normal in Australia, then we could have a generation emerge from young adulthood with lower incomes than the one before it at the same age,\u201d Grattan Institute\u2019s Danielle Wood warns. Such is already the case in the US and UK. What do young people think of their progress and prospects? Six young Australians share their stories. Arshdeep Cheema, 22, public health student, Melbourne I love the perception that young people are spending all their money on avocado breakfasts, because the majority of my girlfriends are some of the stingiest people you\u2019ll ever meet. Especially when you do come from a migrant background, you\u2019re very pushed to understand the value of money. So you grow up going, \u201cYeah, I have to save at every possible moment.\u201d Right now I\u2019ve got a budget spreadsheet. I make sure I count my savings, count any expenditure right down to a coffee. I think if anything we\u2019re very aware of what we spend our money on. But I think it comes down to the individual. I am sure it\u2019d be the exact same 20 or 30 years go. I migrated here when I was two from India, from Punjab. My parents\u2019 experience was very, very hard from what I know. My mum always tells me she never bought anything for herself. There was a fear we wouldn\u2019t have food on the table. I don\u2019t think we have that because we can always fall back on our parents. But I do think we don\u2019t have the same options as they had. Honestly, I don\u2019t see so much inequity, because the majority of the ageing population around me are still working in their 60s and 70s. I don\u2019t think they expect benefits. They feel they have to afford everything themselves. I think financial anxiety for young people is a very real thing. If we do choose to move out, we will be renting for a few years. There\u2019s really no stability, I\u2019m going to say that straight up.

      "bodyText": "Britain will contribute \u00a390m to a global fund that provides schooling for children in conflict zones, Boris Johnson will announce at the G7 summit on Sunday. Education Cannot Wait is a global fund established in 2016: it is based at Unicef and overseen by a steering group chaired by Gordon Brown. It is aiming to raise $1.8bn (\u00a31.5bn) from governments and other donors by 2021, and supports education projects in 18 countries including Somalia and Afghanistan. The UK has already contributed \u00a335m to the fund since its establishment, though Denmark and Canada are the most generous contributors. The additional \u00a390m announced this weekend should help provide schooling for up to 600,000 children. Reducing inequality is the overarching theme of the French-chaired G7, with gender inequality in education one of the issues on which president Macron is keen to see progress. Johnson made girls\u2019 education one of his pet projects when he was foreign secretary, and mentioned it as one of his three top priorities for the G7 summit as he landed in Biarritz. Speaking at the summit on Sunday, he is expected to say: \u201cInnocent children suffer the most from the brutal reality of life in the world\u2019s most dangerous countries. I\u2019m determined to ensure that all children have a chance to succeed \u2013 no matter where they are born. It is only through equipping the adults of tomorrow with learning and skills that we will break this cycle of instability. \u201cAnd it is girls that suffer the most, growing up in societies marred by violence. We owe them better. Girls\u2019 education is the Swiss Army knife that solves a multitude of the world\u2019s problems. Everyone benefits from a world where girls have the same opportunities as their brothers. Education Cannot Wait also tries to promote the argument that education should be a higher priority among international donors. Johnson will also urge his fellow leaders to spend more of their aid budget on promoting education. Save the Children estimated in 2017 that 420 million children are living in conflict zones. In that year, the UK spent 8.9% of its aid budget on education \u2013 but the average figure globally, according to Education Cannot Wait, is around 2%. When he was foreign secretary, Johnson was known to be keen to take closer control of the UK\u2019s aid budget, and there were suggestions during the Tory leadership contest that he could fold the independent department for international development (DfID) into the foreign office.",

      "bodyText": "Even now, with the benefit of distance, it is a remarkable detail of last season\u2019s Champions League final. Lucas Moura, the hat-trick hero of Tottenham\u2019s semi-final second-leg epic at Ajax, the man who wept tears of joy as he watched the replay of his 96th-minute winner, could make only the bench for the final against Liverpool. Football can be the cruellest of pursuits but how about this for a twist of the knife? The first that Lucas knew of his demotion \u2013 at the expense of the fit-again Harry Kane \u2013 was when Mauricio Pochettino announced the lineup at the team hotel. There had been no quiet word in advance from the manager, no sympathetic heads-up. \u201cHe didn\u2019t speak with me, he didn\u2019t explain anything but it\u2019s normal,\u201d Lucas says. \u201cHe chose and I need to respect. I needed to be ready to come on and play. To be honest, in the hotel when he gave the starting XI, I was a little bit sad. Of course, I would like to play but the most important thing was to win the game. The coach needs to choose 11 players, he can only choose 11 players and we need to respect. I don\u2019t have a problem with this. \u201cOf course, I was sad inside. I want to play. But I know how to understand, I know how to respect and I know how difficult it is for him to choose 11 players. So that\u2019s football. We need to be professional and keep working.\u201d Lucas did come on in the 66th minute as Spurs trailed 1-0 but there was to be no repeat of the fabled Amsterdam comeback.

Lucas headed the equaliser at Manchester City, 19 seconds after coming on as a substitute, to demonstrate further his knack of scoring in big away games. He was on target in the league last season at Manchester United and Liverpool while everyone remembers his vital Champions League equaliser at Barcelona \u2013 not to mention what happened against Ajax. Can Spurs really compete with City and Liverpool for the domestic title? \u201cIt will be so difficult, they are favourites but I think in football everything is possible \u2013 there is no invincible team,\u201d Lucas says. \u201cEverything can happen and we need to believe that. \u201cWe went to City and got a good result.

      "body": "<p>Every so often, the football world gets into a tizz about something fairly inconsequential. The game has gone, cry the doomsayers. Integrity has flown out of the window, moan the handwringers. Whether it be diving Premier League stars on obscene salaries, narcissistic referees who hog the limelight or cheating foreign coaches who spy on opponents, the nation\u2019s phone-ins are instantly inundated with calls from outraged fans.</p> <p>There was another moral panic on 17 August when the video assistant referee (VAR) ruled out a late winner for one of the world\u2019s richest clubs. This was the second week in a row that Manchester City had been caught up in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/17/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">VAR controversy</a>. The desiccated technology, one critic wailed, was killing football. \u201cIt\u2019s sparked criticism across Europe,\u201d weeped a website. \u201cSomething in the soul of the game,\u201d a broadsheet scribe wrote, gnashing his teeth, \u201cis lost.\u201d Former QPR coach Ian Holloway, somewhat predictably, blamed the EU.</p> <p>A nation yawned. Such first world problems do not really, as the never-knowingly low-key platforms of our breathless social media would have us believe, pose a threat to the game\u2019s spiritual wellbeing.</p> <p>The latest bother, however \u2013 about a small, unfashionable, lower-league football ground 14 miles from City\u2019s stunning stadium, and not much further from Old Trafford, the home of the world\u2019s third richest club, Manchester United \u2013 is another matter entirely. Last week was hellish for supporters of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2019/aug/23/bury-future-hangs-in-the-balance-weekend-football-countdown-live\" title=\"\">Bury FC</a>. At their modest Gigg Lane stadium, a coffin bore the legend \u201cRIP Bury\u201d. A former club director handcuffed herself to a drainpipe. Long-suffering fans of the 134-year-old club ripped up their season tickets outside the gates.</p> <p>On Saturday, the English Football League gave the club a reprieve until Tuesday at 5pm after Steve Dale \u2013 who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/13/bury-new-owner-steve-dale-financial-misery-historic-club\" title=\"\">bought the club for \u00a31</a> last December \u2013 agreed a sale. But the club faithful know the existential threat remains. The fact that one of the oldest teams in the country is on the brink of being wiped off the football map is a parable for our times. If doom-mongers want a symbol of the once-beautiful game\u2019s descent into ugliness, they should take the half-hour Metro ride from Manchester into Bury.</p> <p>This journey is a reminder of the chasm that has emerged between football\u2019s haves and have-nots. In the 1997-98 season, little Bury were in the same division as Manchester City, and famously beat them. Since 2008, City have been bankrolled by Abu Dhabi\u2019s Sheikh Mansour to the tune of \u00a31.3bn, and they are favourites to win the world\u2019s most lucrative league three times in a row.</p> <p>It is Bury\u2019s 12-point deduction for insolvency, the suspension of all their opening fixtures and banishment from a cup competition \u2013 rather than the slings and arrows of disputed offside, handball or penalty decisions in the avaricious Premier League \u2013 that exposes the moral vacuum at the heart of the modern game.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Dale has a track record of asset-selling: 43 of the 51 companies he has been linked with have been liquidated</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Bury fans know they aren\u2019t the only ones in dire straits. Blackpool, Coventry City, Port Vale, Oldham, Macclesfield Town and Bolton Wanderers have all spent time on life support, part of a roll call of English football\u2019s lost, post-industrial heartlands. Bolton even set up a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/14/bolton-wanderers-set-up-emergency-food-bank-to-help-unpaid-staff\" title=\"\">food bank for unpaid staff</a>. Manchester United, on the other hand, has more commercial partners than Bury has players.</p> <p>Bury\u2019s stay of execution does not alter the trend for the rich to get richer while the poor become more debt-ridden. Premier League clubs spent a total of \u00a31.3bn before the current season, half of them smashing their transfer records. By contrast, a quarter of EFL clubs have faced extinction in the past decade.</p> <p>Football is broken. It is crying out for a salary cap; Bury were unable to pay the hefty wages they owed the players who won them promotion to League One. An independent body should be established to run its own fit and proper persons test; incredibly, the EFL let Dale take over Bury without providing proof of funds.</p> <p>An honours board in the club remembers supporters \u201cwhose contribution marks them out, be it for their loyalty, sacrifice or endeavours\u201d. These are not qualities normally associated with opportunistic owners. Dale has a track record of asset-selling, and has been a director of more than 40 companies.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ManchesterEveningNews/posts/steve-dale-i-didnt-even-know-there-was-a-football-team-called-bury-to-be-honest-/10156719242602060/\" title=\"\">revealing interview</a> on 23 August, the Cheshire-based businessman said he \u201cdidn\u2019t even know there was a football team called Bury\u201d when he bought the club. He then admitted to not being a football fan. One suspects, however, he might have heard of Bury\u2019s noisy neighbours.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Every so often, the football world gets into a tizz about something fairly inconsequential. The game has gone, cry the doomsayers. Integrity has flown out of the window, moan the handwringers. Whether it be diving Premier League stars on obscene salaries, narcissistic referees who hog the limelight or cheating foreign coaches who spy on opponents, the nation\u2019s phone-ins are instantly inundated with calls from outraged fans. There was another moral panic on 17 August when the video assistant referee (VAR) ruled out a late winner for one of the world\u2019s richest clubs. This was the second week in a row that Manchester City had been caught up in a VAR controversy. The desiccated technology, one critic wailed, was killing football. \u201cIt\u2019s sparked criticism across Europe,\u201d weeped a website. \u201cSomething in the soul of the game,\u201d a broadsheet scribe wrote, gnashing his teeth, \u201cis lost.\u201d Former QPR coach Ian Holloway, somewhat predictably, blamed the EU. A nation yawned. Such first world problems do not really, as the never-knowingly low-key platforms of our breathless social media would have us believe, pose a threat to the game\u2019s spiritual wellbeing. The latest bother, however \u2013 about a small, unfashionable, lower-league football ground 14 miles from City\u2019s stunning stadium, and not much further from Old Trafford, the home of the world\u2019s third richest club, Manchester United \u2013 is another matter entirely. Last week was hellish for supporters of Bury FC. At their modest Gigg Lane stadium, a coffin bore the legend \u201cRIP Bury\u201d. A former club director handcuffed herself to a drainpipe. Long-suffering fans of the 134-year-old club ripped up their season tickets outside the gates. On Saturday, the English Football League gave the club a reprieve until Tuesday at 5pm after Steve Dale \u2013 who bought the club for \u00a31 last December \u2013 agreed a sale. But the club faithful know the existential threat remains. The fact that one of the oldest teams in the country is on the brink of being wiped off the football map is a parable for our times. If doom-mongers want a symbol of the once-beautiful game\u2019s descent into ugliness, they should take the half-hour Metro ride from Manchester into Bury. This journey is a reminder of the chasm that has emerged between football\u2019s haves and have-nots. In the 1997-98 season, little Bury were in the same division as Manchester City, and famously beat them. Since 2008, City have been bankrolled by Abu Dhabi\u2019s Sheikh Mansour to the tune of \u00a31.3bn, and they are favourites to win the world\u2019s most lucrative league three times in a row. It is Bury\u2019s 12-point deduction for insolvency, the suspension of all their opening fixtures and banishment from a cup competition \u2013 rather than the slings and arrows of disputed offside, handball or penalty decisions in the avaricious Premier League \u2013 that exposes the moral vacuum at the heart of the modern game. Bury fans know they aren\u2019t the only ones in dire straits. Blackpool, Coventry City, Port Vale, Oldham, Macclesfield Town and Bolton Wanderers have all spent time on life support, part of a roll call of English football\u2019s lost, post-industrial heartlands. Bolton even set up a food bank for unpaid staff. Manchester United, on the other hand, has more commercial partners than Bury has players. Bury\u2019s stay of execution does not alter the trend for the rich to get richer while the poor become more debt-ridden. Premier League clubs spent a total of \u00a31.3bn before the current season, half of them smashing their transfer records. By contrast, a quarter of EFL clubs have faced extinction in the past decade. Football is broken. It is crying out for a salary cap; Bury were unable to pay the hefty wages they owed the players who won them promotion to League One. An independent body should be established to run its own fit and proper persons test; incredibly, the EFL let Dale take over Bury without providing proof of funds. An honours board in the club remembers supporters \u201cwhose contribution marks them out, be it for their loyalty, sacrifice or endeavours\u201d. These are not qualities normally associated with opportunistic owners. Dale has a track record of asset-selling, and has been a director of more than 40 companies. In a revealing interview on 23 August, the Cheshire-based businessman said he \u201cdidn\u2019t even know there was a football team called Bury\u201d when he bought the club. He then admitted to not being a football fan. One suspects, however, he might have heard of Bury\u2019s noisy neighbours.",

It\u2019s a fun haircut to have and it\u2019s only going to get more popular.\u201d</p> <p>Peckham-based hairdresser Jackson Acton added: \u201cYou can\u2019t go wrong with a mullet.

Tina Outen, a stylist used by <em>Vogue</em> and <em>i-D</em> magazine, believes the cut can be cool and also political; a statement of androgyny. \u201cThere is a sense of freedom in the fashion industry and we are in an era of playfulness,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople can be who they want to be.\u201d</p> <p>Celebrity hairdresser Charlie Le Mindu agreed. \u201cIt works for every gender. We are seeing it a lot on the streets,\u201d he said. Domingos added: \u201cIt allows scope for all genders, non-genders and binaries.\u201d</p> <p>Dominic Johnson, reader in performance and visual culture at Queen Mary University of London, said the reasons for the hairdo\u2019s revival was in part political. \u201cIt sounds silly but it\u2019s tied to a longer tradition of using whatever means are available, whether that\u2019s a haircut or wearing lipstick, or changing the way you use language, in order to attach to a particular identity,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Another explanation is that the mullet, mocked by many, is a protest against conventional beauty. According to Caryn Franklin, fashion commentator and professor at Kingston School of Art, the new-wave mullet is a backlash against the high-maintenance, long-haired looks that have dominated portrayals of femininity in mainstream advertising. \u201cHair styling has always allowed for non-conformist statements,\u201d she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c6f558100d8d7f19e86a48699f1f42d1a0892d32\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c6f558100d8d7f19e86a48699f1f42d1a0892d32/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Step Mullets from Vacancy Project and Diego Maradona in 1985.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Step Mullets from Vacancy Project and Diego Maradona in 1985.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Vacancy Project and Stefano Montesi/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Social media has also helped spread the word.

      "bodyText": "David Bowie\u2019s Ziggy Stardust wore his cascading down his neck, Andre Agassi kept his in check with a headband. Patti Smith\u2019s, meanwhile, was pure \u201cbusiness in the front, party in the back\u201d. Mullets were everywhere in the 1970s and 80s, and now \u2013 perhaps to the surprise and consternation of many \u2013 they are back. Partly inspired by the hit TV series Stranger Things and the \u201c1980s footballer\u201d look showcased to perfection in the recent documentary Diego Maradona, the hairdo has been reinvented for the 21st century as a statement of gender fluidity and cool. \u201cMine\u2019s a combination of George Michael and Ian Botham,\u201d said Tom Watson, 20, who regards the look as classic. \u201cA lot of my social group have them. It started off as a joke but it won\u2019t die.\u201d Idalina Domingos, a 24-year-old hairdresser who works at a salon in London, got her shaggy version a year ago. \u201cI cut at least one or two a week,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are these modern mullets, people are coming round to the idea. It\u2019s a fun haircut to have and it\u2019s only going to get more popular.\u201d Peckham-based hairdresser Jackson Acton added: \u201cYou can\u2019t go wrong with a mullet. I\u2019ve done a lot of them in the last year for both girls and guys.\u201d Mullets have been big on catwalks and the red carpet for a while and the trend is now hitting the high street. Tina Outen, a stylist used by Vogue and i-D magazine, believes the cut can be cool and also political; a statement of androgyny. \u201cThere is a sense of freedom in the fashion industry and we are in an era of playfulness,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople can be who they want to be.\u201d Celebrity hairdresser Charlie Le Mindu agreed. \u201cIt works for every gender. We are seeing it a lot on the streets,\u201d he said. Domingos added: \u201cIt allows scope for all genders, non-genders and binaries.\u201d Dominic Johnson, reader in performance and visual culture at Queen Mary University of London, said the reasons for the hairdo\u2019s revival was in part political. \u201cIt sounds silly but it\u2019s tied to a longer tradition of using whatever means are available, whether that\u2019s a haircut or wearing lipstick, or changing the way you use language, in order to attach to a particular identity,\u201d he said. Another explanation is that the mullet, mocked by many, is a protest against conventional beauty. According to Caryn Franklin, fashion commentator and professor at Kingston School of Art, the new-wave mullet is a backlash against the high-maintenance, long-haired looks that have dominated portrayals of femininity in mainstream advertising. \u201cHair styling has always allowed for non-conformist statements,\u201d she said. Social media has also helped spread the word. Hair salons and influencers with big online followings, such as Vacancy Project in New York and Portland\u2019s Bree Ritter, even have their own signature cuts. So how should you style it? According to Teen Vogue, the step mullet is the trendiest version. Like staircase steps, the style \u2013 featuring hair cut at different tiers \u2013 stems from the DIY idea of cutting your hair with kitchen scissors. It can also be worn in a practical way. \u201cYou can wear it tied back and you\u2019ve a short, choppy haircut,\u201d said Outen. Le Mindu recommends wearing it straight at the back. \u201cI like it geometric and crazy,\u201d he said.However it is styled, the trend looks set to stay. \u201cYou\u2019ll see more of it,\u201d said Acton. \u201cTen years ago, short on the sides and long on top was taboo. Now you see it on guys in suits and on Love Island. I think the mullet will be like that soon.\u201d",

After a handful of one-day caps in his early 20s he admits he went missing in county cricket and overcame a crippling run of poor form only when he stopped craving an England return so badly. On the eve of this series, when others might be hyped up with adrenaline, the 33-year-old could scarcely have been more Zen. He spoke calmly of the good fortune by which he was getting this late stab at Ashes cricket, a determination to enjoy the ride come rain or shine and the experience he hoped to bring as a senior pro. Nevertheless Denly cannot have been impervious to the chat surrounding his position since first being called up for the winter tour to Sri Lanka and then earning a debut in the Caribbean in January. No England cricketer in recent times has so obviously been the pick of one selector \u2013 in his case a former Kent teammate, and now convener of the panel, Ed Smith. Even before this third Test Trevor Bayliss was betraying a touch of uncertainty about Denly when he suggested Jason Roy may be better suited down the order. It was clear who the head coach fancied in the plum spot away from the new ball, despite neither man having pulled up many trees. And so with one half-century from 10 innings to his name before this match \u2013 69 in St Lucia that booked his continuation through to the summer - and a near-miss with the World Cup squad after Bayliss and Eoin Morgan lobbied for Liam Dawson at the 11th hour, Denly could have been forgiven for feeling a bit of an outsider. It is not often the top-scorer in an innings attracts a fair chunk of the heat but when the total is 67 and the top score is 12, all bets are off. Denly had faced 49 balls during England\u2019s Ashes-blowing blow-out on day two, edging seven and missing a further 16. With white-ball success having fed into his original England chance \u2013 as opposed to outright first-class dominance \u2013 and an expansive drive his downfall amid the meltdown, Denly was beginning to sum up the team\u2019s issues as a whole. Yet on day three at Headingley, perhaps in a similar vein to the reduced expectations that saw him overcome a mid-career slump at Middlesex, Denly produced a performance that should earn him at least one more Test; another hint at the \u201ctouch of class in his DNA\u201d that Smith lauded on first picking him. It started in the morning, when Denly\u2019s initial fumble at third man talked Marnus Labuschagne into a second run, only for a lasered throw to Jonny Bairstow at the stumps to prise Australia\u2019s new limpet from his rock. It may seem a little thing with England\u2019s predicament so forlorn but being swamped by his teammates will have provided an early confidence boost. Did this bleed into the batting that followed? Arriving at the crease with the score 15 for two and Roy having been dispatched by a pearler from Pat Cummins, there were times early on in Denly\u2019s innings where one wondered if the lessons of Black Friday had really been learned. As well as wearing one on the helmet from Cummins early in the piece \u2013 and getting into some awkward positions against the short ball generally \u2013 there were a number of whooshing drives at fresh air that suggested England\u2019s long-held desire to go hard at width will not be reprogrammed overnight. But slowly Denly began to find his tempo, feeding off Joe Root\u2019s growing assuredness at the other end in a stand of 136 that has given England a puncher\u2019s chance of a Headingley miracle. Where runs first came off Denly\u2019s edge, as the balls ticked over they started to come via the middle. A lofted drive off Nathan Lyon here, a pull off Josh Hazlewood there - who knew that Test batting gets easier the more time you spend out there?

Perhaps the plan was to keep the Brazilian so busy he could not be distracted by thoughts of glorious sallies upfield, to sit so deep that he didn\u2019t have to think territorially \u2013 something Mark Schwarzer, his former teammate at Chelsea, had highlighted as a vulnerability earlier in the week \u2013 but could keep fighting the duels he relishes.</p> <p>Arsenal held out for longer than they had in any Anfield game since their 2-2 draw here in 2014, but the sense was always that they would crack. A second away clean sheet of the season, exceeding last season\u2019s total by the end of August, never seemed plausible. Eventually a cross, especially against a team with the quality of delivery of Liverpool, is going to meet a forehead and sure enough one did, shortly before half-time. Jo\u00ebl Matip\u2019s opener came from a right-wing corner, the 22nd cross Liverpool had mustered in the opening 41 minutes, the 19th from a full-back and the 12th from Alexander-Arnold.</p> <p>The lesson, it is fair to say, was not learned. Arsenal emerged for the second half in the same shape and within three minutes had conceded again. Alexander-Arnold was again left absurdly isolated perhaps 10 yards outside the box and had time to measure his pass in to Roberto Firmino. A sharp pass round the corner set Salah behind David Luiz, but not far enough behind that the Brazilian could not grab his shirt and concede a penalty.</p> <p>David Luiz is a curious player, one whose gifts and flaws are both vast and manifest. The glee with which his signing was greeted at the Emirates was at least partly born of the realisation that his presence meant the end for Shkodran Mustafi, whose confidence by the close of last season was almost as fractured as his relationship with the supporters. But those who had doubts would not have been reassured here.</p> <p>Perhaps his performance was nothing unexpected: a midfielder converted into a third centre-back as a 17-year-old at Vit\u00f3ria in Salvador, he has never looked comfortable in a pair. His tendency has always been to charge out in search of the ball, and it was that fault that brought the third. It was not so much the ease with which Salah skipped by him that provoked concern as the fact he did it out on the left touchline about 10 yards inside his own half.</p> <p>Arsenal\u2019s pre-season optimism need not be extinguished entirely but this was a chastening lesson in where they currently stand. At least the trip to Anfield is over early this year.</p>",

Arsenal held out for longer than they had in any Anfield game since their 2-2 draw here in 2014, but the sense was always that they would crack. A second away clean sheet of the season, exceeding last season\u2019s total by the end of August, never seemed plausible. Eventually a cross, especially against a team with the quality of delivery of Liverpool, is going to meet a forehead and sure enough one did, shortly before half-time. Jo\u00ebl Matip\u2019s opener came from a right-wing corner, the 22nd cross Liverpool had mustered in the opening 41 minutes, the 19th from a full-back and the 12th from Alexander-Arnold. The lesson, it is fair to say, was not learned. Arsenal emerged for the second half in the same shape and within three minutes had conceded again. Alexander-Arnold was again left absurdly isolated perhaps 10 yards outside the box and had time to measure his pass in to Roberto Firmino. A sharp pass round the corner set Salah behind David Luiz, but not far enough behind that the Brazilian could not grab his shirt and concede a penalty. David Luiz is a curious player, one whose gifts and flaws are both vast and manifest. The glee with which his signing was greeted at the Emirates was at least partly born of the realisation that his presence meant the end for Shkodran Mustafi, whose confidence by the close of last season was almost as fractured as his relationship with the supporters. But those who had doubts would not have been reassured here. Perhaps his performance was nothing unexpected: a midfielder converted into a third centre-back as a 17-year-old at Vit\u00f3ria in Salvador, he has never looked comfortable in a pair. His tendency has always been to charge out in search of the ball, and it was that fault that brought the third. It was not so much the ease with which Salah skipped by him that provoked concern as the fact he did it out on the left touchline about 10 yards inside his own half. Arsenal\u2019s pre-season optimism need not be extinguished entirely but this was a chastening lesson in where they currently stand. At least the trip to Anfield is over early this year.",

      "body": "<p>In a beer garden in central London last Tuesday the atmosphere was relaxed. But not for Mike. Every few minutes he would turn to scrutinise the people around him. When you have infiltrated a group like the far-right Generation Identity UK, paranoia comes easily.</p> <p>Anti-racist groups have been trying to infiltrate the Identitarian movement\u2019s British branch for years without success \u2013 until now. Earlier this year Mike began posting Facebook messages expressing outrage over \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/07/christchurch-mosque-killer-ideas-mainstream-social-media\" title=\"\">the great replacement</a>\u201d \u2013 the conspiracy theory that claims white people are being wiped out through mass migration. Soon after, following the Christchurch massacre in New Zealand by an Identitarian supporter in March, members of the group invited him to join.</p> <p>On Sunday the <em>Observer</em> reveals the results of his undercover mission, which was abruptly halted by the startling discovery that two Royal Navy personnel \u2013 one of them due to serve on a Trident nuclear submarine \u2013 were members of the group. He and anti-racist campaign <a href=\"https://www.hopenothate.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Hope Not Hate</a> gained unprecedented access to the movement\u2019s social media operation, and exposed the even more disturbing and extreme views being adopted by the far-right group.</p> <p>Mike said: \u201cIt was clear that the UK branch appeared to be more open to things like antisemitism than its European counterparts would want.\u201d</p> <p>Mike began copying messages from the group\u2019s leaders on the encrypted messaging app Telegram. Generation Identity\u2019s leaders like to present themselves as clean-cut, but the messages \u2013 seen by the <em>Observer</em> \u2013 expose connections to extremists.</p> <p>One is a former British National Party official and neo-Nazi called Mark Collett, who has tweeted that a \u201cwhite genocide\u201d is under way in Britain. Another is Swedish activist Daniel Friberg, a co-founder of the AltRight Corporation, formed through the merger of the National Policy Institute, run by American white supremacist Richard Spencer, and an antisemitic Scandinavian media platform.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aeb1193a7977bdb0347db6a6b039584fdb0b4718\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aeb1193a7977bdb0347db6a6b039584fdb0b4718/6_346_5382_3228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Free Tommy Robinson rally\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Free Tommy Robinson rally in Whitehall in June 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Chattle/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Expressions of casual racism were regularly shared by Generation Identity UK members. One Telegram message, commenting on the number of Muslim women in Ealing, says: \u201cTGR [the great replacement] is being rolled out in West London.\u201d</p> <p>Other messages show members wanting to connect with antisemites and downplaying statements from a virulent \u201cJQer,\u201d a far-right reference to what they term the Jewish question.</p> <p>This drift even further to the extremes appears to have been noted by Martin Sellner, the movement\u2019s Austrian leader. When the UK branch decided to allow an antisemite vlogger, Colin Robertson, known on YouTube as Millennial Woes, to address its annual conference last month, Sellner expelled the group from the wider movement.</p> <p>Some British members also left in disgust. One wrote: \u201cWe are trying to get totally away from the shadow of the Old Right. We don\u2019t do that by getting a JQer to speak at our conference.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We will be left with a smaller but more toxic group in the UK, open to the more dangerous elements of the far right</p> <footer> <cite>Simon Murdoch, Hope Not Hate</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Mike quickly learned how the group operated. Its leadership created fake Twitter accounts to write positive replies to their own tweets. New members were recruited by \u201cpatriotic\u201d Facebook pages that failed to mention they were run by Generation Identity. Ukip chatrooms were infiltrated. A strategy document called \u201ccampaign outreach\u201d listed extremists like Collett as people they should contact to amplify their message.</p> <p>Others included the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/20/donald-trump-sadiq-khan-katie-hopkins-tweet\" title=\"\">commentator Katie Hopkins</a> and Paul Joseph Watson, an editor at the far-right <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/05/antisemitism-row-ukip-accused-over-links-with-us-far-right-website-infowars\" title=\"\">conspiracy theory website</a> Infowars.</p> <p>In some messages Generation Identity UK\u2019s leadership described their group as a \u201cwater-tight metapolitical project\u201d, their ambition not to win political power but to shape public debate, promoting ethno-nationalist ideas, and their goal the ethnic cleansing of Europe.</p> <p>Traditional far-right discussion of race and genetics is replaced by the language of culture and identity.

      "bodyText": "In a beer garden in central London last Tuesday the atmosphere was relaxed. But not for Mike. Every few minutes he would turn to scrutinise the people around him. When you have infiltrated a group like the far-right Generation Identity UK, paranoia comes easily. Anti-racist groups have been trying to infiltrate the Identitarian movement\u2019s British branch for years without success \u2013 until now. Earlier this year Mike began posting Facebook messages expressing outrage over \u201cthe great replacement\u201d \u2013 the conspiracy theory that claims white people are being wiped out through mass migration. Soon after, following the Christchurch massacre in New Zealand by an Identitarian supporter in March, members of the group invited him to join. On Sunday the Observer reveals the results of his undercover mission, which was abruptly halted by the startling discovery that two Royal Navy personnel \u2013 one of them due to serve on a Trident nuclear submarine \u2013 were members of the group. He and anti-racist campaign Hope Not Hate gained unprecedented access to the movement\u2019s social media operation, and exposed the even more disturbing and extreme views being adopted by the far-right group. Mike said: \u201cIt was clear that the UK branch appeared to be more open to things like antisemitism than its European counterparts would want.\u201d Mike began copying messages from the group\u2019s leaders on the encrypted messaging app Telegram. Generation Identity\u2019s leaders like to present themselves as clean-cut, but the messages \u2013 seen by the Observer \u2013 expose connections to extremists. One is a former British National Party official and neo-Nazi called Mark Collett, who has tweeted that a \u201cwhite genocide\u201d is under way in Britain. Another is Swedish activist Daniel Friberg, a co-founder of the AltRight Corporation, formed through the merger of the National Policy Institute, run by American white supremacist Richard Spencer, and an antisemitic Scandinavian media platform. Expressions of casual racism were regularly shared by Generation Identity UK members. One Telegram message, commenting on the number of Muslim women in Ealing, says: \u201cTGR [the great replacement] is being rolled out in West London.\u201d Other messages show members wanting to connect with antisemites and downplaying statements from a virulent \u201cJQer,\u201d a far-right reference to what they term the Jewish question. This drift even further to the extremes appears to have been noted by Martin Sellner, the movement\u2019s Austrian leader. When the UK branch decided to allow an antisemite vlogger, Colin Robertson, known on YouTube as Millennial Woes, to address its annual conference last month, Sellner expelled the group from the wider movement. Some British members also left in disgust. One wrote: \u201cWe are trying to get totally away from the shadow of the Old Right. We don\u2019t do that by getting a JQer to speak at our conference.\u201d Mike quickly learned how the group operated. Its leadership created fake Twitter accounts to write positive replies to their own tweets. New members were recruited by \u201cpatriotic\u201d Facebook pages that failed to mention they were run by Generation Identity. Ukip chatrooms were infiltrated. A strategy document called \u201ccampaign outreach\u201d listed extremists like Collett as people they should contact to amplify their message. Others included the commentator Katie Hopkins and Paul Joseph Watson, an editor at the far-right conspiracy theory website Infowars. In some messages Generation Identity UK\u2019s leadership described their group as a \u201cwater-tight metapolitical project\u201d, their ambition not to win political power but to shape public debate, promoting ethno-nationalist ideas, and their goal the ethnic cleansing of Europe. Traditional far-right discussion of race and genetics is replaced by the language of culture and identity. One member wrote: \u201cPushing cultural differences is a more subtle way of implying that there\u2019s very real differences between the people who were originally here and the people who are coming here.\u201d The disclosures coincide with a new report by Hope not Hate revealing that Identitarian groups are active in at least 23 countries, making it \u201cone of the most dangerous far-right networks currently active\u201d. Researchers have previously found that 30,000 people are members of Identitarian Telegram groups with 140,000 subscribers on YouTube.

Having originated with the Nouvelle Droite (New Right) that emerged in 1968, Generation Identity has retained extensive links with the electoral French far right, particularly Marine Le Pen\u2019s Rassemblement National (National Rally). Austria is another major player: its Generation Identity branch, led by Sellner, has nearly 17,000 Twitter followers. Police have revealed that the Christchurch mosque killer, who took the lives of 51 people, had donated \u20ac2,000 and \u20ac1,500 to the movement\u2019s French and Austrian branches respectively. On 19 August, Austria\u2019s centre-right People\u2019s party announced it wanted to ban the Identitarians. Identitarianism is also influential among the US far right with support from Breitbart news, alt-right figures like Spencer and the neo-Nazi website, the Daily Stormer. The American Identity Movement site claims it is \u201cdefending our nation against mass immigration\u201d. In the UK, the movement\u2019s expulsion from Europe has prompted warnings that it could become more dangerous. Simon Murdoch, Identitarianism researcher at Hope Not Hate, said: \u201cEvidence suggests we will be left with a smaller but more toxic group in the UK, open to engagement with the more antisemitic, extreme and thus dangerous elements of the domestic far right.\u201d Already a possible alliance with the For Britain political party suggests a new chapter. Ann Marie Waters, For Britain\u2019s leader, addressed the recent Generation Identity conference in London, in a speech billed by supporters as the first \u201cgreat replacement\u201d speech by a UK politician. Many, including Mike, are worried. \u201cAnti-Islam is now seen as boring; it\u2019s moving on to \u2018white genocide\u2019, the replacement of whites\u201d he said. \u201cThe trajectory is ominous.\u201d Generation Identitarian in the UK claims to be non-violent and there is no suggestion that they have been responsible for any violent acts. Internationally, groups using the GI tag have been active since the 1960s. 1968 The far-right Nouvelle Droite (ND) is formed in France. Early 2000s G\u00e9n\u00e9ration Identitaire, a rightwing extremist group drawing on ND beliefs, is launched. 2010 French writer Renaud Camus, coins the phrase \u201cgreat replacement\u201d. 2012 Austrian alt-right activist Martin Sellner founds Identit\u00e4re Bewegung \u00d6sterreichs (IB\u00d6), a group opposed to liberalism, multiculturalism and Islam. 2016 IB\u00d6 members storm a stage in an Austrian university where a play is being performed by refugee actors. 2017 Sellner raises more than \u00a370,000 to sail a ship into the Mediterranean targeting boats helping migrants and refugees. 2018 Sellner visits Luton, insults Muslims with provocative slogans and is banned from the UK.

      "bodyText": "Two members of the Royal Navy, including one who is due to start work on a Trident nuclear submarine, are members of a far-right group with links to a banned terrorist organisation, the Observer can reveal. An undercover informant, who infiltrated the UK branch of the pan-European Identitarian Movement and had access to thousands of internal messages, met a Royal Navy sailor who revealed that he was about to take up a posting on a submarine armed with Trident nuclear missiles. The meeting, involving an informant for anti-fascist group Hope Not Hate, took place at the annual conference of Generation Identity UK in London on 27 July. The Identitarian Movement, which is fiercely opposed to mass migration, has expanded rapidly in the past two years and has at least 63 \u201cregional branches\u201d of varying sizes across Europe. The \u201cgreat replacement\u201d theory was cited as motivation by the mass shooters in the Christchurch mosque attacks, which killed 51 people in March, and the massacre in El Paso, Texas, earlier this month, in which 22 people died. There is no suggestion that GI UK endorses or supports violence. Last night the identities of the naval recruit and another GI member serving at the same base were sent to the MoD, which issued a statement saying: \u201cAny extremist ideology is completely at odds with our values.\u201d The infiltration, coordinated by Hope not Hate, was abruptly terminated after the group\u2019s alleged links to Britain\u2019s nuclear submarine fleet were discovered. \u201cWhen we realised far-right activists from a group whose stated goal is the ethnic cleansing of Europe were in the navy, we decided to sound the alarm,\u201d said the informant, who has shared the entire cache of internal messages and planning documents of the identitarian group. The messages show that Generation Identity UK was expelled by the movement\u2019s pan-European network for inviting an antisemite to its recent conference and is now preparing to merge with far-right party For Britain, run by Anne Marie Waters. Prominent supporters of Waters include jailed anti-Islam activist Tommy Robinson. The revelation that the far right has a presence in the armed forces follows the widespread outcry last year when Robinson posed for a photograph alongside a group of military figures. The informant, whose identity is being withheld by the Observer, added that the recruit he met at last month\u2019s second-ever UK conference of Generation Identity, held in south Kensington, alleged that his membership of GI was widely known in the service. \u201cHe says the navy knows he is a member of GI. He claims all the officers are racist,\u201d said the informant, who spent five months inside the group and officially left it as the Observer went to press. Simon Murdoch, identitarianism researcher at Hope Not Hate, said: \u201cThe idea that individuals who subscribe to the dangerous far-right ideology that influenced the Christchurch killer are serving members of the Royal Navy, and that one claims to be taking up a job on a nuclear submarine, is completely unacceptable and actually quite terrifying. We simply cannot allow this dangerous ideology to gain any traction within our armed forces.\u201d A YouTuber who had links to National Action before it was proscribed as a terrorist group by the Home Office in 2016, spoke at last month\u2019s London conference, although the speech was not recorded, at the organisers\u2019 request. The informant claimed the speaker had also invited two National Front members who were also former members of National Action and were identified by a GI regional leader. Previously, Jacob Bewick, an activist with GI, had been exposed as a member of National Action and was spotted at an NA march in 2016. At the conference, one GI UK member told the informant that two members of the fascist National Front were also believed to be former National Action recruits. While Generation Identity UK disavows violence and neo-Nazism, internal correspondence, sent on encrypted messaging app Telegram, reveals racism and antisemitism. They show that the UK branch has been expelled from Europe\u2019s large identitarian network after recently inviting antisemitic white supremacist Colin Robertson \u2013 aka Millennial Woes \u2013 from West Lothian to its conference last month. Martin Sellner, the Austrian leader of Europe\u2019s Generation Identity movement, wrote to fellow leaders, that he would \u201cdisavow the English movement publicly and declare that it is no longer part of GI, demanding to change its name and branding\u201d after its unauthorised invite to \u201calt-right YouTubers, whose positions do not represent us\u201d. Robertson has described himself as \u201cpro-slavery\u201d and called for the torpedoing of refugee boats. In June, Sellner himself was permanently excluded from entering the UK by the Home Office, which assessed that the 30-year-old posed a serious threat to the UK\u2019s interests of preventing social harm and countering extremism. Another speaker at the conference was Waters, who has described Islam as \u201cevil\u201d and has attracted 34,000 Facebook followers to her group. Last night, an MoD spokesperson said: \u201cIt would be inappropriate to comment specifically on these allegations. We take allegations of this nature very seriously and would always carry out investigations into such matters when they are made against service personnel.\u201d",

It is not the first he has played at Headingley. Back in the spring of 2013 Root made his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/may/10/joe-root-england-lions-new-zealand\" title=\"\">very first Test century</a> here, 104 against New Zealand. He was 22 then, but so baby-faced that he was asked for ID every time he tried to buy a pint. If he looked young for 22 then, he looks old for 28 now. The England captaincy will do that. Back at the start of the Test summer Root said he would be lying if he denied he was feeling tired, and there was no point trying to kid the press anyway, since the black bags and crows feet gave him away.</p> <p>Root has played a lot of international cricket in the last six years: 320 innings altogether \u2013 more than any other player \u2013 and he has faced almost 20,000 balls, nearly a quarter as many again as two of the four other great batsmen of this generation, Kane Williamson and Steve Smith. Virat Kohli is the only one who gets close. Right now, Root is the only one of the four whose Test average has fallen below the fifty watershed. It falls all the way from 53 to 42 when he has been captain.

He surely did not get much sleep on Friday night. He has spoken before about how he often finds himself lying awake at night during games, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/23/england-australia-third-ashes-test-day-two-match-report\" title=\"\">what happened on Friday</a> left him plenty to stew on. He has looked as if he has been running on empty since Edgbaston, when he gave all of himself in that first innings of the series, batting three hours for 57 runs. But since then he has made 28, 14, 0 and 0, the first time in his life he has made ducks in back-to-back matches. He is in the thick of the worst year of his career. He was averaging 27 from 13 innings when he came in here.</p> <p>England were reeling at the time, too, at 15 for two. He was on a pair and Josh Hazlewood thought he had him with his second ball, which landed, of course, on a length outside off-stump. Root leaned into it and it whizzed just by the edge of his bat, which had clipped his pad. Hazlewood mistook the one noise for the other, and launched into a long, loud appeal, which umpire Gaffaney refused. Two balls later Root played a jittery little squirt through the slips that skittered away to third man for three runs. He bounded gleefully down the pitch for those first runs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/24/steve-smith-australia-debyshire-nets-headingley-england\">Steve Smith to play for Australia against Derbyshire after returning to nets</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Root set himself, then, for the grim and serious business of batting through the afternoon. He scored two fours in the next 23 overs, both of them off the outside edge, one wide through gully off Hazlewood, the other past slip off James Pattinson, who mistakenly thought he had him lbw later in the innings, too.

      "body": "<p>With that collective wit for which football fans are justly renowned, the Spurs contingent at the Etihad Stadium broke into song last weekend when Manchester City\u2019s winning goal was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/17/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">ruled out in the last minute</a>. \u201cVAR, my lord, VAR,\u201d they chanted, to the tune of Kumbaya, as the video assistant referee scrubbed out Gabriel Jesus\u2019s dramatic clincher, adjudging Aymeric Laporte to have handled the ball with the most glancing of touches. It was a case of Jesus being thwarted by a higher authority.</p> <p>But if Spurs fans saw VAR as a kind of divine intervention, a <em>deus ex machina</em> worthy of devotional praise, many other observers espied the work of the devil. The <em>Match of the Day</em> pundit Danny Murphy wrote that it \u201cspoiled the end of a great game\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/21/var-premier-league-sponsor-chief-executive\">Already loving VAR? Wait until the Premier League finds a sponsor for it | Marina Hyde</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His comments echoed those made by the Wolves manager, Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo, who, after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/11/leicester-wolves-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">similar incident against Leicester</a>, argued that such delayed decisions were \u201cnot good for atmosphere\u201d. To \u201ccelebrate a non-goal\u201d, he noted, was not in \u201cthe spirit of the game\u201d.</p> <p>There was much talk about a loss of atmosphere, and the threat of goalscoring becoming a provisional experience, dependent on prolonged external review for confirmation. And Ian Holloway seemed to view the disallowing of City\u2019s goal as evidence that the UK needed a swift Brexit, \u201cbecause you cannot have someone telling us how to do our own game\u201d, though he later insisted that what he really meant was that the combination of a new handball law and VAR was an injustice analogous to remaining in the EU in contravention of the popular vote \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/21/eu-to-blame-football-new-handball-rule-ian-holloway\" title=\"\">or something like that</a>.</p> <p>To all of which, the only sensible response is calm down. Let\u2019s remind ourselves why we now have VAR. It arrived after many years of flagrant refereeing errors being repeatedly exposed in slow-motion on TV. Cast your mind back to the second leg of the World Cup qualifying play-off between France and Ireland at the Stade de France in 2009. In extra time <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/nov/20/thierry-henry-ireland-world-cup\" title=\"\">Thierry Henry controls a long free-kick with his hand</a>, guiding the ball twice with his palm, before crossing to William Gallas to score the goal that knocked a furious Republic of Ireland out of the 2010 World Cup.</p> <p>It was against the spirit of the game, the watching world agreed \u2013 all, that is, except the French fans inside the stadium, who celebrated like mad. The Irish players ran after the referee vainly trying to get him to overrule his myopic decision. They didn\u2019t think: \u2018Oh, but what will that do to the atmosphere?\u2019 They weren\u2019t worried about the possibility of interrupting the jubilation of the home fans.</p> <p>But let\u2019s recall what happened when an over\u2011sensitivity to home fans\u2019 emotions affected referees\u2019 performances. Every travelling supporter can wax hysterical about shocking examples of \u201chomer\u201d officials, who have been a little too attuned to the majority sentiments of a crowd. Perhaps away fans are simply grievance-ridden (in spite of statistical evidence strongly suggesting referees favour home teams), and are more likely to feel embattled and neglected.</p> <p>So let\u2019s take a more neutral example: the 2002 World Cup, which was held jointly in South Korea and Japan. Remember the World Cup is the pinnacle of football, the spectacle watched by billions that showcases the very best, the elite level to which all players and officials aspire, and an example to the rest of football.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d249301355fe21b54c93cf440c75e622936fe38\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d249301355fe21b54c93cf440c75e622936fe38/0_0_2048_1804/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The South Korea players point to Francesco Totti after the Italy striker fell in the penalty box.

He duly received a second yellow card for diving.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lee Jae Won/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In that World Cup South Korea, supported by their passionate fans, played Spain in the quarter-final. South Korea lost 3-0. Except, in reality, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/jun/23/worldcupfootball2002.sport9\" title=\"\">South Korea won on penalties</a>, because all three Spanish goals, demonstrably legitimate, were ruled out, the first by Gamal Ghandour, the Egyptian referee, for obscure reasons, the second wrongly adjudged offside and the third ruled out because the ball \u2013 clearly still in \u2013 was said to have crossed the dead-ball line before Fernando Morientes headed it in. Many other decisions went against Spain in that match, which was roundly denounced as a scandal.</p> <p>However, it was almost a model of fair play by comparison with the previous Korea match, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/01/world-cup-25-stunning-moments-italy-south-korea\" title=\"\">against Italy in the second round</a>. Within three minutes of the start, the Ecuadorian referee Byron Moreno awarded a penalty to Korea, when Seol Ki-hyeon fell mysteriously in the Italian penalty area. Fortunately Gianluigi Buffon saved the resulting kick.</p> <p>Moreno went on to make a serious of extraordinary decisions, almost all of them in Korea\u2019s favour. Paolo Maldini was kicked in the head and Alessandro Del Piero was elbowed in the face, without any punishment to the Koreans inflicting the damage. Then Francesco Totti, on a yellow card, was sent off after being booked for diving, though he was clearly tripped. And in extra time Damiano Tommasi had an obviously legitimate goal bizarrely ruled out for offside.</p> <p>In both matches the Korean fans were ecstatic after the perverse rulings. Can you just imagine how unspeakably unkind it would have been to curtail their celebrations by overturning these egregious refereeing errors? Forget the disappointment of the Italy and Spain players, who had been working their whole careers to reach this stage, and think of the unbearable deflation of those joyful fans. Because apparently preventing that feeling is the spirit of football.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2019/aug/20/david-squires-on-handball-and-the-premier-league\">David Squires on \u2026 handball and the Premier League</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Incidentally, though South Korea enjoyed an abundance of refereeing favours, no one would suggest there was any skulduggery or corruption involved. These things happen, after all. And only cynics would look at the fact that Moreno was later imprisoned for heroin trafficking as any kind of reflection on his moral standing or professional reliability.</p> <p>Yes, VAR could be speeded up \u2013 and doubtless will be as practitioners adjust to its demands \u2013 and, yes, there is an argument that the new handball law is too stringent and requires a little thoughtful reform. But it\u2019s madness to confuse these separate issues with the emotional requirements of a celebrating crowd.</p> <p>The overwhelming majority of goals scored this season have been subject to no noticeable review and their accompanying celebrations have not been remotely hindered. And while it was a tad unfortunate for the City fans that their ecstasy was rudely stopped, just as had happened in the last minute of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/apr/17/manchester-city-tottenham-hotspur-champions-league-quarter-final-second-leg-match-report\" title=\"\">last season\u2019s Champions League quarter-final</a> against the same opposition, think for a moment of the unconfined joy and relief experienced by the travelling Spurs fans. Are they any less deserving of their emotions?</p> <p>Vertiginous highs and crushing lows. Or as the old spiritual goes: Someone\u2019s laughing, Lord, kumbaya. Someone\u2019s crying, Lord, kumbaya. <em>That</em>\u2019s the spirit of football, and long may it last.</p>",

      "bodyText": "With that collective wit for which football fans are justly renowned, the Spurs contingent at the Etihad Stadium broke into song last weekend when Manchester City\u2019s winning goal was ruled out in the last minute. \u201cVAR, my lord, VAR,\u201d they chanted, to the tune of Kumbaya, as the video assistant referee scrubbed out Gabriel Jesus\u2019s dramatic clincher, adjudging Aymeric Laporte to have handled the ball with the most glancing of touches. It was a case of Jesus being thwarted by a higher authority. But if Spurs fans saw VAR as a kind of divine intervention, a deus ex machina worthy of devotional praise, many other observers espied the work of the devil. The Match of the Day pundit Danny Murphy wrote that it \u201cspoiled the end of a great game\u201d. His comments echoed those made by the Wolves manager, Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo, who, after a similar incident against Leicester, argued that such delayed decisions were \u201cnot good for atmosphere\u201d. To \u201ccelebrate a non-goal\u201d, he noted, was not in \u201cthe spirit of the game\u201d. There was much talk about a loss of atmosphere, and the threat of goalscoring becoming a provisional experience, dependent on prolonged external review for confirmation. And Ian Holloway seemed to view the disallowing of City\u2019s goal as evidence that the UK needed a swift Brexit, \u201cbecause you cannot have someone telling us how to do our own game\u201d, though he later insisted that what he really meant was that the combination of a new handball law and VAR was an injustice analogous to remaining in the EU in contravention of the popular vote \u2013 or something like that. To all of which, the only sensible response is calm down. Let\u2019s remind ourselves why we now have VAR. It arrived after many years of flagrant refereeing errors being repeatedly exposed in slow-motion on TV. Cast your mind back to the second leg of the World Cup qualifying play-off between France and Ireland at the Stade de France in 2009. In extra time Thierry Henry controls a long free-kick with his hand, guiding the ball twice with his palm, before crossing to William Gallas to score the goal that knocked a furious Republic of Ireland out of the 2010 World Cup. It was against the spirit of the game, the watching world agreed \u2013 all, that is, except the French fans inside the stadium, who celebrated like mad. The Irish players ran after the referee vainly trying to get him to overrule his myopic decision. They didn\u2019t think: \u2018Oh, but what will that do to the atmosphere?\u2019 They weren\u2019t worried about the possibility of interrupting the jubilation of the home fans. But let\u2019s recall what happened when an over\u2011sensitivity to home fans\u2019 emotions affected referees\u2019 performances. Every travelling supporter can wax hysterical about shocking examples of \u201chomer\u201d officials, who have been a little too attuned to the majority sentiments of a crowd. Perhaps away fans are simply grievance-ridden (in spite of statistical evidence strongly suggesting referees favour home teams), and are more likely to feel embattled and neglected. So let\u2019s take a more neutral example: the 2002 World Cup, which was held jointly in South Korea and Japan. Remember the World Cup is the pinnacle of football, the spectacle watched by billions that showcases the very best, the elite level to which all players and officials aspire, and an example to the rest of football. In that World Cup South Korea, supported by their passionate fans, played Spain in the quarter-final. South Korea lost 3-0. Except, in reality, South Korea won on penalties, because all three Spanish goals, demonstrably legitimate, were ruled out, the first by Gamal Ghandour, the Egyptian referee, for obscure reasons, the second wrongly adjudged offside and the third ruled out because the ball \u2013 clearly still in \u2013 was said to have crossed the dead-ball line before Fernando Morientes headed it in. Many other decisions went against Spain in that match, which was roundly denounced as a scandal. However, it was almost a model of fair play by comparison with the previous Korea match, against Italy in the second round. Within three minutes of the start, the Ecuadorian referee Byron Moreno awarded a penalty to Korea, when Seol Ki-hyeon fell mysteriously in the Italian penalty area. Fortunately Gianluigi Buffon saved the resulting kick. Moreno went on to make a serious of extraordinary decisions, almost all of them in Korea\u2019s favour. Paolo Maldini was kicked in the head and Alessandro Del Piero was elbowed in the face, without any punishment to the Koreans inflicting the damage. Then Francesco Totti, on a yellow card, was sent off after being booked for diving, though he was clearly tripped. And in extra time Damiano Tommasi had an obviously legitimate goal bizarrely ruled out for offside. In both matches the Korean fans were ecstatic after the perverse rulings. Can you just imagine how unspeakably unkind it would have been to curtail their celebrations by overturning these egregious refereeing errors? Forget the disappointment of the Italy and Spain players, who had been working their whole careers to reach this stage, and think of the unbearable deflation of those joyful fans. Because apparently preventing that feeling is the spirit of football. Incidentally, though South Korea enjoyed an abundance of refereeing favours, no one would suggest there was any skulduggery or corruption involved. These things happen, after all. And only cynics would look at the fact that Moreno was later imprisoned for heroin trafficking as any kind of reflection on his moral standing or professional reliability. Yes, VAR could be speeded up \u2013 and doubtless will be as practitioners adjust to its demands \u2013 and, yes, there is an argument that the new handball law is too stringent and requires a little thoughtful reform. But it\u2019s madness to confuse these separate issues with the emotional requirements of a celebrating crowd. The overwhelming majority of goals scored this season have been subject to no noticeable review and their accompanying celebrations have not been remotely hindered. And while it was a tad unfortunate for the City fans that their ecstasy was rudely stopped, just as had happened in the last minute of last season\u2019s Champions League quarter-final against the same opposition, think for a moment of the unconfined joy and relief experienced by the travelling Spurs fans. Are they any less deserving of their emotions? Vertiginous highs and crushing lows. Or as the old spiritual goes: Someone\u2019s laughing, Lord, kumbaya. Someone\u2019s crying, Lord, kumbaya. That\u2019s the spirit of football, and long may it last.",

      "bodyText": "More from Klopp, who goes on to praise the incredible work rate of his players. \u201cOur identity is intensity and that\u2019s how we showed up today. I qwould have loved to have had a clean sheet today, but Arsenal is a quality side. They didn\u2019t have that many chances. We were really in charge and won the game comfortably.\u201d Jurgen Klopp speaks: \u201cI saw a brilliant game from my side so early in the season,\u201d he says to Sky. \u201cIt was outstanding. It was a performance full of power, full of energy, full of greed, full of passion. We were a bit surprised by the system they played, but we adapted well to the diamond with switching the sides and constant crosses.\u201d Paul Wilson was on hand to see another Liverpool masterclass as Arsenal were put to the sword for the fourth time in consecutive visits to Anfield. Joel Matip speaks: \u201cIt was a tough game against a deep standing and a high quality team,\u201d says the scorer of Liverpool\u2019s first goal in an interview with Sky Sports. \u201cIf a team with these kind of players with such quality is standing on [the edge of] their box with eight players, it\u2019s hard to break through.\u201d On the subject of Arsenal\u2019s pacy attackers, he says it was really hard to defend against them on the counter-attack, because they\u2019re such good players. Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeep! It\u2019s all over at Anfield, where Liverpool have maintained their 100% record for this season with a win over Arsenal that could scarcely have been more emphatic until they took their foot off the gas. Joel Matip opened the scoring, before Mo Salah added two more. Lucas Torreira scored a late consolation for Arsenal, who were overwhelmed by a vastly superior team for long periods of this game. 90+3 min: Free-kick for Arsenal, about 30 yards from the Liverpool goal, almost dead centre. David Luiz tries his luck, but it\u2019s not his day. He sends the ball high over the bar, into a jeering Kop. 90+1 min: Presumably they\u2019re all exhausted, but I haven\u2019t been hugely impressed by the manner in which Liverpool\u2019s players have finished this game. There\u2019s been a noticeably large and predictable drop in intensity, but they\u2019ve let Arsenal get themselves back in the game by scoring one goal and then creating a scoring chance that went unconverted by Lacazette moments ago. 87 min: Crikey! Ainsley Maitland-Niles floats a cross to the far post, where Lacazette chests it down unmarked. With a better first touch, he\u2019d have had a clear shooting opportunity with plenty of goal to aim at. With the ball at the byline, he pulls it behind him and then appeals for a penalty for - I think - a possible handball by Trent Alexander-Arnold. The chaps at VAR HQ aren\u2019t inclined to throw him a bone. That could have made for a very interesting final few minutes. 86 min: Arsenal substitution: Matteo Guendouzi off, Henrikh Mkhitaryan on. From a corner, the ball is worked to Lucas Torreira in the Liverpool penalty area. He gets the ball stuck under his feet under pressure from Jordan Henderson, eventually digs it out and stabs a shot from 10 yards into the bottom right-hand corner. 82 min: Salah cuts in from the right again, before playing the ball to Roberto Firmino with his back to goal in the Arsenal penalty area. As he tries to turn, Xhaka dispossesses him and the Brazilian goes to ground. His appeals for a penalty fall on deaf ears and Anthony Taylor waves play on. 80 min: Arsenal attempt to salvage some pride, with Monreal lofting a ball towards Aubamayang in the penalty area. Liverpool clear. Arsenal substitution: Alexandre Lacazette on for Joe Willock. He takes a central position up front, with Nicolas Pepe to his right and Aubamayang to his left. 77 min: Liverpool substitution: a beaming Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain on, Sadio Mane off. And why wouldn\u2019t the Ox be smiling? His team is 3-0 up and he signed a new extended deal during the week. 75 min: Nicolas Pepe sends a left-footed cross to Aubamayang, who was ghosting in towards the far post. Milner heads the ball out for a corner. Nothing comes of it. 74 min: On their past four visits to Anfield, Arsenal have lost 5-1, 4-0 and 3-1. They\u2019ve been dreadful on at least two of those occasions, but are actually playing reasonably well today. Liverpool are just much, much better than them. I\u2019ll be surprised if there aren\u2019t a couple of more Liverpool goals here, as Arsenal\u2019s players look absolutely shattered and dead on their feet. 71 min: Jordan Henderson picks out Firmino with an excellent pass down the inside left. He curls a cross towards the far post, where Salah is waiting, but Arsenal clear their lines. 70 min: Salah sprints into the Liverpool penalty area from the right with the ball at his feet again. Instead of shooting, he attempts to square the ball for Mane at the far post and his pass is cut out by Sokratis. 70 min: Having come out for the second half, snarling and snapping like the hounds of hell as they went about Arsenal, Liverpool have calmed things down a notch. 69 min: Firmino tries to pick out Mane with a cross into the Arsenal box. It\u2019s intercepted and headed clear. Liverpool substitution: James Milner on for Gini Wijnaldum. 67 min: Maitland-Niles and Pepe combine down the right, with the latter trying to pick out a Aubamayang with a cross. Adrian smothers the ball in a warm embrace. 65 min: Through on goal with Matteo Guendouzi all over him like a cheap suit, Mo Salah is flagged for offside. If he\u2019d stayed on he\u2019d have either scored or won another penalty. 64 min: Arsenal win a corner, then another after a Monreal header is put out by Alexander-Arnold. Nothing comes of it. 63 min: Arsenal substitution: Dani Cabellos, who has barely had a touch of the ball, makes way for Lucas Torreira. 62 min: Roberto Firmino tries a shot from the edge of the Arsenal penalty area, as Liverpool continue to overwhelm their opponents. Bernd Leno saves. 61 min: Signed to shore up the Arsenal defence, David Luiz is not having one of his better days. Having given away the penalty that led to Liverpool\u2019s second, he allowed Salah to take possession and turn him out on the touchline for the third. Salah scores his second. He picks up the ball on the right flank, beating Luiz and Monreal in the process. Cutting inside, he bears down on goal and with options to his left he slots the ball into the bottom left-hand corner. It\u2019s a very composed finish. 58 min: \u201cYou can see he\u2019s a talent but this game is just passing him by,\u201d adds Neville, talking about Dani Cebellos, who is doing nothing. 56 min: Firmino tries a shot from the edge of the penalty area, but it\u2019s blocked. Moments later, Andy Robertson sends a cross to the far post from the left flank. Mo Salah beats his man, but heads over the bar. Arsenal are getting spanked here. \u201cThis Liverpool team is just destroying them,\u201d declares Gary Neville, who is on co-comms alongside Martin Tyler on Sky Sports. 54 min: Sokratis goes to ground winded after throwing himself in front of a Trent Alexander-Arnold pile-driver. Referee Anthony Taylor graciously gives him a few seconds to catch his breath. 52 min: Bernd Leno is forced to rush out of his penalty area and hack the bvall clear after Nicolas Pepe was dispossessed in midfield and Liverpool galloped upfield on the counter in a four v two. Arsenal could get absolutely mauled here. 50 min: I\u2019m a huge fan of David Luiz, but his reaction to being penalised for what was an obvious yank on Salah\u2019s shirt was comical. He was caught, quite literally, red-handed with a fist full of his man\u2019s scarlet shirt but still feigned innocence and was outraged at having a penalty awarded against him. Mo Salah doubles Liverpool\u2019s lead, sending Bernd Leno the wrong way as he rifles the ball into the top left-hand corner. You won\u2019t see a better penalty kick than that. David Luiz is penalised and booked for pulling on the shirt of Mo Salah in the Arsenal penalty area as the Egyptian tried to get on the end of a wonderful Roberto Firmino pass. 46 min: Liverpool immediately go on the attack and Bernd Leno is forced into a smart save. 46 min: Arsenal get the ball rolling for the second half, playing into the Kop end. There are no changes in personnel on either side. An email: \u201cGenuine query from a suffering fan,\u201d wrote Abhijato Sensarma, before Arsenal went behind. \u201cDo you think Arsenal have a genuine chance of winning the EPL?\u201d No, none whatsoever. Next! Peep! Liverpool go in at the break with a one-goal lead, the all important strike a Joel Matip header from a Trent Alexander-Arnold corner on 41 minutes. Arsenal have been dominated, but not without chances - the pick of them coming when Nicolas Pepe found himself in a one-on-one with Adrian, only to come up short with a feeble shot straight at the goalkeeper. 45+2 min: Salah plays the ball to Mane in the Arsenal penalty area, continues his run and picks up the return pass. Under pressure from Guendouzi, he sends the ball wide from a tight angle. 45 min: Replays of the goal show that as Trent Alexander-Arnold\u2019s delivery was fizzing into the penalty area, Arsenal\u2019s defenders were so worried about containing Virgil van Dijk, that they actually got in each other\u2019s way. Grabbing the front of Dutchman\u2019s shirt and refusing to let go, Sokratiss outstretched arm actually prevented Guendouzi from marking Matip, who jumped for a free header. 42 min: Well, you can\u2019t say that wasn\u2019t coming. Liverpool\u2019s full-backs have been given licence to roam and even though it was from a se-piece, it was one of their crosses that helped the home side opened the scoring. Matteo Guendozi was caught napping as Joel Matip leapt to get on the end of Alexander-Arnold\u2019s delivery and send a bullet header past Bernd Leno. Liverpool lead. Trent Alexander-Corner sends the ball into the mixer from a corner and Joel Matip heads home. 39 min: From a throw-in, Mo Salah rolls Granit Xhaka in the Liverpool penalty area before sending a low diagonal drive flashing inches wide of the far post. 38 min: Andy Robertson drops a good delivery towards Firmino at the far post, but David Luiz intervenes to avert the danger. 37 min: Liverpool free-kick about 35 yards from the Arsenal goal in a central position after a foul on Sadi Mane. 34 min: Play resumes, with nobody getting sent off and the crowd none the wiser as to what particular incident was being checked. Trent Alexander-Arnold\u2019s corner is headed clear. Within seconds, Nicolas Pepe has robbed the ball from Jordan Henderson and is bearing down on the Liverpool penalty area. He gets the better of Andy Robertson, the only defender between him and Adrian, before striking a weak shot straight at the goalkeeper. That was the chance of the game so far. 33 min: Play is interrupted for a VAR intervention. I have no idea what is being checked, much like the players and the crowd. It\u2019s a potential red card, apparently. 32 min: Robertson crosses from the left, trying to pick out Mo Salah. He\u2019s crowded off the ball, which breaks to Alexander-Arnold on the right. He pulls it back to Jordan Henderson, whose first time shot takes a deflection on its way over the bar. 31 min: Pepe tries a shot from just outside the Liverpool penalty area, as Andy Robertson stands off him. He tries to curl the ball into the top corner, but it sails agonisingly wide. Good effort! 30 min: Bernd Leno leaps to pluck another Trent Alexander-Arnold cross from out on the right flank from the sky. 27 min: Arsenal enjoy some time on the ball, giving their already knackered midfielders a chance for a breather. They\u2019re being run ragged by a dragging them from one side of the pitch to the other repeatedly, with the manner in which they\u2019re constantly switching play. 25 min: Granit Xhaka hoofs the ball long for Pepe to chase after another bout of sustained Liverpool pressure. He\u2019s unable to get to it and Liverpool resume possession. Moments previously, Sadio Mane tried a shot from distance, only to see his effort sail into the stand behind the goal. 22 min: Liverpool have three shots on the Arsenal goal in quick succession. None trouble Bernd Leno. On Sky, Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher are discussing the freedom of the park Arsenal are giving to Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson, saying \u201cit\u2019s what Arsenal want\u201d, so their front two can get tight on Joel Matip and Virgil van Dijk. It seems a decidedly risky strategy to me, because it looks to be only a matter of time before Liverpool score. 20 min: A woeful Dani Cabellos pass across his own penalty area from the corner flag drops to the feet of Sadio Mane. He shoots low and hard, Bernd Leno saves and Cabellos waves a hand in apology to his team-mates. 17 min: Henderson switches play out to the left wing again during a sustained period of possession for Liverpool. Arsenal attack swiftly on the counter- however and Pepe tries his luck with a shot. Adrian saves his low drive. 15 min: Having weathered an early storm, Arsenal have shown signs of improvement. They\u2019re playing l;ong balls up the left and right channels for Pepe and Aubamayang to chase and the pair are finding plenty of space to work in, what with Liverpool\u2019s full-backs getting left high up the pitch. 11 min: Adrian gallops out of his penalty area to clear a through ball from Aubamayang to Pepe, who is being shepherded by Virgil van Dijk. He hacks the ball as far as Aubamayang, who tries to loft the ball into the recently vacated Liverpool goal. He doesn\u2019t have the necessary accuracy and Liverpool\u2019s goalkeeper gets away with his needless rush of blood to the head. 10 min: Andy Robertson receives a pass from Henderson in acres of space out on the left flank. His cross into the penalty area is headed clear. 8 min: Liverpool\u2019s full-backs are getting the freedom of the Anfield flanks. Trent Alexander-Arnold gets a cross in, but his delivery is put out for a corner by David Luiz. From the ensuing corner, taken by young Trent, Gini Wijnaldum gets a shot off but it\u2019s high over the bar. 7 min: Nicolas Pepe canters down the right flank on a counter-attack, but is dispossessed as he looks up to survey his options. As far as I can tell, Dani Ceballos has been tasked as playing as a No 10 behind a front two of Aubamayang and Pepe. 5 min: Arsenal are seriously under the cosh in these early stages, struggling to get the ball out of their own half under the intensity of Liverpool\u2019s pressing. With Arsenal trying to keep the midfield area so narrow, Liverpool are switching play from wing to wing, where they\u2019ve more space to operate. 3 min: Liverpool win a free-kick, wide on left. The ball\u2019s floated into the penalty area and looks to be falling for Virgil van Dijk. David Luiz gets a touch on it to avert the danger. 2 min: Arsenal line up with a narrow midfield diamond and are immediately on the back foot. Liverpool switch play from right to left, where Andy Robertson gets on the ball. His low ball through the Arsenal penalty area only just evades the lunge of Roberto Firmino at the back post. Close! 1 min: Liverpool kick off, playing into the Kop end in the first half at the request of Arsenal, who won the toss. Their players wear red shirts, shorts and socks. Arsenal are in navy, with luminous yellow trim. Not long now: Jordan Henderson and Granit Xhaka lead the teams out on to the Anfield sward on a sunny summer\u2019s evening on Merseyside. Both sets of players line up for the last of the pre-match niceties and kick-off is just a few minutes away. Away days: We\u2019ve had five away wins out of five fixtures played in the Premier League today, with Chelsea, Crystal Palace, Southampton, Leicester and West Ham all triumphing on the road. Can Arsenal make it six out of six? Recent history suggests not, but we\u2019ll find out soon enough if they can end Liverpool\u2019s 41-match unbeaten streak at home. Meanwhile over on Twitter: Arseblog \u2013 a man who knows far more about the Gunners than I do \u2013 reckons that Unai Emery may play a midfield diamond. How will Arsenal line up? Only time will tell, as it\u2019s a slightly perplexing selection by Unai Emery, who has picked three central midfielders (four if you include Dani Ceballos). My guess, which will almnost certainly be wrong, is that Granit Xhaka will play in the centre of midfield, with Joe Willock on the right and Matteo Guendouzi on the left. Up front, Dani Ceballos will play on the left of a front three, with Pierre Emerick-Aubamayang in the middle and Nicolas Pepe on the right. We\u2019ll find out how completely wrong I am in just under 30 minutes. Fabinho and Jordan Henderson come back into Liverpool\u2019s midfield, with James Milner and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain making way. Nicolas Pepe and Granit Xhaka start for Arsenal, with Alexandre Lacazette and Reiss Nelson dropping to the bench, Liverpool: Adrian, Alexander-Arnold, van Dijk, Matip, Robertson, Henderson, Fabinho, Wijnaldum, Salah, Firmino, Mane. Subs: Milner, Gomez, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Lallana, Shaqiri, Origi, Kelleher. Arsenal: Leno, Maitland-Niles, Luiz, Papastathopoulos, Monreal, Guendouzi, Xhaka, Willock, Pepe, Aubameyang, Ceballos. Subs: Mkhitaryan, Lacazette, Torreira, Chambers, Nelson, Martinez, Kolasinac. Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire) Early team news: Nicolas Pepe, Mesut Ozil and Granit Xhaka are all in contention to start for Arsenal, but Unai Emery said yesterday that he would not decide on his line-up until this morning. If, as expected, Xhaka and Pepe start, Joe Willock and Reiss Nelson will probably make way. Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson remains sidelined with a calf injury, so Adrian will continue between the sticks. Dejan Lovren and Naby Keita are both injured, but would almost certainly not have started anyway. Arsenal travel to Anfield without a win against Liverpool to their name in the past eight meetings of the sides. In the corresponding fixture last season, Unai Emery\u2019s side were the victims of a 5-1 shellacking, their third consecutive defeat at Anfield. If they can prevail today, it will be their first win at Liverpool\u2019s ground in seven years. Kick-off is at 5.30pm (BST), but stay tuned in the meantime for team news and build-up.",

That\u2019s the only run from the over. Stokeswatch: 2 from 46 balls. </p> <p>There was a nice incident off the last ball of the over. Stokes left a short ball from Cummins which didn\u2019t miss the bat by much. Australia appealed, and Paine in particular seemed keen to review. As the DRS clock ticked down, he started talking to Stokes, trying to gauge whether he looked guilty or not. (Some players do \u2013 Joe Root has an awful poker face.) Stokes ignored him, and Australia decided not to review. It was all very playful and good-natured. I wonder if we\u2019ll ever get to the stage where batsmen try to look guilty so that the opposition wastes a review. I digress. It\u2019s been a long day.

They tried him briefly at Burns yesterday, but he got out too quickly - hooking Cummins - which denied the spinner a proper spell. The left-hander pushes the first, a full toss, for a couple to midwicket. There are two men around the bat on the off side and Burns splits the two of them on the front foot - solid batting. He then cuts one to deep point, leaving Roy one to keep out with less than a minute to 1pm. He takes guard, killing enough time to make this the final ball of the session. He gets on the front foot, driving one to long-on to finish. <strong>The crowd give it big</strong> as they leave the field, thrilled that England have made it to the end of the fourth over without losing a wicket.<strong> </strong>Very good. <br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-24T12:43:11.058Z\">at 1.43pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d61254f8f081cf11cf1c43c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-24T11:57:38.859Z\">12.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>3rd over: England 7-0 (Burns 2, Roy 5) </strong>Hard hands!

If we somehow manage to limit the Aussie lead to 320 - and leave ourselves the best part of five sessions to attempt to chase it down, breaking all sorts of records in the process (as if!) - we must approach it with one simple mantra; Do Not Get Out. Think Edgbaston 05 from the Aussie perspective. There are overs aplenty to work with, our batsmen should try and get close enough to make them nervous as hell before we then see if we can pull off one of the biggest steals in test history. Leave the wide balls alone. Decide to score only in risk free areas. Get them in singles. Of course, we\u2019ll subside for a flashy 150 instead, most of them from a marooned Buttler, won\u2019t we?\u201d </p> <p>But the problem is batting in that manner is not familiar to these players. I wish I could remember the exact piece but someone wrote a story recently quoting AB de Villiers discussing batting for time and it was zen-like it is clarity that for ABdV the mindset is identical for a T20 as for dead-batting to save a Test. That\u2019s what made him so freakish.

When he was appointed the smart money would have been on Australia falling apart after What Had Happened. Instead here we are. Lots of teams have talked about rotating bowlers but none have managed to make it happen, and yet the Australian bowlers have accepted it and played their roles. It speaks of a very harmonious dressing room, where it could have been carnage. Good, quiet, positive captaincy.\u201d</p> <p>Moreover, this is a likeable Australian team. They\u2019re winning an Ashes on English soil without rubbing anybody up the wrong way, spoiling for fights or headbutting the line. It\u2019s been refreshing to watch a keenly fought series play out in such a positive spirit. Paine deserves praise for that also.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d6105218f081cf11cf1c349\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-24T09:38:09.356Z\">10.38am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Gareth Frith is ready for a changing of the guard. \u201cWell, this does seem to have an end of an era feel about it. Bayliss is on the verge of going, and with him possibly the \u201cplay our own exciting brand of cricket\u201d mindset that Test fans have had to endure over the past couple of years. Collapse after collapse suggests something is wrong in the approach, not necessarily just the talent. As with other forms of gambling, when the fun stops, stop. And it stopped about four years ago.</p> <p>Having said that, you have to pick the right players, and along with Denly and Roy I\u2019d put a big question mark on Bairstow\u2019s head, and that of Buttler. <br><br>England have lucked out in having Archer come in, they have to look at the next Ashes series in Australia with him, Stone and Wood possibly fronting up a very exciting attack which they\u2019ve not had in a long time, and use these next Test series to strengthen them as a unit. Leach looks to have the right temperament as a spinner who could hold an end down and do a useful if unspectacular job, which is what is required, a job Anderson can also do home and abroad if he\u2019s still around. <br><br>The batting needs serious work if this bowling talent is not to be squandered, and some of the senior members need to realise they\u2019re not undroppable.

After two and a half Tests Australia have earned themselves a 1-0 series advantage and such an ascendancy at Leeds it seems only a matter of when, and not if, they secure the victory required to take an unassailable lead.</p> <p>When the 2019 Ashes is distilled by documentarians and diarists, yesterday\u2019s commotion will feature prominently in the narrative arcs. Australia, skittled for under 200 on day one and missing their star player, obliterated England with sustained controlled aggression that had their hosts grasping at air. If one man was the difference at Edgbaston, something more profound flowered at Headingley.</p> <p>England now have plenty of soul searching to do. How can they arrest such an abysmal run of batting form at Test level? How do they handle Joe Root? After spending so much effort (rightly, in my opinion) on the World Cup cycle, what does the next strategic plan look like and when does it come into effect? How bare is the cupboard?</p> <p>By contrast, Australia have plenty of back-slapping to do. Their plan has come together superbly. In particular the rotation of the bowling attack to ensure hunger and fitness, and the acclimatisation of all squad members to English conditions. The visitors have established an edge over their World Cup weary hosts unfamiliar to Ashes contests for most of the past couple of decades.</p> <p>Or have I gone too soon? Could England pull off an \u201881 style miracle again? Are we in for a landmark \u201cI was there\u201d day of Test cricket? Probably not, but it\u2019s an excuse to needle drop the sound of mumsy acid wash denim.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>A sneak peek at Ed Smith\u2019s post-Test review with Jason Roy.</figcaption> </figure>  </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-24T08:54:26.510Z\">at 9.54am BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "England need another 203 runs to complete a Headingley miracle to go alongside 1981 and 2001. Australia need seven wickets to retgain the Ashes, and they are still huge favourites. The new ball is due after eight overs tomorrow, and their impeccable bowling in the last hour and a half - England were 22 for one from the last 21 overs - means they still have plenty of runs to play with. 72nd over: England 156-3 (Root 76, Stokes 2) The last over of the day. Root takes a single, which allows Lyon one last crack at Stokes. \u201cCome on Gaz, take him with us Gaz!\u201d drawls one of the players around the bat, apparently unaware that the batsmen leave the field at the close of play regardless. Stokes defends very solidly and ends the day on 2 from 50 balls. Joe Root is 75 not out from 189 balls. In the context of the match, his form and his captaincy career, that\u2019s an innings of rare mental strength. I think his 144 at Cardiff in 2015 will always be his greatest innings, but this might be his most admirable. 71st over: England 155-3 (Root 74, Stokes 2) Once more unto the Kirkstall Lane End for Pat Cummins, who could all but secure the Ashes by taking a late wicket here. He bowls a series of short balls to Stokes, one of which is given as a wide by Joel Wilson. We\u2019ll hear more about that when England win by one wicket at 4.21pm tomorrow. That\u2019s the only run from the over. Stokeswatch: 2 from 46 balls. There was a nice incident off the last ball of the over. Stokes left a short ball from Cummins which didn\u2019t miss the bat by much. Australia appealed, and Paine in particular seemed keen to review. As the DRS clock ticked down, he started talking to Stokes, trying to gauge whether he looked guilty or not. (Some players do \u2013 Joe Root has an awful poker face.) Stokes ignored him, and Australia decided not to review. It was all very playful and good-natured. I wonder if we\u2019ll ever get to the stage where batsmen try to look guilty so that the opposition wastes a review. I digress. It\u2019s been a long day. I thought I\u2019d be finished by 3pm. \u201cOh, the number of times I\u2019ve been called Imogen,\u201d laments Emma John. 70th over: England 154-3 (Root 74, Stokes 2) Labuschagne returns in place of Pattinson. Stokes gets an actual run, which takes him to 2 from 40 balls, strike-rate 5.00. I can\u2019t be the only one who is ... stimulated by such statistics. There has been only one boundary in the last 19 overs, though England won\u2019t mind that if they survive the last 10 minutes. \u201cAs a Clarke, I\u2019m in the habit of saying \u2018Clarke, with an E\u2019 when making telephone bookings,\u201d says Damian Clarke. \u201cMany years ago I arrived at a hotel to find they had no record of my reservation. As the hotel was full, I was left with a problem, but fortunately managed to find an alternative hotel down the road. The investigation into my later complaint to the original hotel discovered that they had a non-show on the day in question, a certain Mr. Clark Withany. I\u2019m a bit more careful these days.\u201d 69th over: England 151-3 (Root 73, Stokes 1) Lyon breaks the pattern by bowling a maiden to Root. It was another superb over, including a huge LBW appeal \u2013 from Lyon, anyway. It turned too much and would surely have missed leg stump. \u201cHaving seen you in action on a night out,\u201d says Alex Netherton, \u201cit\u2019s hard to believe a few bouncers haven\u2019t aimed at your head in the past. HONK.\u201d Challenging them to see who can do the 9x table the quickest never did go down well. 68th over: England 151-3 (Root 73, Stokes 1) The game has been locked in a pattern for the last half an hour. Root gets a single early in the over, Stokes defends the remainder. He has 1 from 35 balls. England are 17 for one from the last 17 overs, which shows how masterfully Australia have bowled. They are just brilliant. 67th over: England 150-3 (Root 72, Stokes 1) Root drives England for a single to bring up the 150. This has been one of his best innings; certainly one of the mentally toughest, because he looked broken yesterday. \u201cTen years and a day ago I was thrilled to get a mention for my work colleague Sebastian who was marrying Jules the next day,\u201d says John Wyver. \u201cSeb maintains - I think more than half-seriously - that an OBO nod was their best wedding present. Not sure Jules agrees. But since there\u2019s not much going on at Headingley any chance of a tenth anniversary word?\u201d Well, why not. Happy anniversary! 66th over: England 149-3 (Root 71, Stokes 1) A sharp back-of-a-length delivery from Pattinson beats Root on the inside. He moves one the other way to find a thick edge from Root that scoots down to the shortish third man for a single, and Stokes defends the rest of the over: 1 from 28 balls now, a strike-rate of 3.57. It\u2019s all strangely compelling. \u201cI think I can trump the submissions so far for misspellings of names,\u201d says Peter Wood. \u201cMany years ago I was working for an employment scheme for people with physical and learning difficulties. Part of the remit was contacting companies to see if they would take on someone. I rang a company, said I was Pete Wood from the Sheltered Placement Scheme and was put through to a bemused manager as Mr Pigwood from the Shoulder Replacement Scheme.\u201d 65th over: England 148-3 (Root 70, Stokes 1) Lyon attacks, Stokes defends. He has 1 from 25 balls. There has been some high-class cricket today, and a lot of fight from England, but Australia are still huge favourites to win this match. \u201cSo long as Marnus Labuschagne doesn\u2019t start saying \u2018What\u2019s my name?\u2019 after every boundary, in the manner of Muhammad Ali,\u201d says Matt Kirkham. 64th over: England 147-3 (Root 69, Stokes 1) Pattinson replaces Hazlewood, who bowled an unreal old-ball spell of 7-4-3-1. Stokes continues to focus exclusively on defence. That makes sense given the situation, with only half an hour remaining, and there\u2019s probably a bit of penance for his first-innings dismissal as well. 63rd over: England 146-3 (Root 68, Stokes 1) Lyon loves bowling to left-handers at the best of times, never mind on a bit of a dustbowl, so there is a spring in his step as he attacks Stokes. It\u2019s a maiden, with Stokes looking solid in defence. Thanks to all for this, the TMS link. 62nd over: England 146-3 (Root 68, Stokes 1) \u201cDenly out because he used his hand to block a ball headed for his head,\u201d says William. \u201cIf the cricketing authorities are serious about concussions, surely such an action should be permitted without penalty? Amend the rules so that if a fast delivery is aimed for the batsman\u2019s head and it hits a glove, the ball is dead? Something. Anything. Right now the choice is between possible concussion or possible loss of wicket. Don\u2019t put the batsmen in that sort of position when it comes to potential brain injury.\u201d Is it really a conscious choice? I thought he shaped to hook and then couldn\u2019t drop the gloves because the bouncer was so well-directed. That said, I have never had an 85mph bouncer moving inexorably towards my noggin, so I\u2019m no expert. Does anyone have the overseas TMS link? We\u2019ve had a few requests but I can\u2019t find it. 61st over: England 145-3 (Root 68, Stokes 0) Root reverse-sweeps a boundary off Lyon, who looks entirely unimpressed. The rest of the over is excellent from Lyon, forcing a few uncomfortable defensive strokes from Root. \u201cMy surname isn\u2019t hard or unusual: Corrigan,\u201d says Dominic Corrigan. \u201cYears ago I moved house and called BT to register my new phone line. I told them my name, and was greeted with \u2018Oh, how unusual, could you spell that for me?\u2019 I spelled it out, letter by letter. They even repeated it back to me. A week later I received my letter from BT telling me my phone line was live. Addressed to \u2018Mr Cogipal\u2019. Labuschagne is easy.\u201d 60th over: England 141-3 (Root 64, Stokes 0) Denly scrapped 155 balls for his 50. It was such an impressive innings, certainly his best for England, but in the end Hazlewood was too good. Australia\u2019s bowling in the last 40 minutes, at a time when other teams would have surrendered to fatalism, has been awesome. The last nine overs have brought seven runs and the wicket of Denly. It was a beautifully directed short ball from Hazlewood. Denly shaped to hook, realised he was in trouble and tried to get out of the way. But it was too late and he gloved the ball high in the air to Tim Paine. A wicket was in the post - and the brilliant Josh Hazlewood has taken it! 59th over: England 140-2 (Root 64, Denly 50) An extremely eventful maiden concludes with a run-out referral against Denly. He went down the track and drove the ball back at Lyon, who picked it and threw down the stumps, Roger Harper-style. Denly was safely home. This is glorious stuff. Denly survives! It turned too much and was missing leg stump, so Australia lose a review. They have one remaining. The ball has really started to rag for Lyon. 58.4 overs: England 140-2 (Root 64, Denly 50) Denly survives a big LBW shout from Lyon. He has a long chat with Paine, who starts to signal for a review and then changes his mind. It\u2019s the right decision, as it was missing leg stump. \u201cYou can feel something is about to happen,\u201d says Ricky Ponting on Sky. And now there is a review for LBW against Denly! 58th over: England 140-2 (Root 64, Denly 50) Hazlewood, who struggled slightly in England four years ago, has been majestic this time round. He slips a fantastic delivery past the outside edge of Root and follows it with a few words. Root holds the pose and beams down the pitch at the bowler. The next ball is a carbon-copy, another snorter that is followed by a few impromptu observations regarding Root\u2019s technique. Root smiles again, and then leaves the last ball of the over with a flourish. This is brilliant cricket. A maiden from Hazlewood, which means England have scored six runs from the last seven overs. \u201cIs another scandal brewing?\u201d says Ian Copestake. \u201cThere may be more tearful press conferences to endure if the Aussie bowlers are indeed found to be DRS users.\u201d Responsible ones, too. And these men are fast bowlers! I\u2019ve never known such deviance. 57th over: England 140-2 (Root 64, Denly 50) \u201cIn amongst the rubble of this Ashes series, I have to say I\u2019ve quite enjoyed Alastair Cook\u2019s work on TMS this series,\u201d says Guy Hornsby. \u201cHe seems way more relaxed and pleasingly honest behind the mic than when he had it stuffed under his face chin or in the middle (the latter being less of a surprise, given many of his rearguards). It\u2019s been a tiny sliver of pleasure amongst the carnage, and he compares really well to some of the self-appointed comedians or \u2018personalities\u2019 that we\u2019re usually treated to. A second age of Cook we can all subscribe to.\u201d 56th over: England 138-2 (Root 63, Denly 50) Australia are building pressure through dot balls. Denly ignores a couple of tempters outside off stump before being hit on the pad outside the line. There have been four runs from the last five overs. If you are an England fan, and if you close your eyes and concentrate hard enough, you might be able to hear the first strains of the Jaws theme. \u201cMy first name is spelled \u2018Brenden\u2019,\u201d says Brenden Fawkes. \u201cI once had a boss claim this was an example of me being uppity for asking it to be changed from \u2018Brendan\u2019 on the roster. I feel you brother.\u201d The principle of people getting it wrong has never really bothered me. As with most things, the distressing part is the human contact. 55th over: England 138-2 (Root 62, Denly 50) Lyon is bowling the classical, aggressive Australian offspinner\u2019s line, well wide of off stump. Root is hit on the pad by consecutive deliveries, both outside the line - and then he has a very lucky escape. He charged Lyon, a slightly flustered decision, and got an inside-edge that deflected onto the pad and then onto Paine\u2019s shin. That could easily have been a stumping chance. A brilliant over from Lyon, the kind that scrambles a batsman\u2019s mind. 54th over: England 137-2 (Root 61, Denly 50) Denly survives a big shout for LBW from Hazlewood. Paine looks quite keen to review but Hazlewood dissuades him, suggesting it was too high. He\u2019s right. These brilliant Australian quicks are even responsible DRS users. \u201cG\u2019day from sunny Scotland, Rob,\u201d says Paul Jarvis. \u201cAs a schoolboy in Hobart I played against Tim Paine. From memory we got him out once, the other times he belted us around the Rokeby village green then left for training for the junior state squad.\u201d 53rd over: England 137-2 (Root 61, Denly 50) Lyon returns in place of Cummins, and Denly drives him down the ground for a single to reach a fine half-century. With the exception of a few loose drives, his approach and shot-selection have been exemplary. \u201cRob,\u201d says John Starbuck. \u201cWhere are George Davis\u2019s supporters when they\u2019re needed?\u201d 52nd over: England 135-2 (Root 60, Denly 49) \u201cGeoff Lemon gives a clinic on how to pronounce Labuschagne\u2019s name in the July 30th episode of the Guardian\u2019s - or rather the wonderful Emma John\u2019s - Spin podcast, from 27 mins onward,\u201d says Michael Jenkins. \u201cApparently Marnus got bored quickly of correcting Aussies and instead succumbed to the inevitable Aussie Shanification of his last name. Geoff insists on using the correct pronunciation out of respect and because, well, it\u2019s not that hard to get right.\u201d My surname has been mispronounced my whole life. You can\u2019t win. If you point out the error, you\u2019re an uppity pedant; if you don\u2019t, you\u2019re weak and guilty of truly despicable self-prejudice. It was a good ball from Hazlewood, which jagged back sharply off the seam - but there was a big inside-edge and Root survives! That was a poor decision from Chris Gaffaney, who shakes his head when he realises the error. Root is given out LBW - but he reviews straight away. 51st over: England 134-2 (Root 59, Denly 49) A loose short ball from Cummins, well wide of off stump, is blasted through the covers for four by Joe Denly. The next ball is a beauty, in at the ribs, but Denly does well to roll his wrists and flick it wide of leg gully for four more. Hazlewood fielded the ball inside the boundary but his foot was touching the rope as he did so. \u201cRob, I\u2019ve thought of a game saving strategy,\u201d says Kim Thonger. \u201cInstruct our batsmen to just keep heading every ball. The Doctor will have to keep coming out for concussion checks, that should waste hours. Also, if anyone manages to head it hard enough to actually get concussed, there\u2019s the added bonus of the time required to locate and pad up a like for like replacement. If we go hard with this approach I can\u2019t see the Aussies bowling much more than twenty overs by close of play on Monday?\u201d You jest, but I bet Jardine would have sanctioned that approach if it meant beating Australia. 50th over: England 125-2 (Root 59, Denly 41) Hazlewood replaces Pattinson and gets a soup\u00e7on of inswing to Root. He walks straight down the track to Denly, presumably to tell him either a) it\u2019s reversing or b) it isn\u2019t reversing and that was orthodox swing. It\u2019s a loosener-free return to the attack from Hazlewood, and Root defends the rest of the over. The WinViz predictor gives England a 30 per cent chance. I\u2019d make it nearer 5 per cent, for whatever it\u2019s worth. (Clue: nowt.) 49th over: England 124-2 (Root 59, Denly 41) Cummins is going to try some rough stuff. He has a long chat with Paine, after which fielders are placed at leg gully and short leg. Denly flicks a single wide of Head at leg gully; it was in the air but safe enough. \u201cTrust England,\u201d says Mark Lloyd, \u201cto start dangling the carrot of hope above the boiling soup of certain defeat...\u201d I\u2019m not feeling the hope. I think yesterday deadened sufficiently that the England Test team will be unable to inspire any hope in me until at least November 2037. 48th over: England 121-2 (Root 57, Denly 40) A maiden from Pattinson to Denly, with just a leg-bye off the final delivery. Batting has been much more comfortable in the last 20 overs or so. Australia have retained control, however, which means they will not panic even if England are still two down when the second new ball becomes available after 80 overs. 47th over: England 120-2 (Root 57, Denly 40) The best thing about this Root innings has been the lack of memorable shots. It\u2019s been nuggety and defiant, the kind of innings Allan Border used to play in the mid-1980s when Australia were rubbish. It might just be that he\u2019s had enough; either way, a switch has gone off in his head in the last 24 hours. \u201cA heroic but futile 302 all out is going to be the worst kind of result here for England,\u201d says Tanay Padhi. \u201cIt\u2019ll paper over the cracks and spin up all kinds of misplaced optimism.\u201d Yes, that\u2019s an excellent point. This has been admirable stuff, from Root in particular, but it doesn\u2019t change the need to rip this team up and start again. (NB: OBO hack reserves the right to airbrush this out of history if Root makes a matchwinning 177 not out, followed by 271 at Old Trafford and an Ashes-clinching 166 at the Oval.) 46th over: England 119-2 (Root 57, Denly 39) \u201cIf Roy was still to come in,\u201d says Ian Copestake, \u201chis and our collective mood would be almost chipper.\u201d 45th over: England 118-2 (Root 57, Denly 38) Pat Cummins, so good at taking a wicket when Australia need it most, returns to the attack. He is a rarity among bowlers - a flat-track bully - and England will surely just try to see him off rather than take any liberties. One from the over. \u201cDue to visitors I\u2019m missing our cricket match today, the last one before the Brazilian National Championships in two weeks,\u201d says Adam Hirst. \u201cCarioca Cricket Club might not be the best cricket team in the world, or even in Brazil (and there\u2019s only really four others\u2026) but we reckon we could be the most cosmopolitan. We\u2019ve got a flag count of 22 over the last few years, most of whom are still connected. Over the last few years we have had players from: India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Australia, New Zealand, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Wales, Palestine, Scotland, Brazil, Guyana, Singapore, Ireland, Syria, USA, Portugal, Canada, Bulgaria, France, Cyprus &amp; England = 22 countries. Can anyone out there better that?\u201d Insert your own 1993 Ashes joke here. 44th over: England 117-2 (Root 57, Denly 37) This is a good spell for England. The crowd are making plenty of noise and the Aussies are starting to get frustrated. They won\u2019t be worried yet but they are certainly irritated 44th over: England 117-2 (Root 57, Denly 37) Denly drives Pattinson sweetly through the covers for four to make it 12 runs from three balls, and a single off the next ball brings up a stirring hundred partnership. They get a standing ovation from the Headingley crowd, who have made quite a racket since tea. 43rd over: England 110-2 (Root 56, Denly 31) Root crunches Lyon through the covers for four to reach a superb half-century. He celebrates like Kevin the Teenager, head down as he points his bat to the crowd, but inside he will be hugely proud of the character he has shown. In context, this is one of the better innings of his Test career. He gets four more off the next ball, working a loose delivery to fine leg. \u201cErm, Martin Millband\u2019s time in the Netherlands has led him astray, because it was never a Dutch name,\u201d says Jonah Sack. \u201cIt\u2019s French originally, so \u2018Labu-shane\u2019 is defensible, and obviously what I\u2019d go for if I had to live among the Aussies. But here in Marnus Labuschagne\u2019s country of birth, Jon Blair is absolutely right - it\u2019s \u2018Labu-skugh-knee\u2019.\u201d I want to hear how Kate Bush would sing it. 42nd over: England 102-2 (Root 48, Denly 31) A storming delivery from Pattinson, full and seaming away, beats Root outside off stump. Australia have upped the intensity since the tea break; for all England\u2019s faults, they are playing against a magnificent bowling attack. 41st over: England 101-2 (Root 47, Denly 31) A grubber from Lyon to Denly beats everyone and goes for four byes. Denly then drives a single to bring up the England hundred, and reach his highest score of the series. Both he and Root have played commendably. Root survives a big, and slightly absurd, LBW appeal later in the over; it hit him well outside the line of off stump. 40th over: England 95-2 (Root 46, Denly 30) Pattinson, back in the attack, has a huge shout for LBW against Root turned down by Chris Gaffaney. I thought there was an inside edge, and it might have been outside the line as well. Tim Paine decides not to review. Replays show it was pad first - but the contact was well outside off stump. An excellent over from Pattinson, though. \u201cLooks like batting gets a bit easier once the ball is twenty overs old,\u201d says Felix Wood. \u201cEngland had no way of knowing this. No fault can be attached to anyone in the first innings. Talking of fault, every session you\u2019ve been doing OBO on England have prospered. These Aussie OBOers generally bring disaster. This feels like it might actually all be your fault.\u201d 39th over: England 95-2 (Root 46, Denly 30) Lyon returns to the attack after tea. Root drives his first ball through the covers for four, aided by a misfield from Harris. It\u2019s an excellent over from Lyon, though, and it looks like he has switched his line to well wide of off stump. \u201cI think that comment in the 37th over is slight hyperbole given some of the fast bowlers Australia have had,\u201d says Tony Harlow. \u201cTrue, Cummins wouldn\u2019t disgrace any attack they ever picked, but he might have a bit to go to get past McGrath, Lillee (who appropriately autocorrected to killer!) Thommo and others I never saw like Davison and Spofforth. Not quibbling - he\u2019s good - just reflecting they had some aces.\u201d Sorry, I meant at a particular point in time rather than an all-time XI. I do think he would get into any Australian team throughout history. Labuschagne department \u201cAs a Brit living in the Netherlands for 20 years I dispute Jon Blair\u2019s analysis of the pronunciation of Labuschagne,\u201d says Martin Millband. \u201cThe trick is to join the s to Labu and separate it from the ch. So Labus \u2013 ch (as in loch) \u2013 ag \u2013 (more or less the same as ch) \u2013 ne (I would say nuh rather than knee) \u201cCan\u2019t we just call him Kid Charlemagne,\u201d says Andrew Watson, \u201cand get on to more important topics, such as whether Jofra should be captain, PM, or both?\u201d \u201cThis is what the man himself says (about how to pronounce his name),\u201d says Josh Mandel, \u201calthough he\u2019s really sitting on the fence.\u201d That was a fine effort from Root and Denly. They had to work hard and ride their luck; in other words, they had to do some proper Test-match batting. The pitch has eased a bit, but don\u2019t get your hopes up - there is enough happening to suggest Australia will still win this game comfortably. Root and Denly have restored some pride, though. And they can vouch to their team-mates that, while Test match batting can be seriously hard work, it is also extremely rewarding. 38th over: England 90-2 (Root 41, Denly 30) Denly pads Labuschagne to short leg, where Wade takes a superb catch. But Australia are convinced it came off the glove and appeal unsuccessfully to Chris Gaffaney. Replays show it came off pad and then elbow. Denly survives, and that\u2019s tea. Lyon and Root have words as they walk off, but it all looks good-humoured and Root puts his arm around Lyon\u2019s shoulder. 37th over: England 89-2 (Root 40, Denly 30) Cummins gets one to burst from a length at Denly, who gloves it in the air and just in front of the man running towards leg gully. That was a brutish delivery from a sensational bowler who would get into any Australian attack in the history of the game. Denly does well to survive the rest of a furious over; it\u2019s another maiden. 36th over: England 89-2 (Root 40, Denly 30) Labuschagne switches around the wicket to Root. Nothing much to report in that over. \u201cI feel sad about Hameed,\u201d says Charles Miller. \u201cHe looked the real deal in India that time. Did he just never come back properly from that injury? Have Lancashire mismanaged him? What\u2019s occurring?\u201d No idea. There are suggestions he\u2019s lost his off stump, and there have been whispers about the influence of his father. I\u2019ve no idea whether that\u2019s fair or not. It\u2019s a good time for a change, I think, and I\u2019m sure there will be plenty of takers. He\u2019s the most impressive young England batsman I\u2019ve ever seen, so it\u2019s hard to believe it\u2019s come to this. And it is, as you say, very sad. But he\u2019s only 22, so there\u2019s no need to give up on him yet. 35th over: England 87-2 (Root 38, Denly 30) Tim Paine turns to Pat Cummins, who should have time for two overs before tea. It would be typical of him to rip out one of these batsmen in that time. He has a full over at Denly, who is happy to play for tea. A maiden. Meanwhile, we have our perp. \u201cRob, you know it and I know it,\u201d writes Gerard Aston. \u201cThis is on. Stokes to smite the winning runs!\u201d 34th over: England 87-2 (Root 38, Denly 30) Denly, whose series of false starts has brought to mind Mark Ramprakash\u2019s deceptively brilliant debut series in 1991, equals his highest score of the series by cutting Labuschagne for a single. 33rd over: England 82-2 (Root 35, Denly 28) \u201cI must admit, batting is starting to look a little easier out there,\u201d says Ricky Ponting on Sky. What a sensational commentator he is, by the way. Denly hooks Hazlewood confidently, albeit only for a single, and Root steals a couple of quick singles on the off side. This has been an admirably determined partnership from two players who, in different ways, are fighting for their future. 32nd over: England 78-2 (Root 33, Denly 27) Marnus Labuschagne comes on to bowl some part-time legspin. With the series he\u2019s had, it\u2019s not a bad move from Tim Paine. A decent first over goes for three runs. \u201cWhat\u2019s all this nonsense about the pronunciation of Labuschagne, and is he or someone else having a laugh by saying it is pronounced like Charlemagne?\u201d says Jon Blair. \u201cHe\u2019s from Klerksdorp for God\u2019s sake not Queensland. As any red blooded Afrikaner will tell you, it is pronounced like this below, and any attempt to Frenchify it is just plain laughable: Lab - Lubb as in \u201cland lubber\u201d u - as in \u201cooh missus\u201d sch - as in \u201cschool\u201d a - as in \u201cuh\u201d g - as in \u201cch\u201d when spoken by a Scot saying \u201cloch\u201d ne - as in \u201cknee\u201d.\u201d I noticed that Jonathan Trott pronounced it differently on Sky last night, and assumed he would know. 31st over: England 75-2 (Root 30, Denly 27) Root softens his hands to steer a boundary through the slips before smiling in response to the inevitable comment from the bowler Hazlewood. He\u2019s in danger of having some fun out there. Denly thick edges four more to third man later in the over, which amuses Hazlewood not one jot. \u201cDear Rob,\u201d says Boris Starling. \u201cThere\u2019s a great description of that afternoon (Holding vs Close) from none other than Lord Selvey of your parish, who of course had a ringside view. \u201c\u2018You have to understand the atmosphere during that game. It was a very hot summer and that day it was very oppressive. It wasn\u2019t a blazing hot day, but it was steamy. There was a really heavy, over-burdening atmosphere by the time Saturday came around, with storms threatening. All day there had been this incessant noise from the crowd, cans banging. This rhythm going all day, all day. It started to get to you and I am pretty sure it got to the West Indies bowlers as well. It was mesmeric and quite threatening. You could feel it winding down into you, this noise, and they got carried away with it.\u2019\u201d Selve was padded up as nightwatchman, which must have been quite a sight. 30th over: England 66-2 (Root 25, Denly 23) Lyon continues around the wicket to Root, who is playing almost everything off the back foot. He works another single round the corner to move England within 293 runs of immortality. Yeah. 29th over: England 65-2 (Root 24, Denly 23) Root is nowhere near his carefree best of a few years ago, and I can\u2019t remember a single attacking stroke in this innings, but he is playing with plenty of defiance. A pulled single off Hazlewood brings up a hard-fought fifty partnership with Denly, who is then beaten playing another loose drive. Darren Pattinson writes in: \u201cCan we have a comedy collapse with some hope thrown in for good measure to finish this off please? Haven\u2019t had one in a while. You know, 199-2 and then 210 all out (starting with a run out where both batsman end up at one end).\u201d That\u2019s not a comedy collapse. This is a comedy collapse. 28th over: England 64-2 (Root 23, Denly 23) \u201cThat Brian Close clip is a lovely YouTube memory,\u201d says Dave Seare. \u201cIt should be noted, though, that the Yorkshire hard man was wearing a protective plaster on his elbow.\u201d 27th over: England 63-2 (Root 22, Denly 23) Hazlewood replaces Pattinson and immediately beats Root with a beautiful delivery. Root is playing with admirable determination, because it would be much easier to nick off and hide in a darkened room for a few hours. When he gets off strike, Denly slams a swaggering pull stroke over midwicket for four. Shot! \u201cI want to ignite the debate again over who could become captain if Root continues his torrid series,\u201d says Robbie Chedburn. \u201cWhy not get Buttler in? He\u2019s reasonably young and is a kind of solid part of the team? On his day he\u2019s a solid batsman. Or we get someone new and fresh to do it, like Burns? The captaincy will add to his responsibility and might bolster his performance?\u201d The problem is that Buttler can\u2019t buy a run, and probably needs a break for the rest of the series himself. Also, England will need him as their white-ball captain pretty soon. If Root resigns after this game \u2013 not that he will \u2013 I would give it to Stuart Broad for the rest of the series while the selectors consider what the hell happens next. It\u2019s a rare old mess. 26th over: England 58-2 (Root 21, Denly 19) Lyon is teasing Root, following almost every delivery with a look which says: I know exactly how and when I am going to put you out of your misery. Root works a single behind square off the last ball of a tricky over;. \u201cI simply cannot imagine how appalled Brian Close would have been by all this helmet and concussion testing and like-for-like replacement stuff,\u201d says Brian Close. \u201cIf one had sent in a like-for-like replacement for him it would have been a punchbag made of reinforced concrete.\u201d The sight of Brian Close, aged 45, chesting down a 95mph bouncer like a centre-back will never cease to make me smile. 25th over: England 57-2 (Root 20, Denly 19) Denly survives a biggish LBW shout from Pattinson - too high - before being beaten yet again while chasing a wide one. I have no idea why he keeps playing (and missing) that shot. \u201cLet us know when you get the first \u2018can England do this?\u2019 email,\u201d says Ian Copestake. \u201cThe perp needs a good public shaming.\u201d The perp. 24th over: England 55-2 (Root 19, Denly 19) Lyon goes around the wicket and angles a good delivery past Root\u2019s outside edge. \u201cWell done for fronting up and going in for a difficult OBO afternoon,\u201d says Dave Seare. \u201cThis shellacking is painful because England are beating themselves. Previously the Australians have had the decency to do it for us.\u201d I think that\u2019s a bit unfair on the Australian bowlers, who have been extremely good all series. Mind you, it\u2019s very hard to make sense of this England team, so I\u2019ll probably have a completely different view by 5pm. 23rd over: England 54-2 (Root 18, Denly 19) Root is beaten, feeling for a hot one from Pattinson. You can really sense Root\u2019s determination to get runs, a matchwinning 160 not out even, but he\u2019s fighting a losing battle. Four years ago he was the feelgood star of England\u2019s Ashes victory; it\u2019s been a while since we\u2019ve seen that boyish smile, or his Bob Willis impression. 22nd over: England 53-2 (Root 18, Denly 19) Root again sweeps a single round the corner off Lyon, who generously gives Root a comprehensive analysis of the risks of such a shot on a pitch offering bounce. He is such a cocksure bowler; brilliant to play with, irritating as hell to play against. 21st over: England 52-2 (Root 17, Denly 19) Denly survives a torrid end to the over. He is beaten, chasing a very wide delivery from Pattinson, and then gloves a vicious bouncer over the slips for a couple. Superb bowling. \u201cThe bowling was consistently faster and meaner in the 1970s and 1980s than it is now...\u201d says Deepak. \u201cYet players used to rarely get hit in the head.\u201d Helmets changed everything. They gave batsmen an extra security which allowed many to take more liberties and/or stop watching the ball. I was talking to Robin Smith about this the other day and he said that, even while wearing a helmet, he always had an imaginary length in mind \u2013 if the ball pitched short of that, he would hit the deck as quickly as possible. 20th over: England 49-2 (Root 17, Denly 17) Root sweeps Lyon round the corner for a single, and receives a few words when he gets up the other end. \u201cAfternoon Rob,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cEnglish cricket, eh? This is wonderful stuff. It\u2019s like 1999 / 2003 / 2007 all over again. Except this time, England have the World Cup. It came home! Maybe this Test will go to a super over..?!\u201d Let\u2019s accentuate the positive, sort of: imagine how much more excruciating this Ashes shellacking would be had they gone out of the World Cup at the group stage. WICKET! Now that\u2019s what I call banter. Thanks Adam, hello everyone. England\u2019s two Joes are fighting desperately to repel some volcanic Australian bowling, and will resume their labours after the drinks break. 19th over: England 47-2 (Root 16, Denly 16) Pattinson is racing in off his very long run, this time a fraction fuller to Root and doing enough to win an edge. It goes through the gap in the cordon on the bounce for four, but it is a good sign. That\u2019s drinks, which means it is time for me to hand over to Rob. Thanks for your company this week. With it very unlikely we\u2019ll still be here on Monday, I\u2019ll talk to you again from Old Trafford. Bye! 18th over: England 42-2 (Root 11, Denly 16) Lyon for Hazlewood, Root gabbing one around the corner early in the over, Denly leaping onto the front foot to play a really nice shot over mid-off to finish. That takes him to 16, a new top score for England in this game. Okay, we can stop talking about that now. Unless Root overtakes him. Avitaj Mitra has a query. \u201cConsidering the number of times the batsmen have been hit on both sides (not just on the helmet, but also the arm and upper body), how much of this is just exceptional short pitched bowling and how much is it due to really poor technique while specifically playing the short ball?\u201d Former players always say it is about technique in the helmet era. But it\u2019s worth remembering that the bowling is so much quicker (consistently, before someone yells about Tyson) now compared to then. Like most things in life, probably a combination of factors. 17th over: England 37-2 (Root 10, Denly 12) Pattinson does get a go, on for Cummins down the hill, as was the case yesterday. As Michael Vaughan notes on TMS, Root doesn\u2019t mind pushing at balls just short of a length, which is where the big quick has started. The skipper keeps the strike with one off his hip. He\u2019s into double figures! \u201cIf OBO readers are going to habituate in Cawthorne,\u201d says John Starbuck, \u201cthey should make a point of going up the hill to the Spencer Arms for excellent beer and restaurant-level food. Also, the nearby Cannon Hall has a Food &amp; Drink Festival this weekend.\u201d Leeds Festival here right now, Carnival at Notting Hill on Monday. Alternatively: Dulwich Hamlet hosting Slough Town, where I\u2019ll be. 16th over: England 36-2 (Root 9, Denly 12) Hazlewood is such a dependable bowler, giving Denly nothing. What wonderful trolling it would be if he does on to make a ton here. \u201cNow England\u2019s biggest partnership,\u201d notes Simon Porter. Yep - and they\u2019re put on 21. 15th over: England 36-2 (Root 9, Denly 12) Shout for leg before... off the arm! Denly ducks into Cummins, per Tendulkar v McGrath in 1999. Not out is the call, Paine deciding not to go upstairs. Gee, it\u2019s close too - only about four inches from the bails, the TV shows. The pattern continues for Denly, experiencing a close call early in the over but getting back on it, keeping the strike with one to mid-on. 14th over: England 35-2 (Root 9, Denly 11) More runs off the outside edge, this time Root the beneficiary of a false stroke. Played with soft hands, to be fair. He\u2019s able to leave alone the second half of the set. Pattinson to replace Hazlewood up the hill? Do it, Tim. \u201cComing home from a walk we wandered past Cawthorne Cricket Club in South Yorkshire where we sat and watched a very entertaining half hour,\u201d says Diana Powell. \u201cWhy not send a bus down the M1?\u201d It\u2019ll need to be a bus given there are no trains back to London today - or something like that. A good freelancer, I\u2019ll be blagging a ride. 13th over: England 31-2 (Root 5, Denly 11) Ohhh, Cummins is the proverbial coat of varnish away from Australia\u2019s third, carving back through Denly - so close to both his inside edge and bails. Earlier, he picked up four off the edge, squared up a treat. Denly is into double figures again! The only England player to achieve that in this match. \u201cI am doing the night shift,\u201d begins a nice email from Ramal Zanji, \u201cfeeding my young twins (who are now asleep on the couch either side of me) whilst watching the game with the sound largely muted and your commentary my \u2018wireless\u2019. Tired enough with the demands presented by the young ones, this strange yet mesmerising Ashes series has given me a rather raggedy appearance. As a refugee migrant to a small Australian country town as a young child, I quickly learned that sporting pursuits are largely tied to acceptance and became a pretty handy all rounder. It was Freddy Flintoff\u2019s compassion toward Brett Lee in *that* Ashes series that made me a passionate fan of the game. If this Test somehow ends up as a draw, do you think that England would be happy to extend a Visa and a spot in the team to an Australian from Afghanistan with an Indian mother and Persian father? It wouldn\u2019t be all that unusual really given the past few decades.\u201d 12th over: England 27-2 (Root 5, Denly 7) Hazlewood is angling in at Root, who plays out a maiden. What he would give for a long, meaningful stay at the crease over the next four or more hours. \u201cYou\u2019ll know the answer to this,\u201d insists Pete Salmon. Let\u2019s hope so. \u201cHas it ever happened before that in six innings in a row a team\u2019s top score has always been made in the same position? And that the position is number 4? And by two different batsmen, with three innings each? Where the second batsman replaced the first half way through the six innings? Has it?\u201d I definitely do not know that. But Andrew Samson might be able to work it out for me. I\u2019ll hit him up at the tea break. 11th over: England 27-2 (Root 5, Denly 7) It ends up quite a long delay, Denly defending the two full balls that complete the over. \u201cI know it\u2019s been said before,\u201d emails Romeo, \u201cbut for the best seats in the whole ground, at the rugby end, to be empty is more shameful than England\u2019s battting.\u201d From my vantage point, they look to all be on the second level in front of the glass rooms where the lunches/hospitality are on. I\u2019ve been guilty of going to those events and never leaving the room. Cummins hits Denly. An Archer-esque bouncer follows him and he\u2019s hit right on the front of the helmet. For the third time today we go through the formal process, now with the England team doctor. In keeping with the practice, he\u2019s given a replacement lid. Play on. 10th over: England 26-2 (Root 4, Denly 7) Hazlewood is attacking Root\u2019s stumps, the captain getting his blade down in time to get a single behind square. Denly gets under another bumper then flashes at the fuller ball that follows. This is tough going. Can he survive? 9th over: England 25-2 (Root 3, Denly 7) Cummins is hitting the radar up towards 90mph, beating Denly to begin with a ball that hits the seam and changes direction a treat. He\u2019s beaten again from the third ball. This has been an outstanding spell. Denly gets under a short one then defends with a straight bat to finish. Hanging in there. \u201cEngland all-out 212,\u201d predicts Leo Harvey. \u201cBut I still see in my befuddled England cricket fan mind Buttler hitting the winning runs. I\u2019m in Hong Kong, must be the jetlag.\u201d Suspect so. They aren\u2019t reaching 200 here. My guess: they\u2019re done here by 5pm. 8th over: England 25-2 (Root 3, Denly 7) Huge appeal! Hazlewood thinks he has Root for nothing but the noise he hears is bat hitting pad not ball. Paine wisely declines to review. Andrew Samson reveals on radio that only two England skippers - Botham and Hussain - have bagged an Ashes pair. Root won\u2019t join them though, stroking three off the back out behind point to get off the mark. Denly gets three himself to finish, driving nicely down the ground. \u201cGame on!\u201d says Geoff Wignall of the Kent veteran\u2019s arrival in the middle at No4. \u201cNow that there\u2019s an England batter out there with the proven ability to reach double figures.\u201d 7th over: England 19-2 (Root 0, Denly 4) Denly off the mark through the cordon! It was the pleave at its best, the ball hitting his bat after he withdrew it. A fast bouncer follows, but he gets out of the way. Just. Tremendous bowling. \u201cThat was a serious ball,\u201d Alastair Cook says of the Roy dismissal. \u201cI don\u2019t think many people are going to be hitting that one.\u201d Phwooooar! Pat Cummins is through Roy\u2019s defence! Beaten on the outside edge at pace, it crashes into his off-stump. It angled in a treat; the opener\u2019s feet were nowhere. This could be over before tea. Rinse and repeat! Hazlewood pitched this on the stumps but Burns had ample time to get his bat out of the way. Instead, he offered the blade with the ball clipping the shoulder of it on the way through to David Warner at first slip. Root, once again, is walking out too early. 6th over: England 15-1 (Roy 8) 5th over: England 13-0 (Burns 5, Roy 8) Cummins cuts Roy in half! There\u2019s a huge shout for caught behind but they elect not to send it upstairs. Good decision, based on the first replay. Roy does nicely to wait on the delivery that follows, clipping a couple. The crowd are right behind the hosts here, roaring for every run. I can\u2019t quite tell yet if they are serious or taking the you know what? Ooooh, I take back the generous words about the opening batsman: he wafts at the final ball of the over, well outside the off-stump. There\u2019s nothing to be gained playing at those, Jason. Not now. Nothing at all. It will be Cummins to Roy. We\u2019re back. PLAY! \u201cEngland need more than five times as many in the 4th innings as they got in the second,\u201d notes Jim Hart. \u201cAnyone know what the record is in a winning 4th innings chase?\u201d That would be, if I recall correctly, the West Indies at the Rec in 2003 vs Australia. They successfully made 418 in that chase. Oh, that snuck up on me... the players are back on the field! Some emails before we return. \u201cEngland,\u201d begins Peter Piper. \u201cCrap!\u201d There are a lot like this, funnily enough. \u201cSome lunchtime thoughts for the England batsmen,\u201d begins Kim Thonger, \u201cadapting S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard by replacing \u2018life\u2019 with \u2018batting\u2019. Batting can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards. Batting is not a problem to be solved, but a reality to be experienced. Especially poignant since he wrote \u2018Fear &amp; Trembling\u2019 and The Concept Of Anxiety.\u201d Off to join the lunch queue. Back in about 20 minutes. If you\u2019re looking for something to keep you company, Geoff and I interviewed James Pattinson after the Birmingham Test. He\u2019s a fantastic fella. 4th over: England 11-0 (Burns 5, Roy 6) In an effort to maybe get another from Cummins before the break, it is Lyon on to replace Hazlewood with three minutes on the clock. They tried him briefly at Burns yesterday, but he got out too quickly - hooking Cummins - which denied the spinner a proper spell. The left-hander pushes the first, a full toss, for a couple to midwicket. There are two men around the bat on the off side and Burns splits the two of them on the front foot - solid batting. He then cuts one to deep point, leaving Roy one to keep out with less than a minute to 1pm. He takes guard, killing enough time to make this the final ball of the session. He gets on the front foot, driving one to long-on to finish. The crowd give it big as they leave the field, thrilled that England have made it to the end of the fourth over without losing a wicket. Very good. 3rd over: England 7-0 (Burns 2, Roy 5) Hard hands! Roy pushes at Cummins rather than letting the ball come to him, the result a leading edge that so easily could have ended up with a catcher. Instead, it spits away past point for four, running across the square. \u201cHave England gone to the well once too often with Stokes?\u201d asks Niall Morrissey. \u201cHe\u2019s sort of key to the batting. He has had a very physical match so far, with little chance to rest up. If England are to have any chance here, the early order has to front up and grind away while he recovers.\u201d Very surprised he was bowled like that. We know from the sports science types how carefully \u2018loads\u2019 are managed spell to spell. 2nd over: England 3-0 (Burns 2, Roy 1) Roy is off the mark second ball with careful clip through square leg. Hazlewood\u2019s turn at Burns but there isn\u2019t a lot going on, the opener dealing with it tidily. Some news from the Australian camp, confirming that Steve Smith did bat for 15 minutes today, facing throw downs. \u201cHe will continue to be assessed with a view to playing the tour match in Derby.\u201d 1st over: England 2-0 (Burns 2, Roy 0) Good from Burns, keeping his cool and grabbing a single from the single from the final delivery of the over, turning Cummins around the corner. Due to the blow, that should mean we get four overs in before the break rather than five. Speaking of openers. \u201cWith Lancashire letting Haseeb Hameed go and Trescothic retiring, should Somerset give him a go?\u201d asks Vic Voronins. I doubt it will be that straightforward. But I did see Hameed\u2019s ton at Lord\u2019s this year. Let\u2019s hope he finds a way through. Cummins hits Burns! Second ball, he\u2019s got a delivery to jump off a length at the handle of the bat. Burns cops the whack rather than taking his hand off the blade. There\u2019s a bit of blood from his left thumb. It wasn\u2019t far from the man at short leg, either. After some attention from the medical staff, it looks like he will continue. The players are back. Cummins to Burns from the Kirkstall Lane End. Can England get to lunch unscathed? Let\u2019s find out. PLAY! Australia should get five overs in before lunch. A few emails before we come to that. \u201cTime to get the tin hats on,\u201d says David Seare. \u201cWhat will you do with your two spare days? Maybe you could offer cricket insight on street corners as a kind of \u2018crusker\u2019\u201d Good vibes for a fourth day, yeah? Freelancer here. \u201cLabuschagne is a common Afrikaans surname (Marnus is from an Afrikaans family in South Africa),\u201d notes Louwrens Botha. \u201cThe \u2018ch\u2019 is pronounced as a hard \u2018k\u2019 and the \u2018g\u2019 is pronounced like the Scottish \u2018ch\u2019. Have fun with that one. So it\u2019s sort of \u2018lah-buh-ska(ch)-knee\u2019, not like Champagne (or indeed Charlemagne).\u201d Handy, thanks. I should not that in the UAE last year he specifically asked us to address him as Labu-shane. For what it\u2019s worth. \u201cWe are all hoping England can survive until tea and so a little bit of thinking outside the box to confuse the Aussies,\u201d suggests Harshad Mistry. \u201cWe are going to be all out so at least let\u2019s try a new tactic. Let\u2019s reverse the batting order and open with Leach and Broad. Our lower has perfomed better than the top order. We have nothing to lose except losing so let\u2019s lose in a different way.\u201d Well, it was good enough for Bradman! \u201cAfternoon Adam.\u201d Hi, David Horn. \u201cPresumably, for maximum effect, England will close today on 203-4. Thereby allowing for the proper, overnight, brewing of hope, before being scuttled for 240 tomorrow morning.\u201d Ala Adelaide in 2017. Lovely morning, that. Then Hazlewood decided to knock Root over with the first ball and that was that. Fun! So, 75 runs added this morning. That\u2019s a win for the visitors. Stokes finishes with 3/46 from his 24 unchanged overs from the Football Stand End, Archer and Broad picking up two apiece. Lyon chops on! Archer finishes the job. England are set 359 to win. 75th over: Australia 246-9 (Lyon 9, Hazlewood 4) Whoa, Woakes has missed the bouncing ball on the fine leg rope! Should have been one, it is four instead. Stokes does close to finishing Hazlewood off with the yorker later in the over, but can\u2019t quite get under his blade. \u201cSo it\u2019s November 2021: the start of the next Ashes series,\u201d emails Paul Griffin. \u201cI\u2019m trying to think of the England selection. Time will have taken Jimmy and probably Broad from the bowling attack. So it\u2019s Jofra and Stokes plus two - unless England have Michael Owen-ed the former to the knackers yard by then. I\u2019ve no idea who will open; Root at 4, unless this series destroys him? Buttler to be in there somewhere? Any other survivors? It\u2019s a long way back from this, and we are only just half way through this series in days played.\u201d Always the game to play at the end of a losing Ashes campaign, isn\u2019t it? Australia lead by 358, so that might be a task for the pub tonight. 74th over: Australia 241-9 (Lyon 4, Hazlewood 4) The ball before Labuschagne fell might have influenced his error, only just getting out the way of another bouncer that trailed back at his lid. He was in the middle for 294 minutes - another excellent contribution. Hazlewood gets out the way of a short ball, then clips the yorker away for four! As you do! Glorious shot from the Australian No11. Urgh! They ran on the Denly misfield at third man, recovering well to fire a throw in to Bairstow who made a well-timed lunge. Labuschagne is out by about six inches, the TV umpire confirms. 73rd over: Australia 236-8 (Labuschagne 79, Lyon 4) Stokes again. What is going on with Woakes, I wonder? The lead is 348 by the end of the over, Lyon doing it really nicely - pulling a bouncer for two then hacking a couple more through midwicket. Labuschagne\u2019s turn. \u201cOh my goodness,\u201d says Jason Ali. \u201cHope has reared its ugly little head. The next 3-4 hours are going to be awful.\u201d False hope, the worst kind. I\u2019m sorry in advance. Pattinson is going to take 7/31, or something ridiculous. His turn to go big, I reckon. 72nd over: Australia 232-8 (Labuschagne 79, Lyon 0) Shot, Marnus! He makes a bit of room and lifts Archer over backward point, splitting the fielders in the deep for four. He takes the single on offer to midwicket from the third ball but gets the strike straight back via a leg bye. A good result, but Lyon will be at the business end next. \u201cI don\u2019t get the problems people profess about pronouncing Labuschagne,\u201d emails John Staruck, \u201csince they presumably know how to say Charlemagne, which is almost an anagram of it.\u201d We\u2019re doing a proper interview with him this week on The Final Word. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll come up. Actually, let\u2019s crowd-source. What else would you like Geoff and me to ask him about on the show? Come and watch us in Manchester with Jim Maxwell, if that\u2019s your thing. 71st over: Australia 226-8 (Labuschagne 74, Lyon 0) Lyon is far from convincing but gets to the end of the over. Will Labuschagne try to take down Archer, mindful that he might not have long left? Stokes gets a third wicket in this tireless spell! His short ball gets big on Cummins, who can only deflect to Burns in the gully. 70th over: Australia 226-7 (Labuschagne 74, Cummins 6) They took drinks during the concussion test, which Labuschagne has to pass for the second time this morning. There will be Dr Richard Saw merchandise before the summer is over, he\u2019s spent so much time out in the middle on camera. Another quick and short ball follows, the nuggety Queenslander up to the task lifting over the cordon for four! And again, angled at his chest, just kept out. And again, right on his armpit. Jofra Archer is in the game. \u201cAll these negative nellies wondering whether the match will still be running later today,\u201d writes Matt Dony. \u201cOf course it will! At this rate, Australia may as well bat on until just after lunch on Monday, and still be pretty confident of the win.\u201d Freelancers say YES to that. \u201cIs the first question Dr Saw asks Marnus in the Concussion Quiz, \u2018How do you pronounce your surname?\u2019\u201d laughs Romeo. I know one of the questions is the name of the Australian Prime Minister, which is quite good value given the chaos in Canberra over recent years. Archer hits Labuschagne again! Very similar to the blow at Lord\u2019s last week, the Queenslander tries to get out of the way but is collected on the bottom rung of the grille. And just like last Sunday, he was straight back onto his feet. Nevertheless, Dr Saw is back on the field to go through the formal process. He looks fine from here. 69th over: Australia 222-7 (Labuschagne 70, Cummins 6) Stokes again from the Football Stand End. He\u2019s now into his 22nd over on the trot, albeit over two days. He keeps charging in, too. Cummins, the new man, is off the mark with a boundary off the all-rounder, from the outside half of his bat behind point along the ground. England at 9/2 for the win at one betting shop, Boris Starling reports. Normally, I wouldn\u2019t put such a thing into the OBO, but, as he adds - quite rightly: \u201cIn the spirit of Headingley Ashes Tests, I\u2019ll only stick a tenner on them once those odds have drifted to 500/1.\u201d On other Headingley quirks, this is one of only two grounds where 300-plus has been successfully chased three times in the fourth innings. That\u2019s another via Andrew Samson. 1948, of course, 2001 with Butch and 2017 when Shai Hope completed his twin tons. Nicely bowled, Archer winning Pattinson\u2019s edge with a bit of extra bounce from around the wicket. It\u2019s well taken low to Root\u2019s left at first slip. The end of a handy partnership, worth 51. Australia now lead by 327. That\u2019s 100 Test catches for Root, Andrew Samson says. 68th over: Australia 215-7 (Labuschagne 70) 67th over: Australia 208-6 (Labuschagne 69, Pattinson 19) Alastair Cook is kind about Pattinson\u2019s technique on TMS, \u201che gets his trigger movement in early.\u201d Of course, he would remember his work from Trent Bridge in 2013. So close. Stokes beats him in defence early in the over, but the left-hander is playing down the line - there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, as Warner proved on Thursday. 66th over: Australia 207-6 (Labuschagne 69, Pattinson 18) Here\u2019s Jofra, who spent some time off the field yesterday with cramp. A single for each early on, as Archer moves through the gears. Oh, now the summer of fives continues! It comes from a third single to midwicket - of the quick variety - earning him four overthows when the ping at the non-strikers\u2019 end isn\u2019t on target. 65th over: Australia 200-6 (Labuschagne 68, Pattinson 12) Shot. Pattinson has a bit of width to work with and uses it well to cut Stokes away for four to move into double figures. A single to square leg to finish the over brings up Australia\u2019s 200. Their lead is 312. \u201cI\u2019m currently at work, will be here until 5,\u201d reports Max Cornell \u201cWhat are the chances that this match is over before my shift?\u201d On the evidence of the first half an hour, quite high. \u201cAlso, hoping someone can explain something to me that I just don\u2019t understand with my limited cricket knowledge (I love the sport but have never really dug deep enough into the ins and outs of it). How do the weather conditions affect the way the ball moves?\u201d Depends who you listen to. Some scientists say that the overhead conditions have absolutely no effect on the swing of a cricket ball. But every fast bowler in the world disagrees with that contention. 64th over: Australia 194-6 (Labuschagne 67, Pattinson 7) That is a BAD DROPPED CATCH, Bairstow diving in front of first slip with one glove, putting Labuschagne down. It was going straight to Root. Dear me. That\u2019s ugly cricket. Broad is gutted it shows. Earlier, he was driven through the covers for four. That set up the (should have been) wicket-taking delivery a treat, generating a lovely amount of movement. Sure enough, Labuschagne scores off the next ball, pulling a couple, then finishes with three more off his pads. An expensive and highly-frustrating over for the England spearhead. 63rd over: Australia 183-6 (Labuschagne 56, Pattinson 7) Pattinson is looking pretty good so far today, dealing with Stokes from around the wicket without any concerns. Maiden. \u201cI\u2019m no fan of Root as captain,\u201d begins Matt Jones, an England fan in Sydney. Years ago, I knew an English Matt Jones in Sydney. The same guy? \u201cI would much rather see him in the team as a focused batsman. But I do feel he\u2019s not being well served by the pressure to bat at three. When do we get to put an end to the nonsense of \u2018your best batsman should go in at first drop\u2019? Look at Australia this series...over a third of their total runs this series have come from whoever they\u2019ve had batting at four (and well over half of their runs that have truly mattered). There\u2019s been minimal contribution from their top three and yet no obvious pressure on Smith or Labuschagne to move up to three. Anyway I\u2019m just clutching at straws to whinge about in the face of yesterday\u2019s batting fiasco.\u201d Michael Vaughan is big on this too, wanting Root back to four right away. Maybe he\u2019ll bat there in the second dig? 62nd over: Australia 183-6 (Labuschagne 56, Pattinson 7) Labuschagne has been hit on the head again. Nothing to worry about; it has only clipped his lid when missing a Broad bouncer on the hook shot. But Dr Saw is out there doing yet another concussion test, presumably, and all is well. Four runs came from it, leg byes the signal after being being given as runs initially - corrected by Umpire Wilson. Back to it, Broad beats him with a good\u2019un to finish. That\u2019s the first we\u2019ve seen it hoop this morning. Maybe some reverse? \u201cLoving \u2018Rob Smyth later\u2019 in the OBO cast list for the day,\u201d says Simon Yates. \u201cProper optimism to think England might make it till Rob\u2019s stint.\u201d I thought that too. But maybe these two bat big? 61st over: Australia 178-6 (Labuschagne 56, Pattinson 6) Stokes to Labuschagne, who is into a good contest already with the England all-rounder, forced to make good decisions against a couple of sharp and accurate bumpers. I\u2019m mindful of how much pressure Root is under, but I am a bit worried for Stokes\u2019 body. There\u2019s a reason bowlers who touch 90mph don\u2019t bowl unchanged, as he did yesterday for about 15 overs before the close. Some thoughts from Graham O\u2019Reilly. \u201cWhat I find hard to believe is that Graham Thorpe, one of the most pugnacious and technically adept batsmen of recent times, on whom you could always rely to fight it out in a crisis, is letting his charges play like that. Has he been obliged to buy into the stuff of \u201cgo out there and express yourselves\u201d ? Does he give them the rounds of the kitchen when they come back in after another stupid and unnecessary shot ? If not, why not?\u201d 60th over: Australia 178-6 (Labuschagne 56, Pattinson 6) Pattinson gets his first runs of the day, albeit off the edge, but along the ground for four. That\u2019ll do. He said to me a couple of years ago that he wants to be a Test No7. Based on what we\u2019ve seen of him at First Class level, he can definitely play. A good opportunity for him to bat for a couple of hours today, do it properly, and help Labuschagne get to 100 in Test cricket for the first time. On TMS, Agnew is on one: he wants the two divisions of the championship scrapped and some counties scrapped. Michael Vaughan agrees with him. Interesting. 59th over: Australia 173-6 (Labuschagne 55, Pattinson 2) Stokes, who was excellent yesterday in his marathon spell, opens up from the Football Stand End. Labuschagne, who copped another whack to the groin this morning in practice, is defending and ducking then tucking his second single of the morning. Pattinson leaves the rest. I\u2019m going to get ahead of the curve today by googling before I\u2019m asked: HERE IS THE OVERSEAS TMS LINK. 58th over: Australia 172-6 (Labuschagne 54, Pattinson 2) Jonathan Agnew, off the top of the show on TMS, has declared yesterday the be the worst performance he has ever seen from England with the bat. Have that! Labuschagne gets Australia\u2019s first run for the day, clipping one to square leg. Pattinson deals with the rest, employing the Steve Smith Leave. They\u2019re all into it these days. The players are on the field. Good morning to you all. Broad has the ball in his hand, running away from me at the Kirkstall Lane End. He\u2019ll be running in at Labuschagne, who resumes on 53. PLAY! Right, Adam Collins is here so I\u2019m going to take my leave and enjoy the action. Thanks, as always, for your correspondence. Please redirect your emails to adam.collins.casual@theguardian.com and tweets to @collinsadam. Oliver Atkinson has brought the gallows humour. \u201cThe best case scenario for England is some quick wickets followed by another innings lasting less than 30 overs, the injection of hope into this test team will only lead to more pain.\u201d Ben Heywood has sent in a very sensible email (I\u2019ll come to my \u201cbut\u201d later). \u201cWith respect, I think David Gaskell has it bum-about-face. If we somehow manage to limit the Aussie lead to 320 - and leave ourselves the best part of five sessions to attempt to chase it down, breaking all sorts of records in the process (as if!) - we must approach it with one simple mantra; Do Not Get Out. Think Edgbaston 05 from the Aussie perspective. There are overs aplenty to work with, our batsmen should try and get close enough to make them nervous as hell before we then see if we can pull off one of the biggest steals in test history. Leave the wide balls alone. Decide to score only in risk free areas. Get them in singles. Of course, we\u2019ll subside for a flashy 150 instead, most of them from a marooned Buttler, won\u2019t we?\u201d But the problem is batting in that manner is not familiar to these players. I wish I could remember the exact piece but someone wrote a story recently quoting AB de Villiers discussing batting for time and it was zen-like it is clarity that for ABdV the mindset is identical for a T20 as for dead-batting to save a Test. That\u2019s what made him so freakish. It is now abnormal to think batting for time is a simple concept, like it might have seemed a decade or two ago. Steve McAleer has the Journey spirit. \u201cIt seems to me the biggest collapse of yesterday is the support of the English squad. They were very unlucky not to win at Lord\u2019s, and if not for the will of the best batsman in the world, may have won at Edgbaston despite losing their strike bowler. Yesterday was a disaster, not the cataclysm of English red ball cricket.\u201d Josh Hazlewood is happy. I guess we might be starting with a few scars there. I mean, 60-odd is hard work to come back from during a Test. I don\u2019t think many teams are winning from there. It makes it difficult, so if we start well again next innings, they might think here we go again. So it\u2019s about creating that doubt in the mind. The way we have gone about it, it\u2019s not letting the foot off now. It\u2019s to keep going. Harry Lang is an evil genius. \u201cWe laud praise with names etched into the board at Lord\u2019s for big scores and \u2018Fifers\u2019 so why not introduce a wall of shame to remind players what happens when they capitulate with such a dearth of spirit? The engraver\u2019s chisel would\u2019ve looked like Andy Dufresne\u2019s rock hammer after yesterday.\u201d I think this idea is contrary to the spirit of cricket. But it\u2019s hard not to picture it. Best case? Skittle Australia out inside half-an-hour. Roy slashes 50 before lunch, setting the tone for a swashbuckling run-a-ball partnership with Joe Root that leaves around 100 to chase after Tea. With shadows lengthening over Headingley Root and Bairstow scamper the winning single while white roses cascade from the sky like snowflakes. Dickie Bird, Michael Parkinson, and Mel B sprint onto the ground to chair the local heroes from the field. Lovely email from Peter Salmon. \u201cQuick word in praise of Tim Paine, who seems to me the forgotten man in what is looking like an Ashes win. When he was appointed the smart money would have been on Australia falling apart after What Had Happened. Instead here we are. Lots of teams have talked about rotating bowlers but none have managed to make it happen, and yet the Australian bowlers have accepted it and played their roles. It speaks of a very harmonious dressing room, where it could have been carnage. Good, quiet, positive captaincy.\u201d Moreover, this is a likeable Australian team. They\u2019re winning an Ashes on English soil without rubbing anybody up the wrong way, spoiling for fights or headbutting the line. It\u2019s been refreshing to watch a keenly fought series play out in such a positive spirit. Paine deserves praise for that also. Gareth Frith is ready for a changing of the guard. \u201cWell, this does seem to have an end of an era feel about it. Bayliss is on the verge of going, and with him possibly the \u201cplay our own exciting brand of cricket\u201d mindset that Test fans have had to endure over the past couple of years. Collapse after collapse suggests something is wrong in the approach, not necessarily just the talent. As with other forms of gambling, when the fun stops, stop. And it stopped about four years ago. Having said that, you have to pick the right players, and along with Denly and Roy I\u2019d put a big question mark on Bairstow\u2019s head, and that of Buttler. England have lucked out in having Archer come in, they have to look at the next Ashes series in Australia with him, Stone and Wood possibly fronting up a very exciting attack which they\u2019ve not had in a long time, and use these next Test series to strengthen them as a unit. Leach looks to have the right temperament as a spinner who could hold an end down and do a useful if unspectacular job, which is what is required, a job Anderson can also do home and abroad if he\u2019s still around. The batting needs serious work if this bowling talent is not to be squandered, and some of the senior members need to realise they\u2019re not undroppable. It\u2019s happened too often, and a number have had enough chances. We\u2019ve won the World Cup, it was a superb achievement but it\u2019s high time the focus was put back on making county and Test cricket more attractive than it is currently.\u201d An email from Malaysia. \u201cCelebrating my father\u2019s 80th birthday this evening - warming up with a gin and tonic in anticipation of a grand evening. Asked dad just now what his wish was and his answer was for the English top three to score at least 80, ideally on an individual level; for Buttler to keep and captain, and for Joe to simply focus on what\u2019s he\u2019s best at. Happy birthday Arthur Rodwell (Pops) - push on to those nervous 90s. Richard, Nick &amp; Dylan.\u201d Congratulations on making 80 Arthur, and converting your age into a run-scoring wish. Although, I\u2019d be happy if a similar request came in from someone on their 50th, or even 30th birthday! Here\u2019s your day three pitch. The flip side of England\u2019s despair is, of course, Australia\u2019s delight. Geoff Lemon salutes the tyros who bowled their side to the brink of victory. For Australia\u2019s fast bowlers this year\u2019s Ashes has been all about versatility and balance. Like one of those Chinese tile puzzles, pieces have been slotted into and out of place in a careful and deliberate line of progress towards an eventual aim. The right components have been employed at the right time. The same has applied on the field, where tactical approaches have shifted with the moment. \u201cMy 90-year old dad has come down from Aberdeen for two days of the Test and suffered through yesterday. Is it too much to hope for a comeback to salve an old mans soul?\u201d There\u2019s always hope, Jane MacDonald. That topic of England\u2019s inability to prepare for both the Ashes and the World Cup simultaneously also pops up in Andy Bull\u2019s latest column. In the past two years this Test team have been so completely overshadowed by Eoin Morgan\u2019s one-day side. In fact, the two of them have grown closer together than the England and Wales Cricket Board ever intended them to. When Andrew Strauss overhauled English cricket in 2015, he imagined they would grow into two separate teams in two separate streams, but as the last four years went on they started to blend together. They could not, but simply because the one-day team has been so much more successful. So the struggling Test team has looked to them for personnel and inspiration, even though their freewheeling philosophy, sell wickets cheap, pile runs high, is desperately ill-suited to this format. \u201cThe fat lady sends her regrets\u201d is the title of an email from David Gaskell that I am obviously eager to read. \u201cReminds me of a poem during the Cuban missile crisis. On the bus to work in the morning everyone was convinced it would be a nuclear holocaust, the end of the world. So everyone on the bus made out with those they had fancied every morning. The poem ends, on the way home that night everyone was embarrassed. Same today, given a target of around 320, treat it as a fifty over match.\u201d I can see the logic, I\u2019m just struggling to see the execution based on England\u2019s batting (and Australia\u2019s bowling) so far this series. Tim Smith disagrees with my suggestion that prioritising a home World Cup over the Ashes was worthwhile for England. \u201cAs any true cricket lover knows the long form is the pinnacle of the sport. Anything less is an accommodation to generate revenue, pure and simple. As such any Test playing authority who puts short form above long form is not worthy of their position. As an aside, I also question that England won the World Cup... Ever since short form cricket started if scores are tied the team losing the least wickets wins (i.e. the Kiwis). The super over seems like yet another contrivance to meet the needs of poorly informed cricket fans who like the bish bash bosh and need a winner to satisfy them. One of the greatest sporting series in the last few years, All Blacks v The Lions ended as a draw - there were no losers, both sides (everyone) was a winner!?\u201d Ali Martin has begun the process of putting another England collapse into some kind of perspective. The point to all this, as the Ashes slip out of Root\u2019s reach, is that, if England are to keep the tail burning on the Archer comet, they must identify and develop specialist red-ball batsmen who put a high price on their wicket and can give the guy a break. With the widely disliked 100-ball caper crashing into the height of the English summer next year, this will not be easy. Australian supporter Jane Evans is sounding the hubris klaxon! \u201cPlease Jonathan, don\u2019t! Below the line several regular and knowledgeable English posters warn of the dreaded Hubris Klaxon. I have enough English ancestry in the mix to feel a cold and sinking dread seep in underneath any warm and uplifting hope for an Australian victory. No counting chickens.\u201d Nick Bampton is in early with his RADICAL PLAN FOR ENGLISH CRICKET. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll receive plenty of these throughout the day, although I\u2019m not convinced the concept of rotating openers is going to catch on. \u201cNew Head Coach: Eoin Morgan. New Test Captain: Ben Stokes. Test Team: Burns, Sibley / Vince (RO - opens on rotational basis), Root (RO), Stokes (RO), Pope / Roy (RO), Bairstow, Buttler, Woakes, Broad, Archer, Leach. The idea behind rotating openers is that nobody gets lumbered with the tag of opener, it\u2019s just your turn, don\u2019t put yourself under pressure to play like an opener, just give it ago, next week(or inns) it won\u2019t be you. If Sheffield United can make overlapping centre backs work, then surely England can make rotating openers work.\u201d Dan Read, from Essex, opens the emails with something of a melancholic haiku. \u201cSetting off to Leeds in a few hours as I have a ticket for Sunday. Hope springs eternal.\u201d If you go via the A1, make sure you stop off around Stamford for a pork pie. Weather: Headingley will be bathed in warm sunshine today. Conditions will be ideal for watching and playing cricket. Expect a raucous Western Terrace long before the close of play. If yesterday\u2019s chaos was too much of a blur to digest, allow Vic Marks to remind you what happened. This was the day when the poverty of English batsmanship in this form of the game was laid bare. The Ashes hung in the balance; there was scope for England to bat with hope having dismissed Australia for 179 on the first day. The sun, supposedly the batsman\u2019s friend at Headingley, was out. I\u2019m around for the next hour or so before play begins. If you want to riff on England\u2019s pain, or perhaps celebrate Australia\u2019s impending victory, you can drop me an email or a tweet. Hello everybody and welcome to live OBO coverage of the third day of the third Test from Headingley. This is the midpoint of the Ashes, but it may well be the final day of the summer during which the destination of the urn is unconfirmed. After two and a half Tests Australia have earned themselves a 1-0 series advantage and such an ascendancy at Leeds it seems only a matter of when, and not if, they secure the victory required to take an unassailable lead. When the 2019 Ashes is distilled by documentarians and diarists, yesterday\u2019s commotion will feature prominently in the narrative arcs. Australia, skittled for under 200 on day one and missing their star player, obliterated England with sustained controlled aggression that had their hosts grasping at air. If one man was the difference at Edgbaston, something more profound flowered at Headingley. England now have plenty of soul searching to do. How can they arrest such an abysmal run of batting form at Test level? How do they handle Joe Root? After spending so much effort (rightly, in my opinion) on the World Cup cycle, what does the next strategic plan look like and when does it come into effect? How bare is the cupboard? By contrast, Australia have plenty of back-slapping to do. Their plan has come together superbly. In particular the rotation of the bowling attack to ensure hunger and fitness, and the acclimatisation of all squad members to English conditions. The visitors have established an edge over their World Cup weary hosts unfamiliar to Ashes contests for most of the past couple of decades. Or have I gone too soon? Could England pull off an \u201881 style miracle again? Are we in for a landmark \u201cI was there\u201d day of Test cricket? Probably not, but it\u2019s an excuse to needle drop the sound of mumsy acid wash denim.",

      "body": "<p>We are still here. When England were 15 for two in their seventh over with another 344 runs required for victory and 70 overs to be bowled in the day, swift exit possibilities were being explored. Now other possibilities, more unlikely but much more intriguing, have surfaced. In their pursuit of 359 for victory England were 156 for three at the close with Joe Root on home turf attempting to play the innings of his life. At stumps he was unbeaten on 75, which already constitutes his innings of the series.</p> <p>Nagging away at the back of the mind is the thought, \u201cThis is Headingley\u201d. Extraordinary things happen here in the fourth innings, which have involved a wide variety of protagonists: Donald Bradman, Bob Willis, Mark Butcher and Shai Hope spring to mind. On Saturday afternoon England looked to their ordinary Joes to join this list. At least Messrs Root and Denly, to borrow some Strine, have been \u201cpretty bloody ordinary\u201d up until now.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/aug/24/ashes-2019-england-v-australia-third-test-day-three-live-cricket\">Ashes 2019: England end on 156-3 chasing 359 v Australia, third Test day three \u2013\u00a0live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But in sun-kissed Leeds in front of a packed stadium who seemed to enjoy the occasion despite the absence of sixes or fireworks, there was something out of the ordinary as they battled to keep this match alive. After all, they batted together for 53 overs, almost twice as long as the entire team managed in the first innings, grinding out 136 runs in the process. They received a curious standing ovation when they registered a hundred partnership.</p> <p>The Joes had opted for the hard route out of the rut, the red ball route rather than the white. They grafted; they shunned wide deliveries; they blocked the straight ones and painstakingly gleaned their runs against an unrelenting Australia attack. After 50 overs, when it is customary to make a note, England\u2019s score was 125 for two, an unusual state of affairs in this World Cup summer.</p> <p>The Joes were separated midway through the final session during another exceptional spell from Josh Hazlewood. Denly had been peppered with short deliveries throughout his innings, especially from Pat Cummins. Sometimes he ducked calmly, at others he fended in some discomfort and, as so often happens now, he was hit on the helmet as well. Throughout he remained resolute, moving into line and deflecting his runs amid the odd wayward drive. He has played many more beautiful innings in county cricket but few gutsier ones and he has never batted in such a tense situation. In the end a bouncer surprised him \u2013 partly because Hazlewood does not bowl so many \u2013 and he gloved a catch to the keeper.</p> <p>Root, meanwhile, reminded us why he is a class above the rest of England\u2019s batsmen; he had a fraction more time to decide how to cope with those shorter deliveries. Once he had avoided his pair \u2013 with an early cut shot off his recent tormentor, Hazlewood, he settled in to play an innings of old-style discretion. There were no expansive drives but many soft deflections on either side of the wicket. He let the ball come to him and usually he had enough time to deal with it. Like Denly he was prepared to play the long game, to try to wear down his opponents, not that the Australians at any stage suggested that they were running out of fuel.</p> <p>Their bowlers certainly started at full throttle. Rory Burns soon edged a steep lifter from Hazlewood into the increasingly safe hands of David Warner at slip. Then Jason Roy was bowled by a trimmer from Cummins, which clipped the top of his off-stump.</p> <p>So a fast game was in prospect. Batting still seemed a trial out there even when the Australians were at the crease. They managed to add another 75 in the morning but with enough uncertainty to suggest that the match might be over by the close.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"920e859f2eb9715ed37deb3aca206571b75b05b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/920e859f2eb9715ed37deb3aca206571b75b05b0/0_0_6840_4560/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marnus Labuschagne of Australia is struck by a delivery from Jofra Archer.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marnus Labuschagne of Australia is struck by a delivery from Jofra Archer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ben Stokes was selected to accompany Stuart Broad at the start and he would bowl throughout the session, which meant that, apart from a four-ball interruption from Jofra Archer on Friday night, he ran in from the Rugby Stand End for 24 consecutive overs. The impression was that Root may have struggled to remove the ball from his hands even if he had wanted a change from that end.</p> <p>England looked grumpy out there, not surprisingly given their situation; Marnus Labuschagne, such a familiar figure now, was still calm and measured in between being hit on the head by a cricket ball \u2013 he took two more blows in the morning session \u2013 and he remained a formidable obstacle. On 60 he gave a tough chance to Jonny Bairstow off Stuart Broad that fell to ground. Broad did not quite succeed in hiding his disappointment as he flicked the ball along the ground to his keeper at the end of the over.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>It looked like another one of those days especially after the donation of four overthrows \u2013 fortunately off the bowling of Archer, which meant that there were no volcanic eruptions out there. Then, after starting gingerly, Archer found the edge of James Pattinson\u2019s bat and Root took the catch. Stokes\u2019s sweat was justifiably rewarded with the wicket of Cummins, who was fending off a short delivery.</p> <p>Soon Labuschagne became the first batsman in the series to be run out. A square drive sped out to Denly on the point boundary. There was a misfield, but only a little one, which encouraged Labuschagne back for a second; Denly gathered the ball and his throw was swift and straight into the gloves of Bairstow who gathered the ball smoothly. To mild surprise Labuschagne was a couple of inches from home when the bails were removed. Soon Nathan Lyon was bowled off the bottom edge by Archer, the 13th wicket of his brief Test career. The target was set. It is a formidable one. But we are still here.</p>",

At stumps he was unbeaten on 75, which already constitutes his innings of the series. Nagging away at the back of the mind is the thought, \u201cThis is Headingley\u201d. Extraordinary things happen here in the fourth innings, which have involved a wide variety of protagonists: Donald Bradman, Bob Willis, Mark Butcher and Shai Hope spring to mind. On Saturday afternoon England looked to their ordinary Joes to join this list. At least Messrs Root and Denly, to borrow some Strine, have been \u201cpretty bloody ordinary\u201d up until now. But in sun-kissed Leeds in front of a packed stadium who seemed to enjoy the occasion despite the absence of sixes or fireworks, there was something out of the ordinary as they battled to keep this match alive. After all, they batted together for 53 overs, almost twice as long as the entire team managed in the first innings, grinding out 136 runs in the process. They received a curious standing ovation when they registered a hundred partnership. The Joes had opted for the hard route out of the rut, the red ball route rather than the white. They grafted; they shunned wide deliveries; they blocked the straight ones and painstakingly gleaned their runs against an unrelenting Australia attack. After 50 overs, when it is customary to make a note, England\u2019s score was 125 for two, an unusual state of affairs in this World Cup summer. The Joes were separated midway through the final session during another exceptional spell from Josh Hazlewood. Denly had been peppered with short deliveries throughout his innings, especially from Pat Cummins. Sometimes he ducked calmly, at others he fended in some discomfort and, as so often happens now, he was hit on the helmet as well. Throughout he remained resolute, moving into line and deflecting his runs amid the odd wayward drive. He has played many more beautiful innings in county cricket but few gutsier ones and he has never batted in such a tense situation. In the end a bouncer surprised him \u2013 partly because Hazlewood does not bowl so many \u2013 and he gloved a catch to the keeper. Root, meanwhile, reminded us why he is a class above the rest of England\u2019s batsmen; he had a fraction more time to decide how to cope with those shorter deliveries. Once he had avoided his pair \u2013 with an early cut shot off his recent tormentor, Hazlewood, he settled in to play an innings of old-style discretion. There were no expansive drives but many soft deflections on either side of the wicket. He let the ball come to him and usually he had enough time to deal with it. Like Denly he was prepared to play the long game, to try to wear down his opponents, not that the Australians at any stage suggested that they were running out of fuel. Their bowlers certainly started at full throttle. Rory Burns soon edged a steep lifter from Hazlewood into the increasingly safe hands of David Warner at slip. Then Jason Roy was bowled by a trimmer from Cummins, which clipped the top of his off-stump. So a fast game was in prospect. Batting still seemed a trial out there even when the Australians were at the crease. They managed to add another 75 in the morning but with enough uncertainty to suggest that the match might be over by the close. Ben Stokes was selected to accompany Stuart Broad at the start and he would bowl throughout the session, which meant that, apart from a four-ball interruption from Jofra Archer on Friday night, he ran in from the Rugby Stand End for 24 consecutive overs. The impression was that Root may have struggled to remove the ball from his hands even if he had wanted a change from that end. England looked grumpy out there, not surprisingly given their situation; Marnus Labuschagne, such a familiar figure now, was still calm and measured in between being hit on the head by a cricket ball \u2013 he took two more blows in the morning session \u2013 and he remained a formidable obstacle. On 60 he gave a tough chance to Jonny Bairstow off Stuart Broad that fell to ground. Broad did not quite succeed in hiding his disappointment as he flicked the ball along the ground to his keeper at the end of the over. It looked like another one of those days especially after the donation of four overthrows \u2013 fortunately off the bowling of Archer, which meant that there were no volcanic eruptions out there. Then, after starting gingerly, Archer found the edge of James Pattinson\u2019s bat and Root took the catch. Stokes\u2019s sweat was justifiably rewarded with the wicket of Cummins, who was fending off a short delivery. Soon Labuschagne became the first batsman in the series to be run out. A square drive sped out to Denly on the point boundary. There was a misfield, but only a little one, which encouraged Labuschagne back for a second; Denly gathered the ball and his throw was swift and straight into the gloves of Bairstow who gathered the ball smoothly. To mild surprise Labuschagne was a couple of inches from home when the bails were removed. Soon Nathan Lyon was bowled off the bottom edge by Archer, the 13th wicket of his brief Test career. The target was set. It is a formidable one. But we are still here.",

      "bodyText": "Championship Leeds continued their excellent start to the season and stayed top after a strolling 3-0 win at struggling Stoke. Goals from Stuart Dallas, a tap-in from Ezgjan Alioski after fine work from Patrick Bamford, who scored the third, ensured Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s side stay unbeaten. Stoke have collected just one point and manager Nathan Jones saw no return on dropping England goalkeeper Jack Butland and midfielder Joe Allen. Charlton are themselves still unbeaten and just two points behind. Conor Gallagher\u2019s third goal of the season, against the run of play, secured a 1-0 victory at the Valley over Brentford. Sheffield Wednesday dropped out of the top six after losing 2-1 at Preston, where they have not won since 2012, after two penalties from Daniel Johnson. Fulham\u2019s run of three successive wins was brought to a halt by two goals from Nottingham Forest\u2019s Lewis Grabban, the first coming in just the fourth minute. Aleksandar Mitrovic\u2019s late strike served only as a consolation for the Cottagers. Huddersfield, still without a manager after Jan Siewert\u2019s sacking early last week, lost 2-0 at home to Reading. The Royals waited until the 71st minute to score through Ovie Ejaria before Michael Morrison headed in 13 minutes later. Huddersfield are only above Stoke on goal difference. Bristol City are up to fourth place after late goals from Benik Afobe and Reece Burke secured a 3-1 win at Hull. Afobe, on loan from Stoke, opened the scoring for City. Middlesbrough were in the lead for just six minutes after Paddy McNair\u2019s 70th minute strike before Tom Bradshaw, with his first touch after coming on as a sub, equalised for Millwall in a 1-1 draw. Wigan stay rooted in the bottom three after losing 3-1 at QPR. The Hoops recovered from C\u00e9dric Kipr\u00e9\u2019s second-minute strike with Nahki Wells\u2019 effort from close range, an Ebere Eze free-kick and a goal from substitute Jordan Hugill completing the turnaround. Teetering above are Barnsley, who lost 3-1 at home to Luton. The Hatters were three goals up by the 31st minute as Jacob Butterfield, James Collins and Harry Cornick all scored. Barnsley, unable to win since the opening day, got their sole goal via Mallik Wilks. Blackburn and Cardiff, 14th and 15th respectively, fought out a 0-0 draw at Ewood Park. League One The top of the third tier could not be closer, with no fewer than five teams level on 11 points, and sixth-placed Fleetwood, who beat Accrington 2-0, on 10 points. Leading on goal difference are Ipswich, having shown no mercy to managerless, troubled Bolton. The Trotters were again forced to field a highly youthful team and were playing in front of the lowest league crowd in the 22-year history of their current stadium. James Norwood and Kayden Jackson both scored twice for Town, with Gwion Edwards getting the other. Blackpool blew the chance to be top after drawing 0-0 at Rochdale. The thriller of the day came in third-placed Wycombe\u2019s 4-3 defeat of Southend. Goals in the 89th and 90th minute from Anthony Stewart and Scott Kashket, respectively, took the three points. Southend no points, with only crisis clubs Bolton and Bury below them. Chris Maguire scored all three goals in a 3-1 win for Sunderland against AFC Wimbledon, to land a third successive win. And completing that leading quintet are Coventry, who beat Gillingham 1-0. League Two There is a distinct West Country flavour to the promotion positions. A 3-2 win for Exeter at Morecambe, the winner coming via Nicky Law, kept them top, above Devon rivals Plymouth, who beat Walsall 3-0, with Ryan Taylor scoring twice. His first gave Argyle an early lead, only for a 69-minute wait for Antoni Sarcevic to score the second \u2026 before he was sent off. Forest Green are third after late drama at Bradford. Joseph Mills headed the winner in the third minute of added time, and his brother, Matt Mills, was dismissed five minutes later after a second bookable offence. Daryl McMahon celebrated his first win as Macclesfield manager after Joe Ironside\u2019s goal secured a 1-0 defeat of rock-bottom Scunthorpe. Macc are in fourth.",

      "body": "<p>Boris Johnson will sit down for breakfast on Sunday morning with a man he once famously described as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/09/a-revolting-slug-what-politicians-said-before-trump-got-elected\" title=\"\">betraying a quite stupefying ignorance that makes him frankly unfit to hold the office of president of the United States</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Not too long after Johnson made that remark, Donald Trump went on to win that office. And today Johnson \u2013 having defied similar assessments of his own fitness for the highest office \u2013 will come face to face with him at the H\u00f4tel du Palais in Biarritz, on the sidelines of the G7 summit, in his first major event on the international stage as prime minister.</p> <p>Both men rose to the top by portraying themselves as outsiders who were prepared to break some furniture in pursuit of an imagined national greatness. Now they must rearrange that furniture, or make some of their own.</p> <p>Johnson flew into Biarritz after meetings with his counterparts in Berlin and Paris, meetings which appear to have brought them no closer to a Brexit deal.</p> <p>At the three-day summit in Biarritz, amid the grandeur of the historic seaside resort on France\u2019s Atlantic coast, the prime minister will be under particular scrutiny. Every word and gesture from Johnson at this annual gathering of the world\u2019s major industrial democracies will be analysed for clues as to where he intends to position the UK on the gaping transatlantic divide between the US and Europe.</p> <p>If the past is any guide, the prime minister will try to avoid giving away that location, and if Trump has an interest in helping him, he will not put on him on the spot when it comes to issues and instincts on which the UK has thus far been on the European side.</p> <p>Those pivotal issues include UK support for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/08/iran-nuclear-deal-what-is-it-why-does-trump-want-to-scrap-it\" title=\"\">2015 nuclear deal with Iran</a>; backing for the Paris climate accord and acknowledgement of the urgency of the climate crisis, particularly against the blazing backdrop of the Amazon wildfires.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ab93cc852d1b517364bc71fc649ac972b8589c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ab93cc852d1b517364bc71fc649ac972b8589c9/10_14_2972_1783/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump and French president Emmanuel Macron at lunch before the G7 summit in Biarritz on Saturday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump and French president Emmanuel Macron at lunch before the G7 summit in Biarritz on Saturday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos Barr\u00eda/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The UK has maintained its support for an international rules-based system with multilateral institutions and free trade at its centre. It has promoted a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine and a rejection of both occupation and annexation of Palestinian territories. Britain has also maintained a firm line over the Russian military intervention in Ukraine and Moscow\u2019s annexation of Crimea, denying Russia readmission to the G7 club until it reverses those actions.</p> <p>These are all shibboleths of the liberal international order, and they are being challenged daily by the Trump administration. Would a no-deal Brexit mean that Britain felt under pressure to do the same?</p> <p>Since taking over as prime minister, Johnson has stuck to the consensus European script on all these critical foreign policy issues.</p> <p>He has restated his faith in the nuclear agreement and the need to defuse tensions in the Gulf, rather than tighten the US stranglehold on Iran.</p> <p>Johnson has also warned against the dangers of trade wars, in the face of Trump\u2019s worsening face-off with China, and he has stuck to European orthodoxy on the need to preserve the Paris accord on climate, and to build on it.</p> <p>Any substantial deviation at the G7 summit from such entrenched, shared positions would mean Johnson risking the toxic label of \u201cpoodle\u201d, which his predecessor Tony Blair never managed to shake off.</p> <p>The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is already framing Johnson as a \u201cTrump first\u201d prime minister, and there will be plenty of jilted European partners on hand to draw attention to British humiliation.</p> <p>Emmanuel Macron, when asked last week if he thought that Johnson and Trump would team up together in a united front against other Europeans at the G7, played on deep British fears about the future.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c174946e1cf4bfed2dd90dd096bd24e1f9bab9c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c174946e1cf4bfed2dd90dd096bd24e1f9bab9c7/0_112_3373_2024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"European Council president Donald Tusk warned Johnson he risked going down in history as \u2018Mr No Deal\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">European Council president Donald Tusk warned Johnson he risked going down in history as \u2018Mr No Deal\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Hartmann/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s Boris Johnson\u2019s project or the British people\u2019s project, as Britain leaves the EU saying it wants a bigger space in the world, to then become the junior partner of the US,\u201d the French president told reporters last week.</p> <p>He said any future trade deal between the US and the UK would not make up for the UK\u2019s geographical and strategic links to Europe, and a trade deal with the US could come at a high price for Britain: a \u201chistoric vassalisation\u201d to the US.</p> <p>It is unlikely Macron chose his words carelessly. Johnson first signalled his break from Theresa May at the end of 2017 by warning that the UK must not become a \u201cvassal state\u201d of Europe. With the EU, the UK had one of the bigger seats at the table, but in the absence of a withdrawal agreement with Europe, Britain approaches the US as a junior partner at best, a supplicant at worst.</p> <p>Johnson has insisted that he will defend British agriculture and the National Health Service against the predations of US corporations, but that will be harder if the UK crashes out of the EU without a deal, a course of action Trump and his administration have repeatedly advocated. Johnson\u2019s readiness to embrace such an outcome distinguishes him from Theresa May, and is arguably the most important reason Trump openly preferred him to his predecessor.</p> <p>On this issue at least, Johnson has, with his brinksmanship, placed himself closer to Trump and further from the EU. The European Council president, Donald Tusk, drily noted that when he meets Johnson on Sunday, he will be the third Tory prime minister with whom he has sat down to discuss Brexit. He warned Johnson on Saturday that he risked going down in history as \u201cMr No Deal\u201d.</p> <p>On the way to Biarritz, Johnson sought to defend his strategy of blaming Britain\u2019s EU partners for failing to come up with a solution to the Irish backstop impasse.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want a no-deal Brexit but I say to our EU friends if they don\u2019t want no deal they have got to get rid of the backstop from the treaty,\u201d Johnson told reporters. \u201cIf Donald Tusk doesn\u2019t want to go down in history as Mr No-Deal Brexit, then I hope this point will be borne in mind by him too.\u201d</p> <p>Trump, ironically for a self-proclaimed master of the deal, can be expected to continue to pull in the other direction, seeking to persuade the prime minister that \u201cMr No Deal\u201d would be a badge of pride.</p> <p>In the absence of specifics, both Trump and Johnson will seek to play up the manly bonhomie of a renewed \u201cspecial relationship\u201d. The US president will want to show he has at least one friend in Biarritz, the man he proudly referred to as \u201cBritain [sic] Trump\u201d, and has shown that he is prepared to overlook past slights in special circumstances.</p> <p>For his part, Johnson \u2013 who declared only a few years ago that the only reason he would avoid some parts of New York was \u201cthe real risk of meeting Donald Trump\u201d \u2013 must seek to show he can connect more successfully with the US president that his hapless predecessor.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a0b74d6a3b984440b18274fc725a77417d2a2d30\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0b74d6a3b984440b18274fc725a77417d2a2d30/421_930_4200_2520/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Johnson with Canadian PM Justin Trudeau in France on Saturday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Johnson with Canadian PM Justin Trudeau in France on Saturday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Both men will paint a rosy picture of a future US-UK trade deal, because the ugly reality of the negotiations can be put off until later. At some point post-Brexit, the UK will have to make a decision on whether its regulatory standards are to converge with the US or with the EU.</p> <p>It cannot do both. Converging with the US would be likely to involve breaking promises about British food, agriculture and animal welfare as well as the National Health Service.</p> <p>Moreover, any trade deal with the US would have to gain approval from Congress, and the House of Representatives will be in no mood to cooperate if Brexit has an impact on the Good Friday peace agreement in Northern Ireland.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson will sit down for breakfast on Sunday morning with a man he once famously described as \u201cbetraying a quite stupefying ignorance that makes him frankly unfit to hold the office of president of the United States\u201d. Not too long after Johnson made that remark, Donald Trump went on to win that office. And today Johnson \u2013 having defied similar assessments of his own fitness for the highest office \u2013 will come face to face with him at the H\u00f4tel du Palais in Biarritz, on the sidelines of the G7 summit, in his first major event on the international stage as prime minister. Both men rose to the top by portraying themselves as outsiders who were prepared to break some furniture in pursuit of an imagined national greatness. Now they must rearrange that furniture, or make some of their own. Johnson flew into Biarritz after meetings with his counterparts in Berlin and Paris, meetings which appear to have brought them no closer to a Brexit deal. At the three-day summit in Biarritz, amid the grandeur of the historic seaside resort on France\u2019s Atlantic coast, the prime minister will be under particular scrutiny. Every word and gesture from Johnson at this annual gathering of the world\u2019s major industrial democracies will be analysed for clues as to where he intends to position the UK on the gaping transatlantic divide between the US and Europe. If the past is any guide, the prime minister will try to avoid giving away that location, and if Trump has an interest in helping him, he will not put on him on the spot when it comes to issues and instincts on which the UK has thus far been on the European side. Those pivotal issues include UK support for the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran; backing for the Paris climate accord and acknowledgement of the urgency of the climate crisis, particularly against the blazing backdrop of the Amazon wildfires. The UK has maintained its support for an international rules-based system with multilateral institutions and free trade at its centre. It has promoted a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine and a rejection of both occupation and annexation of Palestinian territories. Britain has also maintained a firm line over the Russian military intervention in Ukraine and Moscow\u2019s annexation of Crimea, denying Russia readmission to the G7 club until it reverses those actions. These are all shibboleths of the liberal international order, and they are being challenged daily by the Trump administration. Would a no-deal Brexit mean that Britain felt under pressure to do the same? Since taking over as prime minister, Johnson has stuck to the consensus European script on all these critical foreign policy issues. He has restated his faith in the nuclear agreement and the need to defuse tensions in the Gulf, rather than tighten the US stranglehold on Iran. Johnson has also warned against the dangers of trade wars, in the face of Trump\u2019s worsening face-off with China, and he has stuck to European orthodoxy on the need to preserve the Paris accord on climate, and to build on it. Any substantial deviation at the G7 summit from such entrenched, shared positions would mean Johnson risking the toxic label of \u201cpoodle\u201d, which his predecessor Tony Blair never managed to shake off. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is already framing Johnson as a \u201cTrump first\u201d prime minister, and there will be plenty of jilted European partners on hand to draw attention to British humiliation. Emmanuel Macron, when asked last week if he thought that Johnson and Trump would team up together in a united front against other Europeans at the G7, played on deep British fears about the future. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s Boris Johnson\u2019s project or the British people\u2019s project, as Britain leaves the EU saying it wants a bigger space in the world, to then become the junior partner of the US,\u201d the French president told reporters last week. He said any future trade deal between the US and the UK would not make up for the UK\u2019s geographical and strategic links to Europe, and a trade deal with the US could come at a high price for Britain: a \u201chistoric vassalisation\u201d to the US. It is unlikely Macron chose his words carelessly. Johnson first signalled his break from Theresa May at the end of 2017 by warning that the UK must not become a \u201cvassal state\u201d of Europe. With the EU, the UK had one of the bigger seats at the table, but in the absence of a withdrawal agreement with Europe, Britain approaches the US as a junior partner at best, a supplicant at worst. Johnson has insisted that he will defend British agriculture and the National Health Service against the predations of US corporations, but that will be harder if the UK crashes out of the EU without a deal, a course of action Trump and his administration have repeatedly advocated. Johnson\u2019s readiness to embrace such an outcome distinguishes him from Theresa May, and is arguably the most important reason Trump openly preferred him to his predecessor. On this issue at least, Johnson has, with his brinksmanship, placed himself closer to Trump and further from the EU. The European Council president, Donald Tusk, drily noted that when he meets Johnson on Sunday, he will be the third Tory prime minister with whom he has sat down to discuss Brexit. He warned Johnson on Saturday that he risked going down in history as \u201cMr No Deal\u201d. On the way to Biarritz, Johnson sought to defend his strategy of blaming Britain\u2019s EU partners for failing to come up with a solution to the Irish backstop impasse. \u201cI don\u2019t want a no-deal Brexit but I say to our EU friends if they don\u2019t want no deal they have got to get rid of the backstop from the treaty,\u201d Johnson told reporters. \u201cIf Donald Tusk doesn\u2019t want to go down in history as Mr No-Deal Brexit, then I hope this point will be borne in mind by him too.\u201d Trump, ironically for a self-proclaimed master of the deal, can be expected to continue to pull in the other direction, seeking to persuade the prime minister that \u201cMr No Deal\u201d would be a badge of pride. In the absence of specifics, both Trump and Johnson will seek to play up the manly bonhomie of a renewed \u201cspecial relationship\u201d. The US president will want to show he has at least one friend in Biarritz, the man he proudly referred to as \u201cBritain [sic] Trump\u201d, and has shown that he is prepared to overlook past slights in special circumstances. For his part, Johnson \u2013 who declared only a few years ago that the only reason he would avoid some parts of New York was \u201cthe real risk of meeting Donald Trump\u201d \u2013 must seek to show he can connect more successfully with the US president that his hapless predecessor. Both men will paint a rosy picture of a future US-UK trade deal, because the ugly reality of the negotiations can be put off until later. At some point post-Brexit, the UK will have to make a decision on whether its regulatory standards are to converge with the US or with the EU. It cannot do both. Converging with the US would be likely to involve breaking promises about British food, agriculture and animal welfare as well as the National Health Service. Moreover, any trade deal with the US would have to gain approval from Congress, and the House of Representatives will be in no mood to cooperate if Brexit has an impact on the Good Friday peace agreement in Northern Ireland. The Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, has repeatedly said there is \u201cno way whatsoever\u201d a US-UK free trade deal would be approved if Brexit affected the border between the two Irelands. So whatever the upbeat noises about future trade Trump and Johnson make on Sunday, it will mean little in real terms. The rest will be mood music, and Johnson has shown himself adept in that department. The G7 is a big stage, but not a particularly challenging act. There are set scripts and orthodoxies to follow. But as ever, Trump is the wild card, constantly threatening to upset the comfortable western consensus of years past. If he so chooses, the president could set the rejuvenated special relationship with the man he has frequently called his friend, and force Johnson to make the hard choices he is hoping to postpone until after an election.",

Suffice it to say it is good to see him back and firing like this.</p> <p>Granted, this was his ninth straight appearance for England but we have seen his power, his pace and his poise only in glimpses. That can no longer be considered the case. He was not alone but he typified England\u2019s intensity, their ability to burst over the gainline and such is the obvious joy Tuilagi takes from playing international rugby that it must be infectious.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/aug/24/ireland-england-twickenham-cian-healy-conor-murray-johnny-sexton\">Battered Ireland leave Twickenham nursing World Cup injury headaches | Robert Kitson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For Tuilagi loves playing for England, all the more so against Ireland, and it was eight years ago that he ran amok in Dublin when winning only his second cap, rubber-stamping his place at the 2011 World Cup aged only 20.</p> <p>In February this year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/02/ireland-england-six-nations-match-report\" title=\"\">Tuilagi made his first England start in five years </a>and made a considerable impact after less than two minutes, taking Jamie George\u2019s over-the-top lineout and thundering into the Ireland defence.</p> <p>Yesterday, Ross Byrne acquitted himself well on his first Test start but he may live to regret directing his kick-off at Tuilagi, who fielded it and rampaged into his opponents. Eddie Jones is these days non-committal when asked whether Tuilagi is better suited to playing at No 12 or No 13. He started four of five Six Nations matches at inside-centre but on this evidence it seems hard to argue that he is not better suited to playing one out with that extra yard of space. Not least when he has George Ford and Owen Farrell inside him and surely this will not be the last time Jones deploys this trio in midfield from the start.</p> <p>Ireland were given a warning of Tuilagi\u2019s threat and how Ford and Farrell might combine to release him early on. He could not quite wriggle free the first time but did so the second and from there England embarked on a series of phases that led to Elliot Daly\u2019s try. Just before it, Tuilagi left a huge dent in the Ireland defence, creating the space for Daly to finish on the right. For his own score, he burst through a gap with the kind of acceleration he was showcasing eight years ago.</p> <p>He ended the first half with seven defenders beaten \u2013 equalling his best ever for a whole match, which was against Romania in 2011 \u2013 and after the break hit Jordan Larmour so hard that the Twickenham groundsman will be picking bits of the Ireland wing off the turf for the next few weeks.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/24/england-ireland-rugby-world-cup-warm-up-match-report\">Joe Cokanasiga scores twice as England turn on power to crush Ireland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Soon after he tracked Jacob Stockdale down the left and bundled him into touch. He was also in the thick of things for Joe Cokanasiga\u2019s second try, running a perfect decoy line after Ford and Farrell had combined. He does not even have to touch the ball to leave his imprint.</p> <p>Ben Youngs knows Tuilagi better than most, having come through the Leicester academy with him. On Friday he said he had never seen Tuilagi in better physical shape but perhaps more significantly, spoke of what a good place he was in mentally and perhaps the best thing that can be said about Tuilagi is that it is no longer necessary to hold one\u2019s breath whenever he gets the ball and sets off towards a wall of defenders, as was the case not so long ago. We often hear about how popular Tuilagi is off the pitch, how he rules the pool table and makes everyone coffee and seeing him in this kind of form is sure to rub off on his team-mates. \u201cHe\u2019s in a good place, he\u2019s got a smile on his face, he\u2019s getting fitter,\u201d said Jones.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s about 80 per cent fit, when he gets there he will be a handful. One of his best assets is that people like to play with him.\u201d</p> <p>Throughout his tenure, Jones has never liked answering questions about players absent from his squad. The mere utterance of Danny Cipriani has often been met with a quiet fury and more recently it has been Ben Te\u2019o off limits. Over the years he has always had time to talk about Tuilagi, however.

      "bodyText": "It may seem strange to single out one player after such an imperious England performance across the board but Manu Tuilagi is someone worth making an exception for. There have been countless days over the past five years when a performance such as this seemed beyond the realms of possibility. Just this week he laid bare the extent of his injury struggles and how hiding one of them cost him more than a year of his career. Suffice it to say it is good to see him back and firing like this. Granted, this was his ninth straight appearance for England but we have seen his power, his pace and his poise only in glimpses. That can no longer be considered the case. He was not alone but he typified England\u2019s intensity, their ability to burst over the gainline and such is the obvious joy Tuilagi takes from playing international rugby that it must be infectious. For Tuilagi loves playing for England, all the more so against Ireland, and it was eight years ago that he ran amok in Dublin when winning only his second cap, rubber-stamping his place at the 2011 World Cup aged only 20. In February this year, Tuilagi made his first England start in five years and made a considerable impact after less than two minutes, taking Jamie George\u2019s over-the-top lineout and thundering into the Ireland defence. Yesterday, Ross Byrne acquitted himself well on his first Test start but he may live to regret directing his kick-off at Tuilagi, who fielded it and rampaged into his opponents. Eddie Jones is these days non-committal when asked whether Tuilagi is better suited to playing at No 12 or No 13. He started four of five Six Nations matches at inside-centre but on this evidence it seems hard to argue that he is not better suited to playing one out with that extra yard of space. Not least when he has George Ford and Owen Farrell inside him and surely this will not be the last time Jones deploys this trio in midfield from the start. Ireland were given a warning of Tuilagi\u2019s threat and how Ford and Farrell might combine to release him early on. He could not quite wriggle free the first time but did so the second and from there England embarked on a series of phases that led to Elliot Daly\u2019s try. Just before it, Tuilagi left a huge dent in the Ireland defence, creating the space for Daly to finish on the right. For his own score, he burst through a gap with the kind of acceleration he was showcasing eight years ago. He ended the first half with seven defenders beaten \u2013 equalling his best ever for a whole match, which was against Romania in 2011 \u2013 and after the break hit Jordan Larmour so hard that the Twickenham groundsman will be picking bits of the Ireland wing off the turf for the next few weeks. Soon after he tracked Jacob Stockdale down the left and bundled him into touch. He was also in the thick of things for Joe Cokanasiga\u2019s second try, running a perfect decoy line after Ford and Farrell had combined. He does not even have to touch the ball to leave his imprint. Ben Youngs knows Tuilagi better than most, having come through the Leicester academy with him. On Friday he said he had never seen Tuilagi in better physical shape but perhaps more significantly, spoke of what a good place he was in mentally and perhaps the best thing that can be said about Tuilagi is that it is no longer necessary to hold one\u2019s breath whenever he gets the ball and sets off towards a wall of defenders, as was the case not so long ago. We often hear about how popular Tuilagi is off the pitch, how he rules the pool table and makes everyone coffee and seeing him in this kind of form is sure to rub off on his team-mates. \u201cHe\u2019s in a good place, he\u2019s got a smile on his face, he\u2019s getting fitter,\u201d said Jones. \u201cHe\u2019s about 80 per cent fit, when he gets there he will be a handful. One of his best assets is that people like to play with him.\u201d Throughout his tenure, Jones has never liked answering questions about players absent from his squad. The mere utterance of Danny Cipriani has often been met with a quiet fury and more recently it has been Ben Te\u2019o off limits. Over the years he has always had time to talk about Tuilagi, however. Now we know why.",

I moved coach to be with Steve Fudge. I have a new psychologist and he has been helping me so much. There has been a bit of stigma about psychology, maybe connotations that it makes you weak. But I think it\u2019s what makes me stronger over everybody else.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile Hughes, who had talked beforehand about breaking Linford Christie\u2019s British 100m record, was disgusted with his performance. \u201cIt was a terrible race, I\u2019m not happy with that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I made the team, I\u2019m in the top three. I still have some time leading up to Doha and I\u2019ll use that time to get sharper and come back again.\u201d</p> <p>Hughes, you imagine, will be the British male sprinter on people\u2019s lips come the worlds.

I can\u2019t believe it.\u201d Edoburun also revealed he had been close to breaking point after missing out on the 2017 world championships in London. \u201cI came fourth at the trials and didn\u2019t get picked for the relay,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was the biggest heartbreak I have had in my whole career. It was my home champs. I literally live 20 minutes from the track and I wasn\u2019t even part of it. That forced me to ask myself a question. I have had so much junior success, won medals, run quick times and that was my first big failure. \u201cI said to myself: \u2018Have I got what it takes? I need to make changes. I moved coach to be with Steve Fudge. I have a new psychologist and he has been helping me so much. There has been a bit of stigma about psychology, maybe connotations that it makes you weak. But I think it\u2019s what makes me stronger over everybody else.\u201d Meanwhile Hughes, who had talked beforehand about breaking Linford Christie\u2019s British 100m record, was disgusted with his performance. \u201cIt was a terrible race, I\u2019m not happy with that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I made the team, I\u2019m in the top three. I still have some time leading up to Doha and I\u2019ll use that time to get sharper and come back again.\u201d Hughes, you imagine, will be the British male sprinter on people\u2019s lips come the worlds. But this, emphatically and gloriously, was Edoburun\u2019s day.",

Follow the action here with Barry Glendenning\u2019s live minute-by-minute report:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2019/aug/24/norwich-city-v-chelsea-premier-league-live\">Norwich City v Chelsea: Premier League \u2013 live!</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d5fd82a8f084061ab38b46d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-24T12:11:09.147Z\">1.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Welcome!</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Manchester United</strong> have the opportunity to go top of the table \u2013 for a few hours at least before the 5.30pm BST Anfield showdown between Liverpool and Arsenal \u2013 when they host <strong>Crystal Palace</strong>.</p> <p>Palace took four points from their two visits to Manchester last season, Andros Townsend\u2019s volley from the gods securing a shock 3-2 win at City while there was a rather less memorable 0-0 draw at United. Speaking of the latter, Palace are pleasing fans of binary sequences but not their own supporters after scorelines of 0-0 and 0-1 so far, their lack of goals a familiar problem.</p> <p>The Wan-Bissaka derby is one of four 3pm kick-offs in the Premier League \u2026</p> <p>It\u2019s <strong>Brighton</strong> v <strong>Southampton</strong> down on the south coast. Graham Potter\u2019s reign at the Amex has already got off to a flying start with four points out of six but Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s stock is down after a pair of back-to-back defeats. Brighton have won just one of their last 10 meetings with Southampton so Saints hold the historical edge.</p> <p>Like Brighton, <strong>Sheffield United </strong>have also collected four points from their opening two fixtures. They continue their bid to sneak into mid-table while no-one is looking with a home game against top six wannabes <strong>Leicester</strong>. Brendan Rodgers\u2019s side drew 0-0 at home to Wolves and looked menacing in a 1-1 draw at Chelsea last time. They need to up the goal count though and boyhood Sheffield Wednesday fan Jamie Vardy would be particularly happy to open his account for the season against the Blades.</p> <p><strong>Watford</strong> v <strong>West Ham</strong> completes the 3pm Premier League offering. The alphabet put both in the relegation zone of the pre-season table but Watford have decided to stay there after back-to-back defeats. West Ham have a point but were thrashed 5-0 by Manchester City on opening day. Good luck predicting this one. Both sides\u2019 form can oscillate wildly and, for no good reason, West Ham won 4-1 at Vicarage Road last season.</p> <p>On the subject of teams in claret and blue, <strong>Aston Villa</strong> banked their first points of the season with a 2-0 home win over <strong>Everton</strong> in the Friday night game.</p> <p>In the Championship, it\u2019s good news if you play in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmnoaR8Rvb8\">white shirt</a> (the Charlatans\u2019 most underrated song?). <strong>Leeds</strong>, <strong>Swansea</strong> and <strong>Fulham </strong>occupy the top three places and, while wickets tumble at Headingley, Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s West Yorkshire outfit hope to skittle rock-bottom <strong>Stoke</strong>. Fulham host <strong>Nottingham Forest</strong> but Swansea can put their legs up for the afternoon ahead of their home clash with <strong>Birmingham </strong>on Sunday.</p> <p><strong>Blackpool</strong> lead the way in League One and the Seasiders make the short trip to mid-table <strong>Rochdale</strong>. Speaking of the north-west, <strong>Crewe</strong> top League Two and bid to stay there with three points from their trip to <strong>Newport</strong>.</p> <p>In Scotland, <strong>Celtic </strong>and <strong>Rangers </strong>have maximum points and 20 goals between them. Yes, after just two matches apiece! Both play on Sunday but we\u2019ll have updates from the other four Scottish Premiership games, including third-placed <strong>Ross County</strong> at home to <strong>Livingston</strong>.</p> <p>And don\u2019t forget Europe too. <strong>Borussia Dortmund</strong> moved three points clear at the top of the Bundesliga with a 3-1 win at <strong>Cologne</strong> on Friday night while <strong>Bayern Munich</strong>, who failed to win their opener, are away to <strong>Schalke</strong> in a 5.30pm BST kick-off.</p> <p>And let\u2019s all cheer on <strong>Union Berlin</strong>, who got a rather rude awakening on their Bundesliga bow last Saturday when being tonked 4-0 at home by Leipzig. They hope for better fortunes away to Augsburg in one of five 2.30pm BST fixtures in the German top flight.

      "bodyText": "And that\u2019s it for this particular live blog. While top two Liverpool and Arsenal battle it out at Anfield (still 0-0), Leicester now sit third in the Premier League table after scoring a 2-1 win at previously unbeaten Sheffield United. But the afternoon\u2019s most eye-popping result undoubtedly came at Old Trafford where another missed penalty from a Manchester United player (Marcus Rashford this time) allowed Crystal Palace to grab a late and memorable 2-1 win. Completing the theme of away victories were West Ham (3-1 at Watford) and Southampton (2-0 at 10-man Brighton). Chelsea had set the trend in the early kick-off with a 3-2 success at Norwich. In the Championship, Leeds march on at the top after a 3-0 win at Stoke, Ipswich head League One after bashing Bolton 5-0 while Exeter lead the way in League Two after a 3-2 success at Morecambe. Livingston are top of the pops in Scotland. Bundesliga update. Freiburg and Leverkusen joined Borussia Dortmund (winners last night) as the only sides with 100% records in the German top flight. Both scored 3-1 away wins at Paderborn and Fortuna Dusseldorf respectively. Bayern are currently drawing 0-0 at Schalke in the 5.30pm BST game. Full-time: Brighton 0-2 Southampton Moussa Djenepo stole the headlines as Saints saw off 10-man Brighton. Here\u2019s the report: More from Scotland. A great day for Livingston as they went top of the SPL with a thumping win at Ross County. Celtic and Rangers play tomorrow. Hamilton 1-3 Motherwell Hibernian 2-2 St Johnstone Kilmarnock 0-0 Aberdeen Ross County 1-4 Livingston Scotland: Some nice detail here from Simon McMahon: \u201cA great day for Cowdenbeath fans everywhere as they beat Annan in Scottish League Two, and see Dundee United do the same to Dunfermline in the Scottish Championship courtesy of a Lawrence Shankland double, who now has 7 goals in his first 3 league appearances for United (and a missed penalty).\u201d Live from Anfield. Approaching kick-off time on Merseyside. Liverpool and Arsenal sit first and second in the table. Will it end that way? Barry Glendenning will guide you through it all with his minute-by-minute report. League Two results: Cambridge 1-2 Oldham Carlisle 2-2 Salford Cheltenham 2-2 Swindon Colchester 1-0 Northampton Grimsby 5-2 Port Vale Leyton Orient 2-3 Crawley Macclesfield 1-0 Scunthorpe Mansfield 0-0 Stevenage Morecambe 2-3 Exeter Newport 1-0 Crewe Plymouth 3-0 Walsall Full-time: Watford 1-3 West Ham Haller stuns hosts. Nope, not the German fella who opened the scoring in the 1966 World Cup final. This was Frenchman Sebastien Haller, whose first goals in English football won the day for West Ham. Nick Ames was at Vicarage Road. Full-time: Manchester United 1-2 Crystal Palace Jamie Jackson reports on a dramatic afternoon at Old Trafford. Palace\u2019s first league win at Old Trafford since 1989, the same year that Arsenal pinched the title at Anfield. Omens, omens. League One results: Ipswich hit five at Bolton while Peterborough and Wycombe are also in the goals. Doncaster 2-1 Lincoln Bolton 0-5 Ipswich Bristol Rovers 3-1 Oxford Coventry 1-0 Gillingham Fleetwood 2-0 Accrington MK Dons 0-4 Peterborough Rochdale 0-0 Blackpool Shrewsbury 0-0 Burton Sunderland 3-1 Wimbledon Wycombe 4-3 Southend Doncaster 2-1 Lincoln Championship results: Leeds stay top with easy win at Stoke while Charlton are up to second. Barnsley 1-3 Luton Blackburn 0-0 Cardiff Charlton 1-0 Brentford Fulham 1-2 Nottingham Forest Huddersfield 0-2 Reading Hull 1-3 Bristol City Middlesbrough 1-1 Millwall Preston 2-1 Sheffield Wednesday QPR 3-1 Wigan Stoke 0-3 Leeds Derby 1-1 West Brom Full-time: Sheffield United 1-2 Leicester Paul Doyle was at Bramall Lane to see Leicester bank their first win of the season. Liverpool v Arsenal Liverpool: Adrian, Alexander-Arnold, van Dijk, Matip, Robertson, Henderson, Fabinho, Wijnaldum, Salah, Firmino, Mane. Subs: Milner, Gomez, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Lallana, Shaqiri, Origi, Kelleher. Arsenal: Leno, Maitland-Niles, Luiz, Papastathopoulos, Monreal, Guendouzi, Xhaka, Willock, Pepe, Aubameyang, Ceballos. Subs: Mkhitaryan, Lacazette, Torreira, Chambers, Nelson, Martinez, Kolasinac. Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire) Full-times in the Premier League. And it\u2019s a full house of away wins if we add in the Carrow Road result. Palace won 3-2 at Manchester City last season and now they have a first league win at Old Trafford since 1989. Norwich 2-3 Chelsea Brighton 0-2 Southampton Manchester United 1-2 Crystal Palace Sheffield United 1-2 Leicester Watford 1-3 West Ham. Does this bode well for Arsenal ahead of their clash with Liverpool?! Team news coming up on that very shortly. Dramatic twist at Old Trafford. We\u2019re all awaiting a late winner from United but Palace have different ideas. Zaha dribbles into the box, loses possession and van Aanholt, who had driven upfield, is there to collect the loose ball and rifle a shot past de Gea which the United goalkeeper will feel he should have saved down at his near post. Amazing! Scenes at Old Trafford! James levels late. United\u2019s equaliser starts with Zaha trying to dribble downfield but being caught by Pogba. United work it nicely through Martial and Rashford and James curls an excellent goal into the top corner from just inside the box. All over on the south coast as Nathan Redmond makes it 2-0. They\u2019re level and it\u2019s Daniel James with his second in two starts at Old Trafford. In the Championship: Hope for Fulham as Aleksandar Mitrovic chops Forest\u2019s lead in half with seven minutes to play. 1-2. At Old Trafford: Five minutes still to play as the second half got under way a little late but Man Utd are running out of ideas. Palace look set for another memorable away day in Manchester. Five for Grimsby. Not a familiar soundbite. James Hanson makes it 5-2 for the Mariners at home to Port Vale. In the Championship: And further news in that division as Bristol City and QPR both take 3-1 leads against Hull and Wigan respectively. Championship report. Earlier, West Brom scored a late equaliser to draw 1-1 at Derby. Ben Fisher was at Pride Park. Hat-trick! It\u2019s not going well for Harry Maguire (Man Utd 0-1 Palace) but it certainly is for Chris Maguire. The Sunderland man has a hat-trick as the Black Cats lead AFC Wimbledon 3-1. Old Trafford analysis. Kieran Hegarty describes the match, thus: \u201cManu playing on the front foot again.. but coming second in all the bitey (!) moments.. again. Won\u2019t end well I tell ya.\u201d Quiz latest. Another name thrown into the mix by Adam Anderson. \u201cI seem to remember Fabrizio Ravanelli for Middlesbrough getting off to a flyer and then fading towards the end of the season.\u201d In the Championship: Talking of away teams doing well, Leeds are 3-0 up at Stoke while Nottingham Forest are 2-0 up at Fulham. All four away teams winning in the Premier League. Well, fancy that. Brighton 0-1 Southampton Manchester United 0-1 Crystal Palace Sheffield United 1-2 Leicester Watford 1-3 West Ham A second from Haller. And this one\u2019s an overhead kick! Wow! West Ham won this same fixture 4-1 last season and they\u2019re closing in on the same scoreline. Rashford misses! The striker hits the post. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer now checking who is United\u2019s third-choice penalty-taker as he\u2019s going to get a promotion. Penalty for Man Utd. Rashford grabs the ball as Pogba steps away! Big-money signing Haller gets his first for West Ham. It\u2019s perhaps the easiest he\u2019ll ever score as he taps in Felipe Anderson\u2019s pass. What a goal from Harvey Barnes. Just his second for the Foxes. The visitors are back in front. A screamer from Moussa Djenepo. Ings plays a pass out to the summer signing, who takes a touch and curls a beauty from 20 yards. What an introduction from the substitute. A more conventional goal from Sheffield United\u2019s Oli McBurnie as he rises highest in the box and guides a clever header past Schmeichel. Nice cross from George Baldock. And an equaliser for the Blades! Deadlock broken on the south coast. The real quiz. Patrick Baker puts forward Diego Costa. \u201cStarted on fire for Chelsea. Alas, a flame too hot to be sustained in English football.\u201d Jack Brown adds: \u201cKlinsmann scored vs Sheff Wed, then Everton...did he score in his third??\u201d Nope, they lost 1-0 at home to Man Utd. In Scotland. Livingston are going top of the SPL in style. Jack Stobbs gives them a 4-1 lead at Ross County. In the Championship: Leeds double their lead at Stoke as Patrick Bamford sets up Ezgjan Alioski to make it 2-0. Union Berlin off the mark. Yes! An equaliser. Their first ever goal in the Bundesliga is netted by Sebastian Andersson with 10 minutes left. Augsburg 1-1 Union Berlin. Peep! Second 45s now in play. Can Crystal Palace hold out? Quiz latest. Tom Chivers puts forward Jose Reyes. \u201cHe seemed to score in all his first few games,\u201d says Toms. \u201cA vital FPL pick early in that season, must have been about 2006. Also: Salah? I haven\u2019t checked these because that would be cheating.\u201d Admirably honest. And, you\u2019re right. Reyes scored in each of his first six games for Arsenal, the first of those in the Community Shield. Scottish Prem half-times: Hamilton 1-2 Motherwell Hibernian 1-0 Johnstone Kilmarnock 0-0 Aberdeen Ross County 1-3 Livingston Livingston all set to go top of the table. Screengrab that Livi fans.

Weird fact: Liverpool\u2019s Ben Woodburn scored his first league goal today. For Oxford. They\u2019re losing though.

Half-time whistles blowing. Something to keep you going in the break from our earlier post about Teemu Pukki... Peter McDonnell writes:\u201dPLEASE give us the other eight players who scored in their first three Premier League appearances!!! Can\u2019t find it anywhere! Myself and some friends are tentatively suggesting Van Nistlerooy, Michu, Torres, Su\u00e1rez.... But haven\u2019t a clue really.\u201d Anyone? There are 10 and so far we have Pukki and Pavel Pogrebnyak. News from Scotland. Simon McMahon gives us this update: \u201cAfternoon Dave. In Dunfermline watching Dundee United as they try to maintain their 100% start to the Scottish Championship. They lead the Fifers (I\u2019ll not tell you what my Cowdenbeath supporting brother in law calls them) 1-0, an early Lawrence Shankland goal the difference, his sixth in the league this season, only three games in. Elsewhere, Arbroath lead Alloa and Dundee are being held by Inverness.\u201d Big goal in the Championship: Table-toppers Leeds hit the front at struggling Stoke as Stuart Dallas fires home. 1-0 to the visitors. Tactical observation. Michael Jake Shaffer is watching the action at Old Trafford and notes: \u201cWhile Palace look like they have a plan whether they are in or out of possession, United look as if the only thing written on their tactics board was \u201cWin Game.\u201d\u201d VAR says no goal. Brighton have the ball in the Southampton net via Lewis Dunk\u2019s header but it\u2019s ruled out for offside. Goal for Sheffield Wednesday fan Jamie Vardy. It had been coming. After a series of shots from outside the box, Leicester go in front as James Maddison sets up Vardy with a lovely pass with the outside of his foot which the striker rams home with his left foot. Emphatic finish. Luke Shaw taken off at Old Trafford. The left-back is carrying a knock and is replaced by Ashley Young. Hat-trick of goals for the Hatters. Barnsley are unbeaten in 29 homes games but Luton are tearing them apart. 3-0 to the visitors, the latest from Harry Cornick. A shock on the cards at Old Trafford. Palace haven\u2019t been it as an attacking force but Ayew finds acres of space through the middle and puts de Gea on his backside with a cool finish into the corner. Red card: Brighton are down to 10 men against Southampton after a horror challenge by Florin Andone. You\u2019ll wince at this. Mike Brooks pulls me up on a stat. \u201cAt Old Trafford. Manchester United dominating the early possession against Crystal Palace, who haven\u2019t won there since 1989.\u201d Manchester United 1 - 2 Crystal Palace (30.11.11 Old Trafford). You\u2019re right, Mike. Should have said \u201cin the League!\u201d Premier League latest halfway through the first 45: Brighton 0-0 Southampton Man Utd 0-0 Crystal Palace Sheffield United 0-0 Leicester Watford 1-1 West Ham At Bramall Lane. Not an awful lot happening but Leicester, who started slowly at Chelsea last week, are starting to find some rhythm. In the Championship. Four goals so far in the 3pm games and half of those have been scored by Luton, who lead 2-0 at Barnsley. Forest and Wigan still lead 1-0. Great finish from Gray. Will Hughes feeds a nice ball into the West Ham box and Gray gets in behind and fires an angled shot into the bottom corner. 1-1. Another goal was coming and it goes to the hosts thanks to Andre Gray. It\u2019s their first of the season. With Celtic and Rangers not playing today, Ross County could have gone top of the SPL table with a home win over Livingston. However, it\u2019s the visitors who look all set to claim that honour after taking an early 2-0 lead. March Rashford can\u2019t convert. The Man Utd striker, who already has two goals this season, looks to be in the clear but can\u2019t get a proper shot away. Palace holding out for now. At Vicarage Road. It\u2019s wide open. Watford\u2019s Gerard Deulofeu goes close to a leveller before Lanzini shoots wide at the other end. Still 1-0 to West Ham. In League One. Chris Maguire gives hosts Sunderland a 1-0 lead over AFC Wimbledon after poor defending. Manchester United go close at home to Crystal Palace. Scott McTominay meets a corner with his bonce but heads over. Early goals in the Championship. Cedric Kipre (2) puts Wigan ahead at QPR while Lewis Grabban (4) gives Nottingham Forest a 1-0 lead at Fulham. At Old Trafford. Manchester United dominating the early possession against Crystal Palace, who haven\u2019t won there since 1989. With his first touch of the season, fit-again Mark Noble strokes home the penalty and what a start for West Ham. Penalty at Vicarage Road. Lanzini goes down in the box under challenge from Abdoulaye Doucour\u00e9 and West Ham have a spot-kick against Watford. VAR had a look and computer says Yes. Peep! Off we go in the 3pm kick-offs. That\u2019s BST. Midnight in Sydney (see Sheffield United infographic below). Another goal from a Chelsea player. Although this one comes from on-loan Lewis Baker who puts through his own net to gift Bayer Leverkusen a sixth-minute lead at Fortuna Dusseldorf. Mainz and Paderborn also leading in Germany. In a game of two penalties it finished all-square at Pride Park in the early Championship kick-off. Derby 1-1 West Brom. Kenneth Zohore\u2019s 84th-minute spot-kick wiped out Martyn Waghorn\u2019s sixth-minute conversion to give the Baggies a point. Will VAR make more headlines today? Max Rushden made the trip to Stockley Park to find out more. The world clock through the prism of Sheffield United\u2019s twitter page. Full-time at Carrow Road. Chelsea have won by the odd goal in five, sparing Frank Lampard from being the first Blues manager since Bobby Campbell in 1988 to fail to win any of his first four games in charge of the club. Full details on the game in Barry Glendenning\u2019s minute-by-minute report. This is a sash. A bit thick in this picture but who doesn\u2019t like a shot of the 1970 World Cup? Crystal Palace are wearing their third kit for the first time apparently. Can\u2019t help but think the clean lines of that sash have been badly compromised. Whatever happened to Pavel Pogrebnyak, eh? Some effort if you can get the other eight. Fun fact: Teemu Pukki, on target again for Norwich today, has outscored seven of the eight teams kicking off at 3pm. His five-goal tally matches Manchester United\u2019s. Watford v West Ham Watford: Foster, Femenia, Dawson, Cathcart, Holebas, Doucoure, Capoue, Hughes, Cleverley, Deulofeu, Gray. Subs: Gomes, Janmaat, Welbeck, Chalobah, Quina, Sarr, Kabasele.

Referee: Paul Tierney (Lancashire) Team news coming shortly. In the meantime, Tammy Abraham has scored his second of the afternoon to put Chelsea 3-2 up at Norwich. Half-time from The Championship. Derby lead West Brom 1-0 via Martyn Waghorn\u2019s sixth-minute penalty. Always an appropriate scorer for the Rams. We all like a Matchday Playlist to get us in the mood. Plenty of belters on here but where are The Specials? Coventry\u2019s finest, no? Let\u2019s do this. It\u2019s a little while yet until those clocks hit 3pm but, in the meantime, there\u2019s a humdinger of a game going on at Carrow Road. Given that both teams can\u2019t defend, you won\u2019t be surprised to learn that Norwich and Chelsea shared four goals in the opening 45 minutes. Follow the action here with Barry Glendenning\u2019s live minute-by-minute report: Manchester United have the opportunity to go top of the table \u2013 for a few hours at least before the 5.30pm BST Anfield showdown between Liverpool and Arsenal \u2013 when they host Crystal Palace. Palace took four points from their two visits to Manchester last season, Andros Townsend\u2019s volley from the gods securing a shock 3-2 win at City while there was a rather less memorable 0-0 draw at United. Speaking of the latter, Palace are pleasing fans of binary sequences but not their own supporters after scorelines of 0-0 and 0-1 so far, their lack of goals a familiar problem. The Wan-Bissaka derby is one of four 3pm kick-offs in the Premier League \u2026 It\u2019s Brighton v Southampton down on the south coast. Graham Potter\u2019s reign at the Amex has already got off to a flying start with four points out of six but Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s stock is down after a pair of back-to-back defeats. Brighton have won just one of their last 10 meetings with Southampton so Saints hold the historical edge. Like Brighton, Sheffield United have also collected four points from their opening two fixtures. They continue their bid to sneak into mid-table while no-one is looking with a home game against top six wannabes Leicester. Brendan Rodgers\u2019s side drew 0-0 at home to Wolves and looked menacing in a 1-1 draw at Chelsea last time. They need to up the goal count though and boyhood Sheffield Wednesday fan Jamie Vardy would be particularly happy to open his account for the season against the Blades. Watford v West Ham completes the 3pm Premier League offering. The alphabet put both in the relegation zone of the pre-season table but Watford have decided to stay there after back-to-back defeats. West Ham have a point but were thrashed 5-0 by Manchester City on opening day. Good luck predicting this one. Both sides\u2019 form can oscillate wildly and, for no good reason, West Ham won 4-1 at Vicarage Road last season. On the subject of teams in claret and blue, Aston Villa banked their first points of the season with a 2-0 home win over Everton in the Friday night game. In the Championship, it\u2019s good news if you play in a white shirt (the Charlatans\u2019 most underrated song?). Leeds, Swansea and Fulham occupy the top three places and, while wickets tumble at Headingley, Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s West Yorkshire outfit hope to skittle rock-bottom Stoke. Fulham host Nottingham Forest but Swansea can put their legs up for the afternoon ahead of their home clash with Birmingham on Sunday. Blackpool lead the way in League One and the Seasiders make the short trip to mid-table Rochdale. Speaking of the north-west, Crewe top League Two and bid to stay there with three points from their trip to Newport. In Scotland, Celtic and Rangers have maximum points and 20 goals between them. Yes, after just two matches apiece! Both play on Sunday but we\u2019ll have updates from the other four Scottish Premiership games, including third-placed Ross County at home to Livingston. And don\u2019t forget Europe too. Borussia Dortmund moved three points clear at the top of the Bundesliga with a 3-1 win at Cologne on Friday night while Bayern Munich, who failed to win their opener, are away to Schalke in a 5.30pm BST kick-off. And let\u2019s all cheer on Union Berlin, who got a rather rude awakening on their Bundesliga bow last Saturday when being tonked 4-0 at home by Leipzig. They hope for better fortunes away to Augsburg in one of five 2.30pm BST fixtures in the German top flight. Nick Ames told Union Berlin\u2019s story last week.",

      "body": "<p><a href=\"http://www.etgarkeret.com/\" title=\"\">Etgar Keret</a> is one of Israel\u2019s leading writers, known best for his short stories, graphic novels and screenplays; in 2016, he also published an acclaimed memoir, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/19/etgar-keret-seven-good-years-review-essay-collection-israeli-life\" title=\"\">The Seven Good Years</a></em>. His new collection, <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/fly-already-9781783780495.html\" title=\"\">Fly Already</a></em>, features a father who turns into a rabbit and an array of other surreal and apocalyptic scenarios. He lives in Tel Aviv with his wife and son.</p> <p><strong>Like your other books, </strong><em><strong>Fly Already</strong></em><strong> is a wild ride. Can you tell me a bit about what you\u2019re trying to do with short fiction?</strong><br>For the past 33 years, I\u2019ve been writing short stories, I would say, almost constantly. It\u2019s really more like an uncontrollable reflex, you know, than a career decision. It\u2019s my way of coping with reality.</p> <p>My stories come from a very unconscious place. I don\u2019t premeditate them, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen in them. Something about this transformation from writing short stories into a collection is almost like a therapy process in which I understand where I am at that time, what is bothering me, what is my experience.</p> <p><strong>What happened this time?</strong><br>I think it had to do with an accident I had about three years ago. I was in a car service going from Connecticut to Boston on a reading tour in the US, and the driver hit another car going something like 120km/h [75mph].

      "bodyText": "Etgar Keret is one of Israel\u2019s leading writers, known best for his short stories, graphic novels and screenplays; in 2016, he also published an acclaimed memoir, The Seven Good Years. His new collection, Fly Already, features a father who turns into a rabbit and an array of other surreal and apocalyptic scenarios. He lives in Tel Aviv with his wife and son. Like your other books, Fly Already is a wild ride. Can you tell me a bit about what you\u2019re trying to do with short fiction? For the past 33 years, I\u2019ve been writing short stories, I would say, almost constantly. It\u2019s really more like an uncontrollable reflex, you know, than a career decision. It\u2019s my way of coping with reality. My stories come from a very unconscious place. I don\u2019t premeditate them, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen in them. Something about this transformation from writing short stories into a collection is almost like a therapy process in which I understand where I am at that time, what is bothering me, what is my experience. What happened this time? I think it had to do with an accident I had about three years ago. I was in a car service going from Connecticut to Boston on a reading tour in the US, and the driver hit another car going something like 120km/h [75mph]. For the first couple of minutes I thought I was dying, and it was as if I was looking at myself from a distance, being very disappointed that my life was not [flashing] in front of my eyes, like they promised in the brochure. It wasn\u2019t Technicolor enough! I always saw it in American movies and it always had greater production value, a nicer musical score\u2026 I felt this overwhelming experience, like a candle that we know will go out in a second and everything will go dark; and at the same time this kind of understanding that on a global scale, you know, nothing happened. Those cars will keep driving by and the McDonald\u2019s will switch from breakfast to lunch at 11:30, and this idea of the title that came up to my mind was the Hebrew title of the collection, which is A Glitch at the Edge of the Galaxy. Many of the stories take place in a recognisable present day, but others are highly speculative and create a parallel reality. Why is that? I think the stories that I write about, say, cloning, or about AI, when I read them, I feel for sure that it\u2019s a fable\u2011like way to talk about racism and about xenophobia, and about the human instinct to try to find entities that have less rights than you and exploit them. You know, maybe in some ways, it\u2019s easier to write a story about a clone than to write a story about a refugee arriving in a European country. Politics run through your work. What do you feel about what\u2019s happening? The kind of crap that Johnson and Trump are doing now in the US and UK, Netanyahu\u2019s been doing for the past 20 years; I think he understood a long time ago that you don\u2019t have to control the country, you have to control the discourse. If in the past the role of the leader was of this kind of selfless person who puts the country in front of him, now it\u2019s the kind of guy that could win a Big Brother reality show. Everybody knows his name, a total asshole, but never boring; this is what you really demand from this guy, to be kind of visible and to be above the noise. Back to the stories, I notice a lot of strange, shape-shifting animals\u2026 Well, as I speak to you, my rabbit also listens. You really have a rabbit? Yes, I\u2019ll send you a photo of him!

It\u2019s funny because when I sit next to my computer and I write emails or surf, he never comes, but the moment I start writing a story he comes and sits next to my feet and doesn\u2019t get up until I finish it. What\u2019s the last really great book that you read? I\u2019m usually honest in my writing and less honest in interviews, but I can tell you that for the past year, I didn\u2019t read any book, which is the first time since I went to first grade. Why was that? My wife and I were working on a very demanding TV series, a project that demanded relocation and that we direct in French, when we don\u2019t speak French, so all in all it was a very overwhelming experience. It took a lot of my inner space. This year, I\u2019ve been doing something that \u2013 if we talk about changes in humanity \u2013 all humanity\u2019s been doing, but I guess I gave myself a very good alibi.

      "body": "<p>Ireland suffered burn-out in the warm-up. They faded in the heat as England scored a record number of points in the fixture and exceeded by two their previous highest winning margin. It was only 10 months ago that the Irish, having beaten New Zealand for the second time in two years, were being heralded as Europe\u2019s leading contenders in the World Cup, but now they cannot look beyond finishing at the top of a group that includes the hosts and Scotland.</p> <p>England were close to full strength for the first time this month and their formation showed the selection flux of the previous 18 months. There were only six starters from Ireland\u2019s previous visit here, at the end of the 2018 Six Nations, and none of the three backs who remained was starting in the same position, including Owen Farrell who that day had been redeployed at fly-half following two straight defeats.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/24/scotland-france-rugby-world-cup-warm-up-match-report\">Maitland and Harris edge Scotland to comeback victory over France</a> </p> </aside>  <p>England have been unfavourably compared to the 2003 World Cup winners but what other side in Japan will measure up to Martin Johnson\u2019s team? Even New Zealand have a whiff of vulnerability, a team that looks suspect in some positions and short of cover in others. There is no exemplar in a tournament that will be about seizing the moment and England, who can no longer be pigeon-holed tactically, look as equipped as anyone.</p> <p>They have Maro Itoje, a second row with the instinct of a New Zealand forward whose try four minutes into the second period, picking up on Ireland\u2019s 22 and stepping between two props before accelerating, showed how his game is evolving. He started by forcing a turnover and tracked the ball as if by radar, the centre of England\u2019s effort. And there was Manu Tuilagi, back at 13 whose threat is the same with or without the ball, a magnet for defenders.</p> <p>England led 22-10 at half-time. Their three tries came on the right wing with Tuilagi involved each time. The first, scored by Joe Cokanasiga from a scrum in Ireland\u2019s 22, was the result of Tuilagi being used as a decoy. He sucked in three tacklers to leave the home side\u2019s right wing unguarded which Elliot Daly exploited with a long pass.</p> <p>Jacob Stockdale had been drawn infield by Tuilagi, as the left wing was for the other two tries. It was Tuilagi\u2019s burst that set up the second with Daly this time the beneficiary after Itoje, Billy Vunipola and Kyle Sinckler had softened up a defence that in the opening period missed nearly one-quarter of its first-up tackles and was no more solid after the break. Tuilagi helped himself to the third as Stockdale again, with Conor Murray receiving treatment, planted himself in a defensive no-man\u2019s land.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"afb7120be15a4be49c6e3d6c531f6870f601e9fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/afb7120be15a4be49c6e3d6c531f6870f601e9fb/0_0_4338_2892/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maro Itoje celebrates with teammate Jamie George after scoring a try.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maro Itoje celebrates with teammate Jamie George after scoring a try.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Craig Mercer/MB Media/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Stockdale created Ireland\u2019s try which gave them the lead after eight minutes following Farrell\u2019s early penalty.

      "bodyText": "Ireland suffered burn-out in the warm-up. They faded in the heat as England scored a record number of points in the fixture and exceeded by two their previous highest winning margin. It was only 10 months ago that the Irish, having beaten New Zealand for the second time in two years, were being heralded as Europe\u2019s leading contenders in the World Cup, but now they cannot look beyond finishing at the top of a group that includes the hosts and Scotland. England were close to full strength for the first time this month and their formation showed the selection flux of the previous 18 months. There were only six starters from Ireland\u2019s previous visit here, at the end of the 2018 Six Nations, and none of the three backs who remained was starting in the same position, including Owen Farrell who that day had been redeployed at fly-half following two straight defeats. England have been unfavourably compared to the 2003 World Cup winners but what other side in Japan will measure up to Martin Johnson\u2019s team? Even New Zealand have a whiff of vulnerability, a team that looks suspect in some positions and short of cover in others. There is no exemplar in a tournament that will be about seizing the moment and England, who can no longer be pigeon-holed tactically, look as equipped as anyone. They have Maro Itoje, a second row with the instinct of a New Zealand forward whose try four minutes into the second period, picking up on Ireland\u2019s 22 and stepping between two props before accelerating, showed how his game is evolving. He started by forcing a turnover and tracked the ball as if by radar, the centre of England\u2019s effort. And there was Manu Tuilagi, back at 13 whose threat is the same with or without the ball, a magnet for defenders. England led 22-10 at half-time. Their three tries came on the right wing with Tuilagi involved each time. The first, scored by Joe Cokanasiga from a scrum in Ireland\u2019s 22, was the result of Tuilagi being used as a decoy. He sucked in three tacklers to leave the home side\u2019s right wing unguarded which Elliot Daly exploited with a long pass. Jacob Stockdale had been drawn infield by Tuilagi, as the left wing was for the other two tries. It was Tuilagi\u2019s burst that set up the second with Daly this time the beneficiary after Itoje, Billy Vunipola and Kyle Sinckler had softened up a defence that in the opening period missed nearly one-quarter of its first-up tackles and was no more solid after the break. Tuilagi helped himself to the third as Stockdale again, with Conor Murray receiving treatment, planted himself in a defensive no-man\u2019s land. Stockdale created Ireland\u2019s try which gave them the lead after eight minutes following Farrell\u2019s early penalty. The wing\u2019s kick to the line bounced awkwardly for Tuilagi and Jordan Larmour followed up to score, but under pressure up front and unusually wasteful in the line-out, Ireland buckled as England were both unrelentingly physical and adept at creating space. Dishevelled was the word their head coach Joe Schmidt reached for. England have replicated the likely heat in Japan in training and here, with the temperature in the 80s, they were able to play at a sustained pace. The decision to resuscitate the midfield axis of George Ford and Farrell gave England the breath of continuity, complementing the two open-side flankers in the back row, Tom Curry and Sam Underhill, who combined for England\u2019s sixth try on 56 minutes that underlined the difference between the sides. Ireland are most comfortable dictating the pace of a game by dominating possession. They were without the injured Jonathan Sexton and Murray sat out the second half but no part of their game functioned smoothly.

Tuilagi was again used as a midfield decoy, creating space for Cokanasiga who came off the right wing into midfield from a lineout and was found by Farrell.

      "bodyText": "With that, I think it is time to wrap up our Challenge Cup final coverage. Thanks for following it with me and congratulations to Warrington. And here is Aaron\u2019s report: Aaron Bower\u2019s report will be with you shortly in the meantime here are the Warrington players enjoying themselves on the Wembley pitch: What an upset! Warrington have done everything right this afternoon and it has all gone wrong for St Helens. You cannot make this many mistakes and win a final. 78 mins: Grace looks like he might score but who is there to force the ball out of his hands? Clark, of course. The hooker leaps up and celebrates like he has just scored, what an effort. 77 mins: Daryl Clark named man of the match, it has been an incredible display from the hooker. 76 mins: It is desperate stuff from Saints now, their latest forray ends with the ball literally chucked out of play. Minutes left for Wire to hang on now. 72 mins: They do put it away! It is Daryl Clark who gets the try. He fakes out Paulo and burstw through Walmsley from five metres out, great individual effort. Patton knocks over the extras. Sure this over. 71 mins: This time it is Fages! The Frenchman coughs up a knock inside the Saints\u2019 10. Warrington could put it away here! 69 mins: Both sides are tiring now as they swap sets. Another handling error from Saints. Coote, who has had a poor game, coughs it up on halfway. More good news for Wire. 66 mins: Another turnover from Saints as they look to press upfield. The errors are adding up and the clock is working against St Helens as they bid to turn this around. 61 mins: Saints are pouncing on any opportunities to pin Wire back in their half, but kicking into the sun at Wembley is proving a fruitful way for Warrington to clear their lines. 57 mins: A great little step from Theo Fages causes a miss in the Wire defence. Coote cannot convert though, that could be costly! 56 mins: More pressure from Saints and now they get a chance from close range after a loose Warrington kick. 53 mins: Great interplay between Roby and Coote breaks down just a few metres out from the Warrington line. Saints follow that up with a great defensive set, but the Warrington kick is a good. St Helens are forced to start from deep and make little ground. 51 mins: Almost a huge error from Grace as he chases a Warrington kick on his own line. The wing knocks on and Warrington will go again from a Saints goal line drop out. 48 mins: Great tackle from Fages! Currie looks set to run the length of the pitch after a Saints attack breaks down inside the Warrington 10. The Frenchman hounds him down and hauls the Warrington man to the turf. That could well have been a try-saver. 46 mins: After the Saints penalty, Fages\u2019 high kick is knocked on by a Warrington player and his side have six more on the Wolves\u2019 line. Makinson thinks he has scored in the corner but replays show he lost control of the ball as he reaches out to touch down. Great game this. 44 mins: Warrington almost have a third but are denied as Hicks sends Lineham\u2019s close range score up to the video referee, an infringing touch on Goodwin as the wing dives over sees try ruled out. More controversy. 43 mins: Goodwin immediately gains 30 metres. Saints see it out but cough it up inside their own half. Exactly the start the Wire would have wanted. 41 mins: Warrington to bring it out. The teams are back out. Can Saints turn it around in the second half? The restart to come shortly. An update from Aaron at Wembley: Well, who saw this coming? Not only have Warrington handled everything St Helens have thrown at them commendably, but they have also timed their moments in attack to perfection, too. Their 12-point lead at half-time is thoroughly deserved and having succumbed last year as the overwhelming favourites, Warrington are doing to Catalans what the Dragons did to them 12 months ago. The big worry for Saints is not the scoreline at present - there is still plenty of time left in that regard - but the fact that this is not the kind of weather to be playing catch-up in. If Warrington score first after half-time, they then have a huge mountain to climb. Incredible effort from Warrington as they go in with a two-try lead. The Wire have defended like a port in a storm, it has looked rough at times but they have stood firm when it mattered. 40 mins: A soft Warrington penalty in their own 10 gives Saints big chance to get one back before the break but Warrington hold firm to see off the set. Daryl Clark makes a huge tackle to stop as Wire survive. 38 mins: Saints now struggling to make inroads. Their latest set ends just inside the Warrington half but Ratchford\u2019s poor fizzing kick to corner means Saints start their return in decent position. 34 mins: Ben Murdoch-Masila makes Saints pay! The big forward forces his way over after Jack Hughes\u2019 short pass out to the right. Ratchford again is reliable with the boot. 32 mins: Huge error from Coote! Under no pressure from a Ratchford high kick, on his own line the full-back shells the catch. Warrington with another big chance. 30 mins: Saints get a penalty but squander the opening with a forward pass. Th favourites look a little rattled by that Philbin score. 28 mins: The game\u2019s second penalty again gives Warrington a chance of a full set in good starting position. This time Murdoch-Masila is held up and possession changes hands. 26 mins: Grace is ruled to played loose ball and give Warrington a new set in good field position. Clark makes break and off loads to the replacement Joe Philbin who eventually bowls over the line after picking a great line. Ratchford adds the extras and Wire take a shock lead, game on! 25 mins: No try as Mark Percival touches down for Saints but Robert Hicks takes this one to the video referee and with a knock on in the build what looks like a first score of the game is ruled out. Warrington breathe again. 21 mins: A strong defensive set from Warrington means Saints must start their latest attack from deep in their own half. With a third of the pitch bathed in sunshine it is bound to be hot on the playing surface, you feel fatigue could be a big factor as this goes on. Warrington are working hard but it is Saints who are constantly probing in attack. 19 mins: Wasted chance for the Wire on the first set with the ball ultimately ushered over the dead ball line by Saints. Second time around Jason Clark knocks on 35 metres out, ending the danger. 17 mins: Saints have looked less secure defending on their left flank, Ratchford sends up a kick and there\u2019s a knock on from a player in white. Real chance for Warrington score with a full set inside the Saints\u2019 10 metre line. 15 mins: Almost immediately Saints go up the other end after a big break Kevin Naigama, Grace has a chance of a score on the left but is just held up. 13 mins: Daryl Clark breaks a tackle and stays on his feet to see Warrington make good ground in the Saints half. Ratchford\u2019s kick is not cleanly taken Regan Grace but there is a knock on from Wire, let off. 10 mins: Makinson makes a great take virtually on his own line and gets the Saints set off to a strong start, making 30 metres. The attack ends in Warrington penalty but Saints are making good ground with virtually every set at the moment. Still all square though. 7 mins: St Helens certainly living up to their billing in the opening stages here but so far Warrington have been stout in defence. A shock knock-on from Walmsley ends Saints\u2019 latest attack. 3 mins: Saints think they have an early score as Tommy Makinson breaks a tackle off the right wing before Theo Fages dinks under the posts but referee Robert Hicks does not bother to send it up for a check as Morgan Knowles reaches it and think he has touched down. Replays suggest it was a try. 2 mins: Saints rumble down field and Coote hoists a kick that immediately has Ratchford at full-back under pressure but he takes it well and Warrington work it clear. 1 min: Stafan Ratchford kicks us off. A bit of pre-match patter from Aaron Bower at Wembley: The build-up has been almost entirely dominated by the fitness of Blake Austin, but in truth, the focus here should be on this St Helens side. If they execute their game-plan like they have done on a near-weekly basis in Super League this season, you suspect it will be irrelevant whether Austin is out there or not come full-time. This is all about the Saints. If they can handle the pressure of being overwhelming favourites, they should win the game. A fast start will be key for Warrington if they are to stand a chance; too many times this year have the Saints been well ahead by the end of the opening quarter. If that happens today, it could be a long afternoon for the Wire. Before Abide With Me, Wembley pays its respects to young Batley Bulldogs half-back Archie Bruce with a minute\u2019s applause. With the traditional pre-match anthem done, the players make their way on to the Wembley pitch. Kick-off is imminent. Just over ten minutes to go until kick-off. Here is a little pre-match reading. Aaron Bower is Wembley today. Here are his thoughts on Warrington\u2019s starting line-up. Here are today\u2019s starting line-ups. Warrington Wolves: Stefan Ratchford, Tom Lineham, Bryson Goodwin, Tony King, Josh Charnley, Ben Currie, Declan Patton, Chris Hill, Daryl Clark, Mike Cooper, Ben Murdoch-Masila, Jack Hughes, Jason Clark. Bench: Sitaleki Akauola, Joe Philbin, Matt Davis, Jake Mamo. St Helens: Lachlan Coote, Tommy Makinson, Kevin Naiqama, Mark Percival, Regan Grace, Jonny Lomax, Theo Fages, Alex Walmsley, James Roby, Luke Thompson, Zeb Taia, Dominique Peyroux, Morgan Knowles. Bench: Joseph Paulo, Louie McCarthy-Scarsbrook, Kyle Amor, Jack Ashworth. There can rarely have been a final, in any sport, where first is playing second but one team is such an overwhelming favourite. Warrington, without their leading try scorer, mercurial Australian stand-off Blake Austin, can be found at 11/4. Considering there are only teams in this final that is remarkable. However, the Wire only have to look at their own defeat in this very fixture last year to banish the idea that this is an impossible task. Although Steve Price might not want to bring up the 14-20 defeat to Catalans Dragons it could provide some inspiration. For Justin Holbrook and Saints it is time to deliver. The team were runaway leaders last year in the league and looking good in this competition but ended the season empty handed. With the St Helens coach back off to his native Australia at the end of the season his window for success is closing. It helps that prop Alex Walmsley, hooker James Roby and full-back Lachlan Coote are all back after they missed the recent league win at Leeds. Both teams will be named shortly and then we will see if the Wire can make this interesting. Let\u2019s hope so.",

      "bodyText": "Warrington produced a nerveless performance to win the Challenge Cup final against a St Helens side who buckled under the pressure. But the victors will know all too well how their opponents are feeling. They arrived at Wembley 12 months ago themselves heavy favourites to win this trophy before succumbing to expectation against Catalans. Steve Price may well have been exaggerating when he described his side as the biggest underdogs in the final\u2019s history, but he was right about one thing: nobody gave them a chance here. Warrington\u2019s gameplan was inch-perfect, their defensive qualities of the highest order. The three tries they scored ultimately secured the cup but in reality, you could point to any number of crucial try-saving tackles as being equally decisive. Without their marquee player, Blake Austin, Warrington had to do something different: they did that and more here. \u201cIt\u2019s a different feeling to last year,\u201d Price admitted afterwards. \u201cIt was a very hollow feeling last year, and it didn\u2019t sit well with this group what happened. This is the best performance since I\u2019ve been here at this club. We\u2019ve a special group of men here and we\u2019re going for the big one now.\u201d Joe Philbin had already crashed over from close-range for Warrington\u2019s opening try when Lachlan Coote uncharacteristically dropped a high ball, allowing Ben Murdoch-Masila to go over.

      "body": "<p>For Watford, the danger signs are clear. For West Ham, who knows? A breathless contest, in which defending was a dirty word from the outset, deservedly went the visitors\u2019 way and suggested their evident frailties might be counteracted by attacking potency. That was provided by S\u00e9bastien Haller, their record signing from Eintracht Frankfurt, who opened his account with two poacher\u2019s goals after Andre Gray had equalised Mark Noble\u2019s penalty. His new team have their first win but Watford, who will rue an extraordinary miss from Will Hughes at 1-1, remain pointless and must perk up urgently.</p> <p>A downbeat Javi Gracia knew it, admitting his team \u201chave to be more clinical\u201d. Watford produced 23 of the game\u2019s 39 shots but only three hit the target. Only Hughes will know how he did not improve that ratio when, in the 55th minute, he met Gray\u2019s fizzed centre at the far post after the striker had skipped around Lukasz Fabianski. It was a sitter but, perhaps seeing the ball late, Hughes turned it wide from a matter of inches. These things happen but Watford, who disintegrated thereafter, are in such desperate form that he may not see the funny side for some time.</p> <p>\u201cThe dynamic is not good; we need to improve something,\u201d said Gracia, whose team have lost seven games in a row and gone 18 without a clean sheet. Even then, Hughes\u2019s miss showed how fine the margins can be and it typified an encounter that was frayed, rattling fun throughout.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/24/norwich-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\">Tammy Abraham doubles up as Chelsea edge Norwich in five-goal thriller</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For a manager it must have verged on the shambolic at times and, during the first of two cooling breaks in the 25th minute, Manuel Pellegrini could be seen talking animatedly with his back line.</p> <p>His side had already ceded the lead.

      "bodyText": "For Watford, the danger signs are clear. For West Ham, who knows? A breathless contest, in which defending was a dirty word from the outset, deservedly went the visitors\u2019 way and suggested their evident frailties might be counteracted by attacking potency. That was provided by S\u00e9bastien Haller, their record signing from Eintracht Frankfurt, who opened his account with two poacher\u2019s goals after Andre Gray had equalised Mark Noble\u2019s penalty. His new team have their first win but Watford, who will rue an extraordinary miss from Will Hughes at 1-1, remain pointless and must perk up urgently. A downbeat Javi Gracia knew it, admitting his team \u201chave to be more clinical\u201d. Watford produced 23 of the game\u2019s 39 shots but only three hit the target. Only Hughes will know how he did not improve that ratio when, in the 55th minute, he met Gray\u2019s fizzed centre at the far post after the striker had skipped around Lukasz Fabianski. It was a sitter but, perhaps seeing the ball late, Hughes turned it wide from a matter of inches. These things happen but Watford, who disintegrated thereafter, are in such desperate form that he may not see the funny side for some time. \u201cThe dynamic is not good; we need to improve something,\u201d said Gracia, whose team have lost seven games in a row and gone 18 without a clean sheet. Even then, Hughes\u2019s miss showed how fine the margins can be and it typified an encounter that was frayed, rattling fun throughout. For a manager it must have verged on the shambolic at times and, during the first of two cooling breaks in the 25th minute, Manuel Pellegrini could be seen talking animatedly with his back line. His side had already ceded the lead. A minute had passed when Haller fudged a goalscoring opportunity but managed to chip across the area to Manuel Lanzini. Like his teammate, Lanzini appeared to have overcomplicated but salvation came via Abdoulaye Doucour\u00e9\u2019s clumsy foul. On the 15th anniversary of his debut, Noble beat Ben Foster and Vicarage Road hummed with concern.

      "body": "<p>Twenty-five years ago, during the summer of Blur\u2019s <em>Parklife</em> and Oasis\u2019s <em>Definitely Maybe</em>, a darker, stranger record was released that would soon become huge. Its title and mood was inspired by a 1970s TV drama of the same name, about a young deaf woman in Yorkshire who becomes a prostitute. The lyrics spoke of emotional extremes, sung in an extraordinary, rural-tinged, English blues by the Devon-born Beth Gibbons, of \u201cthe blackness, the darkness, forever\u201d in Wandering Star, or of the feeling that \u201cnobody loves me, it\u2019s true, not like you do\u201d in Sour Times.</p> <p>Its sound, woven together by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jun/24/geoff-barrow-soundtrack-of-my-life\" title=\"\">Geoff Barrow a</a>nd Adrian Utley, helped define what is known today in music as hauntology, the sampling of older, spectral sounds to evoke deeper cultural memories (Boards of Canada\u2019s TV-sampling electronica, Burial\u2019s dubstep, and the Ghost Box label\u2019s folk horror soundworlds would follow their lead). But despite its starkness, <em>Dummy</em> became a triple-platinum seller and a Mercury prizewinner, perhaps because it struck a nerve in what Barrow calls our \u201csonic unconscious\u2026 when sounds can merge with other sounds from somewhere else, and ultimately create emotion\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s a muggy, windy afternoon in a canalside corner of Bristol, the city where Portishead have been making music on and off since 1991. Barrow and Utley are in the studio of Barrow\u2019s record label, Invada, scuttling around drinking coffee and fiddling with a new synthesiser. Despite there being 15 years between them, they have a funny, sweary, fraternal camaraderie. Beth Gibbons is not here, as usual, despite requests: only two short interviews in the mid-1990s revealed the chattier person behind her mysterious persona. (She didn\u2019t do interviews either for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/mar/28/henryk-gorecki-symphony-no-3-review-minimalism-made-human\" title=\"\">her racked, bruising interpretation of G\u00f3recki\u2019s Third Symphony </a>with the Polish National Radio Symphony Orchestra, released earlier this year.)</p> <p>With no reissue to support <em>Dummy\u2019s</em> silver anniversary (a remaster was released in 2014), one wonders initially why we\u2019re here. The trio haven\u2019t released an album since 2008 (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/dec/11/portishead-third\" title=\"\">the abrasive, career-high <em>Third</em></a>) or played live since 2015; their last outing, in 2016, was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jun/22/exclusive-portishead-release-abba-sos-video-in-tribute-to-jo-cox\" title=\"\">startling, bleak cover of Abba\u2019s SOS </a>for the film <em>High Rise</em>. But as the two hours unfurl, it\u2019s obvious that this is Portishead\u2019s opportunity to settle scores, to present what <em>Dummy</em> really was. There are also hints that the Portishead story isn\u2019t quite finished yet. As we\u2019re settling down, they talk about needing to speak to Beth to get photos together \u201cfor something\u201d, but my nosy inquiries are quickly brushed aside.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c53493eab174715dc37965b854eef5792888815c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c53493eab174715dc37965b854eef5792888815c/0_10_1445_1445/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The sleeve of Dummy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The sleeve of Dummy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When the two men met, Barrow was a ponytailed 19-year-old making demos with the 26-year-old Gibbons at the city\u2019s Coach House Studios (Barrow and Gibbons had met at an Enterprise Allowance training day at the dole office in 1990: \u201cShe was a grown-up in my eyes,\u201d he says). Utley was 34, a bored jazz session guitarist finishing yet another job in a room downstairs. \u201cAnd I remember somebody opening the door upstairs and me hearing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57C_eWa2bgo\" title=\"\">It Could Be Sweet</a> [one of the first tracks written for <em>Dummy</em>]. I was all, \u2018Fuck me, what is that?\u2019 Just hearing the sub-bass and Beth\u2019s voice \u2013 it was unbelievable. Like a whole new world that was really exciting and vital.\u201d</p> <p>The three bonded quickly. Utley mined Barrow for his knowledge of sampling (\u201cTell me everything! How are they making that Queen track go on and off?\u201d), while Utley\u2019s collection of TV-recorded spy films introduced his bandmates to unusual sounds from instruments such as cimbaloms and theremins. \u201cIt was a really exciting time, because there was this amalgamation of ideas and a lifetime of separate discovery with all of us. And the fact that we brought it to each other\u2026\u201d Utley beams. \u201cIt was like a new love.\u201d</p> <p>Barrow and Gibbons\u2019s first ideas for songs had been recorded in Neneh Cherry\u2019s kitchen in London (Barrow had been hired by Cherry\u2019s husband and manager, Cameron McVey, to work on her second album, <em>Homebrew</em>, on which he co-wrote and co-produced the song Somedays; McVey spotted Barrow\u2019s talent when he worked as a trainee tape operator on Massive Attack\u2019s groundbreaking 1991 album <em>Blue Lines</em>). That working relationship had fallen apart. Barrow\u2019s mental health had also declined. \u201cI was in a terrible place. Through the Gulf war, I was really quite sick, physically and mentally. Mental stuff. I thought the war was the end of the world. I\u2019d never had a breakdown before \u2013 I think it was just the pressure of the Portishead stuff \u2013 I didn\u2019t know I was having it. And no one ever talked to me about mental health in any way.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re able to hide mental health issues within the music industry,\u201d Utley chips in. \u201cIt\u2019s completely acceptable to be a little bit crazy, drink too much or take too many drugs. It\u2019s like: \u2018Yeah, man, he was fucked last night\u2019. No one asks, \u2018why was he fucked?\u2019 I think that ignorance has been going on for ever.\u201d</p> <p><em>Dummy</em> motored on after Portishead, now a trio, moved to the Bristol district of Easton to record. \u201cThat was grim too,\u201d Barrow laughs. \u201cThe only place to eat was Iceland or this horrible pub called Granny\u2019s where your beans and chips would arrive with Granny\u2019s thumb in it.\u201d The lush soundscapes of <em>Dummy</em> rose from that bleakness. \u201cBut the process is never romantic, is it?\u201d Barrow continues. \u201cListen to how New Order made their first records, or whoever, and it\u2019s always going to be the same story. You\u2019re in some shithole somewhere that you\u2019ve made into something OK.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74c1968bc4f170c2eb1f23a45fdd69fbb0af323e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74c1968bc4f170c2eb1f23a45fdd69fbb0af323e/0_110_2562_1537/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Portishead performing on Later\u2026 With Jools Holland in 1994.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Portishead performing Glory Box on Later\u2026 With Jools Holland in 1994.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bristol has changed since then, but not in a good way, the men say. Homelessness and drugs problems are even bigger issues. \u201cPlus you go somewhere like St Pauls \u2013 which was very much a community of Caribbean people \u2013 and there\u2019s some posh student in a onesie,\u201d Utley says. \u201cReally privileged kids that have taken that area over.\u201d In 2017, Bristol was named the most desirable British city to live in by one survey, but also the most racially segregated by another. Its past has always been unpleasantly divided, says Barrow, citing a book called <em>A Darker History of Bristol</em>, which recounts its history with slavery. \u201cAnd still, lots of Bristol people only give a fuck about themselves,\u201d he adds. \u201cBut there\u2019s been an anti-establishment arts scene here too, for years, with a massive tongue in its cheek. It was there in the Pop Group, Smith and Mighty, the Wild Bunch, and Banksy [Barrow was music supervisor for Banksy\u2019s 2010 exhibition, Exit Through the Gift Shop]. It\u2019s always found itself.\u201d A note of hope, then? He shrugs, still unsure.</p> <p>Portishead have always been a political band on their own terms. A quote from Jo Cox (\u201cWe have far more in common than that which divides us\u201d) was featured in their 2016 video for SOS; it still sits on their website\u2019s landing page. Barrow and Utley also rant about Brexit, Trump and the Tories on Twitter feeds constantly; we meet four days after the new PM arrives, which Barrow calls \u201can absolute fucking disaster\u201d (he later retweets Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s plan to stop a no-deal Brexit).</p> <p>Utley also mentions Gibbons\u2019s lyrics being \u201cvery visceral and political\u201d about gender and the politics of relationships, despite their abstract nature. He recalls Gibbons pointed out a \u201cmansplaining\u201d incident in a restaurant, and it reflecting one of her songs (they don\u2019t mention the song, adding they don\u2019t discuss her lyrics in detail). Barrow also recalls sexist record company A&amp;Rs from their early days. \u201cThis real meat and veg vibe. Men going: \u2018What\u2019s this moaning bird on about?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>By winter 1994, <em>Dummy</em> was everywhere. And in January it went to No 3 in the charts, behind Celine Dion and the Beautiful South. Sour Times and Glory Box became top 15 singles. Then came the Mercury win, at which Barrow ranted about prizes being preposterous (\u201cI still agree with that\u201d). He also recalls his mum being cross with Paul Morley (\u201che\u2019d dissed us a bit\u201d) and chatting amiably to Noel Gallagher. \u201cI remember thinking, Oh, most musicians are dead normal. Or at least as mad as you.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF4RhDWs2DA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xF4RhDWs2DA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF4RhDWs2DA\">Watch the video for Wandering Star by Portishead.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Barrow and Utley\u2019s main beef is that <em>Dummy</em> is remembered as a sexy, chillout record in the UK. \u201cWhen people say that, I find it bizarre.\u201d He says Portishead had far more in common with Nirvana than any dance or chillout acts. \u201cI know that sounds ridiculous \u2013 but they also had these visceral chord changes, never being harmonically correct.\u201d He has a theory though: that the dance culture that happened in Britain didn\u2019t happen elsewhere on the same scale, \u201cso when everyone was partying and taking pills and coming down, the attitudes were different.\u201d Portishead are just seen as a vocal-led band elsewhere, he adds, with Gibbons as a Polly Harvey or Hope Sandoval figure. They\u2019re huge in France, Switzerland and the US, where <em>Third</em> entered the charts at No 7, and in Latin America: they played to 80,000 in Mexico City. Despite their recent silence, every Portishead musician remains busy. Barrow <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/annihilation-geoff-barrow-and-ben-salisbury-talk-its-haunting-score-197947/\" title=\"\">makes film scores with composer Ben Salisbury</a> (his latest for the Octavia Spencer and Naomi Watts film <em>Luce</em>, is released in the UK this November) and \u201creally loves\u201d playing live with his Krautrock-influenced band Beak. Utley has made a soundtrack with artist Gillian Wearing for a George Eliot documentary recently, worked on Anna Calvi\u2019s latest LP, and with the Paraorchestra of Great Britain on several projects.</p> <p>They\u2019re still passionate about new music. Both fathers, they like \u201cthat great gothy woman the kids like who makes stuff on Logic on her laptop\u201d (we work out it\u2019s Billie Eilish), James Holden, Idles, Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir and Sharon Van Etten (Barrow), Kate Tempest, Thurston Moore and Perfume Genius (Utley). Things they don\u2019t like include composer Nils Frahm, about whom they rant for five hilarious minutes. Barrow: \u201cHe\u2019ll change his scarf half way through to prove how important he is.\u201d Utley: \u201cHe\u2019s grade 3 piano. He\u2019s fucking Richard Clayderman.\u201d</p> <p>That joyous railing against everyone else, that sticking to one\u2019s guns, makes you wish for Portishead to return as a musical entity even sooner. Utley confirms he was the last to see Gibbons: \u201cThe other week for lunch. It was great. We slagged everything off!\u201d Will we see them back together soon? The men look at each other for a moment too long \u2013 moments later, as I start to leave, they\u2019re talking about the photographs again. \u201cIt\u2019s all up in the air, really,\u201d Utley says. \u201cIf the wind blows hard enough, you never know.\u201d</p> <p>As I leave, a gale outside roars. Darker, stranger things keep on happening.</p>",

It\u2019s a muggy, windy afternoon in a canalside corner of Bristol, the city where Portishead have been making music on and off since 1991. Barrow and Utley are in the studio of Barrow\u2019s record label, Invada, scuttling around drinking coffee and fiddling with a new synthesiser. Despite there being 15 years between them, they have a funny, sweary, fraternal camaraderie. Beth Gibbons is not here, as usual, despite requests: only two short interviews in the mid-1990s revealed the chattier person behind her mysterious persona. (She didn\u2019t do interviews either for her racked, bruising interpretation of G\u00f3recki\u2019s Third Symphony with the Polish National Radio Symphony Orchestra, released earlier this year.) With no reissue to support Dummy\u2019s silver anniversary (a remaster was released in 2014), one wonders initially why we\u2019re here. The trio haven\u2019t released an album since 2008 (the abrasive, career-high Third) or played live since 2015; their last outing, in 2016, was a startling, bleak cover of Abba\u2019s SOS for the film High Rise. But as the two hours unfurl, it\u2019s obvious that this is Portishead\u2019s opportunity to settle scores, to present what Dummy really was. There are also hints that the Portishead story isn\u2019t quite finished yet. As we\u2019re settling down, they talk about needing to speak to Beth to get photos together \u201cfor something\u201d, but my nosy inquiries are quickly brushed aside. When the two men met, Barrow was a ponytailed 19-year-old making demos with the 26-year-old Gibbons at the city\u2019s Coach House Studios (Barrow and Gibbons had met at an Enterprise Allowance training day at the dole office in 1990: \u201cShe was a grown-up in my eyes,\u201d he says). Utley was 34, a bored jazz session guitarist finishing yet another job in a room downstairs. \u201cAnd I remember somebody opening the door upstairs and me hearing It Could Be Sweet [one of the first tracks written for Dummy]. I was all, \u2018Fuck me, what is that?\u2019 Just hearing the sub-bass and Beth\u2019s voice \u2013 it was unbelievable. Like a whole new world that was really exciting and vital.\u201d The three bonded quickly. Utley mined Barrow for his knowledge of sampling (\u201cTell me everything! How are they making that Queen track go on and off?\u201d), while Utley\u2019s collection of TV-recorded spy films introduced his bandmates to unusual sounds from instruments such as cimbaloms and theremins. \u201cIt was a really exciting time, because there was this amalgamation of ideas and a lifetime of separate discovery with all of us. And the fact that we brought it to each other\u2026\u201d Utley beams. \u201cIt was like a new love.\u201d Barrow and Gibbons\u2019s first ideas for songs had been recorded in Neneh Cherry\u2019s kitchen in London (Barrow had been hired by Cherry\u2019s husband and manager, Cameron McVey, to work on her second album, Homebrew, on which he co-wrote and co-produced the song Somedays; McVey spotted Barrow\u2019s talent when he worked as a trainee tape operator on Massive Attack\u2019s groundbreaking 1991 album Blue Lines). That working relationship had fallen apart. Barrow\u2019s mental health had also declined. \u201cI was in a terrible place. Through the Gulf war, I was really quite sick, physically and mentally. Mental stuff. I thought the war was the end of the world. I\u2019d never had a breakdown before \u2013 I think it was just the pressure of the Portishead stuff \u2013 I didn\u2019t know I was having it. And no one ever talked to me about mental health in any way.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re able to hide mental health issues within the music industry,\u201d Utley chips in. \u201cIt\u2019s completely acceptable to be a little bit crazy, drink too much or take too many drugs. It\u2019s like: \u2018Yeah, man, he was fucked last night\u2019. No one asks, \u2018why was he fucked?\u2019 I think that ignorance has been going on for ever.\u201d Dummy motored on after Portishead, now a trio, moved to the Bristol district of Easton to record. \u201cThat was grim too,\u201d Barrow laughs. \u201cThe only place to eat was Iceland or this horrible pub called Granny\u2019s where your beans and chips would arrive with Granny\u2019s thumb in it.\u201d The lush soundscapes of Dummy rose from that bleakness. \u201cBut the process is never romantic, is it?\u201d Barrow continues. \u201cListen to how New Order made their first records, or whoever, and it\u2019s always going to be the same story. You\u2019re in some shithole somewhere that you\u2019ve made into something OK.\u201d Bristol has changed since then, but not in a good way, the men say. Homelessness and drugs problems are even bigger issues. \u201cPlus you go somewhere like St Pauls \u2013 which was very much a community of Caribbean people \u2013 and there\u2019s some posh student in a onesie,\u201d Utley says. \u201cReally privileged kids that have taken that area over.\u201d In 2017, Bristol was named the most desirable British city to live in by one survey, but also the most racially segregated by another. Its past has always been unpleasantly divided, says Barrow, citing a book called A Darker History of Bristol, which recounts its history with slavery. \u201cAnd still, lots of Bristol people only give a fuck about themselves,\u201d he adds. \u201cBut there\u2019s been an anti-establishment arts scene here too, for years, with a massive tongue in its cheek. It was there in the Pop Group, Smith and Mighty, the Wild Bunch, and Banksy [Barrow was music supervisor for Banksy\u2019s 2010 exhibition, Exit Through the Gift Shop]. It\u2019s always found itself.\u201d A note of hope, then? He shrugs, still unsure. Portishead have always been a political band on their own terms. A quote from Jo Cox (\u201cWe have far more in common than that which divides us\u201d) was featured in their 2016 video for SOS; it still sits on their website\u2019s landing page. Barrow and Utley also rant about Brexit, Trump and the Tories on Twitter feeds constantly; we meet four days after the new PM arrives, which Barrow calls \u201can absolute fucking disaster\u201d (he later retweets Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s plan to stop a no-deal Brexit). Utley also mentions Gibbons\u2019s lyrics being \u201cvery visceral and political\u201d about gender and the politics of relationships, despite their abstract nature. He recalls Gibbons pointed out a \u201cmansplaining\u201d incident in a restaurant, and it reflecting one of her songs (they don\u2019t mention the song, adding they don\u2019t discuss her lyrics in detail). Barrow also recalls sexist record company A&amp;Rs from their early days. \u201cThis real meat and veg vibe. Men going: \u2018What\u2019s this moaning bird on about?\u2019\u201d By winter 1994, Dummy was everywhere. And in January it went to No 3 in the charts, behind Celine Dion and the Beautiful South. Sour Times and Glory Box became top 15 singles. Then came the Mercury win, at which Barrow ranted about prizes being preposterous (\u201cI still agree with that\u201d). He also recalls his mum being cross with Paul Morley (\u201che\u2019d dissed us a bit\u201d) and chatting amiably to Noel Gallagher. \u201cI remember thinking, Oh, most musicians are dead normal. Or at least as mad as you.\u201d Barrow and Utley\u2019s main beef is that Dummy is remembered as a sexy, chillout record in the UK. \u201cWhen people say that, I find it bizarre.\u201d He says Portishead had far more in common with Nirvana than any dance or chillout acts. \u201cI know that sounds ridiculous \u2013 but they also had these visceral chord changes, never being harmonically correct.\u201d He has a theory though: that the dance culture that happened in Britain didn\u2019t happen elsewhere on the same scale, \u201cso when everyone was partying and taking pills and coming down, the attitudes were different.\u201d Portishead are just seen as a vocal-led band elsewhere, he adds, with Gibbons as a Polly Harvey or Hope Sandoval figure. They\u2019re huge in France, Switzerland and the US, where Third entered the charts at No 7, and in Latin America: they played to 80,000 in Mexico City. Despite their recent silence, every Portishead musician remains busy. Barrow makes film scores with composer Ben Salisbury (his latest for the Octavia Spencer and Naomi Watts film Luce, is released in the UK this November) and \u201creally loves\u201d playing live with his Krautrock-influenced band Beak. Utley has made a soundtrack with artist Gillian Wearing for a George Eliot documentary recently, worked on Anna Calvi\u2019s latest LP, and with the Paraorchestra of Great Britain on several projects. They\u2019re still passionate about new music. Both fathers, they like \u201cthat great gothy woman the kids like who makes stuff on Logic on her laptop\u201d (we work out it\u2019s Billie Eilish), James Holden, Idles, Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir and Sharon Van Etten (Barrow), Kate Tempest, Thurston Moore and Perfume Genius (Utley). Things they don\u2019t like include composer Nils Frahm, about whom they rant for five hilarious minutes. Barrow: \u201cHe\u2019ll change his scarf half way through to prove how important he is.\u201d Utley: \u201cHe\u2019s grade 3 piano. He\u2019s fucking Richard Clayderman.\u201d That joyous railing against everyone else, that sticking to one\u2019s guns, makes you wish for Portishead to return as a musical entity even sooner. Utley confirms he was the last to see Gibbons: \u201cThe other week for lunch. It was great. We slagged everything off!\u201d Will we see them back together soon? The men look at each other for a moment too long \u2013 moments later, as I start to leave, they\u2019re talking about the photographs again. \u201cIt\u2019s all up in the air, really,\u201d Utley says. \u201cIf the wind blows hard enough, you never know.\u201d As I leave, a gale outside roars. Darker, stranger things keep on happening.",

Mustajeer will head to the southern hemisphere leaving his former owners at Ger Lyons\u2019s Irish stable \u00a3600,000 better off, thanks to what was ultimately a comfortable success from stall two \u2013 only the second win for a runner from a single-figure draw in the last 11 years. Colin Keane got away from the stalls well and settled towards the front of the field as Ben Vrackie and Frankie Dettori set a good gallop. Mustajeer then moved up to challenge after passing the three-furlong pole and was in front with a quarter of a mile to run. The six-year-old, who was beaten less than a length at Group Three level earlier in the season, never looked likely to be caught from there. Red Galileo finished second for the leading apprentice Cieren Fallon, son of the former champion jockey Kieren, while Desert Skyline and Raymond Tusk also made the frame. Raheen House, heavily backed all day to start favourite at 5-1, was only 9th. \u201cThat\u2019s his last race for us,\u201d Kerri Lyons, her father\u2019s assistant trainer, said. \u201cHe\u2019s been sold to go to Australia but David [Spratt, Mustajeer\u2019s former owner] still owns a share. Hopefully it will be the Caulfield Cup and then the Melbourne Cup. \u201cThat will be a dream come true and he\u2019ll do well for the new owners [Australian Bloodstock]. Everything went to plan and credit goes to David and my dad, because David buys these horses at the horses-in-training sale and he has a great record with them. \u201cI think that\u2019s only his third win for us but he has been placed in quite a few races and it all came through today. We knew he would run well but you never know in these big handicaps what will happen and everything worked perfectly. He can get quite worked up at the start, so he went only once around the parade ring and we managed to keep a lid on him until he got to the start.\u201d Ger Lyons, who watched from his stable in County Meath, will receive nearly \u00a350,000 as his share of the Ebor\u2019s record prize fund but was apparently quite nonchalant about the outcome. \u201cFantastic performance by ctkjockey &amp; Mustajeer and my team winning the Ebor,\u201d Lyons said on Twitter shortly afterwards. \u201cNow I\u2019m off out to cut the grass.\u201d Mustajeer is quoted at 16-1 by Paddy Power for the Melbourne Cup at Flemington Park on 5 November. At Goodwood Rossa Ryan recorded the first Group Two success of his career at the first attempt as his mount Duke Of Hazzard stayed on strongly to win the Celebration Mile. Ryan, who is in his first season without a claim, was replacing PJ McDonald, who was aboard Duke Of Hazzard when the colt took a Group Three over the same course and distance earlier in the month. Ryan rode a well-judged race to lead well inside the final furlong before holding off the late charge of Turgenev. \u201cI didn\u2019t sleep very well last night,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cI spent all night on my tablet going through all the form and working out how the race would pan out. When PJ had commitments at York, it meant a lot to me to be given the chance riding a horse of such high profile.\u201d",

Amazon has announced new Alexa applications under development, including ones that manage health-improvement goals, handle blood-sugar readings and book appointments.

Neither it nor Haven responded to multiple requests for comment for this article. In mid-2017, it was reported that the online retail giant had set up a secretive lab to explore tech-driven healthcare disruption called <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/report-amazon-pursues-healthcare-tech-1492-lab-2017-7?r=US&amp;IR=T\" title=\"\">Amazon 1492</a>, presumably named after the year Columbus first arrived in the Americas as a signal of its paradigm-shifting ambitions.</p> <p>Becker and others believe the company is working towards the launch of an Amazon Prime service for healthcare. The company already knows a lot about its customers, including their reading preferences, education levels, approximate weight if they buy clothes, search histories, and the eating habits of customers of its Whole Foods subsidiary. Add to this data from AI-powered extraction from medical records, Alexa, fitness trackers and connected medical devices like blood-pressure monitors and glucometers, and Amazon will know those who sign up inside out.</p> <p>A Prime Health virtual doctor could decide whether you need a human doctor or just to stock up on tissues, for example. Appointments could be much simpler and quicker to book. Patients with chronic diseases or those recently discharged from hospital could be remotely monitored at home, while medication could become cheaper and quicker to access. Alexa could provide alerts and personalised health advice, and even reward healthy choices.</p> <p>\u201cThese elements are being deployed incrementally, and I think when we step back, what we\u2019ll see from Amazon is fully curated digital-first healthcare that, for example, only brings in your GP when and where it makes sense,\u201d says Becker.</p> <p>He is not alone in his analysis. Silicon Valley venture capitalist John Doerr, a friend of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, told a conference in November: \u201cImagine what it\u2019s going to be like when he [Bezos] rolls out Prime Health, which I\u2019m convinced he will.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea2587075c11cfaf287ec4c1ed3a86efce8848f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea2587075c11cfaf287ec4c1ed3a86efce8848f5/0_0_2771_3167/875.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration by James Melaugh.\" width=\"875\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration by James Melaugh.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: James Melaugh/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Amazon and the NHS</h2> <p>But aren\u2019t Amazon\u2019s ambitious, data-driven plans more relevant in the US than in the UK, where all have access to free-at-the-point-of-delivery, more or less comprehensive care? In fact, NHS patients have been using virtual GP services for some time. The most high profile is London-based <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/02/gp-smartphone-apps-threat-to-nhs\" title=\"\">Babylon Health</a>, which has more than 50,000 registered patients and recently launched in Birmingham.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The incentive for companies like Amazon is to increase profits, which puts them at odds with the goals the NHS</p> <footer> <cite>Jeff Becker</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Most observers expect digital healthcare providers, both big and small, to work with rather than in competition with NHS providers, as they are already doing. \u201cThese changes are relevant globally,\u201d says Becker. \u201cThere would be real benefits to the UK public in some of the digital innovations inspired by the kinds of incubator models being generated in Haven. Like the NHS-Alexa deal, I think it will be a partnership rather than an alternative.\u201d</p> <p>Others, however, believe the commercial imperatives of the tech giants conflict with the public service values of the NHS. \u201cWhat does return on investment look like in healthcare?\u201d asks Mathana Stender, a Berlin-based tech ethicist. \u201cThe incentives of companies like Amazon are to increase market share, share prices and profits, which puts them at odds with the underlying goals of a public health system like the NHS.\u201d</p> <p>Some fear that free-market tech evangelist politicians would be more than happy to cut NHS funding and invite private companies to fill the gap. However, <a href=\"https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/about-us/whos-who/matthew-honeyman\" title=\"\">Matthew Honeyman</a>, of health thinktank the King\u2019s Fund, says those primarily interested in cutting costs shouldn\u2019t expect quick gains. \u201cThese kinds of transformations do bring efficiencies and productivity benefits, but our research suggests these take years to come through.\u201d</p> <h2>Can I trust Amazon with my health data? </h2> <p>The most widespread concerns relate to data protection. Last month it was revealed that contractors working on quality control of Apple\u2019s Siri voice assistant regularly hear recordings of confidential conversations, including doctor-patient discussions. In 2017, London\u2019s Royal Free hospital <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jul/03/google-deepmind-16m-patient-royal-free-deal-data-protection-act\" title=\"\">was rebuked for failing to comply</a> with the Data Protection Act when it handed over the personal data of 1.6 million patients to Google\u2019s DeepMind as part of efforts to develop an early diagnosis system.</p> <p>Amazon has promised that UK patients who asked Alexa for health advice would have their data encrypted, but critics demand more specifics on how patient data is protected. \u201cWe need more detail and transparency about how people\u2019s sensitive data will be processed and used when they ask Alexa a question,\u201d says Honeyman.</p> <p>Others say there are privacy risks even if big tech companies do make stringent efforts to protect patient data. \u201cEven using the most sophisticated anonymisation techniques, given enough data points, it may become possible to de-anonymise individuals in future,\u201d says Stender, also a fellow at the Centre for Internet and Human Rights at the Viadrina European University in Frankfurt an der Oder.</p> <p>Healthcare is widely considered a \u201cdigital laggard\u201d compared with other sectors. But the pace of change is quickening. Amazon and the other major tech companies have become rich and powerful in large part by realising the value of and monetising data. Critics highlight what they say is their poor data protection track record, and warn of irreparable damage to our privacy if the same approach is applied to personal health data. Few doubt digital disruption can bring big gains in healthcare. Less clear is whether Amazon and its ilk can or should be trusted to play central roles in the new era of data-driven healthcare they are carving out for themselves.</p> <h2>It\u2019s not just Amazon</h2> <p>Jeff Bezos\u2019s firm is far from alone in looking to disrupt healthcare with data and technology. Apple is rolling out its Health Records feature designed to make it easier fo users to visualise, use and store medical data on their iPhones. The latest Apple watches have ECG sensors that can alert users if they have potentially dangerous irregular heart rhythms. The Google-owned company DeepMind last month <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2212100-its-too-soon-to-tell-if-deepminds-medical-ai-will-save-any-lives/\" title=\"\">claimed its AI algorithm could predict acute kidney injury</a> \u2013 which kills 100,000 people per year in the UK \u2013 48 hours before it happened. Startups are working on everything from smart pill bottles and clinical-grade home diagnosis kits, to mental health tracking and personalised nutrition plans tailored to specific health needs.</p> <p>Government ministers including self-proclaimed techie, health secretary Matt Hancock, and other health leaders agree that data and tech can transform healthcare for the better. A Department of Health and Social Care <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-future-of-healthcare-our-vision-for-digital-data-and-technology-in-health-and-care/the-future-of-healthcare-our-vision-for-digital-data-and-technology-in-health-and-care\" title=\"\">policy paper published in October last year</a> outlines a strategy built on open standards, data security and interoperability of modular systems.</p> <p>Since 2016, NHS England has been awarding grants of up to \u00a310m to digitally advanced NHS trusts to create blueprints for others to follow. Early examples include integrated care records, an AI-driven sepsis early warning system, an online platform for patients to play an active role in managing inflammatory bowel disease, and the use of Alexa in adult social care.</p>",

Like the NHS-Alexa deal, I think it will be a partnership rather than an alternative.\u201d Others, however, believe the commercial imperatives of the tech giants conflict with the public service values of the NHS. \u201cWhat does return on investment look like in healthcare?\u201d asks Mathana Stender, a Berlin-based tech ethicist. \u201cThe incentives of companies like Amazon are to increase market share, share prices and profits, which puts them at odds with the underlying goals of a public health system like the NHS.\u201d Some fear that free-market tech evangelist politicians would be more than happy to cut NHS funding and invite private companies to fill the gap. However, Matthew Honeyman, of health thinktank the King\u2019s Fund, says those primarily interested in cutting costs shouldn\u2019t expect quick gains. \u201cThese kinds of transformations do bring efficiencies and productivity benefits, but our research suggests these take years to come through.\u201d Can I trust Amazon with my health data? The most widespread concerns relate to data protection. Last month it was revealed that contractors working on quality control of Apple\u2019s Siri voice assistant regularly hear recordings of confidential conversations, including doctor-patient discussions. In 2017, London\u2019s Royal Free hospital was rebuked for failing to comply with the Data Protection Act when it handed over the personal data of 1.6 million patients to Google\u2019s DeepMind as part of efforts to develop an early diagnosis system. Amazon has promised that UK patients who asked Alexa for health advice would have their data encrypted, but critics demand more specifics on how patient data is protected. \u201cWe need more detail and transparency about how people\u2019s sensitive data will be processed and used when they ask Alexa a question,\u201d says Honeyman. Others say there are privacy risks even if big tech companies do make stringent efforts to protect patient data. \u201cEven using the most sophisticated anonymisation techniques, given enough data points, it may become possible to de-anonymise individuals in future,\u201d says Stender, also a fellow at the Centre for Internet and Human Rights at the Viadrina European University in Frankfurt an der Oder. Healthcare is widely considered a \u201cdigital laggard\u201d compared with other sectors. But the pace of change is quickening. Amazon and the other major tech companies have become rich and powerful in large part by realising the value of and monetising data. Critics highlight what they say is their poor data protection track record, and warn of irreparable damage to our privacy if the same approach is applied to personal health data. Few doubt digital disruption can bring big gains in healthcare. Less clear is whether Amazon and its ilk can or should be trusted to play central roles in the new era of data-driven healthcare they are carving out for themselves. It\u2019s not just Amazon Jeff Bezos\u2019s firm is far from alone in looking to disrupt healthcare with data and technology. Apple is rolling out its Health Records feature designed to make it easier fo users to visualise, use and store medical data on their iPhones. The latest Apple watches have ECG sensors that can alert users if they have potentially dangerous irregular heart rhythms. The Google-owned company DeepMind last month claimed its AI algorithm could predict acute kidney injury \u2013 which kills 100,000 people per year in the UK \u2013 48 hours before it happened. Startups are working on everything from smart pill bottles and clinical-grade home diagnosis kits, to mental health tracking and personalised nutrition plans tailored to specific health needs. Government ministers including self-proclaimed techie, health secretary Matt Hancock, and other health leaders agree that data and tech can transform healthcare for the better. A Department of Health and Social Care policy paper published in October last year outlines a strategy built on open standards, data security and interoperability of modular systems. Since 2016, NHS England has been awarding grants of up to \u00a310m to digitally advanced NHS trusts to create blueprints for others to follow. Early examples include integrated care records, an AI-driven sepsis early warning system, an online platform for patients to play an active role in managing inflammatory bowel disease, and the use of Alexa in adult social care.",

Banks and other financial institutions pushed the policies alongside loans, mortgages, credit cards and other deals, with the promise that they would pay out if borrowers found themselves unable to work owing to illness, injury or redundancy. However, in many cases, the policy exclusions meant customers could never make a claim. The most frequent exclusion was \u201cself-employment\u201d.</p> <p>The final deadline for complaining about the sale of PPI is 29 August 2019. Anyone who has not complained to their provider by that date will not be able to claim money back.</p> <p>Banks have been repeatedly forced to announce they are setting aside yet more cash to cover claims.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) \u2013 which has been running a major campaign to raise awareness of the deadline \u2013 said that in the last eight weeks it had experienced a 420% surge in website activity and a 269% increase in calls compared to the previous eight weeks. Lloyds revealed late last month that while it had been fielding about 70,000 pre-complaint information requests relating to PPI each week, that had leapt to around 190,000 per week.</p> <p>The banks have railed against speculative claims, but on Friday the Competition and Markets Authority rebuked RBS and Santander for failing to send annual reminders to customers about their PPI policies and their right to claim.</p> <p>Even dead people are eligible to make a PPI claim: solicitors dealing with probate have been asking the relatives of deceased individuals if they wish to take action on that person\u2019s behalf before the deadline. Any payout would then become part of the dead person\u2019s estate. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/payment-protection-insurance-ppi-claims-and-the-official-receiver\" title=\"\">the official receiver</a> is pursuing outstanding compensation payouts in respect of bankrupt and insolvent individuals to ensure creditors receive what they are owed.</p> <p>The deadline is aimed at drawing a line under the scandal in order to rebuild public trust in financial services and reduce uncertainty for banks and other companies worried about the open-ended nature of potential PPI liabilities.</p> <p>But the claims management industry is furious, and believes many consumers will miss out on the chance to reclaim what is rightfully theirs. Last week, the Alliance of Claims Companies (ACC) trade body attacked what it claimed was an \u201cartificially enforced deadline put in by the FCA to protect the banks\u201d. It said an estimated \u00a350bn of PPI policies were sold, and that while \u00a336bn had been paid out in redress, around half of that was interest. \u201cEven allowing for the fact that some PPI policies were not mis-sold, you can see that this scandal is nowhere near over, and billions of pounds remain with the banks and lenders and not with consumers,\u201d said the ACC.</p> <p>Emma Stranack, the lead for the FCA\u2019s PPI deadline campaign, said \u201cnow is the time to act,\u201d and that it had extended its helpline hours to 8pm on weeknights and 5pm on Saturdays: \u201cUltimately we don\u2019t want the UK public to miss their chance to decide.\u201d</p> <h2>What\u2019s the next big claim?</h2> <p>Call up one the biggest PPI claims firms \u2013 The Claims Guys \u2013 and its automated phone system soon reveals where the next bonanza in payouts may lie. Press two, it says, for claims concerning \u201cpackaged bank accounts\u201d, three for \u201cpayday loans\u201d, or press four if your complaint stems from an \u201cinvestment product\u201d.</p> <p>As the PPI finale approaches, the claims management firms have been trying to fill the void and keep at least some staff employed. What they\u2019ve been searching for is systemic mis-selling, which is why \u201cpackaged\u201d accounts could be the next big thing. These were bank accounts that offered \u201cfree\u201d travel or phone insurance, car breakdown cover, and other \u201cbenefits\u201d \u2013 all for a \u00a310-\u00a313 monthly fee.</p> <p>The problem for the banks is that years ago, when these were being heavily sold in branches, staff rarely took the trouble to ask whether those signing up could actually use the benefits, or already had cover for things like breakdowns. Someone without a car or phone, or who rarely travelled abroad, was clearly wasting their money paying for such an account, and may have a case against the bank. The sums will be smaller than for PPI, but a claim\u2019s a claim.</p> <p>Similarly, prior to 2013, most independent financial advisers received commissions for selling investment and pension products to consumers. If claims firms can prove that the IFA sold clients the investment that made them the most commission, rather than the product that was most suitable, they have a potential refund.</p> <p>Next up is payday loans, although this looks more difficult.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s a date that some in Britain have been dreading, but that for others can\u2019t come too soon. No, not 31 October, the Brexit date, but 29 August \u2013 the final deadline for complaints about payment protection insurance (PPI). At 11.59pm this coming Thursday, the UK\u2019s financial regulators will bring down the shutters on Britain\u2019s costliest ever consumer scandal. At the latest count, \u00a336bn has been paid out by UK banks to compensate people who bought often-worthless insurance cover thinking it would help them repay debts in the event of sickness or unemployment. Of that, \u00a32bn was paid between 1 January and 30 June this year. The total bill has hit \u00a348.5bn once administration costs are included \u2013 five times the cost of the London 2012 Olympics, according to the thinktank New City Agenda. And with an official \u201cnow is the time to act\u201d advertising campaign in full swing, and claims management companies engaged in a final push to grab a share of the spoils, those numbers will almost certainly rise. It is not just the claims firms \u2013 which have pocketed billions of pounds of the compensation paid to victims, and in many cases have plagued millions of people with spam text messages and nuisance calls \u2013 that stand to lose out from the end of this \u201cgravy train\u201d. There is an argument that the payouts resulting from the scandal \u2013 which at one point averaged \u00a32,750 a head \u2013 have amounted to a sizeable fiscal stimulus that has helped keep the wheels of the UK economy going over the last decade. In many cases, that handout of free, no-strings cash has been a welcome windfall that has been quickly spent on a holiday or home appliances, put towards a new car, or used to pay for home improvements or weddings. And at one point the boom in jobs linked to the processing of all those claims registered in the official labour market statistics as one of the fastest growing areas of employment. In early 2014, the then economics editor at the BBC, Robert Peston, wrote that one of his \u201cnagging worries\u201d about the British economy was: \u201cWhat happens when the PPI payments stop flowing?\u201d. Well, we are about to find out. As many as 64 million PPI policies were sold in the UK, mostly between 1990 and 2010, and some as far back as the 1970s \u2013 but very often this cover was mis-sold. Banks and other financial institutions pushed the policies alongside loans, mortgages, credit cards and other deals, with the promise that they would pay out if borrowers found themselves unable to work owing to illness, injury or redundancy. However, in many cases, the policy exclusions meant customers could never make a claim. The most frequent exclusion was \u201cself-employment\u201d. The final deadline for complaining about the sale of PPI is 29 August 2019. Anyone who has not complained to their provider by that date will not be able to claim money back. Banks have been repeatedly forced to announce they are setting aside yet more cash to cover claims. Lloyds Banking Group has been hit with the biggest bill: to date, just over \u00a320bn. With days to go until the deadline, last week saw a late flurry of activity as genuine claimants finally got around to submitting their complaints, and others tried their luck. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) \u2013 which has been running a major campaign to raise awareness of the deadline \u2013 said that in the last eight weeks it had experienced a 420% surge in website activity and a 269% increase in calls compared to the previous eight weeks. Lloyds revealed late last month that while it had been fielding about 70,000 pre-complaint information requests relating to PPI each week, that had leapt to around 190,000 per week. The banks have railed against speculative claims, but on Friday the Competition and Markets Authority rebuked RBS and Santander for failing to send annual reminders to customers about their PPI policies and their right to claim. Even dead people are eligible to make a PPI claim: solicitors dealing with probate have been asking the relatives of deceased individuals if they wish to take action on that person\u2019s behalf before the deadline. Any payout would then become part of the dead person\u2019s estate. Meanwhile, the official receiver is pursuing outstanding compensation payouts in respect of bankrupt and insolvent individuals to ensure creditors receive what they are owed. The deadline is aimed at drawing a line under the scandal in order to rebuild public trust in financial services and reduce uncertainty for banks and other companies worried about the open-ended nature of potential PPI liabilities. But the claims management industry is furious, and believes many consumers will miss out on the chance to reclaim what is rightfully theirs. Last week, the Alliance of Claims Companies (ACC) trade body attacked what it claimed was an \u201cartificially enforced deadline put in by the FCA to protect the banks\u201d. It said an estimated \u00a350bn of PPI policies were sold, and that while \u00a336bn had been paid out in redress, around half of that was interest. \u201cEven allowing for the fact that some PPI policies were not mis-sold, you can see that this scandal is nowhere near over, and billions of pounds remain with the banks and lenders and not with consumers,\u201d said the ACC. Emma Stranack, the lead for the FCA\u2019s PPI deadline campaign, said \u201cnow is the time to act,\u201d and that it had extended its helpline hours to 8pm on weeknights and 5pm on Saturdays: \u201cUltimately we don\u2019t want the UK public to miss their chance to decide.\u201d What\u2019s the next big claim? Call up one the biggest PPI claims firms \u2013 The Claims Guys \u2013 and its automated phone system soon reveals where the next bonanza in payouts may lie. Press two, it says, for claims concerning \u201cpackaged bank accounts\u201d, three for \u201cpayday loans\u201d, or press four if your complaint stems from an \u201cinvestment product\u201d. As the PPI finale approaches, the claims management firms have been trying to fill the void and keep at least some staff employed. What they\u2019ve been searching for is systemic mis-selling, which is why \u201cpackaged\u201d accounts could be the next big thing. These were bank accounts that offered \u201cfree\u201d travel or phone insurance, car breakdown cover, and other \u201cbenefits\u201d \u2013 all for a \u00a310-\u00a313 monthly fee. The problem for the banks is that years ago, when these were being heavily sold in branches, staff rarely took the trouble to ask whether those signing up could actually use the benefits, or already had cover for things like breakdowns. Someone without a car or phone, or who rarely travelled abroad, was clearly wasting their money paying for such an account, and may have a case against the bank. The sums will be smaller than for PPI, but a claim\u2019s a claim. Similarly, prior to 2013, most independent financial advisers received commissions for selling investment and pension products to consumers. If claims firms can prove that the IFA sold clients the investment that made them the most commission, rather than the product that was most suitable, they have a potential refund. Next up is payday loans, although this looks more difficult. Customers who signed up for short-term, high-cost loans were often sold them on the basis that they would borrow \u00a3100 and pay back \u00a3150, when they should have been told the real annual percentage rate (APR). Those who took multiple loans may have significant claims \u2013 if the provider is still around. Wonga blamed a surge in claims, in part, for its collapse. Other areas that the claims firms have moved into is EU airline delay compensation, which is worth \u20ac250-\u20ac600 a passenger, and which \u2013 depending on how Brexit works out \u2013 may or may not have a future. Finally, there is always the old favourite: personal injury claims. Expect more calls to your mobile commiserating with you after your car accident. Miles Brignall",

The Exeter forward was due to undergo a scan on Saturday evening, but his prospects of making it to Japan now appear forlorn.</p> <p>Seymour, forced off in the 17th minute, and Thomson, who departed early in the second half on his Test debut, will both be subject to head injury protocols after failing their assessments. Particular care will be exercised with Thomson, who only returned for the Scarlets at the end of last season after a concussion sustained in November kept him out for five months.</p> <p>Townsend, set to name his final squad on 3 September, confirmed that all three players are likely to miss this week\u2019s trip to Tbilisi, where Scotland will become the first tier-one nation to play in Georgia next Saturday, before facing the same opponents at Murrayfield in their final warm-up Test.</p> <p>While the head coach took heart from an improved defensive display, as in Nice they conceded a try inside two minutes. Peter Horne, with the French defence up fast, threw a terrible pass that was picked off by Penaud, who raced home from halfway untouched.</p> <p>Thomas Ramos converted for an early 7-0 lead, but Greig Laidlaw, returning to the side as captain, got Scotland on the board with a penalty in the fifth minute.</p> <p>Thomson\u2019s first major contribution was a thumping hit on halfway that led to a turnover, only for Scotland to waste Maitland\u2019s break down the left when Ryan Wilson was penalised for going off his feet.</p> <p>That aside, Wilson surely laid claim to one of the likely five back-row spots in the World Cup squad with a combative display, Hamish Watson\u2019s return at openside also galvanising the Scots.

      "bodyText": "A week after being obliterated in Nice, Scotland turned the tables on France to end a run of five Tests without a win and bolster their World Cup preparations with a comeback victory at Murrayfield. Down 14-3 after 27 minutes after two tries from France wing Damian Penaud, converted scores from Sean Maitland and Chris Harris either side of the interval put Gregor Townsend\u2019s side into a lead they held onto tenaciously in a scoreless final quarter. The warm glow of a raucously received victory was offset, however, by injury concerns over the lock Sam Skinner, No 8 Blade Thomson and winger Tommy Seymour. Skinner, whose ability to also play at blindside flanker made him a probable member of the final 31-man party, was helped off before the hour with a serious-looking hamstring injury. The Exeter forward was due to undergo a scan on Saturday evening, but his prospects of making it to Japan now appear forlorn. Seymour, forced off in the 17th minute, and Thomson, who departed early in the second half on his Test debut, will both be subject to head injury protocols after failing their assessments. Particular care will be exercised with Thomson, who only returned for the Scarlets at the end of last season after a concussion sustained in November kept him out for five months. Townsend, set to name his final squad on 3 September, confirmed that all three players are likely to miss this week\u2019s trip to Tbilisi, where Scotland will become the first tier-one nation to play in Georgia next Saturday, before facing the same opponents at Murrayfield in their final warm-up Test. While the head coach took heart from an improved defensive display, as in Nice they conceded a try inside two minutes. Peter Horne, with the French defence up fast, threw a terrible pass that was picked off by Penaud, who raced home from halfway untouched. Thomas Ramos converted for an early 7-0 lead, but Greig Laidlaw, returning to the side as captain, got Scotland on the board with a penalty in the fifth minute. Thomson\u2019s first major contribution was a thumping hit on halfway that led to a turnover, only for Scotland to waste Maitland\u2019s break down the left when Ryan Wilson was penalised for going off his feet. That aside, Wilson surely laid claim to one of the likely five back-row spots in the World Cup squad with a combative display, Hamish Watson\u2019s return at openside also galvanising the Scots. Of the other World Cup hopefuls, Skinner showed up well until his untimely injury, and second-row partner Scott Cummings grafted hard on his first Test start. In midfield, Horne recovered well from his early lapse and Harris capped a solid outing with a well-taken try. Whether it is enough to edge him ahead of Huw Jones remains to be seen. The second French try was again soft from a Scottish perspective. Centre Sofiane Guitoune motored through a yawning gap before feeding Penaud on the right flank for an easy run-in. Props Willem Nel and Gordon Reid brought stability to the scrum though and Scotland got they fillip they needed just before half-time. Blair Kinghorn, on as a replacement for Seymour, snaffled a long pass intended for Penaud in the French 22. Harris kept it alive, and swift recycling saw Finn Russell put Maitland over in the left corner. Laidlaw added a majestic touchline conversion to give the half-time score a far healthier sheen from a home perspective. The hosts butchered a chance to take the lead on the resumption when Russell\u2019s cross-kick found Kinghorn on the right flank but Stuart Hogg could not take his inside pass. Scotland were ahead in the 58th minute, Wilson and Watson taking them to within a metre of the French line before Harris barrelled onto Laidlaw\u2019s short pass to dive over at the posts. Laidlaw\u2019s conversion took Scotland 17-14 clear, and they might have had further tries, Hogg claiming his own kick ahead in a thrilling break before a knock-on killed the move. \u201cIt was not a perfect performance clearly,\u201d said Townsend. \u201cBut I was satisfied to see how the players found a way to win against a team that beat them comfortably a week ago.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Jacob Steinberg was at Carrow Road to see Chelsea beat newly-promoted Norwich by the odd goal of five in an entertaining lunchtime game. An email: \u201cYour very own You Are The Ref explained that any contact with a goalkeeper whilst he has both feet off the ground, and both hands on the ball, is a foul,\u201d writes Dan C. \u201cIt also explained that no pundit seems to know that.\u201d I\u2019m not so sure that Giroud made contact with with Krul while he had both hands on the ball. I\u2019ll wait for a replay and see if that\u2019s the case. VAR: The monitor-monitoring assistants in Stockley Park had a busy day today. Their checks resulted in a perfectly good Chelsea goal being disallowed, Ben Godfrey escaping a dismissal for a fairly obvious red card offence and Chelsea somehow not getting a penalty for a blatant Marco Stiepermann foul on Cesar Azpilicueta in the Norwich box. Well done, VAR. Well done. Tammy Abraham: \u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019ve always dreamed of,\u201d says Chelsea\u2019s striker in an interview with BT Sport, upon asked how he feels after scoring his first goals for Chelsea, 15 years \u2013 and 60 goals on loan at other teams - after joining the club. \u201cGetting in the first team and scoring. I was always confident I could do it.\u201d Chelsea win: Frank Lampard and his players milk the applause of the travelling fans before heading to the sanctuary of the dressing-room. Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeep! It\u2019s all over at Carrow Road, where Chelsea have won an entertaining game by the odd goal of five. Frank Lampard has secured his first win as Chelsea manager, while Tammy Abraham scored twice to get off the mark for the season. Mason Mount also scored his second in two games for Chelsea, before hobbling off lame. Norwich played quite impressively too, coming from behind twice in the first half courtesy of goals from Todd Cantwell and Teemu Pukki. 90+4 min: Willian tries his luck, but fires wide from distance. Now Kurt Zouma is down injured, having hurt the small of his back after leaping to contest a high ball. 90+3 min: Ross Barkley wins a corner for Chelsea after a shot from distance is tipped wide of the upright by Tim Krul. Nothing comes of the set-piece. 90+1 min: We\u2019re into the first of five added minutes. Can Chelsea hang on for a victory that ultimately they deserve? After a very even first half, they\u2019ve dominated since the break. For all that, their defence is a bit of a mess and needs a lot of work. The imminent return of Antonio Rudiger should help. 88 min: Mason Mount goes down injured and there are raucous boos as Norwich put the ball out of play. Mount appears to have injured his thigh and is going to be replaced by Marcos Alonso. 86 min: Ben Godfrey leaves one in on Mason Mount, stamping on his instep with a late challenge. It\u2019s a definite yellow card offence and possibly a red. Following a VAR check, he escapes with any censure. I\u2019m not sure what the lads in VAR Towers are drinking this afternoon, but I wouldn\u2019t mind a drop of it. Chelsea substitution: Willian on for Christian Pulisic. 84 min: According to BT Sport\u2019s referee-in-residence Peter Walton, Martin Atkinson initially awarded a goal to Kurt Zouma, only for VAR to urge him to change his mind, because Olivier Giroud had backed into Tim Krul as the goalkeeper tried to catch a ball dropping out of the sky. That wasn\u2019t the way I read the situation and I\u2019m convinced Giroud didn\u2019t foul Krul. Norwich triple-substitution: Kenny McClean, Mario Vrancic and Dennis Srbeny on for Moritz Leitner, Tom Trybull and Marco Stiepermann. 78 min: Kurt Zouma bundles the ball home after Tim Krul had leaped to catch it, only to fumble under pressure from Olivier Giroud, who had leapt in front of him but didn\u2019t make contact with the goalkeeper. No goal is awarded, despite a VAR consultation. It looked a perfectly fine goal to me, but as we all know, strikers aren\u2019t allowed jump in the same postal code as goalkeepers without the man in gloves getting a free-kick. 76 min: Good play from Mason Mount, who dummies a low cross from Pulisic to let the ball run on to Ross Barkley just outside the penalty area. He shoots and his effort is on target, but is blocked by Ben Godfrey. 75 min: Chelsea substitution: Tammy Abraham goes off to be replaced by Olivier Giroud. He gets a standing ovation from the travelling Chelsea fans. 74 min: Free-kick for Norwich after a Pulisic foul on Cantwell. Nothing comes of it. 72 min: Ben Godfrey wins a corner after a rampaging run up the inside left and then almost scores, hitting the cross-bar after getting on the end of the ensuing inswinger. 71 min: Tammy Abraham has answered a few of his critics, me among them, with his brace today. Those two goals will do wonders for his confidence, as I suspect he was beginning to feel a bit of pressure after drawing blanks in his opening three games. Chelsea retake the lead. Tammy Abraham picks up a Pulisic pass from midfield, takes the ball away from Grant Hanley with an excellent first touch and advances towards the edge of the penalty area. From there, he shoots low into the bottom left-hand corner. 66 min: Ross Barkley tries his luck with a shot from distance. He fires straight at Tim Krul. 64 min: The more I see of that Stiepermann challenge on Azpilicueta, the more baffling I find it that the ref\u2019s original decision to ignore it wasn\u2019t overturned on the advice of the men in VAR HQ. It was a clear foul on the Chelsea full-back. 61 min: Cesar Azpilicueta is unhappy with referee Martin Atkinson. He feels he should have had a spot-kick after being caught on the knee by a Marco Stiepermann challenge in the Norwich City penalty area. It seems that VAR have had a look at it but didn\u2019t think it was worth overturning. It looked a stone-wall penalty to me. 61 min: A promising Norwich counter-attack is stopped by a good tackle by Mateo Kovacic on Teemu Pukki. 60 min: Chelsea win a corner. Mount curls the ball towards the far post, but Tim Krul comes off his line to punch it clear. 59 min: Mount tries a shot from distance, but his effort is blocked too. 57 min: More Chelsea dominance. Azpilicueta shoots from just inside the Norwich penalty area, but Ben Godfrey blocks. Moments later, Ross Barkley dances past four Norwich defenders to tee up Azpilicueta for another shot, which fizzes wide. Norwich are really under the cosh here. 56 min: Emerson tries to pick out Tammy Abraham with a cross from the left, but Grant Hanley out-jumps the striker to clear. 55 min: Chelsea have dominated the first 10 minutes of the second half, but chances have been few and far between as they struggle to create scoring opportunities. 54 min: Excellent from Todd Cantwell, who tracks back to dispossess Cesar Azpilicueta in a dangerous position on the right flank. 52 min: There\u2019s a break in play as Marco Stiepermann receives treatment for an injury to his hand sustained in a robust coming-together with Kurt Zouma. 50 min: Norwich fans have just spent the 49th minute applauding in a tribute to David Powell, one of their number who recently died in a car accident. 49 min: A Jorginho shot from distance takes a deflection and goes out for a corner. Mason Mount swings the ball into the mixer, where Azpilicueta gets in front of Ben Godfrey and flicks a header over the bar. 47 min: Jamal Lewis intercepts a Cesar Azpilicueta pass, but Norwich lose possession again. With Lewis in possession, the ball\u2019s played to Chrsitian Pulisic, who opts not to square the ball for Tammy Abraham and fires wide from a tight angle instead. Abraham is understandably unhappy with his team-mate. Norwich\u2019s defending in the early stages of this second half has been slapstick. 46 min: Norwich get the second half started, with no changes in personnel on either side. Here\u2019s hoping for a second half that\u2019s just as entertaining as the first. Mason Mount drags an early shot wide after Ross Barkley steals possession in the Norwich half. Peep! Both sides go in for the break after a massively entertaining first half. Tammy Abraham opened toe scoring for Chelsea, only to have his effort cancelled out just over two minutes later by Todd Cantwell. Chelsea went ahead again through Mason Mount, only for Teemu Pukki to restore parity with his fifth goal in three Premier League games. Both sides have looked great going forward, but rather kamikaze at the back. There\u2019ll be more goals in this game - mark my words. 45+1 min: Norwich gallop upfield on the counter-attack from the corner. The ball\u2019s played upfield for Teemu Pukki to chase, but Kepa reads the situation well and is quick out of his penalty area to clear the ball and the danger. 45 min: Jamal Lewis makes a crucial block from Christian Pulisic, who controlled a pass into the Norwich penalty area beautifully before unleashing a shot from about seven yards out. Corner for Chelsea. 44 min: Marco Stipermann is booked for a challenge on Jorginho in which he appeared to win the ball. I suppose it makes up for the card he avoided earlier. 43 min: Grant Hanley tries to pick out Todd Cantwell with a long ball up the pitch. his attempt to sprint in behind the Chelsea defence is thwarted by Kurt Zouma. 41 min: Moritz Leitner puts the ball out of play for a Chelsea throw-in deep in Norwich territory, dispossessing Mason Mount in the process. 38 min: With options to his left and right, Ross Barkley tries a shot from the edge of the Norwich penalty area. The ball takes a deflection, loops up in the air and drops for Christian Pulisic on the byline. He\u2019s unable to control it under pressure from Grant Hanley and puts it out for a goal-kick. 34 min: It\u2019s one from the training ground, as Stiepermann touches the ball to Buendia, who advances several strides closer to goal before unleashing a shot. Kepa parries his effort and the ball drops to Grant Hanley. He shoots the rebound straight at the goalkeeper. A let-off for Chelsea, who are almost as bad in defence as their opponents. 34 min: Jorginho is booked for a late lunge on Emi Buendia. Norwich City have a free-kick wide on the right. 31 min: Teemu Pukki gets goal side of Kurt Zouma, just about staying onside to get on a wonderful defence-splitting through ball from Buendia. From a tight angle, he hits a low diagonal shot goalwards. Kepa gets a decent touch on it but is unable to prevent the ball slowly rolling over the line. It\u2019s a good finish from the Finn, but Chelsea\u2019s goalkeeper should have kept it out. Teemu!!! Norwich restore parity again, with Teemu Puki scoring his fifth goal in three games. 28 min: Ben Godfrey is forced to dive in with a good challenge in his own penalty area, denying Jorginho a shooting opportunity just as the Brazilian was about to pull the trigger. Chelsea are getting into that Norwich penalty area way too easily. As impressive as they are going forward, Norwich are very poor defensively. 27 min: Chelsea win another free-kick, which Emerson wastes. In a good position to get a decent cross into the Norwich penalty area, he curls the ball straight out of play for a goal kick. 25 min: Chelsea win a corner, which is taken short from Mount to Barkley. The ball is crossed into the penalty area from the left, where Stiepermann loses Andreas Christensen. The Chelsea central defender stoop to head goalwards, but Tim Krul saves brilliantly, turning his effort away. 24 min: Norwich are forced to scramble the ball clear from their own penalty area, as Tammy Abraham and Mason Mount try to create an opening. 23 min: Christian Pulisic takes the ball past Ben Godfrey to get in a good position on the right side of the penalty area, only to slip before he can get a cross in. Norwich clear their lines. 21 min: Emerson Palmieri tries a pot-shot that\u2019s blocked by Grant Hanley. 18 min: Norwich try to play the ball out from the back, but get caught out. A rogue pass is picked up by Christian Pulisic halfway inside the Norwich half. He plays the ball to Barkley, who picks out Mount with a clever ball. The midfielder gallops into space in the Norwich penalty area before thumping the ball past Tim Krul into the bottom right-hand corner. Chelsea retake the lead, with Mason Mount scoring his second goal in as many games. 15 min: Marco Stiepermann cynically hauls down Mateo Kovacic as he galloped towards the Norwich penalty area. Remarkably,m the Norwich midfielder escapes a booking, but Chelsea have a free-kick from about 35 yards out, in the inside right channel. Mason Mount swings the ball into the penalty area, where Stiepermann puts it out for a corner. Nothing comes of it. 13 min: Mason Mount attacks down the left flank for Chelsea, galloping into space left by Max Aarons, who lost the ball further up the field. The ball\u2019s sent into the penalty area, where Grant Hanley heads clear. Chelsea attack the Norwich penalty area again, but Max Aarons is back in position to intercept and clear. 12 min: Early possession stats: Norwich 66%-34% Chelsea. 10 min: Jamal Lewis tries to release Teemu Pukki with a pass in behind Chelsea\u2019s high defensive line. Andreas Christensen makes a crucial interception. 9 min: Norwich go forward again, with Jamal Lewis on the ball down the left flank. Mateo Kovacic does well to track back and relieve him of possession. 7 min: Outstanding against Newcastle last week, Todd Cantwell scores his first Premier League goal to level proceedings. Norwich scythed through the Chelsea defence, with Teemu Pukki finding himself in possession on the left side of the six yard box. He could have tried a shot, but unselfishly opted to square the ball instead. Bursting between defenders, Cantwell was on hand to fire home low and hard from five yards out. And the home side equalises with a superbly worked goal. 5 min: A perfect start for Chelsea. They worked the ball cross-field from left flank to right, where Christian Pulisic held it up. Azpilicueta charged up his outside on the overlap, before looping in a cross from the right. Unmarked in the penalty area, Tammy Abraham took a touch to control it before slotting home. Chelsea take the lead. Tammy Abraham scores his first goal for the club, getting on the end of a cross from Cesar Azpilicueta to slot home from about eight yards out. 3 min: Mason Mount takes a poor touch and lunges in on Marco Stiepermann. Free-kick for Norwich near the halfway line. 2 min: Norwich pass the ball around deep inside their own half, before getting it towards the halfway line and losing possession. They get it back again, as the games begins tentatively. 1 min: Chelsea get the ball rolling, working it back towards goalkeeper Kepa, who gets an early touch. Not long now: The teams line up in the narrow tunnel and make their way out on to the pitch. Norwich\u2019s players wear their customary home kit of canary yellow and green shirts, green shorts and yellow socks. Chelsea\u2019s players wear white shirts and shorts, with blue socks. A late change for Chelsea: Pedro has injured his hamstring in the warm-up and will not play. Ross Barkley has been drafted in to replace him. Frank Lampard speaks: \u201cI certainly took in the appreciation from the fans,\u201d he tells Jake Humphrey, in an interview recorded earlier this week. \u201cI loved it and was very proud of it,\u201d he says of the welcome he got from Chelsea fans at his first home game in charge. \u201cI\u2019m in work mode and don\u2019t get too caught up in the emotion, because I\u2019m too focussed.\u201d On his management style: |I try to be myself because I always felt as a player that I didn\u2019t buy into managers who were trying to portray a certain personality,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t have love every day. You can\u2019t have toughness every day. You have to flip between them and try to find a balance.\u201d An email: \u201cAs a Chelsea fan it pains me to say it, but with Kante out injured and current form of both teams, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Norwich nick the three points,\u201d writes Tom Noble from Stockholm. \u201cEven if Kante was fit, Jorginho tends to expose our shaky defence, especially against players like Pukki. I\u2019m not his biggest fan but also quite surprised that Barkley hasn\u2019t been given a proper chance yet. Oh well, here we go.\u201d I am inclined to agree with you Tom and would have fancied Norwich for this one, even with Kante in the side. Without him, I can see Chelsea\u2019s midfield being over-run, much like they were at times against Manchester United and Leicester. We shall see. Team news: Christian Pulisic and Tammy Abraham start for Chelsea, who will have to make do without N\u2019Golo Kante this afternoon. For Norwich, |Daniel Farke fields the same team that performed so well against Newcastle last weekend. Norwich: Krul, Aarons, Hanley, Godfrey, Lewis, Leitner, Trybull, Cantwell, Stiepermann, Emi, Pukki. Subs: Byram, Vrancic, Klose, Fahrmann, McLean, Tettey, Srbeny.

      "body": "<p>When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/judith-grisel\" title=\"\">Professor Judith Grisel</a> sat down to write her book <em>Never Enough</em> (a guide to the neuroscience of addiction that has been her life\u2019s work), she didn\u2019t expect to share so much of her own story. Nevertheless the resulting chapters are a collision of the personal and professional, detailing the deep links between her work life and the decade of drug and alcohol addiction that almost destroyed her.</p> <p>On paper, Grisel was an unlikely candidate for going off the rails. One of three children, she describes a privileged upbringing in a progressive, suburban area of New Jersey. With an airline pilot father and a mother who was a registered nurse, Grisel remembers growing up in a \u201cperfect-looking family\u201d.</p> <p>As her research would go on to help demonstrate, there was no single factor that predicted her drug problems. Neuroscientists have found a complex blend of nature and nurture at work in addictive tendencies and their research shows that many genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors work together in complex ways that often remain elusive.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>At just 13, I found alcohol. It was the first time I felt relaxed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d is the question that underpins much of Grisel\u2019s research, and she continues to wonder why friends who drank heavily with her in high school were spared addiction. In <em>Never Enough</em> she offers a smorgasbord of theories behind her own and others\u2019 predisposition to addiction: an \u201cextreme\u201d personality and love of risk-taking, trying drugs at a young age, lower levels of endorphins in the brain, potential hypersensitivity to the neurological rewards of drugs alongside, more surprisingly, her own parents\u2019 strict response to her behaviour.</p> <p>\u201cIf they had just been a little more lax, if I hadn\u2019t been the first child, I probably could have been normal,\u201d she reflects. Grisel did not experience the childhood poverty, insecure housing or abuse we have come (rightly) to associate with some drug users\u2019 histories. Instead she believes the misery within her parents\u2019 relationship and the pressure she felt to keep up appearances had the greatest impact on her trajectory. \u201cTheir marriage was so dysfunctional that my mother eventually got an annulment from the Pope but we never acknowledged it at the time. As a kid I felt like a prop in this play of the perfect family.\u201d</p> <p>A pivotal moment came when, aged nine or 10, Grisel found her mother crying at the kitchen sink. \u201cI asked her what the matter was and she answered that she was crying because she was so happy. My stomach sank a thousand feet because I knew it wasn\u2019t true but I also knew there was no way to reach the truth.\u201d Her mother\u2019s insistence that the family ignored the reality of their problems and instead went along with a pretence of happiness had a profound and negative impact on the way Grisel herself came to understand her own emotions and place in the world.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I learned to do in that moment,\u201d she explains, \u201cwas to doubt my reality; to realise that what was critical in life was the story, the veneer. And that felt like dying.\u201d</p> <p>So began Grisel\u2019s search for a way to escape her everyday life, a life that felt false and full of pressure to go along with the pretence, and instead to find a way to feel something that felt like the truth. It started with an obsession with reading books, \u201cI would read constantly, upside down if I had to,\u201d and then aged 13 (reaching a key developmental point when the teenage brain is primed for risky behaviour) she had her first drink. \u201cI thought, this is how people get through life. I can pretend all this stuff, because I can have this little secret where I\u2019m nice and warm inside,\u201d remembers Grisel. \u201cIt was the first time in my life I remember feeling relaxed.\u201d</p> <p>Grisel swiftly progressed to the \u201csolace\u201d of daily drinking, smoking marijuana and regular drug use. \u201cI loved being able to connect to my true self and I only seemed to be able to do that when I was wasted,\u201d she explains. Unsurprisingly, she was soon in trouble at home and school, trouble that escalated through her teenage years until she was \u201ckicked out\u201d by her parents when she was 19 \u2013 dropping out of her first year of college at the same time. After years of trying a range of ways to stop Grisel taking drugs her family now withdrew financial support entirely. As she left home, despite her \u201cbrawny high school football player brother\u201d crying in the street, she felt exhilarated: \u201cI felt like all the restraints were off and things got very bad after that.\u201d</p> <p>Increasingly detached from her parents, who she barely saw over the next four years, Grisel\u2019s life became entirely focused on drugs. \u201cI was scraping by on nothing but lies and evasion and my only priority was staying loaded.\u201d Now injecting cocaine, her dedication to the next hit led to frequent homelessness and unemployment. When she did find work she stole from the till, she regularly took credit cards from strangers and ruthlessly stole money and drugs from friends. Soon she was \u201cfacing lunatic dealers and DEA agents\u201d with a single-minded determination that she also credits with her subsequent scientific tenacity.</p> <p>The depravity of Grisel\u2019s addicted life, described in the memoir chapters of <em>Never Enough</em>, illustrates the vicious cycle of the \u201cA and B process\u201d she explains in the scientific sections of her book. When humans engage in any mind-altering activity, the effects are known as the \u201cA process\u201d. Whether it\u2019s the sedation of alcohol or the rush of cocaine, users often feel pleasure from the initial use of their drug of choice. But as Grisel is at pains to explain, \u201cThere is no free lunch.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It didn\u2019t matter how high I got, I was stuck with myself</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She believes people might make better choices if normal brain function was more widely appreciated. \u201cThe brain adapts to any addictive substance or activity by producing the exact opposite effect,\u201d says Grisel. This opposite state, known as the \u201cB process\u201d, is led by the brain\u2019s drive to return to its baseline state \u2013 and it\u2019s why hangovers and comedowns are such unpleasant experiences. Our brains are so efficient at returning to normal that with regular use we need more and more of the drug or activity to feel the \u201cA process\u201d and the oppositional \u201cB process\u201d kicks in almost instantaneously. Soon, as Grisel herself experienced, we need the drug just to feel normal and without it we only feel the negative impact of the \u201cB process\u201d.</p> <p>With addiction rates rising steeply, helping people avoid being imprisoned in this cycle is a priority for many worried parents, case-workers, researchers and Grisel herself. But, just as a simple set of causes of addiction doesn\u2019t seem to exist, there doesn\u2019t appear to be a magic recipe for recovery either. Grisel describes her own transformation from addict to sober scientist as a collection of coincidences and luck. \u201cI was inexplicably fortunate. I think I was carried through by circumstance,\u201d she says.</p> <p>A lucky break led to better housing and a move away from injecting cocaine. After a \u201cterrifying encounter\u201d with her reflection in the mirror, the final push she needed to start her recovery came from her parents. In a crucial moment of compassion from her father, he told her he wished only happiness for her life and the 23-year-old finally realised just how unhappy she was. </p> <p>A drug-treatment facility in Minnesota was followed by a three-month stay in a women\u2019s halfway house and then Grisel began to repair her life. A key motivation for staying sober was her determination to find a cure for addiction. At the beginning of her career, Grisel and others in her field were convinced they would swiftly find that cure, but as neuroscientific understanding has deepened it has revealed just how much we don\u2019t understand. \u201cIn the book,\u201d Grisel reflects, \u201cI was shocked that I couldn\u2019t say that neuroscience is making great strides. It didn\u2019t seem true to me.\u201d</p> <p>Though she can\u2019t yet offer a magic switch to turn off addiction, She now believes much of the answer lies not in manipulating DNA but in encouraging human love, compassion and connection. With more high-potency drugs available more widely than ever before, alongside a sea of addictive technology enticing adults and children to \u201cfritter away our lives checking updates just like users fritter away their lives snorting cocaine\u201d, Grisel believes we need a range of tactics to tackle the global problem of addiction. \u201cThe people right next to us are an obvious place to start,\u201d she adds. \u201cHuman relationships and connections are the low-hanging fruit.\u201d</p> <p>With her own 16-year-old daughter and grown-up stepsons she and her husband have prioritised staying emotionally connected to their children and, when they are worried about behaviour, sharing their own feelings rather than telling their children what to do. \u201cI will say, \u2018I love you and I\u2019m really concerned about this. If you need help, I will give it to you,\u2019\u201d Grisel says. \u201cBut I will also be clear that I am not going to enable the behaviour.\u201d Despite choosing to parent differently from the way that she was brought up, Grisel now reflects on her parents with compassion, believing that if you have a child who is an addict, \u201cIt\u2019s an almost impossible situation to be in and very hard to know what to do.\u201d</p> <p>Decades of research and experience have led Judith Grisel to believe that the dominance of addictive substances and activities in contemporary life are leading society to the brink of an addictive black hole and that it is only by connecting with each other that we can avoid being sucked in. \u201cRight now we\u2019re in a rising phase of escapism and pharmacology \u2013 this epidemic of addiction is really an epidemic of avoidance. Above all we need better ways to cope with life and to be present to our experiences.\u201d Despite her concerns, she does have hope. \u201cUltimately you can\u2019t avoid yourself. It didn\u2019t matter how high I got, I was stuck with myself. I think we\u2019re soon going to get to that point as a society and then we might finally have our moment of truth.\u201d Then, Grisel believes, we\u2019ll discover that the way out of addiction was actually inside us all along.</p> <p><em>Never Enough: the Neuroscience and Experience of Addiction by Judith Grisel is published by Scribe</em><em>, priced \u00a39.99.

Dead Babies (1975) Amis\u2019s second novel sought to shock with its drugs, violence and (mostly \u201ccancelled\u201d) sex among a group of repellent hedonists who reject humane values as \u201cdead babies\u201d. Inside there\u2019s an attempt at murder mystery and a Menippean satire on society\u2019s progress and the limits of liberation, but it\u2019s drowned out by a chaotic structure and the stink of the male characters\u2019 misogyny. Typical line \u201cKeith Whitehead lay on sandpaper blankets farting like a wizard.\u201d Amis tropes Height, Keith, sex, teeth 12. Lionel Asbo (2012) The best to be said about this book is that Amis clearly had fun writing it. But his style now is harder than it used to be, with less give, and this blunt comedy about a lottery-winning yob, vindaloo-eating dogs (\u201cyou never give them the Tabasco!\u201d), 25-year-old grannies and a cast from a Channel 5 shockumentary feels sour, especially as written by a man in a Brooklyn brownstone and subtitled (yes!)

      "body": "<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this a hoax?\u201d asks a news reporter. This is the question at the heart of Penny Lane\u2019s <em>(</em><em>Nuts!</em>, <em>Our Nixon</em>) impish documentary about the Satanic Temple. Founded in 2013, the group claim to \u201crefine\u201d satanism \u201cas a weapon in the ongoing culture wars\u201d, positioning themselves as a counterbalancing force against evangelical Christianity and the pernicious conflation of church and state.</p> <p>\u201cI used to be a zesty little atheist,\u201d smirks a new believer. But being an atheist is boring, he insists. There\u2019s no community, no code of ethics. Indeed, the community Lane zeroes in on is one of charming, articulate oddballs; with his glass eye and reasonable baritone, co-founder Lucien Greaves, in particular, is a charismatic antihero.</p> <p>Though she takes her subjects seriously, Lane allows herself to be led by her sense of humour. A statue of a 10ft goat-headed demon \u2013 a monument to Satan, set to reside next to the Ten Commandments monument in Little Rock, Arkansas \u2013 is a provocative middle finger to the widespread acceptance of religious iconography. An anti-anti-abortion rally that sees the satanists dress as fetish-inspired adult babies is even funnier. \u201cThe meaning is a bit lost on us,\u201d says an innocent passer-by. It\u2019s no accident that Lane titles her film <em>Hail Satan?</em>, opting for a curious question mark rather than an ecstatic exclamation point. Though the film mostly makes a persuasive case for the Temple\u2019s legitimacy and its leftist values of science, tolerance and pluralism, you suspect she remains unconverted.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_i6hRw4zR8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/z_i6hRw4zR8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_i6hRw4zR8\">Watch the trailer for Hail Satan?</a></figcaption> </figure>",

      "bodyText": "\u201cIsn\u2019t this a hoax?\u201d asks a news reporter. This is the question at the heart of Penny Lane\u2019s (Nuts!, Our Nixon) impish documentary about the Satanic Temple. Founded in 2013, the group claim to \u201crefine\u201d satanism \u201cas a weapon in the ongoing culture wars\u201d, positioning themselves as a counterbalancing force against evangelical Christianity and the pernicious conflation of church and state. \u201cI used to be a zesty little atheist,\u201d smirks a new believer. But being an atheist is boring, he insists. There\u2019s no community, no code of ethics. Indeed, the community Lane zeroes in on is one of charming, articulate oddballs; with his glass eye and reasonable baritone, co-founder Lucien Greaves, in particular, is a charismatic antihero. Though she takes her subjects seriously, Lane allows herself to be led by her sense of humour. A statue of a 10ft goat-headed demon \u2013 a monument to Satan, set to reside next to the Ten Commandments monument in Little Rock, Arkansas \u2013 is a provocative middle finger to the widespread acceptance of religious iconography. An anti-anti-abortion rally that sees the satanists dress as fetish-inspired adult babies is even funnier. \u201cThe meaning is a bit lost on us,\u201d says an innocent passer-by. It\u2019s no accident that Lane titles her film Hail Satan?, opting for a curious question mark rather than an ecstatic exclamation point. Though the film mostly makes a persuasive case for the Temple\u2019s legitimacy and its leftist values of science, tolerance and pluralism, you suspect she remains unconverted.",

Their lives have been affected by violence again and again. A third of the population are children. And yet, according to Damascus and its Russian and Iranian allies, they are all jihadist-allied terrorists. With the Turkish border closed to refugees, there is nowhere left for them to go.</p> <p>\u201cThe regime and Russia push the \u2018terrorist\u2019 narrative for a very simple reason: they genuinely believe it. For years now, Idlib has been the dumping ground for irreconcilable fighters and civilians, all of whom, for whatever reason, refused to consider a life in regime-held territories,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.mei.edu/experts/charles-lister\" title=\"\">Charles Lister</a>, director of the Countering Terrorism and Extremism programme at the Washington-based Middle East Institute.</p> <p>Jihadist groups had a presence in Idlib even before Syria\u2019s civil war broke out. During the conflict their growth has been motivated by many factors, including the relentless savagery of the regime in the battles for Aleppo, Deraa, Homs and Ghouta.</p> <p>A fragile ceasefire in Idlib brokered by Russia and Turkey fell apart after Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a jihadist umbrella group that grew out of al-Qaida\u2019s Syrian affiliate, wrested control of the province from the Turkish-backed moderate National Liberation Front (NLF) in January.</p> <p>Civilians in some places have had to abide by HTS\u2019s rules and, in May, the NLF was forced into an alliance with HTS to fend off the current regime assault. Estimates of HTS\u2019s strength vary from about 15,000 to 30,000 fighters.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It's clear now that there is no cruelty the Assad regime could inflict that could trigger meaningful international action</p> <footer> <cite>Tobias Schneider, analyst</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The area has been under sustained air and ground attack for four months and the civilian cost has been brutal. About 500,000 people have fled their homes, many to camp out on the Turkish border. At least 45 schools and 42 health clinics have been targeted by violence, according to the International Rescue Committee, as well as bakeries and marketplaces. At least 881 civilians and more than 2,000 rebel combatants have died, along with 1,400 pro-Assad troops.</p> <p>If Assad, blocked by Turkey, struggles to retake Idlib from HTS, the options for those inside the province remain bleak. Fears are growing that the area could become another Gaza Strip \u2013 sealed off from the outside world and ruled by an unpopular, repressive militant group.</p> <p>The international community, however, has largely stood by and watched as the predictable crisis in Idlib has unfolded.</p> <p>\u201cThe Assad regime has understood that, in the western imagination, the fear of terrorist attacks always supersedes humanitarian concerns. For years, the international community sat on the sidelines of the Syrian conflict as the regime methodically suppressed all civic opposition and depopulated swathes of supposedly oppositionist territory.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/08/archive-zip/giv-39022PKxqgWszA8k/\" > <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/08/archive-zip/giv-39022PKxqgWszA8k/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cAfter eight years of war, it has become clear that there is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/11/great-powers-wars-nationalist-strongmen-syria-libya\" title=\"\">no cruelty the Assad regime could inflict that could trigger meaningful international action</a>,\u201d says Tobias Schneider, a research fellow at the Global Public Policy Institute in Berlin.</p> <p>For Dimashqi, home and her dreams for a future in 2011, now feel far away. \u201cThe revolution was great in the beginning,\u201d she said. \u201cWe took to the streets demanding freedom.

With the Turkish border closed to refugees, there is nowhere left for them to go. \u201cThe regime and Russia push the \u2018terrorist\u2019 narrative for a very simple reason: they genuinely believe it. For years now, Idlib has been the dumping ground for irreconcilable fighters and civilians, all of whom, for whatever reason, refused to consider a life in regime-held territories,\u201d says Charles Lister, director of the Countering Terrorism and Extremism programme at the Washington-based Middle East Institute. Jihadist groups had a presence in Idlib even before Syria\u2019s civil war broke out. During the conflict their growth has been motivated by many factors, including the relentless savagery of the regime in the battles for Aleppo, Deraa, Homs and Ghouta. A fragile ceasefire in Idlib brokered by Russia and Turkey fell apart after Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a jihadist umbrella group that grew out of al-Qaida\u2019s Syrian affiliate, wrested control of the province from the Turkish-backed moderate National Liberation Front (NLF) in January. Civilians in some places have had to abide by HTS\u2019s rules and, in May, the NLF was forced into an alliance with HTS to fend off the current regime assault. Estimates of HTS\u2019s strength vary from about 15,000 to 30,000 fighters. The area has been under sustained air and ground attack for four months and the civilian cost has been brutal. About 500,000 people have fled their homes, many to camp out on the Turkish border. At least 45 schools and 42 health clinics have been targeted by violence, according to the International Rescue Committee, as well as bakeries and marketplaces. At least 881 civilians and more than 2,000 rebel combatants have died, along with 1,400 pro-Assad troops. If Assad, blocked by Turkey, struggles to retake Idlib from HTS, the options for those inside the province remain bleak. Fears are growing that the area could become another Gaza Strip \u2013 sealed off from the outside world and ruled by an unpopular, repressive militant group. The international community, however, has largely stood by and watched as the predictable crisis in Idlib has unfolded. \u201cThe Assad regime has understood that, in the western imagination, the fear of terrorist attacks always supersedes humanitarian concerns. For years, the international community sat on the sidelines of the Syrian conflict as the regime methodically suppressed all civic opposition and depopulated swathes of supposedly oppositionist territory. \u201cAfter eight years of war, it has become clear that there is no cruelty the Assad regime could inflict that could trigger meaningful international action,\u201d says Tobias Schneider, a research fellow at the Global Public Policy Institute in Berlin. For Dimashqi, home and her dreams for a future in 2011, now feel far away. \u201cThe revolution was great in the beginning,\u201d she said. \u201cWe took to the streets demanding freedom. I wanted to be a nurse in the Free Syrian Army. I encouraged my husband and children to go out and protest, to join the FSA to defend innocents against the regime. \u201cSo much has changed since then. I lost my beloved Saleem and his father. I lost my home. I\u2019m far away from my sister in Ghouta. The war is not over. But I feel like I am already defeated.\u201d",

Opposition fighters withdrew last week from the key town of Khan Sheikhoun, another strategic concession to Assad and his Russian and Iranian backers, who have torn up a ceasefire deal protecting the rebels\u2019 last major pocket of territory. As the country\u2019s bloody civil war grinds into its ninth year, Assad is widely acknowledged to have emerged triumphant. But the fighting is far from over, with the terms of victory and the shape of Syria\u2019s future still very much in play on the battlefield. Armed groups are dug in across much of the north, including extremist opposition fighters in Idlib, and beyond them foreign-backed fighters including Turkish proxy militias and US-backed Kurds along sections of the border with Turkey and Iraq. Caught in the middle of the fighting, as brutal as it ever has been during this conflict, are desperate civilians. Around three million are trapped in the opposition-held province of Idlib. The area is largely controlled by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a former al-Qaida affiliate that came to dominate the opposition after infighting and fragmentation destroyed more moderate groups. But the civilians gathered there come from a much broader range of backgrounds, many of them opposition supporters displaced multiple times from areas that have since fallen to Assad, including Aleppo and the Damascus suburb of Ghouta. Many have fallen under HTS control without actively supporting them. The latest crisis was set in motion in April, when the Syrian government offensive shredded a truce that was agreed last year between Turkey, Iran and Russia. It had created a buffer zone between the last remaining pockets of rebel-held territory and Assad\u2019s forces. The scale and intensity of the bombardment that followed, including attacks on health facilities and schools, led the United Nations to launch an inquiry.

But Turkey too is under extreme political pressure to keep Idlib free of Assad\u2019s control, both for strategic reasons, and because of fear about the three million people clustering ever closer to its border. It already hosts more than 3.6 million refugees, who have become a political liability; authorities are trying to close refugee camps and send some of them home. Turkey would struggle to deal with a fresh influx but it fears increasing pressure to open its borders if Syrian government forces close in further on civilians gathered on the other side.Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, will host his Russian and Iranian counterparts for a summit on Syria next month, he announced on Thursday. They will discuss Idlib, but also political efforts to end the war.",

Asked when Britain would put forward detailed plans for avoiding a hard border, Johnson said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been very clear that we won\u2019t be instituting any kinds of checks or controls at the Northern Irish border; we don\u2019t think that any such controls are necessary. \u201cThere are a large range of alternative arrangements, with which you\u2019ll be familiar. We\u2019ll be discussing those with our friends in the coming weeks,\u201d he said. Earlier on Saturday, Tusk told a press conference the EU was prepared to examine concrete proposals from the UK, but also asked whether Johnson wanted to \u201cgo down in history as Mr No Deal\u201d. The European council president has previously said there is a \u201cspecial place in hell\u201d for people who argued for Brexit without a plan for carrying it out, a remark widely read at the time as being directed at Johnson, among others. Asked about the remark on Saturday, Johnson said: \u201cI have great relations with our friends and partners in the EU, and intend to improve them the whole time, without getting into any post-Brexit eschatology.\u201d Downing Street hopes the meeting with Tusk will be constructive enough to help Johnson convince potential Tory rebels that a deal remains within reach. Johnson must navigate a treacherous fortnight in early September when MPs return to Westminster after the summer recess, with Labour threatening to table a vote of no confidence in his fragile government. Conservatives determined to prevent a no-deal Brexit may be prepared to stay their hand if the signals from EU capitals are sufficiently encouraging \u2013 though they fear Johnson\u2019s demand that the backstop be removed from the withdrawal agreement makes it impossible to reach a deal by the 31 October deadline. In a summit that will mark his first formal outing on the world stage, Johnson will underline Britain\u2019s determination to remain outward-looking and multilateralist after Brexit \u2013 and try to burnish his credentials as an international statesman. His meeting with Trump will be their first talks face-to-face, though the pair have already spoken repeatedly on the phone.",

Now that is something worth celebrating. And what better way to celebrate than to dive headlong into our live blog of the 3rd Test at Headingley, where England set off in pursuit of an unlikely Ashes-saving victory.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/aug/24/ashes-2019-england-v-australia-third-test-day-three-live-cricket\">Ashes 2019: England chasing 359 v Australia, third Test day three \u2013\u00a0live!</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d6130228f08a0805bcc3b89\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-24T12:48:41.821Z\">1.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">AFL: West Coast 9.13 (67) lost to Hawthorn 16.9 (105)</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>That didn\u2019t go to plan for West Coast, now did it?

OK, it was only an exhibition game, but when you consider droughts this arid, in a sport so completely dominated by one nation, thoughts wander back to a certain boat race back in 1983. If you\u2019re unfortunate enough to have to work tomorrow, call your boss and tell said boss you\u2019re not coming in. If said boss sacks you, tell said boss I think said boss is a bum.</p> <p>Anyway, moving on, we have a pivotal game in the <strong>AFL</strong> on our evening agenda, with West Coast hosting Hawthorn in a tussle that could well have ramifications on the top four and top eight. Gold Coast and Greater Western Sydney will also be kicking around a Sherrin, the Dragons and the Roosters will battle it out in the <strong>NRL</strong>, the Lightning host the Thunderbirds in <strong>Super Netball</strong> \u2026 and there is a game of <strong>cricket</strong> going on in England, or so I\u2019m told.</p> <p>But I don\u2019t want to do this solo.

Today\u2019s episode was followed by an interview by another national treasure, the piercingly insightful, Stan Grant. His story was about one of our greatest champions Adam Goodes. </p> <p> He was of course promoting the new film The Australian Dream. In his usual wonderful erudite fashion managed to capture the harm, we all did, when we humiliated our Aboriginal brothers and sisters as we booed Adam out of the game Stan explains that the film is the story of us, our story of Australia. A failure to reconcile ourselves with our history, a failure to tell our story of our history. It is a story of Aboriginal Australians telling their story, with their voices, their truth, how they see their country - a voice talking back from black Australia.</p> <p>I thought of these words today as the Swans took to the field and the great Buddy Franklin played his 300th game. There was even talk today the Adam who, to all our eternal shame, has turned away from the game, might come to watch as his beloved Swans celebrate another of their great Aboriginal players. I\u2019m so made up they won. They are the only club that can hold their head up in this story. Have no doubt, this a permanent stain on our game. </p> <p>There will be some who hope the story moves on quickly to concentrate on finals. Even that has a familiar sad ring to it. The same ones I suspect that Adam feels missed the opportunity to address their shame. Who knows, maybe one day these small and divisive characters, with their tricky words and powerful friends, will be immortalised in a serious Coodabeens Champions ditty, saved for the irredeemable, that speaks to the irrevocable harm they have done to our game and our story.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d60f5218f08a0805bcc3a18\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-24T08:30:15.127Z\">9.30am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Concussion in sport: </strong>I had some thoughts this week on the way Australia makes heroes of the walking wounded who battle through games to victory.

With the Giants sitting in fourth, just one bonus point ahead of the Collingwood Magpies, a win with all four bonus points would mean they secure the last spot in the finals. However, a win with three or less bonus points opens the door for the Magpies to swoop in (see what I did there) and knock the Giants down to fifth.

      "bodyText": "A compelling evening of sport headlined by Hawthorn\u2019s dismantling of West Coast in Perth. The match certainly didn\u2019t go to script for the Eagles, who now need Brisbane to beat Richmond on Sunday in order to finish in the top four, but underlined Hawthorn\u2019s rich vein of form and the brilliance of their coach, Alastair Clarkson. Elsewhere, Giants sharp shooter Jeremy Cameron all but secured his first Coleman Medal with a nine-goal haul against the hapless Suns, in the NRL the Roosters blew the Dragons away in the first half en route to a 22-point win and the Lightning were far too good for the Thunderbirds in Super Netball. Oh, and in basketball the Boomers beat Team USA for the very first time. Now that is something worth celebrating. And what better way to celebrate than to dive headlong into our live blog of the 3rd Test at Headingley, where England set off in pursuit of an unlikely Ashes-saving victory. That didn\u2019t go to plan for West Coast, now did it? The Hawks outworked, outsmarted and outplayed their hosts to keep their finals hopes alive and the Eagles\u2019 top-four chances hanging by a thread. This 38-point drubbing relegates West Coast to fifth spot, and there they will stay if Richmond beat Brisbane tomorrow at the MCG. A grand way for Isaac Smith to celebrate his 200th game, no sort of way for West Coast to gear up for September. 20CharactersNoSpaces feels I am discounting England\u2019s chances of winning the 3rd Test: Here\u2019s what I said: \u201cEngland have been set 359 to win the 3rd Test and prevent Australia from retaining the Ashes. Good luck with that. Labuschagne\u2019s 80 was a high point in Australia\u2019s second dig - and 13 more than England\u2019s entire team could muster yesterday.\u201d Here\u2019s what 20CNS said: \u201cThis strikes me as being dangerously close to premature triumphalism, Scott. Yes, Making 360 in a 4th innings is unlikely. But we all know it\u2019s been done before, and to Australia. I\u2019m not going to be feeling confident until we\u2019ve got Stokes out.\u201d I see where you\u2019re coming from, 20CNS, but I\u2019m not feeling in the slightest bit triumphant (prematurely or otherwise). Yes, England have a shot but my sardonic \u2018Good luck with that\u2019 comment merely reflects how unlikely they are to achieve their goal. And though possible, it is extremely unlikely. AFL: Q4: 12 mins remaining: West Coast 9.11 (65) vs Hawthorn 14.8 (92) - the Hawks are piling on the goals against an Eagles outfit that has run out of puff. Percentage is now becoming an issue with the margin blowing out, though quick goals to Liam Ryan and Willie Rioli to interrupt three straight in this term to Hawthorn releases the pressure somewhat. Jeremy Cameron heads into this dead-ish rubber six goals behind Ben Brown in the race for the Coleman Medal - but boots an amazing 9.5 to be crowned the AFL\u2019s leading goal kicker for the first time in his career. The Giants, as we knew, will host an elimination final while the Suns will endure another off-season of hand-wringing and introspection. Not that Michael Rischitelli will be part of that. Good job, Michael, good job. AFL: 3QT: West Coast 7.11 (53) vs Hawthorn 11.6 (72) - a late James Sicily major really takes the wind out of West Coast, who for parts of the third quarter were the better team but in the end had nothing to show for it. As it stands, the Eagles\u2019 grip on the top four is out of their hands and Hawthorn\u2019s season isn\u2019t over just yet. AFL: Q3: 5 mins remaining: West Coast 7.9 (51) vs Hawthorn 10.6 (66) - the Eagles have had marginally the better of the third term but a mark and a goal inside-50 to Tim O\u2019Brien has cemented Hawthorn\u2019s lead. Nice bit of biffo from Rioli here. Cricket: England have been set 359 to win the 3rd Test and prevent Australia from retaining the Ashes. Good luck with that. Labuschagne\u2019s 80 was a high point in Australia\u2019s second dig - and 13 more than England\u2019s entire team could muster yesterday. AFL: 3QT: Gold Coast 5.12 (42) vs Greater Western Sydney 16.5 (101) - Jeremy Cameron boots his seventh goal to overtake Ben Brown and claim the outright lead in the Coleman Medal. Go Jezza. Oh, and the Giants are pasting the Suns. The tale of two expansion clubs, indeed. Well, at least the Dragons won the second half. The Roosters, however, win the game and solidify their position in the top four. The damage was done in the first half with Cooper Cronk putting on a masterclass. AFL: HT: West Coast 5.8 (38) vs Hawthorn 8.6 (54) - Ricky Henderson\u2019s long-range major on the siren caps a five-goal-to-one quarter for the Hawks, who as it stands have nudged their way into the eight. Not sure about West Coast\u2019s taste for the contest in that quarter. Yes, their place in September is secure but the double chance is still well and truly up for grabs. Henderson is firing for the Hawks while Andrew Gaff is leading the way for the Eagles. A sizeable second half awaits. A bit like Minority Report, the Thunderbirds started well but ended up quite unwatchable. Fifteen goals in the first quarter were followed by just 22 more for the rest of the match as the Lightning remind all and sundry why they are genuine title contenders. Cara Koenen netted 30 from 32 attempts for the home side, who sew up the minor premiership and a major semi-final against the Swifts. Cricket: Pattinson has been removed for a rather handy 20, leaving Australia seven wickets down but over 330 runs to the good. But don\u2019t take my word for it, not when Adam Collins is waxing his lyrical best. AFL: QT: West Coast 4.3 (27) vs Hawthorn 3.3 (21) - the Hawks kick the first three goals of the game but, obviously given the score, the Eagles flex their muscly wings to boot four straight and take a six-point lead into quarter-time. They\u2019ve got some gears, West Coast, and some serious potency up front when the opportunity presents. AFL: HT: Gold Coast 3.10 (28) vs Greater Western Sydney 8.2 (50) - on the face of it, 13 scoring shots to 10 says the Suns have been the better team in the first half. Back in the real world, the Giants are (kind of) doing as they please and Jeremy Cameron has booted two goals in his quest to claim the Coleman Medal. To the eagle-eyed amongst you, is it plagiarism if you copy yourself? Super Netball: 3QT: Lightning 42-30 Thunderbirds - the Thunderbirds scored as many goals in the second and third terms combined as they did in the first. The Lightning have almost quadrupled their score since quarter-time. Enough said. NRL: HT: Dragons 0-28 Roosters - It\u2019s getting ugly at Kogarah. Five tries to the visitors and Cooper Cronk kicking like a man possessed doesn\u2019t make great viewing for the ever-suffering Dragons faithful. And the people are speaking. Cricket: Australia\u2019s lead at Headingley is edging towards 300. All of a sudden this deck looks a reasonable one to bat on. Why are you wasting your time with me when Adam Collins is doing what he does so well? (Go and check out his live blog, oh so momentarily, and then come back to me ... please) Super Netball: HT: Lightning 24-22 Thunderbirds - the lowly Thunderbirds were, um, go early in this game but the Lightning resumed normal service in the second quarter to take a slender lead into half-time of this low-scoring game. AFL: QT: Gold Coast 0.4 (4) vs Greater Western Sydney 5.0 (30) - on the face of it, four scoring shots to five is a competitive return for the Suns. Back in the real world, the Giants are doing as they please and Jeremy Cameron has booted two goals in his quest to claim the Coleman Medal. NRL: 16 mins: Dragons 0-18 Roosters - not sure St George-Illawarra ever really promised much this season, but any hope Dragons fans ever had has surely now made way for lonely despair. Don\u2019t worry, it will all be over soon. I\u2019d watch Patty Mills play basketball every day of the week and twice on Sunday. As you were. Evening, sports fans. How\u2019s your Saturday been treating you? You\u2019ve been kept excellent company by Megan, so I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re in good spirits. Am I alone in thinking that whatever we witness tonight \u2013 be it in the AFL, the NRL, cricket, Super Netball or tiddly winks \u2013 it will take some living up to the Boomers\u2019 win over Team USA. OK, it was only an exhibition game, but when you consider droughts this arid, in a sport so completely dominated by one nation, thoughts wander back to a certain boat race back in 1983. If you\u2019re unfortunate enough to have to work tomorrow, call your boss and tell said boss you\u2019re not coming in. If said boss sacks you, tell said boss I think said boss is a bum. Anyway, moving on, we have a pivotal game in the AFL on our evening agenda, with West Coast hosting Hawthorn in a tussle that could well have ramifications on the top four and top eight. Gold Coast and Greater Western Sydney will also be kicking around a Sherrin, the Dragons and the Roosters will battle it out in the NRL, the Lightning host the Thunderbirds in Super Netball \u2026 and there is a game of cricket going on in England, or so I\u2019m told. But I don\u2019t want to do this solo. Your input is required, so comments are open below the line and you can reach me directly via email or Twitter - @scott_heinrich Okay, well that\u2019s me out for tonight! I\u2019ve very much enjoyed your company as we\u2019ve worked our way though some absolute nailbiters and some total capitulations around Australia tonight. I\u2019m now leaving you in the very capable hands of my esteemed colleague Scott Heinrich who will see you through the rest of tonight\u2019s games. Don\u2019t forget we\u2019ve got our cricket live blog kicking off very shortly, so make sure you\u2019ve got two tabs going so you can keep up with all the action. So long, farewell, Auf Wiedersehen, goodbye! The Tigers recorded their biggest victory in four years to keep their finals hopes alive at Campbelltown tonight. It was a dominant performance from start to finish from the black and orange and they had so much energy around the team. Speaking after the game, Josh Reynolds was pleased with the result and his return after a break with injury. \u201cLife\u2019s too short, you\u2019ve just got to have fun,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just looking forward to the last two games. Let\u2019s hold on to that energy moving forward next week.\u201d It wasn\u2019t the end to the season the Blues would have hoped for, but at least it\u2019s over now. Geelong, on the other hand, look to have played their way into a minor premiership, barring a huge smashing by either Richmond or West Coast this weekend, which doesn\u2019t look likely. It\u2019s been a hell of a season from the Geelong boys, it\u2019ll be fascinating to see what they can bring to the finals. What a finish! Though the Swifts snuck away with the win, they will be bitterly disappointed they couldn\u2019t get the last bonus point, with a tied final quarter. They will now have to wait to see how the Lightning fare against the Thunderbirds to see if they will get to host next week\u2019s semi-final. Luckily that game is up next, so not too long for them to wait! An emotional finish for the Firebirds who are farewelling retiring players Caitlyn Nevins and Laura Clemesha. Gretel Tippett was outstanding in a losing team and took out the MVP award. \u201cWe wanted to end on a good note, but today the Swifts were just too good,\u201d she said after the game. \u201cWe want to carry momentum into next season, so we\u2019re happy we finished with two good games.\u201d NRL: While the Dragons\u2019 game against the Roosters tonight isn\u2019t a huge for a team well out of finals contention, it does have something to make it meaningful. Wendell Sailor\u2019s son Tristan is set to make his debut for the Red V. Sailor has been an extraordinary part of the club since joining them in 2007 and has remained part of the heart and soul following his retirement in 2009. Tristan will play at fullback tonight and hopefully bring some of the Sailor spirit to a Dragons team that desperately needs it. Super Netball: Swifts 49-48 Firebirds The Swifts have clawed back the lead and taken the bonus point, but what a fourth quarter we have coming up! The umpire who will be at the Firebirds\u2019 shooting end this quarter has been handing out a lot more penalties, so the Swifts\u2019 defenders will have to be very clean to come away with a win here. AFL: Geelong 14.6 (90) v Carlton 6.13 (49) at three quarter-time Carlton haven\u2019t given up just yet - though they\u2019re not \u201cin it\u201d in any sense of the word, they are determined to keep going until the very last whistle. Gary Ablett has stepped up with three goals to his name, while Dangerfield continues to rack up stats like they\u2019re going out of style. AFL: The second of the Adam Goodes documentaries, The Australian Dream, is out and by all reports it\u2019s brilliant, sad and thought-provoking in equal measures. One of our commenters has some wonderful words about it, so I will turn it over to them because I don\u2019t think I can say it better. Concussion in sport: I had some thoughts this week on the way Australia makes heroes of the walking wounded who battle through games to victory. That imagery we\u2019ve created is going to be a stumbling block in the way we deal with concussion, I feel. I\u2019m interested to know your thoughts, so let me know in the comments. NRL: Wests Tigers 30-0 Newcastle What a start from the Tigers in Campbelltown tonight! An incredible first half sees the crowd rise for a standing ovation as they leave the field. Five tries to five different try-scorers in the first half have given the crowd plenty to cheer about. Matthew Eisenhuth has been a force to be reckoned with, making 114 metres so far this game, ably supported by Luke Garner who has made 99 metres and scored a try to boot. Super Netball: Swifts 30-33 Firebirds at half-time Well, what a second quarter from the Purple Birds as they are (sometimes not affectionately) known. Gretel Tippett had something to smile about that quarter, as her team stole the lead and the bonus point from the home team. An even shooting load split between Tippett and her GS Romelda Aiken is working well for the Queenslanders, as they force the Swifts\u2019 defenders to work individually, not as a unit. Much like their Sydney buddies the Giants, the Swifts need every bonus point they can get their hands on if they want to get the minor premiership and a home semi-final next week. They will be very upset with themselves for letting that one go. Cricket: Andy Bull had an interesting article during the week about the perception of fast bowlers hitting a new peak. Andy has found a way to make very precise scientific facts and measurements sound exciting - no easy feat I can tell you! Make sure you have a look before the cricket gets back underway in a couple of hours. AFL: Geelong 12.5 (77) v Carlton 3.8 (26) at half-time The Cats have built on their first-quarter performance, piling on another seven goals this quarter, while the Blues have managed to score double the amount of goals they did in the first - though I\u2019m not sure they\u2019ll be celebrating that achievement! Dangerfield remains the danger player, while Marc Murphy, with 19 disposals and three tackles, is putting out an admirable performance in a losing team. Super Netball: Swifts 18-14 Firebirds at quarter-time It\u2019s fair to say that Gretel Tippett is not having a great time out there today. Whether she\u2019s tired from carrying her under-performing team all season or she just wants to be done with it after a punishing netball schedule this year, she doesn\u2019t have her happy pants on today. The Swifts have made some interesting tweaks to their defensive end with Maddy Turner in WD, Sarah Klau in GD and Katrina Rore in GK and it\u2019s working well for them so far. Football: Another great read during the week was Kieran Pender\u2019s interview with former Matildas vice-captain and member of the Fifa Council, Moya Dodd. This quote from Dodd was particularly insightful: \u201cWomen\u2019s football went from being neglected without consequence to a gold star issue, in that you got a gold star for doing something for the women\u2019s game,\u201d says Dodd. \u201cNow it needs to move towards a consistent and equal program of involvement and investment. The return on investment on a marginal dollar in women\u2019s football is far higher than on a dollar in men\u2019s football, where the progress has already been made.\u201d NRL: If you\u2019re a rugby league fan, you\u2019ll enjoy this fascinating new book by Joe Gorman about the history of the game in Queensland and how it shaped the culture and persona of the state. This excerpt is a great scene-setter and explains how the Broncos, one of the NRL\u2019s most dominant teams, came to be. Cricket: Only a few hours now until the bowling showdown between Australia and England continues. If you slept through all the excitement last night, never fear - we have you covered! Read all about the wicket fest here. AFL: Geelong 5.4 (34) v Carlton 1.3 (9) at quarter-time It\u2019s not a happy game for the Blues so far, I suspect they are already at the pub after the game in their minds. It\u2019s also not an ideal final round game for the Cats - despite the very welcome opportunity to take out the minor premiership - as you\u2019d imagine they could do with a higher intensity game to help with their run at the premiership. Dangerfield has been strong at the goals so far with three goals just in the first quarter. A big win for the Sharks will give them a lot of confidence going into the last two rounds of the regular season. Another big half from the ex-Dragon Joshes (Morris and Dugan) saw the Sharks build on their lead and the Warriors barely got a look in. Despite a superior completion rate, the Kiwis just didn\u2019t see enough of the ball and Shaun Johnson will be feeling pretty happy with his decision to move across the ditch. The Fever managed to claw back a bonus point for the last quarter, which Giants\u2019 coach Julie Fitzgerald looked highly unimpressed about. She would have instructed her to team to go out there and get all eight points to secure their finals berth, but they will now have to wait on results from tomorrow afternoon\u2019s game. It\u2019s still a tough ask for the Magpies who will need a decent win and at least three of the four bonus points to topple the Giants, but they have been in strong form and will be giving it a pretty good shake. Kim Green was solid for the Giants in her final home game before retirement, with 21 goal assists and 34 feeds, as well as two intercepts and two gains - pretty impressive defensive stats for a wing attack! Well, that was an unexpected win from the Boomers - their first game was overshadowed by a seating fiasco, but this time they managed to be more newsworthy than a bunch of plastic lawn chairs, so well done to them! They\u2019ll be feeling more confident about the World Cup after that - the first time they have defeated the USA in 55 years and 26 attempts. It stayed close right up until the end, but in the end it was North who ran away with the win. Jared Polec and Shaun Higgins were the stars for the home side, with two goals each. It wasn\u2019t the ending retiring Dees player Jordan Lewis would have liked, but he was happy with what he can take from his career. \u201cIt was exciting, I think we played a good brand of footy for most of the game,\u201d he said after the game. \u201cNorth Melbourne are a quality side. It\u2019s not ideal to end your career with a loss, but that\u2019s the way it goes. I\u2019m ready, it\u2019s been a long career. I look at my three beautiful children and now I get to spend more time with them, so why wouldn\u2019t you retire?\u201d Super Netball: Giants 54-42 Fever at three quarter-time This is a pretty frustrating and scrappy game to watch. Fever are showing plenty of heart in defence and turning the ball over, but the attack end just can\u2019t capitalise. Considering the shooting power of Jhaniele Fowler under the post, they will be asking some serious questions in the off-season. It was the defence end that was supposed to be their worry today with captain Courtney Bruce out, but they are struggling much more in attack. Fever had three opportunities to level the score but failed to do so and the Giants took another bonus point. Well what a big day for #Buddy300 - the man himself was on fire with four goals and 10 marks, ably supported by the other Josh Kennedy with 30 disposals and nine tackles. According to Buddy\u2019s official number one fan, Imogen Dunlevie, who is also the offical keeper of Buddy Goal Watch, he is now on 944 career goals, which is a truly a phenomenal effort - and he\u2019s not done yet! Speaking after the game, he was effusive in his praise ofthe Swans\u2019 retiring players - Jarrad McVeigh and Kieran Jack. \u201cThey\u2019ve been a big part of the club, they really drive the bloods culture,\u201d Franklin said. \u201cIt was a special day. I\u2019ve had nearly nine weeks off, so I was definitely blowing. They challenged us, but we were able to stand up in the third quarter and come away with a really good win.\u201d AFL: Melbourne 11.4 (70) v North Melbourne 10.9 (69) at three quarter-time It\u2019s still a tight one down in Tassie, but Melbourne have been more accurate with the boot this quarter, kicking six goals to five. Rory Gilmore fan Max Gawn is still leading the way for the Dees, while Jared Polec with 20 disposals and two goals is doing his best to keep the Roos in the game. Super Netball: Giants 38-28 Fever at half-time Well after the Fever did their duty of keeping the fans guessing on the final make-up of the top four until the last game of the round, they promptly fell asleep and watched on as the Giants took a 10-goal lead. Perhaps they were inspired by the Swans and will be looking to make a third quarter resurgence, just to keep us guessing even more. To illustrate further the weirdness of the bonus points system, the Fever could win the next two quarters by one goal each to lose by eight and end up taking three points out of the game to the Giants\u2019 five. The Magpies will certainly be hoping that\u2019s the way the game goes anyway! Rugby: Thoughts on the World Cup squad announced this week? Our rugby reporter Bret Harris thinks it\u2019s a risky one - not for the World Cup per se, but for the future of Super Rugby. \u201cThere is no doubt the Wallabies squad is stronger with O\u2019Connor, White and Toomua in it and may have been even more so with Skelton as well, but is it really that much stronger? Strong enough to make a difference? We will see. \u201cThere were few, if any, real surprises in what was a fairly solid-looking squad, the only notable omission Brumbies fullback Tom Banks, and gambling on the fitness of David Pocock. \u201cCheika got almost all of the players he wanted from home and abroad. The Wallabies will now need to win the World Cup, or go close, to justify any potential damage to Super Rugby as a result of the relaxing of the eligibility rules.\u201d NRL: Sharks 24-10 Warriors at half-time The theme of the Sharks\u2019 first half at Shark Park today has clearly been \u201cformer Dragons who are also called Josh\u201d as Josh Morris and Josh Dugan both scored key tries for the boys in the black, white and blue. Dugan has also made a phenomenal 139 metres in a dominant performance. With the Sharks hanging on to eighth place as if their lives depended on it, a win today will be key to their finals hopes. AFL: Sydney 11.4 (70) v St Kilda 7.12 (54) at three quarter-time The Swans remembered to play in the third quarter! Great news for their fans. It\u2019s been a big game for the other Josh Kennedy, as I like to call him, possibly because I\u2019m related to the West Coast Josh Kennedy, who could tell? Anyway, this one is quite good too and he has 23 disposals and six tackles so far. Let\u2019s see if the Swans can bring this home. Super Netball: Giants 17-17 Fever at quarter-time A drawn first quarter means no one takes a bonus, point which means that whatever the result today, fourth place will be decided by the Magpies v Vixens game in Melbourne tomorrow. The Fever looked good through the middle of the quarter, but some messy attack let them down, despite the best efforts of Olivia Lewis at GK - having a dominant performance on Diamonds captain Caitlin Bassett - a huge quarter from Lewis in her rookie season. Cricket: The Australian women\u2019s team has launched their new Indigenous uniforms that they will wear against England in February in Canberra. The story behind them is pretty interesting too, make sure you check it out. AFL: North Melbourne 5.4 (34) v Melbourne 5.4 (34) at half-time What is going on today? Another game all locked up at half-time? This one has been a little more even and also has the lovely symmetry of both teams with equal goals and behinds, which is a personal favourite draw situation of mine. Max Gawn has been on fire for the Dees, with 18 hitouts and 11 disposals to his name. He is also a personal favourite of mine due to his love of Gilmore Girls, so hopefully he is more of a Dean than a Jess as this game continues. Super Netball: The Giants are about to take on the West Coast Fever, which may not seem like such an important game, as the Fever can\u2019t make finals no matter the score today. However it is a very important game in deciding the final four. With the Giants sitting in fourth, just one bonus point ahead of the Collingwood Magpies, a win with all four bonus points would mean they secure the last spot in the finals. However, a win with three or less bonus points opens the door for the Magpies to swoop in (see what I did there) and knock the Giants down to fifth. Some tough questions are being asked of the bonus point system this year - the Giants have six wins, six losses and a draw to the Magpies\u2019 six wins, five losses and two draws so there are many people questioning the way the system is working to determine ladder positions. Also, while we\u2019re on netball, Erin Delahunty had a great column during the week on the stark contrasts between the top and bottom teams in the competition - another issue for the newly established Commission to look at in the off-season. AFL: Speaking of the Pride game, there\u2019s a great article by Emma Race up today about the importance of queer women in the history of women\u2019s footy. For someone like myself who has come to the game fairly recently, it\u2019s a brilliant education, but there are plenty of gems in there for rusted on AFL fans as well. Do yourself a favour and give it a read. AFL: Sydney 6.3 (39) v St Kilda 5.9 (39) at half-time It\u2019s a close one at the main break at the SCG for the AFL\u2019s Pride game. A strong first quarter from the Swans gave way to a second quarter they\u2019d like to forget, or perhaps did forget and didn\u2019t show up for? It allowed St Kilda to close the gap and ensure there was nothing in it at half-time. The happy news for the Swans is that Buddy\u2019s making his mark in is 300th game, with six kicks, six disposals and a goal. No doubt he will continue to build on those stats in the second half and bring the Swans out of that second quarter slump. It\u2019ll be the last game of 2019 for both teams, who will want to finish with a win in a pretty forgettable season. Welcome back to another big weekend in the sporting world - what a day of cricket we had overnight! It kind of feels like both teams might as well give up on batting now and select 11 bowlers each for the fourth Test. Our Ashes live blog will be back tonight to take you through what\u2019s sure to be another very exciting day. Here on Sportwatch we\u2019ve got bucketloads of AFL, which I know will make our BTL buddies very happy, plus three games in the Super Netball, plenty of NRL and part two in the saga that is Boomers v USA - if you\u2019re at that game, you might want to stay with us here so we can keep you updated on what\u2019s happening! So, a big night ahead of us, let\u2019s get into it.",

      "body": "<p>Taylor Swift is more of a lover than a fighter. The singer-songwriter doesn\u2019t say it out loud on her seventh album \u2013 the successor to 2017\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/12/taylor-swift-reputation-review\" title=\"\">Reputation</a></em>, an aggressive record in which she came out swinging \u2013 but it\u2019s hard to escape the conclusion on a record that Swift is calling \u201ca love letter to love\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m in my feelings more than Drake, so, yeah,\u201d she winks at one point.</p> <p><em>Reputation</em>\u2019s murky mood board went big on snakes, bling and shade thrown and received, the aftermath of a highly public feud with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian West. By contrast, <em>Lover</em> is a kitsch-leaning festival of humour, pastels, butterflies and the desire not to be defined by negatives. It is, in large parts, a hoot.</p> <p>For a songwriter of such control and emotional intelligence, Swift is rather over-partial to obvious juxtapositions \u2013 her lyrics often hinge sharply on roses and thorns, sunshine and rain. Daylight, the 18th and final track on this long album, finds Swift waking from \u201c20 years of sleep\u201d.</p> <p>But her binaries aren\u2019t always absolute. You get the feeling that if the \u201cold Taylor\u201d was \u201cdead\u201d at the start of the <em>Reputation</em> era, she was only ever in suspended animation, in a kind of R&amp;B-adjacent fever dream. <em>Lover</em> returns to business as usual, the dramatic pop of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/26/taylor-swift-1989-album-review-bold-gossipy-confection\" title=\"\">1989</a></em> via the confessionals of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/oct/21/taylor-swift-red-review\" title=\"\">Red</a></em>. Swift is back in her happy place, writing finger-snapping pop songs about falling in and out of love, abetted by a variety of producers, two of whom now ping-pong regularly between her and Lorde: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/09/taylor-swift-producer-jack-antonoff-im-drawn-to-female-artists-who-are-brutally-honest\" title=\"\">Jack Antonoff</a>, producer of Lorde\u2019s 2017 album <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/18/lorde-melodrama-review-maximum-overwrought-green-light-liability\" title=\"\">Melodrama</a></em> and lots of Swift\u2019s last two albums; and Joel Little, the midwife to Lorde\u2019s early work. Trailers such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuXNumBwDOM\" title=\"\">ME!</a> \u2013 a duet with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/mar/25/panic-at-the-disco-review-ballads-backflips-and-big-top-emotion\" title=\"\">Panic! at the Disco</a>\u2019s Brendon Urie that verges on a cheerleader chant \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkk9gvTmCXY\" title=\"\">You Need to Calm Down</a>, a fabulously pitched takedown of haters, bigots and internet trolls, have exuded playfulness, tunefulness and wit in equal measure.</p> <p>An album so long is bound to be a mixed bag. Strong opener I Forgot That You Existed is a breezy kiss-off to an old flame or, perhaps the whole Kimye era: \u201cLived in the shade you were throwing till all of my sunshine was gone,\u201d Swift recounts.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuXNumBwDOM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FuXNumBwDOM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuXNumBwDOM\">Watch a video for Taylor Swift\u2019s ME!</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>By track 11, though, Swift is hymning her current flame, the British actor Joe Alwyn, who \u201ctook her back to Highgate\u201d to \u201cmeet all of his best mates\u201d on a cringe-inducing song called London Boy. This sort of thing might pass on one side of the Atlantic but, on the other side, it is redolent of Guy Ritchie-era Madonna in her tweeds drinking bitter. (In Swift\u2019s partial defence, the song expresses a desire to see Hackney, \u201cnot just Louis V on Bond Street\u201d.)</p> <p>For every reasonable assumption of a return to form, however, there\u2019s the suspicion that <em>Lover</em> might be at least a partial retrenchment until Swift decides what to do next. If it sounds as if we\u2019ve been here before, it\u2019s because we have. Many of <em>Lover</em>\u2019s songs are recognisable in structure and content from albums past, with Swift\u2019s signature shouty endings, her key changes that keep things moving along and her carefully deployed lyrical detail all to the fore. Anticipatory tunes such as I Think He Knows and Paper Rings flirt hard, but perhaps not quite as hard as <em>1989</em>\u2019s magisterial <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-ORhEE9VVg\" title=\"\">Blank Space</a> did. \u201cWho could ever leave me darling,\u201d sings Swift on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KpKc3C9V3w\" title=\"\">The Archer</a>, a moodier, more elliptical track, \u201cbut who could stay?\u201d \u2013 revisiting the idea of Swift being a romantic handful, present on Blank Space and other songs passim. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=4&amp;v=cvUAzpn48xA\" title=\"\">Lover</a>, the title track itself, is a perfectly good ballad, light on detail but with a fantastic pregnant gap in its dynamic and a husk to Swift\u2019s voice that could grow to become more interesting.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/aug/24/taylor-swift-pop-music-hunger-games-gladiators\">Taylor Swift: \u2018I was literally about to break\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The heart, not unreasonably, takes up a fair amount of airtime on <em>Lover</em>, but Swift has other concerns. There\u2019s fight left in her, too, in the form of The Man, a bouncy Joel Little production where Swift decries the double standards by which high-profile females are judged. In an alternative reality, she\u2019s \u201can alpha\u201d making \u201cpower moves\u201d, and not hung out to dry for dating a succession of men.</p> <p>Soon You\u2019ll Get Better, by contrast, is a stark song set in a doctor\u2019s office that is likely to allude to Swift\u2019s mother, whose cancer has returned. The track features backing vocals, banjo and fiddle by two Dixie Chicks, a country outfit whose opposition to the Iraq war landed them in hot water with US conservatives during the George W Bush administration. Their presence is indicative of some heavy signalling by Swift, who has been criticised for not being clearer about her own politics.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkk9gvTmCXY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Dkk9gvTmCXY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkk9gvTmCXY\">Watch a video for Taylor Swift\u2019s You Need to Calm Down.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>You Need to Calm Down is pretty unequivocal about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/aug/09/taylor-swift-reveals-why-she-took-a-stand-for-lgbtq-rights\" title=\"\">LGBTQ+ advocacy</a>. More coded, perhaps, is a song called Miss Americana &amp; the Heartbreak Prince, in which Swift deploys a high-school setting and lines about her own \u201cpageant smile\u201d to land some allegorical content. \u201cAmerican glory / Faded before me / Now I\u2019m feeling hopeless / Ripping up my prom dress\u201d, it goes, voicing a generalised distress at the state of her nation.</p> <p>Swift\u2019s tanker has been slow to turn round, and is still turning. It\u2019s said that celebrities remain stunted at the age at which they became famous, a kernel of truth that Swift seems strangely keen to emphasise. The four bonus editions of <em>Lover</em> come with journals, which mix entries from Swift\u2019s own diaries, from her teenage years and beyond, that detail attempts in 2007 to locate a turkey fryer to the aftermath of Kanye West\u2019s 2009 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/sep/14/kanye-west-taylor-swift-vmas\" title=\"\">VMA </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/sep/14/kanye-west-taylor-swift-vmas\" title=\"\">awards hijack</a>. There are blank pages for fans to fill in. At nearly 30, the singer-songwriter remains an intriguing mixture of industry power-broker and giddy cat-obsessive. <em>Lover</em> is fine with that, but the real battle is where she goes after this.</p>",

Swift is back in her happy place, writing finger-snapping pop songs about falling in and out of love, abetted by a variety of producers, two of whom now ping-pong regularly between her and Lorde: Jack Antonoff, producer of Lorde\u2019s 2017 album Melodrama and lots of Swift\u2019s last two albums; and Joel Little, the midwife to Lorde\u2019s early work. Trailers such as ME! \u2013 a duet with Panic! at the Disco\u2019s Brendon Urie that verges on a cheerleader chant \u2013 and You Need to Calm Down, a fabulously pitched takedown of haters, bigots and internet trolls, have exuded playfulness, tunefulness and wit in equal measure. An album so long is bound to be a mixed bag. Strong opener I Forgot That You Existed is a breezy kiss-off to an old flame or, perhaps the whole Kimye era: \u201cLived in the shade you were throwing till all of my sunshine was gone,\u201d Swift recounts. By track 11, though, Swift is hymning her current flame, the British actor Joe Alwyn, who \u201ctook her back to Highgate\u201d to \u201cmeet all of his best mates\u201d on a cringe-inducing song called London Boy. This sort of thing might pass on one side of the Atlantic but, on the other side, it is redolent of Guy Ritchie-era Madonna in her tweeds drinking bitter. (In Swift\u2019s partial defence, the song expresses a desire to see Hackney, \u201cnot just Louis V on Bond Street\u201d.) For every reasonable assumption of a return to form, however, there\u2019s the suspicion that Lover might be at least a partial retrenchment until Swift decides what to do next. If it sounds as if we\u2019ve been here before, it\u2019s because we have. Many of Lover\u2019s songs are recognisable in structure and content from albums past, with Swift\u2019s signature shouty endings, her key changes that keep things moving along and her carefully deployed lyrical detail all to the fore. Anticipatory tunes such as I Think He Knows and Paper Rings flirt hard, but perhaps not quite as hard as 1989\u2019s magisterial Blank Space did. \u201cWho could ever leave me darling,\u201d sings Swift on The Archer, a moodier, more elliptical track, \u201cbut who could stay?\u201d \u2013 revisiting the idea of Swift being a romantic handful, present on Blank Space and other songs passim. Lover, the title track itself, is a perfectly good ballad, light on detail but with a fantastic pregnant gap in its dynamic and a husk to Swift\u2019s voice that could grow to become more interesting. The heart, not unreasonably, takes up a fair amount of airtime on Lover, but Swift has other concerns. There\u2019s fight left in her, too, in the form of The Man, a bouncy Joel Little production where Swift decries the double standards by which high-profile females are judged. In an alternative reality, she\u2019s \u201can alpha\u201d making \u201cpower moves\u201d, and not hung out to dry for dating a succession of men. Soon You\u2019ll Get Better, by contrast, is a stark song set in a doctor\u2019s office that is likely to allude to Swift\u2019s mother, whose cancer has returned. The track features backing vocals, banjo and fiddle by two Dixie Chicks, a country outfit whose opposition to the Iraq war landed them in hot water with US conservatives during the George W Bush administration. Their presence is indicative of some heavy signalling by Swift, who has been criticised for not being clearer about her own politics. You Need to Calm Down is pretty unequivocal about LGBTQ+ advocacy. More coded, perhaps, is a song called Miss Americana &amp; the Heartbreak Prince, in which Swift deploys a high-school setting and lines about her own \u201cpageant smile\u201d to land some allegorical content. \u201cAmerican glory / Faded before me / Now I\u2019m feeling hopeless / Ripping up my prom dress\u201d, it goes, voicing a generalised distress at the state of her nation. Swift\u2019s tanker has been slow to turn round, and is still turning. It\u2019s said that celebrities remain stunted at the age at which they became famous, a kernel of truth that Swift seems strangely keen to emphasise. The four bonus editions of Lover come with journals, which mix entries from Swift\u2019s own diaries, from her teenage years and beyond, that detail attempts in 2007 to locate a turkey fryer to the aftermath of Kanye West\u2019s 2009 VMA awards hijack. There are blank pages for fans to fill in. At nearly 30, the singer-songwriter remains an intriguing mixture of industry power-broker and giddy cat-obsessive. Lover is fine with that, but the real battle is where she goes after this.",

      "body": "<p>The artist Simon Starling, who won the Turner prize in 2005 for <em><a href=\"https://www.themoderninstitute.com/artists/simon-starling/works/shedboatshed-mobile-architecture-no-2-2005/88/\" title=\"\">Shedboatshed</a></em> \u2013 for which he turned a wooden shed into a boat and sailed it down the Rhine before reassembling it as a shed in a Swiss gallery \u2013 was born in Epsom, Surrey in 1967. He studied at Maidstone College of Art and later attended the Glasgow School of Art. Starling represented Scotland at the Venice Biennale in 2003. His sixth solo exhibition, <a href=\"https://www.themoderninstitute.com/artists/simon-starling\" title=\"\">A-A\u2019, B-B\u2019</a>, takes place between the Modern Institute in Glasgow (7 Sept-26 Oct) and the Galleria Franco Noero in Turin (15 Oct-11 Jan). Starling lives and works in Copenhagen.</p> <p><strong>A-A\u2019, B-B\u2019</strong><em><strong> </strong></em><strong>is a work of divisions and connections across time and space. What was the spark for it?</strong><br>Coming across a fragment of a Tiepolo painting, <em>Halbardier in a Landscape</em>, in the <a href=\"https://www.pinacoteca-agnelli.it/visit/en/\" title=\"\">Agnelli collection</a> in Turin about 10 years ago. Much more recently I learned how, in the early 19th century, it was cut from a larger painting called <em><a href=\"https://www.nationalgalleries.org/art-and-artists/5506/finding-moses\" title=\"\">The Finding of Moses</a></em>, which is now in the Scottish National Gallery. I have occasionally made shows where I try to connect to two venues in a single exhibition, and I guess, because of what\u2019s happening in Britain with Brexit, it seemed like an irresistible moment to make an exhibition about a divided painting.</p> <p><strong>The work also features a divided car\u2026 </strong><br>I quite enjoy taking the logic from one situation and transposing it on to another. What I\u2019ve done is take a <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry/cars-giovanni-agnelli-picture-special\" title=\"\">blue Fiat 125</a>, which was the type of car that [former Fiat boss] <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/jan/24/guardianobituaries.italy\" title=\"\">Giovanni Agnelli</a>, the owner of the <em>Halbardier</em> painting, drove around Turin in the 1970s and 80s. That car has been cut into two pieces, in the same proportion as the painting was cut, and the smaller part of the car will go with the larger part of the painting in Turin and vice versa. So it\u2019s a collapse of these two stories. <em>The Finding of Moses </em>takes this rather humble biblical story and transposes it into courtly splendour \u2013 Tiepolo was appealing to his clients. And then you have this contrary story where this Italian playboy Agnelli, who had an extraordinary car collection, drove a standard issue Fiat 125 around Turin, endearing himself with his workers and the people of Turin. So there\u2019s a masquerade which seems to underline or connect these two stories.</p> <p><strong>Was it difficult to find a car to cut in two?<br></strong>It was quite hard to find one in the right colour blue. But eventually we found a car in fantastic condition in Rome. I\u2019m kind of lucky with these things; I have a feeling that when you go looking for something, you generally find it. The car was cut in half on the biggest band saw I\u2019ve ever seen. It took nine hours. It was extraordinary.</p> <p><strong>You have a long-running interest in the deconstruction and transformation of objects. What\u2019s at the root of that?</strong><br>It\u2019s partly developed out of a curiosity for how things work, which goes back to my childhood. I had a father who didn\u2019t like to pay anybody to do something if he thought he could do himself. I was always surrounded by tools, and a DIY culture, which was completely liberating for me, to be able to go into his little workshop and build something or try to make something fly. That mentality has always been part of the way I think as an artist.</p> <p><strong>Do your ideas tend to come incrementally or all at once?<br></strong>Increasingly, I think they come incrementally. When I was 20, I used to dream artworks: they popped into my head fully formed in those half awake, half-asleep moments. But nowadays it\u2019s much harder. Partly it\u2019s because you become a little bit more demanding of yourself and your ideas, so a lot of the projects evolve over years rather than months. But also \u2013 and it always sounds a little bit nutty when I talk about it \u2013 I have this idea that the work has a life of its own and that it\u2019s only partly in my control. Very often it\u2019s chance occurrences that trigger things \u2013 your gallerist in Italy taking you to see a particular painting, which 10 years later becomes a work.</p> <p><strong>Have you ever had to abandon a piece midway through because it becomes too difficult to execute?</strong><br>What happens is that things morph into something else, rather than me abandoning them. One nice example was a project I made called <em>Island for Weeds</em>, which ended up being shown in the Scottish pavilion at the Venice Biennale. It was originally supposed to be a floating island to support a little colony of rhododendrons on Loch Lomond, in the new national park. The proposal was accepted, but as we were going into production, one of the supporters of the project, Scottish National Heritage, suddenly got cold feet \u2013 they were worried my project supporting this invasive species was going to backfire on them \u2013 and pulled the plug. But in Venice, this homeless island <a href=\"https://artimage.org.uk/18400/simon-starling/island-for-weeds--prototype---2003-\" title=\"\">in a pavilion overlooking the Grand Canal</a>, with unwanted rhododendrons blooming on the top, had a beautiful new drama to it.</p> <p><strong>Do have any interest in the digital world? I can\u2019t find you on social media, for example.</strong><br>No, I\u2019ve stayed away from that to a large degree. I feel like my days are so full of other things that the idea of finding the time to look at Instagram feels exhausting to me. I\u2019ve been working with early computer technologies \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/videos/j/video-jacquard-weaving/\" title=\"\">Jacquard weaving</a> and the punch card and Babbage. For me, that\u2019s where digital technology is interesting \u2013 at its beginnings, when you can put your hands on it and kind of understand it, as opposed to now, when I have no idea what goes on in my mobile phone.</p> <p><strong>How did winning the Turner prize impact on your life? </strong><br>If I go pretty much anywhere in the world to do a lecture, or whatever, people turn up now. It\u2019s a hugely potent byline, internationally. Because, you know, I don\u2019t make the work for myself: it\u2019s nice to have people look at it [laughs].</p> <p><strong>What do you get up to for fun?</strong><br>Mostly cooking and playing tennis. I just found a wonderful Mexican writer, \u00c1lvaro Enrigue, who wrote a book [<em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/30/sudden-death-by-alvaro-enrigue-review\" title=\"\">Sudden Death</a></em>] about Caravaggio and tennis, and it really felt like a book that was written for me. Two passions rolled into one.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s next?<br></strong>I\u2019ve been planning a new film project, which I\u2019m hoping to make in Malta next year, about Caravaggio, and particularly <em><a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/La_decapitaci%C3%B3n_de_San_Juan_Bautista%2C_por_Caravaggio.jpg\" title=\"\">The Beheading of St John the Baptist </a></em>painting that he made in Malta. It\u2019s an attempt to re-enact that painting using extras \u2013 trying to connect the culture of extras that\u2019s popped up in Malta with Caravaggio\u2019s use of the common man in his paintings, the dirty fingernails and dirty feet and all of that sort of thing.

Real name Jeremy Nutzman, under his current moniker he makes gorgeously expansive sounds that meld and melt the lines between everything from lush synthpop, experimental electronic and choppy rap to reggae and dub.

In an interview with the Fader, he described discovering a pile of abandoned CDs on his neighbour\u2019s lawn, though all his attempts to hoard such treasures \u2013 even hiding them in air vents \u2013 were found out. Going to college (and eventually dropping out) allowed Nutzman to spread his wings and start writing.

      "body": "<p>Casually derided for its loud mouth, bad taste and louche, estuarine ways, Essex is the whipping boy of England. Unlike Kent, the garden of England, and Surrey, its patio, Essex is not softened by ersatz pastoralism or laced with gin-and-Jag smugness. Charles Dickens once described Chelmsford, its administrative capital, as \u201cthe dullest and most stupid spot on the face of the earth\u201d.</p> <p>Pinioned by water on one side and London on the other, Essex has a sense of being perpetually under siege from both the sea and the elephantine presence of the metropolis, \u201ca seeping inkblot on the horizon\u201d that over time has greedily gobbled up extremities such as Ilford and Romford. Threats of inundation and invasion have always weighed heavily on the Essex mind, most recently articulated by an unflinching urge to uncouple from Europe. Parsed and pored over by politicians, psephologists and the press, Essex is stubbornly unafraid to make manifest its discontent and go its own cussed way.</p> <p>But as <a href=\"http://www.gilliandarley.com/\" title=\"\">Gillian Darley</a>\u2019s new biography of England\u2019s most maligned and misunderstood county persuasively demonstrates, Essex is more than the crude caricature connoted by referendum statistics. <em><a href=\"http://oldstreetpublishing.co.uk/46/excellent-essex\">Excellent Essex: In Praise of Britain\u2019s Most Misunderstood County</a></em><strong> </strong>is a richly nuanced billet doux to a terrain populated and shaped by dissenters, eccentrics, witch-finders, Puritans, plotlanders and punks. Index entries for Colchester alone include: 1884 earthquake; Castle, witches held in; first civil partnership; Monopoly board; Oyster Feast; plague; suffragettes; Yokohama, trade with. You name it, it went on in Essex.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My fleeting folk memory of Essex is of a grim, midwinter foray to a pet crematorium near Chipping Ongar</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And yes, there is an <a href=\"https://winningmoves.co.uk/products/essex-monopoly\" title=\"\">Essex edition of Monopoly</a>, with the county\u2019s historic houses such as Jacobean Audley End and Layer Marney Tower, Britain\u2019s tallest Tudor gatehouse, up for grabs along with shopping centres and car dealerships. Colchester Castle remains the plum property, priced at \u00a3350. And the 1884 earthquake, which measured 4.6 on the Richter scale, remains Britain\u2019s most destructive tremor, serendipitously begetting, as Darley relates, the <a href=\"https://www.crittall-windows.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Crittall window</a>, the metal framed casement window designed by Frank Crittall that became so emblematic of modernism.</p> <p>Brought up on the Essex/Suffolk borders, architectural historian, critic and campaigner Darley makes a delightfully convivial and knowledgable sherpa. Her command of her multitudinous source material is enviably fluent and always illuminating, from the number of salt pans in Maldon recorded by the Domesday Book to the precise specifications of <a href=\"http://pargettingcompany.com/\" title=\"\">pargetting</a>. It all fairly whirls along in a blizzard of detail, an experience akin to barrelling through Essex lanes in an open-topped sports car while Darley swigs from a hip flask yelling \u201cAsk me anything!\u201d</p> <p>In a more raucous and enjoyable way, she follows the path trod, or rather driven, by that other obsessive observer and compiler <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/aug/07/nikolaus-pevsner-this-life-review\" title=\"\">Nikolaus Pevsner</a>, whose <em><a href=\"https://www.yalebooks.co.uk/results.asp?sort=sort_title&amp;SF1=series_exact&amp;ST1=PEVSNERARCHITECTURALGUIDESBUILDINGSOFENGLAND\" title=\"\">Buildings of England</a></em> remains the definitive, if slightly arid, catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of the nation\u2019s architecture. Yet unlike Darley, Pevsner was not a fan of Essex, arriving there in early 1950s, three years into his gruelling round-England odyssey, towing a caravan borrowed from Hubert de Cronin Hastings, his editor at the <em>Architectural Review</em>. Thus provisioned, he glumly did the rounds, taking in Essex\u2019s Roman remains, its churches, its Martello towers to repel Napoleonic invasion, its factory towns and the oh-so-bracing seaside modernism of Frinton and Clacton. \u201cHe did not warm to it,\u201d Darley drily notes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5f313a3545ccce11d5d4ab05459226855596b559\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f313a3545ccce11d5d4ab05459226855596b559/0_0_4984_3527/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The 15th-century St Clement\u2019s church in West Thurrock\" width=\"1000\" height=\"708\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The 15th-century St Clement\u2019s church in West Thurrock, \u2018framed by the belching shadow of a Procter &amp; Gamble soap factory\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony Watson/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What Pevsner would have made of Quinlan Terry\u2019s Roman Catholic cathedral in Brentwood, completed in 1991, a curious chimera of Italian Renaissance and English baroque motifs, is anyone\u2019s guess. As well as Terry\u2019s classical revivalist pile, Brentwood is also spiritual home to <em>The Only Way Is Essex</em> (the infamous <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/sep/28/towie-itv-transformed-brentwood-essex\" title=\"\">Towie</a></em>), marking, as Darley writes, \u201cone more instance of those strange contradictions and odd bedfellows to which Essex is so cheerfully privy\u201d. Another might be the 15th-century St Clement\u2019s church in West Thurrock framed by the belching hulk of a Procter &amp; Gamble soap plant, a juxtaposition so blatantly cinematic that it earned a spot in <em>Four Weddings and a Funeral</em>, as well as psychogeographic veneration by Iain Sinclair in <em>London Orbital</em>, his paean to the M25.</p> <p>My fleeting folk memory of Essex is more Pevsnarian than Darleyesque, of a grim, midwinter foray to a pet crematorium near Chipping Ongar. It seemed to confirm Essex\u2019s potential for accommodating kitschly macabre rites in the middle of nowhere. Anything could be going on in those outhouses. And as Darley confirms, anything often was. Now a mildly unsettling tourist attraction, the three storey-deep \u201cindestructible\u201d secret nuclear bunker built at <a href=\"https://secretnuclearbunker.com/\" title=\"\">Kelvedon Hatch</a> at the height of cold war hostilities masqueraded on the surface as an \u201cinconspicuous farm cottage with a cosy dormer window in its tiled roof\u201d.

Catastrophic flooding in 1953 killed 114 people in Jaywick and Canvey Island, with 32,000 evacuated.

      "bodyText": "Casually derided for its loud mouth, bad taste and louche, estuarine ways, Essex is the whipping boy of England. Unlike Kent, the garden of England, and Surrey, its patio, Essex is not softened by ersatz pastoralism or laced with gin-and-Jag smugness. Charles Dickens once described Chelmsford, its administrative capital, as \u201cthe dullest and most stupid spot on the face of the earth\u201d. Pinioned by water on one side and London on the other, Essex has a sense of being perpetually under siege from both the sea and the elephantine presence of the metropolis, \u201ca seeping inkblot on the horizon\u201d that over time has greedily gobbled up extremities such as Ilford and Romford. Threats of inundation and invasion have always weighed heavily on the Essex mind, most recently articulated by an unflinching urge to uncouple from Europe. Parsed and pored over by politicians, psephologists and the press, Essex is stubbornly unafraid to make manifest its discontent and go its own cussed way. But as Gillian Darley\u2019s new biography of England\u2019s most maligned and misunderstood county persuasively demonstrates, Essex is more than the crude caricature connoted by referendum statistics. Excellent Essex: In Praise of Britain\u2019s Most Misunderstood County is a richly nuanced billet doux to a terrain populated and shaped by dissenters, eccentrics, witch-finders, Puritans, plotlanders and punks. Index entries for Colchester alone include: 1884 earthquake; Castle, witches held in; first civil partnership; Monopoly board; Oyster Feast; plague; suffragettes; Yokohama, trade with. You name it, it went on in Essex. And yes, there is an Essex edition of Monopoly, with the county\u2019s historic houses such as Jacobean Audley End and Layer Marney Tower, Britain\u2019s tallest Tudor gatehouse, up for grabs along with shopping centres and car dealerships. Colchester Castle remains the plum property, priced at \u00a3350. And the 1884 earthquake, which measured 4.6 on the Richter scale, remains Britain\u2019s most destructive tremor, serendipitously begetting, as Darley relates, the Crittall window, the metal framed casement window designed by Frank Crittall that became so emblematic of modernism. Brought up on the Essex/Suffolk borders, architectural historian, critic and campaigner Darley makes a delightfully convivial and knowledgable sherpa. Her command of her multitudinous source material is enviably fluent and always illuminating, from the number of salt pans in Maldon recorded by the Domesday Book to the precise specifications of pargetting. It all fairly whirls along in a blizzard of detail, an experience akin to barrelling through Essex lanes in an open-topped sports car while Darley swigs from a hip flask yelling \u201cAsk me anything!\u201d In a more raucous and enjoyable way, she follows the path trod, or rather driven, by that other obsessive observer and compiler Nikolaus Pevsner, whose Buildings of England remains the definitive, if slightly arid, catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of the nation\u2019s architecture. Yet unlike Darley, Pevsner was not a fan of Essex, arriving there in early 1950s, three years into his gruelling round-England odyssey, towing a caravan borrowed from Hubert de Cronin Hastings, his editor at the Architectural Review. Thus provisioned, he glumly did the rounds, taking in Essex\u2019s Roman remains, its churches, its Martello towers to repel Napoleonic invasion, its factory towns and the oh-so-bracing seaside modernism of Frinton and Clacton. \u201cHe did not warm to it,\u201d Darley drily notes. What Pevsner would have made of Quinlan Terry\u2019s Roman Catholic cathedral in Brentwood, completed in 1991, a curious chimera of Italian Renaissance and English baroque motifs, is anyone\u2019s guess. As well as Terry\u2019s classical revivalist pile, Brentwood is also spiritual home to The Only Way Is Essex (the infamous Towie), marking, as Darley writes, \u201cone more instance of those strange contradictions and odd bedfellows to which Essex is so cheerfully privy\u201d. Another might be the 15th-century St Clement\u2019s church in West Thurrock framed by the belching hulk of a Procter &amp; Gamble soap plant, a juxtaposition so blatantly cinematic that it earned a spot in Four Weddings and a Funeral, as well as psychogeographic veneration by Iain Sinclair in London Orbital, his paean to the M25. My fleeting folk memory of Essex is more Pevsnarian than Darleyesque, of a grim, midwinter foray to a pet crematorium near Chipping Ongar. It seemed to confirm Essex\u2019s potential for accommodating kitschly macabre rites in the middle of nowhere. Anything could be going on in those outhouses. And as Darley confirms, anything often was. Now a mildly unsettling tourist attraction, the three storey-deep \u201cindestructible\u201d secret nuclear bunker built at Kelvedon Hatch at the height of cold war hostilities masqueraded on the surface as an \u201cinconspicuous farm cottage with a cosy dormer window in its tiled roof\u201d. Decommissioned in 1992, it still pops up in television dramas that require a menacing subterranean locale. Existential dread casts a particularly deep and baleful shadow over Essex. Catastrophic flooding in 1953 killed 114 people in Jaywick and Canvey Island, with 32,000 evacuated. The \u201cthieving sea\u201d still nibbles ominously at a 350-mile coastline that weaves its implausibly intricate way along innumerable estuaries and inlets. Since the Romans tussled with Boudicca, Essex has also been in the front line of foreign invasion, and its coast and countryside are studded with concrete pillboxes and other decaying detritus of defence, such as Maunsell sea forts in the Thames estuary. Originally designed to house anti-aircraft guns, their carious hulks now make for especially salacious ruin porn. During the second world war, Audley End, historically the nearest thing to a palace Essex could muster, was requisitioned as a covert training college for Polish saboteurs, its 17th-century interiors temporarily encased in a protective skin of plywood. After the war, it was suggested this Saffron Walden fastness might become the official residence of the disgraced Duke and Duchess of Windsor, but they quickly found quarters more to their liking in Paris. The less palatial and newly constructed Butlin\u2019s holiday camp at Clacton was also requisitioned as an internment camp for German civilians, while Warner\u2019s at Dovercourt became a reception centre for Jewish children fleeing the Nazis following Kristallnacht. As the East End of London emptied into Essex after the war, its countryside became an energetic incubator of new towns, with their blissful compensations of light, air and indoor sanitation. Basildon, home of \u201cBasildon man\u201d, the cynosure of the Tory working-class voter, was masterplanned by Basil Spence, while in Harlow, Frederick Gibberd designed Britain\u2019s first residential tower block, the 10-storey Lawn. More radically, the development of Essex\u2019s new towns went hand in hand with a new \u201cplate glass\u201d university on the edge of Colchester.

He described his intention behind the architecture as \u201cto do something fierce\u201d, a wish that was unintentionally fulfilled when its brutalist precincts became a crucible for vigorous student protest in the late 60s. Darley\u2019s own odyssey concludes on a more conciliatory note, with a visit to the House for Essex, \u201ca cottage for Rapunzel illustrated by Arthur Rackham\u201d, designed by the architect Charles Holland and artist Grayson Perry, both Essex boys.

Simon Byrne, the chief constable of the PSNI, expressed concern at the \u201ctempo and pace\u201d of attacks and warned that a hard border imposed by a no-deal Brexit could \u201ctrigger\u201d other people to join dissident ranks. \u201cIf we get this wrong we could drift back to almost a paramilitary style of policing,\u201d he said. The gloomy assessment contrasted with the prime minister\u2019s upbeat tone in Berlin and Paris, where he assured his hosts the UK would not impose border checks in the event of a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. There were options, solutions, technologies, he said. Johnson appeared jaunty while resting his foot on a table in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace. Sceptics called it a glossy sham intended to deflect blame if the UK leaves the European Union without a deal, inexorably leading to checks and controls on Northern Ireland\u2019s 300-mile border with the Republic of Ireland. That prospect inspires dread, anger and confusion in Newtownbutler. At the entrance to the village there is an Irish tricolour and a sign showing a map of Ireland with barbed wire separating north and south. \u201cHard border? Soft border? No border! Irish unity now.\u201d The partition of Ireland in 1921 left many in the predominantly nationalist village feeling trapped in an alien state. That sentiment ebbed thanks to the 1998 Good Friday agreement and the European single market. Irish identity was recognised and the border blurred. But the Good Friday agreement is hollowing. Power sharing at Stormont between Sinn F\u00e9in and the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) collapsed in 2017. Northern Ireland has been adrift with no government for almost 1,000 days. Instead of reconciliation, there is rancour and polarisation: mobs clash with police over parades and bonfires, while politicians wrangle over paramilitary displays and Troubles-era killings. Now Brexit \u2013 which most Northern Ireland voters rejected in the 2016 referendum \u2013 risks reviving the border. \u201cThe first customs man who puts his head up, he\u2019s gone. Won\u2019t last the night,\u201d predicted one elderly republican in Newtownbutler, who withheld his name. He had crossed the invisible frontier from his home in County Monaghan, a few miles down the road, for a haircut. Terry Greene, 66, warming a bar stool in Mulligan\u2019s, was emphatic about the impact of a hard border. \u201cI know for a fact the violence will come back,\u201d he said. The prospect so riled him he endorsed the bomb. \u201cIt was a great job. But I\u2019m glad nobody was killed.\u201d Other residents condemned the attack. \u201cA bomb like that, you could be taking someone\u2019s life, which is wrong,\u201d said Martin Taggart, 65. \u201cThey\u2019ll face their maker in heaven if He\u2019s up there.\u201d Emma Gillan, 62, shook her head. A return to violence and a physical, manifest border made no sense, she said. \u201cI\u2019m scared. It\u2019s scary.\u201d Dissident republicans who reject the peace process mounted attacks before Brexit and Stormont\u2019s collapse, killing several members of the security forces. A backstop and restored devolution will not satisfy them. But they see Brexit as a historic opportunity to gain traction. After previous attacks, Sinn F\u00e9in and the DUP set aside their differences to show solidarity \u2013 to show that politics can bridge differences. Not this time. DUP leader Arlene Foster and Sinn F\u00e9in MP Michelle Gildernew, who both represent Fermanagh and South Tyrone, appeared in a joint BBC interview near the bomb scene. The broadcast unravelled when they started arguing over the Troubles-era border. Foster rolled her eyes. Gildernew fumed. \u201cIf senior politicians from the two parties can\u2019t get along together for a few minutes during a live broadcast in the wake of an attack which could have claimed lives, how on earth are they going to govern Northern Ireland?\u201d asked the Belfast Telegraph.",

      "bodyText": "The English Football League has given Bury until Tuesday for their owner, Steve Dale, to conclude a sale or the club will be expelled from the league after 125 years. Dale received a takeover offer in principle on Friday night from the directors of a sporting data and analytics company, C&amp;N Sporting Risk, including Rory Campbell, son of the former Labour party communications director Alastair. In a statement released after the EFL board took time to consider the news yesterday afternoon, the league said it was not prepared to extend the deadline beyond Tuesday at 5pm because of the impact on the season. In a later statement, the EFL also expressed its concern at the continued uncertainty at Bolton, giving the League One club the same deadline. The statement said: \u201cHaving been previously advised in writing on the morning of the start of the season that the deal was all but agreed and only awaiting completion signatures, there has been constant contradictory information and no finalisation of the deal. \u201cThe current situation cannot continue and the time to resolve the current impasse is now fast running out \u2026 If a successful conclusion to a sale is not found or there are no credible plans for the Club to continue the season in administration by the planned Board meeting at 5pm on Tuesday 27 August 2019, then the EFL Board will consider lifting the suspension on the notice of withdrawal of the club\u2019s membership of the League which was issued when the club entered into administration in May 2019.\u201d The EFL has suspended Bury\u2019s first five scheduled matches in League One because of Dale\u2019s failure, since his \u00a31 takeover of the club in December, to provide the evidence required by league rules that he has the funding for the club to meet its commitments. The EFL\u2019s executive chair, Debbie Jevans, emphasised on Thursday that it will already be difficult for those five fixtures to be rescheduled given the crowded calendar of a 24-club division, hence the board\u2019s refusal to allow any further postponement of matches for extended takeover negotiations. In a statement made on Friday night Campbell, 32, and Henry Newman, 30, the directors of C&amp;N Sporting Risk, said they had been in discussions for 10 weeks about buying Bury, but they needed an extension to the midnight deadline because \u201cit is a very complicated scenario and there remain a number of outstanding legal and other issues that have to be addressed\u201d. Having considered that position on Saturday morning, the EFL said in its statement: \u201cThe board has fully considered the information that has been made available by C&amp;N Sporting Risk and, whilst no formal sale has been completed, despite reports to the contrary, enough credible information was presented to allow the board to agree to work exclusively with the club and C&amp;N Sporting Risk over this bank holiday weekend in an attempt to finalise the change of control and achieve a positive outcome for Bury FC. \u201cThe EFL board, however, remains firmly of the view that the League cannot be in a position whereby any more of the club\u2019s 2019-20 fixtures will be suspended due to the integrity of the competition and the impact on other clubs in the League and therefore has stated that matters must be concluded by 5pm on Tuesday 27 August 2019. \u201cIf in the event a successful outcome is not achieved by this point, then Bury FC\u2019s share in the EFL will be withdrawn and its membership in the League will come to an end.\u201d Jevans described this extension of four days over the bank holiday as \u201ca final effort to allow the club the opportunity to survive\u201d. While the extension was welcomed by Bury supporters who had reacted with increasing alarm and distress at the prospect of their club being thrown out of the league and probably folding, the four-day deadline remains challenging and many questions remain. While Campbell, previously a technical scout and analyst at West Ham United, and Newman, a coach and former joint manager of Barnet, said they had been in discussions for 10 weeks, Dale himself had said that until Friday he has had no detailed negotiations with them. As Campbell and Newman made clear, there are layers of complexity and huge problems at Bury, and they must themselves satisfy the EFL they are \u201cfit and proper\u201d to take over, although they are said to have provided proof of funds to the league \u2013 and reassure Bury supporters about their competence, finance and plans. Bury, formed in 1885, are in financial ruins, with a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) needing finance to pay \u201cnon-football creditors\u201d 25p in the pound out of \u00a34m they are owed, around \u00a3750,000 to current and former players and other football creditors, and expected \u00a31.5m losses for the season. Dale has said that a further \u00a31.75m must be paid under the CVA to a company, RCR Holdings Ltd, which bought an apparent \u00a37m debt owed by Bury for \u00a370,000, and now wants a quarter of the full \u00a37m alongside other creditors. RCR Holdings was formed two days before the club\u2019s 18 July creditors meeting at which it voted to pass the CVA, and the sole owner and director, Kris Richards, 41, is Dale\u2019s daughter\u2019s partner. There is also a \u00a33.7m mortgage on Gigg Lane taken out by the former owner Stewart Day, several of whose property companies were about to collapse when he hastily sold the club to Dale for \u00a31 nine months ago. The Bury North MP James Frith, who has worked intensively to find a solution for the club, criticised the EFL for granting so short a time for a deal to complete: \u201cI fear the extension is not long enough with so much still to be done,\u201d he said. \u201cTechnically the EFL have narrowed and shortened the road they might have handed us.

Neither British Airways, the UK\u2019s national carrier, nor American Airlines, the world\u2019s biggest, run schemes.</p> <p>Airlines must report their annual CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, and the industry is aiming to halve its carbon footprint by 2050 by reducing emissions elsewhere.

      "bodyText": "Gope Walker has regularly flown to meet his clients in countries as far apart as Ireland and Argentina. But in 2020 his feet will stay firmly on the ground. Walker, who runs an IT consultancy in Oxford, has pledged to make next year flight free. Instead, he will take advantage of increasingly sophisticated software to hold virtual meetings or will travel within Europe by train. \u201cI just thought, this is something I can do. We should all be asking \u2018do I really need to go there?\u2019 From a business point of view, I honestly can\u2019t see why I do,\u201d he said. Next week, Alexandra Jellicoe will return to the UK from a family holiday in Annecy in the French Alps. She and her three children under seven will take the train to Paris, and from there to London before the final leg to her home near Bath. The journey will take about 10 hours, but \u201ctrains are very child-friendly, you meet other people and you get to see more,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re concerned about the environment, one of the biggest things you can do personally is not fly.\u201d The damage caused to the environment by carbon dioxide emitted from aircraft \u2013 and the dilemma facing those who want to reduce their carbon footprint but also want to travel \u2013 was highlighted last week by a row over the Duke and Duchess of Sussex using private jets. The couple, who have spoken out about the climate crisis \u2013 even publicly saying they will only have two children because of their concerns for the planet \u2013 were accused of hypocrisy. Elton John, who invited Harry, Meghan and baby Archie to stay at his home in the south of France, defended booking a 12-seat Cessna, citing the need for security and privacy. But the journey was estimated to have emitted seven times more CO2 per person than a commercial flight. Piling on the Sussexes\u2019 discomfort was the emergence at the end of the week of pictures of his brother, William, disembarking with his wife and children from a low-cost commercial flight from Norwich to Aberdeen. Budget airlines are more carbon efficient per person because their flights tend to be fully booked. John said he ensured the Sussexes\u2019 flight was carbon neutral by making an \u201cappropriate contribution\u201d to Carbon Footprint, a consultancy that helps reduce and offset emissions. The company declined to comment on Harry and Meghan\u2019s trip but told the Observer: \u201cCarbon offsetting is an option for mitigating the effects of carbon impact.\u201d Not everyone agrees. \u201cThe term is misleading \u2013 it implies you can equalise the emissions and fly carbon neutral,\u201d said Roger Tyers, a research fellow at the University of Southampton. \u201cBasically, you emit carbon today and even the best offset won\u2019t repay that debt for many years, by which time a lot more damage has been done.\u201d According to the UN, offsets \u201crisk giving the dangerous illusion of a \u2018fix\u2019 that will allow our billowing emissions to just continue to grow\u201d. While offsetting can be a useful temporary measure, \u201cit is not a silver bullet and the danger is that it can lead to complacency,\u201d said Niklas Hagelberg, a UN climate specialist. The problem is compounded by carbon calculators producing varying data on the amount of CO2 emitted by any particular journey, and by disagreement over the effectiveness of hundreds of schemes \u2013 such as reforesting, hydroelectrics and solar energy \u2013 into which money is invested. In any case, a recent survey by the BBC found that only half the world\u2019s biggest airlines offer carbon offsetting to their customers \u2013 and only 1% of flyers choose to pay the extra. Neither British Airways, the UK\u2019s national carrier, nor American Airlines, the world\u2019s biggest, run schemes. Airlines must report their annual CO2 emissions, and the industry is aiming to halve its carbon footprint by 2050 by reducing emissions elsewhere. With nearly 4.4 billion passengers taking to the air last year and global aviation CO2 emissions at almost 900m tonnes, the challenge is immense. Nevertheless, consumer consciousness is rising, helped by the Extinction Rebellion campaign, the environmental activist Greta Thunberg\u2019s zero-emission boat journey across the Atlantic, and the growing phenomenon of flygskam \u2013 the Swedish word for flight-shaming. The latter is credited with an 8% drop in the number of passengers flying from Swedish airports between January and April this year. Meanwhile, France is introducing an \u201ceco-tax\u201d of up to \u20ac18 on flights from its airports, and the Dutch carrier KLM has launched a \u201cfly responsibly\u201d campaign, even suggesting train journeys instead of short-haul flights. In the UK \u2013 where a third runway is planned for Heathrow despite the airport already being the biggest single source of CO2 emissions in the country \u2013 environmental activists are urging people to commit to a flight-free 2020. \u201cWe accept air travel is part of society and we\u2019re not saying never fly again. We\u2019re trying to start a conversation about how to reduce our carbon footprint,\u201d said Anna Hughes of Flight Free UK.

We need a foreign policy based on long-term UK interests and a strong economy, and that requires close relationships with our European neighbours. \u201cNo deal represents the biggest unilateral abandonment of those interests in modern British history. It should not be allowed to happen. We hope the prime minister uses this G7 meeting to signal a different approach.\u201d The intervention came after the Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, confirmed the UK would not nominate a new candidate for the role of EU commissioner, as other members states in the bloc considered who to nominate. He said: \u201cWe are leaving the EU on 31 October. As a departing member state we will not be involved in the new commission so it would be a distraction to nominate a new commissioner.\u201d On Friday, the prime minister played down hopes of an early breakthrough in talks with the EU over the Brexit deal. Johnson told reporters during a visit to Devon: \u201cI\u2019m afraid we will have to prepare to come out without an agreement and we can do that. We are very confident that we will be OK because we will have all sorts of preparations in place. \u201cWe are making progress but I am just telling people not to hold their breath, because I have seen the way these Brussels negotiations work. \u201cI must urge people \u2013 we are going to be working very hard on this but they shouldn\u2019t necessarily get their hopes up too soon.\u201d Later, in remarks released before the G7 summit, Johnson said the UK would continue to be an \u201cenergetic partner\u201d to its international allies after Brexit. \u201cThe Britain I lead will be an international, outward-looking, self-confident nation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will be an energetic partner on the world stage. We will stand alongside our G7 allies to solve the most pressing international issues.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Iwan Carrington wanted AirPods but he couldn\u2019t afford them, and for most 16-year-old boys that\u2019s where the story would end. Since their release in December 2016, Apple\u2019s \u00a3199 wireless Bluetooth earbuds have become a status symbol among teens: after all, only the wealthy can afford tiny, untethered headphones that are so easy to lose. As an ordinary Welsh schoolboy, Carrington wasn\u2019t rich enough to buy them, and he was growing increasingly jealous of his friend\u2019s pair. So in January this year, he came up with a solution.</p> <p>With just a few clicks on his computer, Carrington <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/i-am-deaperate-for-airpods-help-a-brither-out\" title=\"\">created a page</a> on the crowdfunding website GoFundMe, set a fundraising goal of \u00a3100 (he had saved the rest from Christmas), and titled it simply and honestly: \u201cI am desperate for AirPods. Help a brother out.\u201d The plea was simple and unvarnished: \u201cI am like any other teenager except I would love some Apple AirPods. I was sat on the bus untangling my earphone wires and thought how great it would be to have AirPods. I ask for any help. Please.\u201d The first comment underneath was similarly direct: \u201cThis is a shameless act of self-promotion. I totally support it.\u201d Eight donors and a few days later, Carrington had raised the money he needed.</p> <p>For close to a decade, GoFundMe has allowed ordinary people to crowdfund their needs, ranging from medical bills to tuition fees to emergency expenses. As the internet\u2019s largest crowdfunding platform, the site has raised more than $7bn since 2010, with one-third of all donations <a href=\"https://time.com/5516037/gofundme-medical-bills-one-third-ceo/\" title=\"\">going towards people\u2019s health</a><a href=\"https://time.com/5516037/gofundme-medical-bills-one-third-ceo/\" title=\"\">care costs</a>. Yet while the site helps many in times of crisis, it increasingly hosts a vast number of campaigns that are less about people in need and more about \u201cpeople in want\u201d.</p> <p>I rang Carrington to ask if he felt cheeky requesting money from friends, family and strangers online \u2013 after creating the page, he shared it on social media and via email. \u201cAt the start, yeah,\u201d he says. \u201cBut when I actually got my AirPods I thought, \u2018Never mind, I like this.\u2019\u201d He had already checked the site to see if other people had run similar campaigns, and knew he wasn\u2019t the first; at the time of writing, GoFundMe had 4,649 results for the search term \u201cAirPods\u201d. \u201cIt made me feel comfortable doing it.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The means by which we can solicit and donate cash or gifts have grown increasingly imaginative</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Carrington adds that the people who donated were mainly businessmen and women \u2013 family friends \u2013 who could afford to. \u201cI don\u2019t feel guilty because they\u2019re not exactly poor \u2013 they weren\u2019t giving away their life savings.\u201d His mother, Abi Jenkins, who is 36 and works in the travel industry, tells me she didn\u2019t know about her son\u2019s plan until she got the email inviting her to donate. Was she embarrassed? \u201cI initially thought it was a bit cheeky. But at the same time I thought, I\u2019ve always encouraged the children to be entrepreneurial.\u201d</p> <p>In recent years, there has been a distinct cultural and psychological shift when it comes to crowdfunding. Where once only those with the saddest stories and the rarest illnesses felt comfortable asking the internet for money, there are now endless campaigns for endless causes. When I looked on GoFundMe there were 675 results for \u201cboob job\u201d, 5,209 for \u201cXbox\u201d, and 47 people looking to raise the cash for \u201cLouis Vuitton bag\u201d. \u201cEver since I was a pre-teen my wish has been to own a designer handbag,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/help-isabel-buy-her-first-louis-vuitton-bag\" title=\"\">reads </a><a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/help-isabel-buy-her-first-louis-vuitton-bag\" title=\"\">one </a><a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/help-isabel-buy-her-first-louis-vuitton-bag\" title=\"\">page</a>. But not every post flies: in four months, the Louis Vuitton request has raised just $150 of its $1,000 goal.</p> <p>There are thousands of similar campaigns stuck at the \u00a30 mark. No one has yet coughed up a penny of the \u00a3300,000 required to <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/get-dan-a-lamborghini\" title=\"\">\u201cGet Dan a Lamborghini\u201d</a>, despite the promised free ride. Yet requests like Carrington\u2019s \u2013 those that are honest, funny and realistic \u2013 are becoming increasingly successful. A Scot has so far raised \u00a322,827 to \u201chelp\u201d his new cat Nala <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/c9ec8-nala039s-travels\" title=\"\">travel the world</a> on the front of his bike. His goal was \u00a36,000. Over the course of 12 hours in June, <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/9kxve5/who-the-hell-spat-on-eric-trump-maybe-not-the-lady-who-raised-dollar5k-from-gofundme\" title=\"\">more than $5,000</a> was raised for a waitress who claimed she had been fired after spitting on Donald Trump\u2019s son, Eric. That same month, donors raised \u00a359,000 to pay the legal fees of a London cyclist who had collided with a woman who was looking at her phone while crossing the road. More than 4,000 people donated via a <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-cover-rob-hazeldean039s-legal-fees\" title=\"\">page set up by his friend</a>, raising more than double the requested sum, even though the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/21/cyclist-crashed-into-woman-mobile-phone-pay-compensation-london\" title=\"\">judge ruled both parties </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/21/cyclist-crashed-into-woman-mobile-phone-pay-compensation-london\" title=\"\">equally responsible</a> for the accident. </p> <p>From bankrolling new products on Kickstarter to supporting artists with a monthly donation via Patreon, there is now a platform for everything (the Guardian has been asking readers for donations since 2016). <a href=\"https://www.ko-fi.com/\" title=\"\">Ko-fi</a> allows \u201call kinds of creators\u201d to ask people to support their work by donating the price of a coffee; OnlyFans is popular with models and sex workers, who can share videos and pictures for cash; <a href=\"https://unbound.com/\" title=\"\">Unbound</a> enables readers to back a book before it\u2019s published. Crowdfunding has its dark side, too: from 2017 to 2018, Hatreon enabled white supremacists to make a living from their hate speech. The site took $25,000 a month in donations before Visa suspended its services.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"bc934daaff5fd05c688f2fa0399b82e4483dafa6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc934daaff5fd05c688f2fa0399b82e4483dafa6/140_264_513_641/400.jpg\" alt=\"Iwan Carrington (above) turned to GoFundMe when he couldn\u2019t afford to buy wireless earbuds.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Iwan Carrington (above) turned to GoFundMe when he couldn\u2019t afford to buy wireless earbuds.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abi Jenkins</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The means by which we can solicit and donate cash or gifts have grown increasingly imaginative. People can remotely send one another pints (or portions of peas) via an app created by the Wetherspoon\u2019s pub chain: you post your table number and pub name, and let friends or strangers send you gifts from the bar or kitchen. You\u2019ll be hard-pressed to find a viral tweet that isn\u2019t followed up with a cheeky link to the tweeter\u2019s Cash App, Amazon Wishlist or PayPal. An Uber driver who <a href=\"https://twitter.com/teejus___/status/967554582401478656?lang=en\" title=\"\">shared the playlists he created for customers</a> in 2018 earned over 200,000 likes on Twitter, and followed up by asking his new fans to \u201csend me $5\u201d (online magazine Slate has dubbed this <a href=\"https://slate.com/technology/2018/04/people-have-started-twitter-invoicing-after-their-tweets-go-viral.html\" title=\"\">\u201cthe Twitter Invoice\u201d</a>).</p> <p>When did asking strangers for money stop being embarrassing? Elizabeth Gerber, a professor at Northwestern University, Illinois, who has been studying crowdfunding for more than 10 years, argues that today\u2019s shift can be attributed to two technological changes: the increasing ease with which we can safely transfer money online; and the ability we now have to reach anyone on the internet. \u201cThere\u2019s an increased comfort with giving money online, and consequently, the comfort with asking has increased as well,\u201d she explains. \u201cAs it becomes more and more normalised, people feel able to ask anyone for anything.\u201d</p> <p>Gerber\u2019s research has found that people like to make charitable donations online because their name becomes visibly associated with a cause; on many crowdfunding sites, donors are listed down the righthand side of the campaign page. She adds that for all requests people tend to dip into their spare cash, money they\u2019d typically use for leisure activities. \u201cThey\u2019re donating money they\u2019d normally use to go to the movies or a concert,\u201d she says, noting that crowdfunding pages like Carrington\u2019s provide their own form of entertainment in return for cash.</p> <p>There are social as well as technological factors driving the boom in online giving and receiving. Gerber notes that, in a world where social media has taught us to exchange likes and comments, it is almost natural that we should begin exchanging money, too. \u201cIf you post something on Facebook and somebody likes it, there\u2019s a pressure to respond \u2013 and that pressure has increased over time.\u201d She says that people tend to give reciprocally, sometimes donating the exact amounts they have received from friends.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In the face of budget cuts, British schools are now using Amazon Wishlists to crowdfund their classroom needs</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Crowdfunding is nothing new. The <a href=\"https://historydaily.org/how-1885-crowdsourcing-saved-the-statue-of-liberty\" title=\"\">plinth for the Statue of Liberty was paid for by </a><a href=\"https://historydaily.org/how-1885-crowdsourcing-saved-the-statue-of-liberty\" title=\"\">160,000 donors in the 1880s</a>, and we have collectively donated towards non-necessities like weddings for centuries. The digital revolution began in 2000, when solicitor Zarine Kharas approached Belgian businesswoman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/women-in-leadership/women-leadership-blog/2014/oct/24/anne-marie-huby-interview-founder-justgiving\" title=\"\">Anne-Marie Huby</a>, head of the UK arm of M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, and launched JustGiving, a platform that allowed anyone to raise money for charitable causes. The website now gives users two options: you can \u201cfundraise\u201d for a charity, or \u201ccrowdfund\u201d for personal causes.</p> <p>Although the website remains far more charity-oriented than many other crowdfunding sites (results on searching \u201cAirPods\u201d: five), both the user and the consumer have changed significantly over the past 19 years, according to JustGiving\u2019s UK general manager, Keith Williams. \u201cIt\u2019s more social, more personal,\u201d he says, explaining that a crowdfunding page for a personal cause can reach its target<strong> </strong>in 30-33 days, while fundraising for charity often takes longer, at more than 100 days. \u201cIt\u2019s super-fast, super-viral,\u201d he says of the personal campaigns. \u201cThey have four times more shares [than the charity requests], and the pages raise between 20 and 30% more.\u201d</p> <p>Personal stories are at the heart of modern crowdfunding; since the early noughties, the language of need and necessities has been usurped by the language of hopes, dreams and desires. Take the man who raised more than \u00a320,000 to travel with his cat. \u201cThrough Montenegro we explored abandoned villas and hidden beaches, with Nala on my shoulder through the good and the bad,\u201d he wrote on his page. There are now 1,235 results for \u201cbackpacking\u201d on GoFundMe, with headlines like \u201cHelp me chase my dreams\u201d or \u201cBeing a backpacker is amazing but it is very expensive\u201d.</p> <p>The launch of JustGiving inspired a number of other crowdfunding sites that were geared more towards creativity, rather than charity. In 2001, <a href=\"http://www.artistshare.com/about\" title=\"\">ArtistShare</a> began allowing fans to finance musicians\u2019 projects; in 2008 and 2009, <a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/\" title=\"\">IndieGoGo</a> and Kickstarter, respectively, enabled ordinary people to fund their passion projects, launching their own businesses, products and services. These websites developed rewards-based models, whereby donors essentially became investors: months after their donation, they might receive an album or a new smartwatch in the post.</p> <p>When GoFundMe launched in 2010, it was the first mainstream service that didn\u2019t require users to meet their funding goals in order to cash in their money, encouraging more people to solicit for more things. And without feeling the pressure to help a project reach its goals, donors could also give smaller amounts in a more spontaneous way.</p> <p>According to John Coventry, Europe and Australia director at GoFundMe, crowdfunding has moved beyond its utilitarian phase and evolved into an act of solidarity and support. (He adds that the UK is GoFundMe\u2019s fastest-growing market outside the US.) What Coventry describes as earlier \u201cmedical, memorial and emergency\u201d campaigns have paved the way for a more social form of giving. He cites the success of a 2017 campaign for a <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/9wvxt9-replacement-window\" title=\"\">replacement window in a student house</a>, which raised \u00a32,835 \u2013 10 times the desired amount. The reason the window needed replacing? A student who had gone back to the house on a date had panicked on finding that the toilet wouldn\u2019t flush and had thrown a poo, wrapped in toilet paper, out of the window. It had landed between two panes of glass, which eventually had to be smashed by the fire brigade in order to free the student who had attempted to retrieve the poo.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"925f656b5b62e60c85a57d71572d9f6e9b4980eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/925f656b5b62e60c85a57d71572d9f6e9b4980eb/0_53_920_552/500.jpg\" alt=\"When cyclist Robert Hazeldean (above) was involved in an accident, a friend crowdfunded to cover his legal fees.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">When cyclist Robert Hazeldean (above) was involved in an accident, a friend crowdfunded to cover his legal fees.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brittany Maher-Kirk/GoFundMe</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Coventry believes that as people became used to receiving GoFundMe requests, they stopped being embarrassed about creating their own \u2013 in much the same way, he says, that you might have been nervous the first time you ordered an Uber, and now it\u2019s part of your everyday life. \u201cThe internet has given tools that were only available to big companies or governments and put them in the hands of people,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The normalisation of crowdfunding can be related to wider global trends, from the 2008 economic recession to austerity politics and David Cameron\u2019s notion of the \u201cbig society\u201d, one in which volunteers filled the role of the state.

Jenny Rogers, headteacher at Copmanthorpe primary school in York, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/hz/wishlist/ls/Q3DUX6LKC0V6?ref_=wl_share\" title=\"\">set up an Amazon Wishlist</a> to bulk up the school\u2019s library; on the day before we speak, the school was gifted an entire set of Harry Potter novels by a parent. \u201cI\u2019ve been a headteacher for nine years and budgets have become even tighter,\u201d Rogers says. \u201cBooks and things that we should be able to afford are now almost a luxury.\u201d</p> <p>You could argue that ordering books via Amazon is only marginally different from handing over 50p in the hope of winning the raffle\u2019s finest bottle of bubble bath at the school fete. But one significant change has been at university level, where online crowdfunding moved from a \u201cneeds\u201d- to a \u201cwants\u201d-based model in the late 2000s. In 2012, GoFundMe co-founder <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/photo-essays/2012-02-01/moneymaking-ideas\" title=\"\">Brad Damphousse told Bloomberg Businessweek</a> that university students were increasingly using his site to pay their tuition costs, including for opportunities to study abroad.</p> <p>Because a master\u2019s degree is not usually seen to be as much of a necessity as pencils for 10-year-olds, good storytelling tended to predicate a crowdfunder\u2019s success. As a creative writing student, Lulu Jemimah knows how to structure a narrative. In 2017, the 32-year-old Ugandan was accepted on to Oxford University\u2019s creative writing master\u2019s programme; unable to find the fees herself, she successfully crowdfunded the first year of her tuition. In 2018, after attempting and failing to earn the money for her second year, Jemimah decided to marry herself.</p> <p>\u201cI felt really embarrassed to do a second crowdfunding,\u201d Jemimah says now. \u201cSo I thought I could use my wedding as a story.\u201d Frustrated that relatives and family friends were unimpressed with her studies and instead repeatedly asked her when she would marry and have children, Jemimah hired a wedding gown, asked her brother to bake a cake, and married herself on her 32nd birthday in August 2018. Two months later, she used footage from the day to <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/kzysnz-this-is-my-love-story\" title=\"\">crowdfund the second year of her master\u2019s</a>. \u201cThis is my love story,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI got married to the one person I am certain will take care of me.\u201d She described seeing snow for the first time, and sleeping in the college library. \u201cI thought people were going to ridicule me, but then it got picked up,\u201d she says.</p> <p>In total, Jemimah\u2019s two crowdfunding efforts raised \u00a323,937 from 448 people. \u201cPeople were apologetic, which I found really strange, like \u2018Sorry, I only have \u00a320\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cI was just overwhelmed by the support.\u201d But there were angry messages, too, from people who felt Jemimah should have earned the money herself. \u201cYou almost have to struggle to remember the positive comments,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause I would read a negative comment and my whole day would be ruined.\u201d</p> <p>In February this year, an Edinburgh couple were told to \u201cget a job\u201d and \u201cstop scrounging\u201d by angry commenters after they started a GoFundMe to raise \u00a34,500 for their wedding. In June, a German influencer couple who asked for <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/ts7s93-another-beautiful-day\" title=\"\">\u20ac10,000 to fund their tandem cycle to Africa</a> found their social media accounts flooded with posts calling them \u201cnarcissists\u201d, \u201cdouchebags\u201d and \u201centitled\u201d. (They had half-anticipated this, writing in their original Facebook post: \u201cSome will tell us to get jobs like everyone else, and stop begging. But when you have the impact we do on others\u2019 life, getting a job is not an option.\u201d)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A woman in London wants a new hamster cage for her 'lovely ball of fur', Mozzarella</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For many people who have benefited from crowdfunding, free money isn\u2019t always as free as it seems. \u201cThere is a lot of guilt,\u201d says Jemimah. \u201cSometimes when I want to watch a movie I think, \u2018No, you have to be focusing on your work.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Mollie Goodfellow, a 26-year-old comedy writer and popular Twitter personality, admits that she felt embarrassed after receiving gifts when she shared an Amazon Wishlist with her 32,000 followers. (The page had been set up for family and friends, but after Goodfellow tweeted it once, she started <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hansmollman/status/1149279860931596288\" title=\"\">receiving books from strangers</a>.) \u201cIt made me feel really conflicted,\u201d she tells me. \u201cObviously I was grateful and touched, but I felt guilty that they would spend their money on me when all I really do is write dumb tweets.\u201d</p> <p>Gerber points out that giving isn\u2019t always as altruistic as it seems. \u201cThe hope is that if you back somebody else who has a big network, they will share your project with their network. So you\u2019re paying for access,\u201d she says. This becomes problematic when we foster online \u201cparasocial relationships\u201d \u2013 relationships in which one person feels close to a high-profile individual who isn\u2019t aware they exist. The personal stories shared on crowdfunding sites can make donors feel they know a stranger when, in reality, they aren\u2019t who they seem to be.</p> <p>In July this year, Henry (not his real name), a 29-year-old copy editor from Boston, donated $50 via the digital wallet app <a href=\"https://venmo.com/\" title=\"\">Venmo</a> to a low-profile comedian who posted on Twitter that he was depressed and suicidal. \u201cI decided to donate because he seemed like he was going through a really hard time,\u201d Henry says. Days later, the comedian was accused of sexual harassment and abuse by two women, leading to further rumours that he used the crowdfunded money to buy drugs.</p> <p>\u201cI felt gullible, but mostly I was upset on behalf of his victims and hoping that the money I gave him didn\u2019t perpetuate his addictions and lead to him hurting anybody,\u201d Henry says now. Crowdfunding is now so ubiquitous that the solution was simple \u2013 Henry went on to donate to the women who had accused the comedian of abuse, after they tweeted links to fundraising pages.</p> <p>Ultimately, of course, it is up to donors how they choose to spend their money \u2013 and often they have no expectations of a return on their investment. Philadelphia-based project manager <a href=\"https://uk.gofundme.com/matt039s-50th-birthday-party\" title=\"\">Matt Black crowdfunded his Halloween and </a><a href=\"https://uk.gofundme.com/matt039s-50th-birthday-party\" title=\"\">Day of the Dead-themed 50th birthday party</a> last year, and says he had no complaints. He had not seen anyone else use GoFundMe to throw a party, but had used the site to donate to a friend who was struggling to make his mortgage payments. Inspired by that example, he made his request as candid as possible. \u201cOkay, I know that GoFundMe campaigns are usually for charity or worthy causes, and it could seem egotistical and selfish to crowdfund my own birthday party, but... ,\u201d Black wrote, before explaining that he wanted a \u201ccelebration of life\u201d in lieu of presents. \u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018Woe is me, feel sorry for me, I can\u2019t afford this or that,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cThis is a party for me and my friends, and I chose it to be a relatively expensive event.\u201d He raised $940 of his $1,500 goal from friends, hired his favourite band, rented a room in his local bar, and encouraged his guests to wear costumes. Not everyone who donated turned up; Black says people used their gift as a way to apologise for not being able to make the event.</p> <p>Every day, across all the various fundraising platforms, the requests keep coming: often hitting that sweet spot between incredibly mundane and genuinely unusual. \u201cI want to dye my hair blond, please help a gal out,\u201d reads one, from a woman in Ireland, posted on 11 August. \u201cI\u2019m 20 years old and I want my first car to be a Mercedes-Benz,\u201d says another, posted in June. A woman in London wants a new hamster cage for her \u201clovely ball of fur\u201d, Mozzarella. A man in the West Midlands wants \u00a3500 for his stag do. A college student in Wraysbury, Surrey, needs to pay off his parking ticket. Many of these people might not earn a penny from strangers on the internet, but what they\u2019re doing is no longer seen as strange.</p> <p>A man from Ohio has set up a GoFundMe page for a preemptive emergency fund \u2013 a just-in-case pot. \u201cI\u2019m setting this up to help with any legal/medical/repair debts that are inevitably going to happen,\u201d he wrote, setting his target at $10,000. \u201cWhy not? I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve donated to dumber causes.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email <a href=\"mailto:\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

      "bodyText": "Iwan Carrington wanted AirPods but he couldn\u2019t afford them, and for most 16-year-old boys that\u2019s where the story would end. Since their release in December 2016, Apple\u2019s \u00a3199 wireless Bluetooth earbuds have become a status symbol among teens: after all, only the wealthy can afford tiny, untethered headphones that are so easy to lose. As an ordinary Welsh schoolboy, Carrington wasn\u2019t rich enough to buy them, and he was growing increasingly jealous of his friend\u2019s pair. So in January this year, he came up with a solution. With just a few clicks on his computer, Carrington created a page on the crowdfunding website GoFundMe, set a fundraising goal of \u00a3100 (he had saved the rest from Christmas), and titled it simply and honestly: \u201cI am desperate for AirPods. Help a brother out.\u201d The plea was simple and unvarnished: \u201cI am like any other teenager except I would love some Apple AirPods. I was sat on the bus untangling my earphone wires and thought how great it would be to have AirPods. I ask for any help. Please.\u201d The first comment underneath was similarly direct: \u201cThis is a shameless act of self-promotion. I totally support it.\u201d Eight donors and a few days later, Carrington had raised the money he needed. For close to a decade, GoFundMe has allowed ordinary people to crowdfund their needs, ranging from medical bills to tuition fees to emergency expenses. As the internet\u2019s largest crowdfunding platform, the site has raised more than $7bn since 2010, with one-third of all donations going towards people\u2019s healthcare costs. Yet while the site helps many in times of crisis, it increasingly hosts a vast number of campaigns that are less about people in need and more about \u201cpeople in want\u201d. I rang Carrington to ask if he felt cheeky requesting money from friends, family and strangers online \u2013 after creating the page, he shared it on social media and via email. \u201cAt the start, yeah,\u201d he says. \u201cBut when I actually got my AirPods I thought, \u2018Never mind, I like this.\u2019\u201d He had already checked the site to see if other people had run similar campaigns, and knew he wasn\u2019t the first; at the time of writing, GoFundMe had 4,649 results for the search term \u201cAirPods\u201d. \u201cIt made me feel comfortable doing it.\u201d Carrington adds that the people who donated were mainly businessmen and women \u2013 family friends \u2013 who could afford to. \u201cI don\u2019t feel guilty because they\u2019re not exactly poor \u2013 they weren\u2019t giving away their life savings.\u201d His mother, Abi Jenkins, who is 36 and works in the travel industry, tells me she didn\u2019t know about her son\u2019s plan until she got the email inviting her to donate. Was she embarrassed? \u201cI initially thought it was a bit cheeky. But at the same time I thought, I\u2019ve always encouraged the children to be entrepreneurial.\u201d In recent years, there has been a distinct cultural and psychological shift when it comes to crowdfunding. Where once only those with the saddest stories and the rarest illnesses felt comfortable asking the internet for money, there are now endless campaigns for endless causes. When I looked on GoFundMe there were 675 results for \u201cboob job\u201d, 5,209 for \u201cXbox\u201d, and 47 people looking to raise the cash for \u201cLouis Vuitton bag\u201d. \u201cEver since I was a pre-teen my wish has been to own a designer handbag,\u201d reads one page. But not every post flies: in four months, the Louis Vuitton request has raised just $150 of its $1,000 goal. There are thousands of similar campaigns stuck at the \u00a30 mark. No one has yet coughed up a penny of the \u00a3300,000 required to \u201cGet Dan a Lamborghini\u201d, despite the promised free ride. Yet requests like Carrington\u2019s \u2013 those that are honest, funny and realistic \u2013 are becoming increasingly successful. A Scot has so far raised \u00a322,827 to \u201chelp\u201d his new cat Nala travel the world on the front of his bike. His goal was \u00a36,000. Over the course of 12 hours in June, more than $5,000 was raised for a waitress who claimed she had been fired after spitting on Donald Trump\u2019s son, Eric. That same month, donors raised \u00a359,000 to pay the legal fees of a London cyclist who had collided with a woman who was looking at her phone while crossing the road. More than 4,000 people donated via a page set up by his friend, raising more than double the requested sum, even though the judge ruled both parties equally responsible for the accident. From bankrolling new products on Kickstarter to supporting artists with a monthly donation via Patreon, there is now a platform for everything (the Guardian has been asking readers for donations since 2016). Ko-fi allows \u201call kinds of creators\u201d to ask people to support their work by donating the price of a coffee; OnlyFans is popular with models and sex workers, who can share videos and pictures for cash; Unbound enables readers to back a book before it\u2019s published. Crowdfunding has its dark side, too: from 2017 to 2018, Hatreon enabled white supremacists to make a living from their hate speech. The site took $25,000 a month in donations before Visa suspended its services. The means by which we can solicit and donate cash or gifts have grown increasingly imaginative. People can remotely send one another pints (or portions of peas) via an app created by the Wetherspoon\u2019s pub chain: you post your table number and pub name, and let friends or strangers send you gifts from the bar or kitchen. You\u2019ll be hard-pressed to find a viral tweet that isn\u2019t followed up with a cheeky link to the tweeter\u2019s Cash App, Amazon Wishlist or PayPal. An Uber driver who shared the playlists he created for customers in 2018 earned over 200,000 likes on Twitter, and followed up by asking his new fans to \u201csend me $5\u201d (online magazine Slate has dubbed this \u201cthe Twitter Invoice\u201d). When did asking strangers for money stop being embarrassing? Elizabeth Gerber, a professor at Northwestern University, Illinois, who has been studying crowdfunding for more than 10 years, argues that today\u2019s shift can be attributed to two technological changes: the increasing ease with which we can safely transfer money online; and the ability we now have to reach anyone on the internet. \u201cThere\u2019s an increased comfort with giving money online, and consequently, the comfort with asking has increased as well,\u201d she explains. \u201cAs it becomes more and more normalised, people feel able to ask anyone for anything.\u201d Gerber\u2019s research has found that people like to make charitable donations online because their name becomes visibly associated with a cause; on many crowdfunding sites, donors are listed down the righthand side of the campaign page. She adds that for all requests people tend to dip into their spare cash, money they\u2019d typically use for leisure activities. \u201cThey\u2019re donating money they\u2019d normally use to go to the movies or a concert,\u201d she says, noting that crowdfunding pages like Carrington\u2019s provide their own form of entertainment in return for cash. There are social as well as technological factors driving the boom in online giving and receiving. Gerber notes that, in a world where social media has taught us to exchange likes and comments, it is almost natural that we should begin exchanging money, too. \u201cIf you post something on Facebook and somebody likes it, there\u2019s a pressure to respond \u2013 and that pressure has increased over time.\u201d She says that people tend to give reciprocally, sometimes donating the exact amounts they have received from friends. Crowdfunding is nothing new. The plinth for the Statue of Liberty was paid for by 160,000 donors in the 1880s, and we have collectively donated towards non-necessities like weddings for centuries. The digital revolution began in 2000, when solicitor Zarine Kharas approached Belgian businesswoman Anne-Marie Huby, head of the UK arm of M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, and launched JustGiving, a platform that allowed anyone to raise money for charitable causes. The website now gives users two options: you can \u201cfundraise\u201d for a charity, or \u201ccrowdfund\u201d for personal causes. Although the website remains far more charity-oriented than many other crowdfunding sites (results on searching \u201cAirPods\u201d: five), both the user and the consumer have changed significantly over the past 19 years, according to JustGiving\u2019s UK general manager, Keith Williams. \u201cIt\u2019s more social, more personal,\u201d he says, explaining that a crowdfunding page for a personal cause can reach its target in 30-33 days, while fundraising for charity often takes longer, at more than 100 days. \u201cIt\u2019s super-fast, super-viral,\u201d he says of the personal campaigns. \u201cThey have four times more shares [than the charity requests], and the pages raise between 20 and 30% more.\u201d Personal stories are at the heart of modern crowdfunding; since the early noughties, the language of need and necessities has been usurped by the language of hopes, dreams and desires. Take the man who raised more than \u00a320,000 to travel with his cat. \u201cThrough Montenegro we explored abandoned villas and hidden beaches, with Nala on my shoulder through the good and the bad,\u201d he wrote on his page. There are now 1,235 results for \u201cbackpacking\u201d on GoFundMe, with headlines like \u201cHelp me chase my dreams\u201d or \u201cBeing a backpacker is amazing but it is very expensive\u201d. The launch of JustGiving inspired a number of other crowdfunding sites that were geared more towards creativity, rather than charity. In 2001, ArtistShare began allowing fans to finance musicians\u2019 projects; in 2008 and 2009, IndieGoGo and Kickstarter, respectively, enabled ordinary people to fund their passion projects, launching their own businesses, products and services. These websites developed rewards-based models, whereby donors essentially became investors: months after their donation, they might receive an album or a new smartwatch in the post. When GoFundMe launched in 2010, it was the first mainstream service that didn\u2019t require users to meet their funding goals in order to cash in their money, encouraging more people to solicit for more things. And without feeling the pressure to help a project reach its goals, donors could also give smaller amounts in a more spontaneous way. According to John Coventry, Europe and Australia director at GoFundMe, crowdfunding has moved beyond its utilitarian phase and evolved into an act of solidarity and support. (He adds that the UK is GoFundMe\u2019s fastest-growing market outside the US.) What Coventry describes as earlier \u201cmedical, memorial and emergency\u201d campaigns have paved the way for a more social form of giving. He cites the success of a 2017 campaign for a replacement window in a student house, which raised \u00a32,835 \u2013 10 times the desired amount. The reason the window needed replacing? A student who had gone back to the house on a date had panicked on finding that the toilet wouldn\u2019t flush and had thrown a poo, wrapped in toilet paper, out of the window. It had landed between two panes of glass, which eventually had to be smashed by the fire brigade in order to free the student who had attempted to retrieve the poo. Coventry believes that as people became used to receiving GoFundMe requests, they stopped being embarrassed about creating their own \u2013 in much the same way, he says, that you might have been nervous the first time you ordered an Uber, and now it\u2019s part of your everyday life. \u201cThe internet has given tools that were only available to big companies or governments and put them in the hands of people,\u201d he says. The normalisation of crowdfunding can be related to wider global trends, from the 2008 economic recession to austerity politics and David Cameron\u2019s notion of the \u201cbig society\u201d, one in which volunteers filled the role of the state. There are 728 GoFundMe results for the search term \u201cUniversal credit\u201d and 11,846 for \u201cfood bank\u201d. \u201cUniversal credit paid my mum \u00a36 for the month,\u201d reads one page. \u201cMy mother is 55. She\u2019s worked all her life. She was attacked in her care job months ago and now has a serious back injury and her doctor will not let her go back to work. She\u2019s had to apply for UC. She got her first payment today: \u00a36.\u201d The page raised more than \u00a37,000. In the face of budget cuts, British schools are now using Amazon Wishlists to crowdfund their classroom needs, asking people to donate stationery, books and sports equipment. Jenny Rogers, headteacher at Copmanthorpe primary school in York, set up an Amazon Wishlist to bulk up the school\u2019s library; on the day before we speak, the school was gifted an entire set of Harry Potter novels by a parent. \u201cI\u2019ve been a headteacher for nine years and budgets have become even tighter,\u201d Rogers says. \u201cBooks and things that we should be able to afford are now almost a luxury.\u201d You could argue that ordering books via Amazon is only marginally different from handing over 50p in the hope of winning the raffle\u2019s finest bottle of bubble bath at the school fete. But one significant change has been at university level, where online crowdfunding moved from a \u201cneeds\u201d- to a \u201cwants\u201d-based model in the late 2000s. In 2012, GoFundMe co-founder Brad Damphousse told Bloomberg Businessweek that university students were increasingly using his site to pay their tuition costs, including for opportunities to study abroad. Because a master\u2019s degree is not usually seen to be as much of a necessity as pencils for 10-year-olds, good storytelling tended to predicate a crowdfunder\u2019s success. As a creative writing student, Lulu Jemimah knows how to structure a narrative. In 2017, the 32-year-old Ugandan was accepted on to Oxford University\u2019s creative writing master\u2019s programme; unable to find the fees herself, she successfully crowdfunded the first year of her tuition. In 2018, after attempting and failing to earn the money for her second year, Jemimah decided to marry herself. \u201cI felt really embarrassed to do a second crowdfunding,\u201d Jemimah says now. \u201cSo I thought I could use my wedding as a story.\u201d Frustrated that relatives and family friends were unimpressed with her studies and instead repeatedly asked her when she would marry and have children, Jemimah hired a wedding gown, asked her brother to bake a cake, and married herself on her 32nd birthday in August 2018. Two months later, she used footage from the day to crowdfund the second year of her master\u2019s. \u201cThis is my love story,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI got married to the one person I am certain will take care of me.\u201d She described seeing snow for the first time, and sleeping in the college library. \u201cI thought people were going to ridicule me, but then it got picked up,\u201d she says. In total, Jemimah\u2019s two crowdfunding efforts raised \u00a323,937 from 448 people. \u201cPeople were apologetic, which I found really strange, like \u2018Sorry, I only have \u00a320\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cI was just overwhelmed by the support.\u201d But there were angry messages, too, from people who felt Jemimah should have earned the money herself. \u201cYou almost have to struggle to remember the positive comments,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause I would read a negative comment and my whole day would be ruined.\u201d In February this year, an Edinburgh couple were told to \u201cget a job\u201d and \u201cstop scrounging\u201d by angry commenters after they started a GoFundMe to raise \u00a34,500 for their wedding. In June, a German influencer couple who asked for \u20ac10,000 to fund their tandem cycle to Africa found their social media accounts flooded with posts calling them \u201cnarcissists\u201d, \u201cdouchebags\u201d and \u201centitled\u201d. (They had half-anticipated this, writing in their original Facebook post: \u201cSome will tell us to get jobs like everyone else, and stop begging. But when you have the impact we do on others\u2019 life, getting a job is not an option.\u201d) For many people who have benefited from crowdfunding, free money isn\u2019t always as free as it seems. \u201cThere is a lot of guilt,\u201d says Jemimah. \u201cSometimes when I want to watch a movie I think, \u2018No, you have to be focusing on your work.\u2019\u201d Mollie Goodfellow, a 26-year-old comedy writer and popular Twitter personality, admits that she felt embarrassed after receiving gifts when she shared an Amazon Wishlist with her 32,000 followers. (The page had been set up for family and friends, but after Goodfellow tweeted it once, she started receiving books from strangers.) \u201cIt made me feel really conflicted,\u201d she tells me. \u201cObviously I was grateful and touched, but I felt guilty that they would spend their money on me when all I really do is write dumb tweets.\u201d Gerber points out that giving isn\u2019t always as altruistic as it seems. \u201cThe hope is that if you back somebody else who has a big network, they will share your project with their network. So you\u2019re paying for access,\u201d she says. This becomes problematic when we foster online \u201cparasocial relationships\u201d \u2013 relationships in which one person feels close to a high-profile individual who isn\u2019t aware they exist. The personal stories shared on crowdfunding sites can make donors feel they know a stranger when, in reality, they aren\u2019t who they seem to be. In July this year, Henry (not his real name), a 29-year-old copy editor from Boston, donated $50 via the digital wallet app Venmo to a low-profile comedian who posted on Twitter that he was depressed and suicidal. \u201cI decided to donate because he seemed like he was going through a really hard time,\u201d Henry says. Days later, the comedian was accused of sexual harassment and abuse by two women, leading to further rumours that he used the crowdfunded money to buy drugs. \u201cI felt gullible, but mostly I was upset on behalf of his victims and hoping that the money I gave him didn\u2019t perpetuate his addictions and lead to him hurting anybody,\u201d Henry says now. Crowdfunding is now so ubiquitous that the solution was simple \u2013 Henry went on to donate to the women who had accused the comedian of abuse, after they tweeted links to fundraising pages. Ultimately, of course, it is up to donors how they choose to spend their money \u2013 and often they have no expectations of a return on their investment. Philadelphia-based project manager Matt Black crowdfunded his Halloween and Day of the Dead-themed 50th birthday party last year, and says he had no complaints. He had not seen anyone else use GoFundMe to throw a party, but had used the site to donate to a friend who was struggling to make his mortgage payments. Inspired by that example, he made his request as candid as possible. \u201cOkay, I know that GoFundMe campaigns are usually for charity or worthy causes, and it could seem egotistical and selfish to crowdfund my own birthday party, but... ,\u201d Black wrote, before explaining that he wanted a \u201ccelebration of life\u201d in lieu of presents. \u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018Woe is me, feel sorry for me, I can\u2019t afford this or that,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cThis is a party for me and my friends, and I chose it to be a relatively expensive event.\u201d He raised $940 of his $1,500 goal from friends, hired his favourite band, rented a room in his local bar, and encouraged his guests to wear costumes. Not everyone who donated turned up; Black says people used their gift as a way to apologise for not being able to make the event. Every day, across all the various fundraising platforms, the requests keep coming: often hitting that sweet spot between incredibly mundane and genuinely unusual. \u201cI want to dye my hair blond, please help a gal out,\u201d reads one, from a woman in Ireland, posted on 11 August. \u201cI\u2019m 20 years old and I want my first car to be a Mercedes-Benz,\u201d says another, posted in June. A woman in London wants a new hamster cage for her \u201clovely ball of fur\u201d, Mozzarella. A man in the West Midlands wants \u00a3500 for his stag do. A college student in Wraysbury, Surrey, needs to pay off his parking ticket. Many of these people might not earn a penny from strangers on the internet, but what they\u2019re doing is no longer seen as strange. A man from Ohio has set up a GoFundMe page for a preemptive emergency fund \u2013 a just-in-case pot. \u201cI\u2019m setting this up to help with any legal/medical/repair debts that are inevitably going to happen,\u201d he wrote, setting his target at $10,000. \u201cWhy not? I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve donated to dumber causes.\u201d \u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

      "bodyText": "With its seamless indoor and outdoor living spaces, and its Australian owner, this contemporary family home is more Brisbane than Britain. Tucked behind a suburban street, the plot, which formerly housed garages, is bordered by a stream with parkland beyond and surrounded by greenery. \u201cWhen I get back from work I\u2019m greeted by views of woodland, and the sounds of water and birdsong; it\u2019s instantly calming,\u201d says Pia Fairhurst. She shares the home with her husband Jonny and their daughters Paris, nine, and Amelie, six. \u201cWe loved the idea of having no direct neighbours, and access to the garden from all sides.\u201d The house takes full advantage of its bucolic setting: glazed doors connect each of the key living spaces with an outdoor terrace. Outside a reading room\u2019s picture window, hardy ornamental grass (Stipa tenuissima) sways gently in the breeze and masks a rare glimpse of a nearby house. Indoor plants such as Ficus elastica \u2018Abidjan\u2019 (rubber plant) and Euphorbia triangularis (chandelier tree) bring bursts of green inside, too. The architects, 31/44, laid out the ground floor as four rooms: an eat-in kitchen with plywood units and walls; a utility room; a double-height reading room with a wood-burning stove, a skylight, and a vibrant mural painted by artist Emma Jones (emmajones.ink); as well as a more formal living space with a built-in fireplace. All the rooms are positioned around a cross-shaped hallway. On the first floor are a master bedroom, a further three bedrooms and a bathroom. A large roof light above the entrance hall brings daylight into the core of the building. It was while visiting the home of one of the cofounders of the architectural practice, as part of London\u2019s Open House festival in 2016, that the couple learned the firm had just completed this house for a developer. \u201cWe hotfooted it over that afternoon,\u201d Jonny says. \u201cWe could only peer through the gates, but that was all it took.\u201d The flooring is a combination of large-format grey tiles and pale oak boards; oak veneer is used for the kitchen cabinets as well as the living room walls, the latter nodding to panelling found in more formal homes. Emma Jones also created the mural in the hallway, featuring monochrome botanical drawings. Planters suspended from the galleried staircase introduce more pops of chlorophyll. The furniture includes a smattering of modern-day icons \u2013 Hella Jongerius\u2019s joyous Polder sofa and the Slow chair by Ronan and Erwan Bouroullec \u2013 mixed with mid-20th-century pieces such as a G Plan coffee table. Inspired by the late landscape designer John Brookes \u2013 who created gardens as outdoor rooms, making areas for sitting and enjoying different views of the house and garden \u2013 the outdoor spaces include a sitting area, a dining area and two play areas for the children featuring a sunken trampoline, bars and a tree swing. There is also a kitchen complete with a vegetable garden, herb garden, barbecue, tandoor and pizza oven. Contemporary pieces by Danish brand Hay (hay.dk) furnish the outdoor seating areas, selected because they are lightweight and their minimal lines don\u2019t obstruct the views from the house; the dining area features a table and benches from a German beer hall (found at a local market). \u201cThe furniture is intended to live outside all year round,\u201d Pia says. \u201cWe soften it in warmer months with cushions, throws and rugs.\u201d The garden is an ongoing project: \u201cThis year we have sown wild grasses and meadow flowers at the back of the house for a more organic effect, so that it looks like an extension of the park,\u201d Pia says. Jonny, meanwhile, is planning to build a structure to cover the outdoor kitchen. \u201cThat way we can easily cook outside in the rain \u2013 or even the snow.\u201d",

The shortage is causing difficulties for thousands of women in the UK, medical experts have said.

But it all happened when she was in her mid-20s \u2013 too young and green, she says now, to feel daunted. Since then, she\u2019s been teaching fiction at Hunter College in New York, publishing short stories, and <em>not</em> publishing drafts of two full novels. \u201cAll kinds of things interested me, but none of them drew me in enough,\u201d she says. \u201cI was writing more as a way to flex those muscles, but I could feel that my focus on the page and the way I was approaching writing was starting to change. And it frightened me.\u201d</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until the camels showed up that she found a way to push forward. \u201cAnimals have this unnerving tendency to creep into my work, even when I\u2019m trying to hold them at bay,\u201d she says. Animals come up in conversation too, when she describes her efforts to find a new project as placing \u201clittle book turtles down on the racetrack\u201d. If not a writer, she would have become a zoologist or biologist. \u201cOn a psychological level, I\u2019m deeply interested in three things,\u201d she says, checking them off on her fingers. \u201cWho people are when they\u2019re alone and no one\u2019s watching; who people are when they\u2019re telling themselves the most palatable stories of their lives; and then who people are with animals.\u201d</p> <p>All three of those interests are richly present in <em>Inland</em>, which draws on Obreht\u2019s longstanding curiosity about the American west. She has spent time travelling through Arizona and Texas, and owns a holiday home in Wyoming, a vast distance physically and culturally from her Manhattan home and the Upper West Side cafe where we\u2019re discussing the book. Like many visitors, she was \u201cfloored\u201d by the desert landscape, but felt a pull stronger than simple tourist curiosity.

When she was 12, her grandparents returned to Belgrade and she and her mother emigrated to the US. Her close relationship with her grandfather underpins <em>The Tiger\u2019s Wife</em>, and when he died in 2006, she adopted and began writing under his last name.</p> <p>It was through her grandparents\u2019 love of classic Hollywood westerns that Obreht first imbibed the cowboy vision of the American west. As she researched the history, however, she discovered it was \u201ca lot more diverse than anything that is handed down by history or by lore\u201d. As an immigrant, she was particularly keen to uncover the mixing of cultures that went into shaping that quintessentially American landscape, and to put her own spin on the genre\u2019s tropes. The relationship between Lurie and Burke, the camel he adopts, draws on the essential bond between a man and his horse. \u201cIt\u2019s for transportation, it\u2019s for shelter, it\u2019s your currency if you need it,\u201d she explains. But the camel also gives Lurie a sense of purpose and identity, enabling him to embrace his Ottoman roots. \u201cHis home is the camel.\u201d</p> <p>Obreht\u2019s sprawling cast of characters are all carefully named, allowing her to tell stories in miniature about identity and origins. Spanish names, historical and fictional, are a reminder that many Mexicans in the southwest were not immigrants, but were made foreign as the border migrated around them. (Modern-day Arizona was part of Mexico for the first half of the 19th century, and did not become a US state until 1912.) Lurie, whose name comes from a garbling of Djuri\u0107, later befriends a man based on a mysterious real figure named Hadji Ali, a convert to Islam of Greek and Syrian origin, who travelled with the camel corps and became known as <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hi-jolly-monument\" title=\"\">Hi Jolly</a>. His story allowed Obreht to explore the ironies of the era\u2019s shifting global power dynamics, in which a man who had \u201clived under the heel of the Ottoman empire\u201d finds himself, quite by accident, serving \u201cas part of the fist that holds the hammer of a new empire\u201d.</p> <p>Although their presence is constant in the book, Native Americans stand somewhat outside its central perspective. Obreht is thoughtful as she considers why she made this choice. \u201cI\u2019m glad to be writing at a time when more and more voices are able to tell their own stories, and I did not feel that it was my place to encroach on that,\u201d she explains. \u201cMy interest was to examine the immigrant perspective, but to try to be as honest as possible about what that meant, with respect to incursion and the overrunning of Native American lands.\u201d It\u2019s also a practical question of surviving sources, of what stories were written down and preserved, and by whom.</p> <p>To research the history of the camels\u2019 presence in the west, Obreht relied heavily on the diary of <a href=\"https://www.legendsofamerica.com/we-edwardbeale/\" title=\"\">Edward Fitzgerald Beale</a>, who headed up the camel expedition. Because his was a military record and gave the coordinates of every camp, she was able to revisit all the spots that are accessible by car, which today include \u201can ultramodernist church\u201d and the Albuquerque Greyhound station. Beale\u2019s assistant, with no interest in proving the value of these curious beasts, barely takes notice of the camels. \u201cHe mentions them once, like: \u2018All today, the camels were a pain in the ass as usual.\u2019 That\u2019s it.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The beauty of the desert is rooted in its inhospitableness. 'Maybe the binary in the novel is: is this beautiful, or is this a pain in the ass?'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Obreht also immersed herself in the newspapers of the time, as a resource for shaping the novel\u2019s language. She stayed away from contemporary fiction about the west by writers such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2009/dec/20/observer-profile-cormac-mccarthy\" title=\"\">Cormac McCarthy</a> in case she was influenced by them, especially by descriptions of the landscape. The beauty of the desert, after all, is rooted in its inhospitableness and for Nora, tormented by thirst as she moves across it, stunning vistas are hardly at the forefront of her mind. \u201cMaybe the binary in the novel is: is this beautiful, or is this a pain in the ass?\u201d Obreht says with a laugh.</p> <p>It\u2019s a disruptive choice to make a woman a central character in a western story, neither a silent wife nor one of the \u201cbalcony women\u201d whose business relies on the constant flow of lonely strangers through town. \u201cOne of the tropes of the western that really grabbed me was the woman in the corner, just scowling and literally stirring the pot,\u201d Obreht says. In contrast to the men for whom home is wherever there\u2019s a stream of water or a campfire, Nora is fiercely focused on protecting her domestic realm, \u201cthis one little patch of life that she is capable of defending\u201d.</p> <p>In the diaries and letters of homesteading women, Obreht was struck by the \u201cripples of terror or rage\u201d rising up out of these otherwise fatalistic, even contented accounts of lives haunted by uncertainty and death. Nora\u2019s rage is partly directed at Josie, a young relative of her husband\u2019s from the east, who brings with her a brand of feminine helplessness that seduces Nora\u2019s sons and that Nora herself has worked hard to slough off. Yet there is something universal in her rage, too. Obreht describes how her grandmother, at the end of her life, likewise began to express \u201cthings that she, I guess, had been enraged about her whole life but hadn\u2019t given voice to\u201d. Despite feeling that she had lived a good life, \u201chere they were, finally coming to the surface\u201d.</p> <p>Nora\u2019s story plays out in 1893, a period of profound transition in the west \u2013 in many ways, the end of the old west as a remote and mythologised place. \u201cIt was after the laying of the Transcontinental Railroad and the massacre at Wounded Knee, which represented, in this nationalistic sense, the end of the Native American resistance,\u201d Obreht says. The railroad is fundamental to the geography of the novel: its title, <em>Inland</em>, she explains, is how people referred to land away from the train tracks \u2013 it has nothing to do with the coastline, but marks the distance between places that develop and those that wither in isolation.</p> <p>The newspaper, too, is an essential source of connection and power. \u201cBack then, your newspaper was everything.\u201d The paper run by Nora\u2019s husband supplies information and gossip, but also has the power to shape politics and history, to privilege certain stories over others. Cattle barons, she explains, bought up newspapers in the effort to assert a moral right to the power they\u2019d grabbed. They spread the myth that their rise was linked to their inherent virtue and strength. \u201cIt\u2019s bootstrap narrative at its absolute core, its beginnings.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3bd1160808fec99a137e427f98e9308d39d0106b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3bd1160808fec99a137e427f98e9308d39d0106b/0_668_3285_3789/867.jpg\" alt=\"Hi Jolly\u2019s tomb in Quartzsite cemetery, Arizona.\" width=\"867\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hi Jolly\u2019s tomb in Quartzsite cemetery, Arizona.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maurice Savage/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The telephone has the power to collapse even bigger distances. In one striking scene, Nora and her fellow townsfolk gather to witness the first exchange of words by phone, an almost magical event that makes her wonder if the gulf between the living and the dead might eventually be bridged by some as-yet-uninvented technology. Nora talks to her daughter, who died as a baby, while Lurie finds himself taken over by the \u201cwanting\u201d of people he\u2019s lost. Yet there\u2019s nothing fantastical about the way these relationships are portrayed. They are simply part of the reality of living in a place where people can disappear for weeks on end, where you don\u2019t know whether they\u2019re living or dead. And it\u2019s a consequence, for Obreht, of the fundamental violence of the west. \u201cIt feels haunted to be there, and so much of that is owed to this horrific history on which the shaping of this country really sits.\u201d</p> <p>A novelist can\u2019t predict the world into which her novel is launched, but it\u2019s impossible to discuss questions of borders and history without bringing up the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/11/ice-raids-sunday-latest-undocumented-immigration-operation-trump-administration\" title=\"\"> current climate of anti-immigrant rhetoric </a>and violence. Obreht can\u2019t help but be struck by the similarities between the world of her book and today. \u201cI thought I was writing a book set in the west in the 1890s and I didn\u2019t realise how much of it was going to align with this particular cycle that we\u2019ve fallen into now,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat it showed me was that cultural discourse in this country, as in many others, operates in cyclical ways. We go forward a little bit and then we fall back. We make some progress but also revert in these horrific ways to things we\u2019ve been fighting against for hundreds of years.\u201d</p> <p>Obreht sees it as part of a repeating cycle of anxiety about who belongs, who is truly American \u2013 and as evidence of the power of story. When Nora, unable to communicate with her Apache neighbours, convinces herself that they wish her harm, the result is disaster.</p> <p>\u201cIf what you\u2019re being told by every possible source your entire life is: \u2018These people are here to hurt you,\u2019 I don\u2019t think it matters what century you\u2019re in. If you\u2019re 80% of people, you\u2019re gonna flinch.\u201d That\u2019s true regardless of who is threatening you, and is part of what excites her about historical fiction: its ability to illuminate what returns and what endures. \u201cHuman cruelty, human frailty, vanity, paranoia - their modalities change and maybe their tone changes a little bit from century to century, but, actually, they stay the same,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re reptilian.\u201d </p> <p><em>\u2022 Inland</em> by T\u00e9a Obreht is published by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson (\u00a314.99).

Nora\u2019s story plays out in 1893, a period of profound transition in the west \u2013 in many ways, the end of the old west as a remote and mythologised place. \u201cIt was after the laying of the Transcontinental Railroad and the massacre at Wounded Knee, which represented, in this nationalistic sense, the end of the Native American resistance,\u201d Obreht says. The railroad is fundamental to the geography of the novel: its title, Inland, she explains, is how people referred to land away from the train tracks \u2013 it has nothing to do with the coastline, but marks the distance between places that develop and those that wither in isolation. The newspaper, too, is an essential source of connection and power. \u201cBack then, your newspaper was everything.\u201d The paper run by Nora\u2019s husband supplies information and gossip, but also has the power to shape politics and history, to privilege certain stories over others. Cattle barons, she explains, bought up newspapers in the effort to assert a moral right to the power they\u2019d grabbed. They spread the myth that their rise was linked to their inherent virtue and strength. \u201cIt\u2019s bootstrap narrative at its absolute core, its beginnings.\u201d The telephone has the power to collapse even bigger distances. In one striking scene, Nora and her fellow townsfolk gather to witness the first exchange of words by phone, an almost magical event that makes her wonder if the gulf between the living and the dead might eventually be bridged by some as-yet-uninvented technology. Nora talks to her daughter, who died as a baby, while Lurie finds himself taken over by the \u201cwanting\u201d of people he\u2019s lost. Yet there\u2019s nothing fantastical about the way these relationships are portrayed. They are simply part of the reality of living in a place where people can disappear for weeks on end, where you don\u2019t know whether they\u2019re living or dead. And it\u2019s a consequence, for Obreht, of the fundamental violence of the west. \u201cIt feels haunted to be there, and so much of that is owed to this horrific history on which the shaping of this country really sits.\u201d A novelist can\u2019t predict the world into which her novel is launched, but it\u2019s impossible to discuss questions of borders and history without bringing up the current climate of anti-immigrant rhetoric and violence. Obreht can\u2019t help but be struck by the similarities between the world of her book and today. \u201cI thought I was writing a book set in the west in the 1890s and I didn\u2019t realise how much of it was going to align with this particular cycle that we\u2019ve fallen into now,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat it showed me was that cultural discourse in this country, as in many others, operates in cyclical ways. We go forward a little bit and then we fall back. We make some progress but also revert in these horrific ways to things we\u2019ve been fighting against for hundreds of years.\u201d Obreht sees it as part of a repeating cycle of anxiety about who belongs, who is truly American \u2013 and as evidence of the power of story. When Nora, unable to communicate with her Apache neighbours, convinces herself that they wish her harm, the result is disaster. \u201cIf what you\u2019re being told by every possible source your entire life is: \u2018These people are here to hurt you,\u2019 I don\u2019t think it matters what century you\u2019re in. If you\u2019re 80% of people, you\u2019re gonna flinch.\u201d That\u2019s true regardless of who is threatening you, and is part of what excites her about historical fiction: its ability to illuminate what returns and what endures. \u201cHuman cruelty, human frailty, vanity, paranoia - their modalities change and maybe their tone changes a little bit from century to century, but, actually, they stay the same,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re reptilian.\u201d \u2022 Inland by T\u00e9a Obreht is published by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson (\u00a314.99).

      "body": "<p>The yellow postal bus lurches up the narrow, dead-end road that winds through Valle Onsernone, blasting its horn in warning as it rounds one cliff-hugging hairpin turn after another. Just a flimsy-looking guardrail separates us from the yawning ravine below. Heart somewhere in my throat, I wonder how many previous buses have tumbled over it into the churning Isorno River. For the record, the answer is none \u2013 this is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/switzerland\" title=\"\">Switzerland</a>, after all.</p> <p>Just 25 minutes ago I was in the manicured lakeside resort of Locarno, watching wealthy holidaymakers clink Aperol spritzes. Now, as I shakily disembark in front of the Villa Edera hostel, I\u2019m surrounded by birdsong, the hum of insects and towering peaks in innumerable shades of green. On the sunny northern side of the river, a chain of tiny hamlets stretch to the Italian border, their architecture a mix of traditional slate-roofed houses and ornate villas built by boastful \u00e9migr\u00e9s. To the south stand a handful of solitary stone huts, accessible only on foot.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/08/swiss-map-zip/giv-3902xL0aqUYBTuBW\" data-alt=\"Italy and Switzerland map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/08/swiss-map-zip/giv-3902xL0aqUYBTuBW\">Italy and Switzerland map</a> </figure>  <p>This rugged stillness brought artists and writers such as Max Ernst and Kurt Tucholksy to this corner of Ticino, in southern Switzerland, in the 1930s.

Born in Onsernone but brought up mostly in his mother\u2019s native US, he returned on holiday in 2016 after becoming disillusioned by a career in foreign aid. Mike was dismayed to find half-empty villages, closed schoolhouses and an ageing population that had dwindled to 700 from a 19th-century high of 4,000. So he decided to apply the experience he\u2019d acquired in Chad, the Middle East and Afghanistan to his hometown. Starting, but definitely not ending, with a hostel.</p> <p>Under his direction, Villa Edera transformed from prison-like municipal student accommodation to a cheery backpacker hub, with a fridge full of local craft beer and a bright-yellow common area lined with upcycled antiques. Flyers in the hall direct guests to the valley\u2019s most popular hiking trails (on which you\u2019re still likely to be alone, even at the height of summer) and the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Museo-Onsernonese/1433044886959885\" title=\"\">museum in nearby Loco</a>, where Italian and German speakers can load up on Onsernone history.</p> <p>In addition to running this and two group hostels \u2013 in Loco and Vergeletto, further up a side valley \u2013 Mike mans the information point next door, where he tells newcomers all about the delights of his birthplace with the persuasive zeal of a tech chief executive who\u2019s discovered microdosing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"66bc5d655ffc28204bb7006f4abe32b04f9770f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66bc5d655ffc28204bb7006f4abe32b04f9770f7/0_0_1300_864/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The mountain village of Isorno in the Vergeletto valley.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The mountain village of Isorno in the Vergeletto valley.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On his lead, I end up in a genteel hamlet a few miles to the west called Berzona, famous as the final residence of Swiss playwright Max Frisch. Here, at <a href=\"https://www.pagliarte.ch/?lang=en\" title=\"\">Pagliarte</a>, Spanish-German transplant Lara Blumer heads a collective of women reviving the valley\u2019s flagship trade: straw hats. Before the industrial revolution, nearly every man, woman and child in Onsernone was involved in the business, whether harvesting rye from terraces carved into the steep mountainsides, softening and braiding the straw, or carrying the products on muleback to the market town of Intragna.</p> <p>Today, the old mule path is a gentle hiking trail, and Blumer and her colleagues make their hats, bags and keychains out of pre-plaited rice straw bought from a Florence wholesaler. \u201cI want a product locals can afford, and that wouldn\u2019t be the case if we were braiding it ourselves. We tried: it takes forever!\u201d</p> <p>But she has begun growing rye for another Pagliarte product: an all-natural alternative to plastic drinking straws.</p> <p>In Vergeletto, I meet Pagliarte\u2019s founder, Ilario Garbani. Since 2009, the retired teacher and avid local historian has been preoccupied with Onsernone\u2019s other signature product: <em>farina b\u00f2na</em>, or<em> </em>roasted cornflour. In his village\u2019s former school gym, he heats the kernels until they\u2019re \u201cone-third popcorn\u201d; next, he hauls them to the restored watermill above, where they\u2019re stone-ground into a fine powder. The subtly sweet result is a hit with Swiss foodies \u2013 Garbani estimates he ships 10 tonnes a year to restaurants and supermarkets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"037a582d72f17cc09ea077862c4fcbe023c84d38\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/037a582d72f17cc09ea077862c4fcbe023c84d38/0_0_1300_865/1000.jpg\" alt=\"wild flowers in Switzerland, Europe, canton, Ticino, Valle di\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Vergeletto valley in bloom.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dukas Presseagentur/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Until recently, the mill and Pagliarte received state support as part of a decade-in-the-making plan to turn Valle Onsernone and its environs into a national park \u2013 which would have been only the second in Switzerland. The project would have injected millions into the local economy and infrastructure, but many here saw it as an unnecessary imposition \u2013 among them the dropouts who moved here precisely to escape such authority, and old-timers afraid of losing the freedom to hunt and protect their livestock from wolves. (Park plans didn\u2019t restrict that freedom, but a virulent internet campaign suggested otherwise.)</p> <p>In June 2018, residents voted down the park by a slim margin, leaving Blumer and Garbani on their own and the valley bitterly divided.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a wound that still hasn\u2019t healed,\u201d says Markus Weibel, an anaesthetist from Bern who runs a hilltop B&amp;B called <a href=\"https://palazzobarione.ch/\" title=\"\">Palazzo Barione</a>. He recalls the plebiscite as a \u201cdark day\u201d.

Chiefly, he doesn\u2019t want more visitors tramping past his home on the way to Bagni di Craveggia, an abandoned thermal spa just over the Italian border that is the closest thing Onsernone has to a proper tourist attraction.</p> <p>And there, he\u2019s got a point.

      "bodyText": "The yellow postal bus lurches up the narrow, dead-end road that winds through Valle Onsernone, blasting its horn in warning as it rounds one cliff-hugging hairpin turn after another. Just a flimsy-looking guardrail separates us from the yawning ravine below. Heart somewhere in my throat, I wonder how many previous buses have tumbled over it into the churning Isorno River. For the record, the answer is none \u2013 this is Switzerland, after all. Just 25 minutes ago I was in the manicured lakeside resort of Locarno, watching wealthy holidaymakers clink Aperol spritzes. Now, as I shakily disembark in front of the Villa Edera hostel, I\u2019m surrounded by birdsong, the hum of insects and towering peaks in innumerable shades of green. On the sunny northern side of the river, a chain of tiny hamlets stretch to the Italian border, their architecture a mix of traditional slate-roofed houses and ornate villas built by boastful \u00e9migr\u00e9s. To the south stand a handful of solitary stone huts, accessible only on foot. This rugged stillness brought artists and writers such as Max Ernst and Kurt Tucholksy to this corner of Ticino, in southern Switzerland, in the 1930s. It later drew a wave of Swiss-German Aussteiger \u2013 nature-loving hippy \u201cdropouts\u201d, who risked the antagonism of Italian-speaking locals for a chance to live truly off the grid. And it\u2019s what Villa Edera manager Mike Keller, the 37-year-old son of two such escapees, hopes will bring a new generation to Switzerland\u2019s wildest valley. \u201cI never used to tell anyone but close friends where I came from \u2013 I was always worried it would become overrun by tourists,\u201d Mike says. Born in Onsernone but brought up mostly in his mother\u2019s native US, he returned on holiday in 2016 after becoming disillusioned by a career in foreign aid. Mike was dismayed to find half-empty villages, closed schoolhouses and an ageing population that had dwindled to 700 from a 19th-century high of 4,000. So he decided to apply the experience he\u2019d acquired in Chad, the Middle East and Afghanistan to his hometown. Starting, but definitely not ending, with a hostel. Under his direction, Villa Edera transformed from prison-like municipal student accommodation to a cheery backpacker hub, with a fridge full of local craft beer and a bright-yellow common area lined with upcycled antiques. Flyers in the hall direct guests to the valley\u2019s most popular hiking trails (on which you\u2019re still likely to be alone, even at the height of summer) and the museum in nearby Loco, where Italian and German speakers can load up on Onsernone history. In addition to running this and two group hostels \u2013 in Loco and Vergeletto, further up a side valley \u2013 Mike mans the information point next door, where he tells newcomers all about the delights of his birthplace with the persuasive zeal of a tech chief executive who\u2019s discovered microdosing. On his lead, I end up in a genteel hamlet a few miles to the west called Berzona, famous as the final residence of Swiss playwright Max Frisch. Here, at Pagliarte, Spanish-German transplant Lara Blumer heads a collective of women reviving the valley\u2019s flagship trade: straw hats. Before the industrial revolution, nearly every man, woman and child in Onsernone was involved in the business, whether harvesting rye from terraces carved into the steep mountainsides, softening and braiding the straw, or carrying the products on muleback to the market town of Intragna. Today, the old mule path is a gentle hiking trail, and Blumer and her colleagues make their hats, bags and keychains out of pre-plaited rice straw bought from a Florence wholesaler. \u201cI want a product locals can afford, and that wouldn\u2019t be the case if we were braiding it ourselves. We tried: it takes forever!\u201d But she has begun growing rye for another Pagliarte product: an all-natural alternative to plastic drinking straws. In Vergeletto, I meet Pagliarte\u2019s founder, Ilario Garbani. Since 2009, the retired teacher and avid local historian has been preoccupied with Onsernone\u2019s other signature product: farina b\u00f2na, or roasted cornflour. In his village\u2019s former school gym, he heats the kernels until they\u2019re \u201cone-third popcorn\u201d; next, he hauls them to the restored watermill above, where they\u2019re stone-ground into a fine powder. The subtly sweet result is a hit with Swiss foodies \u2013 Garbani estimates he ships 10 tonnes a year to restaurants and supermarkets. Until recently, the mill and Pagliarte received state support as part of a decade-in-the-making plan to turn Valle Onsernone and its environs into a national park \u2013 which would have been only the second in Switzerland. The project would have injected millions into the local economy and infrastructure, but many here saw it as an unnecessary imposition \u2013 among them the dropouts who moved here precisely to escape such authority, and old-timers afraid of losing the freedom to hunt and protect their livestock from wolves. (Park plans didn\u2019t restrict that freedom, but a virulent internet campaign suggested otherwise.) In June 2018, residents voted down the park by a slim margin, leaving Blumer and Garbani on their own and the valley bitterly divided. \u201cIt\u2019s a wound that still hasn\u2019t healed,\u201d says Markus Weibel, an anaesthetist from Bern who runs a hilltop B&amp;B called Palazzo Barione. He recalls the plebiscite as a \u201cdark day\u201d. His neighbours, who own a flock of free-grazing sheep, celebrated with fireworks. Most of the people I meet in Valle Onsernone are in favour of a national park \u2013 though on a trip to Spruga, the hippy stronghold at the valley\u2019s endpoint, I come across an ear-ringed beekeeper named Basil who is against the project. Chiefly, he doesn\u2019t want more visitors tramping past his home on the way to Bagni di Craveggia, an abandoned thermal spa just over the Italian border that is the closest thing Onsernone has to a proper tourist attraction. And there, he\u2019s got a point. In 2009, a 300-strong \u201crainbow gathering\u201d at Craveggia proved a bit much for the valley to handle. A tourist influx of the sort that plagues Valle Verzasca, north-east of Locarno \u2013 whose arched Roman bridge is a fast-rising Instagram fixture \u2013 could destroy the blissful isolation that makes Onsernone special, and upset its patchwork community\u2019s delicate balance. Which is why, though disheartened by the park vote, Mike at the hostel sees a silver lining. \u201cWith the park, we wouldn\u2019t have had an influence over what kind of people come here ... This way, we\u2019ve got a chance to develop a marketing plan specifically for this valley,\u201d he says. Which people would those be? Villa Edera has already brought a jolt of young, international energy to Onsernone\u2019s usual summer crowd of in-the-know Swiss Germans. Modern-day \u201cwellness\u201d types are a logical target demographic and Keller caters for them with Saturday yoga sessions and the occasional stone mandala workshop.

In 2015, it was taken over by a thirtysomething Italian couple who met at a Zen monastery and now host yoga and tai chi retreats there. But Keller\u2019s vision for Onsernone goes beyond yoga, or Blumer and Garbani\u2019s folk traditions: \u201cProtecting what we have here is a noble idea ... but what about something else?\u201d Every week or so, he rings the mayor to present his latest scheme for rejuvenating the valley, and is usually summarily dismissed.

      "body": "<p>Eniola Aluko is one of only 11 female footballers to have played more than 100 times for England. She has scored some of the Lionesses\u2019 most memorable goals, was the first female pundit on Match Of The Day, and is a qualified lawyer, having graduated from Brunel University London with a first in 2008. But it is as a whistleblower that she is destined to be best remembered. And, like many whistleblowers, she has spent the subsequent years being rubbished by those she exposed.</p> <p>Now she has written a memoir. They Don\u2019t Teach This is a fascinating examination of her multiple identities \u2013 British and Nigerian, a girl in a boy\u2019s world, footballer and academic, a kid from an estate with upper-middle-class parents, a God-fearing rebel. But the book is at its best when she reveals exactly what happened after she accused the England management team of racism, and the Football Association of turning a blind eye to it. Aluko does not hold back \u2013 and few people from the football establishment emerge with their reputation intact.</p> <p>Aluko now plays for Juventus in Italy, but we meet at her old stomping ground, Brunel. She has been delayed by traffic, which gives me time to explore the sports centre. On the wall are three huge, framed posters of Brunel alumni \u2013 sporting legends. Guess who they are, I say to Aluko when she arrives. \u201cMo Farah, definitely,\u201d she says instantly. And? \u201cErm\u2026 oh, Usain Bolt! Obviously! He trained here.\u201d And the third? She is stumped. Then she looks. <em>\u201cOh. My. God!\u201d</em> It is a poster of her playing for England. \u201cWow! That\u2019s amazing.\u201d She looks genuinely thrilled. </p> <p>Aluko has a small, mobile face with striking features \u2013 big, brown eyes and a huge, ear-to-ear smile. When she is unhappy, she makes no attempt to hide it; her glare is as forbidding as the smile is winning. And there haven\u2019t been many times over the past five years that Aluko has had reason to smile.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff76ac09e10dc2ebd7624b5f8219cc5a003e237f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff76ac09e10dc2ebd7624b5f8219cc5a003e237f/0_30_3878_2327/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eniola Aluko playing for England against Germany at Wembley in November 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eniola Aluko playing for England against Germany at Wembley in November 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It all started in January 2014, barely a month after Mark Sampson took over as manager of the Lionesses. Sampson was 30 years old, an inexperienced coach who had never played professional football. At 28, Aluko was virtually an England veteran, a first-team regular and a popular member of the squad who had used her legal skills to champion teammates \u2013 notably helping to draw up a new central contract for the team. The striker was also a conscientious player, always keen to improve her game.</p> <p>Her desire to better herself led to her taking advantage of a new system that enabled players to watch back games and analyse their own performance, while hearing the audio from the management team. After a match against Finland, a 3-1 win for England in which Aluko had scored a goal and made another, she reviewed the footage. Aluko had been pleased with her performance \u2013 which made it more shocking when she heard the audio. \u201cThe goalkeeping coach Lee Kendall said: \u2018Eni is lazy as fuck,\u2019 and: \u2018She\u2019s not fit enough.\u2019 Then, when I lost the ball, he said: \u2018Oh, fuck off, Eni,\u2019\u201d she tells me. She heard no disparaging remarks about other players, nor any positive comments when she scored and assisted a goal.</p> <p>Aluko was confused. She was in the form of her life, with six goals in six games for England. And, more to the point, she says, she had never been called lazy before. \u201cAt the time, I didn\u2019t think too deeply about what was being said. I was just like: why is this being said about me on a portal that everyone can access? Then I started thinking about where has this come from.\u201d The more she thought about it, the more convinced she became that there was a racial connotation. \u201cLook, lazy is a generic term. Anybody can be called lazy if you\u2019re not tracking back. But if you\u2019re black and you\u2019re called lazy, it\u2019s different. Some words have real context to them, and this dates back to slavery times. In that split second, I\u2019m sure Lee Kendall didn\u2019t think about racial connotations, but that\u2019s what racism can be.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One coach spoke to her in a fake Caribbean accent. 'I was tempted to speak to him in a Scottish accent'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One coach spoke to her in a fake Caribbean accent. \u2018I was tempted to speak to him in a Scottish accent, despite knowing he was Welsh.\u2019 Aluko is fully aware, as are most football fans of a certain age, how charged the word \u201clazy\u201d is in relation to black footballers. In 2004, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/apr/22/football.raceintheuk\" title=\"\">the former Manchester United manager Ron Atkinson was sacked as a pundit on ITV</a> (and as a Guardian columnist) after a microphone picked him up saying the French defender Marcel Desailly \u201cis what is known in some schools as a fucking lazy thick nigger\u201d. Aluko knew Kendall\u2019s comment bore no comparison, but she couldn\u2019t help thinking about it. She started to feel the management team had it in for her, but kept stumm. What Kendall had said was unpleasant, but it would be virtually impossible to prove it was anything more. If they didn\u2019t like her, she would show her worth on the pitch. And she did, finishing joint top scorer among all nations competing for qualification for the European Championships in 2015, with 13 goals.</p> <p>But the comments continued \u2013 now to her face. In November 2014, she told Sampson that her family was flying in from Nigeria for a friendly against Germany. He replied: \u201cWell, make sure they don\u2019t come over with Ebola.\u201d (Sampson denied saying this for a long time after.) Aluko says she laughed nervously but was left reeling. She told her England teammate Lianne Sanderson, but said she wasn\u2019t going to make a big deal of it. She wanted to focus on her football.</p> <p>At one point, Kendall, a close friend of Sampson, started speaking to her in a fake Caribbean accent. It infuriated Aluko \u2013 not least because she isn\u2019t from the Caribbean. \u201cI was often tempted to speak to him in a Scottish accent, despite knowing he was Welsh, just to make the point.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5614ddf36ab35f3dc62a2ce323b9a27a646d95e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5614ddf36ab35f3dc62a2ce323b9a27a646d95e4/500_0_2921_3650/800.jpg\" alt=\"Eniola Aluko\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I\u2019m an optimistic, positive person normally, but I was miserable during that time.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Perou/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then she started to notice other things happening to black members of the squad. In October 2015, Chelsea\u2019s midfielder Drew Spence was called up to the England squad for the first time, for a trip to China. Spence told Aluko that, in a meeting of midfielders, Sampson turned to the newcomer and said: \u201cHaven\u2019t you been arrested before, then? Four times, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Spence was the only non-white player in the room and has never been arrested. After making these remarks, Sampson never picked her again for England; she still has only two caps.</p> <p>A few days later, the midfielder Jill Scott was feted when she won her 100th cap against Australia \u2013 speeches were made, she captained the team, a video message was played from her family. In the same match, Sanderson won her 50th cap \u2013 another considerable milestone, normally celebrated with a special shirt \u2013 but this was ignored. Sanderson told Aluko she was devastated; with Aluko\u2019s encouragement, she told Sampson how upset she was, but asked him not to make an issue of it in front of the team. The following day, he addressed the squad, said he had made a mistake in not acknowledging her 50th cap and presented her with a special shirt. Sanderson was never selected for England again.</p> <p>While Sampson did not drop Aluko, he told her repeatedly that he couldn\u2019t rely on her, that she lacked stamina and heart, that she was selfish and didn\u2019t play for the team. After Aluko scored a hat-trick in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2014/sep/18/england-womens-football-team-world-cup-montenegro-video\" title=\"\">10-0 thrashing of Montenegro</a>, Sampson presented her with the ball, telling the team: \u201cWe all know Eni is a pain in the arse, but she did well to score a hat-trick after I gave her the target of scoring five goals today.\u201d</p> <p>Aluko was still reluctant to draw attention to Sampson\u2019s behaviour. \u201cAs black players, you don\u2019t always want to be bringing these issues up. You want to just play football. You know that the accusations of \u2018playing the race card\u2019 are going to come up. So I would bite my tongue. I\u2019d see the level of ignorance, roll my eyes and get on with it.\u201d</p> <p>And so it continued. Aluko says the only thing that kept her going was her desperation to reach 100 caps \u2013 and become the first British-African woman to do so. When it finally happened, in February 2016, the occasion was soured by Sampson. She says he refused to give her advanced notice she would be playing, so she could invite her family. Then, on the morning of the match, Sampson told her she wasn\u2019t in the starting 11 because he wanted to field his strongest team. In the end, he brought her on in the second half and the captain, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/16/steph-houghton-role-model-manchester-city-england-captain-womens-fa-cup\" title=\"\">Steph Houghton</a>, handed her the captain\u2019s band. But by then she was inconsolable.</p> <p>Three months later, in May 2016, the FA invited Aluko to participate in a confidential \u201cculture review\u201d about her experiences as a black woman in the England team. She agreed to a phone interview in which she said that she felt demoralised, and that under Sampson\u2019s management her negative experiences outweighed the positive ones.</p> <p>Twelve days later, she was visited by Sampson at Chelsea\u2019s ground and told she was being dropped from the England squad for \u201cun-Lionness behaviour\u201d and a bad attitude in the previous camp. A shocked Aluko asked for examples. Sampson told her she had been withdrawn and that her behaviour differed depending on whether or not she was in the starting lineup. Aluko hasn\u2019t played for England since.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"725d1227b90b6473d46928a2f4d6adcca127de64\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/725d1227b90b6473d46928a2f4d6adcca127de64/0_19_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eniola Aluko gives evidence to the digital, culture, media and sport committee in October 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aluko gives evidence to the digital, culture, media and sport committee in October 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She was convinced she had been dropped because Sampson had found out about the supposedly confidential culture review. In June, she wrote to the FA with a grievance report. In August 2016, the head of elite development finally replied, insisting the two were unrelated. The FA told her it would investigate her allegations, but at the same time announced that its Integrity Unit was investigating a consultancy role Aluko had with a football agency. The FA concluded that she would have to stop working for the agency or quit football, because she was in breach of \u201cFA intermediary roles\u201d. Aluko argued there was no conflict of interest, but surrendered her paid role.</p> <p>She began to think she wasn\u2019t simply involved in a spat with the England management, but that she was at war with the FA. And, as far as Aluko was concerned, the FA was playing dirty.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Aluko calls herself an accidental whistleblower. She never planned to sacrifice her career on the altar of justice; she just planned to alert the confidential review to inappropriate behaviour. In a way, she says, all she has ever wanted to do is quietly conform and get on with playing football. But Aluko has always stood out.</p> <p>Her parents, Sileola and Daniel, moved the family from Lagos to Birmingham when Aluko was six months old. Daniel returned to Nigeria to pursue a career in politics, while Sileola worked first as a nurse and then for a pharmaceutical company, bringing up her children in England. From the age of five, Aluko was the only girl on her estate who played football. She and her younger brother, Sone, also a professional footballer, spent their free time honing their skills. Until she went to secondary school, she says, she never had a female friend. Her football-playing male friends called her Eddie, because it was a bit easier than Eni and a lot easier than Eniola.</p> <p>Some parents were hostile to Aluko playing football \u2013 particularly as she was better than their sons. The young Eni was told she was different from all the other girls. She knows she should have been proud, but she felt crushed. \u201cIf I was talking to my young self, I\u2019d say: don\u2019t be afraid to be individual. Because I was afraid to be different. When the parents at school said: \u2018Why\u2019s a girl playing football?\u2019 it made me feel alien.\u201d</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t only football ability that differentiated the Alukos. While the other children on the estate spoke with a broad Brummy accent, Sileola insisted Eni and Sone spoke the Queen\u2019s English. They might have been living a working-class life, but they did not have working-class roots. In Nigeria, their father had become a prominent politician. Meanwhile, at school, she began to learn how complex prejudice can be. \u201cI didn\u2019t get racism from the white girls, but I got really bad bullying from the black Caribbean girls who saw something in me that they didn\u2019t understand. They used to call me \u2018African bhuttu\u2019, which was patois for unsophisticated. And they called me \u2018Coconut\u2019 because I spoke well and hung around with white people.\u201d</p> <p>At the age of 15, she joined Birmingham City Ladies, where her coach Marcus Bignot labelled her the \u201cWayne Rooney of women\u2019s football\u201d; like Rooney, she was short and muscular with an explosive burst of pace. That year, she was called up to the England youth squad. At her first camp, her skills made her stand out. \u201cI flicked the ball over somebody\u2019s head, brought it down and did a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYtzf7YD8oY\" title=\"\">Cruyff turn</a> and Hope Powell [Sampson\u2019s predecessor at England] stopped the session and said: \u2018It\u2019s not the Eni show.\u2019 I remember thinking: well, I\u2019m not going to do that again. I\u2019ll just get it and pass it.\u201d Now she says she wishes she had followed her instincts \u2013 it would have made her a better player. For her, that was a big difference between the boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 games \u2013 while boys were encouraged to nurture their individuality, girls were scolded for it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8c110a7ebd499116f4a1ea302f2955dd768100b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c110a7ebd499116f4a1ea302f2955dd768100b8/0_0_5478_7304/750.jpg\" alt=\"Eniola Aluko\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aluko was once labelled the \u2018Wayne Rooney of women\u2019s football\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Perou/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite that desire to conform, there was already something unusually forthright about her. After discovering her cousin Fola had become a high-flying lawyer in New York, and reading <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/16/robert-mccrum-100-best-novels-harper-lee-to-kill-a-mockingbird\" title=\"\">To Kill A Mockingbird</a>, she decided she wanted to become Atticus Finch and save lives. By then, Aluko says, she saw an injustice lurking on every corner. A boy in her class was bullied for his afro. Rather than defending him, the school banned afros. Aluko was outraged \u2013 not least because one boy had long, dyed-green hair and nothing was said about it. She went to see the headteacher, who heard her out and told her she was changing the rules \u2013 enforcing short hair for all the boys. It taught her that justice doesn\u2019t always look the way you want it to. That Christmas, the school awarded her a special prize for speaking up for others.</p> <p>***</p> <p>After Aluko put her grievance into writing in 2016, an internal investigation cleared Sampson and the management team of any wrongdoing. Aluko threatened to take the FA to court. The FA held a second investigation, this time hiring the barrister Katharine Newton to examine the evidence. In March 2017, it again cleared Sampson and his staff of wrongdoing, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/aug/17/eni-aluko-hush-money-case-fa-bows-to-pressure-and-reveals-findings\" title=\"\">Aluko was paid \u00a380,000 in an out-of-court settlement</a>.</p> <p>In August that year, the findings were leaked to the Daily Mail, along with information about the settlement. Aluko was horrified by the way she was portrayed. The Mail did not mention the racism, only that Aluko had made allegations of bullying and harassment against Sampson and his staff. It suggested that the FA paid her the money only because it wanted to avoid disruption in the buildup to Euro 2017, that she was making problems because she had lost her place in the squad, and that her teammates didn\u2019t like her. In fact, the payout was for loss of earnings.</p> <p>As for the report itself, Aluko calls it a shambles. \u201cIt basically said: \u2018Eni lied about racism. Mark Sampson never said anything racist. The team is very happy. We\u2019ve interviewed a lot of players, and they say it\u2019s a great culture.\u2019\u201d How did she feel when she saw it? \u201cI was gutted. <em>Gutted</em>. I was publicly being called a liar.\u201d</p> <p>Does she think the FA set out to destroy her? She nods. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t about Mark Sampson any more. It was about Eni Aluko versus the FA \u2013 David versus Goliath. The PR machine of the FA was \u2018Make Eni look as bad as possible\u2019. It was a smear campaign.\u201d</p> <p>Did anything ring true? Well, she says, the report was accurate that she had become withdrawn. \u201cI\u2019m an optimistic, positive person normally, but I was miserable during that time. You have a lot of downtime on England camps, so I was in my room on my own trying to get through it. I didn\u2019t really socialise with anybody.\u201d How did she cope? \u201cI have a strong faith in God. I\u2019d watch stuff from my favourite preachers about opposition and how to face adversity.\u201d Did she lose faith at any point? \u201cNo, I think my faith got stronger, because in that period that\u2019s all I had.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>In August 2017, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/aug/21/eni-aluko-england-manager-mark-sampson-ebola\" title=\"\">Aluko told her side of the story to Daniel Taylor of the Guardian</a> (she is now a columnist for the sports pages of this paper). She revealed that Sampson had made the Ebola comment and asked an unnamed mixed-race England player how many times she had been arrested. A month later, Spence told the FA that she was the player in question and that everything Aluko had said was true. The Professional Footballers\u2019 Association called for a new investigation, accusing the FA of holding a \u201csham\u201d review that was \u201cnot designed to establish the truth, but intended to protect Mark Sampson\u201d.</p> <p>Five days after Spence came forward, England played Russia. Every member of the team raced to the bench to celebrate with Sampson after Nikita Parris scored the opener for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/19/england-women-russia-world-cup-qualifying-match-report\" title=\"\">England in a 6-0 win</a>. Aluko says that was when she finally cracked. \u201cI cried my eyes out when I saw that. Players can celebrate how they want, but in the midst of the case I just thought it was too much. I felt really, really low at that point.\u201d</p> <p>A day later, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/20/mark-sampson-leave-england-womens-manager\" title=\"\">the FA sacked Sampson</a> out of the blue, stressing that it was nothing to do with the racism allegations. It emerged that he was forced out because of a relationship he had had with a player three years earlier when he was managing Bristol Academy. In January 2019, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/09/fa-settlement-mark-sampson-former-england-womens-manager\" title=\"\">Sampson received a payout from the FA</a> for unfair dismissal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"abcbc6073b18597bc305710a0c6eca14be9458ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/abcbc6073b18597bc305710a0c6eca14be9458ad/0_2130_5444_3514/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eniola Aluko\" width=\"1000\" height=\"645\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aluko says she is comforted by the number of female footballers who have spoken out in the past couple of years.

While stressing that she did not regard Sampson as a racist, Newton said: \u201cI have concluded that, on two separate occasions, Sampson has made ill-judged attempts at humour, which, as a matter of law, were discriminatory on the grounds of race within the meaning of the Equality Act 2010.\u201d The FA apologised to Aluko and Spence.</p> <p>A month later, the FA was accused of a cover-up after saying that Kendall would not face action, while concealing the fact that he had admitted putting on a mock Caribbean accent to Aluko. Kendall resigned as goalkeeping coach and apologised to her.</p> <p>This January, 16 months after losing his job, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/21/mark-sampson-england-women-apologies-eni-aluko-drew-spence\" title=\"\">Sampson also apologised to Aluko and Spence</a>, saying: \u201cAs a white male, I needed to do more and I\u2019ve worked hard to educate myself. I spent six weeks with Kick It Out on their educational course for equality and diversity. I need to play a more active role in making a difference. It\u2019s something I will do for the rest of my life.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>How did Aluko feel when she read the final report? \u201cElated. Vindicated.\u201d Since the FA\u2019s apology, she says, they have been building bridges. \u201cAfter the case, they asked me to be part of the recommendations with UK Sport to build whistleblowing procedures.\u201d Where possible, she says, she wants to forgive. \u201cForgiveness is an action, a decision. I had a decision to make. Am I going to hold on to a lot of this pain and frustration with how they treated me, or am I going to try to build a lasting relationship that will impact change moving forward? I had the opportunity to try to do something that was positive with the FA and I did that.\u201d</p> <p>Have fellow players apologised to her? Silence. \u201cErm\u2026 a few of the Chelsea girls have, yeah.\u201d She mentions her former Chelsea teammates Fran Kirby and Karen Carney \u2013 close friends and women she hugely respects. As for Spence, Aluko says their relationship is stronger than ever. \u201cDrew is somebody I probably speak to every other day \u2013 more than anyone else in football.\u201d But Aluko is less forgiving towards members of the squad for not supporting her. \u201cTo this day, Steph Houghton and a lot of leaders in that team have not come out and apologised to me for what I went through. People say: \u2018D\u2019you want them to sacrifice their careers for you?\u2019 No, I don\u2019t. But I do expect a team of people to say: we do not share these values, we do not accept that what the manager said was correct.\u201d She bangs the table as she talks.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This summer I was doing media at the World Cup. But I\u2019m only 32 and I could have played</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Would she go for a drink with them now? \u201cNo. With quite a few of them, categorically no. Because what they represent is fundamentally the opposite to me.\u201d In what way? \u201cJust not being able to come out and say: for my teammate to go through this, for racism to be even talked about in this team, is unacceptable.\u201d</p> <p>In June 2018, Aluko left England to play for Juventus. She has enjoyed a hugely successful year there \u2013 winning the league and cup double, finishing the season as the club\u2019s top scorer. But, despite her impressive form, Aluko did not make the England squad for this year\u2019s World Cup.</p> <p>Does she ever think how differently life might have turned out if she had kept her mouth shut? \u201cYes. This summer I was doing media at the World Cup. But I\u2019m only 32 and I could have played. I think my England career would have lasted longer than it did. At the point I decided to tell the story, I knew it was going to cost me my England career.\u201d</p> <p>She pauses, then says something surprising. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a very powerful position to be in.\u201d Why? \u201cBecause a lot of players, all they can think about is their pay cheque and the fact that they want to play football, so they don\u2019t say anything. So they don\u2019t end up leaving any legacy for the next person who comes along, and it\u2019s going to happen to them, too. I would like to think that, next time a player complains about something going on, and not just a black player, it won\u2019t be accepted.\u201d</p> <p>One thing that has comforted her is the number of female footballers who have spoken out in the past couple of years. \u201cI\u2019m not going to take credit for this, but, since my case, both the Australia and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jul/31/new-zealand-womens-football-coach-resigns-amid-alleged-toxic-culture\" title=\"\">New Zealand women\u2019s teams</a> have publicly complained about the culture of fear; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/mar/09/will-the-us-womens-soccer-team-win-their-battle-for-equal-pay\" title=\"\">the American women\u2019s team are in an equal pay dispute</a> and probably going to win. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/08/aga-hegerberg-the-ballon-dor-was-an-amazing-night-for-women\" title=\"\">Ada Hegerberg</a>, Norway\u2019s top player and the best player in the world, said: \u2018I don\u2019t like the way things are happening [regarding unequal pay]. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jul/03/lyon-ada-hegerberg-ronaldo-champions-league-goals\" title=\"\">I\u2019m not playing in the World Cup</a>.\u2019 There are many examples of women standing up and saying: we\u2019re not having this any more.\u201d</p> <p>Unfortunately, this list includes few of her former teammates. Not surprisingly, she says, they now seem uncomfortable when they see her.</p> <p>Will she ever make up with them? Aluko shakes her head. \u201cI don\u2019t need to. My life has moved on. Everybody knows what I stand for. That is far more powerful than being an England player who puts on an England shirt and plays well.\u201d As much as the England management and the FA, Aluko feels bitterly betrayed by her own colleagues. \u201cI would much rather be where I\u2019m sat than where they\u2019re sat, because people question them to this day. People say it to me all the time: \u2018I find it difficult to support the women\u2019s team because of how they behaved.\u2019 We all have moments in life when our fundamental morals are called into question. In the face of what happened to me, they did nothing. People remember that.\u201d</p> <h2>An exclusive extract from Aluko\u2019s memoir: \u2018No one could teach me how to navigate this hyphenated identity\u2019</h2> <p>It was being called up to play for England that made me understand I wasn\u2019t officially British. Not yet, at least. Not on paper.</p> <p>A few months after I joined the youth team of Birmingham City Ladies, in 2001, we were scheduled to play a tournament in Warwick, and our coach Marcus Bignot told us England scouts would be there. The final whistle blew on the tournament and I jogged over to my dad, who was visiting from Nigeria. One of the scouts approached, told me I\u2019d played well, took my details and said he\u2019d be in touch. That was it.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t long before the first letter from England landed on our doorstep. \u201cMum!\u201d I called out. \u201cEngland want me to go to an under-15s trial!\u201d Later, she got the letter framed and hung it in the hallway. I think she saw it as something that anchored us even deeper in the UK; one of us could be representing the country.</p> <p>The trial was at Loughborough University. As the date approached, Mum started to worry about what I was going to wear. Appearances have always been important to her. I told her I\u2019d just wear my training stuff, but she wouldn\u2019t hear of it. The week before the trial, we went shopping and bought a pencil skirt, a collared shirt, a suit jacket and high heels to match.</p> <p>The day came and Mum drove me up to Loughborough. Parents were invited to stay for a short introductory briefing with the manager, Hope Powell. We pulled into the car park and I spotted a couple of other girls walking into the building.</p> <p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d I said, horrified. \u201cThey\u2019re all wearing tracksuits.\u201d</p> <p>We stepped inside the building, my stomach doing backflips. Thirty or 40 girls sat with their parents, every one of them in a tracksuit and trainers. I swear I heard a murmur ripple around the room, as the girls looked round and nudged each other. I lowered my head and clip-clopped over to a seat in the far back corner. A few minutes later, Powell walked into the room and launched into a business-like introduction. I didn\u2019t hear a word she said. The second the talk was over, I jumped up and ran off to change into my training gear. I\u2019ve never lived it down.</p> <p>A few weeks later, a letter arrived saying I\u2019d been picked for a week-long camp. I scanned the letter and took it into the kitchen to show to Mum. I began reading it out loud, then I stopped. \u201cOh no,\u201d I said. \u201cMum, they want me to bring my passport. What are we going to do?\u201d Mum frowned. She had applied to make us all British citizens, but the paperwork, the checks, the tests \u2013 it all took a long time. It had never crossed my mind I would need to be naturalised as British to play for England. We had \u201cleave to remain\u201d, which meant we could stay in the country as long as we wanted.</p> <p>I felt entirely British. I\u2019d lived in England my whole life; it was the only home I knew. I was so tired of being the odd one out. I felt a familiar despair rising, one I was coming to associate with my British-Nigerian identity.</p> <p>Passports were a big deal for the Nigerian community in the UK. A red British passport was a prized possession for those who had been in the UK long enough to own one alongside the Nigerian document, known as a green pali. To hold a British passport was a gateway to the world. Mum mentioned our problem to Dad, to her Nigerian friends and family. \u201cListen,\u201d said one uncle, who liked to flaunt that he was a British citizen by birth. \u201cIf she dares show up with green pali, they\u2019ll send that child straight back. She has to be <em>Britico</em> now, don\u2019t you know that?\u201d</p> <p>I felt like an alien in my own country. If I wasn\u2019t British, then what was I? I thought back to my last visit to Nigeria. I felt like a foreigner there, too.</p> <p>Every day I\u2019d wake up and hope the document would drop on to the doormat. Every day it wasn\u2019t there and the camp was another day nearer.</p> <p>In the end, I took an acknowledgement from the Home Office proving Mum had applied for naturalisation, together with a note she wrote. It was all we had. Thankfully, the coaches were more relaxed than expected.</p> <p>A few months later, my passport finally arrived. Mum emptied the burgundy books out on to the table, alongside our Nigerian documents. \u201cNow you can travel wherever you want,\u201d she said.</p> <p>I saw for the first time what this process meant. Getting a red passport was more than a formality. It was about status. She had been an adult when she first came to the UK, and all this time she had been a foreigner. She had worked hard to forge new paths for herself and her children. I turned over the little red book in my hand and stroked the gold coat of arms on the front. I picked out my old Nigerian passport and held it in my other hand. Two passports, two identities.</p> <p>No one could teach me how to navigate this hyphenated identity. For me, being British-Nigerian is a tightrope I\u2019ll be on for the rest of my life. And whenever I wobble, or feel others are trying to pull me in one direction or the other, I grab on to my hyphen and remember I\u2019ll always be both.</p> <p><em>\u2022 They Don\u2019t Teach This</em><em> by Eniola Aluko is published by Yellow Jersey Press (\u00a314.99).

      "bodyText": "Eniola Aluko is one of only 11 female footballers to have played more than 100 times for England. She has scored some of the Lionesses\u2019 most memorable goals, was the first female pundit on Match Of The Day, and is a qualified lawyer, having graduated from Brunel University London with a first in 2008. But it is as a whistleblower that she is destined to be best remembered. And, like many whistleblowers, she has spent the subsequent years being rubbished by those she exposed. Now she has written a memoir. They Don\u2019t Teach This is a fascinating examination of her multiple identities \u2013 British and Nigerian, a girl in a boy\u2019s world, footballer and academic, a kid from an estate with upper-middle-class parents, a God-fearing rebel. But the book is at its best when she reveals exactly what happened after she accused the England management team of racism, and the Football Association of turning a blind eye to it. Aluko does not hold back \u2013 and few people from the football establishment emerge with their reputation intact. Aluko now plays for Juventus in Italy, but we meet at her old stomping ground, Brunel. She has been delayed by traffic, which gives me time to explore the sports centre. On the wall are three huge, framed posters of Brunel alumni \u2013 sporting legends. Guess who they are, I say to Aluko when she arrives. \u201cMo Farah, definitely,\u201d she says instantly. And? \u201cErm\u2026 oh, Usain Bolt! Obviously! He trained here.\u201d And the third? She is stumped. Then she looks. \u201cOh. My. God!\u201d It is a poster of her playing for England. \u201cWow! That\u2019s amazing.\u201d She looks genuinely thrilled. Aluko has a small, mobile face with striking features \u2013 big, brown eyes and a huge, ear-to-ear smile. When she is unhappy, she makes no attempt to hide it; her glare is as forbidding as the smile is winning. And there haven\u2019t been many times over the past five years that Aluko has had reason to smile. It all started in January 2014, barely a month after Mark Sampson took over as manager of the Lionesses. Sampson was 30 years old, an inexperienced coach who had never played professional football. At 28, Aluko was virtually an England veteran, a first-team regular and a popular member of the squad who had used her legal skills to champion teammates \u2013 notably helping to draw up a new central contract for the team. The striker was also a conscientious player, always keen to improve her game. Her desire to better herself led to her taking advantage of a new system that enabled players to watch back games and analyse their own performance, while hearing the audio from the management team. After a match against Finland, a 3-1 win for England in which Aluko had scored a goal and made another, she reviewed the footage. Aluko had been pleased with her performance \u2013 which made it more shocking when she heard the audio. \u201cThe goalkeeping coach Lee Kendall said: \u2018Eni is lazy as fuck,\u2019 and: \u2018She\u2019s not fit enough.\u2019 Then, when I lost the ball, he said: \u2018Oh, fuck off, Eni,\u2019\u201d she tells me. She heard no disparaging remarks about other players, nor any positive comments when she scored and assisted a goal. Aluko was confused. She was in the form of her life, with six goals in six games for England. And, more to the point, she says, she had never been called lazy before. \u201cAt the time, I didn\u2019t think too deeply about what was being said. I was just like: why is this being said about me on a portal that everyone can access? Then I started thinking about where has this come from.\u201d The more she thought about it, the more convinced she became that there was a racial connotation. \u201cLook, lazy is a generic term. Anybody can be called lazy if you\u2019re not tracking back. But if you\u2019re black and you\u2019re called lazy, it\u2019s different. Some words have real context to them, and this dates back to slavery times. In that split second, I\u2019m sure Lee Kendall didn\u2019t think about racial connotations, but that\u2019s what racism can be.\u201d One coach spoke to her in a fake Caribbean accent. \u2018I was tempted to speak to him in a Scottish accent, despite knowing he was Welsh.\u2019 Aluko is fully aware, as are most football fans of a certain age, how charged the word \u201clazy\u201d is in relation to black footballers. In 2004, the former Manchester United manager Ron Atkinson was sacked as a pundit on ITV (and as a Guardian columnist) after a microphone picked him up saying the French defender Marcel Desailly \u201cis what is known in some schools as a fucking lazy thick nigger\u201d. Aluko knew Kendall\u2019s comment bore no comparison, but she couldn\u2019t help thinking about it. She started to feel the management team had it in for her, but kept stumm. What Kendall had said was unpleasant, but it would be virtually impossible to prove it was anything more. If they didn\u2019t like her, she would show her worth on the pitch. And she did, finishing joint top scorer among all nations competing for qualification for the European Championships in 2015, with 13 goals. But the comments continued \u2013 now to her face. In November 2014, she told Sampson that her family was flying in from Nigeria for a friendly against Germany. He replied: \u201cWell, make sure they don\u2019t come over with Ebola.\u201d (Sampson denied saying this for a long time after.) Aluko says she laughed nervously but was left reeling. She told her England teammate Lianne Sanderson, but said she wasn\u2019t going to make a big deal of it. She wanted to focus on her football. At one point, Kendall, a close friend of Sampson, started speaking to her in a fake Caribbean accent. It infuriated Aluko \u2013 not least because she isn\u2019t from the Caribbean. \u201cI was often tempted to speak to him in a Scottish accent, despite knowing he was Welsh, just to make the point.\u201d Then she started to notice other things happening to black members of the squad. In October 2015, Chelsea\u2019s midfielder Drew Spence was called up to the England squad for the first time, for a trip to China. Spence told Aluko that, in a meeting of midfielders, Sampson turned to the newcomer and said: \u201cHaven\u2019t you been arrested before, then? Four times, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Spence was the only non-white player in the room and has never been arrested. After making these remarks, Sampson never picked her again for England; she still has only two caps. A few days later, the midfielder Jill Scott was feted when she won her 100th cap against Australia \u2013 speeches were made, she captained the team, a video message was played from her family. In the same match, Sanderson won her 50th cap \u2013 another considerable milestone, normally celebrated with a special shirt \u2013 but this was ignored. Sanderson told Aluko she was devastated; with Aluko\u2019s encouragement, she told Sampson how upset she was, but asked him not to make an issue of it in front of the team. The following day, he addressed the squad, said he had made a mistake in not acknowledging her 50th cap and presented her with a special shirt. Sanderson was never selected for England again. While Sampson did not drop Aluko, he told her repeatedly that he couldn\u2019t rely on her, that she lacked stamina and heart, that she was selfish and didn\u2019t play for the team. After Aluko scored a hat-trick in a 10-0 thrashing of Montenegro, Sampson presented her with the ball, telling the team: \u201cWe all know Eni is a pain in the arse, but she did well to score a hat-trick after I gave her the target of scoring five goals today.\u201d Aluko was still reluctant to draw attention to Sampson\u2019s behaviour. \u201cAs black players, you don\u2019t always want to be bringing these issues up. You want to just play football. You know that the accusations of \u2018playing the race card\u2019 are going to come up. So I would bite my tongue. I\u2019d see the level of ignorance, roll my eyes and get on with it.\u201d And so it continued. Aluko says the only thing that kept her going was her desperation to reach 100 caps \u2013 and become the first British-African woman to do so. When it finally happened, in February 2016, the occasion was soured by Sampson. She says he refused to give her advanced notice she would be playing, so she could invite her family. Then, on the morning of the match, Sampson told her she wasn\u2019t in the starting 11 because he wanted to field his strongest team. In the end, he brought her on in the second half and the captain, Steph Houghton, handed her the captain\u2019s band. But by then she was inconsolable. Three months later, in May 2016, the FA invited Aluko to participate in a confidential \u201cculture review\u201d about her experiences as a black woman in the England team. She agreed to a phone interview in which she said that she felt demoralised, and that under Sampson\u2019s management her negative experiences outweighed the positive ones. Twelve days later, she was visited by Sampson at Chelsea\u2019s ground and told she was being dropped from the England squad for \u201cun-Lionness behaviour\u201d and a bad attitude in the previous camp. A shocked Aluko asked for examples. Sampson told her she had been withdrawn and that her behaviour differed depending on whether or not she was in the starting lineup. Aluko hasn\u2019t played for England since. She was convinced she had been dropped because Sampson had found out about the supposedly confidential culture review. In June, she wrote to the FA with a grievance report. In August 2016, the head of elite development finally replied, insisting the two were unrelated. The FA told her it would investigate her allegations, but at the same time announced that its Integrity Unit was investigating a consultancy role Aluko had with a football agency. The FA concluded that she would have to stop working for the agency or quit football, because she was in breach of \u201cFA intermediary roles\u201d. Aluko argued there was no conflict of interest, but surrendered her paid role. She began to think she wasn\u2019t simply involved in a spat with the England management, but that she was at war with the FA. And, as far as Aluko was concerned, the FA was playing dirty. *** Aluko calls herself an accidental whistleblower. She never planned to sacrifice her career on the altar of justice; she just planned to alert the confidential review to inappropriate behaviour. In a way, she says, all she has ever wanted to do is quietly conform and get on with playing football. But Aluko has always stood out. Her parents, Sileola and Daniel, moved the family from Lagos to Birmingham when Aluko was six months old. Daniel returned to Nigeria to pursue a career in politics, while Sileola worked first as a nurse and then for a pharmaceutical company, bringing up her children in England. From the age of five, Aluko was the only girl on her estate who played football. She and her younger brother, Sone, also a professional footballer, spent their free time honing their skills. Until she went to secondary school, she says, she never had a female friend. Her football-playing male friends called her Eddie, because it was a bit easier than Eni and a lot easier than Eniola. Some parents were hostile to Aluko playing football \u2013 particularly as she was better than their sons. The young Eni was told she was different from all the other girls. She knows she should have been proud, but she felt crushed. \u201cIf I was talking to my young self, I\u2019d say: don\u2019t be afraid to be individual. Because I was afraid to be different. When the parents at school said: \u2018Why\u2019s a girl playing football?\u2019 it made me feel alien.\u201d It wasn\u2019t only football ability that differentiated the Alukos. While the other children on the estate spoke with a broad Brummy accent, Sileola insisted Eni and Sone spoke the Queen\u2019s English. They might have been living a working-class life, but they did not have working-class roots. In Nigeria, their father had become a prominent politician. Meanwhile, at school, she began to learn how complex prejudice can be. \u201cI didn\u2019t get racism from the white girls, but I got really bad bullying from the black Caribbean girls who saw something in me that they didn\u2019t understand. They used to call me \u2018African bhuttu\u2019, which was patois for unsophisticated. And they called me \u2018Coconut\u2019 because I spoke well and hung around with white people.\u201d At the age of 15, she joined Birmingham City Ladies, where her coach Marcus Bignot labelled her the \u201cWayne Rooney of women\u2019s football\u201d; like Rooney, she was short and muscular with an explosive burst of pace. That year, she was called up to the England youth squad. At her first camp, her skills made her stand out. \u201cI flicked the ball over somebody\u2019s head, brought it down and did a Cruyff turn and Hope Powell [Sampson\u2019s predecessor at England] stopped the session and said: \u2018It\u2019s not the Eni show.\u2019 I remember thinking: well, I\u2019m not going to do that again. I\u2019ll just get it and pass it.\u201d Now she says she wishes she had followed her instincts \u2013 it would have made her a better player. For her, that was a big difference between the boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 games \u2013 while boys were encouraged to nurture their individuality, girls were scolded for it. Despite that desire to conform, there was already something unusually forthright about her. After discovering her cousin Fola had become a high-flying lawyer in New York, and reading To Kill A Mockingbird, she decided she wanted to become Atticus Finch and save lives. By then, Aluko says, she saw an injustice lurking on every corner. A boy in her class was bullied for his afro. Rather than defending him, the school banned afros. Aluko was outraged \u2013 not least because one boy had long, dyed-green hair and nothing was said about it. She went to see the headteacher, who heard her out and told her she was changing the rules \u2013 enforcing short hair for all the boys. It taught her that justice doesn\u2019t always look the way you want it to. That Christmas, the school awarded her a special prize for speaking up for others. *** After Aluko put her grievance into writing in 2016, an internal investigation cleared Sampson and the management team of any wrongdoing. Aluko threatened to take the FA to court. The FA held a second investigation, this time hiring the barrister Katharine Newton to examine the evidence. In March 2017, it again cleared Sampson and his staff of wrongdoing, but Aluko was paid \u00a380,000 in an out-of-court settlement. In August that year, the findings were leaked to the Daily Mail, along with information about the settlement. Aluko was horrified by the way she was portrayed. The Mail did not mention the racism, only that Aluko had made allegations of bullying and harassment against Sampson and his staff. It suggested that the FA paid her the money only because it wanted to avoid disruption in the buildup to Euro 2017, that she was making problems because she had lost her place in the squad, and that her teammates didn\u2019t like her. In fact, the payout was for loss of earnings. As for the report itself, Aluko calls it a shambles. \u201cIt basically said: \u2018Eni lied about racism. Mark Sampson never said anything racist. The team is very happy. We\u2019ve interviewed a lot of players, and they say it\u2019s a great culture.\u2019\u201d How did she feel when she saw it? \u201cI was gutted. Gutted. I was publicly being called a liar.\u201d Does she think the FA set out to destroy her? She nods. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t about Mark Sampson any more. It was about Eni Aluko versus the FA \u2013 David versus Goliath. The PR machine of the FA was \u2018Make Eni look as bad as possible\u2019. It was a smear campaign.\u201d Did anything ring true? Well, she says, the report was accurate that she had become withdrawn. \u201cI\u2019m an optimistic, positive person normally, but I was miserable during that time. You have a lot of downtime on England camps, so I was in my room on my own trying to get through it. I didn\u2019t really socialise with anybody.\u201d How did she cope? \u201cI have a strong faith in God. I\u2019d watch stuff from my favourite preachers about opposition and how to face adversity.\u201d Did she lose faith at any point? \u201cNo, I think my faith got stronger, because in that period that\u2019s all I had.\u201d *** In August 2017, Aluko told her side of the story to Daniel Taylor of the Guardian (she is now a columnist for the sports pages of this paper). She revealed that Sampson had made the Ebola comment and asked an unnamed mixed-race England player how many times she had been arrested. A month later, Spence told the FA that she was the player in question and that everything Aluko had said was true. The Professional Footballers\u2019 Association called for a new investigation, accusing the FA of holding a \u201csham\u201d review that was \u201cnot designed to establish the truth, but intended to protect Mark Sampson\u201d. Five days after Spence came forward, England played Russia. Every member of the team raced to the bench to celebrate with Sampson after Nikita Parris scored the opener for England in a 6-0 win. Aluko says that was when she finally cracked. \u201cI cried my eyes out when I saw that. Players can celebrate how they want, but in the midst of the case I just thought it was too much. I felt really, really low at that point.\u201d A day later, the FA sacked Sampson out of the blue, stressing that it was nothing to do with the racism allegations. It emerged that he was forced out because of a relationship he had had with a player three years earlier when he was managing Bristol Academy. In January 2019, Sampson received a payout from the FA for unfair dismissal. A third investigation was ordered into Aluko\u2019s allegations and, in October 2017, Newton concluded that Sampson had racially abused Aluko and Spence. While stressing that she did not regard Sampson as a racist, Newton said: \u201cI have concluded that, on two separate occasions, Sampson has made ill-judged attempts at humour, which, as a matter of law, were discriminatory on the grounds of race within the meaning of the Equality Act 2010.\u201d The FA apologised to Aluko and Spence. A month later, the FA was accused of a cover-up after saying that Kendall would not face action, while concealing the fact that he had admitted putting on a mock Caribbean accent to Aluko. Kendall resigned as goalkeeping coach and apologised to her. This January, 16 months after losing his job, Sampson also apologised to Aluko and Spence, saying: \u201cAs a white male, I needed to do more and I\u2019ve worked hard to educate myself. I spent six weeks with Kick It Out on their educational course for equality and diversity. I need to play a more active role in making a difference. It\u2019s something I will do for the rest of my life.\u201d *** How did Aluko feel when she read the final report? \u201cElated. Vindicated.\u201d Since the FA\u2019s apology, she says, they have been building bridges. \u201cAfter the case, they asked me to be part of the recommendations with UK Sport to build whistleblowing procedures.\u201d Where possible, she says, she wants to forgive. \u201cForgiveness is an action, a decision. I had a decision to make. Am I going to hold on to a lot of this pain and frustration with how they treated me, or am I going to try to build a lasting relationship that will impact change moving forward? I had the opportunity to try to do something that was positive with the FA and I did that.\u201d Have fellow players apologised to her? Silence. \u201cErm\u2026 a few of the Chelsea girls have, yeah.\u201d She mentions her former Chelsea teammates Fran Kirby and Karen Carney \u2013 close friends and women she hugely respects. As for Spence, Aluko says their relationship is stronger than ever. \u201cDrew is somebody I probably speak to every other day \u2013 more than anyone else in football.\u201d But Aluko is less forgiving towards members of the squad for not supporting her. \u201cTo this day, Steph Houghton and a lot of leaders in that team have not come out and apologised to me for what I went through. People say: \u2018D\u2019you want them to sacrifice their careers for you?\u2019 No, I don\u2019t. But I do expect a team of people to say: we do not share these values, we do not accept that what the manager said was correct.\u201d She bangs the table as she talks. Would she go for a drink with them now? \u201cNo. With quite a few of them, categorically no. Because what they represent is fundamentally the opposite to me.\u201d In what way? \u201cJust not being able to come out and say: for my teammate to go through this, for racism to be even talked about in this team, is unacceptable.\u201d In June 2018, Aluko left England to play for Juventus. She has enjoyed a hugely successful year there \u2013 winning the league and cup double, finishing the season as the club\u2019s top scorer. But, despite her impressive form, Aluko did not make the England squad for this year\u2019s World Cup. Does she ever think how differently life might have turned out if she had kept her mouth shut? \u201cYes. This summer I was doing media at the World Cup. But I\u2019m only 32 and I could have played. I think my England career would have lasted longer than it did. At the point I decided to tell the story, I knew it was going to cost me my England career.\u201d She pauses, then says something surprising. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a very powerful position to be in.\u201d Why? \u201cBecause a lot of players, all they can think about is their pay cheque and the fact that they want to play football, so they don\u2019t say anything. So they don\u2019t end up leaving any legacy for the next person who comes along, and it\u2019s going to happen to them, too. I would like to think that, next time a player complains about something going on, and not just a black player, it won\u2019t be accepted.\u201d One thing that has comforted her is the number of female footballers who have spoken out in the past couple of years. \u201cI\u2019m not going to take credit for this, but, since my case, both the Australia and New Zealand women\u2019s teams have publicly complained about the culture of fear; the American women\u2019s team are in an equal pay dispute and probably going to win. Ada Hegerberg, Norway\u2019s top player and the best player in the world, said: \u2018I don\u2019t like the way things are happening [regarding unequal pay]. I\u2019m not playing in the World Cup.\u2019 There are many examples of women standing up and saying: we\u2019re not having this any more.\u201d Unfortunately, this list includes few of her former teammates. Not surprisingly, she says, they now seem uncomfortable when they see her. Will she ever make up with them? Aluko shakes her head. \u201cI don\u2019t need to. My life has moved on. Everybody knows what I stand for. That is far more powerful than being an England player who puts on an England shirt and plays well.\u201d As much as the England management and the FA, Aluko feels bitterly betrayed by her own colleagues. \u201cI would much rather be where I\u2019m sat than where they\u2019re sat, because people question them to this day. People say it to me all the time: \u2018I find it difficult to support the women\u2019s team because of how they behaved.\u2019 We all have moments in life when our fundamental morals are called into question. In the face of what happened to me, they did nothing. People remember that.\u201d An exclusive extract from Aluko\u2019s memoir: \u2018No one could teach me how to navigate this hyphenated identity\u2019 It was being called up to play for England that made me understand I wasn\u2019t officially British. Not yet, at least. Not on paper. A few months after I joined the youth team of Birmingham City Ladies, in 2001, we were scheduled to play a tournament in Warwick, and our coach Marcus Bignot told us England scouts would be there. The final whistle blew on the tournament and I jogged over to my dad, who was visiting from Nigeria. One of the scouts approached, told me I\u2019d played well, took my details and said he\u2019d be in touch. That was it. It wasn\u2019t long before the first letter from England landed on our doorstep. \u201cMum!\u201d I called out. \u201cEngland want me to go to an under-15s trial!\u201d Later, she got the letter framed and hung it in the hallway. I think she saw it as something that anchored us even deeper in the UK; one of us could be representing the country. The trial was at Loughborough University. As the date approached, Mum started to worry about what I was going to wear. Appearances have always been important to her. I told her I\u2019d just wear my training stuff, but she wouldn\u2019t hear of it. The week before the trial, we went shopping and bought a pencil skirt, a collared shirt, a suit jacket and high heels to match. The day came and Mum drove me up to Loughborough. Parents were invited to stay for a short introductory briefing with the manager, Hope Powell. We pulled into the car park and I spotted a couple of other girls walking into the building. \u201cOh, God,\u201d I said, horrified. \u201cThey\u2019re all wearing tracksuits.\u201d We stepped inside the building, my stomach doing backflips. Thirty or 40 girls sat with their parents, every one of them in a tracksuit and trainers. I swear I heard a murmur ripple around the room, as the girls looked round and nudged each other. I lowered my head and clip-clopped over to a seat in the far back corner. A few minutes later, Powell walked into the room and launched into a business-like introduction. I didn\u2019t hear a word she said. The second the talk was over, I jumped up and ran off to change into my training gear. I\u2019ve never lived it down. A few weeks later, a letter arrived saying I\u2019d been picked for a week-long camp. I scanned the letter and took it into the kitchen to show to Mum. I began reading it out loud, then I stopped. \u201cOh no,\u201d I said. \u201cMum, they want me to bring my passport. What are we going to do?\u201d Mum frowned. She had applied to make us all British citizens, but the paperwork, the checks, the tests \u2013 it all took a long time. It had never crossed my mind I would need to be naturalised as British to play for England. We had \u201cleave to remain\u201d, which meant we could stay in the country as long as we wanted. I felt entirely British. I\u2019d lived in England my whole life; it was the only home I knew. I was so tired of being the odd one out. I felt a familiar despair rising, one I was coming to associate with my British-Nigerian identity. Passports were a big deal for the Nigerian community in the UK. A red British passport was a prized possession for those who had been in the UK long enough to own one alongside the Nigerian document, known as a green pali. To hold a British passport was a gateway to the world. Mum mentioned our problem to Dad, to her Nigerian friends and family. \u201cListen,\u201d said one uncle, who liked to flaunt that he was a British citizen by birth. \u201cIf she dares show up with green pali, they\u2019ll send that child straight back. She has to be Britico now, don\u2019t you know that?\u201d I felt like an alien in my own country. If I wasn\u2019t British, then what was I? I thought back to my last visit to Nigeria. I felt like a foreigner there, too. Every day I\u2019d wake up and hope the document would drop on to the doormat. Every day it wasn\u2019t there and the camp was another day nearer. In the end, I took an acknowledgement from the Home Office proving Mum had applied for naturalisation, together with a note she wrote. It was all we had. Thankfully, the coaches were more relaxed than expected. A few months later, my passport finally arrived. Mum emptied the burgundy books out on to the table, alongside our Nigerian documents. \u201cNow you can travel wherever you want,\u201d she said. I saw for the first time what this process meant. Getting a red passport was more than a formality. It was about status. She had been an adult when she first came to the UK, and all this time she had been a foreigner. She had worked hard to forge new paths for herself and her children. I turned over the little red book in my hand and stroked the gold coat of arms on the front. I picked out my old Nigerian passport and held it in my other hand. Two passports, two identities. No one could teach me how to navigate this hyphenated identity. For me, being British-Nigerian is a tightrope I\u2019ll be on for the rest of my life. And whenever I wobble, or feel others are trying to pull me in one direction or the other, I grab on to my hyphen and remember I\u2019ll always be both. \u2022 They Don\u2019t Teach This by Eniola Aluko is published by Yellow Jersey Press (\u00a314.99).

It will eradicate the major decisions referees are getting wrong that actually affect games of football. The sooner that comes in the better.\u201d</p> <p>It was after a defeat at Manchester City. Gareth McAuley had been sent off for a professional foul early on. Wilfried Bony was clean through. It was the right decision in every aspect except one. It wasn\u2019t Gareth McAuley. It was Craig Dawson. The referee who made the mistake was Neil Swarbrick.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/21/var-premier-league-sponsor-chief-executive\">Already loving VAR? Wait until the Premier League finds a sponsor for it | Marina Hyde</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI thought they were twin brothers,\u201d Swarbrick jokes. \u201cI sent Gareth off and a few weeks later I saw him and he said not to worry \u2013 he and Craig got mistaken all the time. I asked him why he didn\u2019t complain at the time, and he said it was first minute, they were playing City. He was glad to go off!\u201d</p> <p>The video footage doesn\u2019t quite tally \u2013 McAuley seems to be saying \u201cit wasn\u2019t me\u201d \u2013 but to be fair to Swarbrick it takes Peter Drury and Jim Beglin a good minute in the commentary box to realise McAuley is walking off the pitch. \u201cI would have liked VAR 100%,\u201d Swarbrick says. \u201cIt can only benefit you. There\u2019s nothing worse than driving home from a game knowing you\u2019ve made an error. A key one.\u201d</p> <p>We are at the home of VAR \u2013 Stockley Park. Swarbrick is now VAR Hub Command, which makes it sound as if he should be dressed as a Stormtrooper. Sadly he isn\u2019t. He isn\u2019t even in full referee\u2019s kit. Unlike during the World Cup in Russia, the Premier League VARs wear polo shirts and tracksuit trousers.</p> <p>The room is full of TVs, much like a Bond villain\u2019s lair, but with more life-size posters of Paul Tierney and Craig Pawson. It is wallpapered in referees. Swarbrick runs the whole thing on a matchday \u2013 overseeing all the games. Each one has a VAR, an assistant and a Hawk-Eye operator who presses the buttons.</p> <p>And Swarbrick is happy with VAR\u2019s start to the season. \u201cI think it\u2019s been really positive. It shows that the work we\u2019ve put in over the past two and a half years has been really beneficial. We\u2019re not getting overly involved.

      "bodyText": "\u201cWhat we have to do is find a way to help referees out.\u201d This is Tony Pulis \u2013 then manager of West Brom \u2013 speaking in 2015. \u201cI would definitely call now for managers to have two calls each and every game, where there are 30 seconds and they can have a video link-up with people upstairs who can watch it on video. It will eradicate the major decisions referees are getting wrong that actually affect games of football. The sooner that comes in the better.\u201d It was after a defeat at Manchester City. Gareth McAuley had been sent off for a professional foul early on. Wilfried Bony was clean through. It was the right decision in every aspect except one. It wasn\u2019t Gareth McAuley. It was Craig Dawson. The referee who made the mistake was Neil Swarbrick. \u201cI thought they were twin brothers,\u201d Swarbrick jokes. \u201cI sent Gareth off and a few weeks later I saw him and he said not to worry \u2013 he and Craig got mistaken all the time. I asked him why he didn\u2019t complain at the time, and he said it was first minute, they were playing City. He was glad to go off!\u201d The video footage doesn\u2019t quite tally \u2013 McAuley seems to be saying \u201cit wasn\u2019t me\u201d \u2013 but to be fair to Swarbrick it takes Peter Drury and Jim Beglin a good minute in the commentary box to realise McAuley is walking off the pitch. \u201cI would have liked VAR 100%,\u201d Swarbrick says. \u201cIt can only benefit you. There\u2019s nothing worse than driving home from a game knowing you\u2019ve made an error. A key one.\u201d We are at the home of VAR \u2013 Stockley Park. Swarbrick is now VAR Hub Command, which makes it sound as if he should be dressed as a Stormtrooper. Sadly he isn\u2019t. He isn\u2019t even in full referee\u2019s kit. Unlike during the World Cup in Russia, the Premier League VARs wear polo shirts and tracksuit trousers. The room is full of TVs, much like a Bond villain\u2019s lair, but with more life-size posters of Paul Tierney and Craig Pawson. It is wallpapered in referees. Swarbrick runs the whole thing on a matchday \u2013 overseeing all the games. Each one has a VAR, an assistant and a Hawk-Eye operator who presses the buttons. And Swarbrick is happy with VAR\u2019s start to the season. \u201cI think it\u2019s been really positive. It shows that the work we\u2019ve put in over the past two and a half years has been really beneficial. We\u2019re not getting overly involved. There\u2019s always going to be criticism because there are people who just don\u2019t really like VAR, so it\u2019s our role going forward to try and convert them and show that we\u2019re not trying to interrupt the game.\u201d The Premier League and Professional Game Match Officials Limited have put on sessions for reporters and journalists to help explain how VAR will be used.

      "body": "<p>I was late getting to this week\u2019s selected film \u2013 though not as late as film distributors in the UK: it has never been picked up for a cinema or even a DVD release. For more than two years, respected colleagues have been talking up the merits of <strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ML2gfnrwXcs\" title=\"\">Araby</a></strong>, a tiny but mighty fiction debut by Brazilian film-makers Jo\u00e3o Dumans and Affonso Uchoa. The <em>Hollywood Reporter</em> critic Neil Young has gone so far as to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BohemiaStable/status/1106940215342628864\" title=\"\">declare it</a> the best film of this fast-closing decade. Having missed it on its year-long festival run in 2017, I waited for a chance to see it on a big screen.</p> <p>That chance hasn\u2019t come, but Mubi has, as it so often does, stepped into the breach. <em>Araby</em> is <a href=\"https://mubi.com/showing/araby\">available to stream</a> on their curated menu until mid-September; you\u2019d do well to take the chance while it\u2019s there. The film is, as promised, something very special: a careworn, will-o\u2019-the-wisp road movie, contained within a memory that may or may not be imagined. Dumans and Uchoa have a documentary background that\u2019s evident in their calm, clear-eyed portrait of a hard-knock life in permanent flux. Yet there\u2019s a glimmering, uncertain magic to it too. It\u2019s a film preoccupied with the way we fashion our lives into storytelling.</p> <p>You have to approach it with some patience. The first 20 minutes or so promise a more austere exercise in grainy realism than the poetic picaresque we eventually get, but the tonal contrast eventually pays off as the film considers the virtues of restless movement versus stasis. We\u2019re introduced to Andre (Murilo Caliari), a shy, bored teenager abandoned by his parents in a dead-end Brazilian factory town, and Cristiano (Aristides de Sousa), the diminutive itinerant labourer whose path he crosses. Sent on an errand to Cristiano\u2019s quarters, Andre stumbles across his tatty, handwritten memoirs \u2013 and the film in turn shifts into the notebook\u2019s more mythic, freewheeling narrative, documenting the seemingly unremarkable worker\u2019s travels and travails over the course of a decade.</p> <p>It\u2019s a cross-country, blue-collar odyssey taking in criminal and romantic escapades, stopping off in prisons, brothels and assorted dusty towns \u2013 building into a patchwork of struggling, ever-changing Brazilian society, alive with pointed working-class politics. Cristiano is a drifter, but not driven by wanderlust: it\u2019s hard-scrabble economic reality that blows him from place to place. Scored to a gorgeous, handpicked playlist of folk and country cuts that lend unsentimental grace to our hero\u2019s ramblings, <em>Araby</em> has the heft and expanse of epic film-making, yet feels as intimate and fragile as a stranger\u2019s barroom anecdote.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ML2gfnrwXcs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ML2gfnrwXcs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ML2gfnrwXcs\">Watch a trailer for Araby.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>While you\u2019re in a wistful arthouse reverie, you have a week left to catch some highlights from the recent Locarno film festival, which wrapped last week.

      "body": "<p>When Anna Burns, author of last year\u2019s Booker prize-winning account of the Troubles, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/31/milkman-anna-burns-review-northern-ireland\" title=\"\">Milkman</a></em>, was asked whether writing was a political act, she was taken aback. \u201cHonestly? This is the sort of question I don\u2019t know what to do with. It\u2019s not how my brain works.\u201d Eventually she allowed that if politics was about power then yes, OK, her work was political. Such qualms did not deter the judges of the inaugural Orwell prize for political fiction from awarding Burns another trophy. Chair of judges Tom Sutcliffe praised <em>Milkman</em>\u2019s \u201caccount of how political allegiances crush and deform our instinctive human loyalties\u201d.</p> <p>Like the rest of the Orwell prize shortlist, <em>Milkman</em><strong> </strong>has a theme rather than an agenda. Always capacious, the genre of political fiction can now accommodate authors such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/alismith\" title=\"\">Ali Smith</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/rachel-kushner\" title=\"\">Rachel Kushner</a>, Paul Beatty and Jonathan Coe. As George Orwell wrote: \u201cNo book is genuinely free from political bias.

Take, for example, <em>Looking Backward: 2000-1887</em> (1888). Wrapping his prospectus for American socialism inside the tale of a Bostonian aristocrat who sleeps for 113 years and awakes in an egalitarian utopia, the journalist Edward Bellamy produced a colossal bestseller that was said to have introduced more Americans to socialism than Karl Marx. <em>Looking Backward</em>\u2019s influence extended to suffragists, populists, HG Wells, Morris, Franklin D Roosevelt and Clement Attlee, who told Bellamy\u2019s son Paul that the postwar Labour government was \u201ca child of the Bellamy ideal\u201d.

Beecher Stowe\u2019s <em>Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin</em> fired up the abolitionist movement. <em>The Ragged-Trousered Philanthropists</em> (1914), Robert Tressell\u2019s autobiographical account of poverty and exploitation in small-town England, has, as Labour MP Dan Carden said recently, \u201cgiven the socialist movement of our time a story to get behind\u201d.</p> <p>At the other end of the political spectrum, Rand\u2019s hectoring libertarian parables <em>The Fountainhead</em> (1943) and <em>Atlas Shrugged</em> have shaped the thinking of powerful disciples including the former House speaker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/paul-ryan\" title=\"\">Paul Ryan</a>, US supreme court justice <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/clarence-thomas\" title=\"\">Clarence Thomas</a>, the economist Alan Greenspan and chancellor of the exchequer Sajid Javid.

Many of the most politically effective prewar novelists were socialists, whose moral prestige was destabilised by Stalinism. Stalin\u2019s insistence on socialist realism made polemic both aesthetically and morally suspect. \u201cBluntness was done for by communism because communism told you that you had to write novels that had messages,\u201d Seaton says. \u201cAnd we were all on the side of Vasily Grossman, who didn\u2019t write messages. Bluntness looks ideological.\u201d</p> <p>Any novelist who does still want to stimulate political reform, the critics be damned, has to reckon with a political class that takes far less interest in literary fiction than the generation of Attlee and Bevan. Seaton recalls spending time with Labour cabinet minister Roy Jenkins during the 1960s: \u201cHe took ideas in and metabolised them. There is something about the lives that senior politicians and administrators have now that doesn\u2019t reward hinterland and doesn\u2019t give them time to reflect.\u201d A vicious circle takes effect, in which politicians lose interest in political fiction and authors lose faith in their potential to influence politics.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin, Looking Backward, The Grapes of Wrath: all runaway bestsellers that demanded a response from politicians</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One notable exception is Labour party deputy leader Tom Watson, whose touchstones include <em>Looking Backward</em> and Arthur Koestler\u2019s eye-opening account of Stalinist persecution, <em>Darkness at Noon</em> (1940). \u201cThe best politicians capture the imagination, as do all great novels,\u201d Watson says. \u201cThey can touch the emotional self as well as the rational self. They can stimulate internal thinking. <em>Darkness at Noon</em> gave me a real insight into how ideology can be used to oppress.\u201d</p> <p>The average politician wouldn\u2019t be wrong, however, to assume that political fiction lacks traction with voters and therefore a pressing claim on their attention. No recent book comes close to the reach of <em>Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin</em>, <em>Looking Backward</em> or John Steinbeck\u2019s dustbowl tragedy <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/15/robert-mcrum-100-best-novels-observer-steinbeck-grapes-wrath\" title=\"\">The Grapes of Wrath</a></em> (1939): all runaway bestsellers that demanded some kind of response from politicians. This reflects the novel\u2019s broader loss of cultural primacy. A century ago, it was still the dominant form of storytelling so any writer with a political message to disseminate was inclined to give it a shot. Campaigning writers believed that a veneer of fiction, however thin, was deemed necessary to sugarcoat the message. After the second world war, however, the evolution of the \u201cnon-fiction novel\u201d removed the need for journalists to masquerade as novelists. A 21st-century Sinclair might well decide to frame a book like <em>The Jungle</em> as straightforward reportage, while a modern <em>Looking Backward</em> would probably be a manifesto in the style of Paul Mason\u2019s <em>PostCapitalism</em> (2015). The popularity of mass-market non-fiction has relieved the old commercial pressure to crunch a political argument into an artificial format. John Lanchester, for example, alternates between fiction and non-fiction according to what he wants to say.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"623a22f43c8e135238f4408f091607f15208425e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/623a22f43c8e135238f4408f091607f15208425e/15_403_2217_1329/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A novel for television \u2026 The Wire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A novel for television\u2019 \u2026 The Wire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Why even stick to the printed page? Its creator David Simon called <em>The Wire</em> \u201ca novel for television\u201d and critics responded by saying that it did for Baltimore what Dickens did for Victorian London. Like Sinclair, Simon made his bones as a campaigning journalist and brought a certain didacticism to <em>The Wire</em>. \u201cWe were the editorial board,\u201d he said of the writers\u2019 room. \u201cAnd we were making our arguments as best we could, utilising narrative drama.\u201d It\u2019s hard to think of a modern novel with the moral zeal and political impact of Ken Loach\u2019s films <em>Cathy Come Home </em>(1966) or <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/12/i-daniel-blake-ken-loachs-welfare-state-polemic-is-blunt-dignified-and-brutally-moving\" title=\"\">I, Daniel Blake</a></em> (2016): this year\u2019s Orwell prize for best article went to an essay called \u201cAdministrative Justice in the Wake of <em>I, Daniel Blake</em>\u201d. Perhaps it is fine if Simon is our Dickens and Loach our Tressell. \u201cThere\u2019s no absolute necessity for novels to enjoy a position of privilege in the culture,\u201d says Leith. \u201cIn terms of how ideas get disseminated, whatever medium is reaching people is the important one.\u201d</p> <p>Even now, there are still a few novelists who set out to grab the reader by the lapels. Seaton commends Dave Eggers\u2019 urgent Silicon Valley satire <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/09/circle-dave-eggers-review\" title=\"\">The Circle</a></em> (2013) for crystallising concerns about social media in the form of a thriller and causing ripples in the worlds of tech and politics. Frank Cottrell-Boyce, the children\u2019s author and screenwriter, says that YA fiction, with its naturally curious and idealistic readership, is an underrated vehicle for political ideas and compares the well-travelled novelist Elizabeth Laird to \u201ca particularly passionate and empathetic foreign correspondent, reporting back from the wider world\u201d. But he\u2019s concerned that, since the success of Suzanne Collins\u2019s <em>The Hunger Games</em> (2008), dark futures have eclipsed bright ones.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9ece339aa2f88b91229bc6cd68dce6e27b47c180\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ece339aa2f88b91229bc6cd68dce6e27b47c180/0_0_2717_1630/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Moral zeal \u2026 Ken Loach\u2019s 2016 film I, Daniel Blake.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Moral zeal \u2026 Ken Loach\u2019s 2016 film I, Daniel Blake.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI worry that the flood of dystopian fiction has changed the definition of normal \u2013 that it has acclimatised younger readers to an atmosphere of corruption and lying,\u201d he says. \u201cI do believe that one important duty which fiction seems not to be fulfilling is painting a picture of what good looks like. I guess to be truly political a work of art should be offering at least the possibility of change and a way forward.\u201d</p> <p>All literary traditions have peaks and troughs but the campaigning novel seems to have been sunk from all sides, more often than not regarded with apathy or scepticism by writers, readers, critics and politicians alike. Coe feels that politically motivated authors will continue to be forced to find more circuitous routes to the reader\u2019s sympathies, even when they would rather cut to the heart of the matter.</p> <p>\u201cTwo of my most overtly political novels, <em>What a Carve Up!</em> and <em>Number 11</em>, are both quite tricksy in their approach,\u201d he says, \u201calmost as if you have to apologise for the political content by wrapping it up in something irrefutably \u2018literary\u2019.\u201d Ken Loach read <em>Number 11</em>,<em> </em>Coe says<em>,</em> and \u201cwrote me a very kind letter in which he remarked that all of the review quotes on the paperback seemed to be praising the literary aspects of the book and made little mention of the fact that it was a novel with a strong anti-austerity message. It was a comment that resonated with me, and made me suspect that in this country the best a novel can hope for is to be praised in spite of its politics, not because of them.\u201d </p> <p><em>\u2022 Dorian Lynskey\u2019s The Ministry of Truth: A Biography of George Orwell\u2019s 1984 is published by Picador.</em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 3 September 2019 to correct an editing error that led to the suggestion that it was Franklin D Roosevelt, rather than Theodore, who established the forerunner of the US Food and Drug Administration.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When Anna Burns, author of last year\u2019s Booker prize-winning account of the Troubles, Milkman, was asked whether writing was a political act, she was taken aback. \u201cHonestly? This is the sort of question I don\u2019t know what to do with. It\u2019s not how my brain works.\u201d Eventually she allowed that if politics was about power then yes, OK, her work was political. Such qualms did not deter the judges of the inaugural Orwell prize for political fiction from awarding Burns another trophy. Chair of judges Tom Sutcliffe praised Milkman\u2019s \u201caccount of how political allegiances crush and deform our instinctive human loyalties\u201d. Like the rest of the Orwell prize shortlist, Milkman has a theme rather than an agenda. Always capacious, the genre of political fiction can now accommodate authors such as Ali Smith, Rachel Kushner, Paul Beatty and Jonathan Coe. As George Orwell wrote: \u201cNo book is genuinely free from political bias. The opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude.\u201d Much harder to find, however, is an example of what one might call the campaigning novel: that subset that includes classics by the likes of Charles Dickens and \u00c9mile Zola alongside fiction-cloaked manifestos, memoirs and works of reportage. What unites them is a passionate desire to use character and narrative to draw the reader\u2019s attention to some social ill and to galvanise efforts to remedy it. As Sam Leith, Orwell prize judge, describes the approach: \u201cLook at this, isn\u2019t it awful?\u201d When he announced the longlist in May, Sutcliffe said that it \u201cacknowledges that the politics in a book can often be found between the lines, rather than on them\u201d. Coe, whose state-of-the-nation novel Middle England did not make the longlist, took this as an \u201cimplicit rebuke\u201d to books with an explicit agenda. \u201cMy response would be that sometimes there is a time to speak loud and clear,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd anyway, as my character Doug Anderton says in The Rotters\u2019 Club: \u2018Subtlety is the English disease.\u2019 I think it\u2019s a peculiarly English thing, this recoiling from a novel whose political message seems too overt. In France, for example, writers can receive extra points for being engag\u00e9s. Even in Scotland, the likes of James Kelman and Alasdair Gray are considered national heroes partly for the political content of their work. But in England that seems to be considered rather vulgar.\u201d Manifestly political novels have always aroused some degree of suspicion. Orwell famously categorised Harriet Beecher Stowe\u2019s anti-slavery novel Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin (1852) as a \u201cgood bad book\u201d \u2013 crude yet effective \u2013 and Milan Kundera in turn dismissed Orwell\u2019s Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949) as \u201cpolitical thought disguised as a novel\u201d. In a devastating review, Whittaker Chambers said that Ayn Rand\u2019s colossal philosophical tract Atlas Shrugged (1957) \u201ccan be called a novel only by devaluing the term \u2026 Its story merely serves Miss Rand to get the customers inside the tent, and as a soapbox for delivering her Message.\u201d Resistance to a message has only grown stronger since then. Leith believes the tides of literary fashion have left the campaigning novel high and dry. \u201cWe\u2019ve all drunk in the idea that you don\u2019t reward a book for its subject matter but its literary craft,\u201d he says. \u201cWhile the consistency of the metaphors is fair game, the value of their ideas is less so.\u201d This critical focus on form and language rewards a book as unusual as Milkman but creates a frosty climate for any author with a blatant reformist agenda. \u201cWhen you study literature, you learn the mantra that great art is not political,\u201d agrees Joanna Kavenna, whose latest novel Zed is a wry satire about the unravelling of a supranational tech giant. \u201cYou read that ideas are somehow an imposition on fiction. But as soon as you create a character or write a story, you\u2019re into an idea about society whether you like it or not.\u201d Influenced by Kafka, Gogol and the \u201ctradition of unease\u201d, Kavenna prefers to deploy irony to express the strangeness of modern life. More didactic fiction, she says, is prone to being dismissed as propaganda. \u201cWriters like [William] Morris could be very certain: this is my political programme, I want these outcomes. They were so sure of themselves and where they were in society. Our world is much more volatile and the audiences are much more sophisticated.

The Jungle (1906), Upton Sinclair\u2019s stomach-churning expos\u00e9 of the plight of immigrant labourers in the Chicago meatpacking industry, prompted President Theodore Roosevelt to establish the forerunner of the Food and Drug Administration, though not (to Sinclair\u2019s disappointment) to improve workers\u2019 rights. The Citadel (1937), AJ Cronin\u2019s bestseller about a morally compromised doctor in a Welsh mining town, influenced his friend Aneurin Bevan\u2019s plans for the NHS. Beecher Stowe\u2019s Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin fired up the abolitionist movement. The Ragged-Trousered Philanthropists (1914), Robert Tressell\u2019s autobiographical account of poverty and exploitation in small-town England, has, as Labour MP Dan Carden said recently, \u201cgiven the socialist movement of our time a story to get behind\u201d. At the other end of the political spectrum, Rand\u2019s hectoring libertarian parables The Fountainhead (1943) and Atlas Shrugged have shaped the thinking of powerful disciples including the former House speaker Paul Ryan, US supreme court justice Clarence Thomas, the economist Alan Greenspan and chancellor of the exchequer Sajid Javid. Chinua Achebe\u2019s anti-colonialist milestone Things Fall Apart (1958), a favourite of Jeremy Corbyn and Barack Obama, and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn\u2019s gulag chronicle One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich (1962) alerted an international readership to gross injustices in Nigeria and the Soviet Union respectively. These are just some examples that made a significant dent in the political landscape; many more novelists thought it worth trying. But the campaigning novel has become an anachronism.

John Lanchester, for example, alternates between fiction and non-fiction according to what he wants to say. Why even stick to the printed page? Its creator David Simon called The Wire \u201ca novel for television\u201d and critics responded by saying that it did for Baltimore what Dickens did for Victorian London. Like Sinclair, Simon made his bones as a campaigning journalist and brought a certain didacticism to The Wire. \u201cWe were the editorial board,\u201d he said of the writers\u2019 room. \u201cAnd we were making our arguments as best we could, utilising narrative drama.\u201d It\u2019s hard to think of a modern novel with the moral zeal and political impact of Ken Loach\u2019s films Cathy Come Home (1966) or I, Daniel Blake (2016): this year\u2019s Orwell prize for best article went to an essay called \u201cAdministrative Justice in the Wake of I, Daniel Blake\u201d. Perhaps it is fine if Simon is our Dickens and Loach our Tressell. \u201cThere\u2019s no absolute necessity for novels to enjoy a position of privilege in the culture,\u201d says Leith. \u201cIn terms of how ideas get disseminated, whatever medium is reaching people is the important one.\u201d Even now, there are still a few novelists who set out to grab the reader by the lapels. Seaton commends Dave Eggers\u2019 urgent Silicon Valley satire The Circle (2013) for crystallising concerns about social media in the form of a thriller and causing ripples in the worlds of tech and politics. Frank Cottrell-Boyce, the children\u2019s author and screenwriter, says that YA fiction, with its naturally curious and idealistic readership, is an underrated vehicle for political ideas and compares the well-travelled novelist Elizabeth Laird to \u201ca particularly passionate and empathetic foreign correspondent, reporting back from the wider world\u201d. But he\u2019s concerned that, since the success of Suzanne Collins\u2019s The Hunger Games (2008), dark futures have eclipsed bright ones. \u201cI worry that the flood of dystopian fiction has changed the definition of normal \u2013 that it has acclimatised younger readers to an atmosphere of corruption and lying,\u201d he says. \u201cI do believe that one important duty which fiction seems not to be fulfilling is painting a picture of what good looks like. I guess to be truly political a work of art should be offering at least the possibility of change and a way forward.\u201d All literary traditions have peaks and troughs but the campaigning novel seems to have been sunk from all sides, more often than not regarded with apathy or scepticism by writers, readers, critics and politicians alike. Coe feels that politically motivated authors will continue to be forced to find more circuitous routes to the reader\u2019s sympathies, even when they would rather cut to the heart of the matter. \u201cTwo of my most overtly political novels, What a Carve Up! and Number 11, are both quite tricksy in their approach,\u201d he says, \u201calmost as if you have to apologise for the political content by wrapping it up in something irrefutably \u2018literary\u2019.\u201d Ken Loach read Number 11, Coe says, and \u201cwrote me a very kind letter in which he remarked that all of the review quotes on the paperback seemed to be praising the literary aspects of the book and made little mention of the fact that it was a novel with a strong anti-austerity message. It was a comment that resonated with me, and made me suspect that in this country the best a novel can hope for is to be praised in spite of its politics, not because of them.\u201d \u2022 Dorian Lynskey\u2019s The Ministry of Truth: A Biography of George Orwell\u2019s 1984 is published by Picador. \u2022 This article was amended on 3 September 2019 to correct an editing error that led to the suggestion that it was Franklin D Roosevelt, rather than Theodore, who established the forerunner of the US Food and Drug Administration.",

She was 19, and she had incurred her parents\u2019 disapproval by starting a degree in philosophy. In love with her cousin, she still half hoped for a conventional marriage, but felt disturbed that she could only have \u201cone life\u201d. She wanted to fill it with as many different experiences as possible, already sure that her vocation as a philosopher compelled her to live differently, using herself as the raw material for her ideas. Two years later she recorded \u201ccurious certainty that this reserve of riches that I feel within me will make its mark \u2026 that this life of mine will be a well-spring from which others will drink\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/20/was-simone-de-beauvoir-as-feminist-as-we-thought\">Was Simone de Beauvoir as feminist as we thought?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There has been a succession of biographies of De Beauvoir since Deirdre Bair\u2019s authorised and therefore somewhat inaccurate life appeared in 1990, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lisaappignanesi\" title=\"\">Lisa Appignanesi</a>\u2019s slim, trenchant account to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jan/12/society.simonedebeauvoir\" title=\"\">Toril Moi</a>\u2019s more theoretically driven <em>The Making of an Intellectual Woman</em> to Carole Seymour-Jones\u2019s moving portrait of De Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre as a couple and Claudine Monteil\u2019s portrait (not translated into English) of De Beauvoir the activist. In writing the life again, the philosopher Kate Kirkpatrick hopes to bring new material into the public domain (De Beauvoir\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/22/simone-de-beauvoirs-mad-passion-for-young-lover-revealed-in-letters\" title=\"\">letters </a>to her final serious lover, Claude Lanzmann, were only made available in 2018) and to offer new interpretations for our age. \u201cBiography can reveal what a society cares about, what it values,\u201d Kirkpatrick writes, so \u201cby encountering the values of another person in another time we can learn more about our own.\u201d</p> <p>This is certainly true, and I\u2019d have liked to learn more about what De Beauvoir has to tell us today than we are given here. Her complex, ambivalent ideas about gender as both inherent and performed can be usefully brought to bear on the current dilemmas about transsexuality. We can\u2019t ventriloquise De Beauvoir in the present, but it would be worth dwelling with these ideas for longer than Kirkpatrick does. She gives more space to De Beauvoir\u2019s contrary relationship with feminism, and the discussion here is helpfully rich. De Beauvoir, like her almost contemporary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/dorislessing\" title=\"\">Doris Lessing</a>, was initially reluctant to lend her support to the women\u2019s liberation movement, despite being co-opted as a heroine. In her 1963 autobiography, she congratulated herself on avoiding \u201cfalling into the trap of feminism\u201d in <em>The Second Sex</em>. However, Kirkpatrick shows her outing herself as a feminist in the 1970s, calling for \u201cthe abolition of the family\u201d and deciding that economic independence and socialism would not in fact deliver the changes needed to emancipate women. She campaigned bravely for the right to abortion in terms that could inform the debates today.</p> <p>I think that as well as seeing De Beauvoir as a proto-feminist, we can see her as a pioneer behind the current feminist strand of the project known as autofiction or autotheory. In using their lives as material for their art, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/30/chris-kraus-ive-never-had-much-talent-for-making-things-up-i-love-dick-interview\" title=\"\">Chris Kraus</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/may/21/argonauts-maggie-nelson-the-red-parts-interview-rachel-cooke\" title=\"\">Maggie Nelson</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/rachel-cusk\" title=\"\">Rachel Cusk</a> are writing in a tradition begun by her. In <em>The Second Sex</em> in particular, she pioneered the practice of writing novelistic scenes about her own experience and then analysing them. Throughout De Beauvoir\u2019s life we see both the costs and gains of life undertaken as a philosophical experiment. She chose to exercise her philosophical commitment to freedom, while understanding from the 1940s that her freedom should not come at the expense of others\u2019. She made mistakes \u2013 the damage done to the young women she and Sartre shared between them is well known \u2013 and paid the price of jealousy and remorse. But these helped her refine her ideas about freedom and bad faith, enabling her to develop an ethics of existentialism, which Kirkpatrick convincingly shows was her great contribution to the philosophical project she shared with Sartre.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>De Beauvoir and Lanzmann lived together for seven years, he was the only lover she ever addressed with the familiar 'tu'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Having experimented in life, De Beauvoir also experimented with literary form, finding new ways to write her autobiography and her philosophy simultaneously. Each of her novels, memoirs and works of philosophy was a new venture in this. During her lifetime, there was a lot of debate over whether she was a philosopher or a novelist. The press tended to label Sartre the existentialist philosopher and De Beauvoir the mere \u201cNotre Dame de Sartreuse\u201d, a novelist engaged in giving life to his ideas. De Beauvoir saw this as false: she was a philosopher whose commitment to particularity (\u201csituations are different, and therefore so are freedoms\u201d) entailed the use of forms that could render experience universal without generalising.

      "bodyText": "\u201cDon\u2019t be \u2018Mlle Beauvoir\u2019. Be me,\u201d Simone de Beauvoir wrote in her diary in 1927. She was 19, and she had incurred her parents\u2019 disapproval by starting a degree in philosophy. In love with her cousin, she still half hoped for a conventional marriage, but felt disturbed that she could only have \u201cone life\u201d. She wanted to fill it with as many different experiences as possible, already sure that her vocation as a philosopher compelled her to live differently, using herself as the raw material for her ideas. Two years later she recorded \u201ccurious certainty that this reserve of riches that I feel within me will make its mark \u2026 that this life of mine will be a well-spring from which others will drink\u201d. There has been a succession of biographies of De Beauvoir since Deirdre Bair\u2019s authorised and therefore somewhat inaccurate life appeared in 1990, from Lisa Appignanesi\u2019s slim, trenchant account to Toril Moi\u2019s more theoretically driven The Making of an Intellectual Woman to Carole Seymour-Jones\u2019s moving portrait of De Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre as a couple and Claudine Monteil\u2019s portrait (not translated into English) of De Beauvoir the activist. In writing the life again, the philosopher Kate Kirkpatrick hopes to bring new material into the public domain (De Beauvoir\u2019s letters to her final serious lover, Claude Lanzmann, were only made available in 2018) and to offer new interpretations for our age. \u201cBiography can reveal what a society cares about, what it values,\u201d Kirkpatrick writes, so \u201cby encountering the values of another person in another time we can learn more about our own.\u201d This is certainly true, and I\u2019d have liked to learn more about what De Beauvoir has to tell us today than we are given here. Her complex, ambivalent ideas about gender as both inherent and performed can be usefully brought to bear on the current dilemmas about transsexuality. We can\u2019t ventriloquise De Beauvoir in the present, but it would be worth dwelling with these ideas for longer than Kirkpatrick does. She gives more space to De Beauvoir\u2019s contrary relationship with feminism, and the discussion here is helpfully rich. De Beauvoir, like her almost contemporary Doris Lessing, was initially reluctant to lend her support to the women\u2019s liberation movement, despite being co-opted as a heroine. In her 1963 autobiography, she congratulated herself on avoiding \u201cfalling into the trap of feminism\u201d in The Second Sex. However, Kirkpatrick shows her outing herself as a feminist in the 1970s, calling for \u201cthe abolition of the family\u201d and deciding that economic independence and socialism would not in fact deliver the changes needed to emancipate women. She campaigned bravely for the right to abortion in terms that could inform the debates today. I think that as well as seeing De Beauvoir as a proto-feminist, we can see her as a pioneer behind the current feminist strand of the project known as autofiction or autotheory. In using their lives as material for their art, Chris Kraus, Maggie Nelson and Rachel Cusk are writing in a tradition begun by her. In The Second Sex in particular, she pioneered the practice of writing novelistic scenes about her own experience and then analysing them. Throughout De Beauvoir\u2019s life we see both the costs and gains of life undertaken as a philosophical experiment. She chose to exercise her philosophical commitment to freedom, while understanding from the 1940s that her freedom should not come at the expense of others\u2019. She made mistakes \u2013 the damage done to the young women she and Sartre shared between them is well known \u2013 and paid the price of jealousy and remorse. But these helped her refine her ideas about freedom and bad faith, enabling her to develop an ethics of existentialism, which Kirkpatrick convincingly shows was her great contribution to the philosophical project she shared with Sartre. Having experimented in life, De Beauvoir also experimented with literary form, finding new ways to write her autobiography and her philosophy simultaneously. Each of her novels, memoirs and works of philosophy was a new venture in this. During her lifetime, there was a lot of debate over whether she was a philosopher or a novelist. The press tended to label Sartre the existentialist philosopher and De Beauvoir the mere \u201cNotre Dame de Sartreuse\u201d, a novelist engaged in giving life to his ideas. De Beauvoir saw this as false: she was a philosopher whose commitment to particularity (\u201csituations are different, and therefore so are freedoms\u201d) entailed the use of forms that could render experience universal without generalising. So in her life and her work she was courageously committed throughout to the process of becoming, which Kirkpatrick profitably makes her central theme. There isn\u2019t much material here that\u2019s unknown to scholars, but the letters to Lanzmann do constitute a major new resource. When they met in 1952, Lanzmann was 26, De Beauvoir 44. She had recently emerged from a relationship with the American novelist Nelson Algren, which she felt had remade her as a sexual woman, leading to many of the revelations about the possibilities of genuinely mutual sexual transformation she elucidated in The Second Sex. Algren, however, had left her feeling depleted and old, worried that her sexual life was over. Lanzmann convinced her that it wasn\u2019t, and became a new collaborator, reading her work and learning from her in his (he went on to direct the landmark Holocaust film Shoah, under her influence). They lived together for seven years and he was the only lover she ever addressed with the familiar tu. Kirkpatrick could make more of her letters to him, using them to give a sense of the scenography of her days. It\u2019s probably sensible to avoid descriptions of apricot cocktails in Left Bank cafes, but with a philosopher so committed to using daily life as raw material, it would be good to hear more about her experiences of domestic life and about her impressions of the places she spent time in. Where Kirkpatrick\u2019s biography is strongest is in clarifying and showing the strength of De Beauvoir\u2019s ethical commitments, and how these were transformed into political commitments after the war. Her concern for the situation in Algeria in the 1950s and 60s is movingly recorded, as is her tireless commitment to helping younger women.

You might have a debut album out that week, but gastroenteritis doesn\u2019t care about promo. \u201cIt started last week. I\u2019ve been travelling loads \u2013 America, Europe, Asia, back to America. I was doing a shoot when I started to feel tired and nauseous and weird,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/may/03/one-to-watch-mabel-r-and-b-singer-bedroom-ep-neneh-cherry\">Mabel Alabama Pearl McVey</a>. A few hours later, she\u2019s throwing up side of stage before being whisked off to hospital where they initially diagnose appendicitis because she\u2019s in so much pain.</p> <p>While most of us would be under the duvet watching Cash in the Attic, for this 23-year-old there\u2019s no such thing as a sick day. When I meet her at a central London restaurant after her live session at Radio 1, she is sprightly, noting her Live Lounge was \u201cpossibly my best yet\u201d. She had to cancel in-stores and signings, but she\u2019s still doing some promo (such as this interview), plus, bizarrely, appearing at the British Grand Prix, where she does a lap in a car and presents a pole award at the qualifying round \u2013 because her debut album just came out and she wants it to hit the top spot.</p> <p>It\u2019s called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/aug/03/mabel-high-expectations-album-review\">High Expectations</a>, a fitting title considering the reason Mabel got ill in the first place is the pressure she puts herself under. \u201cI\u2019m feeling better, but it\u2019s mainly when I get worked up, so I\u2019m trying not to stress \u2019cause it makes the acid in my stomach go mad. It\u2019s difficult because I care so much about what I do, so I say yes to everything because I want to be as big as I can be. But I\u2019ve realised that trying to be superwoman means at some point you\u2019ll hit a wall and not be able to do anything. Sometimes you have to sleep.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RolCizAF8RI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RolCizAF8RI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Unfortunately, the album was kept off the top spot by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/12/ed-sheeran-no-6-collaborations-project-review\">Ed Sheeran</a> and Lewis Capaldi, leaving Mabel with a No 3. \u201cI\u2019m so gutted. Well, I\u2019m not gutted. Obviously it\u2019s sick, but I really wanted a No 1. It\u2019s alright,\u201d she decides with a pretend pout, \u201cwe\u2019ll go again next time.\u201d</p> <p>Mabel officially began her musical life on SoundCloud in 2015 making dreamy R&amp;B songs such as Know Me Better and Thinking of You. She\u2019d feature in fashion magazines and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/dec/06/best-albums-of-2016-no-9-konnichiwa-by-skepta\">Skepta</a> videos, all slicked back hair, gold hoops and khaki bombers. But over time she dropped cool in favour of commercial; now it\u2019s thigh-high boots, selfies, Afrobeats and tropical house. In the beginning she was \u201cthis \u2018urban, west-London, making-90s-R&amp;B-over-a-breakbeat\u2019 artist,\u201d she says, \u201cand, yeah, I enjoyed that, it\u2019s a big part of who I am. But so is Afrobeat. I\u2019m multicultural, I\u2019ve got all these different sides and I want to showcase all of them.\u201d It\u2019s working; she\u2019s so far clocked up over one billion streams with both her own tunes and collaborations with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJTtiYMdMtk\">Not3s</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXanlLjOFh0\">Jax Jones</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_xsgfOWpY4\">Stefflon Don</a>, with YouTube views at well over 300 million. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make music that you have to have a fucking degree to listen to,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to make music that a 14-year-old girl in Cardiff will love and relate to. I want to make pop music and tour the world and stand in big arenas. I want to make people feel good, I want to make them feel confident. I want to appeal to as many people as possible.\u201d</p> <p>Besides, it made her miserable, trying to be cool. \u201cI spent hours torturing myself thinking I should dress more like this, sing more like that. I missed a whole year of my life because I wasn\u2019t being myself and my career stalled. My mum\u2019s a fucking excellent example. The reason she was so successful was that she did not give a shit about what people thought.\u201d Mabel is the daughter of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/feb/23/neneh-cherry-blank-project-solo-album-interview\">Neneh \u2018pregnant-on-TOTP-and-what\u2019 Cherry</a> and Massive Attack producer Cameron McVey. She was born in M\u00e1laga, Spain and brought up in west London. The family later moved to Stockholm when Mabel was eight, before returning to London five years ago. She bought her own place \u2013 a two-bed new build which she keeps very clean, apart from piles of shoes and bags stacked on various surfaces. Her shelves are lined with self-help books: How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck, as well as Lily Allen and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/26/michelle-obama-memoir-sells-more-than-10m-copies\">Michelle Obama\u2019s autobiographies</a>. In the centre of the living room, there\u2019s a beautiful piano, above which is a framed poster by her godfather, the visionary stylist Judy Blame, who died in February 2018. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7a0ac29ec832557b81dbe3f9a41c2db1a3cb3d4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a0ac29ec832557b81dbe3f9a41c2db1a3cb3d4b/0_0_2095_3000/698.jpg\" alt=\"Neneh Cherry (L) and daughter Mabel in 2014\" width=\"698\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Neneh Cherry and Mabel in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David M Benett/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIs it OK that I have my plaques up?\u201d she wonders, semi-rhetorically, nodding towards the discs that mark sales of chart success such as My Lover, Fine Line and Finders Keepers. </p> <p>While her manager, Radha Medar, encouraged Mabel to seek out some vulnerability for her album \u2013 a tone that\u2019s allowed deeper lyrical themes such as on OK (Anxiety Anthem) and Stockhlm Syndrome \u2013 it was her sassiest single, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TQKyDD9Yig\">Don\u2019t Call Me Up</a>, that provided her with her biggest and best hit so far. With its unusual structure, the song proved she could be both kooky and commercial, and found her a new audience in America. She was so scared about performing on Jimmy Fallon she made her mum and dad come with her. \u201cThey\u2019re good for nerves. And I had a little cry, that\u2019s good for nerves too. I cry about all the bad things that could happen, and then they won\u2019t happen.\u201d Like what? \u201cFalling on my face, singing the wrong words, you know, just generally being a twat.\u201d</p> <p>Mabel is really good company, which is a lovely surprise because it\u2019s hard to get a sense of her personality from her socials and live shows. She appears slick and shiny, so you can\u2019t tell that she\u2019s funny, smart and thoughtful. At one point she mentions writing a track about lazy lovers. \u201cI\u2019ve been shocked at how many guys won\u2019t lift a motherfucking finger and expect you to do all the fucking work. I\u2019m here doing backflips and the fucking splits,\u201d she splutters.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing bro? Let\u2019s get moving!\u201d Such casual candour just doesn\u2019t match up to Mabel\u2019s much more polished pop star persona and she agrees there\u2019s a disparity somewhere. \u201cThere is so much more to me, I think I\u2019ve just been so focused on the music. I do want people to know me better,\u201d she adds. </p> <p>She\u2019s also passionately outspoken about many issues, including Grenfell. She was raised around the corner and headed straight there that terrible first morning, on 14 June 2017, with her family.</p> <p>\u201cWe donated as much as possible, cleaned, organised shit. My parents were driving food to people in hotels, families of five forced to live up on the 12th floor. So fucking traumatising. And people still don\u2019t have housing. It\u2019s disgusting. Just because it\u2019s not in the news every day, you have to remember that people just like you lost their kids, their husbands, their wives. It\u2019s gonna hurt for the rest of their lives. We have to do more. I won\u2019t forget. We can\u2019t forget.\u201d</p> <p>Mabel has always been empathetic, perhaps to a fault, although her mum reckons her sensitivity is her superpower. \u201cI\u2019ve had anxiety my whole life, I\u2019ve always been a thinker. Since I was tiny, I had really big questions about death, war, why some people have it better than others.\u201d Via phonetics and audio books, she taught herself to read at the age of four and would notice newspaper headlines about the war in Iraq or endemic homelessness and get so worked up she found it impossible to just be a kid and play. Her parents encouraged her to keep a journal, play piano, write songs, but her anxiety got so bad that the family returned to Neneh\u2019s native home of Stockholm when Mabel was eight. She attended the prestigious music school Rytmus, whose past pupils include Robyn, but things didn\u2019t improve, and she spent a lot of time hiding in toilets. Sometimes she\u2019d cry so much she\u2019d throw up.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO4nmSLFcX4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sO4nmSLFcX4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cOh, I was definitely very bullied,\u201d she shudders, recalling the time a girl in her class invited every single person except Mabel to her birthday party. \u201cKids can be so horrible, very brutal. The only person to not be invited. I went home devastated.\u201d I wonder if she was picked on because of her famous parents, but she thinks it\u2019s more that she was \u201ca freak, I\u2019d make up songs, dress how I wanted to, I was this little weirdo really.

      "bodyText": "Gastroenteritis doesn\u2019t care if you\u2019re a pop star. It\u2019s not bothered if you have to drag yourself out of bed to appear on the Capital Breakfast show at 8.30am and then head across town to cover Mark Ronson and Camila Cabello\u2019s Find U Again for Radio 1\u2019s Live Lounge. You might have a debut album out that week, but gastroenteritis doesn\u2019t care about promo. \u201cIt started last week. I\u2019ve been travelling loads \u2013 America, Europe, Asia, back to America. I was doing a shoot when I started to feel tired and nauseous and weird,\u201d says Mabel Alabama Pearl McVey. A few hours later, she\u2019s throwing up side of stage before being whisked off to hospital where they initially diagnose appendicitis because she\u2019s in so much pain. While most of us would be under the duvet watching Cash in the Attic, for this 23-year-old there\u2019s no such thing as a sick day. When I meet her at a central London restaurant after her live session at Radio 1, she is sprightly, noting her Live Lounge was \u201cpossibly my best yet\u201d. She had to cancel in-stores and signings, but she\u2019s still doing some promo (such as this interview), plus, bizarrely, appearing at the British Grand Prix, where she does a lap in a car and presents a pole award at the qualifying round \u2013 because her debut album just came out and she wants it to hit the top spot. It\u2019s called High Expectations, a fitting title considering the reason Mabel got ill in the first place is the pressure she puts herself under. \u201cI\u2019m feeling better, but it\u2019s mainly when I get worked up, so I\u2019m trying not to stress \u2019cause it makes the acid in my stomach go mad. It\u2019s difficult because I care so much about what I do, so I say yes to everything because I want to be as big as I can be. But I\u2019ve realised that trying to be superwoman means at some point you\u2019ll hit a wall and not be able to do anything. Sometimes you have to sleep.\u201d Unfortunately, the album was kept off the top spot by Ed Sheeran and Lewis Capaldi, leaving Mabel with a No 3. \u201cI\u2019m so gutted. Well, I\u2019m not gutted. Obviously it\u2019s sick, but I really wanted a No 1. It\u2019s alright,\u201d she decides with a pretend pout, \u201cwe\u2019ll go again next time.\u201d Mabel officially began her musical life on SoundCloud in 2015 making dreamy R&amp;B songs such as Know Me Better and Thinking of You. She\u2019d feature in fashion magazines and Skepta videos, all slicked back hair, gold hoops and khaki bombers. But over time she dropped cool in favour of commercial; now it\u2019s thigh-high boots, selfies, Afrobeats and tropical house. In the beginning she was \u201cthis \u2018urban, west-London, making-90s-R&amp;B-over-a-breakbeat\u2019 artist,\u201d she says, \u201cand, yeah, I enjoyed that, it\u2019s a big part of who I am. But so is Afrobeat. I\u2019m multicultural, I\u2019ve got all these different sides and I want to showcase all of them.\u201d It\u2019s working; she\u2019s so far clocked up over one billion streams with both her own tunes and collaborations with Not3s, Jax Jones and Stefflon Don, with YouTube views at well over 300 million. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make music that you have to have a fucking degree to listen to,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to make music that a 14-year-old girl in Cardiff will love and relate to. I want to make pop music and tour the world and stand in big arenas. I want to make people feel good, I want to make them feel confident. I want to appeal to as many people as possible.\u201d Besides, it made her miserable, trying to be cool. \u201cI spent hours torturing myself thinking I should dress more like this, sing more like that. I missed a whole year of my life because I wasn\u2019t being myself and my career stalled. My mum\u2019s a fucking excellent example. The reason she was so successful was that she did not give a shit about what people thought.\u201d Mabel is the daughter of Neneh \u2018pregnant-on-TOTP-and-what\u2019 Cherry and Massive Attack producer Cameron McVey. She was born in M\u00e1laga, Spain and brought up in west London. The family later moved to Stockholm when Mabel was eight, before returning to London five years ago. She bought her own place \u2013 a two-bed new build which she keeps very clean, apart from piles of shoes and bags stacked on various surfaces. Her shelves are lined with self-help books: How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck, as well as Lily Allen and Michelle Obama\u2019s autobiographies. In the centre of the living room, there\u2019s a beautiful piano, above which is a framed poster by her godfather, the visionary stylist Judy Blame, who died in February 2018. \u201cIs it OK that I have my plaques up?\u201d she wonders, semi-rhetorically, nodding towards the discs that mark sales of chart success such as My Lover, Fine Line and Finders Keepers. While her manager, Radha Medar, encouraged Mabel to seek out some vulnerability for her album \u2013 a tone that\u2019s allowed deeper lyrical themes such as on OK (Anxiety Anthem) and Stockhlm Syndrome \u2013 it was her sassiest single, Don\u2019t Call Me Up, that provided her with her biggest and best hit so far. With its unusual structure, the song proved she could be both kooky and commercial, and found her a new audience in America. She was so scared about performing on Jimmy Fallon she made her mum and dad come with her. \u201cThey\u2019re good for nerves. And I had a little cry, that\u2019s good for nerves too. I cry about all the bad things that could happen, and then they won\u2019t happen.\u201d Like what? \u201cFalling on my face, singing the wrong words, you know, just generally being a twat.\u201d Mabel is really good company, which is a lovely surprise because it\u2019s hard to get a sense of her personality from her socials and live shows. She appears slick and shiny, so you can\u2019t tell that she\u2019s funny, smart and thoughtful. At one point she mentions writing a track about lazy lovers. \u201cI\u2019ve been shocked at how many guys won\u2019t lift a motherfucking finger and expect you to do all the fucking work. I\u2019m here doing backflips and the fucking splits,\u201d she splutters. \u201cWhat are you doing bro? Let\u2019s get moving!\u201d Such casual candour just doesn\u2019t match up to Mabel\u2019s much more polished pop star persona and she agrees there\u2019s a disparity somewhere. \u201cThere is so much more to me, I think I\u2019ve just been so focused on the music. I do want people to know me better,\u201d she adds. She\u2019s also passionately outspoken about many issues, including Grenfell. She was raised around the corner and headed straight there that terrible first morning, on 14 June 2017, with her family. \u201cWe donated as much as possible, cleaned, organised shit. My parents were driving food to people in hotels, families of five forced to live up on the 12th floor. So fucking traumatising. And people still don\u2019t have housing. It\u2019s disgusting. Just because it\u2019s not in the news every day, you have to remember that people just like you lost their kids, their husbands, their wives. It\u2019s gonna hurt for the rest of their lives. We have to do more. I won\u2019t forget. We can\u2019t forget.\u201d Mabel has always been empathetic, perhaps to a fault, although her mum reckons her sensitivity is her superpower. \u201cI\u2019ve had anxiety my whole life, I\u2019ve always been a thinker. Since I was tiny, I had really big questions about death, war, why some people have it better than others.\u201d Via phonetics and audio books, she taught herself to read at the age of four and would notice newspaper headlines about the war in Iraq or endemic homelessness and get so worked up she found it impossible to just be a kid and play. Her parents encouraged her to keep a journal, play piano, write songs, but her anxiety got so bad that the family returned to Neneh\u2019s native home of Stockholm when Mabel was eight. She attended the prestigious music school Rytmus, whose past pupils include Robyn, but things didn\u2019t improve, and she spent a lot of time hiding in toilets. Sometimes she\u2019d cry so much she\u2019d throw up. \u201cOh, I was definitely very bullied,\u201d she shudders, recalling the time a girl in her class invited every single person except Mabel to her birthday party. \u201cKids can be so horrible, very brutal. The only person to not be invited. I went home devastated.\u201d I wonder if she was picked on because of her famous parents, but she thinks it\u2019s more that she was \u201ca freak, I\u2019d make up songs, dress how I wanted to, I was this little weirdo really. I felt like an alien.\u201d She acknowledges that her family were \u201cvery unconventional\u201d. There was Neneh and Cameron, jazz trumpeter step-grandfather Don Cherry, as well Neneh\u2019s birth father, Sierra Leonean musician Ahmadu Jah. In the cool, calm and collected Stockholm they stood out a mile. \u201cWhenever my family did come to anything at school, there was always millions of us and we\u2019d come in late, with all this noise and god knows what.

He set his strange 1890s novel The Well-Beloved on Dorset\u2019s Isle of Portland, which stretches out \u201clike the head of a bird\u201d into the channel. Connected to the mainland by a causeway and long, pebbly Chesil Beach, the \u201cisland\u201d is famous for the pale limestone that built Saint Paul\u2019s cathedral. There are still quarries here, and striking stone structures: churches and castles, harbours and prisons. The three of us arrive in Weymouth, a couple of miles north of Portland, from different directions. My mum (using her bus pass) along the coast, my brother by rail from Somerset, and me from Essex (via London). The Waterloo to Weymouth train takes three hours.

      "body": "<p>Back in March, everything was looking good for Nikhil Dudeja. He and his wife Richa were about to buy their first dream home with the \u00a345,500 deposit they had saved up with significant help from their parents, and the purchase was progressing well. While they were away on holiday Nikhil received an email from their solicitor asking for their deposit money to be paid. He went into his Lloyds banking app and transferred the sum over in two payments.</p> <p>Five months on and their dream of home ownership lies in tatters. Fraudsters had hacked into the estate agent\u2019s email system, and had seen enough to be able to create a fake email from his lawyer, telling him where to send the \u00a345,000. </p> <p>So rather than sending the money to his solicitor\u2019s account, it instead went into an HSBC business account that had been fraudulently set up in Kilburn, north London.</p> <p>Since then the 31-year-old, who works in financial services, has been battling to be refunded. New fraud compensation rules that have helped other victims in the same position came into force at the end of May, and would in all likelihood have meant he would have been refunded by his bank. However, Lloyds has refused to refund the couple, on the basis that he didn\u2019t take sufficient care when making the transfer. HSBC has also denied any liability.</p> <p>The Metropolitan police have investigated a number of suspicious account openings at HSBC\u2019s Kilburn branch. In a letter to Dudeja seen by Guardian Money, the police said they were investigating if the fraud was facilitated by an insider. Dudeja says HSBC should also have spotted that the receiving account was fraudulent as it was opened online with company details that the police said appeared not to exist.</p> <p>The estate agent dealing with the purchase confirmed that its email system was hacked into. And yet, Dudeja says, all the companies involved have washed their hands of any liability and refuse to help him.</p> <p>The couple are just the latest people to fall victim to the most sophisticated of scammers who have specifically targeted property buyers. In 2017 Money <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/jan/14/lost-67000-conveyancing-scam-friday-afternoon-fraud-legal-sector-email-hacker\" title=\"\">featured the case of Howard Mollet</a>, a charity worker who lost his \u00a367,000 life savings. Another couple <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/oct/21/couple-lose-120000-email-hacking-fraud-legal-sector\" title=\"\">lost \u00a3120,000 in similar circumstances</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThis whole experience has been devastating,\u201d Dudeja says. \u201cThe email I received came from the exact same address as used by our solicitor. The bank details were provided on a solicitor\u2019s company letterhead along with the signature of the solicitor dealing with our case. I was expecting to make the payment and just did so. It was the perfect scam.\u201d</p> <p>When the true horror of what had happened emerged, Dudeja visited a Lloyds branch in central London where, he says, staff treated him as if he had committed the crime, rather been the victim of it. \u201cThere was no compassion shown by the branch manager but instead they resorted to victim-shaming me and essentially told me the scam was my fault. I asked them how it was possible to put my solicitor\u2019s name into the payment transfer, and the money go to another company\u2019s account?</p> <p>\u201cThis is when they revealed that the name field is not significant, which is why they give a warning on their website. I checked their website and a warning was there, but there was no warning on the mobile app which I used to make these payments. In fact, the app gave a green tick mark on the payee name, giving an impression that the name of the recipient bank account had been checked and approved, so I always thought the name field was checked by Lloyds bank,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Lloyds has since offered him \u00a3350 compensation for the way he was treated by the branch, but refused to refund the \u00a345,500. However, if his Lloyds experience alarmed Dudeja, his dealings with HSBC and in particular the branch in Kilburn left him a state of shock.</p> <p>It soon emerged that the fraudulent account to which he transferred his money was in the name of a company that did not exist and was registered to a local residential address. Met police originally dropped their inquiry into his case but reopened it after, he was told, it began receiving multiple fraud cases in subsequent days, all related to the HSBC Kilburn branch.</p> <p>He was also told by police that there was an ongoing investigation with Royal Mail concerning postal staff in the area. \u201cI have asked HSBC how staff at the Kilburn branch allowed all this to happen and they claim they followed industry protocols, and again have denied all liability. I have asked [HSBC]to pass on to my bank the account holder information, which is a right under the terms of the Payments Systems Regulator rules, but Lloyds has flatly refused to give it to me.\u201d</p> <p>Dudeja says the episode has left him wondering if the UK banking system is only interested in protecting its profits rather than admitting its failures and doing the right thing by customers.</p> <p>\u201cWe were targeted by organised criminals who have exploited significant failures in the banking system to help steal our money,\u201d he says. \u201cA new code has come into force but Lloyds refuses to abide by it in our case. The impact on us as a family has been devastating. My parents in India had spent 20 years saving up to help us buy a home and they are heartbroken, and amazed that this can happen in Britain in 2019.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for Lloyds said it has a great deal of sympathy for Dudeja, but it would not help him.</p> <p>\u201cAs soon as he made us aware of this scam, around 10 days after he had made the payments, we immediately contacted the receiving bank to help recover his money, but no funds remained. Before making any payments by bank transfer, and especially involving significant amounts of money, we would strongly recommend phoning the recipient on a known number to confirm any payment details sent by email.</p> <p>\u201cWe appreciate this has been a very distressing experience for Mr Dudeja and we have apologised for the level of service he received while we investigated his case.\u201d</p> <p>In a statement, HSBC said: \u201cWhere a report of a potentially fraudulent payment or scam is received we take appropriate and timely action.</p> <p>\u201cHaving looked at the specific detail of Mr Dudeja\u2019s case, we have determined that the payment had been withdrawn before we were notified by Mr Dudeja\u2019s bank and we could not reasonably have acted sooner.\u201d</p> <p>It said it employs a wide range of methods to detect fraud, adding: \u201cWe are confident in our account opening procedures. Various checks are performed during the account opening process, and these checks are in line with the industry standard, supported by the Financial Conduct Authority.\u201d</p>",

However, Lloyds has refused to refund the couple, on the basis that he didn\u2019t take sufficient care when making the transfer. HSBC has also denied any liability. The Metropolitan police have investigated a number of suspicious account openings at HSBC\u2019s Kilburn branch. In a letter to Dudeja seen by Guardian Money, the police said they were investigating if the fraud was facilitated by an insider. Dudeja says HSBC should also have spotted that the receiving account was fraudulent as it was opened online with company details that the police said appeared not to exist. The estate agent dealing with the purchase confirmed that its email system was hacked into. And yet, Dudeja says, all the companies involved have washed their hands of any liability and refuse to help him. The couple are just the latest people to fall victim to the most sophisticated of scammers who have specifically targeted property buyers. In 2017 Money featured the case of Howard Mollet, a charity worker who lost his \u00a367,000 life savings. Another couple lost \u00a3120,000 in similar circumstances. \u201cThis whole experience has been devastating,\u201d Dudeja says. \u201cThe email I received came from the exact same address as used by our solicitor. The bank details were provided on a solicitor\u2019s company letterhead along with the signature of the solicitor dealing with our case. I was expecting to make the payment and just did so. It was the perfect scam.\u201d When the true horror of what had happened emerged, Dudeja visited a Lloyds branch in central London where, he says, staff treated him as if he had committed the crime, rather been the victim of it. \u201cThere was no compassion shown by the branch manager but instead they resorted to victim-shaming me and essentially told me the scam was my fault. I asked them how it was possible to put my solicitor\u2019s name into the payment transfer, and the money go to another company\u2019s account? \u201cThis is when they revealed that the name field is not significant, which is why they give a warning on their website. I checked their website and a warning was there, but there was no warning on the mobile app which I used to make these payments. In fact, the app gave a green tick mark on the payee name, giving an impression that the name of the recipient bank account had been checked and approved, so I always thought the name field was checked by Lloyds bank,\u201d he says. Lloyds has since offered him \u00a3350 compensation for the way he was treated by the branch, but refused to refund the \u00a345,500. However, if his Lloyds experience alarmed Dudeja, his dealings with HSBC and in particular the branch in Kilburn left him a state of shock. It soon emerged that the fraudulent account to which he transferred his money was in the name of a company that did not exist and was registered to a local residential address. Met police originally dropped their inquiry into his case but reopened it after, he was told, it began receiving multiple fraud cases in subsequent days, all related to the HSBC Kilburn branch. He was also told by police that there was an ongoing investigation with Royal Mail concerning postal staff in the area. \u201cI have asked HSBC how staff at the Kilburn branch allowed all this to happen and they claim they followed industry protocols, and again have denied all liability. I have asked [HSBC]to pass on to my bank the account holder information, which is a right under the terms of the Payments Systems Regulator rules, but Lloyds has flatly refused to give it to me.\u201d Dudeja says the episode has left him wondering if the UK banking system is only interested in protecting its profits rather than admitting its failures and doing the right thing by customers. \u201cWe were targeted by organised criminals who have exploited significant failures in the banking system to help steal our money,\u201d he says. \u201cA new code has come into force but Lloyds refuses to abide by it in our case. The impact on us as a family has been devastating. My parents in India had spent 20 years saving up to help us buy a home and they are heartbroken, and amazed that this can happen in Britain in 2019.\u201d A spokesman for Lloyds said it has a great deal of sympathy for Dudeja, but it would not help him. \u201cAs soon as he made us aware of this scam, around 10 days after he had made the payments, we immediately contacted the receiving bank to help recover his money, but no funds remained. Before making any payments by bank transfer, and especially involving significant amounts of money, we would strongly recommend phoning the recipient on a known number to confirm any payment details sent by email. \u201cWe appreciate this has been a very distressing experience for Mr Dudeja and we have apologised for the level of service he received while we investigated his case.\u201d In a statement, HSBC said: \u201cWhere a report of a potentially fraudulent payment or scam is received we take appropriate and timely action. \u201cHaving looked at the specific detail of Mr Dudeja\u2019s case, we have determined that the payment had been withdrawn before we were notified by Mr Dudeja\u2019s bank and we could not reasonably have acted sooner.\u201d It said it employs a wide range of methods to detect fraud, adding: \u201cWe are confident in our account opening procedures. Various checks are performed during the account opening process, and these checks are in line with the industry standard, supported by the Financial Conduct Authority.\u201d",

Add the butter, sugar and honey, then mix with the paddle attachment until a dough comes together.</p> <p>Tip out on to a clean work surface and bring together by hand, until you have a smooth, firm dough. Divide the dough in half and roll into two 5cm-thick logs. Wrap in parchment and put in the fridge until thoroughly chilled. If you\u2019re making ahead, put in the freezer until needed and bake from frozen.</p> <p>To bake the biscuits, heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4. Unwrap the dough, and space at least 10cm apart on baking trays. Bake for 15-20 minutes, squashing now and then with the base of a heavy pan, until they are an even, deep golden brown. Eventually the biscuits should be fully flattened: the ideal thickness is 5mm.</p> <p>Remove the biscuits from the oven and leave to cool slightly, then, while still warm and soft, cut each biscuit into fingers, ideally 10cm long and 2cm wide, but any shape will do. Sprinkle the biscuits liberally with flaky sea salt and leave to cool completely.</p> <p>To make the ice-cream, reheat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5. On separate roasting trays, roast the nuts for eight minutes, or until aromatic and just taking on a tiny bit of colour. Keep the roasted pistachios whole, but chop the roasted almonds into chunks \u2013 the size is up to you. Put the chopped almonds in a spaghetti basket or wide-meshed sieve, then shake to remove any fine dust. This might seem a bit of a faff, but it\u2019s worth it, as any almond dust will give the ice-cream an unpleasant grainy texture.</p> <p>Meanwhile, bring the cream and milk slowly to a boil in a pan; turn off the heat before it boils over. While you wait for the milk and cream to boil, whisk the egg yolks in a large bowl with the honey, sugar and glucose or invert sugar syrup. The mixture should be as smooth as possible, but not aerated. Pour the hot milk and cream gradually into the egg and honey mixture, whisking continually as you pour. Add the mixture back to the pan and cook very slowly on a low heat, stirring all the while with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, until it reaches 82C/180F, or thickens to the point when it coats the back of a wooden spoon and a line drawn with your finger over the spoon remains unbroken. Pour the cooked custard through a fine sieve into a deep tray that will fit in your refrigerator. At this point, add the roasted nuts to the custard; leave the tray of custard to cool to room temperature, stirring now and then to stop it forming a skin, and refrigerate until chilled.</p> <p>Once chilled, stir in the orange zest, orange-blossom and the nougat pieces. Churn in an ice-cream maker as per manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Alternatively, put the tray in the freezer, stirring the mixture every 30 minutes until evenly frozen.</p> <p>I like to serve a couple of scoops of ice-cream per person with a biscuit nestled in the bowl alongside.</p> <h2><strong>Panna cotta and cherries poached in pastis</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c4f77539c9d419bf890a51fafb5cd433680454af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4f77539c9d419bf890a51fafb5cd433680454af/0_13_2825_2824/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alex Jackson\u2019s panna cotta and cherries poached in pastis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alex Jackson\u2019s panna cotta and cherries poached in pastis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ola O Smit/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Prep <strong>20 min</strong><br>Cook <strong>20 min</strong><br>Chill <strong>2 hr</strong><br>Makes<strong> 4</strong></p> <p>For the panna cotta<br><strong>600ml double cream</strong><br><strong>1 vanilla pod </strong>or 1 tsp vanilla extract<br><strong>Rind of \u00bd unwaxed lemon</strong>,<strong> </strong>peeled with a vegetable peeler<br><strong>1\u00bd leaves gelatine</strong><br><strong>75ml whole milk</strong><br><strong>75g icing sugar</strong></p> <p>For the poached cherries<br><strong>100ml pastis</strong><br><strong>100ml water</strong><br><strong>50g caster sugar</strong><br><strong>1 thyme sprig</strong><br><strong>400g finest French dark red cherries</strong>,<strong> </strong>stalks removed and pitted</p> <p>Pour 450ml of the cream into a pan, add the vanilla and lemon rind, then bring to a boil.

Add the butter, sugar and honey, then mix with the paddle attachment until a dough comes together. Tip out on to a clean work surface and bring together by hand, until you have a smooth, firm dough. Divide the dough in half and roll into two 5cm-thick logs. Wrap in parchment and put in the fridge until thoroughly chilled. If you\u2019re making ahead, put in the freezer until needed and bake from frozen. To bake the biscuits, heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4. Unwrap the dough, and space at least 10cm apart on baking trays. Bake for 15-20 minutes, squashing now and then with the base of a heavy pan, until they are an even, deep golden brown. Eventually the biscuits should be fully flattened: the ideal thickness is 5mm. Remove the biscuits from the oven and leave to cool slightly, then, while still warm and soft, cut each biscuit into fingers, ideally 10cm long and 2cm wide, but any shape will do. Sprinkle the biscuits liberally with flaky sea salt and leave to cool completely. To make the ice-cream, reheat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5. On separate roasting trays, roast the nuts for eight minutes, or until aromatic and just taking on a tiny bit of colour. Keep the roasted pistachios whole, but chop the roasted almonds into chunks \u2013 the size is up to you.

Pour the cooked custard through a fine sieve into a deep tray that will fit in your refrigerator. At this point, add the roasted nuts to the custard; leave the tray of custard to cool to room temperature, stirring now and then to stop it forming a skin, and refrigerate until chilled. Once chilled, stir in the orange zest, orange-blossom and the nougat pieces. Churn in an ice-cream maker as per manufacturer\u2019s instructions.

Matthew Phillip, the carnival\u2019s executive director, said the event \u2013 which takes place over the bank holiday weekend and is Europe\u2019s biggest street festival \u2013 is designed to break down barriers. \u201cCarnival was brought to us by the Windrush generation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was that influx of people which created carnival in the first place. It was a chance for the diverse community of Notting Hill to come together and celebrate the fact that we\u2019ve got a lot more in common with people than differences. That\u2019s still relevant today.\u201d It also offers a chance for a country \u2013 that is at its most divided in decades, according to recent studies \u2013 to forget its differences. \u201cIt is absolutely more important now than ever,\u201d said Phillip. \u201cYou look around carnival and Ladbroke Grove and you see people from all walks of life celebrating and enjoying food together. All you\u2019ll see is smiling faces. It brings everybody together.\u201d He added: \u201cI really believe that carnival should be celebrated and highlighted and the whole nation should be proud of it. It puts the UK on the map for that one weekend and it highlights London as a city that\u2019s welcoming and inclusive of all people from all walks of life.\u201d The event, which is celebrating its 53rd year, is estimated to bring more than \u00a3100m to London\u2019s economy and is the second largest carnival in the world, behind Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. One million people are predicted to attend the event, which also makes it the largest public order challenge for the Metropolitan police. Last year the Met installed knife arches after using \u201cBig Brother-style\u201d facial recognition in 2017, where the system was wrong 98% of the time, according to a report by the campaign group Big Brother Watch. On the Sunday of last year\u2019s event the Met activated a section 60 order across the carnival area in west London after receiving intelligence, meaning stop and search powers could be enforced.

For me that is brilliant, just what I need.\u201d The Strata Florida project is one of the most intriguing digs in the UK. For starters, the site, 16 miles inland from Aberystwyth on the edge of the Cambrian mountains, has a fascinating and colourful history. Though it is not very well known, even in Wales, there is growing evidence that Strata Florida was central to the development of the country\u2019s culture and language. It features the remains of a sprawling Cistercian abbey founded in the 12th century and is the resting place both for medieval Welsh princes and possibly of the great 14th century Welsh poet Dafydd ap Gwilym, associations that have led to it being described as the Welsh Westminster Abbey. Part of the Strata Florida (Latin for \u201cVale of Flowers\u201d) site is managed by Cadw, the government body that looks after many historical sites across Wales, and it attracts a steady flow of visitors. But over the last couple of decades archeologists have unearthed evidence that the site is vast, perhaps the largest Cistercian abbey in the UK, and has been a place of worship for thousands of years. An organisation called the Strata Florida Trust has been set up to try to uncover more of the area\u2019s amazing history and make people across Wales and further afield more aware of the site. But the chair of the Strata Florida Trust, David Austin, who has worked on the site for decades, said there were challenges \u2013 in particular the size of the site and the shortage of field archeologists to uncover its secrets. Rather than giving up, the trust \u2013 which is supported by the The Prince\u2019s Foundation and the Allchurches Trust \u2013 has worked hard to recruit non-professionals to help the dig and the project\u2019s first archaeology field school began this week. \u201cIt\u2019s such an important site,\u201d said Austin. \u201cTopographically, spiritually and intellectually it is at the heart of Wales.

To Arana, the legacies of these forces continue to cause suffering for millions.</p> <p>The first section, Silver, focus on precious metals, moving between the Spanish conquistadors\u2019 thirst for <em>plata </em>and the impoverished Peruvians of today who chip away in dangerous conditions for a pittance from foreign mining companies.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The most worrying aspect of her book is the repeated claim that violence is somehow in the blood of all Latin Americans</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>From there the book turns to Sword, or violence. There is no doubt Arana, <a href=\"http://mariearana.net/maries-story/\">who is Peruvian-American</a>, cares deeply about Peru and the rest of the Spanish-speaking world, but she does it no favours here, arguing that there is something inherent to Latin American people that propels them to embrace violence and \u201cstrongman\u201d leaders. These chapters are a kaleidoscope of horror, as she vividly describes centuries of uprisings, dictatorships and civil wars.</p> <p>The final section, Stone, examines faith and religion.

      "bodyText": "Writing in 1811, during the early rumblings of the Spanish American independence movements, Thomas Jefferson harboured little optimism about the \u201cgreat field of political experiment [that] is opening in our neighbourhood\u201d. He did not believe the people of South and Central America were capable of establishing successful republics. \u201cI fear the degrading ignorance into which their priests &amp; kings have sunk them, has disqualified them from the maintenance, or even knowledge of their rights,\u201d he wrote, predicting \u201cthat much blood may be shed for little improvement in their condition\u201d. Two centuries later, in Marie Arana\u2019s Silver, Sword &amp; Stone: Three Crucibles of the Latin American Story, this harsh assessment appears to hold true. Setting herself the \u201cimpossible task\u201d of trying to explain \u201ca hemisphere and its people\u201d, Arana organizes her book around these three tropes: the kings, bloodshed and priests that so dimmed Jefferson\u2019s view. To Arana, the legacies of these forces continue to cause suffering for millions. The first section, Silver, focus on precious metals, moving between the Spanish conquistadors\u2019 thirst for plata and the impoverished Peruvians of today who chip away in dangerous conditions for a pittance from foreign mining companies. From there the book turns to Sword, or violence. There is no doubt Arana, who is Peruvian-American, cares deeply about Peru and the rest of the Spanish-speaking world, but she does it no favours here, arguing that there is something inherent to Latin American people that propels them to embrace violence and \u201cstrongman\u201d leaders. These chapters are a kaleidoscope of horror, as she vividly describes centuries of uprisings, dictatorships and civil wars. The final section, Stone, examines faith and religion. The narrative goes back to pre-Columbian practices and examines the disruption wrought by Christianity, while also moving into the present to discuss rising Protestant evangelicalism and its challenge to Catholic dominance. Arana should be lauded for presenting such a complex historical panorama but as she notes, her book \u201cdoes not pretend to be a definitive, comprehensive history\u201d. Her previous book was a biography of Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar but Arana is also a novelist and memoirist. She brings poetic touches to her prose, though at points it veers into melodrama or cliche: irritatingly, the phrase \u201csince time immemorial\u201d crops up many times.

That\u2019s because the H\u00f4tel du Palais occupies a special niche in British political history. It is the only building outside this country in which a prime minister has ever kissed hands and been asked to form a government. This happened in April 1908, when King Edward VII, who was a regular at the hotel, summoned the Liberal chancellor of the exchequer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/apr/03/past\" title=\"\">Herbert Asquith</a>, from London to succeed the terminally ill Henry Campbell-Bannerman in Downing Street.</p> <p>Nothing about this episode could possibly happen today. Asquith, who lived in Cavendish Square in London\u2019s West End, took a cab from his home after dinner and, travelling entirely alone, caught the evening boat train from Charing Cross station to Paris, continuing on to Biarritz the following day. Not a single journalist followed him or even knew he was making the trip. Once installed in the H\u00f4tel du Palais, Asquith donned a frock coat and went to the king, who appointed him prime minister in his suite. \u201cThe weather here is vile beyond description, pouring rain and plenty of wind,\u201d <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MXUsAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT147&amp;lpg=PT147&amp;dq=asquith+The+weather+here+is+vile+beyond+description,+pouring+rain+and+plenty+of+wind&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WVAOt2wrn5&amp;sig=ACfU3U1OK7Zp3-wVKwUigO1kR-Clr0Pyyw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiy7ZKe55jkAhUKJ1AKHcB1DgAQ6AEwAHoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=asquith%20The%20weather%20here%20is%20vile%20beyond%20description%2C%20pouring%20rain%20and%20plenty%20of%20wind&amp;f=false\" title=\"\">Asquith reported to his wife</a>.

Few of the delegates may be aware that it was here, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2009/sep/22/highcliff-hotel-political-history\" title=\"\">in May 1940</a>, that the Labour national executive committee took the historic decision to allow party members to serve in a wartime national government under Winston Churchill. And when Labour meet in Brighton, the delegates will walk each morning past the restored Grand Hotel in which the IRA <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/from-the-archive-blog/2014/oct/03/brighton-bombing-grand-hotel-tory-conservative-conference-1984\" title=\"\">came close to murdering Margaret Thatcher</a> in October 1984 during that year\u2019s Conservative conference. History was changed in both.</p> <p>Hotels do not only come into their own at party conferences. They host international gatherings, too, like this weekend\u2019s in Biarritz. Probably the hotel industry\u2019s finest diplomatic hour was when Parisian hotels were commandeered en masse for the delegates to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/from-the-archive-blog/2019/jan/09/paris-peace-conference-first-world-war-1919\" title=\"\">peace conference of 1919</a> \u2013 the British under David Lloyd George stayed in the five-star Majestic hotel near the Arc de Triomphe.

One of Asquith\u2019s successors, Stanley Baldwin, regularly spent his summers at the Grand Hotel d\u2019Albion in the French mountain spa town of Aix-les-Bains. Baldwin liked the hotel \u2013 which was long ago converted into apartments \u2013 because he enjoyed solitary hill walks and because, \u201c<a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TvfnEsnjrSIC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=stanley+baldwin+everyone+knows+one+and+they+leave+one+alone+and+respect+our+desire+for+peace+and+quiet&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hz4vLKatdn&amp;sig=ACfU3U0RSOEsEZ_VnpxgeekbmCMc2t0NNg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwju3pPk6ZjkAhVzRhUIHQPvBvYQ6AEwAXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=stanley%20baldwin%20everyone%20knows%20one%20and%20they%20leave%20one%20alone%20and%20respect%20our%20desire%20for%20peace%20and%20quiet&amp;f=false\" title=\"\">Everyone knows one</a> and they leave one alone and respect our desire for peace and quiet.\u201d Baldwin would attempt to cut himself off from politics for several weeks at the Albion, and only followed events by reading the French newspapers over breakfast. Even so, a newsreel exists of the Baldwins sitting at a cafe in the French resort in 1923. A PM could be papped on holiday, even then, or maybe \u2013 since Baldwin looks extremely good-humoured and relaxed in the clip \u2013 it was an early piece of smart prime ministerial media management.</p> <p>Some enterprising chronicler of the leisure industry should surely write a full account of the importance of hotels in political history. After all, now that the president of the United States is a hotel tycoon, and is seemingly always keen to use politics and diplomacy to advance his hotel-building business plans, the interface between hotels and politics has rarely been more relevant.</p> <p>\u2022 Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Boris Johnson will not be the first serving British prime minister to set foot in the hotel that was once a favourite of Napoleon III and Queen Victoria. That\u2019s because the H\u00f4tel du Palais occupies a special niche in British political history. It is the only building outside this country in which a prime minister has ever kissed hands and been asked to form a government. This happened in April 1908, when King Edward VII, who was a regular at the hotel, summoned the Liberal chancellor of the exchequer, Herbert Asquith, from London to succeed the terminally ill Henry Campbell-Bannerman in Downing Street. Nothing about this episode could possibly happen today. Asquith, who lived in Cavendish Square in London\u2019s West End, took a cab from his home after dinner and, travelling entirely alone, caught the evening boat train from Charing Cross station to Paris, continuing on to Biarritz the following day. Not a single journalist followed him or even knew he was making the trip. Once installed in the H\u00f4tel du Palais, Asquith donned a frock coat and went to the king, who appointed him prime minister in his suite. \u201cThe weather here is vile beyond description, pouring rain and plenty of wind,\u201d Asquith reported to his wife. He got back to London two days later. This time the press were there in force. Although no other hotel either in Britain or elsewhere has ever hosted such an event, hotels often play a role in politics. Next month, for example, the Liberal Democrats will centre their autumn conference \u2013 if it goes ahead \u2013 in Bournemouth\u2019s Highcliff Hotel. Few of the delegates may be aware that it was here, in May 1940, that the Labour national executive committee took the historic decision to allow party members to serve in a wartime national government under Winston Churchill. And when Labour meet in Brighton, the delegates will walk each morning past the restored Grand Hotel in which the IRA came close to murdering Margaret Thatcher in October 1984 during that year\u2019s Conservative conference. History was changed in both. Hotels do not only come into their own at party conferences. They host international gatherings, too, like this weekend\u2019s in Biarritz. Probably the hotel industry\u2019s finest diplomatic hour was when Parisian hotels were commandeered en masse for the delegates to the peace conference of 1919 \u2013 the British under David Lloyd George stayed in the five-star Majestic hotel near the Arc de Triomphe. But few hotel meetings are more famous than the one in 1944, in the Mount Washington Hotel in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, which attempted to restructure the global financial system, and at which the UK was represented by John Maynard Keynes, who had a spectacular river and mountain view from suite 129. His wife Lydia\u2019s ballet exercises kept the US delegation awake at night, they complained. Hotels also provide relaxation for politicians \u2013 or used to. One of Asquith\u2019s successors, Stanley Baldwin, regularly spent his summers at the Grand Hotel d\u2019Albion in the French mountain spa town of Aix-les-Bains. Baldwin liked the hotel \u2013 which was long ago converted into apartments \u2013 because he enjoyed solitary hill walks and because, \u201cEveryone knows one and they leave one alone and respect our desire for peace and quiet.\u201d Baldwin would attempt to cut himself off from politics for several weeks at the Albion, and only followed events by reading the French newspapers over breakfast. Even so, a newsreel exists of the Baldwins sitting at a cafe in the French resort in 1923. A PM could be papped on holiday, even then, or maybe \u2013 since Baldwin looks extremely good-humoured and relaxed in the clip \u2013 it was an early piece of smart prime ministerial media management. Some enterprising chronicler of the leisure industry should surely write a full account of the importance of hotels in political history. After all, now that the president of the United States is a hotel tycoon, and is seemingly always keen to use politics and diplomacy to advance his hotel-building business plans, the interface between hotels and politics has rarely been more relevant. \u2022 Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "Students have arranged red plastic cups in the shape of a swastika. They\u2019ve held up \u201cWe love White\u201d signs. They\u2019ve chanted a Nazi marching song. Several high schools in Orange county, California, have been engulfed in scandal in the past year over racist behavior by some of their white students. This week, videos surfaced showing a group of boys from Pacifica high school in Garden Grove doing the Sieg Heil salute and marching with German and Confederate flags. The latest controversy has reignited anger and anxiety among Jewish communities and students of color, with many questioning why this keeps happening. To some, the answer is obvious: white supremacy has a long history in Orange county, and officials aren\u2019t taking the threats seriously. The consequences, they say, could be deadly. In the 1980s and 1990s, Orange county was known as a recruitment hub for neo-Nazi groups, sometimes resulting in violence and hate crimes. And although it now counts more registered Democrats than Republicans, the county was long one of the blue state\u2019s rightwing strongholds, with xenophobic, racist and homophobic politicians holding some of its top jobs. \u201cPeople have this skewed perspective of California \u2013 that it\u2019s liberal, that it\u2019s hippies,\u201d said Melissa Shaw, a former Pacifica high school student, who is Jewish. \u201cThat was not my experience in Orange county \u2026 I felt like I was running from the neo-Nazis.\u201d Experts say the far right is still active and dangerous in the region. A member of a local militant neo-Nazi group was charged last year for murdering a 19-year-old gay Jewish classmate. The so-called Rise Above Movement (Ram), one of the most prominent white supremacist groups linked to recent violence, is concentrated in Orange county, according to the Anti-Defamation League. \u201cOrange county is a safe haven for Nazis,\u201d said Jaime Segall-Gutierrez, a local civil rights attorney. \u201cNot enough is being done to discourage this type of behavior. If anything, it\u2019s being encouraged \u2026 because of the lack of accountability.\u201d Decades of swastikas and \u2018sweeping under the rug\u2019 \u201cMy initial reaction was, \u2018same old shit,\u2019\u201d Flo Martin, a former Pacifica high teacher, said about the new Nazi salute videos.

      "bodyText": "In the days after Donald Trump derailed Rashida Tlaib\u2019s plans to visit Israel and the Palestinian territories, the president taunted and repeatedly attacked the Michigan Democrat, calling her obnoxious, violent and crazy. After Tlaib wept during a press conference, Trump tweeted that he did not \u201cbuy her tears\u201d. He then accused Tlaib of antisemitism, even as he used antisemitic tropes himself. These were of course only the latest salvos in an ongoing battle between Trump and Tlaib, Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ayanna Pressley, the four progressive Democrats who together make up \u201cthe Squad\u201d. In her first in-depth interview since her planned visit with Omar to the Palestinian territories was cancelled, Tlaib said Trump was attacking women of color for a reason. \u201cIt\u2019s been very clear to me, especially this last week, that he\u2019s scared of us,\u201d Tlaib said. \u201cHe\u2019s afraid of women of color \u2026 because we\u2019re not afraid of him and we\u2019re not afraid to speak up and say that we have a white supremacist in the White House who has a hate agenda. \u201cHe\u2019s afraid because we have a real agenda for the American people.\u201d Trump appears increasingly eager to present Tlaib\u2019s allies \u2013 all in their first term in the House \u2013 as Democrat party leaders. \u201cShe and her [three] friends are the new face of the Democrat [sic] party,\u201d Trump tweeted on Tuesday. \u201cLive with it!\u201d Though establishment Democrats fear that perception taking hold among the electorate and some political commentators say it is a shrewd move from the president, Tlaib disagrees. Many of the progressive ideas she and her allies are pushing \u2013 eliminating student debt, Medicare for All, taxing the rich, strengthening civil rights, ending corporate control of government \u2013 are, she said, popular not just with Democrats but with independents and some Republicans, too. \u201cHe can bring it,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause we actually have policies that came from the people. What he\u2019s doing by choosing us four as his target is trying to distract folks from the fact that more people are living in poverty than ever, because he has failed as a president.\u201d While her willingness to stand up to the president and her position on Palestinian issues ensures national attention, Tlaib insisted she was not solely focused on battling Trump. Instead, she said, she is determined to address problems in Michigan\u2019s 13th district, the nation\u2019s third poorest, covering Detroit and some lower-income suburbs. After taking office, Tlaib developed a broad set of anti-poverty programs while building four constituent services offices, separate from campaign operations. Staff help low-income residents avert water shutoffs, access tax credits and find free legal services. They also help connect seniors with food assistance, among other services. Tlaib said she was protecting her district from the Koch brothers\u2019 toxic petroleum coke piles along the Detroit river, and noted that she was involved in efforts to take on Marathon, a major polluter in south-west Detroit. Tlaib has introduced 11 bills with a focus on systemic poverty. Detroit\u2019s auto insurance rates are the nation\u2019s highest; two bills would help lower them by stopping \u201credlining\u201d, a controversial practice of charging far more to those who are Detroit residents, or widows, or single, as well as those with low credit scores and lower education levels, among other factors not related to driving. Another bill would limit facial recognition technology used by Detroit police, which activists say misidentifies black people at a high rate. Tlaib is also planning to introduce the Justice for All Civil Rights Act, which would lower the legal threshold for proving that a policy, law or practice is discriminatory. She points to auto insurance redlining, education and banks\u2019 minority lending practices as areas of concern. Such ideas appear to make Tlaib popular in her district, where recent polling put her favorability rating at 76%. She said constituents recognize that she doesn\u2019t \u201csell out\u201d. \u201cThey\u2019re done with the corporate assault on working families,\u201d she said. \u201cHealth insurance, auto insurance, banks that don\u2019t lend to our families, surveillance \u2013 so much of it is tied to corporate greed.\u201d \u2018Do something\u2019 Still, it is occasionally alleged that she ignores her district. Tlaib said many of her critics are establishment types and asked why she hasn\u2019t heard them speaking up about \u201cinjustices in Detroit\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s been silence, crickets,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople will target me, but my work, my vote says the complete opposite of what the say.\u201d The pro-Israel lobby and some conservative Michigan Jews who do not live in Tlaib\u2019s district plan to meddle in her 2020 re-election campaign. They see her as vulnerable because she represents a majority black district and edged a black candidate by 900 votes in the 2018 primary. The pro-Israel lobby plans to back a black challenger. However, polling puts Tlaib up 56%-19% in a hypothetical match up against her most likely opponent, Brenda Jones, the black Detroit city council president. Furthermore, Detroit Jewish groups had Tlaib\u2019s back during the controversy over her planned visit to the Palestinian territories. She said she had always maintained a strong relationship with Jewish lawmakers and leaders. Tlaib probably first got Trump\u2019s attention after winning her election and declaring it time to \u201cimpeach the motherfucker\u201d. Though 2020 is quickly approaching and it appears some Democrat leaders are trying to wind down the clock on an impeachment attempt, Tlaib said House Democrats have an obligation to \u201chold the corrupt president accountable\u201d. Trump still hasn\u2019t divested from his businesses and continues using the White House to profit, she said. \u201cWhy not pass it, send it to the Senate and let them deal with the millions of Americans who are on our door saying \u2018Do something\u2019,\u201d she said, noting that more than half of Democrats in the House now support impeachment and their numbers keep growing. Either way, she said she was confident Trump\u2019s time in office was limited, and added that he does not seem to realize the Squad is much larger than the four women in Washington. It\u2019s also all the women in the freshman class who come from diverse backgrounds, she said, and have overcome challenges, and are up in front of Congress asking \u201cWhy?\u201d It\u2019s that Squad and the American people who are standing up to Trump, Tlaib said. \u201cI really believe that when we work together, we can defeat this type of hate and the attacks on our families \u2013 not just racism, but systemic oppression,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of that can be knocked down if we come together, because there\u2019s more of us than them.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>In America, there is a common conversation between black parents and their children, long known as \u201cthe talk\u201d. It is about what to do when approached by a police officer.</p> \n<p>How to talk. How to act. How, simply, to survive.</p> \n<p>In recent years, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/08/the-counted-police-killings-2016-young-black-men\">high-profile killings</a> of black men and boys have brought \u201cthe talk\u201d to national attention. It has become part of discussion of the inequalities of race, of the problem of police brutality itself.</p> \n<p>For most black families, \u201cthe talk\u201d is a choice, a just-in-case, a part of raising children. When explaining what can go wrong, there are too many examples to use.</p> \n<p>They may discuss what happened to a young man who visited a convenience store and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/30/trayvon-martin-ramarley-graham-bronx-teenager\">then made his way home</a> in New York.

She had just picked him up from elementary school. The conversation was stopped by a banging on the door.</p> \n<p>Cops.</p> \n<p>They had started following Ramarley just a few minutes before, around 3pm on 2 February 2012, when he left a bodega on White Plains Road and East 228th Street and began to make his way home. CCTV footage shows he seemed unaware that police were scrambling behind him. A couple of minutes later, the same footage shows, police ran up to the apartment block into which Ramarley had walked. They banged on the back door until someone let them in. They raced to the second floor, up the narrow stairs.</p> \n<p>Chinnor heard their shouts, their commands. Ramarley turned and walked toward the noise, just a few feet. The boys\u2019 slight, petite grandmother followed shielding Ramarley even though he towered over her.</p> \n<p>The officers slammed into the apartment. Between screams, a single shot rang out. Chinnor leaned away from the wall, peering toward the bathroom. He could see his brother\u2019s feet, splayed out into the hallway.</p> \n<p>Ramarley Graham was dead.</p> \n<p>Richard Haste, the officer who fired the shot, said he thought the teen might have had a gun. He did not. The only guns were in the hands of the officers.</p> \n<p>Chinnor watched as officers took his grandmother down to the police station. They kept her there seven hours.</p> \n<p>Removed from the apartment, the six-year-old stood in the cold dusk, wearing only a shirt and his underwear, his brother dead on the floor. Officers walked him downstairs, where a neighbor said he would watch him. Chinnor was in a first-floor apartment when his mother, Constance Malcolm, came home. The neighbor had called her and said there were police in the backyard, but stopped short of breaking the news. Constance found out at the station.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"Article break\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">Article break</a> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>In the months after Ramarley\u2019s death</strong>, Constance organized 18 marches, one for each year of her son\u2019s life. Chinnor, still in first grade, marched with her. They kept Ramarley in the public eye, his death in public discussion. In contrast, Constance says, in the months and years since, the boys\u2019 grandmother has refused to discuss the few minutes that uprooted their lives. Nor have Chinnor and his mother talked at any length about what happens after a loved one is killed by police.</p> \n<p>In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, Constance says, she was not able to identify her son for four days. Somehow, his body had been misnamed. When she went to identify him, at the morgue, there was no Ramarley Graham. For four days, it was as if he didn\u2019t exist. The son who loved watching Animal Planet, who asked for a pet monkey to raise in the heart of the Bronx. The grandson who loved his grandmother\u2019s Jamaican stewed peas. The brother who showed Chinnor how to lift weights, even though he was six, the favorite video game partner, sometimes his after-school escort home. He was gone, but his body was nowhere to be found.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"41be5773-ceb2-45f9-96ce-b2503dec8ab2\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pybao_yv6jU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Even now, she says, Chinnor is too young to sit down for the talk. He\u2019s only 13, just a year older than Tamir Rice was when he was killed in Cleveland in 2014. But she doesn\u2019t avoid the subject. Chinnor goes with her to hear experts speak about officer-involved shootings, about how to cope with grief, about how to survive in America as a black man. Such public talks are common. Once, she took Chinnor to a class that aimed to tell young black men what to do when stopped on the street or pulled over when driving a car.</p> \n<p>She lets the experts talk because, she says, she is not only a mother. She is still a grieving woman and she is working two jobs, seeking to keep her mind off what happened seven years ago.</p> \n<p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she says, \u201cif the talk comes from somebody else he will understand. [Rather than] me telling him, as a woman, you know?\u201d</p> \n<p>When she does speak about the police in front of Chinnor, she\u2019s careful. When Ramarley was shot, his older sister was training to become an officer.</p> \n<p>\u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d she says, \u201cnobody wants to go out and don\u2019t come back in.

The New York police department (NYPD) claimed the officers who followed Ramarley thought he had a gun because they had watched him adjust his waistband as he left the bodega. But as the media reported and police investigated, it became clear the officer who shot Ramarley had not had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/30/trayvon-martin-ramarley-graham-bronx-teenager\">the training</a> required for the narcotics enforcement unit to which he was assigned.</p> \n<p>Manslaughter charges were dropped, a judge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/15/nypd-officer-teenager-bronx-ramarley-graham\">saying</a> the Bronx district attorney\u2019s office had failed to properly instruct members of a grand jury. A second grand jury failed to bring an indictment.</p> \n<p>But on the first anniversary of Ramarley\u2019s death, the family <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/03/ramarley-graham-family-sues-nypd-anniversary\">sued</a>, accusing the NYPD of improperly training its officers, disproportionately targeting minority youth through controversial stop-and-frisk practices and a cover-up surrounding the death. The city <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/03/ramarley-graham-family-police-reform-nypd\">settled for $3.9m</a>. Chinnor received $500,000.</p> \n<p>In 2017, Haste faced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/27/nypd-richard-haste-resigns-ramarley-graham\">disciplinary action</a>, on NYPD charges including \u201cpoor judgement\u201d. To avoid being fired, he resigned. Constance left the legal fight there.</p> \n<p>She decided to give her son a chance to move on. In their new home, Chinnor has his own room in the back. She wants him to be comfortable, to have his own space and to start over fresh. </p> \n<p>Chinnor doesn\u2019t really go anywhere except school, his mother says, because she doesn\u2019t allow him out on his own.</p> \n<p>He\u2019s still a kid, after all. In the hours after his brother\u2019s death, she says, when he finally saw her, Chinnor ran to her and told her all he had seen. How, she asks, could he grasp all that at six? Now, seven years on, leaning into the kitchen island, the 13-year-old freezes when, in his retelling, he reaches the moments after his brother fell to the ground. He can\u2019t get through it. He goes back to his room to play video games. He plays a lot on weekends, especially when his mom takes on extra shifts at the nursing home.</p> \n<p>Sometimes, Chinnor says, he sneaks back to his old neighborhood to see friends, something his mom doesn\u2019t like him to do. He glances over at his mother, offering a mischievous half-smile. Ramarley used to defend him when Constance was angry, he says.</p> \n<p>But most days after school he chooses to stay in his room. It is painted a shade of blue between royal and cornflower and the only thing on the wall is directly next to his bed: a collage about his brother.</p> \n<p>Unlike most children his age, he has a silent confidence. He sits through the conversations his mother has about his older brother, rarely speaking, always listening. </p> \n<p>Constance wants her son to enjoy being a child. But she does finally admit that soon it will be time to have the talk, to sit down and, once and for all, talk about the police and what to do when they stop him.</p> \n<p>She\u2019ll tell him: \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t want you to react a certain way. Just stay calm, keep your eye on that badge. You need that number. No matter, if you don\u2019t remember anything else, make sure you remember that badge number, because that is what is going to identify that person that did whatever they did to you.\u201d</p> \n<p>She pauses.</p> \n<p>\u201cYeah. So that\u2019s just how we deal with it right now.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"Article break\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">Article break</a> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>The </strong><strong>father</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"edad7aef1f07d693cc4b8c32b6b4b5d80efac2e1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/edad7aef1f07d693cc4b8c32b6b4b5d80efac2e1/177_0_5625_3376/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joey and Leanna Crutcher.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joey and Leanna Crutcher.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Khushbu Shah/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In Tulsa, Oklahoma, Tykiaha Crutcher points out dresses she would like to try on for her prom.

He had left the vehicle, which witnesses said he said he thought was about to \u201cblow up\u201d. The officers approached him as a helicopter filmed from above.</p> \n<p> One officer used a Taser. The other, Betty Shelby, shot Terence. She killed him. The helicopter footage zooms in, showing Terence on the ground.</p> \n<p>Shelby\u2019s attorney later said the officer claimed that Terence\u2019s behavior was erratic and he did not comply with commands. Local news <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/21/terence-crutcher-police-shooting-tulsa-activists-anger\">outlets</a> reported that police said a vial of PCP, a hallucinogen, was found in the vehicle. The Crutcher family and their supporters say that was used to deflect attention from the officers\u2019 conduct.</p> \n<p>That night, Tykiaha was celebrating an away win for the Central high football team when one of her aunts called, asking if her daddy was OK. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she asked. Her aunt asked again. Yeah, she told her, he\u2019s going to Tyjunae\u2019s birthday party.</p> \n<p>No, her aunt said.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe was shot by a police officer.\u201d</p> \n<p>In shock, Tykiaha got on to the school bus, surrounded by classmates. Once she got back to campus, she called JoJo, then her grandmother, then her sisters. No one picked up. She can\u2019t remember who finally answered. Whoever it was said her father was dead.</p> \n<p>Only after the funeral did Tykiaha go back to school. When she did, the football team dedicated a game and a pep rally to her. Classmates asked if she was OK. She told them she didn\u2019t know.</p> \n<p>Her friends kept showing up to rallies, marches and galas, all in Terence\u2019s name. On the biggest march, her aunt Tiffany says, some held a banner at the front of the crowd. When Imani, Tykiaha\u2019s older half-sister, went back to school, some students organized a walkout, protesting her father\u2019s death. One teacher let everyone skip class and talk through their concerns around policing and growing up black.</p> \n<p>Years ago, JoJo took the same approach with his own son \u2013 Terence. He wanted to make sure he and others in north Tulsa, a predominantly black neighborhood, understood what it was to be stopped by police.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe talked about this all of the time because black boys was always [being stopped], young black males,\u201d JoJo says, in front of his grandchildren, in his split-level living room.

He edges his way towards his grandfather, finding a spot under the coffee table.</p> \n<p>\u201cAfrican Americans was always the subject of police stops,\u201d JoJo says. \u201cWe know what the disparity is, and I would say: \u2018Well one thing you do to protect yourself if they tell you to stop, do that.\u2019 Well, Terence didn\u2019t do that. But anyway, Terence had bad hearing so he couldn\u2019t really hear \u2026\u201d</p> \n<p>Tykiaha interrupts. Her father couldn\u2019t hear, she says. He also had one fake eye.</p> \n<p>JoJo continues. \u201cBut what Terence was doing, he was doing what I had taught him to do. He had his hands up in the air.\u201d</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/20/tulsa-shooting-helicopter-footage-shows-victim-unarmed-and-walking-away-video\">Video</a> from the helicopter does indeed show Terence with his hands up.

Sometimes, she was homeless. Other times, she lived with men she met. On rare occasions she lived with family or friends. She sold drugs. She spent time in jail.</p> \n<p>\u201cI done been arrested so many times,\u201d she says. \u201cI mean, I ain\u2019t trying brag about it, but I\u2019ve done been in jail so many times in Cleveland, growing up as a juvenile.\u201d</p> \n<p>Her children would live different lives, she thought, as the four kids grew up. Before she had her oldest, Christmas and Thanksgiving were depressing, spent alone. But after Tasheona was born, in 1995, she \u201ctried to be right about it\u201d, giving her children holidays surrounded by her cousins, sometimes their grandfather, too.</p> \n<p>The kids would all graduate high school, Samaria promised herself. Tasheona, Tavon and Tajai did. But Samaria will never know for certain if Tamir, her youngest, the 12-year-old she calls her baby, would have graduated, too.</p> \n<p>She remembers a child who was months away from being a teenager but still let his mother kiss and hug him. His favorite foods were like any other child\u2019s: cheese pizza, ice cream, macaroni and cheese, fries. He was an \u201call-American kid, you know?\u201d</p> \n<p>Tamir was bright, helpful and caring. When younger children needed help tying their shoes or getting their backpacks on, the sixth grader would help. </p> \n<p>Most days, she didn\u2019t let him past the porch. But on 22 November 2014, a Saturday afternoon, she let him walk down the street with Tajai, to the Mega Convenient Food Mart for chips and juice, then to the playground across the street. A friend had let Tamir borrow his pellet gun, from which the orange tip that signified it was a toy had been removed.</p> \n<p>Tamir played with the gun outside the recreational center, two blocks away from his porch. Someone called 911, mentioning the gun was \u201cprobably fake\u201d and the person holding it \u201cwas probably a juvenile\u201d. That information was not relayed to Timothy Loehmann, a 26-year-old rookie police officer, and his partner, Frank Garmback.</p> \n<p>Samaria has watched the surveillance video, of course. It shows that a police vehicle jumped a curb and went over a grassy hill, bypassing two driveways. Police say the car slid 40ft in the grass because the ground was wet. It pulled up near Tamir, who was sitting on a gazebo.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhy would you jump that curb, go over the hill, almost knock the swing set down, and [slide] across there like you\u2019re a cowboy, and murder my son?\u201d Samaria asks.</p> \n<p>Two seconds after jumping out of the car, Loehmann shot Tamir.</p> \n<p>Tajai ran towards her brother. He had been shot in the abdomen. A witness heard her scream: \u201cThat\u2019s my brother.\u201d An off-duty officer working security grabbed her, took her down, handcuffed her and put her in the backseat of the police car, because she \u201cwould not calm down\u201d.</p> \n<p>All the law enforcement officers <a href=\"http://prosecutor.cuyahogacounty.us/pdf_prosecutor/en-US/Rice%20Case%20Report%20FINAL%20FINAL%2012-28a.pdf\">at the scene</a> agreed that Tamir was a black male who looked older and bigger than his age.</p> \n<p>The neighbor who had been with Tamir ran over to find Samaria. She ran two blocks, saw her daughter handcuffed in the back of a police car. She saw her son. She demanded to get in the ambulance with him. Seventeen minutes later, the ambulance left the parking lot.</p> \n<p>The next day, her son died.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"Article break\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">Article break</a> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>In October 2018</strong>, Tajai was working on a music video for <a href=\"http://www.shootingwithoutbullets.org/\">Shooting without Bullets</a>, a not-for-profit, with Amanda King, Samaria\u2019s assistant.

They\u2019re doing the best they can, she says. Before Tamir\u2019s death, she hadn\u2019t thought to talk to any of her children about police officers, about what to do when confronted by them, and about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/31/the-counted-police-killings-2015-young-black-men\">deaths of so many black men</a> in America.</p> \n<p>In all her run-ins with officers, she says, they never put hands upon her. When she became a mother, she says, she simply tried to raise her kids the best she could. Until Tamir\u2019s death, she lived in a bubble.</p> \n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even pay it no attention,\u201d she says. \u201cI did not even know what was going on.\u201d</p> \n<p>Now she knows only too well. Her kids, she says, have not come close to healing. \u201cThey are never going to be able to get over their brother\u2019s death,\u201d Samaria says. So how can she talk to them about injustice, race and inequality? Right now, Samaria notices, \u201c[T]hey are very effective [in] making bad decisions and choices out of life. So that\u2019s how they\u2019re dealing.\u201d</p> \n<p>She\u2019s upset that Tasheona, 23, has two children already. As we speak, Tajai is pregnant, too.</p> \n<p>\u201cHow you normal when your brother\u2019s face is all over the TV and your friends see it?\u201d</p> \n<p>She has stopped trying to convince her children they need help.</p> \n<p>Like any mother, Samaria worries about her children. But she says she\u2019s not speaking to them right now. They have left her no choice, she says.</p> \n<p>In 2016, the family and the city of Cleveland <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/04/cleveland-police-tamir-rice-killing\">reached</a> a $6m settlement. Tajai received the most, her mother says, because of what she saw. Tajai and Tamir were like two peas in a pod, she says. Two years ago, for her 40th birthday, Christmas Eve, she got the kids together. Tajai cried, saying: \u201cI miss my brother, I miss my brother, I miss my brother.\u201d Samaria wanted her to go to counseling, to start dealing with the loss. But, she says, she hasn\u2019t gone yet.</p> \n<p>Instead, Samaria focuses on kids in the community. She bought a rundown building and renamed it: the Tamir Rice Cultural Center. Right now it\u2019s empty. She wants it to offer civics classes. But if she has to, she will use the center to talk.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf the police officer asks your name,\u201d she\u2019ll tell the local kids, \u201cyou give them your name.

      "bodyText": "In America, there is a common conversation between black parents and their children, long known as \u201cthe talk\u201d. It is about what to do when approached by a police officer. How to talk. How to act. How, simply, to survive. In recent years, high-profile killings of black men and boys have brought \u201cthe talk\u201d to national attention. It has become part of discussion of the inequalities of race, of the problem of police brutality itself. For most black families, \u201cthe talk\u201d is a choice, a just-in-case, a part of raising children. When explaining what can go wrong, there are too many examples to use. They may discuss what happened to a young man who visited a convenience store and then made his way home in New York. They may discuss what happened to a 12-year-old boy who played with a pellet gun in a park in Cleveland. They may discuss what happened to a 40-year-old man who stopped his car on a public road in Tulsa. Others discuss those cases each day. They are the women, men and children who lived with the dead, who raised them, who called them brother or father or son. In New York, Ohio and Oklahoma, the Guardian spoke to those families. For them, \u201cthe talk\u201d does not define one moment in their lives. It is the definition of everything after. They are the families left behind. The brother Chinnor Campbell cowered in the living room, hiding behind the white wall that separated the space from the narrow hallway. Ramarley Graham, his 18-year-old half-brother, had walked through the front door of the apartment in the Bronx, New York, a couple of minutes before, as the six-year-old was changing his clothes and talking to their grandmother. She had just picked him up from elementary school. The conversation was stopped by a banging on the door. Cops. They had started following Ramarley just a few minutes before, around 3pm on 2 February 2012, when he left a bodega on White Plains Road and East 228th Street and began to make his way home. CCTV footage shows he seemed unaware that police were scrambling behind him. A couple of minutes later, the same footage shows, police ran up to the apartment block into which Ramarley had walked. They banged on the back door until someone let them in. They raced to the second floor, up the narrow stairs. Chinnor heard their shouts, their commands. Ramarley turned and walked toward the noise, just a few feet. The boys\u2019 slight, petite grandmother followed shielding Ramarley even though he towered over her. The officers slammed into the apartment. Between screams, a single shot rang out. Chinnor leaned away from the wall, peering toward the bathroom. He could see his brother\u2019s feet, splayed out into the hallway. Ramarley Graham was dead. Richard Haste, the officer who fired the shot, said he thought the teen might have had a gun. He did not. The only guns were in the hands of the officers. Chinnor watched as officers took his grandmother down to the police station. They kept her there seven hours. Removed from the apartment, the six-year-old stood in the cold dusk, wearing only a shirt and his underwear, his brother dead on the floor. Officers walked him downstairs, where a neighbor said he would watch him. Chinnor was in a first-floor apartment when his mother, Constance Malcolm, came home. The neighbor had called her and said there were police in the backyard, but stopped short of breaking the news. Constance found out at the station. In the months after Ramarley\u2019s death, Constance organized 18 marches, one for each year of her son\u2019s life. Chinnor, still in first grade, marched with her. They kept Ramarley in the public eye, his death in public discussion. In contrast, Constance says, in the months and years since, the boys\u2019 grandmother has refused to discuss the few minutes that uprooted their lives. Nor have Chinnor and his mother talked at any length about what happens after a loved one is killed by police. In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, Constance says, she was not able to identify her son for four days. Somehow, his body had been misnamed. When she went to identify him, at the morgue, there was no Ramarley Graham. For four days, it was as if he didn\u2019t exist. The son who loved watching Animal Planet, who asked for a pet monkey to raise in the heart of the Bronx. The grandson who loved his grandmother\u2019s Jamaican stewed peas. The brother who showed Chinnor how to lift weights, even though he was six, the favorite video game partner, sometimes his after-school escort home. He was gone, but his body was nowhere to be found. Even now, she says, Chinnor is too young to sit down for the talk. He\u2019s only 13, just a year older than Tamir Rice was when he was killed in Cleveland in 2014. But she doesn\u2019t avoid the subject. Chinnor goes with her to hear experts speak about officer-involved shootings, about how to cope with grief, about how to survive in America as a black man. Such public talks are common. Once, she took Chinnor to a class that aimed to tell young black men what to do when stopped on the street or pulled over when driving a car. She lets the experts talk because, she says, she is not only a mother. She is still a grieving woman and she is working two jobs, seeking to keep her mind off what happened seven years ago. \u201cMaybe,\u201d she says, \u201cif the talk comes from somebody else he will understand. [Rather than] me telling him, as a woman, you know?\u201d When she does speak about the police in front of Chinnor, she\u2019s careful. When Ramarley was shot, his older sister was training to become an officer. \u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d she says, \u201cnobody wants to go out and don\u2019t come back in. Even the police officers, they want to go out and go back home.\u201d She wants her son to come home. Constance and Chinnor are having \u201cthe talk\u201d every single day, in other ways, often without saying a word. In a new home in a different neighborhood, on a quieter street in the Bronx, Constance shifts on her stool. Only a handful of pictures \u2013 mostly of her children \u2013 hang on the walls around her. Nearly two years ago, she moved Chinnor and her mother out of the old apartment. It had taken a few years to realize they were both traumatized. Both had walked through an apartment where memories stuck to the walls. After all, Constance thought, she herself is traumatized from thinking of her son being shot in his own home and she wasn\u2019t there to see it. Because of the shooting, the move to a new home was possible. The New York police department (NYPD) claimed the officers who followed Ramarley thought he had a gun because they had watched him adjust his waistband as he left the bodega. But as the media reported and police investigated, it became clear the officer who shot Ramarley had not had the training required for the narcotics enforcement unit to which he was assigned. Manslaughter charges were dropped, a judge saying the Bronx district attorney\u2019s office had failed to properly instruct members of a grand jury. A second grand jury failed to bring an indictment. But on the first anniversary of Ramarley\u2019s death, the family sued, accusing the NYPD of improperly training its officers, disproportionately targeting minority youth through controversial stop-and-frisk practices and a cover-up surrounding the death. The city settled for $3.9m. Chinnor received $500,000. In 2017, Haste faced disciplinary action, on NYPD charges including \u201cpoor judgement\u201d. To avoid being fired, he resigned. Constance left the legal fight there. She decided to give her son a chance to move on. In their new home, Chinnor has his own room in the back. She wants him to be comfortable, to have his own space and to start over fresh. Chinnor doesn\u2019t really go anywhere except school, his mother says, because she doesn\u2019t allow him out on his own. He\u2019s still a kid, after all. In the hours after his brother\u2019s death, she says, when he finally saw her, Chinnor ran to her and told her all he had seen. How, she asks, could he grasp all that at six? Now, seven years on, leaning into the kitchen island, the 13-year-old freezes when, in his retelling, he reaches the moments after his brother fell to the ground. He can\u2019t get through it. He goes back to his room to play video games. He plays a lot on weekends, especially when his mom takes on extra shifts at the nursing home. Sometimes, Chinnor says, he sneaks back to his old neighborhood to see friends, something his mom doesn\u2019t like him to do. He glances over at his mother, offering a mischievous half-smile. Ramarley used to defend him when Constance was angry, he says. But most days after school he chooses to stay in his room. It is painted a shade of blue between royal and cornflower and the only thing on the wall is directly next to his bed: a collage about his brother. Unlike most children his age, he has a silent confidence. He sits through the conversations his mother has about his older brother, rarely speaking, always listening. Constance wants her son to enjoy being a child. But she does finally admit that soon it will be time to have the talk, to sit down and, once and for all, talk about the police and what to do when they stop him. She\u2019ll tell him: \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t want you to react a certain way. Just stay calm, keep your eye on that badge. You need that number. No matter, if you don\u2019t remember anything else, make sure you remember that badge number, because that is what is going to identify that person that did whatever they did to you.\u201d She pauses. \u201cYeah. So that\u2019s just how we deal with it right now.\u201d The father In Tulsa, Oklahoma, Tykiaha Crutcher points out dresses she would like to try on for her prom. The ones she likes sparkle. Her grandparents, Joey and Leanna, are seated on the other side of a table set for seven, smiling at their four grandchildren. Joey, whose grandkids call him JoJo, pushes his rice and beans around his plate. He\u2019s not interested in eating. For the 920 days before this one, he has felt the same. If Tykiaha\u2019s father, Terence, were still alive, he would have helped pick out her dress. Well, she says, he would have made sure he liked it and it wasn\u2019t showing too much. Instead, Terence\u2019s twin sister, Tiffany, will take Tykiaha and her two sisters shopping. On the night of 16 September 2016, Terence Crutcher was meant to go to a music appreciation class at community college. When it was cancelled, he made his way to Friday night choir practice, where his father was waiting. After that, he was supposed to go to a birthday party for Tykiaha\u2019s younger sister Tyjunae. He never made it. Responding to a 911 call, officers were sent to a road in Tulsa on which Terence had stopped his car. He had left the vehicle, which witnesses said he said he thought was about to \u201cblow up\u201d. The officers approached him as a helicopter filmed from above. One officer used a Taser. The other, Betty Shelby, shot Terence. She killed him. The helicopter footage zooms in, showing Terence on the ground. Shelby\u2019s attorney later said the officer claimed that Terence\u2019s behavior was erratic and he did not comply with commands. Local news outlets reported that police said a vial of PCP, a hallucinogen, was found in the vehicle. The Crutcher family and their supporters say that was used to deflect attention from the officers\u2019 conduct. That night, Tykiaha was celebrating an away win for the Central high football team when one of her aunts called, asking if her daddy was OK. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she asked. Her aunt asked again. Yeah, she told her, he\u2019s going to Tyjunae\u2019s birthday party. No, her aunt said. \u201cHe was shot by a police officer.\u201d In shock, Tykiaha got on to the school bus, surrounded by classmates. Once she got back to campus, she called JoJo, then her grandmother, then her sisters. No one picked up. She can\u2019t remember who finally answered. Whoever it was said her father was dead. Only after the funeral did Tykiaha go back to school. When she did, the football team dedicated a game and a pep rally to her. Classmates asked if she was OK. She told them she didn\u2019t know. Her friends kept showing up to rallies, marches and galas, all in Terence\u2019s name. On the biggest march, her aunt Tiffany says, some held a banner at the front of the crowd. When Imani, Tykiaha\u2019s older half-sister, went back to school, some students organized a walkout, protesting her father\u2019s death. One teacher let everyone skip class and talk through their concerns around policing and growing up black. Years ago, JoJo took the same approach with his own son \u2013 Terence. He wanted to make sure he and others in north Tulsa, a predominantly black neighborhood, understood what it was to be stopped by police. \u201cWe talked about this all of the time because black boys was always [being stopped], young black males,\u201d JoJo says, in front of his grandchildren, in his split-level living room. Terence Jr is lying upside down on the brown carpeted stairs, playing video games. He edges his way towards his grandfather, finding a spot under the coffee table. \u201cAfrican Americans was always the subject of police stops,\u201d JoJo says. \u201cWe know what the disparity is, and I would say: \u2018Well one thing you do to protect yourself if they tell you to stop, do that.\u2019 Well, Terence didn\u2019t do that. But anyway, Terence had bad hearing so he couldn\u2019t really hear \u2026\u201d Tykiaha interrupts. Her father couldn\u2019t hear, she says. He also had one fake eye. JoJo continues. \u201cBut what Terence was doing, he was doing what I had taught him to do. He had his hands up in the air.\u201d Video from the helicopter does indeed show Terence with his hands up. Police say he nonetheless did not follow directions. Terence Jr\u2019s sister and half-sisters \u2013 Imani, Tykiaha and Tyjunae \u2013 are still teenagers. In the days after their father\u2019s death, Imani says, the three girls sat together, discussing how they would keep the killing from their four-year-old brother. One day, tired after mornings of crying, their heads pounding, they were taking a rest when Terence came looking for Tykiaha. \u201cKaka,\u201d he said, \u201csome white lady killed my daddy.\u201d Why, he asked. \u201cOh my God,\u201d she thought. Tykiaha didn\u2019t know how to respond. The child had overheard relatives as they prepared for the funeral. \u201cWe don\u2019t know, Terence,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s a bad person.\u201d She cried again that night. Two and a half years later, Terence Jr is only seven. But the ones looking out for him, especially Aunt Tiffany, think it is time to have the talk. \u201cTerence,\u201d Tiffany asks, \u201cwhat did I tell you the other day about the police if you didn\u2019t listen the first time? Tykiaha repeats the question and asks: \u201cWhat did Tiffany tell you, Terence?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t remember,\u201d he answers, shifting to a baby voice. Tiffany stresses the importance of repetition in teaching Terence Jr how to navigate an unjust world. The boy interrupts her. \u201cDon\u2019t disobey,\u201d he says, suddenly. His grandfather cheers. The morning after his son was shot, JoJo showed up at church. There was a young men\u2019s conference. He stayed, to be there for his community. \u201cI wish I had a dad,\u201d Imani says, \u201cbut JoJo, he steps in every time.\u201d She\u2019s speaking in a living room that serves mostly as a homage to her father. Terence smiles from one wall, surrounded by pictures of his children. Artwork by supporters and activists is framed in a reading nook. \u201cGrandpa always tell me it\u2019s OK to cry about it,\u201d says Tyjunae, 14, the youngest of the girls. He told her she may just need to draw about her father\u2019s death, or pray about it. The elders in the family act as father, mother, an entire support system. When Tiffany is in town, between meetings with the family lawyer, doctor\u2019s appointments and conversations with activists, she takes Terence Jr to a play center. The grandparents keep an eye on college applications and new boyfriends, describe dance classes and yearbook committees. But each day since Terence was shot has been part of a conversation about injustice and race. No one shies away from the uncomfortable facts of living in Tulsa as one of the Crutchers. \u201cIt does become a full-time job,\u201d Tiffany admits. \u201cIt just becomes your lifestyle, pursuing justice and wanting better for the community. It just becomes a part of your DNA.\u201d What made her angry, she says, was that police, Tulsa residents and the media called her twin brother a suspect, a subject, a thug. \u201cThat was their daddy,\u201d she says, nodding over to the girls lined up on the sofa. \u201cThat was their son,\u201d she says, looking at her parents. \u201cHe was a man,\u201d she says, her voice rising. \u201cHis car stalled. Whatever was going on with him mentally, he needed help. He needed help and you killed him.\u201d Terence Jr struggles to hold on to memories of his father. He likes to say his favorite color is blue, because his daddy\u2019s favorite color was blue. This year, unprompted, he asked his school if he could profile his father for Black History Month. His teacher called Tiffany in for a chat, tried to convince Terence Jr to profile someone else. Maybe Barack Obama? But Terence Jr insisted. \u201cThat\u2019s my dad,\u201d he says, pulling his project from his play area in the corner of the living room. A picture falls off the board. Terence Jr, in his father\u2019s lap. \u201cHe got shot,\u201d he says. The mother When she had Tamir, on 25 June 2002, Samaria Rice was living in a shelter in Cleveland. She had spent her life on the streets since she was 12, after her mother went to prison, when her father kicked her out. Sometimes, she was homeless. Other times, she lived with men she met. On rare occasions she lived with family or friends. She sold drugs. She spent time in jail. \u201cI done been arrested so many times,\u201d she says. \u201cI mean, I ain\u2019t trying brag about it, but I\u2019ve done been in jail so many times in Cleveland, growing up as a juvenile.\u201d Her children would live different lives, she thought, as the four kids grew up. Before she had her oldest, Christmas and Thanksgiving were depressing, spent alone. But after Tasheona was born, in 1995, she \u201ctried to be right about it\u201d, giving her children holidays surrounded by her cousins, sometimes their grandfather, too. The kids would all graduate high school, Samaria promised herself. Tasheona, Tavon and Tajai did. But Samaria will never know for certain if Tamir, her youngest, the 12-year-old she calls her baby, would have graduated, too. She remembers a child who was months away from being a teenager but still let his mother kiss and hug him. His favorite foods were like any other child\u2019s: cheese pizza, ice cream, macaroni and cheese, fries. He was an \u201call-American kid, you know?\u201d Tamir was bright, helpful and caring. When younger children needed help tying their shoes or getting their backpacks on, the sixth grader would help. Most days, she didn\u2019t let him past the porch. But on 22 November 2014, a Saturday afternoon, she let him walk down the street with Tajai, to the Mega Convenient Food Mart for chips and juice, then to the playground across the street. A friend had let Tamir borrow his pellet gun, from which the orange tip that signified it was a toy had been removed. Tamir played with the gun outside the recreational center, two blocks away from his porch. Someone called 911, mentioning the gun was \u201cprobably fake\u201d and the person holding it \u201cwas probably a juvenile\u201d. That information was not relayed to Timothy Loehmann, a 26-year-old rookie police officer, and his partner, Frank Garmback. Samaria has watched the surveillance video, of course. It shows that a police vehicle jumped a curb and went over a grassy hill, bypassing two driveways. Police say the car slid 40ft in the grass because the ground was wet. It pulled up near Tamir, who was sitting on a gazebo. \u201cWhy would you jump that curb, go over the hill, almost knock the swing set down, and [slide] across there like you\u2019re a cowboy, and murder my son?\u201d Samaria asks. Two seconds after jumping out of the car, Loehmann shot Tamir. Tajai ran towards her brother. He had been shot in the abdomen. A witness heard her scream: \u201cThat\u2019s my brother.\u201d An off-duty officer working security grabbed her, took her down, handcuffed her and put her in the backseat of the police car, because she \u201cwould not calm down\u201d. All the law enforcement officers at the scene agreed that Tamir was a black male who looked older and bigger than his age. The neighbor who had been with Tamir ran over to find Samaria. She ran two blocks, saw her daughter handcuffed in the back of a police car. She saw her son. She demanded to get in the ambulance with him. Seventeen minutes later, the ambulance left the parking lot. The next day, her son died. In October 2018, Tajai was working on a music video for Shooting without Bullets, a not-for-profit, with Amanda King, Samaria\u2019s assistant. She was dancing, just hanging out with her friends. Then her sister called, to tell her Loehmann was going to be rehired as a police officer in Bellaire, Ohio. King remembers Tajai screaming: \u201cI hate him, I hate him! I want him to die!\u201d Then she collapsed. In the years since their brother was killed, Samaria has had a hard time talking to her children. They\u2019re doing the best they can, she says. Before Tamir\u2019s death, she hadn\u2019t thought to talk to any of her children about police officers, about what to do when confronted by them, and about the deaths of so many black men in America. In all her run-ins with officers, she says, they never put hands upon her. When she became a mother, she says, she simply tried to raise her kids the best she could. Until Tamir\u2019s death, she lived in a bubble. \u201cI didn\u2019t even pay it no attention,\u201d she says. \u201cI did not even know what was going on.\u201d Now she knows only too well. Her kids, she says, have not come close to healing. \u201cThey are never going to be able to get over their brother\u2019s death,\u201d Samaria says. So how can she talk to them about injustice, race and inequality? Right now, Samaria notices, \u201c[T]hey are very effective [in] making bad decisions and choices out of life. So that\u2019s how they\u2019re dealing.\u201d She\u2019s upset that Tasheona, 23, has two children already. As we speak, Tajai is pregnant, too. \u201cHow you normal when your brother\u2019s face is all over the TV and your friends see it?\u201d She has stopped trying to convince her children they need help. Like any mother, Samaria worries about her children. But she says she\u2019s not speaking to them right now. They have left her no choice, she says. In 2016, the family and the city of Cleveland reached a $6m settlement. Tajai received the most, her mother says, because of what she saw. Tajai and Tamir were like two peas in a pod, she says. Two years ago, for her 40th birthday, Christmas Eve, she got the kids together. Tajai cried, saying: \u201cI miss my brother, I miss my brother, I miss my brother.\u201d Samaria wanted her to go to counseling, to start dealing with the loss. But, she says, she hasn\u2019t gone yet. Instead, Samaria focuses on kids in the community. She bought a rundown building and renamed it: the Tamir Rice Cultural Center. Right now it\u2019s empty. She wants it to offer civics classes. But if she has to, she will use the center to talk. \u201cIf the police officer asks your name,\u201d she\u2019ll tell the local kids, \u201cyou give them your name. You have to identify and tell them you don\u2019t have to speak to them unless a lawyer is present. She also wants to develop a Tamir Rice safety guide, for parents to read to their children. What to do when your child is arrested or simply approached. \u201cI wasn\u2019t no activist,\u201d she says. \u201cNone of these families were. All of them have been forced to take on a job they wouldn\u2019t wish upon anyone else.\u201d But now that\u2019s what she is, an activist, whether she likes it or not. She wants, she says, to \u201ctell these babies the truth because they\u2019re our future. At the park where Tamir was shot, Samaria stands where the gazebo used to be. She had it removed and is looking to have it bronzed, to have it stand as a memorial to her son. \u201cIf he had been white I believe it coulda turned out a different type of way,\u201d she says of her son. \u201cMaybe. I\u2019m sure of it. I think about that all the time. Every time I hear about somebody getting killed by the police or even community violence, it tears on me. It weighs on me because I\u2019m thinking that Tamir should\u2019ve been enough. That should\u2019ve been enough. Why are people still dying after my son by the police? \u201cI should be planning his prom. Helping him learn how to get his work permit, or his driver\u2019s license. But, this is what I\u2019ve been doing for the last four years.\u201d After Tamir was killed, Samaria got a tattoo on her hand. It is Proverbs 22:6: \u201cStart children off on the way they should go, and even when they are old they will not turn from it.\u201d It ran in his obituary.",

Marks out of 10? 8. Would you meet again? We are looking to have another night out. \u2022 Jason and Tanya ate at Gezellig London WC1. Fancy a blind date? Email blind.date@theguardian.com.

It cost me nothing and I didn\u2019t even need my car, so it was zero bother. But I looked like a massive hero. And I got some lovely sunflowers.</p> <p>I should add that my friend is the former wife of my partner, James. She\u2019s \u201cthe ex\u201d, the mother of his 14-year-old son and nine-year-old daughter. She\u2019s the woman he married and wanted to be with for ever. Her name is Emily.

I don\u2019t want to be \u201cDaddy\u2019s girlfriend\u201d, I want to be a legitimate part of this family.</p> <p>And family means Emily, too. </p> <p>James and I met in March 2016 \u2013 less than two months after his separation from Emily following seven years of marriage. What started as a \u201cTinder special\u201d unexpectedly became a serious relationship. In early 2018, I moved in with James; he and Emily had sold their house and bought separately. Emily\u2019s house is about 10 minutes\u2019 walk away, and the children spend 50% of their time in each house. It\u2019s scrupulously fair (there\u2019s a spreadsheet and everything). But it hasn\u2019t always been like the blended Brady Bunch.</p> <p>\u201cThe introduction of another woman taking a \u2018mum\u2019 role with my kids hit very suddenly,\u201d Emily told me. \u201cI\u2019d heard that this person had come and had dinner with my kids and read them bedtime stories. It was the stories that smarted most. Bedtime is a private, personal time. It felt like a stranger had stepped into a very intimate space uninvited.\u201d</p> <p>I was introduced to the children with no great ceremony and we all sat in the kitchen eating pasta \u2013 simple. But Emily\u2019s right. What started as dinner leaked into bedtime and I was carried along into teeth brushing and a chapter of Harry Potter. I thought it was fine \u2013 but I wasn\u2019t a parent then.</p> <p>The advice I could find online made it sound like becoming a step-parent was something that occurred overnight. Like the children woke up one morning to find me flipping pancakes in the kitchen. Really it\u2019s more like a slow fade. You start as Daddy\u2019s new friend, slide into being a girlfriend, and finally tip into living together, staring at wet towels on the floor and wondering how you went so quickly from gin and tonic to fish fingers and peas.</p> <p>And as I slowly faded into parenthood, I understood more how Emily must have felt at the beginning. Despite this, she has told me that, after that initial pang, she never felt jealous or displaced.</p> <p>Emily and I met for the first time a little while after the bedtime story episode \u2013 a drink in the local pub, with James. It was gut-wrenchingly awkward. James told us that his new wifi password involved the word \u201cpinkflute\u201d and we all laughed far too hard.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Post-divorce parenting involves negotiating differing priorities. Imagine adding another voice into that mix</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It was clear from the conversation that evening that James and Emily intended to work hard to maintain a close relationship in raising their children. So Emily and I made an effort. We didn\u2019t meet for coffee and cake; it was more copious cups of tea in kitchens at birthday parties. And the more we got to know each other, the better it became. We confided in each other about our insecurities and found they were surprisingly similar. We both had moments where we felt like the extra person. </p> <p>Now the two of us go to class assemblies if James is busy. We sit together.

But I\u2019m not really a \u201cstep back\u201d kind of woman. I\u2019ve thrown myself into it all, and James and Emily have let me. While I think there are elements of my friendship with Emily that make James a little uncomfortable \u2013 no man likes to think of his girlfriend and ex-wife talking about him \u2013 he wants there to be cohesion.</p> <p>Emily says she believes it takes a village to raise a family: \u201cI actively encourage my kids to get to know other adults, so that when they need help there will always be safe people to go to. I\u2019m thrilled that they have you to talk to - that they can benefit from your perspective and positive input in their lives.\u201d And I have great admiration for her. I love those children and she values that enormously.</p> <p>The children themselves have extraordinary resilience. I\u2019ve been lucky \u2013 aside from the usual boundary-pushing, I\u2019ve never had any \u201cYou\u2019re not my mum\u201d moments. They\u2019re bright and thoughtful \u2013 we talk it out if there\u2019s a problem. I did once accidentally bump the youngest while moving a chair and she burst into tears saying, \u201cYou hit me with a <em>chair</em>!\u201d and I thought, \u201cBalls \u2013 this looks pretty bad\u2026\u201d</p> <p>But they\u2019ve embraced their extra parent. The moment I was first referred to as a stepmum because I am \u201cbasically like a mum anyway\u201d, my heart nearly exploded in my chest.</p> <p>\u201cParenting is challenging,\u201d Emily says. \u201cAdding a third perspective into the mix can make the whole situation easier for everyone. It just takes an open-minded attitude, some self-awareness on all sides, and the shared goal of providing a positive, stable environment for our kids to grow up in.\u201d</p> <p>So we will continue to work on our friendship; to raise each other up because we fervently believe that this is what women should do; to promote love and respect to these two kick-ass kids we are so fortunate to be raising.</p> <p>And yes, the car\u2019s there any time you want, Emily.</p> <p>\u2022 Lucy Frederick\u2019s standup show about becoming a stepmother, <a href=\"http://www.underbellyedinburgh.co.uk/whats-on/lucy-frederick-famtastic\" title=\"\">Famtastic</a>, is on until 25 August 2019 at Underbelly, Edinburgh, <a href=\"http://www.underbellyedinburgh.co.uk/whats-on/lucy-frederick-famtastic\" title=\"\">underbellyedinburgh.co.uk</a></p> <h2>How step-parents and ex-partners can get along<br></h2> <p>Children are not harmed by divorce or separation, but by continuing conflict.

      "bodyText": "Before Tanya Day sustained a fatal injury while in police custody, she fell asleep on a train. The Yorta Yorta woman, 55, was catching the V/Line service from Echuca to Melbourne on 5 December 2017 to see her family. Day had been drinking. Just past Bendigo, about two hours into her journey, she started to nod off. By Castlemaine she was asleep, her legs allegedly blocking the aisle. As the train pulled in to Castlemaine, the conductor told her to move. He had called the police to request help with an \u201cunruly\u201d drunk passenger who could not find her ticket. The police arrived at 3.10pm and shook Day awake. They decided to arrest her and take her to the police station under an archaic but well-used offence: being found drunk in a public place. Shortly after 8pm, when police would have been preparing to release Day from custody after a four-hour spell to sober up, they realised something was wrong. An ambulance was called, but did not arrive for almost an hour. By the time Day arrived at Bendigo hospital she had been bleeding in her brain for almost five hours as a result of a traumatic injury sustained when she fell, unnoticed, in the cell. A large black bruise covered her forehead. She did not wake between then and 22 December, when she died in Melbourne\u2019s St Vincent\u2019s hospital. A three-week inquest into her death in custody will begin in Melbourne on Monday. The coroner, Caitlin English, has already made two significant findings. The first was that Victoria should abolish the offence of being drunk in public. On Thursday the Andrews government announced it would do so, and set up an expert panel to consider options. The second was unprecedented: that the inquest would consider whether systemic racism contributed to her death. Day\u2019s daughter Apryl Watson, 27, says it did. Day\u2019s children \u2013 Watson, and her sister Belinda Stevens, 38, their brother Warren Stevens, 37, and youngest sister Kimberly Watson, 22 \u2013 have been leading the campaign to get justice for their mother. \u201cYou see plenty of times on V/Line [that] people are on the train intoxicated, or they are asleep, [or] are actually making a scene, and they are unruly, and they are being aggressive, but the police do not get called,\u201d Watson says. \u201cAnd here\u2019s mum, an Aboriginal woman asleep on the train, and she\u2019s deemed unruly? That speaks volumes to us.\u201d An outdated law Victoria and Queensland are the only states in Australia where being drunk in public is still a crime, pending the new Andrews government legislation. Stevens says abolishing the offence is not enough. There must be systemic change to reframe intoxication as a health issue so police do not get involved. \u201cIt\u2019s all good and well to say we\u2019ll remove this law but they can\u2019t then introduce something that will target vulnerable people again,\u201d she says. She cites Western Australia, which no longer has a crime of public drunkenness but does have a crime of drinking in public. Three Indigenous people have died after being arrested while drunk in WA since 2008. \u201cWe are after systemic change and we want a health-based approach and response to the removal of that law,\u201d she says. The Crime Statistics Agency of Victoria says 6,424 people were charged under section 13 of the Summary Offences Act in the 12 months to March this year, more than six times the number of people charged with being drunk and disorderly in public. It is a 40% decrease from the average annual number of public drunkenness charges issued in the past decade. The maximum penalty is a $1,321 fine but most are issued with an infringement notice which sets the penalty at half the maximum fine if paid within 28 days. That is not always possible. Harrison Day, Tanya Day\u2019s uncle, died in police custody in Echuca in 1982 after being arrested for a $10 unpaid fine for a charge of being drunk and disorderly. An analysis by the Human Rights Law Centre, which is representing Day\u2019s family at the inquest, found that in 2017 Aboriginal women were 10 times more likely to be charged for being drunk in public. The other high-risk group are people who are homeless or sleeping rough. Indigenous people continue to die in custody in jurisdictions without public drunkenness laws but where detention remains an acceptable policy response. Cases in Guardian Australia\u2019s Deaths Inside investigation include the death of a 24-year-old Aboriginal man who was charged with assault and, like Day, died of a brain hemorrhage that worsened while he was left to sleep off the drink in a cell in Broome police station; a 51-year-old man who died in the Kalgoorlie police cells; and Ms Mandijarra, who died in Broome police station in 2012 after being arrested for drinking in public. In the Northern Territory, Kwementyaye Briscoe died in the Alice Springs police station in 2012 after being placed in \u201cprotective custody\u201d because he was drunk. Three years later, a Tiwi Island woman died on the footpath outside the Nightcliff sobering-up centre in Darwin. The police who took her to the centre did not check their own records which showed she had a high-risk heart condition.

Maher was deemed too intoxicated to nominate a responsible person. Victoria police did attempt to contact one of Day\u2019s daughters to collect her but they were unable to get to Castlemaine. Stevens says that if Day had been taken to hospital she would \u201c100% be alive today\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s clear to us that from the moment that she had the first interaction with V/Line, the fact that she was an Aboriginal woman and had been drinking were the two main factors that led to the decision making,\u201d she says. \u201cIf she was that intoxicated, and you were concerned about her wellbeing, why wasn\u2019t she ever [given a health assessment]?\u201d It was easier, says Stevens, for authorities to dismiss Day as another drunk Aboriginal woman and make her the scapegoat in her own story.

Maybe they fruit in June in Canada, where they originate; here in Allendale they ripen in August. The name of snowy mespilus celebrates the white clusters of star-shaped spring flowers, fragile looking but standing up to the wind. <em>Mespilus</em> is the botanical name of the medlar, which also has five-petalled flowers.

      "bodyText": "Agitated bird calls drew me to the window that overlooks a long gravel path. At its end, growing either side of a lichen-covered bench, are planted a pair of amelanchiers. From their vigorously shaking branches I knew the blackbirds were having their annual feast of their small berries. Together with a song thrush, they queued up along the drystone wall like holidaymakers at an ice-cream van. Amelanchiers are known variously as Juneberry, snowy mespilus or shadberry. Maybe they fruit in June in Canada, where they originate; here in Allendale they ripen in August. The name of snowy mespilus celebrates the white clusters of star-shaped spring flowers, fragile looking but standing up to the wind. Mespilus is the botanical name of the medlar, which also has five-petalled flowers. Shadberry links its flowering time to the migration of shad, a herring-like fish, from sea to fresh water. These edible berries, the size of petit pois, taste rather like blueberries and can be used in pies and jams or in a variation on sloe gin. They start out red before turning dark purple.

      "bodyText": "Leaders of the world\u2019s major democracies are due to hold emergency talks this weekend on the wildfires engulfing the Amazon, as international efforts to force Brazil to change its deforestation policies gathered momentum. As heads of state and government were due to arrive at the G7 in Biarritz on Saturday, France and Ireland threatened to block the Mercosur free-trade agreement between the EU and South American nations if the government of Jair Bolsonaro does not stop the deforestation of the Amazon, which experts say has fuelled the fires. Other EU members were under pressure to walk away from the Mercosur (Southern Common Market) deal, which is already unpopular among European farmers. The Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, who was first to call the Mercosur deal into question on Friday, said Bolsonaro\u2019s attempt to blame the fires on environmental groups was \u201cOrwellian\u201d. On Friday evening, Bolsonaro used a TV speech to profess \u201cprofound love and respect\u201d for the Amazon but played down both the significance of the fires as well as his administration\u2019s responsibility for them. The Finnish government, which currently chairs the EU, called on member states to consider more trade restrictions. The country\u2019s finance minister, Mika Lintila, said he \u201ccondemns the destruction of the Amazon and calls for Finland and the EU to urgently look into the possibility of banning Brazilian beef imports\u201d. Boris Johnson, who will be attending the G7 summit for the first time as prime minister, has said he was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d by the Amazon conflagration, but was under pressure from Jeremy Corbyn to support punitive measures against Bolsonaro, who the Labour leader said \u201chas allowed and indeed encouraged these fires to take place\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Brazil\u2019s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, has professed to feeling \u201cprofound love and respect\u201d for the Amazon as fires continued to rage in the world\u2019s biggest tropical rainforest and criticism of his environmental policies intensified. In a televised address to the nation \u2013 met with pot-banging protests in several Brazilian cities \u2013 Bolsonaro said he was \u201cnot content\u201d with the situation in the Amazon and was taking \u201cfirm action\u201d to resolve it by deploying troops to the region. But the rightwing populist played down both the significance of the forest fires that have mushroomed into a major political and environmental crisis \u2013 as well as his administration\u2019s responsibility for it. \u201cForest fires exist in the whole world and this cannot serve as a pretext for possible international sanctions,\u201d Bolsonaro said in his brief, scripted address. Forest fires are an annual occurrence in the Amazon region \u2013 about 60% of which lies in Brazil. But experts and campaigners blame the scale of this year\u2019s blaze on the green light they believe Bolsonaro has given to those who wish to destroy the rainforest. Bolsonaro hit back at such criticism in his Friday night address, claiming the spreading of \u201cdisinformation\u201d \u2013 inside or outside Brazil \u2013 would do nothing to solve the Amazon crisis. \u201cBrazil is an example of sustainability,\u201d he claimed, as the Amazon state of Acre became the latest to declare a state of emergency because of the wildfires. \u201cIt is our duty to protect the forest. We are aware of this and we are taking action to fight illegal deforestation and any other criminal activities that put our Amazon at risk,\u201d Bolsonaro added. \u201cWe are a government that shows zero tolerance to crime and it will not be different when it comes to the environment.\u201d Marina Silva, Brazil\u2019s former environment minister, told the Guardian it would take more than propaganda and \u201cwords in the wind\u201d to solve the Amazonian \u201cenvironmental emergency\u201d caused by Bolsonaro\u2019s policies. \u201cBolsonaro won the election with his anti-environment, anti-human rights and anti-indigenous discourse and on taking office he has transformed these words into deeds,\u201d said Silva, who oversaw a significant reduction in deforestation while minister from 2003 until 2008. \u201cThese policies cannot be allowed to prosper.\u201d Amid a growing chorus of international criticism, Donald Trump came to Bolsonaro\u2019s defense on Friday. \u201cI told him if the United States can help with the Amazon Rainforest fires, we stand ready to assist!\u201d the US president tweeted. \u201cOur future Trade prospects are very exciting and our relationship is strong, perhaps stronger than ever before,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHugs from Brazil!\u201d Bolsonaro\u2019s son Carlos tweeted in response. Bolsonaro tweeted that he had discussed \u201ca big trade negotiation\u201d with Trump and that the US president \u201chad also offered to help us protect Amazonia and fight the fires, if we wish, as well as to work together on environmental policies that respect the sovereignty of nations.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Researchers have introduced three dozen hybrid helmeted honeyeaters into the wild in an attempt to prevent the critically endangered bird from dying out because of inbreeding. On Friday, the juvenile birds were released into the Yellingbo Nature Conservation Reserve, which holds the only wild population of critically endangered helmeted honeyeaters, in an unusual attempt at genetic species rescue. The researchers say that without interbreeding, fertility rates within the 230-strong wild population could drop so low that the species would not survive. The hybrids are the product of judicious crossing of the yellow-tufted honeyeater (Lichenostomus melanops) with the helmeted honeyeater (Lichenostomus melanops cassidix), a closely related sub-species, at Healesville Sanctuary, outside Melbourne. The sub-species diverged about 50,000 years ago and interbred in the wild until the helmeted honeyeater population dropped so low that it became isolated from its nearest relatives. It is one of 20 key species targeted under a $30m program by Zoos Victoria to prevent species extinction. A study of 33 years of genetic and breeding data from the wild helmeted honeyeater population, published in the journal Current Biology this month, said the predicted lifetime reproductive success for a bird that was the product of several generations of inbreeding was up to 90% lower than that of the least inbred individuals. Failure to address inbreeding, the study said, would \u201cslow or prevent population recovery, even under intensive management interventions\u201d. The manager of conservation and research at Healesville, Kim Miller, said the hybrid breeding program mimicked historic breeding patterns in the wild. \u201cWe know that as recently as 30 years ago there was regular genetic transfer between the two subspecies,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThat has been essentially disrupted by habitat fragmentation. Our objective is really to replicate what would happen under normal circumstances for these two subspecies.\u201d Healesville bred two generations of the hybrid birds to ensure they were \u201crobust, healthy, and capable of breeding themselves\u201d. Miller said the program was intended to restore fertility rates for wild honeyeaters and would be monitored to ensure the integrity of the unique sub-species was not compromised. \u201cWe have a really good plan in place for how much genetic diversity we are looking to introduce,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s enough to restore the level of genetic transfer between the two species back to its historic levels.\u201d The birds appear identical to helmeted honeyeaters.
