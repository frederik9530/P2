      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for now. Thanks as always for following along and be sure to check back later for a full match report. And there\u2019s the whistle. Barcelona are winners of the inaugural La Liga-Serie A Cup today\u2019s 4-0 thrashing of Napoli, winning 6-1 on aggregate. 88 min: Barcelona have not let up on the gas here, even as it seems Napoli have all but conceded the middle third and raised a white flag. A couple minutes of normal time to go. 85 min: A frustrated Mario Rui comes in late on a challenge and is probably lucky to avoid a second yellow for it, but the referee is content to let the sides play on. 83 min: Coutinho takes a crack from 30 yards. It\u2019s on target and forces a save but an elementary one. 80 min: A rare chance from Napoli here but the shot from outside the area sails high over the crossbar and the head of Ter Stegen, who\u2019s been reduced to a spectator for nearly all of the half. 77 min: And Ruiz very nearly makes it five! But the flag was straight up and it would have been disallowed even if it hadn\u2019t gone just wide of the far post. 75 min: Another switch for Barcelona as Ruiz comes on for the goalscorer Dembele. 72 min: Mario Rui is shown yellow for a late challenge. The wind has come out of the sails of this one quite a bit. 70 min: Today\u2019s official attendance is 60,043, which is about two-thirds capacity of the world\u2019s largest stadium outside of North Korea. 66 min: Vidal, Coutinho and Arthur enter for their first appearances of the preseason along with Umtiti and Rafinha. Exiting the match are Alena, Pique, Griezmann, Suarez and Semedo. All three of Barcelona\u2019s front line are on the score sheet after a clinical finish by Dembele. The Spanish lead 6-1 on aggregate and it seems a big wave of substitutions are forthcoming. 62 min: A couple more changes for Napoli as Mario Rui comes in at left back and Di Lorenzo at right back, taking the places of Hysaj and Ghoulam. A breakdown by Napoli is penalized as Dembele slips an inch-perfect pass to Suarez, who curls in a gorgeous goal from the edge of the area into the top-right corner of the frame. A highlight-reel strike makes it two for the Uruguayan on the day. A wonderfully constructed team goal by Barcelona with no less than a dozen uninterrupted short passes ending with Jordi Alba darting into the six-yard box to poke it home unmolested. Simply beautiful. 54 min: Napoli win a corner but it\u2019s poorly delivered toward the near post in defiance of the many white shirts in the box and out for a goal kick. Wasteful, that. 51 min: Barcelona are on the break once again behind Dembele and he wins a corner, the team\u2019s second of the match. Every outfield player in the penalty area. It\u2019s played long to Suarez, but his volley is mishit and dragged wide of the goal. A rollocking start for the Spanish side here in the second half. A gorgeous flick from Suarez to Griezmann, who looks quite a bit offside. Griezmann\u2019s shot is saved by the keeper, but Suarez charges in to stuff home the rebound and Barcelona are on the board today and ahead 3-1 on aggregate. The Napoli players are protesting vehemently. Indeed, Griezmann did look a yard offside ... but the goal stands and Bar\u00e7a are in the driver\u2019s seat. 46 min: And we\u2019re off for the second half! Three substitutions for Napoli at the interval with Zielinski, Luperto and Insigne coming on for Allan, Chiriches and Elmas. No changes for Barcelona. The players and referees are making their way back on the pitch for the second half. We should be under way momentarily. Barcelona had the advantages in possession and chances, but Napoli have held the to a scoreless draw through 45 minutes. Plenty more to come from Ann Arbor. 43 min: Suarez hits a volley from inside the area and forces a good save upstairs from Meret. He wins the first corner of the day for the Spanish side, but nothing comes of it and it\u2019s easily cleared. 41 min: Another pacy run into the final third by Dembele, who cuts into the center and this time takes a shot himself from the top of the box. It\u2019s a fine effort hit with venom but it\u2019s just wide of the goal. The best chance of the game so far. 40 min: Griezmann goes down rather easily, prompting a cacophony of jeers from the pro-Barcelona crowd. But the referee correctly urges both sides to play on. 39 min: Verdi comes in on the right side and rips a left-footed shot from about 20 yards, but it\u2019s poorly hit and sails wide of the goal for a goal kick. 35 min: A good chance for Barcelona as Griezmann tries to pick out Pique but it falls to Dembele, whose shot is blocked. 34 min: A Mertens shot flicks out off De Jong and Napoli win the first corner of the day ... but it\u2019s quickly turned away back into the middle third. 33 min: A steady technical build-up from Napoli over the last two minutes ends with a head-scratcher of a long-range shot from Allan, which is not well delivered and easily handled by Ter Stegen. 30 min: Dembele storms forward to pressure the Napoli back line again, but once more his final pass to Suarez is way off the mark, prompting an eye-roll from the frustrated Uruguayan striker. 27 min: The choppy pace of the last 10 minutes continues as Manolas is caught late by Griezmann on a challenge and takes his time picking himself off the pitch. 22 min: Napoli win a free kick from the edge of the area, but it\u2019s headed away from the mouth of the goal by Pique and Barcelona are quick on the counter-attack. As the Spaniards build up, the Napoli left back Ghoulam goes down with an injury ... right on time for the designated hydration break. 20 min: De Jong is down momentarily for an injury, but it won\u2019t require a visit from the medical staff. Not quite a capacity crowd today in the Big House, but it sure is loud. 17 min: Dembele makes another marauding run up the right flank into the attacking third but his final pass is just off the mark. The French winger has been a handful today. 13 min: The ball is slipped into space behind the Napoli defense and Suarez runs onto it, but he can\u2019t muscle it toward his shooting foot and he\u2019s dispossessed. Moments later Griezmann has a golden chance eight yards from goal but his left-footed shot skids inches wide of the far post. 10 min: Some nice interplay between Suarez and Dembele on the right side ends with Suarez crossing it into space, but there are no yellow shirts in the vicinity and it\u2019s easily collected by Meret. 7 min: Suarez is hacked down about 40 yards from the goal and wins a free kick but it\u2019s played short. The Spaniards have dominated possession in the early going and Napoli are having trouble getting the ball out of their half. 3 min: No Messi, no Rakitic, but Barcelona still looking awfully dangerous in the opening stages with a couple of near-chances. 1 min: And they\u2019re off! Barcelona attacking from left to right in their all-yellow away strips, Napoli in their all-white third kits. Napoli pressing very high up the pitch to start out here. The players have taken the pitch in Ann Arbor. Five changes for Napoli from last week\u2019s opening leg, a whopping nine for Barcelona. We should be under way any moment now. Hello and welcome to Ann Arbor for today\u2019s friendly between Napoli and Barcelona. We\u2019re just under a half hour from kickoff at the 107,601-seat home of the Michigan Wolverines, so we\u2019ll dispense with the throat-clearing ahead of today\u2019s preseason finale and get right to the team sheets. Barcelona XI: Ter Stegen; Semedo, Piqu\u00e9, Lenglet, Alba; Roberto, De Jong, Ale\u00f1\u00e1; Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, Su\u00e1rez, Griezmann Subs: Neto, Pe\u00f1a, Todibo, Umtiti, Wagu\u00e9, Firpo, Busquets, Rakitic, Arthur, Vidal, Puig, Coutinho, Rafinha, P\u00e9rez, Ruiz Napoli XI: Meret; Hysaj, Manolas, Chiriches, Ghoulam; Verdi, Allan, Fabi\u00e1n, Elmas; Milik, Mertens Subs: Ospina, Karnezis, Maksimovic, Luperto, Di Lorenzo, M\u00e1rio Rui, Zielinski, Gaetano, Callej\u00f3n, Younes, Insigne Bryan will be here shortly.",

The first is the myth of household budget comparison and the second is what I call the grasshopper fable of government budgets. The belief that the government should run its budget like a household really needs to die a quick death. We hear it all the time \u2013 and it underlies the whole \u201csurplus is better than deficit\u201d line that is practically considered a statement of scientific fact by too many otherwise sensible people in politics and the media (and by extension the voting public). Your household\u2019s expenditure needs are nothing like a government\u2019s and your budgetary limitation completely opposite. Households don\u2019t get the opportunity to print money should they be a bit short when it comes to pay the bills. They also don\u2019t get to borrow money at interest rates lower than inflation. This week the interest rate for Australian government 10-year bonds went below 1%. Show me a household that can take out a 10-year loan at a 0.96% rate, despite the fact that their level of debt has risen over the past six years from $257bn to $549bn, and I\u2019ll start listening to you saying the government needs to budget like a household. The second budgetary fairytale is based on the grasshopper and ant fable \u2013 that the government needs to build up its budgetary surplus when times are good for when winter hits and we need to have savings to rely on. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In essence this suggests that, should fiscal stimulus be needed, the economy reacts better to a government reducing a surplus than increasing a deficit. But there is no evidence this is the case. The economy responds to when \u2013 and how effectively \u2013 that stimulus is deployed. Spend government money on infrastructure that produces no economic benefit, then it doesn\u2019t matter whether it reduces a surplus or increases a deficit, it is still wasted money. This doesn\u2019t mean you can always run ever-larger deficits and not have to worry, but it does mean we worry far too much about the size of our deficit and we worry about it mostly for reasons that are based on political folktale spin rather than any economic rationale. I note this because on Wednesday, the treasurer Josh Frydenberg responded to questions on ABC\u2019s 7:30 about whether the government would \u201creset\u201d policy should international trends require it, by stating that \u201cwe\u2019re committed to a surplus\u201d. Earlier that day he told the ABC\u2019s Peter Ryan when asked if the trade ructions between China and the US could \u201cend up hurting your projections for a budget surplus\u201d that \u201cwe will still deliver a surplus next year. Absolutely determined to do that\u201d. But why? It is clear that delivering a budget surplus is all about government revenue and little else. In the final six years of the Howard government, which saw budget surpluses, revenue was never lower than 25% of GDP. The first time since then that revenue has reached that level was 2018-19. Had revenue stayed at that 25% of GDP level, given how much governments spent each year, we would have had a budget surplus in six of the past nine years. For the current financial year the government predicts revenue of 25.2% of GDP and, lo and behold, it is also predicting a surplus. But if revenue falls because company tax revenue is lower than expected because iron ore prices fall \u2013 as has happened since the China-US trade war has fired up, with prices falling from a five-year high of US$125.77 a tonne in July to now around US$96 a tonne. Then the chances of a budget surplus fall as well. And it also comes at a time when the Reserve Bank continues to cry out for help stimulating the economy. On Friday the governor of the RBA, Philip Lowe, told the House economics committee that \u201cmonetary policy is not the country\u2019s only option.

      "body": "<p>The Extinction Rebellion protesters think you should be angry. They want politicians and opinion columnists to be angry. The more people they upset stopping traffic in the Brisbane city centre \u2013 the louder the car horns, the more vicious the insults \u2013 the more certain it is they\u2019ll be back.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not an enjoyable experience, we don\u2019t take pleasure in doing it,\u201d says Emma Dorge, an activist arrested in Brisbane on Tuesday, during a day of mass civil disobedience that shut down Australia\u2019s third-largest city.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a polarising tactic. But this is an emergency, and we\u2019re out of other options.\u201d</p> <p>Extinction Rebellion, the decentralised global movement calling for aggressive action on the climate crisis, has engaged in similar disruption tactics in major cities on every continent. Those protests have been most effective when they are most polarising, like in Queensland, where talking and writing and screaming and marching about the climate emergency has not shifted public sentiment; a state home to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/19/great-barrier-reef-authority-urges-fastest-possible-action-on-emissions\">threatened Great Barrier Reef</a>, and also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/13/adani-cleared-to-start-carmichael-coalmine-work-as-groundwater-plans-approved\">the world\u2019s most controversial coal project</a>.</p> <p>Seventy-two people were arrested and charged by police during \u201crebellion day\u201d protests in the heart of Brisbane on Tuesday.

That\u2019s what we\u2019re building towards.</p> <p>\u201cThese disruptions will only increase in frequency and duration. We\u2019re not planning to stop until all of our demands are met.\u201d</p> <p>Clancey Maher was studying to be a nurse, working two jobs, when she headed north from Canberra about two years ago. Since then she has been involved in several anti-coal and climate protests.</p> <p>\u201cWe are not kidding ourselves,\u201d Maher says. \u201cWe\u2019re not winning every person who gets stopped in a car. It\u2019s necessary to force a reaction because the issue is so urgent.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the key tactics is definitely disruption. </p> <p>\u201cYou can ignore a petition, you can ignore a rally. This way it promotes public debate on the issue. If you weren\u2019t already talking about climate change at the very least now you\u2019re talking about the disruptions.\u201d</p> <h2>A line in the sand</h2> <p>Extinction Rebellion\u2019s global focus lends itself to actions in larger cities; pushing for the sorts of transformative changes that can be enacted by governments and corporations, the powerbrokers who might be caught in the commuter jams. About 1,000 people in have been involved in those various protests in Brisbane, with more than 100 arrested.</p> <p>At the same time, the movement runs in parallel to the work of dozens of coordinated environmental groups \u2013 some of which run conventional public campaigns and others engaging in blockades \u2013 that target the operations of prominent coal companies and their <a href=\"https://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/business/stopadani-protesters-target-ghd-in-national-week-of-action/news-story/ed1a3942e20e2d506b9c49b4fbcc5706\">contractors</a>.

      "bodyText": "The Extinction Rebellion protesters think you should be angry. They want politicians and opinion columnists to be angry. The more people they upset stopping traffic in the Brisbane city centre \u2013 the louder the car horns, the more vicious the insults \u2013 the more certain it is they\u2019ll be back. \u201cIt\u2019s not an enjoyable experience, we don\u2019t take pleasure in doing it,\u201d says Emma Dorge, an activist arrested in Brisbane on Tuesday, during a day of mass civil disobedience that shut down Australia\u2019s third-largest city. \u201cIt is a polarising tactic. But this is an emergency, and we\u2019re out of other options.\u201d Extinction Rebellion, the decentralised global movement calling for aggressive action on the climate crisis, has engaged in similar disruption tactics in major cities on every continent. Those protests have been most effective when they are most polarising, like in Queensland, where talking and writing and screaming and marching about the climate emergency has not shifted public sentiment; a state home to the threatened Great Barrier Reef, and also the world\u2019s most controversial coal project. Seventy-two people were arrested and charged by police during \u201crebellion day\u201d protests in the heart of Brisbane on Tuesday. They have been stopping commuter traffic in the city for months. As outrage grows, so does the sense that climate change is finally subject of the anger it deserves. Dorge, who works as a midwife and has previously been involved in anti-coal protests, says: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing holding our governments accountable now. \u201cBut shutting down central business districts of cities, if they can\u2019t function anymore, if our cities are continually shut down and immobilised, that will force action. That\u2019s what we\u2019re building towards. \u201cThese disruptions will only increase in frequency and duration. We\u2019re not planning to stop until all of our demands are met.\u201d Clancey Maher was studying to be a nurse, working two jobs, when she headed north from Canberra about two years ago. Since then she has been involved in several anti-coal and climate protests. \u201cWe are not kidding ourselves,\u201d Maher says. \u201cWe\u2019re not winning every person who gets stopped in a car. It\u2019s necessary to force a reaction because the issue is so urgent. \u201cOne of the key tactics is definitely disruption. \u201cYou can ignore a petition, you can ignore a rally. This way it promotes public debate on the issue. If you weren\u2019t already talking about climate change at the very least now you\u2019re talking about the disruptions.\u201d A line in the sand Extinction Rebellion\u2019s global focus lends itself to actions in larger cities; pushing for the sorts of transformative changes that can be enacted by governments and corporations, the powerbrokers who might be caught in the commuter jams. About 1,000 people in have been involved in those various protests in Brisbane, with more than 100 arrested. At the same time, the movement runs in parallel to the work of dozens of coordinated environmental groups \u2013 some of which run conventional public campaigns and others engaging in blockades \u2013 that target the operations of prominent coal companies and their contractors. Many of the Extinction Rebellion protesters have converged on Brisbane while maintaining links to the direct action movement. A day after the chaotic Extinction Rebellion protests in Brisbane, the group Frontline Action on Coal (Flac) issued a long-awaited \u201cred alert\u201d \u2013 a call for activists to head to central Queensland and to join physical efforts to stop Adani\u2019s Carmichael coalmine. Carmichael has become the totem for both climate activists and backers of the coal industry \u2013 a new thermal coalmine, potentially opening up a new thermal coal basin, built at a time when the calls for action on climate change have become more desperate. The Adani project is a line in the sand \u2013 or a hole in the central Queensland dirt \u2013 for many activists and backers of the coal industry. For several years, Flac has maintained a camp at a rural property between Bowen and Collinsville; a potential base for launching protest activities at the Carmichael mine site, along the proposed rail route, or at the Abbot Point coal terminal. Flac expects potentially thousands to head north in response to its call. \u201cWe need mass occupancy and mass amounts of people to stop this mine from going ahead,\u201d says Amy, a Flac spokeswoman. \u201cWe\u2019ve called the red alert because we now believe that it\u2019s time for everyone to start mobilising and heading to central Queensland. \u201cIt\u2019s about getting people to understand that they now need to shift to playing a more active part in stopping [the Carmichael mine]. It\u2019s about getting those people who say they\u2019re against Adani to physically get involved and take part in direct action.\u201d As the company began land-clearing works on Wednesday, two Flac activists temporarily stopped about 17 bulldozers by suspending themselves from poles. They say attempts to stop work at Carmichael will continue and escalate. Sophie, a midwife working in central Queensland, is one of many preparing to take a break from her job to take part in the protests. \u201cI feel like the next few months, the next few years are going to be super critical,\u201d Sophie says. \u201cI really love what I do but I want to ensure the kids I see every day being born are coming into a safe climate future.\u201d Police action called into question As the disruptions in Brisbane become more frequent, the backlash has amped-up in volume and vitriol. In News Corp newspaper the Courier-Mail, protesters have been described variously as \u201cferals\u201d, \u201cratbags\u201d, \u201cidiots\u201d, \u201ctwerps\u201d, \u201cselfish, conceited, misguided \u2026 ideological zealots\u201d, \u201cunemployed thugs\u201d and more. Some commentators have even pined for the days of authoritarian Queensland premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen, who cracked down on street marches and cut a secret deal with police not to penalise officers who acted to suppress protests. The current Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, has been more measured but called for the demonstrations to stop. \u201cWhen you stop people going to and from their workplace, I don\u2019t think people like that,\u201d Palaszczuk said. The tactics of police have, during the past few weeks, become noticeably more direct. At first, police resisted making mass arrests when protesters performed a \u201cswarm\u201d, blocking an intersection for up to 10 minutes. On Tuesday a young man was chased from the road by a police officer and tackled by a bystander. He broke his arm. Police have also been accused of abusing their power by using bail conditions to punish protesters and shield corporate interests. Fuelling the anger is the way the state crackdown on environmental protesters compares to its treatment of corporations who break environmental laws. Last month, the Guardian revealed that a thermal coalmine in the Darling Downs region, New Acland, committed a \u201cmajor\u201d breach of the state\u2019s environmental protection act by drilling 27 illegal bores. The company was fined $3,152. Queensland courts have given activists fines almost 20 times that amount for staging protests. Al Wicks was fined $61,000 earlier this year for blocking coal trains. Others face aggressive civil damages claims launched by corporate interests. \u201cThey want us to pay for our damages.

      "body": "<p>If he dwells on it, Lt Col Harry Smith can still see, vividly, the blood on the trees on the enemy\u2019s escape path. There was so much blood. In the days after the three savage hours that was the battle of Long Tan, his soldiers were finding body parts, carnage and corpses spread across the battlefield. But it was that blood, \u201cthe blood of all the others that were dragged away, wounded, suffering\u201d, that affects him the most. \u201cThat worries me more than a dead body.\u201d In the eerie silence, in the pervasive gloom, among the smell of the dead in the Long Tan rubber plantation, latex ran down trees punctured by bullets and mingled with the blood.</p> <p>Long Tan had been a battle fought against almost impossible odds. A ferocious battle, a defining action of the Vietnam war. On the afternoon of 18 August 1966, a single infantry company of 108 mostly inexperienced Australian and New Zealand soldiers engaged with a regiment of 2,500 battle-hardened Viet Cong and North Vietnam army troops. Almost surrounded, outnumbered 10 to one, they withstood Viet Cong attacks in cyclonic rain.</p> <p>Now, 86, Smith is sitting on the patio of his Sunshine Coast home as he recalls that desperate day, 53 years ago, now the subject of the feature film Danger Close. A small, wiry, compact man, there is still something indomitable about him. Age has not wearied him. He was 33 when he commanded his company of early 20-year-olds from south Queensland in the battle for their lives.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/17/vietnam-battle-long-tan-50th-anniversary-cancelled\">Anger as Vietnam cancels event marking 50 years since battle of Long T\u00e2n</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Australians had recently established a stronghold at Nui Dat, in the middle of Viet Cong supply routes in Phuoc Tuy province. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t have enough troops to protect the base,\u201d says the film\u2019s producer, Martin Walsh, who also made the documentary Battle of Long Tan.</p> <p>Smith believes that Brigadier Oliver Jackson had intelligence that there was a regiment massing on the other side of the rubber plantation, 5km from base. \u201cAnd he didn\u2019t pass it on to my commanding officer, Col Townsend, he held it at the headquarters and didn\u2019t tell us. His excuse was that he didn\u2019t think it was the enemy in force, he thought it was just reconnaissance. You have to ask what he thought the reconnaissance was for.\u201d Had he known, says Smith, \u201cThere is no way in the world I would have sallied forth into the rubber plantation with 100 men to face an enemy regiment with 2,000 or more soldiers.\u201d</p> <p>On the afternoon of 18 August, the focus was on a concert being given by the Australian singers Col Joye and Little Pattie. To their chagrin, Delta Company 6RAR weren\u2019t at the concert; they were out on patrol on the edge of the rubber plantation. Smith recalls it being \u201cdeathly quiet\u201d. He believes the enemy \u201cwere on their way to attack Nui Dat on the night of the concert. We just happened to get in the way\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"657145b165ee7b81377c598597c7d0f393534004\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/657145b165ee7b81377c598597c7d0f393534004/0_118_3543_2126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lt Col Harry Smith was the officer commanding Delta Company 6th Battalion Royal Australian Regiment at the battle of Long Tan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lt Col Harry Smith was the officer commanding Delta Company 6th Battalion Royal Australian Regiment at the battle of Long Tan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rob Maccoll/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The company halted just under a rise in the ground. It would protect them in a defensive position, with the bullets going just over their heads. \u201cAnd to our advantage, they were silhouetted in the gunfire smoke, making easy targets for my machine gunners and riflemen.\u201d At about 4pm all hell broke loose. 11 Platoon, which was out in front, took heavy casualties. The enemy were firing with machine guns, the monsoon hit in full force, with thunder and lightning, turning the ground into liquid mud, reducing visibility to almost nothing. The rain came down so hard on to the red earth that it kicked up a mist, which helped camouflage them. At 4.25 Smith called the commanding officer, Townsend, requesting that reinforcements be helicoptered, but was refused. Neither reinforcements or helicopters were available. In his book The Battle of Long Tan: The Company Commander\u2019s Story, Smith wrote: \u201cAs though we were all at a ladies\u2019 tea party in downtown Toorak, Townsend instead proposed an Alpha Company reinforcement force would come out in armoured carriers \u2018later that afternoon\u2019!\u201d</p> <p>By 4.40pm, 11 Platoon were under attack on three sides and separated from the other two platoons. Major Morrie Stanley from the Royal New Zealand Artillery was working off grid references from platoon commanders trying to read muddy maps, relaying them to the artillery guns 5km away, who were landing them with deadly accuracy only 50 metres in front of the beleaguered soldiers, six rounds a minute. \u201cThe artillery fired 3,500 rounds of high explosives which took a terrible toll on the enemy and saved us from annihilation.\u201d And still the enemy kept coming and coming and the soldiers kept firing and firing. The noise was incredible, the tracers lit up sky.</p> <p>Smith kept moving his platoons into strategic positions, at times without radio communication, to within metres of the enemy. It was all business. \u201cI was too bloody busy to be frightened,\u201d he says. \u201cEverything I did was an automatic reaction, your mind just tells you what to do. I was giving orders to my platoon, talking on the radio, I didn\u2019t have five minutes to sit down and be scared. Afterwards I thought, shit, why am I alive?\u201d</p> <p>Running out of ammunition Smith requested RAAF helicopter resupplies. He didn\u2019t know that this was being delayed by arguments at Nui Dat over standard operating procedure of air staff not being allowed into unsafe conditions. Chopper pilots Bob Grandin and Frank Riley who had been there to deliver Little Pattie and Col Joye overheard this, and knew 6RAR was in desperate trouble. Riley stepped forward. \u201cI am the captain in charge of my aircraft and I am going out.\u201d They didn\u2019t ask for permission so that no one could say no. They just went. The soldiers were down to just a few rounds of ammunition each when the choppers took off, with 50-metre visibility, flying at treetop level. Overloaded with ammunition, they struggled to get the choppers off the ground. It was a suicide mission but it was the right thing to do.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a1b40d12e0bbe06f9b6fa71ed0dc54c86ecb2b8a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1b40d12e0bbe06f9b6fa71ed0dc54c86ecb2b8a/0_42_1369_821/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harry Smith (left)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harry Smith (left): \u2018Wars are never going to cease as long as the world is the world.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Big Sky Publishing</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The armoured personnel carriers (APCs carrying infantry) had been held back for nearly an hour. Brigadier Jackson had intelligence that there was another Viet Cong regiment north-west of the base, and was concerned that Long Tan was a ruse to draw the Australians out and leave the base unprotected. Just as 6RAR was preparing for a huge final assault from the enemy, the APCs arrived more than three hours after the battle had begun and an hour and a half after Smith had requested reinforcements. The enemy retreated, and the only sound in the plantation was the ticking as the engines cooled down.</p> <p>Seventeen Australian soldiers had been killed and 25 wounded; one died nine days later. Because of medic Phil \u201cDoc\u201d Dobson, who had rudimentary first aid training and like all medics was in the army band in peace time, not one of the horribly wounded in the ditch died.

      "bodyText": "If he dwells on it, Lt Col Harry Smith can still see, vividly, the blood on the trees on the enemy\u2019s escape path. There was so much blood. In the days after the three savage hours that was the battle of Long Tan, his soldiers were finding body parts, carnage and corpses spread across the battlefield. But it was that blood, \u201cthe blood of all the others that were dragged away, wounded, suffering\u201d, that affects him the most. \u201cThat worries me more than a dead body.\u201d In the eerie silence, in the pervasive gloom, among the smell of the dead in the Long Tan rubber plantation, latex ran down trees punctured by bullets and mingled with the blood. Long Tan had been a battle fought against almost impossible odds. A ferocious battle, a defining action of the Vietnam war. On the afternoon of 18 August 1966, a single infantry company of 108 mostly inexperienced Australian and New Zealand soldiers engaged with a regiment of 2,500 battle-hardened Viet Cong and North Vietnam army troops. Almost surrounded, outnumbered 10 to one, they withstood Viet Cong attacks in cyclonic rain. Now, 86, Smith is sitting on the patio of his Sunshine Coast home as he recalls that desperate day, 53 years ago, now the subject of the feature film Danger Close. A small, wiry, compact man, there is still something indomitable about him. Age has not wearied him. He was 33 when he commanded his company of early 20-year-olds from south Queensland in the battle for their lives. The Australians had recently established a stronghold at Nui Dat, in the middle of Viet Cong supply routes in Phuoc Tuy province. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t have enough troops to protect the base,\u201d says the film\u2019s producer, Martin Walsh, who also made the documentary Battle of Long Tan. Smith believes that Brigadier Oliver Jackson had intelligence that there was a regiment massing on the other side of the rubber plantation, 5km from base. \u201cAnd he didn\u2019t pass it on to my commanding officer, Col Townsend, he held it at the headquarters and didn\u2019t tell us. His excuse was that he didn\u2019t think it was the enemy in force, he thought it was just reconnaissance. You have to ask what he thought the reconnaissance was for.\u201d Had he known, says Smith, \u201cThere is no way in the world I would have sallied forth into the rubber plantation with 100 men to face an enemy regiment with 2,000 or more soldiers.\u201d On the afternoon of 18 August, the focus was on a concert being given by the Australian singers Col Joye and Little Pattie. To their chagrin, Delta Company 6RAR weren\u2019t at the concert; they were out on patrol on the edge of the rubber plantation. Smith recalls it being \u201cdeathly quiet\u201d. He believes the enemy \u201cwere on their way to attack Nui Dat on the night of the concert. We just happened to get in the way\u201d. The company halted just under a rise in the ground. It would protect them in a defensive position, with the bullets going just over their heads. \u201cAnd to our advantage, they were silhouetted in the gunfire smoke, making easy targets for my machine gunners and riflemen.\u201d At about 4pm all hell broke loose. 11 Platoon, which was out in front, took heavy casualties. The enemy were firing with machine guns, the monsoon hit in full force, with thunder and lightning, turning the ground into liquid mud, reducing visibility to almost nothing. The rain came down so hard on to the red earth that it kicked up a mist, which helped camouflage them. At 4.25 Smith called the commanding officer, Townsend, requesting that reinforcements be helicoptered, but was refused. Neither reinforcements or helicopters were available. In his book The Battle of Long Tan: The Company Commander\u2019s Story, Smith wrote: \u201cAs though we were all at a ladies\u2019 tea party in downtown Toorak, Townsend instead proposed an Alpha Company reinforcement force would come out in armoured carriers \u2018later that afternoon\u2019!\u201d By 4.40pm, 11 Platoon were under attack on three sides and separated from the other two platoons. Major Morrie Stanley from the Royal New Zealand Artillery was working off grid references from platoon commanders trying to read muddy maps, relaying them to the artillery guns 5km away, who were landing them with deadly accuracy only 50 metres in front of the beleaguered soldiers, six rounds a minute. \u201cThe artillery fired 3,500 rounds of high explosives which took a terrible toll on the enemy and saved us from annihilation.\u201d And still the enemy kept coming and coming and the soldiers kept firing and firing. The noise was incredible, the tracers lit up sky. Smith kept moving his platoons into strategic positions, at times without radio communication, to within metres of the enemy. It was all business. \u201cI was too bloody busy to be frightened,\u201d he says. \u201cEverything I did was an automatic reaction, your mind just tells you what to do. I was giving orders to my platoon, talking on the radio, I didn\u2019t have five minutes to sit down and be scared. Afterwards I thought, shit, why am I alive?\u201d Running out of ammunition Smith requested RAAF helicopter resupplies. He didn\u2019t know that this was being delayed by arguments at Nui Dat over standard operating procedure of air staff not being allowed into unsafe conditions. Chopper pilots Bob Grandin and Frank Riley who had been there to deliver Little Pattie and Col Joye overheard this, and knew 6RAR was in desperate trouble. Riley stepped forward. \u201cI am the captain in charge of my aircraft and I am going out.\u201d They didn\u2019t ask for permission so that no one could say no. They just went. The soldiers were down to just a few rounds of ammunition each when the choppers took off, with 50-metre visibility, flying at treetop level. Overloaded with ammunition, they struggled to get the choppers off the ground. It was a suicide mission but it was the right thing to do. The armoured personnel carriers (APCs carrying infantry) had been held back for nearly an hour. Brigadier Jackson had intelligence that there was another Viet Cong regiment north-west of the base, and was concerned that Long Tan was a ruse to draw the Australians out and leave the base unprotected. Just as 6RAR was preparing for a huge final assault from the enemy, the APCs arrived more than three hours after the battle had begun and an hour and a half after Smith had requested reinforcements. The enemy retreated, and the only sound in the plantation was the ticking as the engines cooled down. Seventeen Australian soldiers had been killed and 25 wounded; one died nine days later. Because of medic Phil \u201cDoc\u201d Dobson, who had rudimentary first aid training and like all medics was in the army band in peace time, not one of the horribly wounded in the ditch died. The Vietnamese left 245 dead on the battlefield, but Smith believes the toll was much higher. He says the men didn\u2019t talk about it much after the battle. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a lot of confession afterwards. Platoon commanders talked with their section commanders, I put in a patrol report. But it wasn\u2019t ever discussed in detail. I think the senior officers were embarrassed that we had been sent out but not told that the enemy was there.

But is this the green miracle patients have been waiting for? </p> \n<p>This week, the UK\u2019s National Institute for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/health\">Health</a> and Care Excellence <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/aug/08/watchdog-declines-to-back-nhs-cannabis-treatment-for-epilepsy\">declined to approve medicinal cannabis for use in children with severe epilepsy on the NHS</a>, saying there was not enough evidence to support its use. In 2018, however, <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-drug-comprised-active-ingredient-derived-marijuana-treat-rare-severe-forms\">the US Food and Drug Administration approved a cannabidiol</a> for use in children with two types of severe epilepsy. So what is the situation in Australia, and is there evidence to support all the hype?</p> \n<h2>Can patients access medicinal cannabis in Australia?</h2> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/30/medicinal-cannabis-crops-now-legal-in-australia\">federal government approved medicinal cannabis</a> to treat a limited number of conditions in 2016. While only one product, Sativex, is registered with the Therapeutic Goods Administration, the government allows medical practitioners to apply for a special patient-by-patient permit to prescribe unregistered drugs which have met quality and manufacturing standards, through a process known as the Special Access Scheme B (SASB).</p> \n<p>Patient interest is strong. <a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/8/7/e022101\">A study of GPs conducted last year</a> found that more than two out of five had received a patient request for medicinal cannabis in the preceding three months. Following a streamlining of the SASB process, the number of medicinal cannabis permits <a href=\"https://www.tga.gov.au/access-medicinal-cannabis-products-1\">approved has rapidly increased over the past year</a>, from 229 in August 2018 to 2,206 in July 2019. As of the end of July, more than 11,000 SASB approvals had been made by the TGA.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/07/luxembourg-to-be-first-european-country-to-legalise-cannabis\">Luxembourg to be first European country to legalise cannabis</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s like a hockey stick curve,\u201d says Dr Sanjay Nijhawan, medical director of Cannabis Access Clinics, which has facilitated around one-fifth of all medicinal cannabis permits in Australia. \u201cIt\u2019s on a vertical now.\u201d</p> \n<p>It isn\u2019t cheap. No medicinal cannabis is currently available on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Sativex, approved to treat multiple sclerosis patients, <a href=\"https://www.msaustralia.org.au/sites/default/files/Sativex%20V3%20final.pdf\">costs about $745</a> for a six- to eight-week supply. Other unregistered drugs may be cheaper.</p> \n<h2>Which conditions can it help?</h2> \n<p>While there is high community and media interest in medicinal cannabis, the scientific community is approaching the drug with caution, noting that while there is some evidence to back it in some cases, the strength of the research into cannabis needs improvement.</p> \n<p>In a review of the science, <a href=\"https://www.tga.gov.au/community-qa/medicinal-cannabis-products-patient-information\">the TGA found strongest evidence</a> for its use in childhood epilepsy, and limited evidence related to palliative care, MS, chronic pain, and addressing the symptoms of chemotherapy patients.</p> \n<p>The Australian Medical Association identifies potential use for medical cannabis in such conditions, but while the evidence base is growing, the AMA says, the drug remains \u201cexperimental\u201d.</p> \n<p>Assoc Prof Vicki Kotsirilos, of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, says: \u201cThe evidence for medicinal cannabis is limited and inconclusive, but there is some evidence that does suggest that there is a role for medicinal cannabis products in a number of health conditions,\u201d in line with those reviewed by the TGA.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0547ee37-c8db-4894-84ea-d113f28006f8\" data-atom-type=\"profile\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Profile\">\n    <p><strong>Cannabis: a history</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The earliest written reference to cannabis comes from China in the third millennium BC, but archaeological evidence suggests that hemp, probably for use in fabrics, was cultivated as early as 8,000BC. Native to Central Asia and India, the plant \u2013 known as ganja in Sanskrit \u2013 appears to have been recognised for its psychoactive properties among several pre-Christian cultures, some of which used it in rituals.</p>\n    <p>It was banned in parts of the Islamic world in the 14th century, not to mention in some British colonies, but was not widely proscribed across the world until the US took against it. A series of regulations in the US culminated in the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 that banned possession or transfer of the drug, except for medicinal use. But it was not outlawed for all types of use until 1970, as the establishment reacted to hippie culture \u2013 a crackdown that continued with President Nixon\u2019s so-called \u201cwar on drugs\u201d, which saw the US place pressure on international governments to follow suit.</p>\n    <p>While countries such as the Netherlands have long defied such pressure, tolerating both medicinal and recreational use, international momentum towards legalisation has only begun to pick up in recent years with relaxation of the law in North America.</p>\n    <p>California kicked off the legalisation of medicinal cannabis in 1996, several states had legalised recreational use by 2012 and a majority of states had legalised medicinal cannabis by 2016. It remains illegal under US federal law. Canada lifted a ban on recreational use in 2018, while the UK legalised medicinal marijuana in the same year, albeit subject to tight restrictions.</p>\n    <p>According to the World Health Organization, there are about 147 million cannabis users worldwide, some 2.5% of the global population. While the US market is exploding thanks to liberalisation of laws at state level, Europe is predicted to be the world\u2019s biggest and most lucrative market for medicinal cannabis.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Is there evidence to support it?</h2> \n<p>In reviewing the research, <a href=\"https://www.racgp.org.au/advocacy/position-statements/view-all-position-statements/clinical-and-practice-management/medical-cannabis\">the RACGP reports</a> that studies show that for young epilepsy sufferers, who had exhausted first-line treatments, one in five patients reported an improvement in quality of life and one in eight found a 50% reduction in seizures. One review of medicinal cannabis use in those suffering chronic pain found that one in 22 patients reported a 30% reduction in pain.</p> \n<p>Medicinal cannabis comes in different forms and potencies. The cannabis plant contains around 100 cannabinoids, but the ones of particular therapeutic interest are THC (which is the psychoactive compound, used in treatment of conditions such as nausea and muscle spasticity) and cannabidiol (CBD), which has been used in epilepsy treatment.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/feb/19/doctors-warn-against-rush-to-prescribe-medicinal-cannabis\">Doctors warn against rush to prescribe medicinal cannabis</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Commercially available drugs can take the form of pills, patches or oils and contain different combinations of THC and CBD.

      "bodyText": "More Australians are using medicinal cannabis to treat a host of health problems as reports of its supposed healing powers flood the media. But is this the green miracle patients have been waiting for? This week, the UK\u2019s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence declined to approve medicinal cannabis for use in children with severe epilepsy on the NHS, saying there was not enough evidence to support its use. In 2018, however, the US Food and Drug Administration approved a cannabidiol for use in children with two types of severe epilepsy. So what is the situation in Australia, and is there evidence to support all the hype? Can patients access medicinal cannabis in Australia? The federal government approved medicinal cannabis to treat a limited number of conditions in 2016. While only one product, Sativex, is registered with the Therapeutic Goods Administration, the government allows medical practitioners to apply for a special patient-by-patient permit to prescribe unregistered drugs which have met quality and manufacturing standards, through a process known as the Special Access Scheme B (SASB). Patient interest is strong. A study of GPs conducted last year found that more than two out of five had received a patient request for medicinal cannabis in the preceding three months. Following a streamlining of the SASB process, the number of medicinal cannabis permits approved has rapidly increased over the past year, from 229 in August 2018 to 2,206 in July 2019. As of the end of July, more than 11,000 SASB approvals had been made by the TGA. \u201cIt\u2019s like a hockey stick curve,\u201d says Dr Sanjay Nijhawan, medical director of Cannabis Access Clinics, which has facilitated around one-fifth of all medicinal cannabis permits in Australia. \u201cIt\u2019s on a vertical now.\u201d It isn\u2019t cheap. No medicinal cannabis is currently available on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Sativex, approved to treat multiple sclerosis patients, costs about $745 for a six- to eight-week supply. Other unregistered drugs may be cheaper. Which conditions can it help? While there is high community and media interest in medicinal cannabis, the scientific community is approaching the drug with caution, noting that while there is some evidence to back it in some cases, the strength of the research into cannabis needs improvement. In a review of the science, the TGA found strongest evidence for its use in childhood epilepsy, and limited evidence related to palliative care, MS, chronic pain, and addressing the symptoms of chemotherapy patients. The Australian Medical Association identifies potential use for medical cannabis in such conditions, but while the evidence base is growing, the AMA says, the drug remains \u201cexperimental\u201d. Assoc Prof Vicki Kotsirilos, of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, says: \u201cThe evidence for medicinal cannabis is limited and inconclusive, but there is some evidence that does suggest that there is a role for medicinal cannabis products in a number of health conditions,\u201d in line with those reviewed by the TGA. Is there evidence to support it? In reviewing the research, the RACGP reports that studies show that for young epilepsy sufferers, who had exhausted first-line treatments, one in five patients reported an improvement in quality of life and one in eight found a 50% reduction in seizures. One review of medicinal cannabis use in those suffering chronic pain found that one in 22 patients reported a 30% reduction in pain. Medicinal cannabis comes in different forms and potencies. The cannabis plant contains around 100 cannabinoids, but the ones of particular therapeutic interest are THC (which is the psychoactive compound, used in treatment of conditions such as nausea and muscle spasticity) and cannabidiol (CBD), which has been used in epilepsy treatment. Commercially available drugs can take the form of pills, patches or oils and contain different combinations of THC and CBD. It is due in part to the heterogenous nature of medicinal cannabis products that conclusive research into its effectiveness is limited. AMA president Dr Tony Bartone says that to an extent, the research needs to start from scratch before it can be widely prescribed. \u201cThe concentration, the combination, the constituent composition varies depending on how the drug is manufactured and where the cannabis is grown. Even the soil types impact,\u201d he says. Prof Jennifer Martin, director of the Australian Centre for Cannabinoid Clinical Research and Excellence (ACRE) and researcher at the University of Newcastle, is part of international efforts to develop a solid evidence base. \u201cIf you Google it, there are something like 50 symptoms that people feel medical cannabis is useful for,\u201d she says. \u201cIn terms of what we would call the scientific evidence for drugs getting registered in Australia, there is probably only three or four conditions or symptoms for which we actually have evidence to show comparative efficacy \u2013 that is how much benefit it provides compared to other existing therapies.\u201d Martin says studying medicinal cannabis is difficult, particularly in complex conditions such as chronic pain. \u201cPeople might feel better even though the pain is the same,\u201d she says. In studies which have had a placebo arm, she says, 30 to 50% of people on the placebo reported benefits. But the impact of this effect is not to be discounted. \u201cWe are finding we need to add new benefit measures to our studies when we are trialing the cannabinoids, compared to other drugs \u2013 so we may not just be measuring pain, but also distress, anxiety, quality of life, care-giver burden and all sorts of things which are very important but which haven\u2019t traditionally been used as reasons you may take a new therapy.\u201d Prescribing cannabis is not just about weighing up the evidence, says Kotsirilos, \u201cbut also whether there\u2019s a role in that particular patient\u2019s treatment \u2013 when they\u2019ve tried absolutely everything and they\u2019re still not finding solutions\u201d. \u201cThis is an end-of-the-road decision that\u2019s made between a patient and their doctor,\u201d she says. Can you become addicted? In her capacity as a GP, Kotsirilos has seen medicinal cannabis alleviate symptoms and be well tolerated in patients. But there are unknowns which she is alert to. \u201cThe problem is the long term,\u201d she says. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if it will, in the long term, cause a dependency problem.\u201d Nadia Solowij, a psychology professor at the University of Wollongong who has been publishing cannabis research for decades and is co-director of ACRE, says: \u201cGenerally speaking, it is unlikely that medicinal cannabis used for specific medical conditions would be used sufficiently heavily for dependence or other adverse outcomes to develop, but we don\u2019t yet know.\u201d She says there is less evidence about the risks of developing psychosis. Who\u2019s making money from it? There is significant government and business interest in the growth of the medicinal cannabis industry, with the federal government last week announcing it would prioritise medicinal cannabis licences to projects which have been classed as offering a boost to jobs or exports. The Greens, in their push for legalisation of cannabis for recreation use also, estimate the total legal cannabis market could be worth $3.6bn to the national economy. Research released in May predicted the worldwide market for legal marijuana to be worth US$66.3bn by 2025. Cannabis Access Clinics, a private network of GPs specialising in medicinal cannabis, has facilitated access for around 2,000 patients since opening its doors a year ago. Last year MMJ PhytoTech paid $1m for a 16.7% stake in its parent company, Biologics Research Institute Australia. The service includes bricks and mortar clinics as well as telehealth conferencing. The combined cost for an initial screening, consultation, securing the prescription and a single monthly follow-up consultation is $400. While patients may seek access to medicinal cannabis from any GP, Nijhawan says that a lack of expertise in medicinal cannabis products, an aversion to the amount of paperwork involved in securing access, and the risks associated with prescribing an unregistered drug mean many GPs shy away from the drug. Who is already using it? Patients suffering chronic pain dominate the clinics\u2019 services, says Nijhawan, but another significant cohort is patients with epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, anxiety and anorexia. Asked about the strength of the research on conditions such as anorexia and anxiety, Nijhawan says there is \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d, but concedes more double-blind studies, in which a drug is compared to a placebo, are needed. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of work done in anxiety, there\u2019s a lot of work done in PTSD. We find people\u2019s sleep is better, their appetite is better, their socialising is better, their mobility is better \u2013 pain, anxiety and anything like that are multifactorial.\u201d Nijhawan says that the clinicians in the service emphasise that the first line of treatment for any condition is lifestyle change. Without lifestyle change, medication is unlikely to work. \u201cNever have I told a patient: \u2018Take this and it\u2019s going to cure you.\u2019 It\u2019s just not on.

Last month Gay Star News in the UK went into insolvency after eight years and staff were told just before pay day. It was a similar story: lack of support from business and a side of concern over Brexit.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/gay-star-news-is-closing-you-deserve-the-full-story-all-our-thanks-and-love/\">The founders</a> blamed businesses that were keen to splash their logos with the rainbow flag during pride month, but contributed very little to the LGBTI community in real dollar terms.</p> <h2>Plenty left to fight for</h2> <p>Historically LGBTI media has shone a light and provided a voice for the community that was missing from major media outlets. Star Observer started a year after the Sydney Morning Herald <a href=\"http://www.starobserver.com.au/news/national-news/new-south-wales-news/sydney-morning-herald-apologises-to-mardi-gras-78ers-38-years-after-outing-many-of-them/146334\">published the names</a> of people arrested in the Mardi Gras protest in 1978.</p> <p>But 40 years on, queer media finds itself in a new world where, in many western countries they have traditionally operated in, marriage equality has happened, mainstream media outlets are increasingly reporting on LGBTI issues, and companies are keen to show they support LGBTI people.</p> <p>However, the financial support for community-based LGBTI media is not matching the enthusiasm.</p> <p>This month Andrew Potts was brought back as Star Observer\u2019s editor after seven years during which he worked for Gay Star News as well as DNA magazine. He says there was still a big readership for LGBTI media but it was difficult to monetise.</p> <p>\u201cMagazines like DNA that can charge a cover price and be sold in newsagents don\u2019t face the same challenges, and I think will continue to be successful,\u201d he says. \u201cBut there will always be a need for LGBTI community news.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"da8246e5300639ac98ce69f8aaef87d60ff5c9e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da8246e5300639ac98ce69f8aaef87d60ff5c9e6/0_0_5625_6253/900.jpg\" alt=\"A 2014 Star Observer featuring Kylie Minogue\" width=\"900\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A 2014 Star Observer featuring Kylie Minogue</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is not a case of people going out less, which might affect the advertising for nightclubs and bars, but he says many gay venues are now owned by large corporate entities that may not be as LGBTI focused.</p> <p>David McCarthy, a former Joy president and current host and director, says the financial situation has always been a challenge, but often it\u2019s difficult just getting a foot in the door to find sponsors.</p> <p>\u201cAs often is the case in media, it\u2019s all about network. Increasingly \u2026 advertising and sponsorship is handled by agency, and agencies are notoriously hard to crack,\u201d he says.</p> <p>It isn\u2019t just a financial problem. Elias Jashan, a former Star Observer editor who now lives in the UK, says post-marriage equality queer media in western countries is going through \u201can identity crisis\u201d that is changing the way it covers stories.</p> <p>\u201cI feel like there\u2019s been more of a drive towards celebrity-driven or aggregate-style news than ever before due to intense pressure to compete with better-funded media outlets,\u201d he says. \u201cPerhaps marriage equality has been achieved. But here\u2019s the kicker: there are still many other things we have to fight for before we have full equality and equity.\u201d</p> <h2>Queer media is \u2018a vital service\u2019</h2> <p>Shannon Power, a senior journalist and editor who has worked for Star Observer and Gay Star News, says there is increased pressure for LGBTI publications to churn out content for hits, but at the same time they need to properly represent and write stories for diverse communities.</p> <p>\u201cThe introduction of LGBTI media with a more global focus has resulted in that media becoming more traditional and mainstream,\u201d she says. \u201cThat means there is not as much focus on the \u2018local\u2019 or lesser-known issues.

      "bodyText": "\u201cWe are challenged,\u201d said Joy FM\u2019s president, Melinda Rich, in a memo to staff last week. The community LGBTI radio station in Melbourne has been operating for 25 years and has about 550,000 listeners a month, but last week it let go two of its staff after failing to raise enough money through sponsorship and its latest radiothon. It\u2019s not the end of Joy, and many of its challenges are unique \u2013 it needs to move to the Victorian government\u2019s new pride centre at the end of next year, and replace old equipment \u2013 but many are also common to other LGBTI media organisations. In May, just before its 40th anniversary, Sydney\u2019s Star Observer went into voluntary administration saying advertisers had been slow to pay bills. In stepped City Hub\u2019s founder, Lawrence Gibbons, in June to rescue the monthly print and online publication under a new company, Out Publications. But others have not been so lucky. Last month Gay Star News in the UK went into insolvency after eight years and staff were told just before pay day. It was a similar story: lack of support from business and a side of concern over Brexit. The founders blamed businesses that were keen to splash their logos with the rainbow flag during pride month, but contributed very little to the LGBTI community in real dollar terms. Plenty left to fight for Historically LGBTI media has shone a light and provided a voice for the community that was missing from major media outlets. Star Observer started a year after the Sydney Morning Herald published the names of people arrested in the Mardi Gras protest in 1978. But 40 years on, queer media finds itself in a new world where, in many western countries they have traditionally operated in, marriage equality has happened, mainstream media outlets are increasingly reporting on LGBTI issues, and companies are keen to show they support LGBTI people. However, the financial support for community-based LGBTI media is not matching the enthusiasm. This month Andrew Potts was brought back as Star Observer\u2019s editor after seven years during which he worked for Gay Star News as well as DNA magazine. He says there was still a big readership for LGBTI media but it was difficult to monetise. \u201cMagazines like DNA that can charge a cover price and be sold in newsagents don\u2019t face the same challenges, and I think will continue to be successful,\u201d he says. \u201cBut there will always be a need for LGBTI community news.\u201d It is not a case of people going out less, which might affect the advertising for nightclubs and bars, but he says many gay venues are now owned by large corporate entities that may not be as LGBTI focused. David McCarthy, a former Joy president and current host and director, says the financial situation has always been a challenge, but often it\u2019s difficult just getting a foot in the door to find sponsors. \u201cAs often is the case in media, it\u2019s all about network. Increasingly \u2026 advertising and sponsorship is handled by agency, and agencies are notoriously hard to crack,\u201d he says. It isn\u2019t just a financial problem. Elias Jashan, a former Star Observer editor who now lives in the UK, says post-marriage equality queer media in western countries is going through \u201can identity crisis\u201d that is changing the way it covers stories. \u201cI feel like there\u2019s been more of a drive towards celebrity-driven or aggregate-style news than ever before due to intense pressure to compete with better-funded media outlets,\u201d he says. \u201cPerhaps marriage equality has been achieved. But here\u2019s the kicker: there are still many other things we have to fight for before we have full equality and equity.\u201d Queer media is \u2018a vital service\u2019 Shannon Power, a senior journalist and editor who has worked for Star Observer and Gay Star News, says there is increased pressure for LGBTI publications to churn out content for hits, but at the same time they need to properly represent and write stories for diverse communities. \u201cThe introduction of LGBTI media with a more global focus has resulted in that media becoming more traditional and mainstream,\u201d she says. \u201cThat means there is not as much focus on the \u2018local\u2019 or lesser-known issues. LGBTI media has lost focus on the niches within the community and now provides a more general news service to LGBTI people.\u201d Marriage equality is not the end of discrimination, Power says, pointing to the recent attack on a lesbian couple on a bus in the UK, but the perceived increasing acceptance of LGBTI people and their representation in mainstream media does not mean the community does not need LGBTI media, Power says. \u201cThe reality is nothing could be further from the truth.\u201d The postal survey and marriage equality campaign brought in big support from corporate sponsors, readers and listeners, but that was an easier pitch for advertising than ongoing support. \u201cDuring marriage equality we got a lot more support and a lot more listeners,\u201d McCarthy says. \u201cCorporates want to support but you\u2019ve got to make a pitch that works for them.\u201d In Australia, the looming fight over the right for religious people to express anti-LGBTI views without repercussions, and the right for religious organisations to fire or refuse to hire LGBTI people, means giving LGBTI people a voice in the debate is more important than ever, McCarthy says. Potts says that when he first worked at Star Observer news of LGBTI hate crimes would \u201cliterally arrive bleeding\u201d from the streets, something thankfully rarer in 2019. Marriage equality went mainstream, he says, leaving LGBTI media to pick up issues not as well covered by mainstream media. \u201cFor the more marginalised members of our community, such as transgender and intersex people or polyamorous people who are yet to be embraced by the mainstream media, we continue to print their news,\u201d he says. This week One Nation\u2019s leader in NSW, Mark Latham, launched a booklet to be sent to parent groups in schools warning against the teaching of \u201cradical gender theory\u201d. In the Sydney Morning Herald this was reported as Latham sending \u201canti-PC packs\u201d. Star Observer reported the packs as \u201canti-trans propaganda\u201d and highlighted the high suicide rate for young trans people, as well as detail on the programs actually offered in schools. A freelance Australian LGBTI journalist, Jesse Jones, says LGBTI media covers stories differently from the mainstream, and it shows. \u201cWe\u2019re the ones who are best placed to get it right ... You see so many articles about trans issues, for example, obviously written by a cis person with no familiarity, that can be anywhere from ignorant to outrageously offensive,\u201d he says. Power says mainstream media reporting more on LGBTI issues does not mean they are doing a better job of it than LGBTI publications. \u201cWhen you consume stories in LGBTI media you can be certain the people who created that story are passionate about the issues they\u2019re reporting on,\u201d Power says. \u201cWe don\u2019t work in niche media for the money or glory. They don\u2019t exist for LGBTI journalists. We do it because we know we are providing a vital service and are agents of affecting change.\u201d",

He says conservative estimates suggest building a NuScale plant in Australia would cost $7m per megawatt, or $420m for a single module. Analysts say this is significantly more what it would cost to build a new coal-fired power plant, and new coal is considered commercially unviable next to renewable energy backed by storage.</p> <p>On what policy settings would be needed to make nuclear generation competitive, Irwin says: \u201cWhat we believe is that all low-emissions technology should be treated the same.\u201d</p> <p>Given the question mark over cost, the case for bringing nuclear into the Australian grid largely turns on the need for \u201cdispatchable\u201d power, which is sometimes mislabelled as \u201cbaseload\u201d, as coal is phased out.

He considers Irwin\u2019s outlook overly optimistic on a number of fronts, not least construction costs, which are routinely significantly higher in the Australian than in the US.</p> <p>He says the arguments against nuclear power in Australia at the moment are clear: it missed the boat in the 20th century, is too expensive and slow to be built, and newer technologies are the better part of a decade away from being demonstrated. \u201cThey will only be available from the 2030s if everything goes right, something nobody should assume will happen given previous delays,\u201d he says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jun/18/australians-support-for-nuclear-plants-rising-but-most-dont-want-to-live-near-one\">Australians' support for nuclear plants rising \u2013 but most don't want to live near one</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Holmes \u00e0 Court does not completely dismiss the possibility of an eventual nuclear power industry, but believes there is no case for the current parliamentary inquiry beyond short-term politics.</p> <p>\u201cWe already know that existing nuclear technology is uncompetitive and new nuclear technologies are far from ready,\u201d he says. \u201cIf and when the industry develops a product that is cheap, safe, flexible and fast to build, I think it will be worth having a national discussion about removing the ban.</p> <p>\u201cUntil then, this is just a political inquiry to satisfy a few on the backbench, not an energy inquiry.

He says some have expressed an interest, but declines to name them. On cost, Irwin says existing estimates are either out-of-date or wildly inaccurate. He says conservative estimates suggest building a NuScale plant in Australia would cost $7m per megawatt, or $420m for a single module. Analysts say this is significantly more what it would cost to build a new coal-fired power plant, and new coal is considered commercially unviable next to renewable energy backed by storage. On what policy settings would be needed to make nuclear generation competitive, Irwin says: \u201cWhat we believe is that all low-emissions technology should be treated the same.\u201d Given the question mark over cost, the case for bringing nuclear into the Australian grid largely turns on the need for \u201cdispatchable\u201d power, which is sometimes mislabelled as \u201cbaseload\u201d, as coal is phased out. Irwin says there are only four realistic options for low-emissions electricity \u2013 solar, wind, hydro and nuclear \u2013 and nuclear is \u201cthe only one not dependent on the weather\u201d. Simon Holmes \u00e0 Court, a senior adviser at the University of Melbourne\u2019s climate and energy college, says this argument ignores the large amounts of dispatchable generation available from hydro, gas, bioenergy, demand response and storage. He considers Irwin\u2019s outlook overly optimistic on a number of fronts, not least construction costs, which are routinely significantly higher in the Australian than in the US. He says the arguments against nuclear power in Australia at the moment are clear: it missed the boat in the 20th century, is too expensive and slow to be built, and newer technologies are the better part of a decade away from being demonstrated. \u201cThey will only be available from the 2030s if everything goes right, something nobody should assume will happen given previous delays,\u201d he says. Holmes \u00e0 Court does not completely dismiss the possibility of an eventual nuclear power industry, but believes there is no case for the current parliamentary inquiry beyond short-term politics. \u201cWe already know that existing nuclear technology is uncompetitive and new nuclear technologies are far from ready,\u201d he says. \u201cIf and when the industry develops a product that is cheap, safe, flexible and fast to build, I think it will be worth having a national discussion about removing the ban. \u201cUntil then, this is just a political inquiry to satisfy a few on the backbench, not an energy inquiry. Australia has energy experts coming out the wazoo that are so much better placed to keep a watching brief on this than a rabble of energy illiterate MPs.\u201d Holmes \u00e0 Court says the ideal time for the next expert study is after a commercial next-generation reactor comes online, probably late next decade. Taylor says he does not have all the answers but the government needs to plan for the long-term. The inquiry by the standing committee on the environment and energy is due to report back within four months.",

Or is there a darker game behind all the vitriol? The issue that\u2019s sparked the latest public mauling by News Corp\u2019s Daily Tele and shock jock Alan Jones is a planning department recommendation two weeks ago that the 237m high proposed Ritz Carlton hotel at the Star casino in Pyrmont be rejected. The $500m project is still to go to the Independent Planning Commission for a decision. But as communities who have opposed coalmines in the Hunter can bitterly attest, the IPC rarely overturns the department\u2019s recommendation. What\u2019s riled up the Tele and Jones is that the planning and public spaces minister, Rob Stokes, had the temerity to say the department\u2019s assessment \u201creflects the consistent and widespread opposition to the scale of this proposal\u201d. Jones has called Stokes \u201cdelinquent\u201d and called for his sacking. The Telegraph has run a series of prominent stories with headlines such as: \u201cRobbing the Ritz: Stokes hits the panic button with secret phone call.\u201d It\u2019s run a feature about how Sydney needs a new hotel and how the development lobby think it\u2019s time for Pyrmont \u2013 a historic suburb of old warehouses, terraces and public housing once home to dock workers \u2013 to be developed. The developer group Urban Task Force to the Transport and Tourism Forum, representing infrastructure construction companies, have chimed in, providing an echo chamber of pro-development support. So let\u2019s go with the simple theory first: Star is really angry because it thought it had this one in the bag. The Tele is running the Star\u2019s arguments prominently because the Star is a big advertiser in the tabloid. Jones is on board because he generally supports development, and then there\u2019s the old rugby fraternity. The chairman of the Star, John O\u2019Neill, was chairman of the Rugby Union and Jones was once the coach of the Wallabies. O\u2019Neill once sued Jones but sources say they are on better terms now. Perhaps Star\u2019s media guy, Peter Jenkins, a former rugby union writer, played a role in patching up relations. Then there are the billions of gambling dollars at stake. The Star needs this five-star hotel to compete with Crown Resorts, whose 271m six-star high-roller casino, hotel and apartment building is rising at Barangaroo and due for completion in 2021. High rollers won\u2019t travel across Pyrmont bay to gamble if they are staying at Crown or a city hotel, so not having equivalent digs would be very bad for the Star.

Then there are the darker theories about what\u2019s driving the attacks on Stokes, who is widely seen as one of two among the senior figures in the moderates who could succeed Gladys Berejiklian. According to several insiders within the moderate faction, a deal was struck before the last election for an orderly transition of the leadership some time in the middle of this term. The theory goes that moderate convener Matt Kean has agreed to support right winger and treasurer, Dominic Perrottet, for premier in exchange for becoming his deputy. Perrottet would be divisive even among the right. He\u2019s very socially conservative \u2013 he opposed legalising abortion in NSW, declaring he could not support laws that stopped \u201cthe beating heart of an unborn child\u201d \u2013 and he\u2019s an economic dry.

There are at least two moderate frontbenchers who would lay claim to the leadership: the transport minister, Andrew Constance, and Stokes. So, let\u2019s come back to the Star and its $500m project. Is the Tele taking aim at Stokes as it seeks to be the kingmaker in a forthcoming battle for the premier\u2019s job? You be the judge. Here\u2019s what the Telegraph reported the day after Stokes announced his department had recommended against the Star. \u201cA split has formed in the Berejiklian cabinet over the planning department\u2019s sensational rejection of a $500m Ritz Carlton tower at Pyrmont, amid concerns it signals a U-turn on city development.\u201d Treasurer Dominic Perrottet went on radio yesterday morning to lay the foundations for the premier or the government to walk back the position. \u201cI would obviously like to see the development go ahead,\u201d he said.

      "bodyText": "Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r is looking for a massive impact from Harry Maguire as the England centre-back joins his new-look Manchester United side. The Norwegian says he decided to target Maguire after he impressed in United\u2019s 1-0 win at Leicester on 3 February. Fast-forward to Chelsea\u2019s visit on Sunday for the season opener and after an \u00a380m payment to Leicester, Maguire is expected to be in the XI and start his role as the key man in the new Solskj\u00e6r project. The manager has had half a year in charge but wants to be judged from now on, having just completed a first close season when a rebuild took place, with Maguire\u2019s recruitment pivotal. \u201cI\u2019m delighted we have got Harry in because he\u2019s going to be great for this club,\u201d says Solskj\u00e6r. \u201cHe was always my number-one target. Of course it took some time but it does occasionally. I more or less made my mind up when we played Leicester that if it was possible to get him we should get him or at least try to. He is so composed on the ball and gives the team another dimension.\u201d Since Sir Alex Ferguson stepped down in May 2013 United have struggled for on-field leaders. Maguire, again, can help solve the issue. \u201cHe has already shown what a presence he will be,\u201d says Solskj\u00e6r. \u201cHe\u2019s a leader, an established international, a goal threat and a very good defender \u2013 but also a very composed ball player.\u201d The obvious comparison is with the successful \u00a375m investment Liverpool made when buying Virgil van Dijk from Southampton in January 2018. \u201cI don\u2019t want to compare us,\u201d says Solskj\u00e6r. \u201cBut I know Harry is going to have a massive impact on us.\u201d Since Ferguson left the club as champions United have struggled, finishing seventh, fourth, fifth, sixth, second and sixth. Yet despite Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s 2019-20 vintage appearing to have scant chance of challenging for the title, he is upbeat. \u201cLet\u2019s make sure that we surprise a few people,\u201d the manager says. \u201cWe haven\u2019t challenged properly these six years so it\u2019s not where we want to be. But I feel we are on the right track and feel we have a better squad, better team and better foundation this season to improve.\u201d Maguire is joined by Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Daniel James as Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s other recruits. While James, a \u00a315m buy from Swansea, may not be alongside Maguire in the starting XI there will be surprise if Wan-Bissaka, who cost \u00a345m from Crystal Palace, is on the bench. Instead a defence that reads David De Gea, Wan-Bissaka, Maguire, Victor Lindel\u00f6f and Luke Shaw should take the field in what looks an upgrade on recent rearguards, even if the last of these can still underwhelm. Solskj\u00e6r does look at least a midfielder light following the departures of Ander Herrera and Marouane Fellaini, though the 22-year-old Scott McTominay is another of the younger talents in whom Solskj\u00e6r intends to trust. As well as McTominay there are James, Wan-Bissaka, Marcus Rashford (all 21), Anthony Martial (23), Shaw (24) and the 17-year-old forward Mason Greenwood \u2013 who may be a substitute against Chelsea \u2013 in the manager\u2019s youthful core. He sees no risk in this. \u201cYou can call it a gamble.

A YouGov poll of more than 1,200 voters in 20 seats to be fought between the Lib Dems and the Tories found a 14.1 percentage-point slump in Conservative support and an overall swing of more than eight points to the Lib Dems compared with the 2017 election. The polling, commissioned by the People\u2019s Vote campaign for a second referendum, covered constituencies with the smallest Conservative majorities where the Lib Dems came second in 2017. Cheltenham, Richmond Park, Wells and Hazel Grove in Manchester would be among the seats to fall. Peter Kellner, past president of YouGov and a People\u2019s Vote supporter, said: \u201cThis polling shows that, in the battleground seats, Boris Johnson\u2019s hard line on Brexit is far from a deal sealer in any early election. Even before a campaign has begun the Lib Dems could expect to benefit from enhanced coverage, and their tactical voting message will almost certainly gain traction. Jo Swinson\u2019s party is well placed to make significant gains at the Tories\u2019 expense.\u201d",

In a new Hope Not Hate poll, many more \u2013 60% \u2013 agree a no-deal Brexit will accelerate the demand for independence. Only 15% disagree.</p> <p>What is most worrying is not just that so many think the union will end but how at least for now so few appear to care. Only 30% of British Conservatives (and only 14% of Brexit party voters) would oppose Brexit if it meant the break-up of the union: 56% of Tories (and 78% of Brexit party voters) \u2013 in total 70% of Leavers \u2013 would go ahead regardless, even if the union collapsed.</p> <p>Three weeks into the Johnson premiership, English nationalism is on the rise, the Conservative and Unionist party has been reincarnated as the Conservative and Brexit party, unionism appears to be sleepwalking into oblivion and the UK, once admired around the world for an understated but comfortably unifying Britishness that was inclusive, outward-looking, tolerant and ultimately pragmatic, now presents an ugly picture: of bitter division, intolerance and introversion so extreme that it has sacrificed common sense in favour of a dogmatic abandonment of its own best interests.</p> <p>Incoming governments normally announce that they will seek to serve the whole electorate. Now, playing out in triplicate across the UK is a \u201cdivide and rule\u201d approach to leadership, straight from Donald Trump\u2019s playbook: each faction consolidating its base, choosing an enemy and accusing opponents of treason in the hope that in a multiparty system they can win with a minority of votes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2eef5afadfcbedd5fde4d380ed274b939265a852\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2eef5afadfcbedd5fde4d380ed274b939265a852/0_16_1616_970/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dominic Cummings, special adviser to Boris Johnson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dominic Cummings, special adviser to Boris Johnson, depicts the House of Commons as the enemy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>True to form, Johnson adviser<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/09/dominic-cummings-boris-johnson-brexit\" title=\"\"> Dominic Cummings</a> depicts the House of Commons as the enemy in a \u201cpeople v parliament\u201d election, with the people led to believe \u2013 by a costly public information campaign that is nothing more than Brexit propaganda \u2013 that their parliament is prepared to betray democracy and abandon traditional national values. Next, the Tories will likely embrace <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/lynton-crosby\" title=\"\">Lynton Crosby</a>\u2019s well-honed election strategy: to whip up English nationalism by demonising immigrants as well as perfidious Europeans and playing the Scottish card he so successfully deployed in 2015, with the spectre of a minority Labour government controlled by an even smaller minority of Scots.</p> <p>As this hardline nationalism tightens its grip, there is much worse to come: Johnson joining Nigel Farage in insisting that a no-deal Brexit on 31 October is the only true expression of patriotism; trade wars putting English and Scottish businesses and jobs in jeopardy; Scottish separatists not just threatening to leave every institution of the UK but planning for a no-deal exit too; a rerun of the old pressures for an Irish unification poll; and England being pushed towards a self-regarding xenophobia.</p> <p>The SNP is already peddling what it claims is a progressive, pro-European Scottish nationalism that must break free from Johnson\u2019s reactionary, anti-European and anti-Scottish English nationalism \u2013 and the inescapable conclusion that only thus can Scotland regain its dignity. But if the UK pound, the UK customs union and the UK single market all go, this desire for hard \u2013 not soft \u2013 separatism ignores the hundreds of thousands of jobs at risk of going too.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s role should be to stand up for Britain\u2019s true economic interests but a few days ago its shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/07/scottish-national-party-independence-john-mcdonnell-labour\" title=\"\">fell straight into the nationalist trap</a>, suggesting a Scottish parliament should not be frustrated by what he called the \u201cEnglish parliament\u201d.</p> <p>Unionist parties in Northern Ireland should have been persuaded that their stated objectives \u2013 the integrity of the UK and an open border with the Irish Republic \u2013 could be best secured by continued membership of the customs union and single market.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e15888dd64b4c1875e62c2a9b478e78711333b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e15888dd64b4c1875e62c2a9b478e78711333b2/73_74_2162_1297/1000.jpg\" alt=\"DUP leader Arlene Foster, right, pictured with the party\u2019s deputy leader Nigel Dodds\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">DUP leader Arlene Foster, right, pictured with the party\u2019s deputy leader Nigel Dodds following a meeting with Boris Johnson in Belfast on 31 July 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Liam McBurney/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Such an outcome would have better reflected the dominant pro-European vote of Northern Ireland\u2019s electors. But the DUP has convinced itself that its stance on Europe has to be couched in purely nationalist terms \u2013 as a test not of what\u2019s best economically for Northern Ireland but of whether a diehard brand of nationalism will prevail. </p> <p>As the Second World War ended, George Orwell made a distinction between patriots who instinctively love their country and the opposite, a political nationalism that he defined as \u201cpower hunger tempered by self-deception\u201d. He noted its defining features: unreality about the country\u2019s prospects; introversion bordering on the xenophobic; and hate-filled obsessiveness that treats people solely in terms of their loyalty and utility. Orwell argued passionately that the descent into a narrow, chauvinistic nationalism could be halted only by what he called \u201cmoral effort\u201d.</p> <p>In our times, this means we must rediscover the age-old virtues of empathy, solidarity across borders, reciprocity between nations and co-operation rather than conflict. These precious ideals \u2013 and a tolerant, inclusive and outward-looking Britishness \u2013 could not survive the divisiveness and chaos of a no-deal Brexit. To prevent the rise of dysfunctional nationalism, the first step is to stop no deal in its tracks.</p>",

His soundbites, pledging token sums for the NHS and 20,000 more police on the street at some future date, cannot disguise a government driven not by the national interest but by a destructive, populist, nationalist ideology. And with Scottish nationalists pushing a more extreme form of separation and Northern Ireland\u2019s unionists becoming, paradoxically, Northern Irish nationalists \u2013 digging in, even if it means, against all economic logic, a hard border with the Irish Republic \u2013 we are, at best, only a precariously united kingdom. Johnson\u2019s flying visits to all corners of the UK have done nothing to dispel the impression that under him the world\u2019s most successful multinational state is devoid of a unifying purpose powerful enough to hold it together and to keep four nationalisms \u2013 Scottish, Irish, English and also a rising Welsh nationalism \u2013 at bay. Recent polling shows a majority of Scots support Scottish independence. In a new Hope Not Hate poll, many more \u2013 60% \u2013 agree a no-deal Brexit will accelerate the demand for independence. Only 15% disagree. What is most worrying is not just that so many think the union will end but how at least for now so few appear to care. Only 30% of British Conservatives (and only 14% of Brexit party voters) would oppose Brexit if it meant the break-up of the union: 56% of Tories (and 78% of Brexit party voters) \u2013 in total 70% of Leavers \u2013 would go ahead regardless, even if the union collapsed. Three weeks into the Johnson premiership, English nationalism is on the rise, the Conservative and Unionist party has been reincarnated as the Conservative and Brexit party, unionism appears to be sleepwalking into oblivion and the UK, once admired around the world for an understated but comfortably unifying Britishness that was inclusive, outward-looking, tolerant and ultimately pragmatic, now presents an ugly picture: of bitter division, intolerance and introversion so extreme that it has sacrificed common sense in favour of a dogmatic abandonment of its own best interests. Incoming governments normally announce that they will seek to serve the whole electorate. Now, playing out in triplicate across the UK is a \u201cdivide and rule\u201d approach to leadership, straight from Donald Trump\u2019s playbook: each faction consolidating its base, choosing an enemy and accusing opponents of treason in the hope that in a multiparty system they can win with a minority of votes. True to form, Johnson adviser Dominic Cummings depicts the House of Commons as the enemy in a \u201cpeople v parliament\u201d election, with the people led to believe \u2013 by a costly public information campaign that is nothing more than Brexit propaganda \u2013 that their parliament is prepared to betray democracy and abandon traditional national values. Next, the Tories will likely embrace Lynton Crosby\u2019s well-honed election strategy: to whip up English nationalism by demonising immigrants as well as perfidious Europeans and playing the Scottish card he so successfully deployed in 2015, with the spectre of a minority Labour government controlled by an even smaller minority of Scots. As this hardline nationalism tightens its grip, there is much worse to come: Johnson joining Nigel Farage in insisting that a no-deal Brexit on 31 October is the only true expression of patriotism; trade wars putting English and Scottish businesses and jobs in jeopardy; Scottish separatists not just threatening to leave every institution of the UK but planning for a no-deal exit too; a rerun of the old pressures for an Irish unification poll; and England being pushed towards a self-regarding xenophobia. The SNP is already peddling what it claims is a progressive, pro-European Scottish nationalism that must break free from Johnson\u2019s reactionary, anti-European and anti-Scottish English nationalism \u2013 and the inescapable conclusion that only thus can Scotland regain its dignity. But if the UK pound, the UK customs union and the UK single market all go, this desire for hard \u2013 not soft \u2013 separatism ignores the hundreds of thousands of jobs at risk of going too. Labour\u2019s role should be to stand up for Britain\u2019s true economic interests but a few days ago its shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, also fell straight into the nationalist trap, suggesting a Scottish parliament should not be frustrated by what he called the \u201cEnglish parliament\u201d. Unionist parties in Northern Ireland should have been persuaded that their stated objectives \u2013 the integrity of the UK and an open border with the Irish Republic \u2013 could be best secured by continued membership of the customs union and single market. Such an outcome would have better reflected the dominant pro-European vote of Northern Ireland\u2019s electors. But the DUP has convinced itself that its stance on Europe has to be couched in purely nationalist terms \u2013 as a test not of what\u2019s best economically for Northern Ireland but of whether a diehard brand of nationalism will prevail. As the Second World War ended, George Orwell made a distinction between patriots who instinctively love their country and the opposite, a political nationalism that he defined as \u201cpower hunger tempered by self-deception\u201d. He noted its defining features: unreality about the country\u2019s prospects; introversion bordering on the xenophobic; and hate-filled obsessiveness that treats people solely in terms of their loyalty and utility. Orwell argued passionately that the descent into a narrow, chauvinistic nationalism could be halted only by what he called \u201cmoral effort\u201d. In our times, this means we must rediscover the age-old virtues of empathy, solidarity across borders, reciprocity between nations and co-operation rather than conflict. These precious ideals \u2013 and a tolerant, inclusive and outward-looking Britishness \u2013 could not survive the divisiveness and chaos of a no-deal Brexit. To prevent the rise of dysfunctional nationalism, the first step is to stop no deal in its tracks.",

But this act has been particularly ugly. Brexit has been created and driven almost entirely by internal UK politics, and the majority of the resolution of Brexit lies within the UK. Can accommodation be reached? It is certainly possible \u2013 indeed, the shape of the withdrawal agreement is reasonable, if messy. Are there enough intelligent, wise people in Berlin, Brussels, Dublin, London and Paris? Certainly, yes.

If it is averted, it is likely that it won\u2019t be until the last minute. By that point, consumers will go into a panic and start stockpiling food, businesses reliant on EU trade will start ramping up the pressure and may even strike to demonstrate their frustration, and I think the UK will see the biggest demonstrations in its history.

An election on the back of a successful deal could pave the way to a handsome win for Johnson. However, no-deal, supported by only 38% while 50% oppose, looks a more likely outcome. Against this backdrop, another hung parliament seems a good bet.</p> <p>The nation is gloomy: 60% feel pessimistic about the year ahead. The country has never felt more divided, and our politicians have never felt less able to manage the task ahead. Some 74% believe that \u201cour politics is no longer fit for purpose\u201d.

What has fundamentally changed is that the previous prime minister voted Remain and her heart was never really in leaving the EU \u2013 she saw Brexit as a damage-limitation exercise rather than the great opportunity it actually is.</p> <p>By contrast, Boris Johnson voted to leave, campaigned to leave, and has staked his political future on our leaving by 31 October \u201ccome hell or high water\u201d.</p> <p>Furthermore, he has formed a so-called \u201cwar cabinet\u201d of people who are committed to the Brexit project and will help drive it over the line.</p> <p>Given the events of the last three years, I expect the remaniacs in parliament to fight some desperate rearguard action to overturn the democratic wishes of the British people \u2013 but I believe they will fail and we will, therefore, leave on time, at Halloween, and I look forward to seeing the sunrise over a free country on the morning of the first of November.</p> <h2>The political adviser<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"165af9b9edea2ac1cc67d5b4ce51ff93b53aa10d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/165af9b9edea2ac1cc67d5b4ce51ff93b53aa10d/855_0_2765_3456/800.jpg\" alt=\"Joey Jones\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Joey Jones, </strong><strong>strategic </strong><strong>counsel at Cicero Group and former spokesperson for Theresa May</strong></p> <p>In the next couple of months, the Conservatives will try to win a general election and manage no deal simultaneously.

In October, Boris Johnson will bounce like a pinball between Cobra meetings marshalling the portaloos on the M20, getting the lifesaving drugs through customs, keeping the shelves stacked and stump speeches, walkabouts, rosettes, banners, selfies and baby photos. It is bonkers. If he pulls it off, Dominic Cummings will truly deserve his status of \u201cthe special one\u201d of British politics.</p> <p>But I think something will have to give. The resurgent Lib Dems and ever-formidable SNP will eat away at Tory seats, and Labour, despite its Brexit incoherence, will refuse to collapse. So what then? Well call me a gloomster, a doomster, but I perceive a newly configured, more complex but still paralysed parliament. And having burned our bridges with the rest of the EU, British negotiators will return to Brussels looking for a trade deal. Have fun with that! At the end of 2019 we will raise a glass to more EU-related fun and frolics, safe in the knowledge that Brexit is for life, not just for Christmas.</p>",

An election on the back of a successful deal could pave the way to a handsome win for Johnson. However, no-deal, supported by only 38% while 50% oppose, looks a more likely outcome. Against this backdrop, another hung parliament seems a good bet. The nation is gloomy: 60% feel pessimistic about the year ahead. The country has never felt more divided, and our politicians have never felt less able to manage the task ahead. Some 74% believe that \u201cour politics is no longer fit for purpose\u201d. The months ahead may well prove them right. The Brexiter Mark Francois, vice-chair of the European Research Group I believe it is now increasingly likely that we will leave the European Union at Halloween. What has fundamentally changed is that the previous prime minister voted Remain and her heart was never really in leaving the EU \u2013 she saw Brexit as a damage-limitation exercise rather than the great opportunity it actually is. By contrast, Boris Johnson voted to leave, campaigned to leave, and has staked his political future on our leaving by 31 October \u201ccome hell or high water\u201d. Furthermore, he has formed a so-called \u201cwar cabinet\u201d of people who are committed to the Brexit project and will help drive it over the line. Given the events of the last three years, I expect the remaniacs in parliament to fight some desperate rearguard action to overturn the democratic wishes of the British people \u2013 but I believe they will fail and we will, therefore, leave on time, at Halloween, and I look forward to seeing the sunrise over a free country on the morning of the first of November. The political adviser Joey Jones, strategic counsel at Cicero Group and former spokesperson for Theresa May In the next couple of months, the Conservatives will try to win a general election and manage no deal simultaneously. Just think about that for a moment. In October, Boris Johnson will bounce like a pinball between Cobra meetings marshalling the portaloos on the M20, getting the lifesaving drugs through customs, keeping the shelves stacked and stump speeches, walkabouts, rosettes, banners, selfies and baby photos. It is bonkers. If he pulls it off, Dominic Cummings will truly deserve his status of \u201cthe special one\u201d of British politics. But I think something will have to give. The resurgent Lib Dems and ever-formidable SNP will eat away at Tory seats, and Labour, despite its Brexit incoherence, will refuse to collapse. So what then? Well call me a gloomster, a doomster, but I perceive a newly configured, more complex but still paralysed parliament. And having burned our bridges with the rest of the EU, British negotiators will return to Brussels looking for a trade deal. Have fun with that! At the end of 2019 we will raise a glass to more EU-related fun and frolics, safe in the knowledge that Brexit is for life, not just for Christmas.",

      "bodyText": "More major raids aimed at picking up undocumented immigrants are likely soon despite a flood of outrage at a huge operation last week that saw more than 600 Latino workers detained at poultry plants in Mississippi. Donald Trump\u2019s White House has ordered US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents to identify more targets across the country, according to a report by CNN. The network said the raids would be specifically aimed at workplaces, just like those in Mississippi. The fears come as the president described the workplace raids as a \u201cvery good deterrent\u201d for undocumented immigrants. Trump has made curbing immigration a key theme of his presidency and a core issue for his 2020 re-election campaign but has been widely condemned for using racist language in describing immigration. The order also comes days after the man accused of killing 22 people in El Paso, Texas, confessed he was targeting \u201cMexicans\u201d and allegedly posted an online manifesto just before the shooting that contained anti-immigration language that echoed Trump\u2019s own rhetoric. The Mississippi raids triggered a slew of news reports and images of traumatized children bewildered by the abrupt loss of mothers, fathers and caregivers as their family members were picked up in a raid that coincided with the start of the new school year. Dozens of children were picked up from local schools and taken to shelters, including a local gym, where they were looked after by volunteers. \u201cGovernment, please show some heart,\u201d begged an 11-year-old girl whose father was detained. Asked why there was no better plan to care for the children, Trump told reporters on Friday: \u201cYou have to go in, you can\u2019t let anybody know. \u201cOtherwise when you get there, nobody will be there,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut a big factor is to let people outside of the country that want to come in legally.\u201d Social media lit up with polarizing views in support of, and strongly against the action. Many Democrats condemned the raids and spoke in support of the families hit by them. The Vermont senator Bernie Sanders said the Ice raids were \u201cevil\u201d.

He was joined by 2020 frontrunner Joe Biden, who said they were aimed at \u201cstoking fear\u201d. But many Mississippi state legislators expressed their support for Ice\u2019s actions. Mississippi\u2019s lieutenant governor, Tate Reeves, tweeted: \u201cGlad to see that ICE is working hard to enforce our immigration laws. 680 aliens detained in Mississippi today. We must enforce our laws, for the safety of all Americans.\u201d As the administration orders new detentions, putting Latino communities across the US on edge, there appears to be little appetite to match the actions with prosecutions of the employers who actually hire them to do often tough manual work for low pay. According to Ice figures obtained by the Washington Post, there has been a 300% increase in investigations between the 2017 and 2018, while the number of managers arrested has doubled. But a database maintained by Duke University and the University of Virginia found that just five companies have been prosecuted since Trump took office, compared to 88 prosecutions during the Obama administration between 2009 and 2016. A separate study by Syracuse University found that no companies were prosecuted for knowingly hiring undocumented workers between April 2018 and March 2019. In a letter to the attorney general, William Barr, and the acting secretary of homeland security, Kevin McAleenan, this week, leading Democratic members of Congress demanded documents showing whether the companies involved in the Mississippi raids would now face criminal charges or fines. \u201cIt appears that these DoJ and Ice enforcement actions are targeting only immigrant workers and not their employers,\u201d said the letter, signed by House oversight committee members Elijah Cummings, Bennie Thompson and Jamie Raskin. The Mississippi raid came after repeated warnings by Trump that Ice was set to step up its operations. In June, Trump publicly warned of expanded Ice operations, prompting immigrant advocates to increase education for migrants on their rights. Five days later, Trump announced the raids would be delayed. But a month later, US immigration officials again warned that raids targeting thousands of families would take place in major cities across the US, including major cities such as Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, New York and Denver. But despite the increased action, the Trump administration\u2019s deportations have not matched those under Barack Obama. In the last fiscal year, Ice removed 250,000 undocumented migrants, compared with 410,000 removed in 2012.",

Tottenham Hotspur have missed them madly, as well ... on account of having won nine of their last ten games against them.</p> <p><strong>History may only provide so much of a guide, though, because both teams have moved on since we last saw them.</strong> Spurs, unchanged for a couple of transfer windows, could finally shoogle things up this evening by giving their new signings Tanguy Ndombele and Giovani Lo Celso a debut at their fancy new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. They\u2019ll also be without the injured Dele Alli and the suspended Heung-min Son. And will they suffer a hangover from the bitter disappointment of Madrid? Ah, variables, old friend, it\u2019s been a while round these parts.</p> <p><strong>Villa meanwhile have gone to town in the transfer market since reclaiming their top-flight status in the play-off final against Derby. </strong>Eleven new signings! Trezeguet and Wesley are the big hopes up front; Tyrone Mings and Matt Targett have been secured at the back. But perhaps most importantly, they\u2019ve managed to keep hold of Jack Grealish during the Championship years, and now have a midfielder beginning to realise his vast potential. Dean Smith has promised his side will go for it this season; consolidation is not their only goal.</p> <p><strong>So both sets of fans have plenty to get excited about. </strong>Spurs - long established now as one of the best teams in Europe - are naturally big favourites against a newly promoted team that will need time to gel. But Villa have won their last three opening fixtures in the Premier League - at Arsenal, Stoke and Bournemouth - and will treat this match as a free shot. With so many new faces likely to be on show, it\u2019s sure to be fascinating. Here\u2019s to exciting and dramatic as well. It\u2019s on!</p> <p><strong>Kick off:</strong> 5.30pm BST.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-10T15:33:04.827Z\">at 4.33pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Paul MacInnes was our man at the match. Here\u2019s his report, hot off the press. Thanks for reading this MBM. Villa were probably the better side in the first half. But they sat back after that, and Spurs were definitely the better side in the second. A deserved win in the end, though Spurs had to graft for it. A harsh lesson for the Premier League new boys, who will surely take heart from a brave display once the sting of defeat subsides. Meanwhile Spurs have served notice that they\u2019re determined to come again after last season\u2019s near misses. 90 min +2: Skipp comes on for Ndombele, who has made plenty of new friends tonight. McGinn drags a shot wide right, a sorry end to a rare second-half Villa attack. Sissoko bursts past a few static Villa players in the midfield. They are spent. He reaches the edge of the box and slides a pass to Kane on his left. Kane fizzes a shot past Heaton and into the bottom right. What a turnaround! 89 min: Moura drives down the right, Villa\u2019s ragged defence backpedalling in panic. He slashes a shot wide of goal. 88 min: Nkoudou comes on for Lamela, whose persistence looks to have won all three points for Spurs. He takes his own sweet time to depart, and is booked for his trouble. Grealish dawdles with the ball just outside his own area. He\u2019s robbed by Lamela, nipping in from behind. He tries to nick a clever pass between Mings and Engels. It pinballs off both hapless defenders and lands at the feet of Kane, who lashes home from the penalty spot! It had been coming. 85 min: Quite a few Villa players look exhausted. They\u2019re making no effort to chase loose balls, opting instead to keep their shape. 84 min: Eriksen is sent scampering down the middle by a cute Moura reverse pass. He slips the ball wide right for Sissoko, whose low shot is deflected out for yet another corner. Villa haven\u2019t had one yet. Anyway, they deal with this one easily enough. 82 min: Douglas Luiz, another Villa debutant, comes on for Hourihane. 80 min: Another Spurs corner on the right. The ball\u2019s worked to Alderweireld, who shoots from the edge of the box. The ball strikes the arm of Kodjia, who has just come on for Wesley. Too close for a penalty to be given, even after a pernickety VAR check. 79 min: Ndombele juggles the ball down the left and hooks into the mixer. Sanchez goes for a spectacular overhead with Moura better placed. Villa are hanging on now. 78 min: Eriksen whips the free kick between McGinn and Hourihane in the Villa wall, and towards the top left. Heaton adds another glorious save to his portfolio, tipping round the post at full stretch. 77 min: Rose tries to work a little space on the edge of the Villa D. He\u2019s clumsily clattered by Jota, and this is a free kick in extremely dangerous territory. Eriksen\u2019s eyes are shimmering right now. 75 min: Poor Heaton, who had made such a fine save. But what a goal by Ndombele ... who was about to be hooked! He\u2019s not getting subbed now. A sensational strike by Tottenham\u2019s new man! The corner\u2019s worked to Eriksen on the right wing. He crosses. Sanchez flashes the ball goalwards from six yards. Heaton saves spectacularly in the Pele-Banks style. But it\u2019s all for nothing, as the ball is recycled, and laid off to Ndombele, who curls an unstoppable shot into the bottom right from 25 yards! Unstoppable! 72 min: Wesley looks tired. He cheaply presents the ball to Sissoko, 30 yards from his own goal. Sissoko bursts down the right and earns Tottenham\u2019s tenth corner of the evening. From which ... 71 min: Eriksen sashays down the left and stands one up into the middle. Lamela can\u2019t get a head on the cross, and Heaton claims. This is a staunch defensive display by Villa, who have been stuck in their final third for most of this second half. 69 min: Kane again bustles towards the Villa back line, this time down the left. The ball\u2019s pulled back for Eriksen, who rushes in and snatches at his shot, which flies harmlessly wide left by some distance. 67 min: Spurs are turning up the pressure, though. A long ball down the middle. Kane is lurking, but Heaton races from his area to head clear. Problem is, the ball flies straight to Lamela, who looks to return it into the empty net from 40 yards. His shot is on target, but weak, and easily blocked by the covering Mings. 66 min: Kane bombs in from the left and shoots low. His effort is deflected wide left. Eriksen\u2019s corner isn\u2019t all that. Grealish romps off with the ball and is tugged back by Rose. No free kick, much to Grealish\u2019s annoyance. Lamela fizzes in a cross from the wing that\u2019s snaffled by Heaton. Probably just as well the keeper got that one. 64 min: Walker-Peters shoots from distance. Deflected. Corner. Before it can be taken, Eriksen comes on for Winks. Then Lamela\u2019s corner is flicked over the bar by Alderweireld, stealing in at the near post and heading just off target. As close as Spurs have come. 63 min: A bit scrappy, all of a sudden. Villa won\u2019t mind this at all, the scoreline being as it is. On the touchline, Christian Eriksen, warming up, is called back to the dugout. 61 min: McGinn and Walker-Peters tangle in the midfield. Walker-Peters sits on the ball. McGinn tries to toe-poke it clear. It inevitably ends in a shoving match, one that Walker-Peters is much more willing to entertain than McGinn, who can\u2019t be bothered. The ref comes across to calm everyone down. A quick check with VAR, because that\u2019s what happens these days, reveals nothing. We play on. 59 min: Jota, formerly of Birmingham City, comes on for his Villa debut. He replaces Trezeguet. 58 min: Ndombele has a whack from the best part of 30 yards. Nope. 57 min: Kane works some space out on the right, and sends a low cross into the mixer. Engels, with his back to goal, spins in midair to acrobatically hook clear. That\u2019s fine defending. 55 min: Kane comes again, barrelling down the inside-left channel and taking a shot that\u2019s deflected out for a corner. One corner leads to another, and the second\u2019s cleared by Engels. 53 min: Winks dinks into the Villa box from the right. Kane meets the ball with a weak header. Villa clear their lines easily. 52 min: McGinn nicks the ball off Winks and bursts into the Spurs box down the right. Sanchez comes over to cover. McGinn loses the run of his feet and stumbles to the ground. There are cries for a penalty - and VAR is checked - but McGinn makes no claim. He quite clearly tells Winks that he fell under his own steam. Which is honest of him, because he did get a clank in the back from Sanchez, who was busy falling over himself. Other players might have argued the toss, because you\u2019ve seen them given. 50 min: Oh my goodness, Spurs should be level. Lamela crosses from the left. It\u2019s deep. Ndombele might get a gentle flick on, he might not. Either way, his presence attracts all of Villa\u2019s defenders, and the ball drops to Sissoko, in acres just to the right of the six-yard box. He sends the ball fizzing across the face of goal. Neither a shot nor a cross. What a waste. 48 min: Sissoko earns a corner on the right. Lamela loops it in, and Mings bashes a header clear. Spurs have clearly had a talking-to at half-time. They\u2019re a little sharper into their challenges. 47 min: Villa definitely need to work on those kick-offs. Spurs get the second half underway. And for the second time today, Villa nearly concede straight from kick-off! Alderweireld launches a pass down the inside-left channel that releases Lamela into the box. He chests down but can\u2019t get a shot away. Nor can he find Kane in the middle. Sissoko tries to keep the move going, but Engels hoicks clear with Lamela trying to make good. Half-time entertainment. Spurs have had the lion\u2019s share of possession, but so blunt up front. Villa could easily have scored three or four. They\u2019ve been blistering on the counter. This is poised deliciously. It\u2019s been good fun, this. \u201cSpurs are flashy on the approach but can\u2019t convert,\u201d argues Mary Waltz. \u201cVilla have had multiple chances to double their lead and if Spurs don\u2019t tighten up their back line a massive upset is coming down the road.\u201d 45 min +1: Lamela sends Kane clear with a defence-splitter down the middle! Kane reaches the edge of the Villa box, draws Heaton and ... pulls his shot wide right. Another glorious opportunity given up by Tottenham\u2019s talisman. 45 min: Walker-Peters drives down the right yet again. He pulls the ball back for Ndombele, who chips delicately towards Kane, rising six yards from goal. It\u2019s a lovely ball, and Kane surely has to score. But he sends his header inches over the bar. That\u2019s a poor miss. 43 min: El Ghazi has a speculative effort from a good distance out on the left. It\u2019s on target, heading towards the bottom left, but Lloris would have been a miserable figure had he let that trickler in. France\u2019s World Cup winning captain claims. 41 min: Walker-Peters has been doing his bit out on the right. He wins yet another corner. But his team-mates aren\u2019t backing him up. Lamela\u2019s poor delivery is latched onto by Grealish, who sprays a ball wide left, setting Trezeguet off on the charge. Fortunately for Spurs, Winks was alive to the danger of the quick-break, and slides in to claim the ball. A quite brilliant challenge from Tottenham\u2019s best player in the Champions League final. 39 min: Winks has a shot from 25 yards. He drags the ball across the face of goal, left to right, and harmlessly out for a goal kick. In the dugout, Mauricio Pochettino is a picture of frustration, sitting back in his chair and grumbling quite a lot. 38 min: Sissoko tries to dribble his way past Taylor, just inside the Villa box with the away team pinned back. He\u2019s got options in the middle, but Taylor wins the duel. Another groan from the home fans. It\u2019s the travelling faithful making all the noise right now. 36 min: McGinn earns a free kick out on the right. With Spurs expecting direct action, the ball\u2019s sent out to Trezeguet on the other flank. The winger crosses and Wesley flashes a header towards the bottom left. But there\u2019s no power there. Lloris gathers. 34 min: Kane cuts in from the left and larrups a shot across Heaton and over the bar in the old-fashioned bustling style. It\u2019s as close as Spurs have come to an equaliser. 32 min: Another corner for Spurs, Walker-Peters dribbling down the right and winning it off Taylor. But from the set piece, Lamela gives up possession with risible ease, and suddenly Grealish is burning up the left wing at great pace. He cuts infield then plays a reverse pass down the inside left to release Trezeguet into the box. It should be a goal, but for the second time today the winger hesitates and wastes the opportunity. He eventually sends a weak effort into the arms of Lloris. 31 min: The perpetually busy Winks drops deep and pings a diagonal right-to-left ball towards Kane. Engels is forced to head behind for a corner. Nothing comes of the resulting set piece, and the crowd let out an anguished cry in frustration. 30 min: Hourihane hacks the free kick straight at Lamela, the first man, allowing Spurs to clear. Very poor. 29 min: Space for El Ghazi on the left. He fires it in low. Alderweireld is forced to hack clear under pressure from Wesley. El Ghazi comes again and goes over Sissoko\u2019s hanging leg. A cheap free kick purchased there, in a dangerous position, just to the side of the box. 27 min: Trezeguet belts down the right, the boss of Rose, and at high speed whips a deep cross that isn\u2019t a million miles away from El Ghazi, coming in from the other wing. Not quite. But Villa look really lively in attack now. And they\u2019re easy on the eye. 26 min: Ndombele strips Hourihane near the Villa box. Nice work, but then he seems caught between shooting and threading a pass through a gap for Kane. The ball dribbles through to Heaton. 24 min: Walker-Peters wins a corner down the right. The set piece is hit too long, but Rose is able to have another go from the other wing. That one\u2019s easily cleared. A slight amount of agitation is already surfacing in Tottenham\u2019s play. It\u2019s much too early to panic. 23 min: El Ghazi drives at Spurs down the left. He looks to have been brought down by Sissoko, but the referee weirdly gives the foul to Spurs. On the touchline, Dean Smith gesticulates in disgust, and his player\u2019s not too happy about the decision either. 21 min: McGinn, dropping deep, slides a sensational defence-splitting pass down the inside-right channel for Trezeguet. The winger strides into the box, drops a shoulder, and shapes to curl one into the bottom left. But he dawdles, allowing a combination of Sanchez and Alderweireld to block. That could easily have been 2-0. It probably should have been. It was a lovely pass by McGinn. 19 min: Trezeguet slips away from Ndombele with ease, and tears off down the right. He slips inside for Wesley, who should shuttle the ball on towards El Ghazi, clear on the left. But Spurs - and their new midfield man - are let off the hook when Wesley checks, turns the other way, and picks the wrong pass. Worrying gaps at the back for Spurs. 17 min: Walker-Peters whips a glorious cross in from the right. Lamela is this close to running in and meeting it with a strong nut. But he\u2019s inches away and it\u2019s Mings who heads instead, clearing for Villa. 16 min: A bit of treatment for the goalscorer McGinn, who nearly knacked himself while challenging Winks in an overly aggressive and clumsy manner. But it looks like he\u2019s good to continue. 14 min: Ndombele nearly dribbles clear down the left, but Hourihane does extremely well to stick to him like glue and usher him out of play. Villa are growing in confidence, understandably so. 13 min: Spurs try a route-one move of their own. Alderweireld strokes a long pass down the middle. Kane nips ahead of a spinning Mings, but can\u2019t take the ball under control and it zips through to Heaton. Nearly, though. 11 min: It would be fair to say that the goal came against the run of play. The Villa fans strike up a comic rendition of We\u2019re Gonna Win The League. ... Villa go straight up the other end and score the opener! Mings, out on the left, passes long down the middle. McGinn is immediately clear of Sanchez, who is woefully out of position. Rose tries to catch him, and slides across, but McGinn drops a shoulder to send him skidding away in the wrong direction. Then he slams clinically past Lloris into the bottom right! 8 min: Lamela decides to go straight for goal. He\u2019s looking to whip the ball across Heaton and into the top left, but succeeds only in hoicking it over the crossbar. Bad move, because ... 7 min: Taylor bowls Walker-Peters to the ground near the corner flag on the right. A panicked and utterly needless challenge. A free kick in a dangerous position. Spurs load the box. 6 min: Spurs continue to push Villa back. Lamela nearly tears clear on the left, but Engels is across to hack clear. It\u2019s a fast start from the hosts, a sluggish one from newly promoted Villa. 5 min: A huge chance for Spurs to open the scoring. Rose crosses from the left. Mings and Taylor are miles apart, and Moura is gifted a free header on the penalty spot. He really should score, but his downward effort is too close to Heaton and smothered. 3 min: Alderweireld, quarterbacking from deep, launches a long ball down the left for Rose, who plays it first time but only succeeds in looping into the arms of Heaton. 2 min: Villa still haven\u2019t had much of a touch. A bit shaken after that early scare. And we\u2019re off! And it\u2019s nearly a farcical return to the top tier for Villa. Elmohamady immediately gives up possession out on the Villa right. Moura scampers off with the ball, cuts in from the wing, and lashes over the bar while looking for the top right. That one would have been timed at 16 seconds. But before the game starts, there\u2019s time for a minute of warm applause in loving memory of Justin Edinburgh. The Leyton Orient manager passed away suddenly in June. He spent the majority of his playing career at Spurs, and everyone in the ground pays their respect. The teams are out! A magnificent atmosphere at Tottenham\u2019s gorgeous new stadium. Last year\u2019s Champions League finalists are in their famous lilywhite, while the Championship play-off winners sport their traditional claret and blue. We\u2019ll be off before you know it! Dean Smith speaks! \u201cThe performances in pre-season have been good. A lot has been made about the amount of players we\u2019ve brought in, but if you look at three of the back four today played the last 15 games of last season, and only conceded ten goals. The midfield three were the three that played at Wembley. El Ghazi was in the team already. We feel we deserve to be here, and are excited about the challenges ahead.\u201d Mauricio Pochettino meanwhile fends off questions about the absent Jan Vertonghen and the benched Christian Eriksen. An insouciant shrug in word form. He doesn\u2019t care for the subject at all. This is the first Saturday night match on Sky Sports under the new TV contract. They were always bound to come up with some wholly unnecessary innovation to celebrate the occasion, and what they\u2019ve unveiled is just asking for trouble. During the pre-match warm-up, pundit Jamie Redknapp wandered into the middle of the pitch, right among the players pinging passes this way and that. He\u2019s out there ostensibly to \u201ctake a closer look\u201d at Tanguy Ndombele, though why is not clear, because he then starts yammering on about clips he\u2019s already seen of the player. It\u2019s hard completely to concentrate on what he\u2019s saying, because you\u2019re waiting for a ball to hit him flush in his startled grid. It doesn\u2019t happen tonight, but give it time. If they keep this feature going, such slapstick is grimly inevitable. Tottenham\u2019s new midfielder Tanguy Ndombele does indeed make his debut this evening. However, the other big purchases, Giovani lo Celso and Ryan Sessegnon, don\u2019t feature at all. Christian Eriksen is only on the bench. Jan Vertonghen is out injured. Meanwhile it\u2019s all change for Aston Villa. They unveil keeper Tom Heaton, attackers Wesley and Trezeguet, and defender Bjorn Engels. Tyrone Mings and Anwar El Ghazi also make their first starts as full-time Villa players. Tottenham Hotspur: Lloris, Walker-Peters, Sanchez, Alderweireld, Rose, Sissoko, Winks, Ndombele, Lamela, Kane, Lucas Moura. Subs: Wanyama, Nkoudou, Dier, Gazzaniga, Eriksen, Aurier, Skipp. Aston Villa: Heaton, Elmohamady, Mings, Engels, Taylor, McGinn, Hourihane, Trezeguet, Grealish, El Ghazi, Wesley. Subs: Douglas Luiz, Lansbury, Steer, Konsa, Targett, Jota, Kodjia. Referee: Chris Kavanagh (Lancashire). Aston Villa are back! After three years in the wilderness, the seven-time champions of England and erstwhile conquerors of Europe are back! Tottenham Hotspur have missed them madly, as well ... on account of having won nine of their last ten games against them. History may only provide so much of a guide, though, because both teams have moved on since we last saw them. Spurs, unchanged for a couple of transfer windows, could finally shoogle things up this evening by giving their new signings Tanguy Ndombele and Giovani Lo Celso a debut at their fancy new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. They\u2019ll also be without the injured Dele Alli and the suspended Heung-min Son. And will they suffer a hangover from the bitter disappointment of Madrid? Ah, variables, old friend, it\u2019s been a while round these parts. Villa meanwhile have gone to town in the transfer market since reclaiming their top-flight status in the play-off final against Derby. Eleven new signings! Trezeguet and Wesley are the big hopes up front; Tyrone Mings and Matt Targett have been secured at the back. But perhaps most importantly, they\u2019ve managed to keep hold of Jack Grealish during the Championship years, and now have a midfielder beginning to realise his vast potential. Dean Smith has promised his side will go for it this season; consolidation is not their only goal. So both sets of fans have plenty to get excited about. Spurs - long established now as one of the best teams in Europe - are naturally big favourites against a newly promoted team that will need time to gel. But Villa have won their last three opening fixtures in the Premier League - at Arsenal, Stoke and Bournemouth - and will treat this match as a free shot. With so many new faces likely to be on show, it\u2019s sure to be fascinating. Here\u2019s to exciting and dramatic as well. It\u2019s on! Kick off: 5.30pm BST.",

The website Farmsubsidy.org, which lists EU rural subsidies, reveals that the Durham farm received almost \u20ac208,000 between 2000 and 2009, roughly \u20ac20,000 a year. The money was paid out to Cummings\u2019s parents and another family member for several reasons including \u201cset aside\u201d \u2013 the now abolished and controversial scheme that paid farmers not to grow anything. The programme has been blamed for making it harder for food producers in developing countries to compete with their European counterparts. A separate website, operated by the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, confirms further payments of roughly \u00a36,500 each were made to Cummings\u2019s parents \u201cfor practices beneficial for climate and environment\u201d in 2017 and 2018. And scrutiny of a third, offline database, reveals that subsidies worth nearly \u00a319,000 were paid out in 2014. The Liberal Democrats\u2019 spokeswoman for young people, Layla Moran, said: \u201cIt shows sheer hypocrisy from Cummings that his farm has raked in hundreds of thousands from the \u2018absurd subsidies\u2019 he so often criticises.\u201d It is not clear when Cummings became the co-owner of the farm which his father reportedly bought after retiring from the oil industry. Land Registry searches show he was a co-owner in 2013. Reports suggest he moved to the farm in 2002, after leaving his job as the Conservative party\u2019s director of strategy. A profile of the Oxford-educated Cummings, for the Conservative Home website, explains that after quitting the post, \u201che then proceeded to spend two and a half years in a bunker he and his father built for him on their farm in Durham, reading science and history and trying to understand the world\u201d. His return to frontline politics has divided Tories. Some question whether his desire for Brexit comes at the expense of appreciating what may happen in key industries if EU structures and financial support disappear overnight. Farmers have expressed their fears about what would happen to their sector. Last month, Helen Roberts of the National Sheep Association in Wales, said it would be \u201cabsolutely catastrophic\u201d to leave with no deal and could lead to civil unrest among sheep farmers. A Downing St spokeswoman declined to comment.",

She met people from the surrounding area whose villages are also due to be razed to make way for the mine.</p> <p>\u201cI have visited coal mines before, but this was so huge and so devastating to see,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes me incredibly sad, to see all this destruction, in this area that used to be a forest ecosystem, and I feel sorry for the people who have to move.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/08/archive-zip/giv-3902dQ6OaQouEjKA/\" data-alt=\"germany map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/08/archive-zip/giv-3902dQ6OaQouEjKA/\">germany map</a> </figure>  <p>The area, near Cologne in western Germany, is home to endangered species, including <a href=\"https://ptes.org/grants/uk-mammal-projects/bechsteins-bats/\" title=\"\">Bechstein\u2019s bats</a>, but its trees and fern-filled clearings also represent a rare remaining sliver of a woodland ecosystem that once filled this part of the Rhine river plain.</p> <p>Since mining began in 1978 the Hambach \u2013 or Hambi as activists affectionately call it \u2013 has shrunk to only 10% of the original 13,500 acres. The rest was cleared to allow the utility firm RWE to extract the \u201cbrown coal\u201d or lignite lying beneath, at a rate of about 40m tonnes a year.</p> <p>The trees are felled and the forest floor torn up to reach coal deposits, leaving long gashes of open earth, that mark out the mine on satellite photographs with streaks of black and ochre. The lignite, along with supplies taken from other mines in the area, is burned in nearby power stations. Three, the Niederau\u00dfem, Neurath and Weisweiler plants, are all individually among the 10 biggest carbon dioxide emitters in Europe. Together they make the region\u2019s coal the continent\u2019s biggest source of the greenhouse gas, the activists say.</p> <p>For more than seven years a committed group have been living in some of the oldest, tallest trees, serving as human shields against RWE.</p> <p>When Thunberg won Germany\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/greta-thunberg-wins-german-golden-camera-award/a-48131966\" title=\"\">Golden Camera award</a> in March, she dedicated it to the Hambach activists, who invited her to come and see their struggle for herself, and she started her trip to the Americas by taking up that offer.</p> <p>After visiting the mine she joined activists in one of the highest protest sites, lifted 15 metres off the ground in a climbing harness to a wooden house in the high branches of a centuries-old oak tree.</p> <p>Jana Boltersdorf, a 17-year-old protester who has been coming to the forest for years, said Thunberg\u2019s visit was a \u201csurreal\u201d inspiration.</p> <p>\u201cShe has become a great symbol for climate justice, and this forest also has become a great symbol for climate justice,\u201d Boltersdorf said. \u201cNow those two great symbols which are very important to my life are coming together. It doesn\u2019t feel real.\u201d</p> <p>Several times the treehouses have all been cleared and their occupants arrested, and several times the activists have returned to their perches. But in 2018, the regular showdown captured national attention, said Luisa Neubauer, one of the leaders of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2019/may/24/student-climate-strikes-around-the-world\" title=\"\">Fridays for Future</a> youth movement in Germany.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa27e18e65e6e93506a13c19dce024a8d55712a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa27e18e65e6e93506a13c19dce024a8d55712a2/0_123_1024_614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Dresen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Dresen holding a sign that says \u2018Let the villagers stay\u2019 in the partly cleared Hambach Forest.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emma Graham-Harrison/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And when it reached the national stage, the battle for Hambach brought the climate crisis into focus for many Germans, she believes, by connecting intangible carbon emissions to something both tangible and much loved.</p> <p>\u201cWild forest in Germany is a very important part of our culture, of our understanding of what this country is,\u201d Neubauer, said. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible [for many people] to imagine protecting the climate, but it is possible to imagine protecting the forest.\u201d</p> <p>Its destruction seems shortsighted as Germany pivots away from coal, which still provides about a third of the country\u2019s electricity. With a target to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 40% compared with 1990 levels, by next year, Berlin needs to act urgently.</p> <p>A government-appointed commission said last month that Germany should shut down all of its coal-fired power plants by 2038, and recommended setting aside \u20ac40bn (\u00a337bn) in aid to help areas affected by the shutdowns, where the mining and power industries are major employers.</p> <p>That new deadline has brought both frustration and hope for the forest protesters and people in villages around the area, whose homes had been slated for destruction.</p> <p>David Dresen, 28, has given up his job as a maths teacher to campaign for Kuckum, the village where his family have lived in the same farmhouse since the 1700s. Along with six others in the area it is due to be destroyed in 2027, but what once seemed like an almost hopeless fight now feels less bleak.</p> <p>\u201cWe have been fighting lignite since the 1980s and for a long time no one heard what we said,\u201d he said after meeting Thunberg. \u201cIf this movement is able to save the forest, why should it not be possible to save our villages?\u201d</p> <p>What remains of the forest has been given a stay of execution, but this is only temporary. With the confrontations between protesters and police gaining widespread publicity, and a case brought by environmentalists making its way through the courts, RWE has agreed a moratorium until 2020.</p> <p>Thunberg will be attending climate summits in New York in September and Santiago in December. She does not fly because of the carbon footprint this leaves, and so will travel overland to the UK, cross the Atlantic on a racing yacht, and finally travel by train and bus to Chile. \u201cI have not sailed before, so I\u2019m going now to get some basic lessons on what to do and what not to do,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the people I\u2019m going with are professionals so I\u2019m not worried about safety.\u201d</p>",

She met people from the surrounding area whose villages are also due to be razed to make way for the mine. \u201cI have visited coal mines before, but this was so huge and so devastating to see,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes me incredibly sad, to see all this destruction, in this area that used to be a forest ecosystem, and I feel sorry for the people who have to move.\u201d The area, near Cologne in western Germany, is home to endangered species, including Bechstein\u2019s bats, but its trees and fern-filled clearings also represent a rare remaining sliver of a woodland ecosystem that once filled this part of the Rhine river plain. Since mining began in 1978 the Hambach \u2013 or Hambi as activists affectionately call it \u2013 has shrunk to only 10% of the original 13,500 acres. The rest was cleared to allow the utility firm RWE to extract the \u201cbrown coal\u201d or lignite lying beneath, at a rate of about 40m tonnes a year. The trees are felled and the forest floor torn up to reach coal deposits, leaving long gashes of open earth, that mark out the mine on satellite photographs with streaks of black and ochre. The lignite, along with supplies taken from other mines in the area, is burned in nearby power stations. Three, the Niederau\u00dfem, Neurath and Weisweiler plants, are all individually among the 10 biggest carbon dioxide emitters in Europe. Together they make the region\u2019s coal the continent\u2019s biggest source of the greenhouse gas, the activists say. For more than seven years a committed group have been living in some of the oldest, tallest trees, serving as human shields against RWE. When Thunberg won Germany\u2019s Golden Camera award in March, she dedicated it to the Hambach activists, who invited her to come and see their struggle for herself, and she started her trip to the Americas by taking up that offer. After visiting the mine she joined activists in one of the highest protest sites, lifted 15 metres off the ground in a climbing harness to a wooden house in the high branches of a centuries-old oak tree. Jana Boltersdorf, a 17-year-old protester who has been coming to the forest for years, said Thunberg\u2019s visit was a \u201csurreal\u201d inspiration. \u201cShe has become a great symbol for climate justice, and this forest also has become a great symbol for climate justice,\u201d Boltersdorf said. \u201cNow those two great symbols which are very important to my life are coming together. It doesn\u2019t feel real.\u201d Several times the treehouses have all been cleared and their occupants arrested, and several times the activists have returned to their perches. But in 2018, the regular showdown captured national attention, said Luisa Neubauer, one of the leaders of the Fridays for Future youth movement in Germany. And when it reached the national stage, the battle for Hambach brought the climate crisis into focus for many Germans, she believes, by connecting intangible carbon emissions to something both tangible and much loved. \u201cWild forest in Germany is a very important part of our culture, of our understanding of what this country is,\u201d Neubauer, said. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible [for many people] to imagine protecting the climate, but it is possible to imagine protecting the forest.\u201d Its destruction seems shortsighted as Germany pivots away from coal, which still provides about a third of the country\u2019s electricity. With a target to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 40% compared with 1990 levels, by next year, Berlin needs to act urgently. A government-appointed commission said last month that Germany should shut down all of its coal-fired power plants by 2038, and recommended setting aside \u20ac40bn (\u00a337bn) in aid to help areas affected by the shutdowns, where the mining and power industries are major employers. That new deadline has brought both frustration and hope for the forest protesters and people in villages around the area, whose homes had been slated for destruction. David Dresen, 28, has given up his job as a maths teacher to campaign for Kuckum, the village where his family have lived in the same farmhouse since the 1700s. Along with six others in the area it is due to be destroyed in 2027, but what once seemed like an almost hopeless fight now feels less bleak. \u201cWe have been fighting lignite since the 1980s and for a long time no one heard what we said,\u201d he said after meeting Thunberg. \u201cIf this movement is able to save the forest, why should it not be possible to save our villages?\u201d What remains of the forest has been given a stay of execution, but this is only temporary. With the confrontations between protesters and police gaining widespread publicity, and a case brought by environmentalists making its way through the courts, RWE has agreed a moratorium until 2020. Thunberg will be attending climate summits in New York in September and Santiago in December. She does not fly because of the carbon footprint this leaves, and so will travel overland to the UK, cross the Atlantic on a racing yacht, and finally travel by train and bus to Chile. \u201cI have not sailed before, so I\u2019m going now to get some basic lessons on what to do and what not to do,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the people I\u2019m going with are professionals so I\u2019m not worried about safety.\u201d",

But now Epstein will not have to answer for his crimes, the full extent of which may never be known. Epstein cannot be questioned anymore. For his victims that is a tragedy. Jennifer Araoz, who accused Epstein of raping her when she was 15, probably spoke for many when she issued a statement laying bare her own burden: \u201cWe have to live with the scars of his actions for the rest of our lives, while he will never face the consequences of the crimes he committed, the pain and trauma he caused so many people. Epstein is gone, but justice must still be served.\u201d",

That makes communication vital and players today have a fantastic feel for the game: they have to be able to react and make decisions on the hoof. Rugby union was designed for all shapes and sizes but at the top level today it is all about being lean and fit: props no longer carry much fat. The sport moves on. A couple of years ago it was a power game, all about being big and physical and dominant in the set pieces, but now it is mobile. Other than at set pieces there are no numbers on backs.\u201d</p> <p>No European team made the last four of the 2015 World Cup but Wales and Ireland are in the top three of the world rankings while England are fifth, a fraction behind South Africa. The All Blacks have held first place since 2009 but their hold on the top position is looking its least secure in that time. If Wales are to make an impact in Japan, they will need to improve on their tournament record against the major southern hemisphere sides, which is currently one victory (against Australia in the 1987 third-place play-off) and 10 defeats.</p> <p>\u201cPreparations for a World Cup are at a different level every tournament and every side will be ready to rock,\u201d says Jenkins. \u201cThat is why the next month is important, starting with England. They have world-class players throughout their squad and strength in depth. They will be there or thereabouts in the World Cup. It is a big match for us.\u201d</p>",

Yet they are not ranked among the leading contenders by bookmakers for the World Cup, with New Zealand, England, South Africa and Ireland all having shorter odds. \u201cWe could have won another two Six Nations, made the 2011 World Cup final and got to the semi-finals four years ago,\u201d says Jenkins, Wales\u2019s record points scorer who is the only one of the management team who will be part of the setup under Gatland\u2019s successor, Wayne Pivac, next year. \u201cWe always demand more of ourselves.\u201d The role of a kicking coach, which was marginal when Jenkins started in the middle of the previous decade, is now central. \u201cThere is not much space at Test match level and you manipulate it by kicking,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I was a player, we would have dozens of back moves but the decline in the number of set pieces has reduced them to the point where it is mostly about variations on the move. \u201cYou have to understand defences and where the space is. That makes communication vital and players today have a fantastic feel for the game: they have to be able to react and make decisions on the hoof. Rugby union was designed for all shapes and sizes but at the top level today it is all about being lean and fit: props no longer carry much fat. The sport moves on. A couple of years ago it was a power game, all about being big and physical and dominant in the set pieces, but now it is mobile. Other than at set pieces there are no numbers on backs.\u201d No European team made the last four of the 2015 World Cup but Wales and Ireland are in the top three of the world rankings while England are fifth, a fraction behind South Africa. The All Blacks have held first place since 2009 but their hold on the top position is looking its least secure in that time. If Wales are to make an impact in Japan, they will need to improve on their tournament record against the major southern hemisphere sides, which is currently one victory (against Australia in the 1987 third-place play-off) and 10 defeats. \u201cPreparations for a World Cup are at a different level every tournament and every side will be ready to rock,\u201d says Jenkins. \u201cThat is why the next month is important, starting with England. They have world-class players throughout their squad and strength in depth. They will be there or thereabouts in the World Cup. It is a big match for us.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Benjamin Myers\u2019s eighth novel, <em>The Offing</em>, is the tale of Robert, a young man who, in the aftermath of the second world war, sets out across Yorkshire to Robin Hood\u2019s Bay, where he forges an unlikely friendship with an eccentric and artistic older woman, Dulcie. Myers\u2019s novels have always been challenging, intelligent and linguistically adventurous, and he built up a loyal underground following with books such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/08/beasting-benjamin-myer-review-austere-brilliantly-shocking\" title=\"\"><em>Beastings</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/15/pig-iron-benjamin-myers-review\" title=\"\"><em>Pig Iron</em></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/may/25/the-gallows-pole-benjamin-myers-review\" title=\"\"><em>The Gallows Pole</em></a>. This latter was his breakthrough success, winning the Walter Scott prize. He lives in Hebden Bridge with his wife, the novelist Adele Stripe.</p> <p><strong>Your previous novels were put out by a small independent publisher, </strong><strong>Bluemoose</strong><strong>. After the Walter Scott prize and the huge sales of <em>The Gallows Pole</em>, <em>The Offing</em> feels like a departure both in the fact that it\u2019s being published by Bloomsbury and in its more gentle, pastoral feel.</strong><br>I would describe it as quite a U-turn. It probably sounds a little bit disingenuous to say this, but I wrote the book for myself and for the preservation of my mental health. It was somewhere to escape to during dark winters in Yorkshire, but also I was reading a lot of pastoral fiction, a lot of Laurie Lee and HE Bates. For want of a better word, stuff that\u2019s quite \u201cnice\u201d. I thought the world was getting very angry, bitter and divided. I thought I\u2019d put out something that\u2019s positive, inject a bit of sunlight into the proceedings.</p> <p><strong>Like all your novels, it\u2019s deeply engaged with place, in this case Robin Hood\u2019s Bay. What was it about that landscape that made you want to write about it?</strong><br>This is something I\u2019ve only figured out in the last few weeks as the book has gone to print. When I was 12 years old, I was really ill. I injured myself skateboarding and was taken to hospital and I was pissing blood and was in a really bad way. I ended up having my kidney removed. I was in and out of hospital for months. My parents wanted to take me away for some recuperation, but we couldn\u2019t go far, so we went from Durham to North Yorkshire, to Robin Hood\u2019s Bay. So subconsciously it\u2019s a place I went to when I was ill and just found it a slightly otherworldly place with these smuggling connections and the history. I\u2019ve been going for a few years with my wife to stay there and every time it\u2019s been an escape from my writing and the grey, windswept landscape of West Yorkshire, where I live.</p> <p><strong>You started your career as a music journalist for <em>Melody Maker</em>. Your first novel was about </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/26/richey-edwards-manic-street-preachers\" title=\"\"><strong>Richey Edwards</strong></a><strong> of the Manic Street Preachers. How much did this influence your subsequent work?</strong><br>It was always only a means to an end to writing fiction. But I\u2019ve always had that hardcore punk mentality where you do things for yourself and you don\u2019t wait for anyone to accept it or approve things. The difference is that I\u2019m a hardcore punk who\u2019s now writing about poetry, wild meadows and beekeeping.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019d never written historical fiction before. Did the success of <em>The Gallows Pole</em> come as a surprise to you?</strong><br><em>The Gallows Pole</em> was a story that was literally on my doorstep and whose paths I\u2019ve been walking every day, so it didn\u2019t feel like a massive leap for me. There are relatives of the Crag Vale Coiners [the 18th century gang of counterfeiters featured in the book] who live on my street. I didn\u2019t consider it a historical novel until it was up for the Walter Scott prize. It gave me confidence that I was able to write what I want to write. So now I\u2019m working on a quartet of novels set across 1,300 years. It\u2019s ambitious, but each one is quite separate and quite small, so I\u2019m trying not to get overwhelmed by the concept. There\u2019s no career plan, but I\u2019m obsessed with writing. It\u2019s the only time I don\u2019t feel anxious, the only time I feel in control of the world.</p> <p><strong>What books are on your bedside table?</strong><br>Absolutely loads. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/27/sweet-home-by-wendy-erskine-review\" title=\"\"><em>Sweet Home</em></a> by Wendy Erskine. A book by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/07/icebreaker-a-voyage-far-north-horatio-clare-review\" title=\"\">Horatio Clare about travelling on an icebreaker</a> through the Finnish seas. There\u2019s a collection by the poet Zaffar Kunial [<em>Six</em>] about cricket. It\u2019s a sport I\u2019m not remotely interested in. I think it\u2019s a good sign that you can read something about a subject you\u2019re not remotely interested in and still find it gripping. Then there\u2019s a pile of DH Lawrence I\u2019m slowly working through.</p> <p><strong>What do you read for sheer pleasure?</strong><br>I\u2019ve read a lot of books by bare-knuckle boxing gypsies. Memoirs of bad men. True crime books. I like reading old rural books \u2013 accounts of poachers from the 1920s. I don\u2019t consider anything a guilty pleasure.</p> <p><strong>What book would you give to a child?</strong><br>Either <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/my-side-of-the-mountain-9780142401118.html\" title=\"\"><em>My Side of the Mountain</em></a> by Jean Craighead George or <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/danny-the-champion-of-the-world-9780141361574.html\" title=\"\"><em>Danny the Champion of the World</em></a>, which had a massive impact on me as a child.</p> <p><strong>How do you organise your books?</strong><br>Vaguely alphabetically, but not strict and definitely not by colour. That\u2019s the behaviour of a psychopath.</p> <p><strong>What classic novel have you recently read for the first time?</strong><br><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/inheritors-357789.html\" title=\"\"><em>The Inheritors</em></a> by William Golding. That\u2019s been by my bed for years and I knew I would love it and I did.</p> <p><strong>What kind of reader were you as a child?</strong><br>I was obsessed with Judy Blume books, to the extent that every week I\u2019d write a book report for my teacher in junior school about the latest Judy Blume I\u2019d read, even though I didn\u2019t have to. I read all of them and knew everything there was to know about training bras and periods by the time I was 10. I read a lot of American writers like Betsy Byars and Paula Danziger. Then I started reading horror. I got a taste for the macabre very early on. When I was about 10 or 11 I read a really graphic book about Denis Nilsen [the serial killer] and I think that had a massive effect on me.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>The Offing</em> is published by Bloomsbury (\u00a316.99).

The Gallows Pole was a story that was literally on my doorstep and whose paths I\u2019ve been walking every day, so it didn\u2019t feel like a massive leap for me. There are relatives of the Crag Vale Coiners [the 18th century gang of counterfeiters featured in the book] who live on my street. I didn\u2019t consider it a historical novel until it was up for the Walter Scott prize. It gave me confidence that I was able to write what I want to write. So now I\u2019m working on a quartet of novels set across 1,300 years. It\u2019s ambitious, but each one is quite separate and quite small, so I\u2019m trying not to get overwhelmed by the concept. There\u2019s no career plan, but I\u2019m obsessed with writing. It\u2019s the only time I don\u2019t feel anxious, the only time I feel in control of the world. What books are on your bedside table? Absolutely loads. Sweet Home by Wendy Erskine. A book by Horatio Clare about travelling on an icebreaker through the Finnish seas. There\u2019s a collection by the poet Zaffar Kunial [Six] about cricket. It\u2019s a sport I\u2019m not remotely interested in. I think it\u2019s a good sign that you can read something about a subject you\u2019re not remotely interested in and still find it gripping. Then there\u2019s a pile of DH Lawrence I\u2019m slowly working through. What do you read for sheer pleasure? I\u2019ve read a lot of books by bare-knuckle boxing gypsies. Memoirs of bad men. True crime books. I like reading old rural books \u2013 accounts of poachers from the 1920s. I don\u2019t consider anything a guilty pleasure. What book would you give to a child? Either My Side of the Mountain by Jean Craighead George or Danny the Champion of the World, which had a massive impact on me as a child. How do you organise your books? Vaguely alphabetically, but not strict and definitely not by colour. That\u2019s the behaviour of a psychopath. What classic novel have you recently read for the first time? The Inheritors by William Golding. That\u2019s been by my bed for years and I knew I would love it and I did. What kind of reader were you as a child? I was obsessed with Judy Blume books, to the extent that every week I\u2019d write a book report for my teacher in junior school about the latest Judy Blume I\u2019d read, even though I didn\u2019t have to. I read all of them and knew everything there was to know about training bras and periods by the time I was 10. I read a lot of American writers like Betsy Byars and Paula Danziger. Then I started reading horror. I got a taste for the macabre very early on. When I was about 10 or 11 I read a really graphic book about Denis Nilsen [the serial killer] and I think that had a massive effect on me. \u2022 The Offing is published by Bloomsbury (\u00a316.99).

      "body": "<p>It is nearly 45 years since the Rumble in the Jungle \u2013 and still the myth of that wild night lingers, dangerously ignored.</p> <p>There is much to learn from deconstructing the most famous sporting event of the 20th century. When a fierce storm swept through Kinshasa shortly after Muhammad Ali had landed his perfect finisher on George Foreman in the eighth round, coming off the ropes to level the most feared champion since Sonny Liston, it was not enough to cleanse Zaire of the stench of collusion and bad dealings.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/09/anthony-joshua-rematch-andy-ruiz-jr-saudi-arabia-7-december\">Amnesty International criticises sanctioning of Joshua v Ruiz Jr in Saudi Arabia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A morally anaesthetised audience of 60,000 people had earlier gathered that 30 October 1974, in the Stade Tata Rapha\u00ebl \u2013 once a place where dissidents were executed \u2013 as well as millions watching and listening elsewhere, all witnesses to the Great Deception.</p> <p>Chief among the myths the world was asked to believe was that this was a dignified return by Ali and Foreman to their African roots, when the ogre was slain by the voodoo skills of a 32-year\u2011old opponent cloaked in magic. It was sold as a celebration, a wholesome metaphor for change in the wake of the moral vacuum created by the Vietnam war. It was only superficially so. And even the clich\u00e9s stank.</p> <p>There were African bands and their descendant heirs from America, jazzing it up for a film that would gather dust until 1996; smart writers from magazines expressed their views on the art and blood of fisticuffs. Hunter S Thompson got stoned back at the hotel and missed it all. It was of its time, an exercise in freewheeling cynicism. As the late Hugh McIlvanney wrote in these pages, it was a night when \u201cethnic pride and financial avarice became ardent bedmates\u201d.</p> <p>It was undeniably a great fight \u2013 probably the Greatest\u2019s greatest. And there was no shortage of mystical brilliance. As Ali told McIlvanney: \u201cI even cancelled the rain.

      "bodyText": "It is nearly 45 years since the Rumble in the Jungle \u2013 and still the myth of that wild night lingers, dangerously ignored. There is much to learn from deconstructing the most famous sporting event of the 20th century. When a fierce storm swept through Kinshasa shortly after Muhammad Ali had landed his perfect finisher on George Foreman in the eighth round, coming off the ropes to level the most feared champion since Sonny Liston, it was not enough to cleanse Zaire of the stench of collusion and bad dealings. A morally anaesthetised audience of 60,000 people had earlier gathered that 30 October 1974, in the Stade Tata Rapha\u00ebl \u2013 once a place where dissidents were executed \u2013 as well as millions watching and listening elsewhere, all witnesses to the Great Deception. Chief among the myths the world was asked to believe was that this was a dignified return by Ali and Foreman to their African roots, when the ogre was slain by the voodoo skills of a 32-year\u2011old opponent cloaked in magic. It was sold as a celebration, a wholesome metaphor for change in the wake of the moral vacuum created by the Vietnam war. It was only superficially so. And even the clich\u00e9s stank. There were African bands and their descendant heirs from America, jazzing it up for a film that would gather dust until 1996; smart writers from magazines expressed their views on the art and blood of fisticuffs. Hunter S Thompson got stoned back at the hotel and missed it all. It was of its time, an exercise in freewheeling cynicism. As the late Hugh McIlvanney wrote in these pages, it was a night when \u201cethnic pride and financial avarice became ardent bedmates\u201d. It was undeniably a great fight \u2013 probably the Greatest\u2019s greatest. And there was no shortage of mystical brilliance. As Ali told McIlvanney: \u201cI even cancelled the rain. It stayed dry for the fight, then an hour after it there was a storm that nearly flooded the place.\u201d But it was overridingly a business deal hiding under the halo of good intentions and mired in the muck of dictatorship. Don King told each fighter the other had agreed to a purse of $5m. And they had. How could they say no? There are ways ... When and if Anthony Joshua and Andy Ruiz Jr sign contracts for a heavyweight rematch that looks almost certain to take them to Saudi Arabia on 7 December, maybe they should recall the much bigger occasion that was the perfect template for looking the other way. For Mobutu Sese Seke, the despot who ruled Zaire, read Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, still in the dock of global condemnation for the assassination of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, as well as the daily atrocities being committed in Yemen. The Saudi regime have for at least two years used sport to draw a curtain of legitimacy over their doings. They even tried unsuccessfully to co-opt the spotless tennis stars Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. As Amnesty International UK\u2019s head of campaigns, Felix Jakens, said on Friday: \u201cIf Anthony Joshua fights Andy Ruiz Jr in Saudi Arabia, it\u2019s likely to be yet another opportunity for the Saudi authorities to try to \u2018sportswash\u2019 their severely tarnished image.\u201d If Joshua, a decent man, doubts that judgment, he should look to the Rumble in the Jungle. There is still time for him and Ruiz to change their minds, but not a lot of it. The rope-a-dope strategy attributed to Ali\u2019s unlikely victory spoke to a more significant trick, that dealt to the world by King and by Mobutu, who bankrolled the circus with his poor country\u2019s money. They convinced everyone that a mere boxing match mattered more than the subjugation of a nation and its people. And the blame needs spreading. John Daly, the Londoner who found the money for King and Mobutu through Barclays bank in Switzerland, offered Ali $10m to fight Joe Frazier for a third time, in Beirut.

      "bodyText": "Listeners to BBC\u2019s Desert Island Discs have split into factions this weekend as fans of its latest presenter, Lauren Laverne, left, have mounted a high-profile defence of her in the face of calls for Radio 4 bosses to re-think her appointment as Kirsty Young\u2019s successor. The outpouring of love on social media has come from famous names such as Matt Lucas, Irvine Welsh, Robert Webb and Caitlin Moran, and prompted Laverne, 41, to post a warm message of thanks on Twitter on Friday night. \u201cToday has been an entirely unexpected inventory of who is in my corner.

      "body": "<p>Jamie Demetriou, 31, was born in Friern Barnet, north London, and joined the Chickenshed theatre group aged five. He studied at Bristol University and took an acclaimed student revue show to the Edinburgh fringe. His acting credits include <em>Fleabag</em>, <em>This Time </em><em>With Alan Partridge</em>, <em>Sally4Ever</em> and <em>Paddington 2</em>. He is currently appearing in <em>Horrible Histories: The Movie</em> and Hulu\u2019s TV version of <em>Four Weddings and a Funeral</em>. The second series of his Bafta-nominated sitcom <em>Stath Lets Flats</em>, about an incompetent Greek-Cypriot estate agent, airs on Channel 4 next week.</p> <p><strong>Why did you set your sitcom in a lettings agency?</strong><br>God knows! I ask myself this question every day. I had no stake in that world. They say \u201cwrite what you know\u201d but I wrote about the thing I know least about. I needed to find a home for this character, an asexual idiot with a Greek-London accent. One early version was called \u201cFlats &amp; Chips\u201d, about a lettings agency and a chip shop side-by-side and the rivalry between them. That would have had legs for about, ooh, half an episode.</p> <p><strong>How do you feel about lettings agents: loathe them or secretly fond?</strong><br>Not secretly fond, openly fond, just because I\u2019ve spent so much time thinking about them. When my friends go for flat viewings, I\u2019ll tag along as research. I\u2019m always curious how the agent will react, but they\u2019re usually quite into it. It doesn\u2019t stop them acting like fucking dickheads, though. I went on one with a mate and the flat was freezing. My mate was like: \u201cIt\u2019s pretty cold in here. Isn\u2019t it insulated? The windows feel thin and draughty.\u201d The estate agent went: \u201cIt feels cold, like the windows are thin, yeah? But trust me, it\u2019s not and they\u2019re not.\u201d Oh, that\u2019s OK then. Nobody ever says \u201ctrust me\u201d if they have done their research, right?</p> <p><strong>Have you had terrible flat viewings yourself?</strong><br>We all have, haven\u2019t we? One guy who showed us a flat in Brixton was really sweating and panicking. Eventually he blurted out: \u201cLook, are you going to take it?\u201d When we said no, he just turned and legged it out of the flat. Then we watched him through the window, furiously thumping the bonnet of his car. He\u2019d spotted that he\u2019d been given a parking ticket but was so desperate for the sale, he obviously thought \u201cIf I get this commission, that fine will pay for itself\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Your sister Natasia plays Stath\u2019s sister Sophie in the show. How does th</strong><strong>at compare </strong><strong>with your</strong><strong> real relationship</strong><strong>?</strong><br>Sophie and Stath are us in a parallel universe. If we hadn\u2019t been given the confidence to get up and perform, we\u2019d have ended up crying on a sofa together, watching TV and eating crisps. Tash is very confident, outspoken and hilarious, but Sophie shows her sweet, vulnerable side that few people get to see. She\u2019s exquisite in it and counter-balances Stath\u2019s multi-coloured buffoonery.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e93279d690b10658f9a409e721cd778f7b5df498\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e93279d690b10658f9a409e721cd778f7b5df498/0_2_1489_893/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Waller Bridge and Jamie Demetriou smiling at a woman with her back to us, with Demetriou showing two large incisors.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demetriou, alongside Phoebe Waller-Bridge, as \u2018Bus Rodent\u2019 in Fleabag.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hal Shinnie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>The unrequited romance between Sophie and Stath\u2019s colleague Al is lovely. Was it influenced by Tim and Dawn from <em>The Office</em>?</strong><br>For my generation, it\u2019s impossible to not be influenced by <em>The Office</em>. It was inspirational to see someone write and star in a comedy that felt true to his sensibilities. That\u2019s what I always wanted to do. If you put an unrequited hetero romance in any comedy nowadays, it\u2019s difficult to avoid comparisons to Tim and Dawn because theirs is the greatest love story in British comedy.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the feedback been from London\u2019s Greek-Cypriot community?</strong><br>Mixed. The younger generation are way more into it. My dad tells me about rows he has at his cafe, where older people complain about it making Greek people look silly. Would they really rather I played a dull Greek straight man in the background? I see it as a celebration of the culture. Everyone\u2019s stupid in the show, it just so happens that I\u2019m Greek and I\u2019m mocking myself.</p> <p><strong>And the letting agent community?</strong><br>Not happy either. I read a few forums and one said: \u201cOh typical, a sitcom about crap letting agents, not the classic diligent, hard-working letting agent we all know and love.\u201d Er, what show is that and how can I not watch it? \u201cRent a flat again, did you?\u201d \u201cYeah I did, smashed it.\u201d Roll credits.</p> <p><strong>Tell us about the new series\u2026</strong><br>Stath\u2019s dad has appointed a manager who isn\u2019t Stath, so he\u2019s struggling to come to terms with that lack of nepotism. The new boss brings an understanding of where the London property market is headed, so Stath has to get his tiny brain around gentrification and meeting millennials. He struggles with the fact that exposed brick is good and plastic garden chairs are bad. We also see more of his desperate desire to be a family man. I\u2019ve always been fascinated by those deeply broody wideboys. They have the whole naughty boy lifestyle but, my God, their son\u2019s going to be an angel.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce8d4e7a3dc2f2eefadfc663337814e3877d45e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce8d4e7a3dc2f2eefadfc663337814e3877d45e3/0_264_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jamie Demetriou with the cast of Stath Lets Flats.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jamie Demetriou with the cast of Stath Lets Flats.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jack Barnes</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Are you broody yourself?</strong><br>I am, actually. It\u2019s in my blood. Virtually my first words were \u201cCan I have a baby?\u201d I\u2019ve wanted a kid since I was a kid. I grew up in London, so my nurture was very western, but my dad\u2019s Cypriot and there are three areas where my Mediterranean heritage comes to the fore: my broodiness, my taste palate and my love of deep Euro r\u2019n\u2019b cuts. The latter is why I\u2019ve considered asking Peter Andre to appear on the show. I\u2019ve resisted so far but it\u2019s a matter of time.</p> <p><strong>Do you enjoy wearing Stath\u2019s costume of cheap suit, pointy shoes and diamond ear stud?</strong><br>I love the crap shoes and mundane suits but the magnetic earring takes its toll. I was hoping to get my ear pierced to make it easier but the Baftas were the day before we started shooting and I just got it into my head: \u201cWhat if I have a reaction and have a freakishly swollen ear at the Baftas?\u201d It might be the only time I get to go and don\u2019t want my memory to be of a deformed ear. So I went back to the magnetic one, which crunches the flesh. My left earlobe is now longer than my right.</p> <p><strong>You played \u201cBus Rodent\u201d in the first series of <em>Fleabag</em>. Do people still come up and ask about your goofy teeth?</strong><br>Weirdly, there\u2019s been a resurgence since series two came out \u2013 people demanding I open my mouth to see if they\u2019re real. Phoebe Waller-Bridge has an insane grasp of the human condition. She had to stick to her guns to get it made, but wasn\u2019t precious about it. She was collaborative; open to people mucking around rather than being tied to the script. There\u2019s a scene where I say: \u201cYou don\u2019t go through life with teeth like these and not know when someone\u2019s pretending.\u201d She came up with that just before the take, yet it\u2019s the line that gets quoted at me most.</p> <p><strong>Is it a golden era for TV comedy</strong><strong>? What else are you enjoying?</strong><br>It\u2019s sneakily become one, yeah. <em>This Country</em> deserves every bit of praise it gets. Me and Tash met the Coopers [siblings Daisy May and Charlie] and quite happily agreed they\u2019re the funniest brother and sister in the country. <em>Pls Like</em> is a complete joy, everything Julia Davis touches is amazing, and the latest Alan Partridge series was phenomenal. I was lucky enough to have a cameo in it [as a laddish chef] and being on set was extraordinary. I felt like a teenager again, relearning how to do comedy. </p> <p><strong>Your dad\u2019s a chef. Didn\u2019t George Michael work in one of his restaurants?</strong><br>Yes, as a dishwasher. We saw George Michael on TV a few years ago and my dad went: \u201cUgh!\u201d I said: \u201cNot a fan?\u201d He was like: \u201cNo, he was always bloody singing when he should have been washing dishes.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Are there any real-life characters you\u2019d like to play?</strong><br>Darius from <em>Popstars</em> in a billion-dollar Hollywood biopic. This is purely out of fondness. I genuinely rewatch that series on a monthly basis. I know every word.</p> <p><em>Stath Lets Flats returns to Channel 4 at 10pm on 19 August</em></p>",

The new boss brings an understanding of where the London property market is headed, so Stath has to get his tiny brain around gentrification and meeting millennials. He struggles with the fact that exposed brick is good and plastic garden chairs are bad. We also see more of his desperate desire to be a family man. I\u2019ve always been fascinated by those deeply broody wideboys. They have the whole naughty boy lifestyle but, my God, their son\u2019s going to be an angel. Are you broody yourself? I am, actually. It\u2019s in my blood. Virtually my first words were \u201cCan I have a baby?\u201d I\u2019ve wanted a kid since I was a kid. I grew up in London, so my nurture was very western, but my dad\u2019s Cypriot and there are three areas where my Mediterranean heritage comes to the fore: my broodiness, my taste palate and my love of deep Euro r\u2019n\u2019b cuts. The latter is why I\u2019ve considered asking Peter Andre to appear on the show. I\u2019ve resisted so far but it\u2019s a matter of time. Do you enjoy wearing Stath\u2019s costume of cheap suit, pointy shoes and diamond ear stud? I love the crap shoes and mundane suits but the magnetic earring takes its toll. I was hoping to get my ear pierced to make it easier but the Baftas were the day before we started shooting and I just got it into my head: \u201cWhat if I have a reaction and have a freakishly swollen ear at the Baftas?\u201d It might be the only time I get to go and don\u2019t want my memory to be of a deformed ear. So I went back to the magnetic one, which crunches the flesh. My left earlobe is now longer than my right. You played \u201cBus Rodent\u201d in the first series of Fleabag. Do people still come up and ask about your goofy teeth? Weirdly, there\u2019s been a resurgence since series two came out \u2013 people demanding I open my mouth to see if they\u2019re real. Phoebe Waller-Bridge has an insane grasp of the human condition. She had to stick to her guns to get it made, but wasn\u2019t precious about it. She was collaborative; open to people mucking around rather than being tied to the script. There\u2019s a scene where I say: \u201cYou don\u2019t go through life with teeth like these and not know when someone\u2019s pretending.\u201d She came up with that just before the take, yet it\u2019s the line that gets quoted at me most. Is it a golden era for TV comedy? What else are you enjoying? It\u2019s sneakily become one, yeah. This Country deserves every bit of praise it gets. Me and Tash met the Coopers [siblings Daisy May and Charlie] and quite happily agreed they\u2019re the funniest brother and sister in the country. Pls Like is a complete joy, everything Julia Davis touches is amazing, and the latest Alan Partridge series was phenomenal. I was lucky enough to have a cameo in it [as a laddish chef] and being on set was extraordinary. I felt like a teenager again, relearning how to do comedy. Your dad\u2019s a chef. Didn\u2019t George Michael work in one of his restaurants? Yes, as a dishwasher. We saw George Michael on TV a few years ago and my dad went: \u201cUgh!\u201d I said: \u201cNot a fan?\u201d He was like: \u201cNo, he was always bloody singing when he should have been washing dishes.\u201d Are there any real-life characters you\u2019d like to play? Darius from Popstars in a billion-dollar Hollywood biopic. This is purely out of fondness. I genuinely rewatch that series on a monthly basis. I know every word.

      "body": "<p>It was the anthem everyone loved to hate, a musical concoction derided as an affront to patriotism and taste.</p> <p>The lyrics of Ireland\u2019s Call urged the Irish to stand tall \u201cshoulder to shoulder\u201d before every rugby match, but many preferred to stay seated and mock the injunction.</p> <p>The Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) commissioned the song in 1995 as an alternative to the republic\u2019s anthem, Amhr\u00e1n na bhFiann (The Soldier\u2019s Song), to accommodate players and supporters from Northern Ireland who tended to come from a unionist background.</p> <p>Phil Coulter, the Derry-born writer of Puppet on a String and other UK chart-toppers, responded with Ireland\u2019s Call. Critics were harsh. \u201cPassive-aggressive audio waterboarding,\u201d said the <em>Irish Times</em>.</p> <p>But the tide has turned. Athletes and sports fans are showing increasing affection for the song, which is now sung with gusto in stadiums. And growing speculation about a united Ireland \u2013 and how it should accommodate unionists \u2013 imbues Ireland\u2019s Call with prescience.</p> <p>Last week the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said a united Ireland would necessitate a \u201cdifferent state\u201d to make unionists feel welcome. And the <em>Irish Time</em>s <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/would-a-united-ireland-see-everyone-together-standing-tall-1.3979890\" title=\"\">U-turned on the song</a>, calling it \u201ca noble example of the compromises a united Ireland would involve\u201d.</p> <p>Coulter is claiming vindication. \u201cThe rugby fraternity did not fall in love with the song. It was a long process with a serious amount of begrudgery,\u201d he told the <em>Observer</em>. \u201cAs a race, we don\u2019t like being told what to do or what to sing. It was a slow burn.\u201d</p> <p>Crowds at Dublin\u2019s Aviva Stadium \u2013 which on Saturday hosted a World Cup warm-up game against Italy \u2013 now heed Ireland\u2019s Call, he said. \u201cThe proof of the pudding is when the band starts up and people sing their heads off. People vote with their larynx.\u201d</p> <p>Players have also become more enthusiastic. Brian O\u2019Driscoll, a former captain, told a documentary he used to stay shtum during Ireland\u2019s Call, which at home games is played after the national anthem. \u201cI was like \u2018pffft, Amhr\u00e1n na bhFiann is really my anthem.\u201d His mother convinced him of a responsibility to sing both. \u201cShe was right \u2026 it was my duty to try and be part of something that incorporates everyone.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c506a851d9c8fe12da9bd15b102189b98ed233b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c506a851d9c8fe12da9bd15b102189b98ed233b6/0_95_5372_3223/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Songwriter Phil Coulter, the composer of Ireland\u2019s Call, in 1987.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Songwriter Phil Coulter, the composer of Ireland\u2019s Call, in 1987.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Independent News and Media/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cricket and hockey, which like rugby operate on an all-Ireland basis, have also adopted Coulter\u2019s song.</p> <p>With Brexit and demographic shifts in Northern Ireland putting a united Ireland \u2013 and the need to woo unionists \u2013 on the political agenda, even Sinn F\u00e9in has signalled openness to changing the flag and anthem.</p> <p>Unionists have long recoiled at Amhr\u00e1n na bhFiann, an expression of Irish nationalism sung by republican rebels during the 1916 Rising. Rugby players from Northern Ireland tended to not sing it \u2013 a reluctance deepened in 1987 when an IRA bomb aimed at a judge injured three players travelling from Belfast to Dublin.</p> <p>An improvised alternative at that year\u2019s World Cup \u2013 a scratchy recording of The Rose of Tralee \u2013 was deemed a disaster. So the IRFU commissioned Coulter, who has also written hits for Cliff Richard and the Bay City Rollers, to come up with something rousing and inclusive.</p> <p>He avoided the word \u201cunited\u201d and instead invoked four proud provinces \u201ctogether standing tall, shoulder to shoulder\u201d.

      "bodyText": "It was the anthem everyone loved to hate, a musical concoction derided as an affront to patriotism and taste. The lyrics of Ireland\u2019s Call urged the Irish to stand tall \u201cshoulder to shoulder\u201d before every rugby match, but many preferred to stay seated and mock the injunction. The Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) commissioned the song in 1995 as an alternative to the republic\u2019s anthem, Amhr\u00e1n na bhFiann (The Soldier\u2019s Song), to accommodate players and supporters from Northern Ireland who tended to come from a unionist background. Phil Coulter, the Derry-born writer of Puppet on a String and other UK chart-toppers, responded with Ireland\u2019s Call. Critics were harsh. \u201cPassive-aggressive audio waterboarding,\u201d said the Irish Times. But the tide has turned. Athletes and sports fans are showing increasing affection for the song, which is now sung with gusto in stadiums. And growing speculation about a united Ireland \u2013 and how it should accommodate unionists \u2013 imbues Ireland\u2019s Call with prescience. Last week the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said a united Ireland would necessitate a \u201cdifferent state\u201d to make unionists feel welcome. And the Irish Times U-turned on the song, calling it \u201ca noble example of the compromises a united Ireland would involve\u201d. Coulter is claiming vindication. \u201cThe rugby fraternity did not fall in love with the song. It was a long process with a serious amount of begrudgery,\u201d he told the Observer. \u201cAs a race, we don\u2019t like being told what to do or what to sing. It was a slow burn.\u201d Crowds at Dublin\u2019s Aviva Stadium \u2013 which on Saturday hosted a World Cup warm-up game against Italy \u2013 now heed Ireland\u2019s Call, he said. \u201cThe proof of the pudding is when the band starts up and people sing their heads off. People vote with their larynx.\u201d Players have also become more enthusiastic. Brian O\u2019Driscoll, a former captain, told a documentary he used to stay shtum during Ireland\u2019s Call, which at home games is played after the national anthem. \u201cI was like \u2018pffft, Amhr\u00e1n na bhFiann is really my anthem.\u201d His mother convinced him of a responsibility to sing both. \u201cShe was right \u2026 it was my duty to try and be part of something that incorporates everyone.\u201d Cricket and hockey, which like rugby operate on an all-Ireland basis, have also adopted Coulter\u2019s song. With Brexit and demographic shifts in Northern Ireland putting a united Ireland \u2013 and the need to woo unionists \u2013 on the political agenda, even Sinn F\u00e9in has signalled openness to changing the flag and anthem. Unionists have long recoiled at Amhr\u00e1n na bhFiann, an expression of Irish nationalism sung by republican rebels during the 1916 Rising. Rugby players from Northern Ireland tended to not sing it \u2013 a reluctance deepened in 1987 when an IRA bomb aimed at a judge injured three players travelling from Belfast to Dublin. An improvised alternative at that year\u2019s World Cup \u2013 a scratchy recording of The Rose of Tralee \u2013 was deemed a disaster. So the IRFU commissioned Coulter, who has also written hits for Cliff Richard and the Bay City Rollers, to come up with something rousing and inclusive. He avoided the word \u201cunited\u201d and instead invoked four proud provinces \u201ctogether standing tall, shoulder to shoulder\u201d. He anticipated resistance, especially from southerners who feared a northern plot. \u201cIt didn\u2019t surprise me. I didn\u2019t take to my bed or sulk in a corner. I knew it would take time.\u201d A breakthrough came in 2007 when Ireland hosted England at Croke Park, a stadium steeped in republican lore, for a rugby match that came to symbolise reconciliation between both countries. There was respectful silence for God Save the Queen, thunderous singing for Amhr\u00e1n na bhFiann \u2013 and thunder again for Ireland\u2019s Call. \u201cThe song finally earned its place,\u201d said the composer. A decade later some people \u201cstill think it\u2019s a piece of shit\u201d, but history seems to be on its side, said Coulter. \u201cIt was never meant to earn a Grammy or a Pulitzer. It was calculated to be inclusive. It was a compromise.\u201d",

Now it has emerged that British Chagossians in Crawley, West Sussex, are being accommodated in lodgings about which social services have expressed serious concerns.</p> <p>A West Sussex county council social services document, seen by the <em>Observer</em>, cites the case of a child living in a Crawley hotel, location of a sizable community of British Chagossians. \u201cI am worried there are ongoing housing issues which impact on [name] having a safe and appropriate space to grow and support his development,\u201d the document, written by a social worker, states.</p> <p>The child, who turns three next month, has lived in the hotel all his life despite the accommodation being classed as temporary. Other Chagossian families with young children also claim they have been stuck there for several years. They say white British tenants are prioritised and usually given social housing after a few weeks or months.</p> <p>Calls are mounting for an inquiry into the attitude of UK authorities towards the community with local Tory MP, Henry Smith, writing to Crawley borough council \u201cexpressing significant concerns at disturbing reports in the <em>Observer</em>\u201d.</p> <p>Chai Patel, legal policy director at the <a href=\"https://www.jcwi.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants </a>said: \u201cWe need an independent investigation into how the government has been able to put these families in this appalling position, and what steps are needed to ensure it never happens again?</p> <p>\u201cThe government needs to act now to ensure that these families are able to continue their lives in the UK safely and securely. It\u2019s the least that it can do.\u201d</p> <p>The Chagossians were expelled from their homeland by Britain and exiled in Mauritius and the Seychelles, 2,000km away. In 2002 native Chagossians and their children were given the right to British passports and since then more than 3,000 have emigrated to the UK, most of them settling in Crawley.</p> <p>One of them, a mother, has begged Crawley borough council to find her more suitable accommodation and says that her family finds it difficult to live in a single room.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not an easy life. Crawley council say they can\u2019t help me. Even when I was pregnant, they didn\u2019t want to help,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Another British Chagossian and former resident claimed the hotel, which declined to comment, was \u201cnot safe \u2026 there are men living there with drink and drug problems.\u201d</p> <p>While Crawley council denies reports of mistreatment, the council\u2019s leader, Peter Lamb, has said they have investigated claims of discrimination from the Chagossian community but they were not acted on due to insufficient evidence.</p> <p>Crawley borough council said: \u201cUnlike the housing act, which limits family stays in hotel accommodation to six weeks, there is no limit under the children\u2019s act. This may explain why those families have been there for an extended period of time, and may also explain why others are being reported to have moved on more quickly. We take complaints very seriously and all are thoroughly investigated.</p> <p>\u201cWe are genuinely committed to getting to the bottom of these allegations and take appropriate steps if found to be true.\u201d</p> <p>During a meeting set up last year to air grievances from the town\u2019s Chagossian community the council spokesperson added: \u201cWe were informed that on occasion housing officers were unsympathetic to their situation, unfriendly and considered unhelpful. The council apologised if this was how officers were behaving, and a commitment was made to raise the matter with the housing department to ensure that such behaviours were addressed.\u201d</p> <p>A West Sussex county council spokesman said: \u201cIn some circumstances we support families with children who have urgent housing needs. When this happens we make every effort to find a suitable placement. As temporary accommodation is not best suited to meet longer term needs, we work with a family to identify accommodation that meets the children\u2019s needs as soon as we can.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Families descended from islanders evicted from the Chagos Islands are being housed in council-allocated accommodation deemed by social services to be inappropriate for young children, the Observer has learned. The latest revelations prompted fresh calls for an independent investigation into the treatment of British Chagossians, forcibly removed by the UK in the 1960s and early 70s to allow the US military to establish a base on the largest island, Diego Garcia. Last month the Observer revealed British passport holders from the Chagos Islands were being systematically targeted by council officials to get them removed from the UK. Now it has emerged that British Chagossians in Crawley, West Sussex, are being accommodated in lodgings about which social services have expressed serious concerns. A West Sussex county council social services document, seen by the Observer, cites the case of a child living in a Crawley hotel, location of a sizable community of British Chagossians. \u201cI am worried there are ongoing housing issues which impact on [name] having a safe and appropriate space to grow and support his development,\u201d the document, written by a social worker, states. The child, who turns three next month, has lived in the hotel all his life despite the accommodation being classed as temporary. Other Chagossian families with young children also claim they have been stuck there for several years. They say white British tenants are prioritised and usually given social housing after a few weeks or months. Calls are mounting for an inquiry into the attitude of UK authorities towards the community with local Tory MP, Henry Smith, writing to Crawley borough council \u201cexpressing significant concerns at disturbing reports in the Observer\u201d. Chai Patel, legal policy director at the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants said: \u201cWe need an independent investigation into how the government has been able to put these families in this appalling position, and what steps are needed to ensure it never happens again? \u201cThe government needs to act now to ensure that these families are able to continue their lives in the UK safely and securely. It\u2019s the least that it can do.\u201d The Chagossians were expelled from their homeland by Britain and exiled in Mauritius and the Seychelles, 2,000km away. In 2002 native Chagossians and their children were given the right to British passports and since then more than 3,000 have emigrated to the UK, most of them settling in Crawley. One of them, a mother, has begged Crawley borough council to find her more suitable accommodation and says that her family finds it difficult to live in a single room. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy life. Crawley council say they can\u2019t help me. Even when I was pregnant, they didn\u2019t want to help,\u201d she said. Another British Chagossian and former resident claimed the hotel, which declined to comment, was \u201cnot safe \u2026 there are men living there with drink and drug problems.\u201d While Crawley council denies reports of mistreatment, the council\u2019s leader, Peter Lamb, has said they have investigated claims of discrimination from the Chagossian community but they were not acted on due to insufficient evidence. Crawley borough council said: \u201cUnlike the housing act, which limits family stays in hotel accommodation to six weeks, there is no limit under the children\u2019s act. This may explain why those families have been there for an extended period of time, and may also explain why others are being reported to have moved on more quickly. We take complaints very seriously and all are thoroughly investigated. \u201cWe are genuinely committed to getting to the bottom of these allegations and take appropriate steps if found to be true.\u201d During a meeting set up last year to air grievances from the town\u2019s Chagossian community the council spokesperson added: \u201cWe were informed that on occasion housing officers were unsympathetic to their situation, unfriendly and considered unhelpful. The council apologised if this was how officers were behaving, and a commitment was made to raise the matter with the housing department to ensure that such behaviours were addressed.\u201d A West Sussex county council spokesman said: \u201cIn some circumstances we support families with children who have urgent housing needs. When this happens we make every effort to find a suitable placement. As temporary accommodation is not best suited to meet longer term needs, we work with a family to identify accommodation that meets the children\u2019s needs as soon as we can.\u201d",

However, no British minors have since been removed, with a Foreign Office spokesperson saying that \u201cthere are things we cannot do because we do not have a consular presence within Syria\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Anyone seeking information on Graham Potter\u2019s route to the top flight has a veritable library to refer to. A pound for every time he has been asked about the team-building exercises he fostered at \u00d6stersunds would make him richer than, say, a Premier League manager but more afternoons like this will guarantee his football is the only thing remotely worth discussing. This was some debut for Potter, whose Brighton side produced exactly the kind of proactive, inventive performance the club had sought on recruiting him from Swansea. They cruised home through an own goal from Abdoulaye Doucour\u00e9 and clinical finishes from the substitutes Florin Andone and Neal Maupay. The pair justified his decision to keep hounding a muddled Watford, who won the same fixture 2-0 on last year\u2019s opening day but were outclassed this time. It all bodes well given that Potter, who spent \u00a360m over the summer, fielded a starting lineup that entirely comprised players who were at the club last season. The same men who looked taut and inhibited towards the end of Chris Hughton\u2019s reign radiated purpose here, Dale Stephens among those appreciative of greater freedom to pick his attacking moments. They were composed and methodical, exuding comfort in a 3-4-2-1 system and responding to Potter\u2019s calls for greater aggression. \u201cI thought the players were fantastic,\u201d he said. \u201cThey tried their best to do what we asked them to do. We weren\u2019t perfect. I wouldn\u2019t expect that. But it was probably a reward for all the work the guys have done for the past few weeks.\u201d If Brighton were not flawless, then Watford barely got anything right. They could not blame the swirling winds, which if anything should have played greater havoc with Brighton\u2019s possession-based approach. After a brisk start they became maddeningly imprecise and it was no shock when they fell behind. The goal summed up both sides\u2019 levels of execution, Craig Dawson conceding the ball to Stephens and allowing Brighton to spring forward. Eventually Stephens produced a delivery that looped to Pascal Gross beyond the far post. Doucour\u00e9 needed to get something on the volley across goal that followed but all he could manage was a snick that sent the ball fizzing past Foster. In the second half Andre Gray was thwarted by Mat Ryan\u2019s legs, spurring a spell of pressure that ended with a VAR check when Roberto Pereyra\u2019s free-kick slammed into an initially indeterminate part of the wall\u2019s anatomy. Brighton survived, freshened up and sealed the points. Rather than settling for a rearguard action, Potter sent on two forwards and Andone clipped in smartly at the near post within a minute. Maupay, a \u00a316m signing from Brentford, then ran through to finish from an angle and Brighton\u2019s initiative got what it deserved. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a good wake-up call for the rest of the season,\u201d said Javi Gracia, who surely cannot wait for Watford\u2019s major new signings, Ismaila Sarr and Danny Welbeck, to be ready for action.

That\u2019s the Premier League for you. A league of excess, a league of extremes. Who has it right? At this stage of the season nobody knows anything.",

Fabrizio Piscitelli, 53, was well-known because, for almost 30 years, he had been the undisputed boss of Italy\u2019s toughest ultra gang, Lazio\u2019s Irriducibili (\u201cthe Irreducibles\u201d or \u201cDie Hards\u201d). He was nicknamed \u201cDiabolik\u201d, after a cartoon thief and assassin.</p> <p>Shortly before 7pm, a man dressed as a jogger \u2013 wearing a cap and neck-scarf \u2013 ran past the bench and fired a 7.65 calibre pistol into Piscitelli\u2019s left ear. He died almost instantly, sliding off the bench as the murderer ran off. It had all the hallmarks of a professional hit.</p> <p>The murder brought to a close one of the most incredible careers in the history of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/01/nside-talys-ultras-the-dangerous-fans-who-control-the-game\" title=\"\">Lazio\u2019s ultras</a>. The club\u2019s fanbase has always been very politicised: during Italy\u2019s \u201cyears of lead\u201d (its extremist terrorism) in the 1970s, it was very common to see, among the white-and-sky-blue colours of Lazio supporters, many of Benito Mussolini\u2019s symbols. It was an era in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/29/beyond-the-violence-shocking-power-ultras-wield-over-italian-football\" title=\"\">Lazio ultras</a> became both victims and perpetrators of political assassinations.</p> <p>That was the turbulent decade in which Piscitelli first went to the stadium. But it was a period of sporting decline: the team\u2019s glorious 1974 <em>scudetto</em> (meaning it had won the Serie A championship) was fading from view, and soon match-fixing scandals would relegate the team to Serie B and, almost, to C.</p> <p>Piscitelli wasn\u2019t overly interested in football, though. By the time he was in his teens, the real match was with rival ultras. He was a street-fighter. \u201cFor the good of Lazio,\u201d he once said, \u201cwe were looking to injure people on the other side, we wanted to go onto the terraces and kill them.\u201d Fighting, he said, made him \u201cfeel alive in a world of the dead\u201d.</p> <p>By the mid-1980s, Lazio\u2019s predominant firm, the Eagles, seemed too sedate for Piscitelli and the other teenagers who were hanging out with a graphic designer called Grinta (\u201cGrit\u201d). In 1987, Grinta and his tearaways founded a new crew, the Irriducibili, using as their symbol a bowler-hatted character called Mr Enrich swinging a kick. They fought the Eagles for terrace supremacy, easily getting to the centre of the <em>curva </em>(the curved terrace) by the tactic of being willing to use far more violence than their rivals.</p> <p>It was fortunate timing. Lazio enjoyed a revival in the 1990s. The club signed world-class players like Beppe Signori and Paul Gascoigne. It was taken over by a wealthy entrepreneur, Sergio Cragnotti. Guided by the Swedish manager, Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson, Lazio won its second <em>scudetto</em> as well as a Uefa Cup and two Italian cup finals.</p> <p>Suddenly there was a lot of money in both football and, specifically, in Lazio. Ultra firms had always produced stickers, scarves, badges, fanzines and shirts to subsidise their choreographies, rent and travel, but the Irriducibili took it to another level. They rented warehouses, opened franchises and became experts at using the stadium to publicise their political, and sartorial, pose. Their slogans and stunts always made the papers, and often the television. Seeing the amount of money to be made, Piscitelli deposed Grinta as the leader of the Irriducibili and turned the cottage industry into a business empire called Original Fans.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d82e7fea06d48e4131004a0260766be94988f65b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d82e7fea06d48e4131004a0260766be94988f65b/0_0_670_964/348.jpg\" alt=\"Fabrizio Piscitelli, aka Diabolik.\" width=\"348\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fabrizio Piscitelli, aka Diabolik.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Il Tempo.it</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At its peak, Original Fans had 12 outlets. The turnover was largely cash-in-hand so precise figures are hard to come by, but Piscitelli became a millionaire. (An estate of \u20ac2.3m was confiscated from him in 2016). The deeply offensive extremism of the Irriducibili helped brand the Original Fans label. Swastikas, Roman salutes, antisemitism, hanging mannequins from bridges, plastering Anne Frank stickers as insults, singing the national anthem during silences for drowned migrants \u2026 the Irriducibili were always in the news and began attracting thousands of recruits from far-right parties like Forza Nuova. All adherents, of course, had to pay a subscription and purchase the right clobber. \u201cIf Piscitelli weren\u2019t a gangster,\u201d a Lazio supporter told me once outside the Stadio Olimpico, \u201che could have been a CEO.\u201d</p> <p>Piscitelli was charismatic: he could be pally and charming, and when in his company you felt you were at the court of a cheeky king. But he could turn nasty in a flash. An acquaintance of his remembers: \u201cHe would suddenly say things like \u2018let\u2019s fucking shoot him\u2019 and you didn\u2019t know if he was serious or kidding.\u201d</p> <p>At the height of his power, Piscitelli could get anyone he wanted into the stadium (even, very showily, himself despite one of his many stadium bans). Another Lazio ultra (scornful of the incessant fascism of the Irriducibili) says that for many years \u201cPiscitelli could do whatever he wanted\u201d. A police union representative once complained, on TV, that the <em>capo-ultr\u00e0</em> was introduced into certain police corridors that were closed even to him, the official rep.</p> <p>Income and connections made the Irriducibili very powerful. Toffolo, another leader of the group, once boasted of being a trade union leader: \u201cI represent 15,000 people,\u201d he said. There was absolute unity in the ranks: four huge speakers were installed in the <em>curva </em><em>nord</em> so that everyone was forced to follow the leader. Spontaneity was punished; dress codes imposed. \u201cNo one would ever dare be arrogant here,\u201d one of the leaders once told me, \u201cbecause we\u2019re a military organisation.\u201d The group organised riots to stop tax debts being imposed on Lazio by the Italian government. It boycotted newspapers. It even attempted to take over Lazio itself, financed by money from organised crime and using Lazio\u2019s Italo-Welsh legend, Giorgio Chinaglia, as a frontman.</p> <p>Piscitelli was taking increasing risks. He had moved from merchandising into drug dealing, using his connections to the Neapolitan mob, the Camorra. His <em>batteria</em> (turf) was the Ponte Milvio suburb just north of the Stadio Olimpico. By then the violence had moved far beyond terrace fisticuffs: Toffolo was twice knee-capped by unknowns, and the leg of one Irriducibili, having been chainsawn off, was found in a tributary to the river Tiber (his body was never found). Piscitelli was accused of handling hundreds of kilos of narcotics and was eventually arrested in 2015 after police followed a pizza delivery boy to a remote warehouse. Piscitelli\u2019s hideout contained axes, swords, truncheons, a pistol and phone-jammers.</p> <p>He was first imprisoned and then placed under house arrest. His villas were confiscated. Other ultra groups, such as Hit Firm, were snapping at his heels. With years of court appearances pending, Piscitelli tried to make a comeback. He made peace with Claudio Lotito, the Lazio chairman against whom he had plotted for so long. There were more stunts, like Roman salutes honouring Mussolini in Milan this spring, and a comuniqu\u00e9 in which women were banned from the front 10 rows. It all generated news and Piscitelli openly spoke about his hope for a return to the \u201cyears of lead\u201d.</p> <p>But by then his power, and health, were on the wane. Ironically for a terrace in which the far-right fans forbid recreational drug-use, Piscitelli was, for much of his life, an avid drugs user. In a 2002 BBC documentary about Lazio\u2019s ultras, he happily rolled a joint while simultaneously driving his car around the stadium. That drugs use didn\u2019t add to his emotional stability. One psychiatric report (admittedly prepared by his defence team, in the hope of avoiding a custodial sentence) portrayed a man who was prone to frequent bouts of psychosis, paranoia and delusion. . Perhaps, in the end, his criminal contacts simply thought it was safer to have him out of the way.</p> <p>The Irriducibili is still intimidating. No Lazio ultra will go on the record to speak ill of the deceased. But one lifelong fan summed up, more bluntly than most, what many Laziali said in private last week: \u201cPiscitelli ruined the image of Lazio in the world. Lazio now implies racism, fascism and collusion with the Camorra. His was a rabble of criminals.\u201d Diabolik, it\u2019s clear, took fandom far beyond the football.</p> <p><em>Tobias Jones\u2019s new book, Ultra, </em><em>is published </em><em>on 19 September by Head of Zeus</em></p> <h2>Who are the ultras?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fef83224d6b5050e6a83662f7d622c5996b088bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fef83224d6b5050e6a83662f7d622c5996b088bd/0_0_4256_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"SS Lazio ultras clash with riot police at the end of the Serie A match between SS Lazio and AS Roma in 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">SS Lazio ultras clash with riot police at the end of the Serie A match between SS Lazio and AS Roma in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefano Montesi/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u2022<em> </em>In the late 60s and early 70s, teenage football fans rebelled against Italy\u2019s sedate supporters\u2019 clubs and went to stand, and sing, behind the goal.

Seeing the amount of money to be made, Piscitelli deposed Grinta as the leader of the Irriducibili and turned the cottage industry into a business empire called Original Fans. At its peak, Original Fans had 12 outlets. The turnover was largely cash-in-hand so precise figures are hard to come by, but Piscitelli became a millionaire. (An estate of \u20ac2.3m was confiscated from him in 2016). The deeply offensive extremism of the Irriducibili helped brand the Original Fans label. Swastikas, Roman salutes, antisemitism, hanging mannequins from bridges, plastering Anne Frank stickers as insults, singing the national anthem during silences for drowned migrants \u2026 the Irriducibili were always in the news and began attracting thousands of recruits from far-right parties like Forza Nuova. All adherents, of course, had to pay a subscription and purchase the right clobber. \u201cIf Piscitelli weren\u2019t a gangster,\u201d a Lazio supporter told me once outside the Stadio Olimpico, \u201che could have been a CEO.\u201d Piscitelli was charismatic: he could be pally and charming, and when in his company you felt you were at the court of a cheeky king. But he could turn nasty in a flash. An acquaintance of his remembers: \u201cHe would suddenly say things like \u2018let\u2019s fucking shoot him\u2019 and you didn\u2019t know if he was serious or kidding.\u201d At the height of his power, Piscitelli could get anyone he wanted into the stadium (even, very showily, himself despite one of his many stadium bans). Another Lazio ultra (scornful of the incessant fascism of the Irriducibili) says that for many years \u201cPiscitelli could do whatever he wanted\u201d. A police union representative once complained, on TV, that the capo-ultr\u00e0 was introduced into certain police corridors that were closed even to him, the official rep. Income and connections made the Irriducibili very powerful. Toffolo, another leader of the group, once boasted of being a trade union leader: \u201cI represent 15,000 people,\u201d he said. There was absolute unity in the ranks: four huge speakers were installed in the curva nord so that everyone was forced to follow the leader. Spontaneity was punished; dress codes imposed. \u201cNo one would ever dare be arrogant here,\u201d one of the leaders once told me, \u201cbecause we\u2019re a military organisation.\u201d The group organised riots to stop tax debts being imposed on Lazio by the Italian government. It boycotted newspapers. It even attempted to take over Lazio itself, financed by money from organised crime and using Lazio\u2019s Italo-Welsh legend, Giorgio Chinaglia, as a frontman. Piscitelli was taking increasing risks. He had moved from merchandising into drug dealing, using his connections to the Neapolitan mob, the Camorra. His batteria (turf) was the Ponte Milvio suburb just north of the Stadio Olimpico. By then the violence had moved far beyond terrace fisticuffs: Toffolo was twice knee-capped by unknowns, and the leg of one Irriducibili, having been chainsawn off, was found in a tributary to the river Tiber (his body was never found). Piscitelli was accused of handling hundreds of kilos of narcotics and was eventually arrested in 2015 after police followed a pizza delivery boy to a remote warehouse. Piscitelli\u2019s hideout contained axes, swords, truncheons, a pistol and phone-jammers. He was first imprisoned and then placed under house arrest. His villas were confiscated. Other ultra groups, such as Hit Firm, were snapping at his heels. With years of court appearances pending, Piscitelli tried to make a comeback. He made peace with Claudio Lotito, the Lazio chairman against whom he had plotted for so long. There were more stunts, like Roman salutes honouring Mussolini in Milan this spring, and a comuniqu\u00e9 in which women were banned from the front 10 rows. It all generated news and Piscitelli openly spoke about his hope for a return to the \u201cyears of lead\u201d. But by then his power, and health, were on the wane. Ironically for a terrace in which the far-right fans forbid recreational drug-use, Piscitelli was, for much of his life, an avid drugs user. In a 2002 BBC documentary about Lazio\u2019s ultras, he happily rolled a joint while simultaneously driving his car around the stadium. That drugs use didn\u2019t add to his emotional stability. One psychiatric report (admittedly prepared by his defence team, in the hope of avoiding a custodial sentence) portrayed a man who was prone to frequent bouts of psychosis, paranoia and delusion. . Perhaps, in the end, his criminal contacts simply thought it was safer to have him out of the way. The Irriducibili is still intimidating. No Lazio ultra will go on the record to speak ill of the deceased. But one lifelong fan summed up, more bluntly than most, what many Laziali said in private last week: \u201cPiscitelli ruined the image of Lazio in the world. Lazio now implies racism, fascism and collusion with the Camorra. His was a rabble of criminals.\u201d Diabolik, it\u2019s clear, took fandom far beyond the football. Tobias Jones\u2019s new book, Ultra, is published on 19 September by Head of Zeus Who are the ultras? \u2022 In the late 60s and early 70s, teenage football fans rebelled against Italy\u2019s sedate supporters\u2019 clubs and went to stand, and sing, behind the goal. They\u2019ve been compared to punks and Hells Angels. \u2022 The word \u201cultra\u201d implies \u201cextreme\u201d, \u201cbeyond\u201d or \u201cother\u201d. \u2022 At its foundation, the movement was largely far-left, with names inspired by global partisan struggles. Petty criminals and political extremists were drawn to the terraces\u2019 carnival atmosphere and the huge customer base. Most ultra groups are now fascist in inspiration and many have overlapped with organised crime. \u2022 Ultras are comparable to, but different from, British football hooligans. They relish drinking and fighting, but are much more hierarchical and disciplined, with a sober strategic analysis of the group\u2019s sporting, and economic, interests. \u2022 Despite their reputation, there are ultra groups that are inspiring, charitable and inclusive.",

      "body": "<p>Nathan Lyon has not been as vociferous at the start of this Ashes series as he was before the last one in November 2017. There has been no need and maybe there really is a return to the brave old world when Australia respected their opponents. Back in Brisbane two years ago Lyon was the cheerleader on the welcoming committee, talking of English batsmen \u201crunning scared\u201d, of a determination to \u201chead-butt the line\u201d and of an Aussie team eager to \u201cend careers\u201d. \u201cI didn\u2019t end any careers,\u201d he said. \u201cMitchell Johnson ended them.\u201d</p> <p>There is a suggestion that Lyon might just have ended the career of one of England\u2019s most cherished Test cricketers, Moeen Ali, who has been dropped from the team after one match in the series. At Edgbaston Moeen, a few miles from his home, cut a sad, forlorn figure. Suddenly he was playing an alien game; nothing worked. And Lyon was Moeen\u2019s great tormentor.</p> <p>Lyon dismissed Moeen for nought and four, which merely confirmed his hold over him. This meant that in his past 11 innings against Australia Moeen had been dismissed by Lyon nine times. In those matches he has averaged 16, a paltry return for a man who could boast \u2013 though he never would \u2013 five Test centuries.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/10/australia-mitchell-starc-fast-bowlers-ashes-lords\">Australia\u2019s cupboard is full of fast bowlers, says Mitchell Starc</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet it was not Moeen\u2019s batting that led to his omission. It was the gulf between the two off-spinners that prompted Ed Smith and his fellow selectors to make such a swift change. At Edgbaston the ball began to turn as the match progressed, just as it should on a good Test pitch, and it was here that Lyon highlighted Moeen\u2019s current frailties.</p> <p>In the second innings Lyon was ruthlessly clinical as he fizzed down his off-breaks, allowing the batsmen no respite. Conditions were in his favour and he was going to take advantage. The batsmen were dispatched in the classical manner. Jason Roy, a little generously, allowed himself to be bowled through the gate. Joe Denly and Joe Root were snaffled at bat/pad, while the left-handers were gobbled up as perfectly pitched deliveries found the outside edges of bats dutifully defending: six for 49 from 20 overs.</p> <p>Moeen, by contrast, had faltered. He had bowled perfectly adequately during Australia\u2019s first innings in support of the seamers but in the second, when he was meant to be the major threat, he could impose no pressure on the batsmen. There were some unnecessarily quirky fields set, especially against Steve Smith, which did not help. However, in these conditions he should have been able to test the left-handers far more \u2013 and there are four of them in their first six.</p> <p>His length was inconsistent and so was his action. Sometimes he even used two different actions in the same over, a bad sign. One had his right arm braced like a darts player before he entered his delivery stride; the other, which looks more natural and fluid, had his right arm by his side.</p> <p>These were the visible signs that all was not well. The numbers were telling, too. In that second innings, which began with Australia under pressure to try to save the game, Moeen bowled 29 overs, taking two for 130. Root and Denly, part-timers, were required to bowl 26 overs between them. It was Moeen\u2019s bowling in that second innings that prompted his omission.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14216e14438c6a8f1634b7ba6658547cd4e6f6a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14216e14438c6a8f1634b7ba6658547cd4e6f6a1/0_0_2362_1223/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Moeen Ali is caught by Australia\u2019s David Warner off the bowling of Lyon during England\u2019s second-innings collapse in the first Test.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"518\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Moeen Ali is caught by Australia\u2019s David Warner off the bowling of Lyon during England\u2019s second-innings collapse in the first Test.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This need not be the end for him. Moeen has played 60 Tests for England and has taken 181 wickets; only Derek Underwood, Graeme Swann and Jim Laker among English spinners have more. In his self-deprecating way Moeen has been a stalwart of the side for the past five years. He can return, though it is hard to see how he can do so quickly. He needs time to breathe and to restore his game away from the Test arena, which is difficult to do this season as Worcestershire have only one Championship match before the Ashes conclude.</p> <p>Next year the domestic schedule will be so distorted, with two short-form competitions in mid-summer, that the impediments for any player trying to recover form before a Test match will be greater still. It seems odd that those in charge, Ashley Giles and Smith, appear so sanguine about the situation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>At Lord\u2019s Moeen\u2019s replacement will be Jack Leach, who has hardly had the ideal preparation for his first Ashes Test: he has bowled three fruitless overs \u2013 against Ireland \u2013 in the past month. Hence expectations of Leach\u2019s impact should be tempered as the two teams assemble. He is one of several English players each compelled to rediscover his form during the game.</p> <p>England\u2019s squad has shrunk significantly since Edgbaston, where 14 men were gathered. Leach has been summoned but with Jimmy Anderson and Olly Stone injured and Moeen dropped there are only 12 to choose from, including Jofra Archer, who confirmed his fitness by playing against an inexperienced Gloucestershire second XI.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/aug/07/the-ashes-five-things-england-bounce-back\">The Ashes: five things England can do to bounce back | Tim de Lisle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The twelfth man \u2013 in decreasing order of likelihood \u2013 will be one of Sam Curran, Jack Leach and Joe Denly. After the Ireland Test there will be much staring at the surface and a certain nervousness in the belly of the new groundsman, Karl McDermott, since Root declared his last Test pitch \u201csubstandard\u201d.</p> <p>Meanwhile a buoyant Australian party have plenty to choose from. They have the option of recalling the mighty Mitchell Starc on a ground well suited to left-armers or Josh Hazlewood; or they could stick with the Edgbaston quartet, an enviable selection conundrum especially when England\u2019s resources are diminishing so rapidly.</p> <p>Australia struggled for runs at the top of the order in the first Test but the performances of Travis Head and Matthew Wade were especially reassuring.</p> <p>So, too, was Smith, whose constant presence at the crease will have occupied England\u2019s backroom staff. Magic formulas and strange field placements probably play into his hands. England need to perform the basics better when bowling at him and to make him work harder for his runs \u2013 with the odd bouncer.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Nathan Lyon has not been as vociferous at the start of this Ashes series as he was before the last one in November 2017. There has been no need and maybe there really is a return to the brave old world when Australia respected their opponents. Back in Brisbane two years ago Lyon was the cheerleader on the welcoming committee, talking of English batsmen \u201crunning scared\u201d, of a determination to \u201chead-butt the line\u201d and of an Aussie team eager to \u201cend careers\u201d. \u201cI didn\u2019t end any careers,\u201d he said. \u201cMitchell Johnson ended them.\u201d There is a suggestion that Lyon might just have ended the career of one of England\u2019s most cherished Test cricketers, Moeen Ali, who has been dropped from the team after one match in the series. At Edgbaston Moeen, a few miles from his home, cut a sad, forlorn figure. Suddenly he was playing an alien game; nothing worked. And Lyon was Moeen\u2019s great tormentor. Lyon dismissed Moeen for nought and four, which merely confirmed his hold over him. This meant that in his past 11 innings against Australia Moeen had been dismissed by Lyon nine times. In those matches he has averaged 16, a paltry return for a man who could boast \u2013 though he never would \u2013 five Test centuries. Yet it was not Moeen\u2019s batting that led to his omission. It was the gulf between the two off-spinners that prompted Ed Smith and his fellow selectors to make such a swift change. At Edgbaston the ball began to turn as the match progressed, just as it should on a good Test pitch, and it was here that Lyon highlighted Moeen\u2019s current frailties. In the second innings Lyon was ruthlessly clinical as he fizzed down his off-breaks, allowing the batsmen no respite. Conditions were in his favour and he was going to take advantage. The batsmen were dispatched in the classical manner. Jason Roy, a little generously, allowed himself to be bowled through the gate. Joe Denly and Joe Root were snaffled at bat/pad, while the left-handers were gobbled up as perfectly pitched deliveries found the outside edges of bats dutifully defending: six for 49 from 20 overs. Moeen, by contrast, had faltered. He had bowled perfectly adequately during Australia\u2019s first innings in support of the seamers but in the second, when he was meant to be the major threat, he could impose no pressure on the batsmen. There were some unnecessarily quirky fields set, especially against Steve Smith, which did not help. However, in these conditions he should have been able to test the left-handers far more \u2013 and there are four of them in their first six. His length was inconsistent and so was his action. Sometimes he even used two different actions in the same over, a bad sign. One had his right arm braced like a darts player before he entered his delivery stride; the other, which looks more natural and fluid, had his right arm by his side. These were the visible signs that all was not well. The numbers were telling, too. In that second innings, which began with Australia under pressure to try to save the game, Moeen bowled 29 overs, taking two for 130. Root and Denly, part-timers, were required to bowl 26 overs between them. It was Moeen\u2019s bowling in that second innings that prompted his omission. This need not be the end for him. Moeen has played 60 Tests for England and has taken 181 wickets; only Derek Underwood, Graeme Swann and Jim Laker among English spinners have more. In his self-deprecating way Moeen has been a stalwart of the side for the past five years. He can return, though it is hard to see how he can do so quickly. He needs time to breathe and to restore his game away from the Test arena, which is difficult to do this season as Worcestershire have only one Championship match before the Ashes conclude. Next year the domestic schedule will be so distorted, with two short-form competitions in mid-summer, that the impediments for any player trying to recover form before a Test match will be greater still. It seems odd that those in charge, Ashley Giles and Smith, appear so sanguine about the situation. At Lord\u2019s Moeen\u2019s replacement will be Jack Leach, who has hardly had the ideal preparation for his first Ashes Test: he has bowled three fruitless overs \u2013 against Ireland \u2013 in the past month. Hence expectations of Leach\u2019s impact should be tempered as the two teams assemble. He is one of several English players each compelled to rediscover his form during the game. England\u2019s squad has shrunk significantly since Edgbaston, where 14 men were gathered. Leach has been summoned but with Jimmy Anderson and Olly Stone injured and Moeen dropped there are only 12 to choose from, including Jofra Archer, who confirmed his fitness by playing against an inexperienced Gloucestershire second XI. The twelfth man \u2013 in decreasing order of likelihood \u2013 will be one of Sam Curran, Jack Leach and Joe Denly. After the Ireland Test there will be much staring at the surface and a certain nervousness in the belly of the new groundsman, Karl McDermott, since Root declared his last Test pitch \u201csubstandard\u201d. Meanwhile a buoyant Australian party have plenty to choose from. They have the option of recalling the mighty Mitchell Starc on a ground well suited to left-armers or Josh Hazlewood; or they could stick with the Edgbaston quartet, an enviable selection conundrum especially when England\u2019s resources are diminishing so rapidly. Australia struggled for runs at the top of the order in the first Test but the performances of Travis Head and Matthew Wade were especially reassuring. So, too, was Smith, whose constant presence at the crease will have occupied England\u2019s backroom staff. Magic formulas and strange field placements probably play into his hands. England need to perform the basics better when bowling at him and to make him work harder for his runs \u2013 with the odd bouncer.",

      "body": "<p>On a lazy Sunday morning in May last year, Isobel Lloyd was at her boyfriend\u2019s house, having coffee with his mum. The conversation had worked around to Lloyd\u2019s grandma \u2013 her mother\u2019s mother \u2013 who\u2019d died in her 50s, when Lloyd was very young. Lloyd\u2019s only memories of her had been hospice visits where her grandma lay bedbound, unable to talk or swallow, with no control over how her body moved. Lloyd had forgotten the name of her grandma\u2019s disease, hadn\u2019t thought about it in years. Like most 20-year-olds, she was future-focused \u2013 a student from Yorkshire, keen on her studies, in love with her boyfriend of four years.</p> <p>Sitting in his family kitchen, they began reeling off degenerative diseases. Motor neurone. Multiple sclerosis. Parkinson\u2019s. Alzheimer\u2019s. Then finally Huntington\u2019s disease (HD). In a flash of recognition, Lloyd knew that was the one her grandma had. \u201cIt just clicked,\u201d she says. \u201cI Googled it on my phone \u2013 and that\u2019s when I read that it was genetic. My mum had a 50% risk of getting it \u2013 and if she did, I had a 50% risk, too.\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t tell her boyfriend\u2019s mother what she\u2019d just learned, \u201cBut I felt the colour rush out of my face,\u201d says Lloyd, an only child. \u201cI thought, \u2018No way, that can\u2019t be true.\u2019 I was 20 years old and no one had told me?\u201d</p> <p>In fact, that\u2019s not so unusual. Secrecy, evasion and lies are frequent features for families grappling with genetic disease. Whether it\u2019s HD, a breast cancer gene, inheritable bowel cancer, early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s, it\u2019s not uncommon for younger generations to stumble upon their inheritance by noticing patterns, asking questions. By then, they\u2019re faced not just with their frightening at-risk status, but also anger at all those years in the dark.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People start saying they don\u2019t want their children to worry</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This subject forms the heart of a new novel by Alice Peterson, who has a record of creating popular fiction from hard-hitting subjects like disability or addiction. In <em>If You Were Here</em>, 26-year-old Flo is newly engaged and about to emigrate when her grandma tells her that she might carry the HD gene. The book weaves three voices \u2013 Flo\u2019s, her grandma\u2019s and diaries of Flo\u2019s mother, who had died years earlier. Together, they explore the reasons for keeping secrets, the constant agonising over when and how to pass on devastating information to the people we love most \u2013 and the cost of putting it off.</p> <p>Peterson came to the subject after meeting a friend of her mother\u2019s who had tested positive for the HD gene. \u201cShe was in her 50s, very brave, so stoic but the key thing was when she said, \u2018I haven\u2019t yet told my son,\u2019\u201d says Peterson. \u201cShe was a single mother of an only child \u2013 he was in his 20s. She said that telling him was the hardest thing she\u2019d ever had to do.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s an issue made more pertinent by a lawsuit due to be heard this autumn. In the first of its kind, an anonymous claimant is <a href=\"https://www.1cor.com/london/2018/01/09/must-the-family-be-told/\" title=\"\">suing</a> St George\u2019s NHS Trust for failing to inform her of her HD risk.

      "bodyText": "On a lazy Sunday morning in May last year, Isobel Lloyd was at her boyfriend\u2019s house, having coffee with his mum. The conversation had worked around to Lloyd\u2019s grandma \u2013 her mother\u2019s mother \u2013 who\u2019d died in her 50s, when Lloyd was very young. Lloyd\u2019s only memories of her had been hospice visits where her grandma lay bedbound, unable to talk or swallow, with no control over how her body moved. Lloyd had forgotten the name of her grandma\u2019s disease, hadn\u2019t thought about it in years. Like most 20-year-olds, she was future-focused \u2013 a student from Yorkshire, keen on her studies, in love with her boyfriend of four years. Sitting in his family kitchen, they began reeling off degenerative diseases. Motor neurone. Multiple sclerosis. Parkinson\u2019s. Alzheimer\u2019s. Then finally Huntington\u2019s disease (HD). In a flash of recognition, Lloyd knew that was the one her grandma had. \u201cIt just clicked,\u201d she says. \u201cI Googled it on my phone \u2013 and that\u2019s when I read that it was genetic. My mum had a 50% risk of getting it \u2013 and if she did, I had a 50% risk, too.\u201d She didn\u2019t tell her boyfriend\u2019s mother what she\u2019d just learned, \u201cBut I felt the colour rush out of my face,\u201d says Lloyd, an only child. \u201cI thought, \u2018No way, that can\u2019t be true.\u2019 I was 20 years old and no one had told me?\u201d In fact, that\u2019s not so unusual. Secrecy, evasion and lies are frequent features for families grappling with genetic disease. Whether it\u2019s HD, a breast cancer gene, inheritable bowel cancer, early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s, it\u2019s not uncommon for younger generations to stumble upon their inheritance by noticing patterns, asking questions. By then, they\u2019re faced not just with their frightening at-risk status, but also anger at all those years in the dark. This subject forms the heart of a new novel by Alice Peterson, who has a record of creating popular fiction from hard-hitting subjects like disability or addiction. In If You Were Here, 26-year-old Flo is newly engaged and about to emigrate when her grandma tells her that she might carry the HD gene. The book weaves three voices \u2013 Flo\u2019s, her grandma\u2019s and diaries of Flo\u2019s mother, who had died years earlier. Together, they explore the reasons for keeping secrets, the constant agonising over when and how to pass on devastating information to the people we love most \u2013 and the cost of putting it off. Peterson came to the subject after meeting a friend of her mother\u2019s who had tested positive for the HD gene. \u201cShe was in her 50s, very brave, so stoic but the key thing was when she said, \u2018I haven\u2019t yet told my son,\u2019\u201d says Peterson. \u201cShe was a single mother of an only child \u2013 he was in his 20s. She said that telling him was the hardest thing she\u2019d ever had to do.\u201d It\u2019s an issue made more pertinent by a lawsuit due to be heard this autumn. In the first of its kind, an anonymous claimant is suing St George\u2019s NHS Trust for failing to inform her of her HD risk. Her father, a St George\u2019s patient, had HD and refused to let doctors tell his family \u2013 his daughter was pregnant and he feared she\u2019d have a termination. She went on to have the child and has since tested positive for HD \u2013 so her daughter has a 50% chance of inheriting it, too. Although \u201cdoctor-patient confidentiality\u201d has until now been sacrosanct, the claimant is arguing that her father\u2019s doctors had a duty of care to inform her, regardless of his wishes. Charlotte Tomlinson, a genetic counsellor with Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019, has many concerns about its implications. There\u2019s the practical question of how to locate and inform family members (and where do you stop? First generation? Second?)

      "body": "<p>There is a lot to do in Manhattan \u2013 but shopping? Maybe not so much these days. Once one of the hottest markets on the planet, New York\u2019s retail sector is suffering.</p> <p>Surveying the empty storefronts on Fifth Avenue, holidaymaker Gill Stewart, from Stokesley in Yorkshire, said she was surprised by the number of vacancies. \u201cWe\u2019ve come across a few places that are empty or under refurbishment, certainly many more than we expected,\u201d she said. As the family wondered which direction to go in, Stewart noted that her teenage children, Nathan and Eleanor, weren\u2019t even clamouring to visit the shops. </p> <p>Her daughter confirmed that the focus of their New York experience was shifting. \u201cIn the past, we\u2019ve bought things without the intention of shopping,\u201d Eleanor said. \u201cOn this trip we haven\u2019t unexpectedly got anything.\u201d</p> <p>Attitudes like that should give New York\u2019s retailers and legislators pause for thought. The city is by far the largest tourist destination in the US, and whether that is for sightseeing or shopping, the decline of the Manhattan consumer experience could limit the city\u2019s appeal.</p> <p>On Fifth Avenue, Vince Wang and his family, visiting from Shanghai, said China had also been hit by a retail downturn, but it was a surprise to find the same trend in Manhattan. \u201cChinese who shop for luxury goods often do so in the US or Europe, but compared to 10 years ago a lot of shops have disappeared,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The striking deterioration of some of Manhattan\u2019s most popular shopping districts was underscored by the decision on Monday by Barneys, the city\u2019s famous fashion emporium, to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/06/barneys-new-york-files-for-bankruptcy\" title=\"\">seek bankruptcy protection.</a></p> <p>The dire financial position at Barneys has emerged as other retail landmarks in the city have already closed their doors. Lord &amp; Taylor \u2013 one of the city\u2019s largest department stores, with an entire building on Fifth Avenue \u2013 recently closed down; its space was sold off to WeWork, the office rental company, and Amazon.</p> <p>It is worse outside Manhattan. Over the next five years, one in every four malls in the US is projected to close, Credit Suisse says. Already, the square footage of dead malls in the US covers <a href=\"https://www.citylab.com/design/2017/12/the-great-retail-retrofit/548753/\" title=\"\">more land than the city of Boston.</a></p> <p>But given Manhattan\u2019s enviable exposure to tourist dollars, the retail collapse in New York shows that the malaise isn\u2019t limited to out-of-town centres. High-end luxury goods purveyors along the retail corridors of leading cities, including New York\u2019s Madison Avenue, Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, and Chicago\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Mile\u201d, are all suffering.</p> <p>According to recent estimates, certain swaths of Manhattan now have vacancy rates of 25%, when 5% is considered normal. And the carnage is getting worse, with the US forecast to lose 12,000 stores this year \u2013 far above 2018\u2019s record losses of more than 5,800 sites.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"87adc2fb46af2c8f7ce9cc38611f6d6a0d5e6180\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/87adc2fb46af2c8f7ce9cc38611f6d6a0d5e6180/0_0_6215_3729/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barneys storefront\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fashion emporium Barneys has applied for bankruptcy protection.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Spencer Platt/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While Barneys\u2019 management has promised to keep its twin Manhattan stores operating, the company\u2019s financial difficulties \u2013 blamed on rising rents and too few visitors \u2013 comes as city legislators consider measures to staunch store losses.</p> <p>While the city can do little about competition from online retail, New York\u2019s mayor, Bill de Blasio, recently <a href=\"https://www.bizjournals.com/newyork/news/2019/02/11/mayor-wants-a-vacancy-tax-for-empty-storefronts.html\" title=\"\">described empty storefronts</a> as a \u201cgrowing problem in our neighbourhoods\u201d and said he was \u201cvery interested in fighting for a vacancy fee or vacancy tax\u201d to penalise landlords who prefer to keep stores empty while they search for top-dollar rents.</p> <p>The proposal could trigger conflict between city officials and landlords. Many landlords are now hedge funds and institutional investors who may enjoy tax advantages from leaving their properties vacant and who, in any case, prefer to rent to store chains prepared to sign multi-year leases.</p> <p>By imposing a tax on store owners who keep properties vacant, De Blasio said, the city would \u201cencourage landlords to turn their properties over more quickly and ensure that small businesses have an opportunity to rent them at a reasonable level\u201d.</p> <p>But the question of when, or if, the losses will begin to affect New York as a tourist destination is harder to answer. The city drew a record-high 65.2 million visitors in 2018, the ninth straight annual increase. While most of the rise came from domestic visitors, tourists accounted for $44bn (\u00a336bn) in spending. The city\u2019s hotels sold 37.7 million overnight stays that generated more than $620m in taxes.</p> <p>On Madison Avenue last week, many tourists said they had noticed the loss of stores, and while it had yet to affect their enthusiasm to visit the city, it may yet. \u201cNew York is shopping: it\u2019s a very important part of it,\u201d said Dhani Singh, visiting from Norway. If it wasn\u2019t good, she added, \u201cI would think again about it.\u201d</p> <h2>A downturn down under?</h2> <p>After 27 years without a recession, the Australian economy is finally faltering. Growth is weak, wages are stagnant and the country\u2019s once-buoyant housing market has slumped more than 10% in the past 18 months.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, the retail industry has not escaped the pain.

      "bodyText": "There is a lot to do in Manhattan \u2013 but shopping? Maybe not so much these days. Once one of the hottest markets on the planet, New York\u2019s retail sector is suffering. Surveying the empty storefronts on Fifth Avenue, holidaymaker Gill Stewart, from Stokesley in Yorkshire, said she was surprised by the number of vacancies. \u201cWe\u2019ve come across a few places that are empty or under refurbishment, certainly many more than we expected,\u201d she said. As the family wondered which direction to go in, Stewart noted that her teenage children, Nathan and Eleanor, weren\u2019t even clamouring to visit the shops. Her daughter confirmed that the focus of their New York experience was shifting. \u201cIn the past, we\u2019ve bought things without the intention of shopping,\u201d Eleanor said. \u201cOn this trip we haven\u2019t unexpectedly got anything.\u201d Attitudes like that should give New York\u2019s retailers and legislators pause for thought. The city is by far the largest tourist destination in the US, and whether that is for sightseeing or shopping, the decline of the Manhattan consumer experience could limit the city\u2019s appeal. On Fifth Avenue, Vince Wang and his family, visiting from Shanghai, said China had also been hit by a retail downturn, but it was a surprise to find the same trend in Manhattan. \u201cChinese who shop for luxury goods often do so in the US or Europe, but compared to 10 years ago a lot of shops have disappeared,\u201d he said. The striking deterioration of some of Manhattan\u2019s most popular shopping districts was underscored by the decision on Monday by Barneys, the city\u2019s famous fashion emporium, to seek bankruptcy protection. The dire financial position at Barneys has emerged as other retail landmarks in the city have already closed their doors. Lord &amp; Taylor \u2013 one of the city\u2019s largest department stores, with an entire building on Fifth Avenue \u2013 recently closed down; its space was sold off to WeWork, the office rental company, and Amazon. It is worse outside Manhattan. Over the next five years, one in every four malls in the US is projected to close, Credit Suisse says. Already, the square footage of dead malls in the US covers more land than the city of Boston. But given Manhattan\u2019s enviable exposure to tourist dollars, the retail collapse in New York shows that the malaise isn\u2019t limited to out-of-town centres. High-end luxury goods purveyors along the retail corridors of leading cities, including New York\u2019s Madison Avenue, Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, and Chicago\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Mile\u201d, are all suffering. According to recent estimates, certain swaths of Manhattan now have vacancy rates of 25%, when 5% is considered normal. And the carnage is getting worse, with the US forecast to lose 12,000 stores this year \u2013 far above 2018\u2019s record losses of more than 5,800 sites. While Barneys\u2019 management has promised to keep its twin Manhattan stores operating, the company\u2019s financial difficulties \u2013 blamed on rising rents and too few visitors \u2013 comes as city legislators consider measures to staunch store losses. While the city can do little about competition from online retail, New York\u2019s mayor, Bill de Blasio, recently described empty storefronts as a \u201cgrowing problem in our neighbourhoods\u201d and said he was \u201cvery interested in fighting for a vacancy fee or vacancy tax\u201d to penalise landlords who prefer to keep stores empty while they search for top-dollar rents. The proposal could trigger conflict between city officials and landlords. Many landlords are now hedge funds and institutional investors who may enjoy tax advantages from leaving their properties vacant and who, in any case, prefer to rent to store chains prepared to sign multi-year leases. By imposing a tax on store owners who keep properties vacant, De Blasio said, the city would \u201cencourage landlords to turn their properties over more quickly and ensure that small businesses have an opportunity to rent them at a reasonable level\u201d. But the question of when, or if, the losses will begin to affect New York as a tourist destination is harder to answer. The city drew a record-high 65.2 million visitors in 2018, the ninth straight annual increase. While most of the rise came from domestic visitors, tourists accounted for $44bn (\u00a336bn) in spending. The city\u2019s hotels sold 37.7 million overnight stays that generated more than $620m in taxes. On Madison Avenue last week, many tourists said they had noticed the loss of stores, and while it had yet to affect their enthusiasm to visit the city, it may yet. \u201cNew York is shopping: it\u2019s a very important part of it,\u201d said Dhani Singh, visiting from Norway. If it wasn\u2019t good, she added, \u201cI would think again about it.\u201d A downturn down under? After 27 years without a recession, the Australian economy is finally faltering. Growth is weak, wages are stagnant and the country\u2019s once-buoyant housing market has slumped more than 10% in the past 18 months. Not surprisingly, the retail industry has not escaped the pain. The country\u2019s venerable department store chain David Jones \u2013 the antipodean equivalent of John Lewis \u2013 has declared the retail sector in recession and the 48-branch group is now worth less than half the A$2.2bn (\u00a31.2bn) the South African company Woolworths paid for it in 2014. David Jones\u2019s long-time rival Myer is also under a cloud and is closing stores and boosting its online operation. The current reporting season could well throw up more nasty surprises. Analysts expect such stalwarts of the country\u2019s myriad shopping malls as Harvey Norman and JB Hi-Fi to deliver poor figures in the coming days. Part of the reason for the downturn is basic economics. \u201cAustralian consumers are mortgaged to the hilt,\u201d says Eleanor Creagh, a market strategist at Saxo Capital Markets in Sydney. \u201cHousehold debt is incredibly high, the savings rate is low and it\u2019s only so long that consumers can whittle away at their savings as they watch their biggest asset, their house, decline in value.\u201d But it is not just slowing growth that is behind the downturn: the twin spectres of international competition and online shopping are beginning to haunt Australia in the same way as they do in the UK and the US. Discount stores such as Target, Kmart and Big W, for decades the go-to destinations for cheap household goods, toys and clothes, are all feeling the heat, which has increased since Amazon started trading down under at the start of the year. Big W, owned by Woolworths, has been especially badly hit and is closing 30 of its 180 outlets. The ever-cut-throat world of fashion retailing is no different. Long-established fashion chains such as Roger David, Ed Harry and Pumpkin Patch have fallen by the wayside amid the arrival of international fast-fashion brands such as Zara, Uniqlo and H&amp;M.

But this movie will show how important and beautiful integration and immigration can be \u2026 We believe that the message which this movie gives is very important, more important than 10 or 20 years ago.\u201d The film is the first English-language movie for the film\u2019s Colombian director, Ciro Guerra and the screenplay is by Coetzee. When his novel was published in 1980, critics described it as a \u201cmasterwork\u201d, a parable about the use of mythical enemies for social control. In a story set in an imaginary empire populated by barbarian tribes, Rylance plays The Magistrate, \u201ca responsible official\u201d, who begins to question imperialism. Iervolino described by Variety magazine as one of the industry\u2019s most powerful independent producers, is investing hundreds of millions of dollars in major movies, said the actor deserved an Oscar for his performance. \u201cHe plays someone who realises that the government was trying to scare the population by saying that \u2018the barbarians are coming, bad people are coming, the invasion is coming\u2019. Actually, the government was only instilling fear.\u201d Depp portrays a heartless bureaucrat despatched by the Empire\u2019s secret service amid claims that the barbarians are preparing to mutiny.",

      "bodyText": "Wealthy financier Jeffrey Epstein, whose apparent suicide in jail has stunned the US, courted many rich, powerful and famous people over his lifetime as a mover and shaker on the party circuits of New York and Florida Many of them distanced themselves from him in the wake of his recent arrest on charges of sex trafficking, but they included politicians, socialites, royals and top business figures. Donald Trump Donald Trump has called Epstein a \u201cterrific guy\u201d and \u201ca lot of fun to be with\u201d. Epstein paid two visits to the president\u2019s Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida, in 1997 and 2000, posing for photos with Trump on both occasions. Epstein\u2019s personal address book, leaked in 2009, contained 14 phone numbers for Trump and members of his staff, according to reports. Bill Clinton Bill Clinton has praised Epstein for his intellect and charitable work in magazine interviews. Flight logs have revealed the former US president took trips on Epstein\u2019s private plane, reportedly nicknamed the \u201cLolita Express\u201d. Clinton has denied any close relationship with Epstein, instead linking their contact to aid work in the developing world. Prince Andrew A longtime friend of Epstein, their relationship dated back to the early 1990s. The pair were reportedly seen partying together in St Tropez and Thailand. Buckingham Palace has issued outright denials of all allegations against the Duke of York for any improper behavior. Alan Dershowitz The Harvard Law professor emeritus, famous for defending celebrity clients such as OJ Simpson, has also been linked to Epstein. Alan Dershowitz was reportedly identified as participating in Epstein\u2019s sex ring by at least two of the women engaged in a 2007 case against Epstein, allegations he has dismissed as \u201cunequivocally and completely false\u201d. Ghislaine Maxwell Ghislaine Maxwell, the daughter of the late press baron Robert Maxwell, has never denied her friendship with Epstein. In documents filed by Virginia Giuffre\u2019s lawyers, one accuser claimed in a deposition that Maxwell \u201crecruited her under the guise of a legitimate assistant position, but asked her to perform sexual massages for Epstein\u201d. Leslie Wexner The billionaire behind the Victoria\u2019s Secret lingerie chain hired Epstein in 1991 to manage his money, giving him vast power over his investment and tax affairs. Epstein reportedly made more than $200m from the deal. But last week Leslie Wexner said the financier had \u201cmisappropriated\u201d more than $46m of his personal fortune. \u201cI am embarrassed that, like so many others, I was deceived by Mr Epstein,\u201d he said in a letter to the Wexner Foundation trustees. \u201cI know now that my trust in him was grossly misplaced and I deeply regret having ever crossed his path.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Hong Kong has been gripped by another night of violence after a peaceful afternoon march in Tai Po splintered into several fronts as protesters attempted to outrun the police. Riot police fired teargas at crowds in the neighbouring districts of Shatin and Tai Wai on Saturday night in an attempt to disperse black-clad protesters who had barricaded roads with nearby supplies. Several kilometres away, riot police also used teargas on crowds in the tourist district of Tsim Sha Tsui, while across the city at Hong Kong International airport a peaceful sit-in continued into its second day. The majority of protesters, however, appeared to be mobile on Saturday night, with thousands dispersing across the New Territories and Kowloon after receiving reports of police movements on messaging apps. \u201cThe strategy is, when the police come we will leave and change to a different place,\u201d said Michael Wong, a nursing student and volunteer medic. \u201cWhen the police come to a different place they need to plan and have a reaction time, so we use [it] to just buy time.\u201d The cat and mouse game, often referred to by the slogan \u201cbe water\u201d, has made recent protests less predictable than at the beginning of June when anti-government demonstrations began against a legislative bill that many feared was an attack on Hong Kong\u2019s civil and political rights. \u201cEveryone is the frontline. You can decide what you are going to do,\u201d said one protester who asked to not be named for fear of repercussions. \u201c[Some] are going to Shatin or the airport, but you can decide what to do.\u201d As protests enter their 10th week, Hong Kong appears to be facing its worst political crisis since its return to Chinese rule in 1997 as the government fails to respond to intense public anger at the legislative bill and heavy-handed police tactics. Protests have become an almost daily occurrence across the city, with large-scale demonstrations reserved for the weekend. Much of the anger sustaining the protests appears to come from longstanding fears about the future of Hong Kong under Chinese rule, and the government\u2019s inability to understand or act on the desires of many of its residents after the failure of 2014\u2019s democracy protests. Over the past five years, the government appears to have moved increasingly closer to Beijing although Hong Kong was promised semi-autonomy until 2047. One protester, Alice Chan, said she regarded Carrie Lam\u2019s failure as Hong Kong\u2019s leader to respond to protest demands, which have remained much the same for 10 weeks, as a sign of Chinese interference. Lam has not withdrawn the legislative bill, which would have allowed for criminal suspects to be deported to stand trial in mainland Chinese courts, although she has pledged it is suspended. \u201cI think they just want to hear and do what the Beijing government wants them to do,\u201d Chan said. \u201cIt\u2019s not what Hong Kong people want them to do. It\u2019s the difference since the umbrella revolution.\u201d Mistrust in the Hong Kong government and its autonomy, which is protected by the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d agreement, has led to many protesters calling for direct elections for the first time since 2014.",

The US chemist was finishing off a project in which he and a colleague, Sam Ruben, had bombarded a piece of graphite with subatomic particles. The aim of their work was to create new forms of carbon, ones that might have practical uses.</p> \n<p>Exhausted, Kamen staggered out of his laboratory at Berkeley in California, having finished off the project in the early hours of 27 February 1940. He desperately needed a break. Rumpled, red eyed and with a three-day growth of beard, he looked a mess.</p> \n<p>And that was unfortunate. Berkeley police were then searching for an escaped convict who had just committed several murders. So when they saw the unkempt Kamen they promptly picked him up, bundled him into the back of their patrol car and interrogated him as a suspected killer.</p> \n<p>Thus one of most revolutionary pieces of research undertaken in the past century was nearly terminated at birth when one of its lead scientists was accused of murder. It was only when witnesses made it clear that Kamen was not the man the police were after that he was released and allowed to go back to the University of California Radiation Laboratory to look at the lump of graphite that he and Ruben had been irradiating.</p> \n<p>It did not take the pair long to realise they had produced a substance with remarkable properties, one that has since transformed a host of different scientific fields and continues to help scientists make major discoveries. By irradiating graphite, they had created carbon-14.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf6e294b3d52e07e75a91444ec06f425b962f525\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf6e294b3d52e07e75a91444ec06f425b962f525/0_162_1600_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"martin kamen in a science lab in 1939\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Martin Kamen in 1939.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: US National Archives Public Domain Archive</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThat gloomy night and morning of 27 February 1940 began a revolution in physiology, biochemistry, archaeology, geology, biomedicine, oceanography, palaeoclimatology and anthropology as well as nuclear chemistry,\u201d says environment researcher John Marra, author of the newly published <em><a href=\"https://cup.columbia.edu/book/hot-carbon/9780231186704\" title=\"\">Hot Carbon: Carbon-14 and a </a></em><em><a href=\"https://cup.columbia.edu/book/hot-carbon/9780231186704\" title=\"\">Revolution in </a></em><em><a href=\"https://cup.columbia.edu/book/hot-carbon/9780231186704\" title=\"\">Science</a></em>. \u201cCarbon-14, perhaps the most important isotope to life on Earth, was \u2018born\u2019.\u201d</p> \n<p>Carbon-14 has six protons and eight neutrons in its nucleus. By contrast, most of the carbon in our bodies and in the outside world, known as carbon-12, has six protons and six neutrons.

Cosmic rays batter the upper atmosphere and send cascades of neutrons through the air, they calculated. These neutrons strike atoms of nitrogen, the main component of Earth\u2019s atmosphere, and transform some into atoms of carbon-14.

A chemist who had worked on the Manhattan Project to build the first atom bomb, Libby realised that when an organism dies, it will stop absorbing carbon, including carbon-14, and its existing store of the latter will slowly decay. So, by measuring the radioactivity of a sample taken from the organism, its carbon-14 content could be estimated and the date of its time of death could be measured. The sciences of archaeology and palaeontology were about to be revolutionised.</p> \n<p>A major problem had to be overcome, however. Carbon-14 exists in only very low levels in the tissue of recently deceased animals and plants: about one in a trillion of their carbon atoms are carbon-14.

How could researchers separate carbon-14\u2019s weak signal from this overwhelming background noise?</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>We have gained substantial understanding of the natural world because of carbon-14</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>John Marra</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Libby solved the problem by carefully shielding his detectors and developing ways to tune out any radiation that made it through to the walls of his device. Then he turned to the gas methane, which contains carbon, to provide final validation of his technique, comparing samples from two very different sources. One sample was extracted from natural gas, a fossil fuel whose carbon-14 should have decayed long ago. The second came from the city of Baltimore sewerage system and was extracted from human excrement. It should be rich in carbon-14, having just been produced by humans, Libby reasoned.</p> \n<p>And that is exactly what he found. Ancient methane had no carbon-14. By contrast, methane newly excreted by humans was relatively rich in the isotope. As Marra says: \u201cHuman waste from sewer lines sent science onward.\u201d</p> \n<p>Libby then provided final proof of his dating technology by measuring the radioactivity \u2013 and, by inference, the age \u2013 of a series of organic samples of known antiquity: wood from the Egyptian funeral ship of Sesostris III, linen that had wrapped a Dead Sea scroll and a bread roll that had been \u201ccooked\u201d in the volcanic eruption that buried Pompeii. His results perfectly matched the known dates of the items he had scanned.</p> \n<p>It was a brilliant undertaking for which Libby was awarded the Nobel prize for chemistry in 1960, though he was lucky in one sense. Libby assumed that the rate of carbon-14 production in the atmosphere had been constant for the past few tens of thousands of years. In fact, it has varied fairly widely, thanks to changes in sunspot activity, atmospheric nuclear bomb tests and rising emissions of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels. These have to be taken carefully into account when estimating ages, scientists now realise, though the underlying basis of radiocarbon dating remains sound.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"555b41bace049e3a0bc2ab660f8822b5f27c3f06\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/555b41bace049e3a0bc2ab660f8822b5f27c3f06/0_0_3753_2644/1000.jpg\" alt=\"willard libby is given the nobel prize in chemistry in december 1960\" width=\"1000\" height=\"705\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Willard Libby is given the Nobel prize in chemistry, December 1960.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bettmann Archive</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>More recently, radiocarbon dating has changed from simply measuring the radioactivity emitted by carbon-14 nuclei to directly counting numbers of atoms of the isotope in a sample.

      "bodyText": "Martin Kamen had worked for three days and three nights without sleep. The US chemist was finishing off a project in which he and a colleague, Sam Ruben, had bombarded a piece of graphite with subatomic particles. The aim of their work was to create new forms of carbon, ones that might have practical uses. Exhausted, Kamen staggered out of his laboratory at Berkeley in California, having finished off the project in the early hours of 27 February 1940. He desperately needed a break. Rumpled, red eyed and with a three-day growth of beard, he looked a mess. And that was unfortunate. Berkeley police were then searching for an escaped convict who had just committed several murders. So when they saw the unkempt Kamen they promptly picked him up, bundled him into the back of their patrol car and interrogated him as a suspected killer. Thus one of most revolutionary pieces of research undertaken in the past century was nearly terminated at birth when one of its lead scientists was accused of murder. It was only when witnesses made it clear that Kamen was not the man the police were after that he was released and allowed to go back to the University of California Radiation Laboratory to look at the lump of graphite that he and Ruben had been irradiating. It did not take the pair long to realise they had produced a substance with remarkable properties, one that has since transformed a host of different scientific fields and continues to help scientists make major discoveries. By irradiating graphite, they had created carbon-14. \u201cThat gloomy night and morning of 27 February 1940 began a revolution in physiology, biochemistry, archaeology, geology, biomedicine, oceanography, palaeoclimatology and anthropology as well as nuclear chemistry,\u201d says environment researcher John Marra, author of the newly published Hot Carbon: Carbon-14 and a Revolution in Science. \u201cCarbon-14, perhaps the most important isotope to life on Earth, was \u2018born\u2019.\u201d Carbon-14 has six protons and eight neutrons in its nucleus. By contrast, most of the carbon in our bodies and in the outside world, known as carbon-12, has six protons and six neutrons. Crucially, those two extra neutrons make the nucleus of a carbon-14 atom unstable so that it decays radioactively into an atom of nitrogen. More importantly, these decays are relatively infrequent so that it is possible to measure changes in a carbon sample over tens of thousands of years. (See box below.) \u201cCarbon is what we are made of,\u201d says Marra, who is professor of earth and environmental sciences at Brooklyn College, New York. \u201cCarbon is life.

      "bodyText": "At the end of May, as Papua New Guinea\u2019s most recent political crisis came to a head, huge numbers of people across the country tuned in to watch Peter O\u2019Neill resign as prime minister and the parliament elect a new leader. Many were watching an online livestream and as the parliamentary debate continued questions from viewers began rolling in, many of them along the same theme: \u201cWhere is BK?\u201d BK, as Bryan Kramer is sometimes known, has become a star of PNG politics, despite being just a first-term MP for the electorate of Madang, on the north-east coast of the country. He is an anti-corruption campaigner who was instrumental in bringing to light the UBS scandal that helped to bring down O\u2019Neill\u2019s leadership, and was a key leader in the opposition movement, pushing for O\u2019Neill\u2019s removal. The new prime minister, James Marape, has since appointed him police minister, and Kramer is determined to clean up PNG \u2013 which ranks 138th out of 175 countries in the Corruption Perception Index \u2013 using a combination of hard work and tech strategies including reporting crime via Facebook. But it is a role that comes with risks. Kramer wrote on Facebook in July that when he was appointed to the role, Marape warned him the job could pose a danger to his safety and warned him to take precautions. \u201cMy response was, God will decide when it is time for me to leave this earth and if it happens in my cause to fight corruption then so be it,\u201d wrote Kramer. \u201cI have no question of doubt I will eventually get killed for what I do. It goes without saying when you get in the way of those stealing billions in public funds, they will do whatever it takes to get rid of you.\u201d Does he really fear something will happen to him? \u201cMore than definitely,\u201d he tells the Guardian on his recent visit to Sydney as part of Marape\u2019s delegation. \u201cBut that\u2019s life.\u201d From outsider to inner circle Kramer says he was not present on that crucial day in parliament when Marape won the vote in protest at the way the change of leadership happened. \u201cIt was my objective since coming ... into office, to dislodge the former prime minister and go after the system of corruption in PNG,\u201d he says. So when \u2013 in his telling of things \u2013 the opposition leader Patrick Pruaitch ran \u201ca back channel with O\u2019Neill\u201d and then Marape \u201cdid a deal at two o\u2019clock in the morning with the faction of the O\u2019Neill camp\u201d , he decided to sit out the vote in protest. \u201cI couldn\u2019t support either faction.\u201d Despite his very noticeable absence from the chamber, Marape still appointed him to the cabinet. The Papua New Guinean political outsider suddenly found himself on the inside. Before Marape was elected leader, Kramer said that investigating former prime minister Peter O\u2019Neill was among the opposition\u2019s top priorities and Kramer is still determined to pursue the former PM. \u201cHe won\u2019t finish his term,\u201d says Kramer. \u201cHe will be arrested and prosecuted.\u201d You think so? I ask. \u201cI intend to do it so,\u201d he says with a laugh. Predictably, his work has left him with enemies. In 2014, Kramer was arrested for attempted murder in a case he says was a political stitch-up (the charges were later dropped), a senior police officer recently issued a search warrant for Kramer related to a charge of cyber-bullying, something Kramer says \u201cis being dealt with through administrative process\u201d. Kramer does acknowledge his social media posts occasionally land him in hot water. For example during the leadership turmoil, an opposition MP used the excuse of needing to go to church as a reason to leave the hotel where opposition MPs were holed up, but then joined the government camp. Kramer posted news of this defection alongside a picture of Judas and called for the MP\u2019s church to shame him for his betrayal. Kramer chuckles at the memory: \u201cI got told that member almost passed out in shock.\u201d Kramer\u2019s work as police minister is well and truly cut out for him. Less than two months into the job, PNG suffered one of its most horrific acts of violence in years, when over the course of a few days 23 people were murdered as part of ongoing tribal fighting in Hela province. Kramer went straight up to Karida village, where 16 women and children were killed in an early-morning massacre. \u201cWhen these kinds of incidents happen, what happens is there\u2019s a sense of fear right throughout the community and then people will flee and no one knows what\u2019s going on, if there will be retaliations,\u201d he says. Kramer arrived in the village just after the bodies had been buried. \u201cOver the years you just become accustomed [to witnessing this sort of violence],\u201d he says. \u201cObviously it\u2019s graphic when you turn up to a scene and you see the effects of someone who has been chopped by a machete.\u201d Indeed, it was witnessing violence in his home of Madang that prompted Kramer to get involved in politics in the first place. \u201cI\u2019ve spent considerable amount of time in the communities, running an NGO \u2026 working as a police reservist, seeing first-hand the effects of sexual violence, vicious crimes,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd over time you realise that the real problems aren\u2019t caused at the community level, they\u2019re caused at the political level, so I took an interest in politics.\u201d \u201cThe biggest challenge in PNG is, because of the corruption, our institutions have been collapsing, therefore once they collapsed, law and order breaks down and you get a viciousness in the community.\u201d Reporting crime via Facebook the \u2018fastest way\u2019 As to what to do about it, he has a few ideas.

They\u2019ve gone back with the spoils every time, always enjoying themselves immensely in the process: 0-5, 0-4, 1-4, 0-4. Throw in three wins at the Etihad, and City are on a seven-game winning streak against the Hammers.</p> <p><strong>Factor this in too: Pep Guardiola\u2019s treble-winning champions are effectively on a 14-match winning streak in the Premier League. </strong>For that is how they finished off last season, how they finished off Liverpool. They\u2019re not half bad, this lot. West Ham - who have lost an unprecedented 12 opening-day fixtures in the Premier League era - have their work cut out today.</p> <p><strong>But if City are allowed to carry over their 14-match winning streak from last season, then West Ham must be allowed their three-win sequence at the end of the previous campaign too. </strong>And that\u2019s not the only reason for optimism in the east end. Having finished comfortably tenth in 2018-19, Manuel Pellegrini has made some significant summer upgrades, including \u00a345m record signing Sebastien Haller and former Villarreal midfielder Pablo Fornals. Both are expected to make their debuts today. Jack Wilshere is fit! And losing streaks are there to be snapped. So, y\u2019know.</p> <p><strong>The wind is forecast to be up, though bookies have the champs as strong favourites to breeze through anyway. </strong>Will the conditions be a leveller? Will the hosts cause a shock and hit the ground running? Or will City chalk up the first three points of yet another huge title-winning haul? We\u2019ll find out soon enough. It\u2019s the Premier League! It\u2019s back! It\u2019s on!</p> <p><strong>Kick off: </strong>12.30pm BST.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-10T10:24:58.144Z\">at 11.24am BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "No word from Manuel Pellegrini, who is presumably seething right now. It was a miserable afternoon for his new-look West Ham, but then they were playing the relentless champions, who have now won 15 Premier League games in a row. They are always magical as a collective, though today Raheem Sterling shone brightest. A superb hat-trick. West Ham go away to lick their wounds, while City will already be thinking about joining Huddersfield Town, Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United as three-in-a-row title winners. Thanks for reading! Pep\u2019s verdict! \u201cIt was a typical first day of the season. Heavy and hot. In the first half, we had to improve, but that\u2019s normal. What\u2019s important is taking the three points. It is an incredible result, but we know we have to improve. We have many things to improve. We have lost a bit with VAR [in having to wait to see whether you can celebrate a goal]. We have to control our emotions and be strong, positive or negative. It is part of the game.\u201d On BT Sport, former referee Peter Walton gives his verdict on VAR. \u201cIt\u2019s been a good day for VAR, it\u2019s been a good day for the Premier League in its adverts. The software is top-end stuff, it\u2019s so accurate it\u2019s unbelievable. It\u2019s all mathematically assumed. I think by the end of this season, fans and media will accept that a player is a millimetre offside with the technology that we\u2019ve got.\u201d Good luck with getting everyone 100 percent onside with that. The blithe confidence of it! These people know the price of everything and the value of nothing. Hat-trick hero Sterling speaks! \u201cThe most important thing was three points, to start well. At times we were a bit sloppy in the first half, but once the second goal went in, I thought the lads were brilliant. It was difficult in the firest half to get the cobewbs off. The breathing was heavy and some of the touches were sloppy. But once the second goal went in, we could find our passes. We were smoother and a lot more chances came. I am trying to improve my finishing. There are competitions in training, and it\u2019s just a joy to put the ball in the back of the net!\u201d As for VAR? \u201cIt\u2019s a bit difficult during the game, because you want your goal to stand. But at the end of the day, so long as the decisions are right, that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d The man\u2019s a born diplomat. The champions are quite magnificent. Raheem Sterling is brilliant. West Ham are still a work in progress. VAR can do one. 90 min +4: West Ham waste the free kick. It\u2019s been a miserable afternoon for the hosts, with Ederson barely breaking sweat. One magnificent double save apart, of course. 90 min +3: After VAR checks the obviously legit goal is good - FOR THE LOVE OF GOD - the game restarts and Sterling is booked for a slide on Snodgrass. Mahrez drops deep and slides a pass down the inside-right channel to release Sterling. Fabianski comes out and commits himself, allowing Sterling to slot neatly into the bottom right for an opening-day hat-trick! 90 min: There will be five added minutes. Not yet sure whether this number has been checked, cleared, and processed in triplicate by the VAR man. 89 min: Practical Solutions to VAR Nonsense (pt II): \u201cHow about a rule that gives something like half a metre leeway which would account for longer arms, bigger quiffs, etc.?\u201d wonders Colin Young. 88 min: Practical Solutions to VAR Nonsense (pt I): \u201cSterling should have taped his sleeve down to stop it flapping into an offside position,\u201d suggests Denise Robinson. 87 min: Walker is booked for a late clank on Fornals. The crowd cheer in the sarcastic fashion. Aguero gets a second chance, and doesn\u2019t make the same mistake twice. He slots this one into the bottom left, Fabianski jumping the other way. 84 min: Sterling wants to take it. But Aguero gets his way. And he misses it. A dreadful effort, straight at Fabianski, who parries clear. But ... it\u2019s going to be taken again, because Fabianski had jumped forward, while Rice had encroached before Aguero took the kick. Good old VAR. Eh? 83 min: Mahrez drops a shoulder and slips into the area from the right. Doip hangs out a leg, and after a bit of thought the ref points to the spot. Correctly. No need for VAR. 81 min: Corner for West Ham. Ederson snaffles Snodgrass\u2019s delivery. 79 min: Gundogan and Foden come on for De Bruyne and Silva. De Bruyne takes receipt of one of Pep\u2019s patented theatrical tactical bollockings. All very animated. 77 min: Naturally, the VAR goons have to stick their nebs in. For a brief second, it looks like Sterling was half an inch offside, but they zoom in and it turns out Balbuena had a hangnail that was playing him on. So the goal stands. Mahrez cuts in from the right and dinks a ball down the channel for Sterling, who loops it over the outrushing Fabianski and into the net. Such an exquisite finish! 73 min: A sensational double save by Ederson! Hernandez meets a cross from the right, sticking out a thigh and sending the ball goalwards from six yards. Ederson parries. The ball loops to Lanzini, who guides a header towards the bottom left. It\u2019s going in, but Ederson sticks out an arm to turn it away. What a stop (x2)! 72 min: Ederson releases Mahrez clear on the right. The flag goes up for offside. Another very close one. 71 min: Fornals threads a pass down the right for Fredericks. The resulting low cross is cleared easily enough. This is a little better from West Ham, though Ederson still hasn\u2019t had a great deal to do. 70 min: Lanzini dribbles down the left and stands one up to the far post. Zinchenko heads clear under pressure from Haller, who has had a quiet debut. 68 min: Aguero replaces Jesus. \u201cSad to say, but this will be just one of 10 million emails you\u2019ll get on VAR,\u201d predicts Hubert O\u2019Hearn. \u201cYeah, the Sterling non-goal is exactly what I feared \u2013 technically correct, but miles away from the spirit of the rules of the game. Offside is to prevent cherry picking, not whether a winger wears a size 11 boot (onside!) or 11 \u00bd (Oooooo ... just offside). VAR \u2013 or whatever the term is in cricket \u2013 works great there. Football ... not so much. May God save us all from \u2018improvements\u2019.\u201d Preach on, brother. 66 min: Exit Anderson, with a limp. Hernandez comes on in his stead. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to stop posting GOAL! and instead post GOAL?,\u201d writes JR in Illinois, presumably typing with a heavy heart and a sigh. \u201cIf only Raheem Sterling had shaved his armpit hair this morning! But seriously, VAR is absolutely brutal.\u201d 64 min: Anderson is down clutching his thigh. It doesn\u2019t look as though he\u2019s in the mood to continue. 62 min: Like London buses ... Anderson is shown a yellow card for coming in late on Laporte. 61 min: Balbuena is booked for sliding in on Jesus. 60 min: Snodgrass whips into the centre. Ederson comes out and flaps. Diop heads over the bar, with the goal unguarded. West Ham so close to getting back into the game! 59 min: Cresswell is brought down by Mahrez, near the corner flag on the left. A free kick in a dangerous position. 57 min: Snodgrass is on for Wilshere, who last completed 90 minutes in 1968. This is preposterous. Sterling\u2019s shoulder was about one millimetre offside as he was sent clear by Silva. The goal\u2019s ruled out. Can you hear that hissing sound? That\u2019s the spirit going out of the game. Oh yes, that\u2019s why they\u2019re champions. West Ham are carved apart down the left. Sterling is released down the wing by Zinchenko, then exchanges passes with Silva. Sterling is free in the area, with Jesus in the centre. He rolls the ball across the face of goal. Jesus slots home. This was incredibly simple, but such a good goal. Mahrez wriggles free from a tight spot on the right and slips a pass inside for De Bruyne, who powers down the middle into space. Sterling is clear on the left. De Bruyne finds him with a perfectly weighted pass. Sterling takes a touch and slips the ball past a helpless Fabianski. As the old song goes, that\u2019s why they\u2019re champions. 50 min: Mahrez crosses from the left. Sterling aims a weak header straight at Fabianski. I wonder when West Ham plan to come out for the second half. 49 min: City continue to stroke it about. West Ham have hardly had a touch since the restart. 47 min: Fornals is on for Antonio. City have immediately imposed themselves again. Silva neatly slides Zinchenko into space down the left. Diop does well to slap his low cross clear. We\u2019re off again! City get the ball rolling for the second half. Meanwhile, before any meaningful action occurs, here\u2019s our old friend Mac Millings making reference to an MBM from 2007, for goodness sake. \u201cDearest Scott, I know It\u2019s back! and It\u2019s on!, but, while I\u2019m excitedly nervous about how my hometown Hornets and their record signing, Ismaila Sarr, are going to fare, as far as the top of the table goes, I am decidedly uninspired by a two-horse race that\u2019s really a one-horse race. I\u2019m probably wrong (I usually am) so cheer me up, Scotty, otherwise it\u2019s THE GUARDIAN PATENTED FUNK-O-METER\u00ae: B.\u201d For some reason, the GUARDIAN PATENTED FUNK-O-METER\u00ae seems to have been removed from our image database, so inquisitive young minds, desirous of knowing what Old Mac is yammering on about, will have to click here to find out. While you\u2019re there, please consider that this is the sort of thing you won\u2019t get at The Athletic. Thanks. You\u2019re welcome. Half-time entertainment. A schadenfreude special for City fans. And that\u2019s the end of the first half. West Ham started confidently, but City quickly grew into the game and took the lead thanks to Kyle Walker\u2019s blistering pace and Gabriel Jesus\u2019s cute finish. The hosts will be glad to hear the whistle. Time to regroup and rethink. The champions look in control. 45 min +1: One added minute. And City nearly make it two. Diop snatches at a simple clearance on the edge of the West Ham box. The ball goes straight to Jesus, who should probably hoick it back over Fabianski, in no man\u2019s land, yards from his line. But Jesus hits it straight at the keeper, who is gifted the save. 44 min: Antonio slides Fredericks clear on the overlap, down the right. He hooks a cross into the mixer from the byline, but Haller can\u2019t bring the ball down. City momentarily exposed ... but Ederson still hasn\u2019t had to make a serious save. 43 min: Rodri clatters into the back of Wilshere. He\u2019s really testing the crowd\u2019s patience now. But the referee still isn\u2019t minded to act. 42 min: City ping it around prettily and patiently again. Mesmeric. Then Silva flicks a pass down the left to release Sterling. The flag goes up for offside, which seems a tad incorrect. But that\u2019s the way the lino sees it. 40 min: Rodri tugs Rice\u2019s shirt as the West Ham midfielder looks to burst into space in the midfield. He should probably be booked for that sly move, but the referee is in a generous mood. 39 min: De Bruyne strides with great purpose down the right. He opens his body to fashion a delicate cross, intended for Sterling in the middle, but Balbuena intercepts and clears. City are wreaking havoc down this flank. 37 min: West Ham having sparked into life again, City ping it around slowly to take the heat out of the match. And then suddenly pounce themselves, De Bruyne exchanging passes with Silva out on the left, cutting into the area and smashing a shot towards the bottom left. Fabianski smothers. 35 min: West Ham have rediscovered their early mojo and are pressing foward again. Antonio flicks into the City box from the right. Haller, with his back to goal, tries to guide a shot over his shoulder and into the top left. There\u2019s no whip on his effort, though, and Ederson claims with ease. 33 min: And now Rodri is down, having taken an accidental whack in the mush from Antonio. It\u2019s all legit, though it doesn\u2019t stop the VAR machine cranking slowly into action and stopping play for a bit. 32 min: Now the West Ham fans want a penalty, as Zinchenko slides in on Lanzini, who was scooting down the right. It\u2019s a fair challenge, though. 31 min: The home crowd have been quiet since City\u2019s opener. But their spirits are raised when Rice puts in a reducer on Zinchenko in the midfield. 30 min: A bit of space for Cresswell down the left. His cross is too deep, though it doesn\u2019t really matter because there was nobody in the box anyway. 29 min: Now it\u2019s Mahrez\u2019s turn to scream down the right. Cresswell is being hung out to dry here, with little help from his team-mates. Mahrez crosses low into a packed box, but Fabianski gathers bravely. 27 min: And now, all of a sudden, the home side look jittery. Walker surges down the right again. Nothing comes of that sortie, but De Bruyne is soon chipping in from the same flank in the hope of supplying either Jesus or Silva. Both are offside. But the champions are suddenly firing on all cylinders. 26 min: That\u2019s taken the wind out of the home crowd\u2019s sail. West Ham were gaining confidence, but City have nipped that in the bud quicksmart. Mahrez slips Walker clear down the right, on the overlap. Walker is really motoring! He reaches the byline, Cresswell totally burned, and hooks towards the near post. Diop lunges in to slide clear for a corner, but can only nick the ball on. Jesus dinks the ball in from close range, as neat and crisp as you like! 22 min: Wilshere has time to send Anderson into acres of space down the right, but plays the ball straight to Zinchenko instead. The home faithful groan. That was a great chance to put his man in on goal. 21 min: Mahrez should score. Sterling robs a dawdling Rice on the edge of the West Ham box. He slips the ball to De Bruyne, who dinks a pass down the inside right for Mahrez. The winger drops a shoulder and sends Cresswell off to the wrong fire. He\u2019s one on one with Fabianski, but drags his shot into the side netting. 20 min: But then Fabianski hasn\u2019t had much to do yet either. Walker bombs down the right but his cross inside, intended for Jesus, is easily mopped up by the West Ham keeper. 18 min: Haller is sent scampering down the left. City are light at the back, but instead of driving at Walker, the new striker lays off to Lanzini, who immediately falls over. West Ham look reasonably dangerous when they power forward, though they\u2019ve not forced Ederson into any sort of meaningful action yet. 17 min: Sterling is upended by Fredericks just to the left of the West Ham area. A dangerous position to be giving up a free kick. But Silva wastes it, attempting to play Sterling into the box with a quickly slipped pass down the inside left. Sterling doesn\u2019t read it, and Fabianski gathers, much to the crowd\u2019s amusement. 15 min: Mahrez probes down the right, then passes to Silva, who slaps a fierce low shot inches wide of the right-hand post. City have been strangely lax so far, but there\u2019s an example of how quickly they are capable of turning such a situation round. So close to the opening goal. 14 min: Now it\u2019s De Bruyne\u2019s turn to give up possession near his own goal. Antonio is gifted an opportunity to cross from the right, but he wastes it, hooking high over everyone in the centre. 12 min: Anderson has a look down the right, but Rodri doesn\u2019t give up the chase. West Ham are in an adventurous mood. It doesn\u2019t look as though there\u2019s to be any bus parking, despite the obvious threat City carry. 10 min: Nothing happens at the set piece. But it\u2019s been a bright, lively game so far. 9 min: It\u2019s Walker again, though this time in much more positive fashion. He glides down the right and lays off to Mahrez, who cuts inside, then shoots low and hard towards the bottom left. Fabianski extends an arm to save well and concede a corner. 7 min: Walker again sheds the ball needlessly. Lanzini scampers down the inside-left channel, and goes over in the box as Rodri comes across, shoulder to shoulder. Lanzini claims for a penalty as he goes down, but the referee - as well as whoever\u2019s on the VAR - isn\u2019t interested. Quite rightly so. 5 min: West Ham stroke it around for a while. They make little progress upfield, but that\u2019s not really the point. Everyone\u2019s had a touch, and City are uncharacteristically ponderous in these opening exchanges. 3 min: City get a feel of the ball for the first time, but soon Walker cheaply gives up possession. Anderson gets the better of Laporte down the right, but his cutback is met in the clumsy fashion by Wilshere, whose heavy touch gets City - and Walker - off the hook. A slow start for the champions. 2 min: But it comes to nothing. Cresswell is down, having taken a whack in the mouth, Walker holding out an arm. All accidental. The Hammers defender is up again soon enough. And we\u2019re off! Here\u2019s hoping there\u2019s no need for the old VAR, which makes its Premier League debut this week. Balls to it! West Ham get the ball rolling, and there are indeed plenty of pretty bubbles in the air. A huge roar as the hosts press immediately down the left wing. Walker is forced to hack out near the corner flag. A throw deep in City territory. The teams are out! And about! West Ham sport claret shirts with cute 70s-throwback blue panel. Manchester City are sadly not wearing the extremely pretty 70s-throwback shirts paraded at the Community Shield; instead it\u2019s second-choice black for them. It\u2019s a cracking opening-day atmosphere at the London Stadium; Bubbles flying so high, they reach the sky. We\u2019ll be off in two shakes of a lamb\u2019s tail! In the meantime, here\u2019s the first dissenting email of the new season, from Alistair Drummond: \u201cI would assert it\u2019s no longer necessary to state Mike Dean is from the Wirral given his widely-publicised celebrations for Tranmere last season.\u201d Manuel Pellegrini speaks! \u201cIt\u2019s a new season. All the teams are stronger. But I am confident we have a good squad, and I hope we are more consistent. We have a lot of new signings and players who couldn\u2019t play for us last season because of injury. I hope with Sebastien Haller\u2019s quality and with our technical midfield he will be a successful player here.\u201d The first Pep talk of the new season: \u201cWe have seen this much together, the guys always try to do their best. Manuel Pellegrini is an experienced manager, his teams always play in the proper style. First games of the season are always tricky, especially when you play away. But it is what it is. We will try to focus, and improve from here.\u201d Sebastien Haller, West Ham\u2019s \u00a345m record signing makes his debut ... but never mind that! Jack Wilshere starts his first game in 11 months. Jack Wilshere! As for the champions ... Sergio Aguero and Bernardo Silva are on the bench. Gabriel Jesus and new boy Rodri go at it from kick-off. West Ham United: Fabianski, Fredericks, Diop, Balbuena, Cresswell, Wilshere, Rice, Antonio, Lanzini, Felipe Anderson, Haller. Subs: Zabaleta, Hernandez, Snodgrass, Roberto, Sanchez, Fornals, Ogbonna. Manchester City: Ederson, Walker, Stones, Laporte, Zinchenko, De Bruyne, Rodri, Silva, Mahrez, Gabriel Jesus, Sterling. Subs: Bravo, Gundogan, Aguero, Bernardo Silva, Joao Cancelo, Otamendi, Foden. Referee: Mike Dean (Wirral). Manchester City don\u2019t half love the London Stadium. Since West Ham United moved into their new gaff back in 2016, City have paid a visit on four occasions. They\u2019ve gone back with the spoils every time, always enjoying themselves immensely in the process: 0-5, 0-4, 1-4, 0-4. Throw in three wins at the Etihad, and City are on a seven-game winning streak against the Hammers. Factor this in too: Pep Guardiola\u2019s treble-winning champions are effectively on a 14-match winning streak in the Premier League. For that is how they finished off last season, how they finished off Liverpool. They\u2019re not half bad, this lot. West Ham - who have lost an unprecedented 12 opening-day fixtures in the Premier League era - have their work cut out today. But if City are allowed to carry over their 14-match winning streak from last season, then West Ham must be allowed their three-win sequence at the end of the previous campaign too. And that\u2019s not the only reason for optimism in the east end. Having finished comfortably tenth in 2018-19, Manuel Pellegrini has made some significant summer upgrades, including \u00a345m record signing Sebastien Haller and former Villarreal midfielder Pablo Fornals. Both are expected to make their debuts today. Jack Wilshere is fit! And losing streaks are there to be snapped. So, y\u2019know. The wind is forecast to be up, though bookies have the champs as strong favourites to breeze through anyway. Will the conditions be a leveller? Will the hosts cause a shock and hit the ground running? Or will City chalk up the first three points of yet another huge title-winning haul? We\u2019ll find out soon enough. It\u2019s the Premier League! It\u2019s back! It\u2019s on! Kick off: 12.30pm BST.",

      "bodyText": "Thunderstorms and high winds are expected to cause to further travel chaos and cancellations of high-profile events across Britain this weekend. Yellow warnings for stormy weather in Scotland and Northern Ireland, and for strong winds across Wales and most of England, have been predicted by the Met Office. Gusts of up to 50mph were recorded on Saturday morning in coastal areas, according to the forecaster Craig Snell. Heavy rain caused flooding on the west coast mainline between Carlisle and Lockerbie, leading to its closure. Network Rail Scotland tweeted pictures of the flooding and reported that the water level was up to 30cm above the rails. Rainfall has affected the northern border areas of England and Scotland generally, with further rain expected as heavy and slow-moving thunderstorms roll through the region. Snell said: \u201cNo matter where you are in the UK you\u2019re at risk of seeing some kind of localised disruption from wind. It\u2019s a case of staying in touch with weather forecasts and being prepared for extra travel time as there may be road closures due to localised flooding.\u201d While Sunday was expected to be less windy, Snell said the weather would still be unsettled. A nine-year-old was in police protection after being found under Brighton pier during the storms in the early hours of Saturday. Two adults who were with the child were arrested on suspicion of neglect and remain in custody. Volunteers from Brighton beach patrol said: \u201cThe child is now safe, which is a great outcome for us all.\u201d A fallen tree on the line between Ashford International and Hastings train stations caused service cancellations on Saturday morning, although the obstruction had since been cleared. Trees were brought down across Sussex, with at least two cars badly damaged after part of a tree collapsed in Old Shoreham Road in West Sussex. Another tree fell on Dyke Road in Brighton. Elsewhere, services have resumed between Guildford and Reading after a fallen tree was removed from the line near North Camp. In Russell Square in London, a short walk from Euston and Kings Cross stations where thousands were left stranded on Friday night after a nationwide power cut, a tree was blown over in the wind, forcing authorities to close the area. Further north, heavy rain flooded the line between Penrith North Lakes and Carlisle, meaning trains were running at a reduced speed with many services delayed or cancelled. Music festivals and smaller events have been cancelled because of the bad weather. Boardmasters, a surfing and music festival in Cornwall, was the first to be cancelled when organisers blamed \u201csevere weather conditions\u201d. Some people had travelled from as far as the US to attend the event, but only found out about the cancellation late on Tuesday. The event was expected to draw 50,000 people, and featured bands including the Wu-Tang Clan. A second music festival, Houghton, in Norfolk, was called off the following day after the weather dramatically worsened the already waterlogged site. Organisers of Bristol\u2019s international balloon fiesta scaled back the event, including cancelling Friday\u2019s mass ascent. Several weekend LGBT+ Pride events, including in Chester, Milton Keynes and Plymouth, were postponed for reasons of safety. Organisers for all three said they were working to rearrange the events. The first day of Blackpool air show on Saturday was cancelled when afternoon winds of 45mph were forecast. \u201cThe safety of the pilots and the watching public is paramount,\u201d a spokesman said, adding that Sunday\u2019s events were still scheduled to go ahead. The nearby St Anne\u2019s international kite festival was also cancelled. The London wildlife festival, scheduled on Saturday and Sunday at Walthamstow Wetlands, was cancelled after winds of 40mph were forecast. Organisers said they were unable to \u201cproceed safely\u201d but promised to refund tickets. On Saturday, Nantwich antiques market in Cheshire was cancelled due to the weather warning for strong winds.

      "body": "<p>Last week, a woman\u2019s sanction letter from the Department for Work and Pensions went viral on Twitter. Danielle John, from Cardiff, simply <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dannnimj/status/1157649743352348672\" title=\"\">wrote</a>: \u201cWas told to put this up on Twitter\u2026 this was because I had a miscarriage and missed appointment.\u201d</p> <p>These stories are fairly common now. We are used to seeing reports about people being sanctioned because of attending a funeral/cancer treatment/their child being in hospital. But this one struck me in particular because the language was so coldly efficient. Brief to the point of cruelty. I didn\u2019t know it was possible, even in a business letter, to say: \u201cWe\u2019re about to ruin your whole life\u201d without a shred of empathy.</p> <p>The letter, written in February 2017, starts in large font: \u201cYou\u2019ll lose some of your payment\u2026 This reduction will last 229 days.\u201d Two hundred and 29 days for a single missed appointment. That\u2019s almost 32 weeks of punishment. Or, if you prefer, February until August, with no money at all. When you consider that the harsher punishments for domestic violence introduced in 2018 suggest a sentence towards the upper limit of \u201ca fine to up to 26 weeks\u2019 custody\u201d for common assault, you have to wonder what fantastical, sadistic metric the DWP has used to calculate sanctions.</p> <p>The letter goes on to say that for her missed appointment \u2013 I just want to pause to remind you here that Danielle John was having a miscarriage at the time of missing this appointment \u2013 she would be sanctioned \u00a310.40 for each of those days. So, a total of \u00a32,381.60.</p> <p>After publication, the department of work and pensions challenged aspects of Danielle John\u2019s account. The department\u2019s spokesman said that: a sanction was imposed for five missed appointments over the course of eight months; sanctions do not affect all payments, only the standard payment, and other payments such as housing, child, disability and care benefits are not reduced; and the miscarriage had been accepted by Danielle John\u2019s work coach as a good reason for a missed appointment, which had then been rescheduled.</p> <p>For two years, I have been writing solely about exclusion based on my experiences of homelessness and poverty and the consequences of austerity in the deprived towns I grew up in. I\u2019ll admit to feeling a little jaded. Like many, I\u2019m tired and, with the rest of the nation, I\u2019m sitting with my popcorn watching the Brexit Shit Show in fascinated, terrified, distracted horror. As a consequence, part self-protection, part general fatigue, I\u2019ve stopped feeling as much as I should about the many stories of human hardship, pain and deprivation that austerity has inflicted on so many of the most vulnerable.</p> <p>But when Danielle posted her letter on Twitter, I took the time to read a little further. Yes, as usual, the letter was shocking, callous and entirely devoid of compassion. But then I discovered that Danielle had not been able to address the missed appointment \u2013 thus incurring 229 days of punishment \u2013 because, according to a doctor\u2019s letter she also posted, she was suffering \u201crecurrent miscarriages from August 2015 until October 2016\u201d and that \u201cshe probably would not have been able to work at that time\u201d.</p> <p>Danielle says she had attempted suicide by slashing her wrists a few months before her sanction meeting and they still sanctioned her. After she was left with no money from February to August in 2017, she says the stress and debt sent her back to drug use after being clean for 15 years and she is still repaying the debt she incurred during those months.</p> <p>Danielle John represents only one of these\u2026 I was going to say cases but of course she is a person. A human being who went through an undeniably human experience where she had no choice but to depend on a system hardwired to disregard humanity.</p> <p>I was born into a single-parent family in receipt of benefits for my entire childhood. For much of that time, we lived in temporary homeless accommodation and hostels. I left school at 15 with no qualifications and with severe depression and anxiety as a result of growing up in poverty. I\u2019m writing in this newspaper now because, no matter where we lived or how poor my education, I had access to libraries. I was able to get dependable benefits at 16 that allowed me to access housing benefit and offered me the stability to go to college, which was also free. Back then, I was just about able to afford university and once I was there I could access mental health treatment on the NHS and live in council housing.</p> <p>Decades into the future, when we look back and wonder how things have ended up as they are, I hope we don\u2019t have to say it\u2019s because we were distracted or jaded.

      "bodyText": "Wealthy financier Jeffrey Epstein has killed himself at a New York jail, according to authorities in New York and media reports. \u201cSaturday, August 10, 2019, at approximately 6.30am, inmate Jeffrey Edward Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell \u2026 subsequently pronounced dead by hospital staff,\u201d reads a statement from the Metropolitan Correctional Center where Epstein, 66, had been held without bail since his arrest on 6 July on charges of sex trafficking girls as young as 14. Multiple media reports said Epstein had died by suicide. The FBI is investigating the incident, and the attorney general, William Barr, said he had also opened an investigation by the Department of Justice\u2019s inspector general and was \u201cappalled\u201d by the death. \u201cEpstein\u2019s death raises serious questions that must be answered,\u201d Barr said. Lawyers for several of Epstein\u2019s alleged victims, including Virginia Giuffre, whose depositions detailing her experience as one of the financiers\u2019 \u201cslaves\u201d when she was just 14 years old were released yesterday, called for the investigations into his crimes to continue, despite his death. \u201cWe are hopeful that the government will continue to investigate and will focus on those who participated and facilitated Epstein\u2019s horrifying sex trafficking scheme that damaged so many,\u201d Sigrid McCawley said. The New York representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted shortly after Epstein\u2019s death was reported: \u201cWe need answers. Lots of them.\u201d Epstein\u2019s death comes a day after unsealed documents in New York revealed the extent of his abuse of young women at his home in Palm Beach, New York and the Virgin Islands. Epstein had been held since he was arrested on charges relating to alleged sexual misconduct from at least 2002 to 2005. He had pleaded not guilty to the charges. An earlier attempt to prosecute him on similar charges collapsed when authorities granted him an unusually generous deal to plead guilty to state prostitution charges in Florida. His death comes just days after he was found unconscious in a Manhattan jail cell with injuries to his neck, US media had reported, citing unidentified sources. It was not clear how he suffered those injuries. Two anonymous sources told New York\u2019s local NBC News 4 that Epstein\u2019s injuries may have been self-inflicted, while another said an assault by another inmate had not been ruled out. After the incident, Epstein had been placed on suicide watch. The Brooklyn-born financier made his name at the investment bank Bear Stearns before opening his own firm in 1982, managing money for clients with wealth in excess of $1bn. The business came with an intensive social schedule. Epstein positioned himself as a party figure in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida, and courted the rich, famous and powerful across America and the world. Epstein\u2019s circle of friends and acquaintances has included Donald Trump; Bill Clinton; Prince Andrew; Leslie Wexner, founder of the company that owns the Victoria\u2019s Secret lingerie brand; and many other prominent names in law, entertainment and politics. The first allegations of sexual abuse came in 2005 when a woman contacted the Palm Beach police, alleging her 14-year-old stepdaughter had been taken to Epstein\u2019s mansion by an older girl. The girl was allegedly paid $300 to strip and massage Epstein. That triggered an 11-month investigation that drew in the FBI. Interviews with alleged victims and witnesses showed that some of the girls involved were under 18. A large tranche of documents released on Friday from a lawsuit against Ghislaine Maxwell \u2013 who allegedly procured girls for the financier \u2013 contained both lurid claims and denials of world leaders\u2019 involvement in his alleged sex trafficking. Giuffre, who is among Epstein\u2019s many accusers, sued Maxwell in 2015, alleging the British socialite and daughter of the former media tycoon Robert Maxwell defamed her by claiming she was a liar in her accusations against Maxwell and Epstein. The documents appeared to bolster claims that many in Epstein\u2019s circle had taken part in his hospitality that included \u201cmassages\u201d from dozens of underage girls. After original attempts to prosecute Epstein collapsed, Trump\u2019s former labor secretary Alex Acosta came under repeated scrutiny for being seen as too lenient when he oversaw the case. In February, a judge ruled prosecutors in the case violated the law by concealing the deal from his underage alleged victims. Acosta resigned from his administration post in July. As Epstein\u2019s world unraveled, some of those who had sought his financial investment advice came forward while many more preferred to distance themselves, issuing statements painting their interactions in minimal terms. They included Trump and Clinton, who both issued statements saying they had had little to do with Epstein in recent years. Wexner said this week that the financier had \u201cmisappropriated\u201d more than $46m of his personal fortune. He said money went missing a decade ago, according to a letter to the Wexner Foundation. \u201cWe discovered that he had misappropriated vast sums of money from me and my family,\u201d Wexner said in the letter. \u201cThis was, frankly, a tremendous shock, even though it clearly pales in comparison to the unthinkable allegations against him now.\u201d Wexner hired Epstein in 1991 to manage his money, giving him vast power over his investment and tax affairs. Deutsche Bank and JP Morgan also said they were examining trades Epstein made when he was a client. The allegations of fraud came as Florida\u2019s governor, Ron DeSantis, ordered a state criminal investigation of a Palm Beach sheriff and former Palm Beach state attorney over their handling of Epstein\u2019s 2007 sex abuse case. The latest investigation, reported the Miami Herald, will probably focus on the lenient work privileges Epstein enjoyed while serving a 13-month sentence for soliciting prostitution from underage girls, the product of the controversial 2008 deal with federal authorities. The financier was allowed to work from his office six days a week, according to Palm Beach county sheriff\u2019s records. His personal limousine picked him up from jail as early as 7.15am and dropped him off as late as 10.40pm. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 800-273-8255.

      "bodyText": "The Labour party has called for a review into police welfare as new analysis reveals that hundreds of officers have killed themselves. Research shows that sickness and absence are running at near record levels across forces in England and Wales, with 336 officers classified as having killed themselves since 2001. Three of the four highest totals of annual absence on record were also in the last three years. The figures follow increased fears of violence against the police, the latest incident being a machete attack on PC Stuart Outten in east London on Tuesday. Although the 28-year-old received multiple stab wounds to his head and body, the officer managed to use a Taser electrical weapon on his assailant. On Saturday police officers on social media were demanding the end of \u201csingle-crewing\u201d \u2013 the deployment of unaccompanied officers \u2013 and the universal rollout of Taser electrical weapons to protect officers from physical attacks. The debate on the level of street violence comes as Boris Johnson prepares to unveil plans to increase the number of prison places. The prime minister, aiming to reposition the Conservatives as the party of law and order before a possible election, is expected to announce thousands more spaces in a renewed prison-building programme. On Monday, police chiefs, judges and prison bosses will attend a roundtable discussion at Downing Street on how to improve the criminal justice system and ensure offenders serve their full sentences. Johnson also wants more stop-and-search and place greater emphasis on \u201ctackling county lines, knife crime and moped gangs\u201d. Although Johnson has previously announced 20,000 extra police, Labour says the previous cuts and the loss of about 20,000 officers between 2009 and 2018 has had an impact on the mental health of many. Analysis by the party found that between 2001 and 2009, the average number of suicides a year of individuals classed as police officers at death, between the age of 20 and 74, was below 17. Yet from 2010 to 2017, the most recent data available, the average rose to 23 and follows concerns aired by the Police Federation of England and Wales that the \u201chigh-stress nature of the job is driving several police officers to consider suicide\u201d. Elsewhere, Labour\u2019s research reveals that the number of officers retired on medical grounds surged in 2011-12 and has remained high ever since, standing at 500 in 2017-18. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, said: \u201cThere is clearly a serious problem of welfare and morale among many officers.

      "body": "<p>A genial anarchy has descended on the Royal Festival Hall as the audience readies itself to receive <strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Anitta\" title=\"\">Anitta</a></strong>, Brazil\u2019s biggest pop star. Born Larissa de Macedo Machado in the same year the Meltdown festival began, the 26-year-old is curator Nile Rodgers\u2019 most eye-catching booking. The Chic guitarist has taken great care to ensure that his nine-day festival wraps its arms around as many ages, genders, sexualities and continents as it can, and Anitta embodies his inclusive ethos. A bisexual singer-songwriter-dancer-producer-manager brought up in the favelas and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/anitta/?hl=en\" title=\"\">raised up by Instagram</a>, Anitta has curated her career, her brand, to appeal to every possible demographic. Some, however, have criticised her for not denouncing the reactionary Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, quickly or loudly enough, as if her very existence wasn\u2019t a rebuke to his toxic stew of misogyny and homophobia.</p> <p>The energy Anitta inspires tonight is hugely female, slightly gay and head-spinningly euphoric. There\u2019s more Portuguese being spoken than English, and a bewildering number of you\u2019re-not-going-out-like-that outfits for a Tuesday night, not least on Nile himself, who\u2019s chosen a luminous yellow camo confusion that probably has a half-life of around 500 years. He\u2019s an expert, self-deprecating crowdpleaser, lying on the stage for front-row selfies, then leading us in a thunderous chant of \u201cAnitta! Anitta!\u201d before diving out of the way lest he get crushed by the oncoming pop juggernaut. Everyone who can stand is jumping and yelling, and the venue totters on the verge of an actual meltdown.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A great collaborator should make a great curator, and Rodgers is perhaps pop\u2019s greatest collaborator</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Breaking into her 2019 crossover album <em>Kisses</em><em>,</em> and its opening song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcMnvLzCeWM\" title=\"\">Atenci</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcMnvLzCeWM\" title=\"\">\u00f3n</a>, Anitta doesn\u2019t immediately have the best voice you\u2019ve ever heard, but it\u2019s strong and malleable, perfect for her music, a teetering tower of grinding, 15-certificate baile funk, reggaeton and modish urban pop-R&amp;B that slows down only briefly, if at all. The stagecraft is, like her setlist, uncomplicated, efficient, calculated to create ludicrously exciting results. It\u2019s focused around mostly female dancers in all-black outfits who spend a remarkable amount of their time on stage bent over, facing away from the audience, jiggling. Somehow it never seems sleazy, perhaps thanks to the ruthlessly professional, decisive choreography. It\u2019s no ifs, all butts, the women in control. When one male dancer has to slap Anitta\u2019s proffered bum, he does it sheepishly, looking pleadingly at the crowd as if he knows he\u2019s being paid to do it, but still isn\u2019t sure he won\u2019t be sacked in the morning.</p> <p>Anitta also slow-dances lasciviously with one of the female dancers, but mostly she crouches slightly as she sings, a hunter stalking the stage, setting out an unimpeachable string of hits as bait. The alpha and omega of her performance are the two long twerking interludes, when she sets the microphone aside and just goes for it. Within seconds, people in the aisles are imitating her moves, then freestyle dancing, singing and waving back at her. Later she does a mid-song <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/dec/01/slutdropping-empowering-dance-move\" title=\"\">slutdrop</a>, sticks a tongue out at the nearest phone and breaks into a brilliant grin, all without breaking stride or dropping a note.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c1fbbdd9b02ea49eb5fd6b94d9b8f386a5299084\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1fbbdd9b02ea49eb5fd6b94d9b8f386a5299084/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Master of ceremonies Nile Rodgers at the Royal Festival Hall.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Master of ceremonies Nile Rodgers at the Royal Festival Hall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Young/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019re from Brazil, we like to shake our asses,\u201d she declares with a knowing look, to a cacophonous reaction. \u201cIt\u2019s 10% singing, 90% shaking my ass,\u201d she lies. What this gig really adds up to is a bid for world domination.

      "bodyText": "A genial anarchy has descended on the Royal Festival Hall as the audience readies itself to receive Anitta, Brazil\u2019s biggest pop star. Born Larissa de Macedo Machado in the same year the Meltdown festival began, the 26-year-old is curator Nile Rodgers\u2019 most eye-catching booking. The Chic guitarist has taken great care to ensure that his nine-day festival wraps its arms around as many ages, genders, sexualities and continents as it can, and Anitta embodies his inclusive ethos. A bisexual singer-songwriter-dancer-producer-manager brought up in the favelas and raised up by Instagram, Anitta has curated her career, her brand, to appeal to every possible demographic. Some, however, have criticised her for not denouncing the reactionary Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, quickly or loudly enough, as if her very existence wasn\u2019t a rebuke to his toxic stew of misogyny and homophobia. The energy Anitta inspires tonight is hugely female, slightly gay and head-spinningly euphoric. There\u2019s more Portuguese being spoken than English, and a bewildering number of you\u2019re-not-going-out-like-that outfits for a Tuesday night, not least on Nile himself, who\u2019s chosen a luminous yellow camo confusion that probably has a half-life of around 500 years. He\u2019s an expert, self-deprecating crowdpleaser, lying on the stage for front-row selfies, then leading us in a thunderous chant of \u201cAnitta! Anitta!\u201d before diving out of the way lest he get crushed by the oncoming pop juggernaut. Everyone who can stand is jumping and yelling, and the venue totters on the verge of an actual meltdown. Breaking into her 2019 crossover album Kisses, and its opening song Atenci\u00f3n, Anitta doesn\u2019t immediately have the best voice you\u2019ve ever heard, but it\u2019s strong and malleable, perfect for her music, a teetering tower of grinding, 15-certificate baile funk, reggaeton and modish urban pop-R&amp;B that slows down only briefly, if at all. The stagecraft is, like her setlist, uncomplicated, efficient, calculated to create ludicrously exciting results. It\u2019s focused around mostly female dancers in all-black outfits who spend a remarkable amount of their time on stage bent over, facing away from the audience, jiggling. Somehow it never seems sleazy, perhaps thanks to the ruthlessly professional, decisive choreography. It\u2019s no ifs, all butts, the women in control. When one male dancer has to slap Anitta\u2019s proffered bum, he does it sheepishly, looking pleadingly at the crowd as if he knows he\u2019s being paid to do it, but still isn\u2019t sure he won\u2019t be sacked in the morning. Anitta also slow-dances lasciviously with one of the female dancers, but mostly she crouches slightly as she sings, a hunter stalking the stage, setting out an unimpeachable string of hits as bait. The alpha and omega of her performance are the two long twerking interludes, when she sets the microphone aside and just goes for it. Within seconds, people in the aisles are imitating her moves, then freestyle dancing, singing and waving back at her. Later she does a mid-song slutdrop, sticks a tongue out at the nearest phone and breaks into a brilliant grin, all without breaking stride or dropping a note. \u201cWe\u2019re from Brazil, we like to shake our asses,\u201d she declares with a knowing look, to a cacophonous reaction. \u201cIt\u2019s 10% singing, 90% shaking my ass,\u201d she lies. What this gig really adds up to is a bid for world domination. When a 26-year-old Madonna stares down balefully from 1984 on the giant video screen, Anitta\u2019s lineage is made clear: a woman come to rule, certain of your immediate compliance. Sometimes a great gig is a surrender, the comforting feeling of fainting gently into a lover\u2019s arms. Other times, specifically tonight, it\u2019s like being kidnapped and held without ransom. During RIP, a girl in the crowd grabs Anitta\u2019s arm as the singer stalks too close to the serried ranks of iPhones and just won\u2019t let go \u2013 another hostage begging not to be let free. Three days earlier, Chic\u2019s opening ceremony gig is much more of a stately swoon by comparison. As ever with Rodgers\u2019 fantastic band, there is an occasional frustration that a setlist entirely composed of some of the greatest songs ever sung celebrates their 7in rather than 12in forms: the true transcendence of I Want Your Love or Sister Sledge\u2019s Lost in Music and He\u2019s the Greatest Dancer is difficult, although not impossible, to locate in two minutes. Although Rodgers\u2019 fizzingly enthusiastic pre-gig opening address is fascinating, climaxing with a 15-minute explanation of how he rearranged David Bowie\u2019s demo of a folk song called Let\u2019s Dance into a worldwide disco-funk-pop smash, it\u2019s hard not to imagine how some of this time could have been spent on a properly expansive Studio 54 Chic live set. Still, when you have an endless store of stories that begin: \u201cSo, one night David Bowie walks into my bedroom...\u201d, you can do what you like with your time on stage. Yes, it\u2019s a shame that the festival is expensive and there aren\u2019t more free live performances, which means it\u2019s difficult for people to stumble across inspirational performers such as Anitta, or thrilling young Afrojazz collective Kokoroko, who bewitch the Queen Elizabeth Hall on Monday night. Still, the things Meltdown does well \u2013 smooth organisation, affable atmosphere and thoughtful curation \u2013 have been particularly notable in this 2019 edition.

As the last meadow browns, pale and faded from the sun, straggle along the hedgerows, I\u2019m seeing newly minted gatekeepers and common blues wherever I go.

Butterfly Conservation predicts that this year\u2019s hot weather could mean that the species will have its best ever summer.</p> <p>But we should remember that butterfly populations have always fluctuated from year to year, depending largely on the prevailing weather conditions. To assess these figures more carefully, we really need to look at the long-term trends, which are rather less positive. For many of Britain\u2019s favourite summer butterflies, including the once-common and familiar small tortoiseshell, there has been a steady decline over the past 40 years or so. This is due to a combination of factors, of which the most serious are the intensification of farming, combined with a more general fragmentation and loss of habitat.</p> <p>Peter Marren, a naturalist whose latest book,<a href=\"https://www.littletoller.co.uk/shop/books/little-toller/emperors-admirals-and-chimney-sweepers-by-peter-marren/\" title=\"\"> </a><em><a href=\"https://www.littletoller.co.uk/shop/books/little-toller/emperors-admirals-and-chimney-sweepers-by-peter-marren/\" title=\"\">Emperors, Admirals and Chimney Sweepers</a>,</em> tells the compelling story of the weird and wonderful names of our butterflies and moths, sounds a note of caution about the recent glut of sightings. While accepting that warm weather is good for adult butterflies, he points out that it may not be quite so favourable for their offspring, which often rely on a specific plant on which their caterpillars feed.</p> <p>\u201cWhere butterflies come unstuck in prolonged hot weather is if their larval food plants dry up \u2013 for example, if the chalkhill and adonis blues find only stunted, dried-up horseshoe vetch to lay their eggs on.\u201d As he points out, the famous long, hot summer of 1976 was a bumper year for these species, but the following year, 1977, a very poor one, as the majority of caterpillars failed to survive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f5b08dbf31979c270b6517cac2ab738ad1f27170\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5b08dbf31979c270b6517cac2ab738ad1f27170/0_22_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A red admiral\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A red admiral soaks up the sun in Whitley Bay.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Owen Humpreys/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He also notes that the recent mass appearance of painted ladies \u2013 recalling the extraordinary summer of 2009, when tens of millions of these butterflies could be seen throughout the UK \u2013 has absolutely nothing to do with the weather here in Britain. Instead, it indicates that conditions were favourable on the fringes of the Sahara in Morocco, where these butterflies came from.</p> <p>The ones we are seeing now are actually the offspring of an earlier generation, which arrived in the UK back in the late spring. These butterflies are now feeding to boost their energy levels in preparation for flying south again.</p> <p>Research by scientists at Butterfly Conservation confirms that the long-term population trend of some of our most charismatic insects is indeed downward, with more than three-quarters of the UK\u2019s butterflies and two-thirds of larger moths in decline.</p> <p>This has a knock-on effect on ecosystems and species: cuckoo chicks, for example, rely on their host parents finding large moth caterpillars for them to survive. But partly because of the shortage of these, cuckoo numbers have dropped by two-thirds since the early 1980s, mirroring the fall in their food supply.</p> <p>We need to know more about population trends in Britain\u2019s butterflies \u2013 as we do for any declining species and groups \u2013 so Butterfly Conservation urges people to take part in the charity\u2019s annual <a href=\"https://www.bigbutterflycount.org/\" title=\"\">Big Butterfly Count</a>. As its spokesperson Katie Callaghan explains: \u201cThis will provide a picture of how butterflies and larger moths have fared this year, compared with every summer over the last 10 years.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ac35f7d330771fc9d129460054cb46383fc2edb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ac35f7d330771fc9d129460054cb46383fc2edb/0_319_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The common blue\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The common blue has taken to the wing in record numbers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Searle/Butterfly Conservation/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Last year more than 100,000 people took part in the survey, logging almost a million individual butterflies during just 15 minutes of observations. This year\u2019s count ends on 11 August, and so, weather permitting, you still have a chance to take part. As Sir David Attenborough, the organisation\u2019s president, has pointed out, doing so helps contribute to our wider understanding of the UK\u2019s wildlife: \u201cThe Big Butterfly Count is about more than just counting butterflies \u2013 we\u2019ll be taking the pulse of nature.\u201d</p> <p>One of the biggest threats \u2013 and opportunities \u2013 facing Britain\u2019s butterflies is the current climate emergency. And, as with any response to higher temperatures, there will be winners and losers. Common and adaptable species, such as the peacock and comma, have already begun to extend their ranges northwards into Scotland, and are likely to continue to do well as the climate heats up. But, as Marren points out, rare and localised species are less likely to be able to respond to change, especially if, as predicted, it changes the nature of their more specialised habitats.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Big Butterfly Count is about more than just counting butterflies \u2013 we\u2019ll be taking the pulse of nature</p> <footer> <cite>David Attenborough</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One example is the wood white, a delicate butterfly found in woodlands in a few parts of southern England and the West Midlands, where it can be seen fluttering along woodland rides and the sheltered edges of clearings. Although higher temperatures should in theory allow the wood white to shift its range northwards, its inability to cross large swathes of unsuitable habitat means that it is unable to take advantage of a warming world.</p> <p>We would also expect that, as average spring and summer temperatures continue to rise, new butterfly species will cross the Channel, adding to our paltry total of fewer than 60 species (compared with almost 500 in Europe as a whole).</p> <p>Yet despite the rise in records of continental European species such as the large tortoiseshell, long-tailed blue and the spectacular queen of Spain fritillary during the past decade, none has yet managed to establish permanent breeding populations here.</p> <p>That\u2019s in sharp contrast to other groups of flying insects, such as moths and damselflies, of which several species have successfully colonised in Britain. Surely it is only a matter of time before those new butterflies join them.</p> <p>So, to sum up, some of Britain\u2019s butterflies are enjoying the benefits of hotter-than-average summers \u2013 at least in the short term \u2013 while, as with all our wild creatures, they face an uncertain future in a rapidly changing world.</p> <p>What is certain is that their loss would be a condemnation of our lack of stewardship of the natural world. For, perhaps more than any other living creatures, butterflies symbolise that rare combination of inspirational beauty and fragility, perfectly summed up by Marren in his book <em><a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/109/1097589/rainbow-dust/9781784703189.html\" title=\"\">Rainbow Dust</a></em>: \u201cI believe that the flutterings [of a butterfly\u2019s wing] can summon up at least a small breeze in the human soul. Let it blow \u2026 and let it remind we earthbound humans everywhere of the power and wonder of the natural world.\u201d</p> <p><em>Stephen Moss is a naturalist, author and lecturer based in Somerset </em></p> <p><em>\u2022 Persuading butterflies to choose your garden is relatively simple: provide plants that produce the nectar on which the adults will feed</em></p> <p><em><strong>\u2022 </strong>Native wild flowers are often considered to be more suitable than non-native ones, but the real key is making sure there are nectar-rich flowers in bloom from April through to October</em></p> <p><em>\u2022 Letting part of your garden go wild, with nettles, thistles, grasses and other \u201cweeds\u201d, will provide a place for caterpillars to feed and pupate, ensuring you have a new generation of butterflies later on</em></p> <p><em><strong>\u2022 </strong>In autumn, leave fallen fruit on the ground: painted ladies and red admirals love feeding on the fermenting juices</em></p> <p><em>\u2022 Avoid using pesticides and chemicals</em><strong>. </strong><em>Check out Butterfly Conservation\u2019s booklet, available when you join the charity, for more details. </em></p>",

We need to know more about population trends in Britain\u2019s butterflies \u2013 as we do for any declining species and groups \u2013 so Butterfly Conservation urges people to take part in the charity\u2019s annual Big Butterfly Count. As its spokesperson Katie Callaghan explains: \u201cThis will provide a picture of how butterflies and larger moths have fared this year, compared with every summer over the last 10 years.\u201d Last year more than 100,000 people took part in the survey, logging almost a million individual butterflies during just 15 minutes of observations. This year\u2019s count ends on 11 August, and so, weather permitting, you still have a chance to take part. As Sir David Attenborough, the organisation\u2019s president, has pointed out, doing so helps contribute to our wider understanding of the UK\u2019s wildlife: \u201cThe Big Butterfly Count is about more than just counting butterflies \u2013 we\u2019ll be taking the pulse of nature.\u201d One of the biggest threats \u2013 and opportunities \u2013 facing Britain\u2019s butterflies is the current climate emergency. And, as with any response to higher temperatures, there will be winners and losers. Common and adaptable species, such as the peacock and comma, have already begun to extend their ranges northwards into Scotland, and are likely to continue to do well as the climate heats up. But, as Marren points out, rare and localised species are less likely to be able to respond to change, especially if, as predicted, it changes the nature of their more specialised habitats. One example is the wood white, a delicate butterfly found in woodlands in a few parts of southern England and the West Midlands, where it can be seen fluttering along woodland rides and the sheltered edges of clearings. Although higher temperatures should in theory allow the wood white to shift its range northwards, its inability to cross large swathes of unsuitable habitat means that it is unable to take advantage of a warming world. We would also expect that, as average spring and summer temperatures continue to rise, new butterfly species will cross the Channel, adding to our paltry total of fewer than 60 species (compared with almost 500 in Europe as a whole). Yet despite the rise in records of continental European species such as the large tortoiseshell, long-tailed blue and the spectacular queen of Spain fritillary during the past decade, none has yet managed to establish permanent breeding populations here. That\u2019s in sharp contrast to other groups of flying insects, such as moths and damselflies, of which several species have successfully colonised in Britain. Surely it is only a matter of time before those new butterflies join them. So, to sum up, some of Britain\u2019s butterflies are enjoying the benefits of hotter-than-average summers \u2013 at least in the short term \u2013 while, as with all our wild creatures, they face an uncertain future in a rapidly changing world. What is certain is that their loss would be a condemnation of our lack of stewardship of the natural world. For, perhaps more than any other living creatures, butterflies symbolise that rare combination of inspirational beauty and fragility, perfectly summed up by Marren in his book Rainbow Dust: \u201cI believe that the flutterings [of a butterfly\u2019s wing] can summon up at least a small breeze in the human soul. Let it blow \u2026 and let it remind we earthbound humans everywhere of the power and wonder of the natural world.\u201d Stephen Moss is a naturalist, author and lecturer based in Somerset \u2022 Persuading butterflies to choose your garden is relatively simple: provide plants that produce the nectar on which the adults will feed \u2022 Native wild flowers are often considered to be more suitable than non-native ones, but the real key is making sure there are nectar-rich flowers in bloom from April through to October \u2022 Letting part of your garden go wild, with nettles, thistles, grasses and other \u201cweeds\u201d, will provide a place for caterpillars to feed and pupate, ensuring you have a new generation of butterflies later on \u2022 In autumn, leave fallen fruit on the ground: painted ladies and red admirals love feeding on the fermenting juices \u2022 Avoid using pesticides and chemicals.

With her Mercury-nominated mix of spoken word, rap and poetry, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/kate-tempest\">Kate Tempest</a> absorbs the agonies of the modern world and pours them into music that both wounds and heals.</p> <p>The south Londoner kicks off her debut at the Edinburgh international festival with a selection of her best and most commanding work. Framed by a red moon, she starts with the catastrophic Europe Is Lost, from her 2016 apocalyptic, electronic story cycle, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/oct/06/kate-tempest-let-them-eat-chaos-review-pop-poetry-and-politics-collide\">Let Them Eat Chaos</a>. \u201cKill what you find if it threatens you / No trace of love in the hunt for the bigger buck / Here in the land where nobody gives a fuck.\u201d From then on, the ferocity is relentless. When Tempest glides within the same note from speech to song, it is like plummeting down a rollercoaster, your stomach left mid-air.</p> <p>The cavernous Leith theatre suddenly seems minuscule as she makes the global intimate with her latest vertigo-shot of an album. Produced by Rick Rubin, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jun/14/kate-tempest-the-book-of-traps-and-lessons-review\">The Book of Traps and Lessons</a> has a starker score; Where Let Them Eat Chaos had a full band, this sees Tempest joined only by Clare Uchima, live mixing and on keys. Inhaling the hatred, lies and hypocrisy circling politics today, Tempest fumes in Three Sided Coin: \u201cOur leaders aren\u2019t even pretending not to be demons.\u201d Arms wipe eyes dry as she mourns the futility of protest in Holy Elixir and, for the first time of the night, words take a backseat as the bass rouses and the synths rage, with a red wash descending on the stage, intense and blinding. She hunches and the room shakes; this is a reckoning.</p> <p>Having been failed by politics and structures we should have been able to trust, Tempest searches for truth in love and music instead. Loathing, optimistic, lustful: this gig is all the more painful for the intersection of fury with joy. Her eyes are closed as she balances desire and self-preservation in I Trap You, her cynical, hesitant counter to Firesmoke, an impossibly tender love letter performed over a stripped-back beat. \u201cGentle, ferocious, we are open,\u201d she intones to the woman she wants to untangle, whose body is a map she wants to explore. In that line, she sums up the tone of her set.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4c23c7678fd2ace046268c67503db29ea4c09b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4c23c7678fd2ace046268c67503db29ea4c09b5/0_304_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kate Tempest\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The lights are her backing dancers.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The lights are Tempest\u2019s backing dancers.

      "bodyText": "Rarely can a room have felt so alive. With her Mercury-nominated mix of spoken word, rap and poetry, Kate Tempest absorbs the agonies of the modern world and pours them into music that both wounds and heals. The south Londoner kicks off her debut at the Edinburgh international festival with a selection of her best and most commanding work. Framed by a red moon, she starts with the catastrophic Europe Is Lost, from her 2016 apocalyptic, electronic story cycle, Let Them Eat Chaos. \u201cKill what you find if it threatens you / No trace of love in the hunt for the bigger buck / Here in the land where nobody gives a fuck.\u201d From then on, the ferocity is relentless. When Tempest glides within the same note from speech to song, it is like plummeting down a rollercoaster, your stomach left mid-air. The cavernous Leith theatre suddenly seems minuscule as she makes the global intimate with her latest vertigo-shot of an album. Produced by Rick Rubin, The Book of Traps and Lessons has a starker score; Where Let Them Eat Chaos had a full band, this sees Tempest joined only by Clare Uchima, live mixing and on keys. Inhaling the hatred, lies and hypocrisy circling politics today, Tempest fumes in Three Sided Coin: \u201cOur leaders aren\u2019t even pretending not to be demons.\u201d Arms wipe eyes dry as she mourns the futility of protest in Holy Elixir and, for the first time of the night, words take a backseat as the bass rouses and the synths rage, with a red wash descending on the stage, intense and blinding. She hunches and the room shakes; this is a reckoning. Having been failed by politics and structures we should have been able to trust, Tempest searches for truth in love and music instead. Loathing, optimistic, lustful: this gig is all the more painful for the intersection of fury with joy. Her eyes are closed as she balances desire and self-preservation in I Trap You, her cynical, hesitant counter to Firesmoke, an impossibly tender love letter performed over a stripped-back beat. \u201cGentle, ferocious, we are open,\u201d she intones to the woman she wants to untangle, whose body is a map she wants to explore. In that line, she sums up the tone of her set. The lights are Tempest\u2019s backing dancers. Choreographed to the beat then lashing out on its own, Eliza Moore\u2019s lighting design spits, spins and blinds. Only occasionally does it stay with Tempest, as for Hold Your Own, which she performs under a single golden beam. Weaving together her own story with myth and politics, the song \u2013 which also gives it name to her first poetry collection \u2013 is tenderness scrubbed raw. Too soon, it\u2019s the finale. \u201cI don\u2019t know the answers,\u201d she says, at once optimistic and despairing in People\u2019s Faces, the soft song fuller with an almost symphonic underscore. \u201cBut I still have things to say.\u201d Having detailed the uncertainty and anger of our times, she now digs until she finds hope.

The biggest joker in Cheika\u2019s deck was James O\u2019Connor, whose vision and ball playing ability saw him expertly combine with Reece Hodge to set up the winger for two tries. The 29-year-old never looked out of place in his first Test start at 13, showing Australia what the Wallabies\u2019 back-line could look like with a natural ball player in wide channels.</p> <p>While there were mitigating circumstances with Barrett\u2019s red card, the Wallabies\u2019 gameplan of keeping ball in hand rather than kicking for territory proved key. The half-back combination of Nic White and Christian Lealiifano started together for the first time and combined admirably. White was pivotal in the Wallabies\u2019 performance, orchestrating the forwards while looking equally dangerous with regular breaks from the base of the ruck.</p> <p>Even with 14 men, the All Blacks did not give up hope, making the most of the their limited time in possession. Both their first-half tries came shortly after turning over the Wallabies, while the playmaking duo of Richie Mo\u2019unga and Beauden Barrett linked up nicely after the break for a try.</p> <p>In the build-up, much was made of the All Blacks\u2019 potentially lethal back row selection of Ardie Savea, Sam Cane and Kieran Read.

      "bodyText": "Just six weeks out from the opening game of their Rugby World Cup campaign, the Wallabies restored pride to the gold jersey as they romped to a famous 47-26 victory against New Zealand in Perth and inflicted the highest points tally the All Blacks have conceded in a Test match. The visitors played the second half with 14 men after Scott Barrett was dismissed for a shoulder charge to the head of Michael Hooper, with the Wallabies making the extra player count after the interval. The hosts impressed throughout the 80 minutes though to ensure that the Bledisloe Cup goes down to a decider in Auckland next weekend. The six-try showing was a clear vindication of Michael Cheika\u2019s experimental team selection. The biggest joker in Cheika\u2019s deck was James O\u2019Connor, whose vision and ball playing ability saw him expertly combine with Reece Hodge to set up the winger for two tries. The 29-year-old never looked out of place in his first Test start at 13, showing Australia what the Wallabies\u2019 back-line could look like with a natural ball player in wide channels. While there were mitigating circumstances with Barrett\u2019s red card, the Wallabies\u2019 gameplan of keeping ball in hand rather than kicking for territory proved key. The half-back combination of Nic White and Christian Lealiifano started together for the first time and combined admirably. White was pivotal in the Wallabies\u2019 performance, orchestrating the forwards while looking equally dangerous with regular breaks from the base of the ruck. Even with 14 men, the All Blacks did not give up hope, making the most of the their limited time in possession. Both their first-half tries came shortly after turning over the Wallabies, while the playmaking duo of Richie Mo\u2019unga and Beauden Barrett linked up nicely after the break for a try. In the build-up, much was made of the All Blacks\u2019 potentially lethal back row selection of Ardie Savea, Sam Cane and Kieran Read. However, the hosts were able to nullify their threat for the most part, with the Wallabies forwards deserving credit for limiting the opposition back row\u2019s opportunities to attack the ball at the breakdown. The opening 20 minutes was fitting of the atmosphere inside the sell-out Optus Stadium in Perth, which ferociously embraced the national anthems of both sides following a minute\u2019s silence for Sir Brian Lochore. The Wallabies kept ball in hand in the opening exchanges with Marika Koroibete and Lealiifano both offering promise after breaking through the All Blacks defensive line. Western Australia has been home to some of the lowest moments of O\u2019Connor\u2019s Wallabies career. It is now home to some of the finest after he set up Hodge for the first of two tries after running a lovely line on the right flank. The All Blacks\u2019 response was instant as Anton Lienert-Brown touched down after Jack Goodhue\u2019s kick caused calamity in the Wallabies\u2019 in-goal area. Rieko Ioane added a second try just four minutes later as the visitors took the lead for the only time in the game. Scott Barrett\u2019s red card in the 40th minute was undoubtedly a turning point \u2013 J\u00e9r\u00f4me Garc\u00e8s left with little choice to dismiss New Zealand\u2019s No 4 following World Rugby\u2019s stricter laws on head contact in play. The Wallabies came firing out of the blocks after the break, crossing twice in the first 10 minutes of the second half as Lukhan Salakaia-Loto scored his first Test try before White dived over in the corner to cap a fine scrum-half display. Beauden Barret pulled a try back for the All Blacks following that link-up with Mo\u2019unga, before Koroibete and then Hodge, again after good work from O\u2019Connor, put the game beyond doubt. Mo\u2019unga crossed straight from the restart, only for Kurtley Beale to get his name on the scoresheet to round off a resounding Wallabies\u2019 victory and provide hope for Australia fans \u2013 and prove the All Blacks are indeed beatable.",

This is exactly this kind of viral marketing that has made Self-Portrait the runaway fashion success story of the past five years. In opting to wear one of his distinctive lace designs, the Duchess of Sussex followed in the footsteps of Jennifer Lopez, Beyonc\u00e9, Reese Witherspoon, Zendaya, Priyanka Chopra, Michelle Obama, Maisie Williams and Kate Middleton, who all sent the social stratosphere into meltdown about what they were wearing \u2013 albeit without a swing tag in sight.</p> <p>It\u2019s a familiar fashion story: a celebrity wears a designer dress, the world wants it but only the wealthy can afford it; cue myriad high-street copies at a cut price. Here lies the secret to Self-Portrait\u2019s success. From day one, Chong has defiantly kept his prices at the lower end of the designer market. They consistently hover around the \u00a3350 mark. As a result, if someone wants to wear what their icon has modelled, many will have a chance of buying the real thing (the accessible messaging is clearly attractive to those in the public eye).</p> <p>\u201cFrom the start I wanted to create a brand that is really inclusive, so price point was always a big part of it,\u201d he says. \u201cAt the start, brands [either] designed for high fashion or low fashion and there was little in between.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s achievable, he says, by considering how price dictates design rather than the other way around. \u201cWhen I started, I had really small capital and had to make money within nine months, so I didn\u2019t have the luxury of being crazy and fabulous. I had to come up with a really creative idea to see how it could work in that term.\u201d The brainwave was to use expensive fabrics, but sparingly: \u201cIf I want to make a dress for \u00a3300 using fabric that is \u00a350 per metre, we only use a quarter of a metre, put it on the best part of the body and then mix it with other fabrics.\u201d Chong would like to use more expensive materials, but says: \u201cI design for people to wear, not just for my own creative desire.\u201d As it turns out, his mixed-texture method has become a much-coveted USP.</p> <p>Intricate lace panels made on a bespoke laser-cutting machine in China are still his signature. Chong frequently visits the factories that produce his clothes, and has technicians there make sure working conditions, quality and ethical processes adhere to international standards. \u201cEverything we do is tested against industry standards, which is actually the most expensive thing for us \u2013 but it\u2019s really important that anything that is not good for the environment we don\u2019t do.\u201d</p> <p>If a designer label selling at these prices sounds commonplace, that\u2019s because many brands \u2013 from Ganni to Kitri \u2013 now do the same. But when Self-Portrait launched in 2013, the fashion world wasn\u2019t ready. \u201cFive years ago, it was so difficult to get into [somewhere like] Net-a-Porter because they loved the pieces but didn\u2019t know where to place us because we would conflict with other brands. Our dresses were \u00a3300, but [everything else like it] was practically \u00a32,000.\u201d</p> <p>After the online retailer <a href=\"https://www.shopbop.com/\" title=\"\">Shopbop</a> bought his first collection of 17 pieces in 2013, his break into the mainstream came when Selfridges took a punt and bought his second the following year. \u201cWe did a big event [in store] and a week later everything was gone,\u201d he says. \u201cNet-a-Porter picked us up [shortly after] and sold out in 24 hours. I checked my phone the morning after the collection went live and called the buyers and asked if there was something wrong with their website as nothing was for sale. They said, \u2018No it\u2019s sold out.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca9b791a81042ccd0eb1abcb7817fc86cca944ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca9b791a81042ccd0eb1abcb7817fc86cca944ee/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Dresses you can have memories with\u2019.

She affirms its \u201cinstant popularity really paved the way for the explosion of successful contemporary brands\u201d. Five years later, Self-Portrait is now stocked at 13 leading online retailers and has 375 stockists in 70 countries.</p> <p>Pivotal to Self-Portrait\u2019s success has undoubtedly been tapping into wedding season. Since the summer of 2015, a year after the brand was launched, it has been the unofficial go-to for wedding guest and, frequently, bridesmaid attire. Several silhouettes to fit a range of shapes and sizes, fresh prints and a quality finish have made them a sensation \u2013 not to mention their look-at-me appeal.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I design I imagine what kind of attention it is going to get. When someone walks [into a venue wearing my dress] I want people to turn their heads. If someone buys a new dress and it doesn\u2019t get noticed, it\u2019s a waste of money!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"597d701f4af419a8bee6207b1b6b0691913e971e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/597d701f4af419a8bee6207b1b6b0691913e971e/494_67_1252_2946/425.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I want to turn heads\u2019: Reese Witherspoon in Self-Portrait.\" width=\"425\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I want to turn heads\u2019: Reese Witherspoon in Self-Portrait.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Startraks/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The value for money extends to an awareness by Chong of how women want to shop. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to have pieces that you can wear over and over and have fun with. There are some dresses that you couldn\u2019t have fun with because they are too expensive and you worry about spilling a drink on them. You\u2019re not <em>so</em> worried with my dresses. They are dresses you can have memories with, which is important.\u201d</p> <p>At 40, Chong\u2019s own sense of mischief \u2013 not to mention his slight frame and smooth complexion \u2013 belies his years. He reveals with delight that at his Mayfair flagship behind Bond Street (where, contrary to Net-a-Porter\u2019s original placement concerns, being situated next door to the world\u2019s luxury labels pays off at his prices) he regularly hits the shop floor incognito. \u201cPeople think I am a shop assistant,\u201d he says, rolling his head back laughing. \u201cBut it\u2019s important because if people know who I am, they say how beautiful things are, not: \u2018This doesn\u2019t fit me properly.\u2019 Getting direct comments from my customers is really honest and makes the collections stronger.\u201d</p> <p>It was while studying art in his native Malaysia that the fashion match was struck. Having moved to Kuala Lumpur from the island of Penang at 18, he studied art under a Central Saint Martins graduate. He moved to London and by 2002 had graduated from the prestigious school with a BA in womenswear. He went on to spend his 20s and early 30s working in the design teams at several brands in the UK, including Topshop, and after a short stint at Three Floor, the company he co-founded in 2011, he went solo with Self-Portrait in late 2013.</p> <p>Like many fashion designers, Chong adopts a uniform when it comes to his own wardrobe. \u201cIn the morning when you\u2019re thinking about what you\u2019re going to design, you just think about what\u2019s comfortable for the day.\u201d He can currently be spotted in white T-shirts from Prada, Jil Sander shorts and his signature trilby from the hat maker <a href=\"https://www.christys-hats.com/\" title=\"\">Christys\u2019</a> in St James\u2019s on his short morning walk from his Shoreditch home to his Hoxton studio.</p> <p>As well as launching swimwear, sunglasses, shoes and a collaboration with the denim brand Lee in the past year, expansion into Scandinavia (currently untapped) and working on distribution in Japan and China are on the cards. Most recently has been the launch of the Icons collection. \u201cLots of people were asking us on social media to bring back a dress that they didn\u2019t get a chance to buy, so we reissued [the most popular] from the past five years.\u201d Customers who missed out on Michelle, Maisie and Meghan\u2019s dresses the first time round have the opportunity to snap them up. Swing tag optional.</p> <p><em>Self-Portrait Icons collection is available now; <a href=\"https://www.self-portrait-studio.com/\" title=\"\">self-portrait-studio.com</a></em></p>",

Pivotal to Self-Portrait\u2019s success has undoubtedly been tapping into wedding season. Since the summer of 2015, a year after the brand was launched, it has been the unofficial go-to for wedding guest and, frequently, bridesmaid attire. Several silhouettes to fit a range of shapes and sizes, fresh prints and a quality finish have made them a sensation \u2013 not to mention their look-at-me appeal. \u201cWhen I design I imagine what kind of attention it is going to get. When someone walks [into a venue wearing my dress] I want people to turn their heads. If someone buys a new dress and it doesn\u2019t get noticed, it\u2019s a waste of money!\u201d The value for money extends to an awareness by Chong of how women want to shop. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to have pieces that you can wear over and over and have fun with. There are some dresses that you couldn\u2019t have fun with because they are too expensive and you worry about spilling a drink on them. You\u2019re not so worried with my dresses. They are dresses you can have memories with, which is important.\u201d At 40, Chong\u2019s own sense of mischief \u2013 not to mention his slight frame and smooth complexion \u2013 belies his years. He reveals with delight that at his Mayfair flagship behind Bond Street (where, contrary to Net-a-Porter\u2019s original placement concerns, being situated next door to the world\u2019s luxury labels pays off at his prices) he regularly hits the shop floor incognito. \u201cPeople think I am a shop assistant,\u201d he says, rolling his head back laughing. \u201cBut it\u2019s important because if people know who I am, they say how beautiful things are, not: \u2018This doesn\u2019t fit me properly.\u2019 Getting direct comments from my customers is really honest and makes the collections stronger.\u201d It was while studying art in his native Malaysia that the fashion match was struck. Having moved to Kuala Lumpur from the island of Penang at 18, he studied art under a Central Saint Martins graduate. He moved to London and by 2002 had graduated from the prestigious school with a BA in womenswear. He went on to spend his 20s and early 30s working in the design teams at several brands in the UK, including Topshop, and after a short stint at Three Floor, the company he co-founded in 2011, he went solo with Self-Portrait in late 2013. Like many fashion designers, Chong adopts a uniform when it comes to his own wardrobe. \u201cIn the morning when you\u2019re thinking about what you\u2019re going to design, you just think about what\u2019s comfortable for the day.\u201d He can currently be spotted in white T-shirts from Prada, Jil Sander shorts and his signature trilby from the hat maker Christys\u2019 in St James\u2019s on his short morning walk from his Shoreditch home to his Hoxton studio. As well as launching swimwear, sunglasses, shoes and a collaboration with the denim brand Lee in the past year, expansion into Scandinavia (currently untapped) and working on distribution in Japan and China are on the cards. Most recently has been the launch of the Icons collection. \u201cLots of people were asking us on social media to bring back a dress that they didn\u2019t get a chance to buy, so we reissued [the most popular] from the past five years.\u201d Customers who missed out on Michelle, Maisie and Meghan\u2019s dresses the first time round have the opportunity to snap them up. Swing tag optional. Self-Portrait Icons collection is available now; self-portrait-studio.com",

It\u2019s a very special night in Perth, and for long-suffering fans of Australian rugby it\u2019s a performance, and a result, for the scrapbooks. By Kieran Read\u2019s own admission the Wallabies were \u201cbrilliant\u201d. And ahead of a World Cup for which expectations have been incredibly low, it\u2019s a huge shot in the arm for the players, the staff, and for Australian rugby fans.</p> <p>61,241 fans packed in - although many of them supporting the All Blacks, it must be said. But while the champagne corks are still popping it\u2019s hard not to see reasons not to get caught in the ephemeral bubbles. For Western Australians witnessing one of the nation\u2019s greatest victories over its nearest and greatest rivals there will be the bitter lining of heading home reflecting on the loss of their own Super Rugby franchise that denies them such spectacles on a regular occasion at this special venue.</p> <p>In terms of the Bledisloe Cup - it\u2019s a great win (but could ultimately seen the trophy stay in NZ with a loss next week at Eden Park). In terms of the Rugby Championship - it\u2019s a great win (but could see the South Africans run away with the competition with a win over Argentina). In terms of the World Cup - it\u2019s a great win (but could put opponents on guard as to Australia\u2019s new combinations and attacking ethos).</p> <p>Would you go as far to say a Pyrrhic victory? Probably not. But it\u2019s one that will have stung the All Blacks. Steve Hansen will not have enjoyed watching his side concede 47-points against any one; let alone New Zealand\u2019s traditional rivals.</p> <p>Some will say the red card to Scott Barrett turned the contest. We will never know, but it would have been interesting to see how this one would have unfolded 15-v-15.</p> <p>Take nothing away from Australia though - they looked imperious at times: Nic White delivered quick ball, got the backs moving sharply and the returning James O\u2019Connor combined brilliantly with Hodge, giving Australia a play-making option out wide. The set piece, as it was against Argentina, remained solid - good at the scrum, good in the lineout. Michael Hooper has his detractors, but he was immense, the skipper - here, there and everywhere - involved, never giving up, chasing everything down.</p> <p>As stand alone performances go, it\u2019s as good as any we\u2019ve seen from the Wallabies. Now to see if this becomes the launch pad for something greater.</p> <p>Thanks for your company tonight - on what was a remarkable night of rugby. Stay tuned for next week\u2019s return clash. From the one, the only, Eden Park.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-10T12:21:53.415Z\">at 1.21pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d4eafc18f0896be8f8f6c62\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-10T11:55:51.777Z\">12.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Plenty of traffic on Twitter as well:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/paganbilly/status/1160149315874119680\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/rrjparkin?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@rrjparkin</a> Rugby Union needs a competitive Australian team and it looks as if we have one again at last</p>&mdash; mick wood (@paganbilly) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paganbilly/status/1160149315874119680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 10, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Mick - it\u2019s interesting. How much can Australian rugby supporters read into this result?</p> <p>One swallow doesn\u2019t a summer make - but if you consider where the Wallabies have been a year or so back, it definitely looks promising.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been a big fan of Will Genia, but you can\u2019t deny the influence Nic White has had on proceedings tonight. Suddenly a 2018-coloured nightmare (Phipps? Foley?) is starting to recede - could White and Lealiifano be the combination to guide Australia in Japan?</p> <p>James O\u2019Connor was also a big inclusion pre-game - and in his combination with Hodge he\u2019s laid down a massive marker to edge himself ahead of Kuridrani in the outside centre role.</p> <p>Two from two in the key selections, for Cheika and the Rugby Australia selection panel.

Eden Park. Still. Few gave them a chance pre-game (please don\u2019t re-read my opening comments to this one) - but if this was K2, then beating the All Blacks in Auckland would be undoubtedly Everest.</p> <p>Much to ponder for Steve Hansen though. 47 points. It\u2019s a record points-tally put on the ABs by Australia. No doubt many will say that\u2019s due to the first half red card, but it\u2019s still a few. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d4ead668f08c7e177d48241\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-10T11:44:01.396Z\">12.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And now Kieran Read:</p> <p>\u201cThey were really good tonight, and we knew that would be the case.

      "bodyText": "So, first things first. It\u2019s a very special night in Perth, and for long-suffering fans of Australian rugby it\u2019s a performance, and a result, for the scrapbooks. By Kieran Read\u2019s own admission the Wallabies were \u201cbrilliant\u201d. And ahead of a World Cup for which expectations have been incredibly low, it\u2019s a huge shot in the arm for the players, the staff, and for Australian rugby fans. 61,241 fans packed in - although many of them supporting the All Blacks, it must be said. But while the champagne corks are still popping it\u2019s hard not to see reasons not to get caught in the ephemeral bubbles. For Western Australians witnessing one of the nation\u2019s greatest victories over its nearest and greatest rivals there will be the bitter lining of heading home reflecting on the loss of their own Super Rugby franchise that denies them such spectacles on a regular occasion at this special venue. In terms of the Bledisloe Cup - it\u2019s a great win (but could ultimately seen the trophy stay in NZ with a loss next week at Eden Park). In terms of the Rugby Championship - it\u2019s a great win (but could see the South Africans run away with the competition with a win over Argentina). In terms of the World Cup - it\u2019s a great win (but could put opponents on guard as to Australia\u2019s new combinations and attacking ethos). Would you go as far to say a Pyrrhic victory? Probably not. But it\u2019s one that will have stung the All Blacks. Steve Hansen will not have enjoyed watching his side concede 47-points against any one; let alone New Zealand\u2019s traditional rivals. Some will say the red card to Scott Barrett turned the contest. We will never know, but it would have been interesting to see how this one would have unfolded 15-v-15. Take nothing away from Australia though - they looked imperious at times: Nic White delivered quick ball, got the backs moving sharply and the returning James O\u2019Connor combined brilliantly with Hodge, giving Australia a play-making option out wide. The set piece, as it was against Argentina, remained solid - good at the scrum, good in the lineout. Michael Hooper has his detractors, but he was immense, the skipper - here, there and everywhere - involved, never giving up, chasing everything down. As stand alone performances go, it\u2019s as good as any we\u2019ve seen from the Wallabies. Now to see if this becomes the launch pad for something greater. Thanks for your company tonight - on what was a remarkable night of rugby. Stay tuned for next week\u2019s return clash. From the one, the only, Eden Park. Plenty of traffic on Twitter as well: Mick - it\u2019s interesting. How much can Australian rugby supporters read into this result? One swallow doesn\u2019t a summer make - but if you consider where the Wallabies have been a year or so back, it definitely looks promising. I\u2019ve been a big fan of Will Genia, but you can\u2019t deny the influence Nic White has had on proceedings tonight. Suddenly a 2018-coloured nightmare (Phipps? Foley?) is starting to recede - could White and Lealiifano be the combination to guide Australia in Japan? James O\u2019Connor was also a big inclusion pre-game - and in his combination with Hodge he\u2019s laid down a massive marker to edge himself ahead of Kuridrani in the outside centre role. Two from two in the key selections, for Cheika and the Rugby Australia selection panel. Kudos where it\u2019s due. A flood of terrific emails coming through during that second half - my apologies I couldn\u2019t include more in; it was just a frenetic pace to that entire match. This from shortly into the second half from Martin Turnbull - or as I call him - Nostradam-tin Turnbull - is worth a mention: Not wishing to tempt fate but what is Australia\u2019s record win against the Kiwis? Here\u2019s hoping!!! There\u2019s your answer, Martin. It\u2019s 47 points. Not to pour cold water on any Australian celebrations - a reminder though, that due to the World Cup it\u2019s a reduced two-game Bledisloe Cup series this year - which means a win next week in the return fixture is enough for the All Blacks to retain the trophy for a sixteenth-consecutive year. Oh, and did I mention where that return fixture will take place? Eden Park. Still. Few gave them a chance pre-game (please don\u2019t re-read my opening comments to this one) - but if this was K2, then beating the All Blacks in Auckland would be undoubtedly Everest. Much to ponder for Steve Hansen though. 47 points. It\u2019s a record points-tally put on the ABs by Australia. No doubt many will say that\u2019s due to the first half red card, but it\u2019s still a few. And now Kieran Read: \u201cThey were really good tonight, and we knew that would be the case. We couldn\u2019t get our hand on the ball and that really hurt us after half-time. We can\u2019t give away that many missed tackles - we have to be better than that. We\u2019ll get back to Auckland, and we\u2019ll build for next week.\u201d Well. What did you make of that? A big morale booster for Australia? A wake up call for the All Blacks? An absolutely battered Michael Hooper speaks post-game: \u201cWe\u2019re delighted. It was a terrific performance. It\u2019s a really nice build for us - we\u2019re growing as a team. I thought we had some good go-forward. It\u2019s a step at a time. We did it here tonight, but we pack our bags tomorrow and look forward.\u201d The hooter sounds - Genia kicks it into touch - and that\u2019s the game! It\u2019s a record win over New Zealand by the Wallabies. And the home crowd, the home players - they\u2019re delighted! Number six in the world sinks world number one. They jump above New Zealand in the Rugby Championship standings (although with the Springboks still to play it\u2019s surely now the South Africans\u2019 competition to win). What. A. Game! Yessss! There\u2019s a cherry on top, and what a deserving try-scorer. Toomua shifts early, the backs flick the hands, but it\u2019s a phenomnenal line run from Beale! Like a hot knife through butter, and his teammates mob him in sheer delight! Toomua adds the extras from right in front. 77 min: Have you ever seen Michael Cheika so composed in the coaches box? Especially against New Zealand! No blow ups tonight - and why not. His side have been excellent. It\u2019s Australia with the scrum feed - surely that\u2019s it from here. They need to hold on to it, and play some sensible rugby. 76 min: A chance for some much-needed drinks. All Blacks with a scrum just inside their half. They need to score from this set piece to keep the game alive. What can TJ Perenara come up with? 74 min: Savea with a big fend on the new man Banks! He gets one-on-one on the outside, but there\u2019s nobody backing him up. Rampaging run from the backliner - that was real danger there again for Australia. Danger averted, and it\u2019s Hooper - he\u2019s been everywhere, hasn\u2019t he - who pops up at the vital moment. 73 min: This game has just been frenetic! There will be some tired, tired bodies tonight. But if you\u2019re Eddie Jones about to name your World Cup squad tomorrow, you\u2019d be licking your lips. When\u2019s the last time you\u2019ve seen the All Blacks so vulnerable? 72 min: Wowee wow. Straight from the restart - they play short the ABs, it\u2019s Read who rises for the tap back, it\u2019s straight to Laumape - and he runs clean through! Beale was up in the line, there was nobody at home, and that\u2019s as easy a seven points as you\u2019ll see anywhere. They refuse to lie down, the All Blacks! As you\u2019d expect. Put that one down to the one-man advantage. Genia flicks wide to Toomua, and it\u2019s quickly to O\u2019Connor who picks out his Western Force teammate. That\u2019s the second time those two have combined, and with deadly effect both times. Toomua gets it with first conversion - and we\u2019ve hit 40. It\u2019s a record high score against the All Blacks! And we\u2019ve still ten to play. Rub your eyes, Wallabies fans! 66 min: Hooper with a big steal! Australia boot it long, but it\u2019s straight to Barrett. New Zealand bring back again - they\u2019re starting to see a lot of the pill, which wasn\u2019t the case in the first half. Perenara spreads wide, before Mo\u2019unga looks to turn the defence around. Beale takes on the defensive line and it\u2019s a terrific return from the fullback! He brings in back 30m before finding a teammate. O\u2019Connor flicks to Koroibete, and he springs down the touchline! He looks inside, for Hooper - but it\u2019s a diving intervention from Read! The two captains, clashing again. Big effort, Read - he saves a try. 64 min: A scrum to NZ 15m inside their own half. A wistful looking Dane Coles on the bench - few have worked harder than him tonight, but they find themselves down, the ABs. New Zealand spread wide, but Ioane runs out of real estate and chances a ball back inside which Read cleans up. 61 min: Australian lineout on the 22m. Salakaia-Loto with the lineout claim and then Kerevi smashes through the line again! White goes close, about a metre out. Rodda sets it up again. Ooph. A big hole in the All Blacks defence - about three of the forwards line up and it draws the interest of the NZ defence, but its the winger who steals in and skips over the line! When\u2019s the last time we\u2019ve seen the Wallabies put 30+ points on the ABs? you don\u2019t want to go too early - but could something special be happening here tonight, in Perth? 59 min: ABs on the attack once more. They probe right. Hard to get round on the edges when you\u2019re down a man, and the Wallabies shift across well. Mo\u2019unga skips and weaves. But we\u2019ve a turnover! Great work from the fresh man - Tongan Thor! It\u2019s Tupou who steals. They needs some ball-in-hand time now, Australia. It\u2019s been a good ten minutes for New Zealand. 56 min: So Scott Barrett can\u2019t do much about his red card, but his brother Beauden sure can. New Zealand right back in this. Big 10-15 minutes to come now. Australia back on the attack, but it\u2019s a loose ball from O\u2019Connor. He had half a hole but couldn\u2019t find a runner around him. Beale tells his backline to calm down. A lot still to run in this Test. What a cracking Bledisloe! Here we go! One of the few times Aaron Smith has had ball in hand and the opportunity to hit the line, eyes up. And he picks out his fullback, who steams in on a clever line. Too much for Hooper - he crashes through a half-hole. Mo\u2019unga adds the extras from near in front. We\u2019re back within one converted try! 53 min: Back underway and it\u2019s a rare moment of ball-in-hand for the All Blacks (when would you ever imagine typing that). Coles propes out wide, they build 15 phases, the All Blacks. Read picks and gos. Mo\u2019unga looks to dance through. Smith tries to dance inside, but this is good defence from Australia. Pat McCarthy joins to chat while we\u2019re in the injury break: Hi Richard. I think a big question for Hansen is who will be his starting 2, 8, 9, 10 and 15. It is still up in the air. Not to mind his centres. Compared to 2015, that 2, 8, 9, 10 and 15 spine was fairly set in stone + McCaw/Nonu and C.Smith. I think his commitment to having SBW in the squad reflects his nervousness. 6 weeks to make up his mind! It\u2019s a fair point, Pat. We\u2019ve seen a bit of chop and change from Hansen lately. Is it fine-tuning, or as you say, uncertainty? 50 min: A slight break in play with an injury concern for Rory Arnold. A chance for the All Blacks to take stock. Nobody would ever dare to write them off, but a big thirty minutes ahead - especially with the man disadvantage. They\u2019re getting through a power of work defensively. Even All Blacks tire though, right? 48 min: The All Blacks hit twice in quick succession after going behind, and now so too have the Wallabies! It\u2019s terrific work from Samu Kerevi he\u2019s brushed off two would-be tacklers, first Smith, than Barrett - that was Lomu-esque! He powers towards the line, and it\u2019s the half-back White backing up inside who gets a deserving try! Watch that bounce from Kerevi on Beauden Barrett. Wow. Unbelievable stuff. Champagne rugby! No extras from Lealiifano. That one\u2019s hooked too far. Tricky attempts from the sideline, let\u2019s hope those don\u2019t prove costly. What a start! It\u2019s a try made on the back row - lock to lock, and you can\u2019t stop the tall timbers at that distance! A first ever try for Salakaia-Loto after good hands from Rory Arnold. Lealiifano with a fine curling effort from the sideline, it comes round - and it\u2019s bounced off the upright! Unlucky! 45 min: Australia again on the attack, they build to 10 phases again, but the All Blacks appear to be defending well. But wait a second, wait a second.. David Manser has joined the conversation from Bern, Switzerland - thanks for the email: Re: the red card - Absolutely correct decision by the ref. Intent has no place if we\u2019re serious about player welfare. The best teams will adapt if this rule is applied consistently. I think it\u2019s great to see the Aussies looking like they might be finally waking up after a torrid few years: Rugby is a better game when there are more than one team competing for the top spot. Agree David, on both fronts. Questions remain though on whether some referees are more inclined to adhere to the strict letter of the law than others though. 42 min: We go upstairs - has Latu crashed over! There\u2019s no conclusive angle, but it look likes Dane Coles has done an unbelievable job of getting under his opposite hooker. Terrific defence, Australia restart with a 5m scrum. 40 min: No rest for the wicked (well, except Scott Barrett) - we\u2019re back! Australia with ball in hand - can they make the most of their one-man advantage in this second half? Big test for the ABs. They\u2019ve done it before, but they\u2019ll need to dig deep in defence. So! Your thoughts on that opening stanza? The talking point will of course be the sending off. To the letter of the law, it\u2019s possibly the correct decision - but was that still harsh on Scott Barrett? It didn\u2019t look especially malicious, but that doesn\u2019t matter if direct force to the head and neck is the issue at hand. A shame almost to overshadow the rest of that fascinating first stanza. Your thoughts on the All Blacks\u2019 opening play? Are they lacking a little cohesion? Or have the Wallabies simply played out of their socks? Drop me a line - let us know your thoughts. Lealiifano kicks the penalty from in front of the sticks, and that\u2019s the half-time whistle! A dramatic end to a pulsating first 40. They\u2019ve been treated to something here already, the people of Perth. What a big 40 minutes we have ahead of us! Wow. It didn\u2019t look too much on first impressions, but it is direct contact to the neck and the head of the Australian captain by the Kiwi second rower. He\u2019s tried to duck into the tackle, but he\u2019s a big man and he\u2019s caught the skipper high. Big call - the All Blacks will be down to 14 for the duration of the match! 39 min: Australia look to drive from the line out, they\u2019re about 5m out. A wall of black meets them once again. Koroibete is involved trying a pick-and-go. Brave from the winger, the big men monster him. Hooper\u2019s again involved in something. Has he copped a shoulder charge? We go to a TMO, but they were only 5m out, Australia! 38 min: A bit of bad blood. Savea penalised for whacking Hooper in the back of the head while the Wallabies skipper was prone. If you\u2019re a betting man you\u2019d imagine there was something that proceeded that, but it\u2019s the Australians who get the benefit on this occasion. Some out of character ill-discipline from the ABs No 6. 35 min: No! Great defence Australia, and they emerge with the ball, and the ABs get nothing from the good opportunity. Australia build the phases - nothing flash, just solid metres up the guts. White with a clever box kick and Ioane almost makes a meal of it! The winger slips at a critical moment, and for a half second it looked like Koroibete could have been in! Hearts-in-mouth stuff - but the former world player of the year grounds ahead of his opposite winger in goal. Australia to attack again. 32 min: Latu hits Arnold and the Wallabies look to spread, but it\u2019s an error. Rodda pinged for an infringement in the cleanout and the AB\u2019s are let off once again. Sloppy play from the second rower. We go upfield and it\u2019s another penalty - on O\u2019Connor for not rolling away. The ABs go to touch, instead of taking the three. Could this hurt the Wallabies, just before HT? 30 min: We reset for another scrum, White sets to feed, but it\u2019s a penalty against the ABs, Moody collapses, and Hodge looks to boom one of his trademark 50m bombs for touch. Latu with a key lineout 22m out. 28 min: Barrett kicks off and they pick out Hooper once again - it appears a strategy to target the diminutive forward (at least in height). Ooph. It\u2019s a rotten pass from Lealiifano, but it was a ball put down by Cane first after a big hit from Alaalatoa. Scrum to Australia 10m inside their own half. 26 min: Lealiifano faces down the boo-boys once again - is this a home game, or are we at Eden Park?! He strikes it sweetly, and they\u2019re back in front again, Australia. Just. 23 min: Wallabies probing once again, as they look to build the phases just outside the ABs line. They hit 10 phases before spreading wide. Kerevi charges to the line but Mo\u2019unga pulls him down. Beale charges at the line, but is mowed down and ball goes to ground. We come back for a penalty for offside. Great defence NZ, what a period of pressure from Australia! 20 min: So after that promising start from the Wallabies, they\u2019re right back behind the eight-ball with a quick double salvo from the All Blacks. How often have we seen this in world rugby?! Classic counterpunch from the world No 1 side, who in fairness haven\u2019t been at their best in the first quarter. A small break in play, and both sides suck in the big breaths. Goodhue leaves the field with injury btw, with Laumape into the fray. 15 min: ABs with ball in hand and Barrett fires it deep to Beale. Australia counterpunch and almost find a way through with Hodge. Oh my. The ABs are straight back in! There\u2019s some controversy on this, Smith with a pass to Ioane that looked forward, and was the winger offside anyway? No checks from upstairs. It all came from a bust from Dane Coles following an Australian turnover. Terrific run from the front rower who capitalised on the broken play. Nic White is furious, he thought that final pass was a mile forward! Mo\u2019unga hooks wide, no conversion. 13 min: Read isn\u2019t offside, he doesn\u2019t infringe Hooper, and Lienert-Brown does ground cleanly. It\u2019s a try! Fine work from Goodhue, but what a scrappy chain of events, albeit off a clever improvised kick back inside. The extras added without error from the boot. They hit back, and right away, the All Blacks! Game on. 12 min: New Zealand now with a first look with ball in hand. They go wide to Goodhue, who kicks back inside. It\u2019s a footrace for the skippers, Read v Hooper, and the veteran is making good yards! Is he pulled down? Is Hooper infringed? It\u2019s a mad scramble, nobody can bat it dead, but does Lienert-Brown eventually ground it? We go upstairs to check! 10 min: It\u2019s smart hands out wide, and that combination - O\u2019Connor to Hodge - has done the damage! They go quickly wide, twice, the Wallabies, the ball goes to ground, but O\u2019Connor recovers, draws the defence, and his winger goes 49m and land one under the posts. Lealiifano adds the extras. Hello! It\u2019s the Wallabies out by ten. 9 min: Australia on the attack, and it\u2019s Kerevi who busts the line once again, but he can\u2019t find Hooper on the outside and it\u2019s a turnover about 25m out from the ABs line. NZ kick clear and it\u2019s Australia on the 50m line. 6 min: Fair Kiwi contingent in the crowd as Lealiifano receives the boos, but he nails the kick - early points, and a fair reward for that bright start. A high tackle on Hooper from the restart - they\u2019re giving away far too many infringements early, NZ, Steve Hansen won\u2019t be pleased. 5 min: Great burst from Lealiifano, who breaks the line with a clever dummy! He finds O\u2019Connor outside him, but again it\u2019s Read who recovers well to mow down. He just couldn\u2019t find the support runners, the move caught even those in green &amp; gold napping, and it\u2019s a turnover. Great momentum, Australia. 3 min: Wallabies building the phases, they\u2019re probing, but it\u2019s a relieving penalty! Terrific work from the skipper Read who stays over the ball and is cleared out illegally. ABs get clear of their line, Australia have the change to attack again, but from deeper in the field. 1 min: The All Blacks kick off and it\u2019s skipper Hooper with the first catch. Penalty against the ABs with Goodhue coming in from an offside position! Reece Hodge bombs upfield and Koroibete puts Smith under pressure at the back with a chip and chase. Lienert-Brown tries to round the chasers, but he\u2019s bundled into touch 22m out from NZ\u2019s line! Good start, Wallabies. Haka-time! What will Hooper\u2019s men do. The line and face? The slow walk towards? The huddle and cry? (It\u2019s B) TJ Perenara fires the ABs. Good griefing lord, is there a more impressive sight in world sport than this? Kieran Reed at the apex of the formation, Dane Coles - back in the fold after so long out with an impassioned rendition. Wow. Spine tingles. And impeccably observed by this huge crowd. A lot of focus on this man for Australia. He\u2019s back on home soil where he (Reece Hodge and many others) enjoyed great success for the Western Force. Can that continue form translate into the Green and Gold? So our two teams are out on the pitch. There\u2019s a lovely Welcome to Country from local Noongar elders - which means we\u2019re not far away from anthems, and of course: the haka. (Spine tingles in anticipation). So - just how much of a mismatch is recent history between these two nations? The overall Bledisloe record reads 43-114 in favour of New Zealand, but it\u2019s marginally better reading on Australian soil: 26-51. Over the last decade though it\u2019s the ABs who have had the wood on their opponents. They\u2019ve been No 1 in world rugby for 400+ weeks and that\u2019s shown out against their Trans-Tasman rivals: 25 wins, 2 draws, 4 losses over the past decade. Michael Hooper and friends will be looking to make it five. They are undefeated in Perth in six Tests though. Let\u2019s see. We are of course over in the West today, at the impressive Optus Stadium, where there\u2019s an expected 60-65,000 sellout crowd in attendance. A new venue for Bledisloe - can it bring the Wallabies good luck? My spies at the ground tell me there\u2019s a pretty significant Kiwi contingent in attendance - no doubt they\u2019ll be vocal as well. So, we\u2019re not a million miles away from kick-off, so let\u2019s get on to team news: A few big (crazy-brave?) calls from Michael Cheika who\u2019s given Australia Rugby\u2019s one-time enfant terrible, James O\u2019Connor a first start after a six-year absence, with Nic White preferred to start in the halves ahead of Will Genia. Tongan Thor and Adam Coleman will give much-needed energy from the bench but the continued absence of David Pocock will be sorely missed at the back of the eight. Australia: 15 Kurtley Beale, 14 Reece Hodge, 13 James O\u2019Connor, 12 Samu Kerevi, 11 Marika Koroibete, 10 Christian Lealiifano, 9 Nic White, 8 Isi Naisarani, 7 Michael Hooper (c), 6 Lukhan Salakaia-Loto, 5 Rory Arnold, 4 Izack Rodda, 3 Allan Alaalatoa, 2 Tolu Latu, 1 Scott Sio. Bench: 16 Folau Fainga\u2019a, 17 James Slipper, 18 Taniela Tupou, 19 Adam Coleman, 20 Luke Jones, 21 Will Genia, 22 Matt Toomua, 23 Tom Banks. It\u2019s near full strength from Steve Hansen, who continues with Mo\u2019unga at 10, and Beaudie Barrett at fullback. No Brodie Retallick is about the only bright point for Australian fans - but Scott Barrett who comes in is definitely no slouch. But it\u2019s Ardie Savea - one of the form players in world rugby right now - who looms as a real danger man. Apart from the other 14 in black, that is. New Zealand: 15 Beauden Barrett, 14 Ben Smith, 13 Jack Goodhue, 12 Anton Lienert-Brown, 11 Rieko Ioane, 10 Richie Mo\u2019unga, 9 Aaron Smith, 8 Kieran Read (captain), 7 Sam Cane, 6 Ardie Savea, 5 Sam Whitelock, 4 Scott Barrett, 3 Owen Franks, 2 Dane Coles, 1 Joe Moody. Bench: 16 Codie Taylor, 17 Atu Moli, 18 Angus Ta\u2019avao, 19 Patrick Tuipulotu, 20 Matt Todd, 21 TJ Perenara, 22 Ngani Laumape, 23 George Bridge. As mentioned there is the minor matter of the Rugby World Cup coming up in Japan, which does mean what is usually the key event of the Southern hemisphere rugby calendar - the Bledisloe - is a little overlooked this year. Does this create a glimmer of hope for the Wallabies - to catch the ABs with their eyes on a bigger prize? Bret Harris has some interesting musings on the topic: The last thing the Bledisloe Cup needs right now is an attack on its credibility by its own participants seeking greater glory. The World Cup is the priority, but do the All Blacks and the Wallabies really have to diminish 88 years of Bledisloe history and tradition in their bid to lift the Webb Ellis Cup? Kia ora! Hi! Welcome to thee and thine from wherever you\u2019re following Guardian Australia\u2019s coverage of the Bledisloe Cup. Are you on secondment on the Chatham Islands, cursing yourself for your patchy 2 Degrees coverage? Are you crossing the Nullarbor with the laptop out the window? Or are you lost in the Shetlands, just a curious lover of rugby union keeping tabs on rival form ahead of the World Cup? Drop us an email or tweet to join the coverage today - we\u2019d love to hear your predictions: especially where the ABs are vulnerable or where Australia could find joy. 5,837 days. It sounds like something from of prison diary but that\u2019s how long Australia has waited to have the Bledisloe Cup back in its warm embrace. One of the great rivalries of world sport, Australia v New Zealand in rugby union was once the very pinnacle of the game. Until the All Blacks etched their name as one of the all-time great teams, sweeping the world for nigh on a decade, and beating Australia for 15 consecutive Trans-Tasman contests. Curiously, that\u2019s not even NZ\u2019s longest run of supremacy - that was from 1951-78 (although it wasn\u2019t an annual tournament, so only encompassed 12 campaigns). Can Australia takes steps to ending the rot today, in the first of a World-Cup abridged two-game series? Absolutely not. The All Blacks winning 16-straight is as sure a thing as Winx backed a 1.01. But, for the good of the spectacle we as Australians will dare to dream. (At least until the 60th minute when the ABs bench proves too strong). So descale your kettle, plump the cushions and strap in for an inevitable 10-15 minute period of false hope!",

It comes a week after RBS\u2019 last board meeting, where the selection process \u2013 led by chairman Howard Davies \u2013 would have been discussed.

None of RBS\u2019s main rivals, including Barclays, HSBC and Lloyds Banking Group, have ever appointed a woman for any of the top three boardroom positions in the male-dominated industry.

Her leadership will come at a turning point for the bank, which is still trying to repair its reputation following a string of scandals and its \u00a345bn bailout at the height of the financial crisis in 2008. Over the past decade, RBS has been plagued by claims it mis-sold toxic mortgage-backed securities at in the lead-up to the financial crash, and that it pushed small businesses towards failure in order to strip and sell their assets for profit.

Lagan thought he could use his contacts to stymie some attacks.</p> <p>It was not straightforward: in the book Bradley claims Lagan told him that RUC special branch knew about some upcoming IRA operations but let some go ahead \u2013 probably because it would protect informers inside the Provisional\u2019s Derry Brigade. Nonetheless, Bradley says, he and Lagan together sent messages to the IRA leadership in the city that halted a number of attacks. He refuses to specify which IRA operations he and Lagan allegedly helped stop.</p> <p>\u201cI also was aware through him [Lagan] of the difficulty with Special Branch because he was informing me quite often of how difficult it was. He used me on a number of occasions to get things stopped because special branch would have let it go ahead and people would have ended up dead,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Bradley went on to become vice-chairman of the Northern Ireland Policing Board in the early 2000s. Lagan was the RUC\u2019s chief superintendent in Derry at the time of the Bloody Sunday march in 1972.</p> <p>He proposed marchers be allowed through to their planned destination in Derry\u2019s city centre, and later argued the violence which left 13 unarmed civilian protesters dead \u2013 could have been \u201crelatively contained\u201d if that had happened. Through his link with Bradley, Lagan was given assurances from the Provisional and Official IRA that there would be no guns at the protest. Lagan <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/news/policeman-who-tried-to-contain-bloody-sunday-1.457656\" title=\"\">died in 2005</a> aged 88.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 12 August 2019 to correct the year of Lagan\u2019s death.</p>",

The so-called Derry Link \u2013 which connected the British government with the Provisionals\u2019 leadership via a former priest \u2013 eventually led to the IRA\u2019s cessation of violence a year later. At the time the revelation of a clandestine nexus was sensational. But a new book on the outbreak of the Troubles 50 years ago this month shows that it had in fact existed long before, and had been used to stop specific IRA attacks even during the very earliest years of the conflict. Denis Bradley, a cleric who more than 20 years later organised covert talks between McGuinness and MI6 officers, passed on advice from Derry\u2019s chief police officer that the Provisionals should call off certain shootings and bombings in the early 1970s, according to the book. In Fifty Years On by the Belfast journalist and author Malachi O\u2019Doherty, Bradley says he and a Royal Ulster Constabulary veteran, Frank Lagan, convinced the local IRA to cancel some operations as they knew they had been compromised in advance by special branch via its informers. Reflecting on his relationship with Lagan, Bradley says: \u201cHe and I became fairly, well, \u2018close\u2019 \u2013 a strange word because Lagan was a very tall, austere human being, not the kind of guy you could have a close emotional contact with, but I was very trusting of him and he was trusting of me.\u201d Bradley, who was ordained in 1970 but gave up the priesthood at the end of that decade, was also trusted by McGuinness, then a rising star in the emerging Provisional IRA in Derry and beyondT who went on to become Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s chief negotiator in the peace process. Lagan thought he could use his contacts to stymie some attacks. It was not straightforward: in the book Bradley claims Lagan told him that RUC special branch knew about some upcoming IRA operations but let some go ahead \u2013 probably because it would protect informers inside the Provisional\u2019s Derry Brigade. Nonetheless, Bradley says, he and Lagan together sent messages to the IRA leadership in the city that halted a number of attacks. He refuses to specify which IRA operations he and Lagan allegedly helped stop. \u201cI also was aware through him [Lagan] of the difficulty with Special Branch because he was informing me quite often of how difficult it was. He used me on a number of occasions to get things stopped because special branch would have let it go ahead and people would have ended up dead,\u201d he says. Bradley went on to become vice-chairman of the Northern Ireland Policing Board in the early 2000s. Lagan was the RUC\u2019s chief superintendent in Derry at the time of the Bloody Sunday march in 1972. He proposed marchers be allowed through to their planned destination in Derry\u2019s city centre, and later argued the violence which left 13 unarmed civilian protesters dead \u2013 could have been \u201crelatively contained\u201d if that had happened. Through his link with Bradley, Lagan was given assurances from the Provisional and Official IRA that there would be no guns at the protest. Lagan died in 2005 aged 88. \u2022 This article was amended on 12 August 2019 to correct the year of Lagan\u2019s death.",

      "body": "<p>Jamie Chadwick is, at 21, quick, compelling to watch and no stranger to winning. She already boasts an impressive racing CV and on Sunday afternoon is in every position to add to it by becoming the inaugural winner of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/18/w-series-female-formula-one-driver\" title=\"\">the all\u2011women W Series </a>championship in the final round at Brands Hatch. For Chadwick, though, this is just a step towards her ultimate goal. \u201cF1 is the dream of every young driver,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Earlier this year Chadwick was taken on by the Williams F1 team as part of their junior driver programme, which she says is the first proper step in fulfilling her ambition. \u201cBeing in amongst the team, you learn how they operate, how an F1 team works \u2026 It hits home to me that, if I do a good job and get to be where I need to be and there is an opportunity down the line, it makes that dream feel a lot more like reality.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/09/w-series-first-champion-women-formula-one-motor-sport\">W Series\u2019 first champion marks key step for women in motor racing | Giles Richards</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The W Series was created to promote women in motor sport. It does not require them to have any financial backing and the series meets all their costs. Its aim is to showcase and develop talent and ultimately, the organisers hope, to help enable a woman to race in F1.</p> <p>Chadwick is more than aware of some of the harsh realities of racing. \u201cMotor sport is filled with false hope,\u201d she says. \u201cYou might get a phone call from an F1 team. I had one and quite often they have massive price tags on them. The reason they want you involved is because they want the big cheque.\u201d</p> <p>In contrast the Williams deputy team principal, Claire Williams, went to the first W Series race at Hockenheim to see Chadwick first hand, before discussing a programme at the team with her, without requiring backing.</p> <p>Chadwick duly impressed. She put her car on pole superbly in treacherous wet conditions in Germany and went on to win, taking a lead in the six\u2011meeting championship she has not relinquished. She has two wins and three other podium finishes and enters the finale 13 points ahead of Beitske Visser of the Netherlands. Visser has to finish in the top three to have any chance of catching her and whatever she does will not be enough if the British driver finishes on the podium again.</p> <p>Chadwick, from Bath, already holds some impressive records, despite not starting racing until she was 13, late by modern standards. In 2015 she became the first woman \u2013 and youngest driver \u2013 to win the British GT championship. In doing so she won the Britcar 24 Hours at Silverstone, becoming at 17 the youngest winner of a 24-hour race. She then entered single-seaters with two seasons in British F3 and last year at Brands Hatch was the first woman to win a British F3 race. This year she became the first woman to win the MRF Challenge Formula 2000 championship.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6965ad4806a5d7f3721389cc5fcd588c2ca44b34\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6965ad4806a5d7f3721389cc5fcd588c2ca44b34/684_555_3839_2304/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jamie Chadwick leading the field during first race of the W Series at Hockenheim in May\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jamie Chadwick leading the field during first race of the W Series at Hockenheim in May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthias Hangst/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The W Series, however, was an entirely new proposition. The 20 drivers, all racing the same, single\u2011seater F3 cars, swap vehicles and engineers at every race and share all their data. They all speak of the friendly, collegiate atmosphere and sense of purpose it brings. \u201cIt\u2019s bizarre, like being back at boarding school,\u201d says Chadwick. \u201cIt\u2019s like nothing else I have experienced and a pleasant surprise.</p> <p>\u201cRacing drivers are often isolated. You go about your junior career as an individual. You are never amongst other drivers 24-7. Here you are all together, you race each other, then you go to the hotel and have dinner together. When you have 20 like-minded female drivers, naturally you are going to get on. It is intense in a positive way, socially intense, mentally intense.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/02/jamie-chadwick-british-teen-hoping-first-female-f1\">Jamie Chadwick: British teen hoping to be first female F1 driver in 40 years</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Chadwick has collected acclaim throughout her career. She drove for Aston Martin in British GT and their three-times Le Mans-winning works driver Darren Turner described her as having \u201ca natural, smooth driving style and a good understanding of what makes a car work and how to make it go fast\u201d.</p> <p>Williams recognised similar strengths. \u201cJamie was the obvious candidate,\u201d she says. \u201cShe is doing a great job in W Series, great attitude, approach and drive. She is part of the academy, so we can support her path into the higher echelons of motor sport whatever that will be. It\u2019s early days, she has a good pedigree behind her but she has a lot of work to do. F1 is a long way off. She has to put the work in to get there. I think she has some great talent.\u201d</p> <p>The champion will take away $500,000 yet beyond the money and glory of taking the title there is a genuine sense that the W Series has already made a difference. Chadwick, who was initially sceptical of the concept, believes the selection process showed the right intent. Fifty-five drivers were evaluated at the Melk circuit in Austria, where they were tested not in F3 machinery but road cars.</p> <p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t do it in an F3 car because that would be an advantage to those that had driven in F3,\u201d she says. \u201cThey made it clear they were just trying to find natural talent.

      "bodyText": "Jamie Chadwick is, at 21, quick, compelling to watch and no stranger to winning. She already boasts an impressive racing CV and on Sunday afternoon is in every position to add to it by becoming the inaugural winner of the all\u2011women W Series championship in the final round at Brands Hatch. For Chadwick, though, this is just a step towards her ultimate goal. \u201cF1 is the dream of every young driver,\u201d she says. Earlier this year Chadwick was taken on by the Williams F1 team as part of their junior driver programme, which she says is the first proper step in fulfilling her ambition. \u201cBeing in amongst the team, you learn how they operate, how an F1 team works \u2026 It hits home to me that, if I do a good job and get to be where I need to be and there is an opportunity down the line, it makes that dream feel a lot more like reality.\u201d The W Series was created to promote women in motor sport. It does not require them to have any financial backing and the series meets all their costs. Its aim is to showcase and develop talent and ultimately, the organisers hope, to help enable a woman to race in F1. Chadwick is more than aware of some of the harsh realities of racing. \u201cMotor sport is filled with false hope,\u201d she says. \u201cYou might get a phone call from an F1 team. I had one and quite often they have massive price tags on them. The reason they want you involved is because they want the big cheque.\u201d In contrast the Williams deputy team principal, Claire Williams, went to the first W Series race at Hockenheim to see Chadwick first hand, before discussing a programme at the team with her, without requiring backing. Chadwick duly impressed. She put her car on pole superbly in treacherous wet conditions in Germany and went on to win, taking a lead in the six\u2011meeting championship she has not relinquished. She has two wins and three other podium finishes and enters the finale 13 points ahead of Beitske Visser of the Netherlands. Visser has to finish in the top three to have any chance of catching her and whatever she does will not be enough if the British driver finishes on the podium again. Chadwick, from Bath, already holds some impressive records, despite not starting racing until she was 13, late by modern standards. In 2015 she became the first woman \u2013 and youngest driver \u2013 to win the British GT championship. In doing so she won the Britcar 24 Hours at Silverstone, becoming at 17 the youngest winner of a 24-hour race. She then entered single-seaters with two seasons in British F3 and last year at Brands Hatch was the first woman to win a British F3 race. This year she became the first woman to win the MRF Challenge Formula 2000 championship. The W Series, however, was an entirely new proposition. The 20 drivers, all racing the same, single\u2011seater F3 cars, swap vehicles and engineers at every race and share all their data. They all speak of the friendly, collegiate atmosphere and sense of purpose it brings. \u201cIt\u2019s bizarre, like being back at boarding school,\u201d says Chadwick. \u201cIt\u2019s like nothing else I have experienced and a pleasant surprise. \u201cRacing drivers are often isolated. You go about your junior career as an individual. You are never amongst other drivers 24-7. Here you are all together, you race each other, then you go to the hotel and have dinner together. When you have 20 like-minded female drivers, naturally you are going to get on. It is intense in a positive way, socially intense, mentally intense.\u201d Chadwick has collected acclaim throughout her career. She drove for Aston Martin in British GT and their three-times Le Mans-winning works driver Darren Turner described her as having \u201ca natural, smooth driving style and a good understanding of what makes a car work and how to make it go fast\u201d. Williams recognised similar strengths. \u201cJamie was the obvious candidate,\u201d she says. \u201cShe is doing a great job in W Series, great attitude, approach and drive. She is part of the academy, so we can support her path into the higher echelons of motor sport whatever that will be. It\u2019s early days, she has a good pedigree behind her but she has a lot of work to do. F1 is a long way off. She has to put the work in to get there. I think she has some great talent.\u201d The champion will take away $500,000 yet beyond the money and glory of taking the title there is a genuine sense that the W Series has already made a difference. Chadwick, who was initially sceptical of the concept, believes the selection process showed the right intent. Fifty-five drivers were evaluated at the Melk circuit in Austria, where they were tested not in F3 machinery but road cars. \u201cThey didn\u2019t do it in an F3 car because that would be an advantage to those that had driven in F3,\u201d she says. \u201cThey made it clear they were just trying to find natural talent. That stood out for me. They were just going for the right people.\u201d Those selected included older drivers such as Britain\u2019s Alice Powell, whose career had all but ended due to a lack of funding and who has described racing as \u201ca billionaire boys\u2019 club\u201d. She proved she should be in a car, standing fourth in the championship. Others have prospered, too. \u201cFabienne Wohlwend is going full-time next season thanks to the attention she has received,\u201d Chadwick says. \u201cMarta Garc\u00eda had already written off her career at 17 and she\u2019s had a second chance. We are looking at a lot of girls that are coming into it after a few years out but hopefully also now, as it goes on, we will see more girls aspire to get into the sport because of this.\u201d Formula One has not had a female driver in a championship race since Lella Lombardi at the Austrian Grand Prix in 1976. It seems hard to imagine that when one finally returns she will not have at some point been on the W Series grid.

The <a href=\"https://bulawayo24.com/index-id-news-sc-national-byo-151246.html\" title=\"\">taste for luxury cars</a> among the very wealthy has led to a new genre of social media posts featuring the vehicles driven by MPs, well-connected businessmen and top officials on Harare\u2019s potholed streets.

They are collapsing in class because they are so weak. The teachers can\u2019t pay for their own children\u2019s education. But people are looting millions,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Mnangagwa and senior officials may have calculated that the recent austerity measures are relatively risk-free.

In January, 12 people died when security forces moved to crush unrest following a fuel price rise. Hundreds were arrested. Mutodi blamed the violence on \u201chooligans\u201d and the main opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change. He said the government had a duty to uphold the rule of law to show foreign investors that their businesses would be safe. Some diplomats in Harare say Zimbabwe\u2019s economic and diplomatic rehabilitation is more distant than ever, and Mnangagwa\u2019s repeated promises of reform are a deliberate smokescreen. \u201cWe\u2019ve revised our expectations \u2026 Now, we are looking at a difficult 10- to 15-year transition to something better, and that\u2019s the optimistic scenario,\u201d said one. Others believe the president is a pragmatist who has been thwarted by hardliners in the military and Zanu-PF. They point to incremental changes \u2013 a move towards allowing full foreign ownership of local businesses, visas for foreign journalists, a relatively free election last year and a new anti-graft commission \u2013 and say the \u201cwindow\u201d for Zimbabwe to end its pariah status is still open. \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that a party that has been in control for nearly 40 years is unwilling to take measures that could lead to it losing power and access to financial flows,\u201d one said. There are alternatives to the west and the big international lending institutions, and though these will never provide the funds necessary to refloat the economy and rebuild the country, they might inject enough cash to allow those who hold power to retain it. Powers such as Russia and China are wary, but there are resources to trade \u2013 platinum, gold, diamonds \u2013 which are attractive to unscrupulous outfits that thrive in similar environments across the continent. Some in Zimbabwe continue to make considerable sums of money. The taste for luxury cars among the very wealthy has led to a new genre of social media posts featuring the vehicles driven by MPs, well-connected businessmen and top officials on Harare\u2019s potholed streets. In the city\u2019s wealthy districts, restaurants are still busy and shops offer the latest iPhone. Outside Harare, by far the largest city, circumstances are different. Expectations of reform are lower, humanitarian need is greater. The United Nations says more than five million people, almost a third of the population and almost entirely in rural areas \u2013 will be in need of food aid. \u201cThis year we have more hungry Zimbabweans than ever before,\u201d said Eddie Rowie, the World Food Programme\u2019s country director. Obert Masaraure, the leader of a union that represents rural teachers, said his 30,000 members had been reduced to \u201cpaupers\u201d. \u201cThe learners are walking to school on empty stomachs. They are collapsing in class because they are so weak. The teachers can\u2019t pay for their own children\u2019s education. But people are looting millions,\u201d he said. Mnangagwa and senior officials may have calculated that the recent austerity measures are relatively risk-free. However much anger and despair there might be, there will be no general election for many years, and the opposition is divided. Protests are planned but few urban Zimbabweans are willing to risk their lives on the streets, and in rural areas the ruling party can use its control of vital seed and fertiliser supplies to quell any unrest. Four-fifths of the economy is informal, with an increasing proportion of transactions depending on barter. Remittances from the vast Zimbabwean diaspora provide a safety net for many \u2013 but not all. In Mbare, few see any significant chance of improvement soon. \u201cSome day maybe things will get better,\u201d said Mkhomo. \u201cBut not now, I don\u2019t think.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>At its outset, in 2007, <a href=\"https://www.arcolatheatre.com/grimeborn/\" title=\"\">Grimeborn</a>\u2019s punning name warned of a challenge to operatic safety and a blunt one at that.

Or was it essentially a form of operatic class war?</p> <p>So much has changed on the opera scene since Grimeborn began that it\u2019s hard to think these questions needed asking. It\u2019s vital that they were, and continue to be addressed by this and other plucky, small-scale outfits, too many to list. This month alone, <a href=\"https://www.tete-a-tete.org.uk/\" title=\"\">T\u00eate \u00e0 T\u00eate</a>, <a href=\"https://www.opera-in-the-city.com/\" title=\"\">Opera in the City</a>, <a href=\"https://www.fulhamopera.com/\" title=\"\">Fulham Opera</a> and <a href=\"http://www.northernoperagroup.co.uk/2019-opera-festival/4594592224\" title=\"\">Leeds Opera festival</a> are all hard at work. It\u2019s no longer a case of either or. Opera needs this mixed artistic economy to thrive. Grimeborn may now be an essential fixture, but it remains as bold and cage-rattling as ever, its ambitions capacious. Classics are transfigured, new works premiered, young artists given opportunities, older ones with experience welcomed to the fold. If you\u2019re sensing that this six-week event is a quixotic rattle bag for everyone, you\u2019ve grasped its ethos. The frustration, for me, is in being unable to go to all 16 shows.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Die Fledermaus was whisked into a nimble 50-minute snapshot of modern life</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.arcolatheatre.com/whats-on/das-rheingold/\" title=\"\">Das Rheingold</a></strong>, the first part of Wagner\u2019s Ring cycle, was an opening highlight. Jonathan Dove\u2019s pared down version, made in 1990 for City of Birmingham Touring Opera, manages to be an authentic sketch of the original, never mind the loss of orchestral amplitude. A total of 18 players in the pit \u2013 the excellent <a href=\"http://www.orpheusfoundation.com/about-orpheus/orpheus-sinfonia.html\" title=\"\">Orpheus Sinfonia</a> \u2013 may sound small, but it\u2019s a large number for the Arcola. The brass were hidden away in a gulley to the rear, an effect that worked, containing but not muffling their dark resonance. The voices easily soared over the ensemble, while the ear, ever beguiled by Dove\u2019s faithful ingenuity, quickly adjusted to the thin (but capable) body of strings.</p> <p>Many of the <em>Rheingold </em>team are already far along the Wagnerian road. The conductor, <a href=\"https://www.rcm.ac.uk/vocal/operaprofessors/details/?id=02259\" title=\"\">Peter Selwyn</a>, has worked on seven Ring cycles and assisted at Bayreuth. <a href=\"https://www.paulcareyjones.net/\" title=\"\">Paul Carey Jones</a>, bursting and rigid with cold self-regard, vocally magisterial as Wotan, a Wagner prize winner in 2013.

      "bodyText": "At its outset, in 2007, Grimeborn\u2019s punning name warned of a challenge to operatic safety and a blunt one at that. Who was this festival for? What was its aim? Would those susceptible to the bucolic lure of its assonant counterpart, Glyndebourne itself \u2013 high prices, world-class standards \u2013 also have the credentials to engage with this audacious newcomer, based at the Arcola, an old paint factory in east London? Or was it essentially a form of operatic class war? So much has changed on the opera scene since Grimeborn began that it\u2019s hard to think these questions needed asking. It\u2019s vital that they were, and continue to be addressed by this and other plucky, small-scale outfits, too many to list. This month alone, T\u00eate \u00e0 T\u00eate, Opera in the City, Fulham Opera and Leeds Opera festival are all hard at work. It\u2019s no longer a case of either or. Opera needs this mixed artistic economy to thrive. Grimeborn may now be an essential fixture, but it remains as bold and cage-rattling as ever, its ambitions capacious. Classics are transfigured, new works premiered, young artists given opportunities, older ones with experience welcomed to the fold. If you\u2019re sensing that this six-week event is a quixotic rattle bag for everyone, you\u2019ve grasped its ethos. The frustration, for me, is in being unable to go to all 16 shows. Das Rheingold, the first part of Wagner\u2019s Ring cycle, was an opening highlight. Jonathan Dove\u2019s pared down version, made in 1990 for City of Birmingham Touring Opera, manages to be an authentic sketch of the original, never mind the loss of orchestral amplitude. A total of 18 players in the pit \u2013 the excellent Orpheus Sinfonia \u2013 may sound small, but it\u2019s a large number for the Arcola. The brass were hidden away in a gulley to the rear, an effect that worked, containing but not muffling their dark resonance. The voices easily soared over the ensemble, while the ear, ever beguiled by Dove\u2019s faithful ingenuity, quickly adjusted to the thin (but capable) body of strings. Many of the Rheingold team are already far along the Wagnerian road. The conductor, Peter Selwyn, has worked on seven Ring cycles and assisted at Bayreuth. Paul Carey Jones, bursting and rigid with cold self-regard, vocally magisterial as Wotan, a Wagner prize winner in 2013. (Look out for his forthcoming Wotan at Longborough.) Claire Barnett-Jones (Fricka) and Harriet Williams (Erda) also have Wagner on their CVs. Seth Carico\u2019s mysteriously charming, rich-voiced Alberich, Kiandra Howarth\u2019s impassioned Freia/Woglinde and Gareth Brynmor John\u2019s pretty boy Donner all stood out. Julia Burbach\u2019s production \u2013 following a top-class Rape of Lucretia here last year \u2013 consisted of precarious piles of cardboard boxes and bags of polystyrene \u201cgold\u201d, in Bettina John\u2019s sets. Basic, yes, but it told the story effectively, spelling out loud and clear the folly that comes with greed. Between now and 7 September at Grimeborn, you can see works as varied as Bushra El-Turk\u2019s new opera Silk Moth, Rameau\u2019s Hippolyte et Aricie, Scott Joplin\u2019s Treemonisha and Amy Beach\u2019s Cabildo. With that choice, I wouldn\u2019t automatically, schedule reasons aside, have opted for an arrangement of Johann Strauss II\u2019s Die Fledermaus, staged by Baseless Fabric Theatre.

Fair enough, it was said, no one really expected to beat Barcelona anyway, even Ferguson used to find that difficult and none of the versions of United since he stepped down have looked remotely capable of troubling the Spanish giants.

Solskj\u00e6r himself is still an untried manager, at best a rookie in terms of cracking the top of the Premier League. While almost anyone with a smile on his face would have been welcome as an antidote to the saturnine Mourinho, just as much went wrong for Solskj\u00e6r last season as went right. Should United start the new season as weakly as they finished the old one the manager\u2019s position will be under scrutiny from the word go, as will the performances of some of the big name players who appear to have been bound to the club by nothing more than improved contracts. Some of the other distractions at United include an unsatisfactory ownership model, a less than decisive leader in Ed Woodward, the embarrassing failure of Alexis S\u00e1nchez and the number of players \u2013 Anthony Martial, Jesse Lingard, Fred \u2013 who struggle to showcase their undoubted talent with the consistency a big club demands. All the while United remain the country\u2019s most newsworthy and talked about club, even if others are winning all the meaningful prizes, with ex-pros such as Paul Ince and Paul Scholes usually willing to offer a public commentary on where the team is going wrong. That is a long list for even the most experienced manager to sort out, and Solskj\u00e6r is clearly not that. Though he was able to make a crucial difference in the middle of last season \u2013 like Ilsa and Rick in Casablanca, he will always have Paris \u2013 the brutal truth of the matter is that Paris Saint-Germain are an only slightly better assortment of ill-fitting and overpaid individual talents than United themselves. When Solskj\u00e6r and his players came up against genuine class in the next round of the Champions League the gulf was there for all to see \u2013 United were beaten home and away by Barcelona and went out at the quarter-final stage without scoring a goal in two legs. Fair enough, it was said, no one really expected to beat Barcelona anyway, even Ferguson used to find that difficult and none of the versions of United since he stepped down have looked remotely capable of troubling the Spanish giants. Yet Liverpool managed it in the semi, even overcoming a three goal first-leg deficit. The inevitable conclusion is that if United are still a long way off Barcelona, they are even further from the standard being set at Liverpool, where arguably more than at City, teamwork and tactical awareness are being taken to new heights and ambition recognises no limits.",

On one of the sticky notes, someone has written \u201cNothing!!\u201d It would be reassuring for the executives who run the video site if that were true, although not many would agree that it is. Susan Wojcicki, YouTube\u2019s CEO, who is in town for a three-week tour of Europe, is one of the most impressive and powerful women in tech \u2013 and also one of the most beleaguered.</p> <p>We meet in one of the studios, where YouTubers with more than 10,000 subscribers can make videos, and sit on sofas in a set with a faux brick-wall backdrop, which gives a slightly unnerving sense of fake cosiness. Wojcicki (pronounced \u201cWo-jisky\u201d) seems friendly but businesslike; chatty, but is careful about what she says. There is a lot to talk about: sexism in tech, the power of social media, being a working parent of five \u2013 and especially the crises that have engulfed the company she runs, particularly this year.</p> <p>Last month, the Washington Post reported that the US Federal Trade Commission <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/07/19/ftc-approves-settlement-with-google-over-youtube-kids-privacy-violations/?utm_term=.bca5df9f2d1c\" title=\"\">had finalised a multimillion-dollar fine for YouTube\u2019s owner, Google</a>, after an investigation found that the site had been collecting the data of children under 13.

Why did it take so long? \u201cWe\u2019ve always had an anti-hate speech policy,\u201d says Wojcicki. \u201cYouTube has had community guidelines from the very beginning and a number of guidelines involving hate and [incitement to] violence. What we have found is that, with every policy we make, there is content that will become borderline, or will find ways to skirt around those policies. What we were doing was tightening [rules] we already had.\u201d</p> <p>Under the new rules, certain events \u2013 such as the Holocaust and the Parkland school shooting \u2013 are now protected, so users can\u2019t post videos denying they happened. \u201cWe also defined the language in a way that is more precise and more clear, so you could not use any protected group \u2026 to justify violence, exclusion, separation, discrimination.\u201d The company has targeted what it calls \u201cborderline\u201d content \u2013 videos that skirt dangerously close to violating its policies \u2013 she says, with the platform removing comments and not allowing the videos to appear in its recommended section, the central feature that drives views.</p> <p>But it\u2019s an uphill battle; every minute, more than 500 hours of video is uploaded. The company employs 10,000 human moderators \u2013 as well as computers \u2013 to sift through it all. Surely the clean-up task is too big for them to get a handle on it? \u201cI think we\u2019ve made tremendous progress,\u201d says Wojcicki. In the first quarter of 2019, they removed 8.3m videos, she says. \u201cThe machines get more and more sophisticated as we get better at identifying that content, which means we can find it faster than before. Over 75% of the content that we\u2019re removing with machines, we find and remove without even a single view.\u201d But is it really possible to delete enough? \u201cYes, I think it is,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the progress we\u2019ve made and I believe we will continue to make more progress.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a245afd183570b2144b3c9c911c67c6a9eaf8673\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a245afd183570b2144b3c9c911c67c6a9eaf8673/123_460_6424_8031/800.jpg\" alt=\"Susan Wojcicki\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018With every policy we make, there is content that will become borderline, or will find ways to skirt around those policies.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity McCabe/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wojcicki\u2019s target, when she became CEO in 2014, was to get people watching a billion hours\u2019 worth of video a day \u2013 <a href=\"https://youtube.googleblog.com/2017/02/you-know-whats-cool-billion-hours.html\" title=\"\">a target she met in 2016</a>. But critics say that YouTube\u2019s entire business model is based on increasing watch time, and that videos trading in outrage and extremism drive this by engaging people to stay on the site longer.</p> <p>Does she agree with that? \u201cNo, I don\u2019t agree,\u201d she says, with a tight smile. \u201cWe\u2019ve designed YouTube to be a platform that generates high-quality content and experiences, where people are learning, or laughing, discovering people like them. Philosophically, that\u2019s the sort of content we\u2019re leaning into. But also we are an advertising-supported platform, and advertisers do not want to run on content that is extremist or that leads to any kind of controversial societal behaviour.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The way that we think about it is: \u2018Is this content violating one of our policies?\u2019 If it has, we remove that content</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But the platform still benefits from claiming it has more than 2 billion active users \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/04/10/share-of-u-s-adults-using-social-media-including-facebook-is-mostly-unchanged-since-2018/\" title=\"\">73% of Americans use it</a>, according to the Pew Research Center, more than any other social media platform \u2013 even if many come to watch unsavoury and inflammatory content. Is that not a problem? She asks which type of videos, although it is inconceivable that she doesn\u2019t know what I mean. The \u201calt-right\u201d stuff, the Alex Jones stuff, I say. (I could have added the videos glorifying Isis, since removed, that led to an exodus of advertisers in 2017.)</p> <p>\u201cAlex Jones isn\u2019t on our platform,\u201d says Wojcicki, of the far-right conspiracy theorist who had nearly 2.5 million subscribers. But he was, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/06/apple-removes-podcasts-infowars-alex-jones\" title=\"\">until he was banned last year</a> (fans still upload his shows to the platform). \u201cBut he\u2019s not any more,\u201d she says. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to remember that news or news commentary [is] a very small percentage of the number of views we have. The vast majority of YouTube is a combination of influencers who are focused in areas like comedy, beauty, how-to, gaming.\u201d Music is another, she says. \u201cIf you look at some of the content you referenced, that is an extremely small part of the platform.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b178a38cb22cdb3403b4bac8980dc5f84a19c899\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b178a38cb22cdb3403b4bac8980dc5f84a19c899/134_270_5951_3572/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alex Jones\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The now-banned conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But hasn\u2019t it been dangerously influential? She pauses. \u201cLook, it\u2019s a very small percentage of our views, and the way that we think about it is: \u2018Is this content violating one of our policies? Has it violated anything in terms of hate, harassment?\u2019 If it has, we remove that content. We keep tightening and tightening the policies. We also get criticism, just to be clear, [about] where do you draw the lines of free speech and, if you draw it too tightly, are you removing voices of society that should be heard? We\u2019re trying to strike a balance of enabling a broad set of voices, but also making sure that those voices play by a set of rules that are healthy conversations for society.\u201d</p> <p>For all her careful, frustratingly corporate answers, Wojcicki is in an almost impossible position. Aside from the gargantuan task of trying to sift through the never-ending torrent of content, she has to contend with the fact that removing far-right commentators\u2019 videos turns them into free-speech martyrs. She also has to keep \u201ccreators\u201d, many of whom make a handsome living through the site, happy. I have no reason to disbelieve Wojcicki when she says \u201cresponsibility has been my number one priority\u201d. The question is whether it is a task beyond her \u2013 and whether Google will tolerate changes that result in lower profits.</p> <p>Wojcicki, 51, is the eldest of three sisters, all rooted in Silicon Valley: her youngest sister, Anne, is the founder of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jul/23/what-i-learned-from-home-dna-test-kits-are-they-accurate-or-worthwhile\" title=\"\">the genetic-testing company 23andMe</a> and was married to Google\u2019s co-founder Sergey Brin; their middle sister, Janet, is a professor. They are the daughters of a refugee \u2013 their grandfather was an opposition leader in Poland and their father Stanley fled when he was 11, smuggled aboard a Swedish coal tanker with his mother and brother. They went to the US, where he became a physicist and the chair of Stanford University\u2019s physics department. Their mother, Esther, is a renowned teacher. \u201cI think one of the most valuable aspects of our childhood was growing up on the Stanford campus,\u201d says Wojcicki. \u201cStanford has all of its faculty live in the same location, so I grew up where all of my neighbours were professors.\u201d One was the late <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Dantzig\" title=\"\">George Dantzig</a>, the celebrated mathematician. \u201cI didn\u2019t realise what he had done academically until I was at college \u2013 I had always just known him as the person who lived next door.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77b6a757984046140ccceb243b120026242dcc59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77b6a757984046140ccceb243b120026242dcc59/994_113_1462_1828/800.jpg\" alt=\"Wojcicki on stage presenting\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wojcicki on stage presenting.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Taylor Hill/FilmMagic for YouTube</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wojcicki was influenced by the passion she saw around her, she says: \u201cUniversity professors are generally people who care deeply about a topic.\u201d Was there overwhelming pressure to succeed, growing up alongside so many high-achievers? \u201cI didn\u2019t feel pressure in the way people normally define success, whether that\u2019s with fame or income,\u201d she says. \u201cUniversity professors are always taking a cut in income to do what they want to do; they\u2019re dedicated to their field. I suppose there was some pressure to do what was interesting, to find an area that was meaningful.\u201d</p> <p>As a child, she wanted to be an artist. She studied literature and history at Harvard, not the typical background of tech CEOs, although her business brain was apparent from an early age \u2013 she had a childhood hustle selling homemade spice ropes (plaited yarn threaded with spices) before picking up graduate degrees in business and economics. \u201cI decided to take my first computer science class when I was a senior in college. My whole childhood was about arts and being creative \u2013 I just loved to make and create things \u2013 and it was really only in my senior year that I realised computers and software enabled you to make content, and I saw the creative aspect of it. I had this view beforehand that it was a very boring topic.\u201d This is why she loves YouTube\u2019s creators, she says: \u201cThat interest is what still draws me to technology.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>How much sexism has she experienced? 'I\u2019ve been supported for the most part. But there are micro-aggressions'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>After college, Wojcicki worked in marketing for Intel. A mutual friend introduced her to Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who rented Wojcicki\u2019s garage, where they built their search engine, Google, soon expanding into three ground-floor bedrooms in her house (Wojcicki and her husband, strapped for cash, were pleased to have help with the mortgage).</p> <p>Wojcicki joined Google in 1999, as the company\u2019s 16th employee. \u201cEveryone said: \u2018Why are you joining another search engine? It\u2019s not going to be successful; there are already way too many search engines.\u2019 But I saw right away that Google was offering an ability to find information that was unparalleled.\u201d Still, it was a risk to join this small company. \u201cI was five months\u2019 pregnant, and I had just bought a house, and I had student loans,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cI think it gets back to who I am as a person \u2013 I saw the internet was coming, I saw it was going to be big, and I felt at home at Google because it reminded me of the mission of a lot of universities, which is to enable resources for people to learn, to self-empower by studying and [giving] access to information.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"273b7b8ebd5429f372cc5684d3bcef0ebaee1fc5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/273b7b8ebd5429f372cc5684d3bcef0ebaee1fc5/705_0_1600_2000/800.jpg\" alt=\"Wojcicki with her sisters, Anne, left, CEO of 23andMe, and Janet, a professor, centre.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wojcicki with her sisters, Anne, left, CEO of 23andMe, and Janet, a professor, centre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Taylor Hill/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She became Google\u2019s marketing manager, then a senior vice-president overseeing advertising, which is instrumental in driving the vast majority of its gigantic profits \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/25/google-alphabet-earnings-shares-q2\" title=\"\">$9.2</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/25/google-alphabet-earnings-shares-q2\" title=\"\">bn (\u00a37.6bn) in the latest quarter</a>. Wojcicki was in charge of Google\u2019s video platform in 2005 when she realised a startup, YouTube, was outperforming it. She advised Google to buy it \u2013 which it did, in 2006, for $1.7bn. (The billionaire investor Mark Cuban said at the time that <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/mark-cuban-only-a-moron-would-buy-youtube/\" title=\"\">\u201canyone who buys [YouTube] is a moron\u201d</a>, predicting that the site would be \u201csued into oblivion\u201d for hosting copyrighted content.) In 2014, she became its CEO, growing it into a business that is now worth about $160bn.</p> <p>Although Wojcicki is one of the most influential people in tech, she has maintained a low profile, but seems well-regarded in the industry as a steady and diligent leader. She has been vocal about <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kathleenchaykowski/2018/04/10/youtube-ceo-susan-wojcicki-three-ways-tech-companies-should-improve-diversity/\" title=\"\">the need to get more women into tech</a> and into leadership positions (Sheryl Sandberg, formerly at Google and now Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, has named Wojcicki as a role model). Under Wojcicki, the proportion of female staff at YouTube has increased from a quarter to a third, she says, \u201cand that includes our leadership\u201d.</p> <p>Why have so few women made it to her level? \u201cIf you look at the pipeline of women graduating with computer science degrees, it\u2019s a much smaller number [than men],\u201d she says. \u201cIn the US, about 20% are women. That just means that, when you get started, there is a smaller pool of women who have those capabilities. The challenge is getting that network started. It\u2019s always hard if you\u2019re the first woman, the only woman, but if you\u2019re working in an organisation where there are a significant number, and not just in the entry-level positions, then younger women understand that they can also achieve these leadership roles.\u201d</p> <p>One of the important factors in keeping women, says Wojcicki, is a generous maternity leave policy. Google offers six months\u2019 paid leave in the US, where there is no federal entitlement to any. \u201cTwenty-five per cent of American women come back to work after 10 days [of having a baby], which is a crazy number,\u201d she says. \u201cAfter I had my last child, I was thinking on day 10: \u2018How would I feel if I had to come back right now?\u2019 And I thought: \u2018I wouldn\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019d rather quit.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>How much sexism has she experienced in her career? \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been supported,\u201d she says, then pauses. \u201cFor the most part. But a lot of times there are micro-aggressions that people aren\u2019t always aware of and that can have a cumulative effect.\u201d Men have spoken over her, or not taken on board what she has said, or not taken her seriously. \u201cAnd so I think I\u2019ve also developed techniques, over 20 years of being in the industry, of learning how to have my words taken seriously, and how to get attention.\u201d</p> <p>Sometimes, she says, she will simply call it out. \u201cOr I\u2019ll find a way to get people to really listen. What I find is, you can\u2019t say comments in a timid, unsure way \u2013 no one\u2019s going to listen to you and no one\u2019s going to take you seriously. You have to be able to state your opinion in a way that is confident.\u201d Getting attention is important, too: \u201cSo, you have to say something like: \u2018No, I completely disagree with your point of view, you\u2019re going in the wrong direction. Let me tell you what I think is the right step for the future.\u2019 And then you\u2019ve opened the door and people are paying attention.\u201d Tech is getting more diverse, she says, which is vital for society. \u201cIt has become such an important force of change in so many parts of our economic landscape,\u201d she says. \u201cIf only 25% of people coming into tech are women, then there are some stories and some perspectives that are not being shared.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I have times when I take away all my kids\u2019 phones, especially if we\u2019re on a family vacation</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Wojcicki\u2019s children range in age from four to late teens. They do watch YouTube, she says (the dedicated kids\u2019 version for the younger ones). How do she and her husband, a Google executive, manage their children\u2019s screen time? \u201cIt\u2019s always important to have balance,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat is important to me is that kids learn how to manage technology responsibly. Just like you talk to your kids about what you do when you go out on the street, you need to have a conversation with them about safety on the internet, and also find a way to manage screen time and balance that with other activities.\u201d</p> <p>Are there arguments over screen time? \u201cI have times when I take away all my kids\u2019 phones, especially if we\u2019re on a family vacation, because I want people to interact with each other. So, I take away their phones and say: \u2018We\u2019re all going to focus on being present today.\u2019 It comes back to balance \u2013 people need to learn when it is a time [to be] focused in the conversation, and when it is OK to go and watch videos or do other activities on the internet.\u201d</p> <p>At what age did they get phones? \u201cWhen my kids started to be in a position when they were on their own, taking a bus or going places, it was useful for them to have a phone,\u201d she says. Once, her daughter got \u201cstuck somewhere and she didn\u2019t have any way to reach us. There are moments when it becomes important for them to have a phone. I think middle school [from about the age of 11] is a reasonable point to start educating them about it, but also a lot of times you can take it away. High school is harder \u2013 you\u2019re dealing with children who are getting close to going to college, and you have zero control when that happens.\u201d</p> <p>She doesn\u2019t like to manage their screen time too much, she says, preferring to let her children create \u201cself-control methods. TV was the same when I was growing up. I was taught that, sure, some TV is enjoyable, but it needs to be balanced with sports, school, homework, reading and other activities.\u201d</p> <p>Wojcicki is worth a reported $500m. Is it hard to maintain any kind of \u201cnormal\u201d life for her children? \u201cI work really hard to give my kids a normal life,\u201d she says. \u201cIn some ways, that\u2019s very manageable, because those are my values \u2013 hard work, doing something meaningful. I do talk to my kids about a lot of the challenges we face at work, because these are issues of society and it\u2019s interesting to hear their point of view. I work incredibly hard to make sure my children are hard-working, respectful and live balanced lives, and I try to set that example.\u201d</p> <p>A typical day involves getting up at 7am or 8am to do some exercise (\u201cI\u2019m not a morning person,\u201d she adds with a smile), taking the children to school and getting to work between 9am and 10am. Sometimes, she stops for lunch, but usually she has a lunch meeting. She tells me about her working style, using impenetrable phrases such as \u201cright processes\u201d, but adds: \u201cI\u2019m not a person who tries to micromanage.\u201d And she tries to get home for dinner.</p> <p>She sets a few rules for herself when she is at home. \u201cI do switch off, and I think that\u2019s incredibly important,\u201d she says. \u201cIf there\u2019s a crisis, then I understand I need to be there and I need to be on top of that situation, but my goal is to make sure we don\u2019t have crises. In general, I try to have evenings where I\u2019m not looking at my phone or doing email or work.\u201d That said, she does check her email at some point later on, because \u201cthings have usually happened in those couple of hours. I also try really hard to take a break on the weekend, and I try not to send emails to my team, because I want them to take a break. I\u2019m a believer that taking breaks leads to higher productivity in the end and more longevity.\u201d</p> <p>Does she have time for anything else? \u201cI like to garden,\u201d she says. \u201cI like animals.\u201d She has chickens and goats. \u201cI like to grow things. I love getting away by doing something completely different from technology, whether it\u2019s learning about bees and having honey, or learning about different types of chickens, or varieties of fruit.\u201d It sounds lovely, I say. She visibly relaxes and says: \u201cIt is.\u201d</p> <p>The day before we meet, the tech site Gizmodo publishes a piece on <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/youtube-said-it-was-getting-serious-about-hate-speech-1836596239\" title=\"\">how extremist channels remain on </a><a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/youtube-said-it-was-getting-serious-about-hate-speech-1836596239\" title=\"\">YouTube</a>, despite the new policies. In the face of fairly constant criticism, does Wojcicki ever feel like walking away? \u201cNo, I don\u2019t. Because I feel a commitment to solving these challenges,\u201d she says. \u201cI care about the legacy that we leave and about how history will view this point in time. Here\u2019s this new technology, we\u2019ve enabled all these new voices. What did we do? Did we decide to shut it down and say only a small set of people will have their voice? Who will decide that, and how will it be decided? Or do we find a way to enable all these different voices and perspectives, but find a way to manage the abuse of it? I\u2019m focused on making sure we can manage the challenges of having an open platform in a responsible way.\u201d</p> <p>Still, it is hard to resist picturing Wojcicki in her garden on a day off, attempting to nurture something beautiful while holding back the unstoppable force of weeds that just keep coming.</p> <p>\u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email <a href=\"mailto:\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

      "bodyText": "In YouTube\u2019s fashionable central London \u201cspace\u201d, where good-looking young people mill around and help themselves to the well-stocked free kitchen, there is a noticeboard that asks staff and visitors: What could we do better? On one of the sticky notes, someone has written \u201cNothing!!\u201d It would be reassuring for the executives who run the video site if that were true, although not many would agree that it is. Susan Wojcicki, YouTube\u2019s CEO, who is in town for a three-week tour of Europe, is one of the most impressive and powerful women in tech \u2013 and also one of the most beleaguered. We meet in one of the studios, where YouTubers with more than 10,000 subscribers can make videos, and sit on sofas in a set with a faux brick-wall backdrop, which gives a slightly unnerving sense of fake cosiness. Wojcicki (pronounced \u201cWo-jisky\u201d) seems friendly but businesslike; chatty, but is careful about what she says. There is a lot to talk about: sexism in tech, the power of social media, being a working parent of five \u2013 and especially the crises that have engulfed the company she runs, particularly this year. Last month, the Washington Post reported that the US Federal Trade Commission had finalised a multimillion-dollar fine for YouTube\u2019s owner, Google, after an investigation found that the site had been collecting the data of children under 13. In May, the Vox journalist Carlos Maza complained, in a tweet that went viral, that he had been the repeated victim of homophobic and racist abuse by one of YouTube\u2019s stars (or \u201ccreators\u201d, in company speak), the conservative commentator Steven Crowder. In an open letter, 145 employees of Google, YouTube and their parent company, Alphabet, called for San Francisco Pride to refuse Google\u2019s sponsorship because it had repeatedly ignored their calls to take more seriously what they viewed as hate speech on YouTube and other Google platforms. Before this, in March, YouTube was criticised for failing to act quickly enough to remove footage of the New Zealand mosque attacks, which had flooded the site. A month earlier, it was revealed that paedophiles had been using the comments section under videos of children to communicate with each other. The platform has hosted violent or sexually explicit videos made to look like content for children (such as Peppa Pig animations), while one of its biggest stars, Logan Paul, once posted a video in which he posed next to a man who had killed himself. Elsewhere on the site, conspiracy theories proliferate. Researchers claim it is a place where far-right commentators, white supremacists and men\u2019s rights activists have radicalised legions of young white men. Politicians are circling, concerned about how powerful tech companies have become and talking about breaking up the biggest. In June, YouTube announced new anti-hate speech policies in an attempt to address some of the concerns. Why did it take so long? \u201cWe\u2019ve always had an anti-hate speech policy,\u201d says Wojcicki. \u201cYouTube has had community guidelines from the very beginning and a number of guidelines involving hate and [incitement to] violence. What we have found is that, with every policy we make, there is content that will become borderline, or will find ways to skirt around those policies. What we were doing was tightening [rules] we already had.\u201d Under the new rules, certain events \u2013 such as the Holocaust and the Parkland school shooting \u2013 are now protected, so users can\u2019t post videos denying they happened. \u201cWe also defined the language in a way that is more precise and more clear, so you could not use any protected group \u2026 to justify violence, exclusion, separation, discrimination.\u201d The company has targeted what it calls \u201cborderline\u201d content \u2013 videos that skirt dangerously close to violating its policies \u2013 she says, with the platform removing comments and not allowing the videos to appear in its recommended section, the central feature that drives views. But it\u2019s an uphill battle; every minute, more than 500 hours of video is uploaded. The company employs 10,000 human moderators \u2013 as well as computers \u2013 to sift through it all. Surely the clean-up task is too big for them to get a handle on it? \u201cI think we\u2019ve made tremendous progress,\u201d says Wojcicki. In the first quarter of 2019, they removed 8.3m videos, she says. \u201cThe machines get more and more sophisticated as we get better at identifying that content, which means we can find it faster than before. Over 75% of the content that we\u2019re removing with machines, we find and remove without even a single view.\u201d But is it really possible to delete enough? \u201cYes, I think it is,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the progress we\u2019ve made and I believe we will continue to make more progress.\u201d Wojcicki\u2019s target, when she became CEO in 2014, was to get people watching a billion hours\u2019 worth of video a day \u2013 a target she met in 2016. But critics say that YouTube\u2019s entire business model is based on increasing watch time, and that videos trading in outrage and extremism drive this by engaging people to stay on the site longer. Does she agree with that? \u201cNo, I don\u2019t agree,\u201d she says, with a tight smile. \u201cWe\u2019ve designed YouTube to be a platform that generates high-quality content and experiences, where people are learning, or laughing, discovering people like them. Philosophically, that\u2019s the sort of content we\u2019re leaning into. But also we are an advertising-supported platform, and advertisers do not want to run on content that is extremist or that leads to any kind of controversial societal behaviour.\u201d But the platform still benefits from claiming it has more than 2 billion active users \u2013 73% of Americans use it, according to the Pew Research Center, more than any other social media platform \u2013 even if many come to watch unsavoury and inflammatory content. Is that not a problem? She asks which type of videos, although it is inconceivable that she doesn\u2019t know what I mean. The \u201calt-right\u201d stuff, the Alex Jones stuff, I say. (I could have added the videos glorifying Isis, since removed, that led to an exodus of advertisers in 2017.) \u201cAlex Jones isn\u2019t on our platform,\u201d says Wojcicki, of the far-right conspiracy theorist who had nearly 2.5 million subscribers. But he was, until he was banned last year (fans still upload his shows to the platform). \u201cBut he\u2019s not any more,\u201d she says. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to remember that news or news commentary [is] a very small percentage of the number of views we have. The vast majority of YouTube is a combination of influencers who are focused in areas like comedy, beauty, how-to, gaming.\u201d Music is another, she says. \u201cIf you look at some of the content you referenced, that is an extremely small part of the platform.\u201d But hasn\u2019t it been dangerously influential? She pauses. \u201cLook, it\u2019s a very small percentage of our views, and the way that we think about it is: \u2018Is this content violating one of our policies? Has it violated anything in terms of hate, harassment?\u2019 If it has, we remove that content. We keep tightening and tightening the policies. We also get criticism, just to be clear, [about] where do you draw the lines of free speech and, if you draw it too tightly, are you removing voices of society that should be heard? We\u2019re trying to strike a balance of enabling a broad set of voices, but also making sure that those voices play by a set of rules that are healthy conversations for society.\u201d For all her careful, frustratingly corporate answers, Wojcicki is in an almost impossible position. Aside from the gargantuan task of trying to sift through the never-ending torrent of content, she has to contend with the fact that removing far-right commentators\u2019 videos turns them into free-speech martyrs. She also has to keep \u201ccreators\u201d, many of whom make a handsome living through the site, happy. I have no reason to disbelieve Wojcicki when she says \u201cresponsibility has been my number one priority\u201d. The question is whether it is a task beyond her \u2013 and whether Google will tolerate changes that result in lower profits. Wojcicki, 51, is the eldest of three sisters, all rooted in Silicon Valley: her youngest sister, Anne, is the founder of the genetic-testing company 23andMe and was married to Google\u2019s co-founder Sergey Brin; their middle sister, Janet, is a professor. They are the daughters of a refugee \u2013 their grandfather was an opposition leader in Poland and their father Stanley fled when he was 11, smuggled aboard a Swedish coal tanker with his mother and brother. They went to the US, where he became a physicist and the chair of Stanford University\u2019s physics department. Their mother, Esther, is a renowned teacher. \u201cI think one of the most valuable aspects of our childhood was growing up on the Stanford campus,\u201d says Wojcicki. \u201cStanford has all of its faculty live in the same location, so I grew up where all of my neighbours were professors.\u201d One was the late George Dantzig, the celebrated mathematician. \u201cI didn\u2019t realise what he had done academically until I was at college \u2013 I had always just known him as the person who lived next door.\u201d Wojcicki was influenced by the passion she saw around her, she says: \u201cUniversity professors are generally people who care deeply about a topic.\u201d Was there overwhelming pressure to succeed, growing up alongside so many high-achievers? \u201cI didn\u2019t feel pressure in the way people normally define success, whether that\u2019s with fame or income,\u201d she says. \u201cUniversity professors are always taking a cut in income to do what they want to do; they\u2019re dedicated to their field. I suppose there was some pressure to do what was interesting, to find an area that was meaningful.\u201d As a child, she wanted to be an artist. She studied literature and history at Harvard, not the typical background of tech CEOs, although her business brain was apparent from an early age \u2013 she had a childhood hustle selling homemade spice ropes (plaited yarn threaded with spices) before picking up graduate degrees in business and economics. \u201cI decided to take my first computer science class when I was a senior in college. My whole childhood was about arts and being creative \u2013 I just loved to make and create things \u2013 and it was really only in my senior year that I realised computers and software enabled you to make content, and I saw the creative aspect of it. I had this view beforehand that it was a very boring topic.\u201d This is why she loves YouTube\u2019s creators, she says: \u201cThat interest is what still draws me to technology.\u201d After college, Wojcicki worked in marketing for Intel. A mutual friend introduced her to Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who rented Wojcicki\u2019s garage, where they built their search engine, Google, soon expanding into three ground-floor bedrooms in her house (Wojcicki and her husband, strapped for cash, were pleased to have help with the mortgage). Wojcicki joined Google in 1999, as the company\u2019s 16th employee. \u201cEveryone said: \u2018Why are you joining another search engine? It\u2019s not going to be successful; there are already way too many search engines.\u2019 But I saw right away that Google was offering an ability to find information that was unparalleled.\u201d Still, it was a risk to join this small company. \u201cI was five months\u2019 pregnant, and I had just bought a house, and I had student loans,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cI think it gets back to who I am as a person \u2013 I saw the internet was coming, I saw it was going to be big, and I felt at home at Google because it reminded me of the mission of a lot of universities, which is to enable resources for people to learn, to self-empower by studying and [giving] access to information.\u201d She became Google\u2019s marketing manager, then a senior vice-president overseeing advertising, which is instrumental in driving the vast majority of its gigantic profits \u2013 $9.2bn (\u00a37.6bn) in the latest quarter. Wojcicki was in charge of Google\u2019s video platform in 2005 when she realised a startup, YouTube, was outperforming it. She advised Google to buy it \u2013 which it did, in 2006, for $1.7bn. (The billionaire investor Mark Cuban said at the time that \u201canyone who buys [YouTube] is a moron\u201d, predicting that the site would be \u201csued into oblivion\u201d for hosting copyrighted content.) In 2014, she became its CEO, growing it into a business that is now worth about $160bn. Although Wojcicki is one of the most influential people in tech, she has maintained a low profile, but seems well-regarded in the industry as a steady and diligent leader. She has been vocal about the need to get more women into tech and into leadership positions (Sheryl Sandberg, formerly at Google and now Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, has named Wojcicki as a role model). Under Wojcicki, the proportion of female staff at YouTube has increased from a quarter to a third, she says, \u201cand that includes our leadership\u201d. Why have so few women made it to her level? \u201cIf you look at the pipeline of women graduating with computer science degrees, it\u2019s a much smaller number [than men],\u201d she says. \u201cIn the US, about 20% are women. That just means that, when you get started, there is a smaller pool of women who have those capabilities. The challenge is getting that network started. It\u2019s always hard if you\u2019re the first woman, the only woman, but if you\u2019re working in an organisation where there are a significant number, and not just in the entry-level positions, then younger women understand that they can also achieve these leadership roles.\u201d One of the important factors in keeping women, says Wojcicki, is a generous maternity leave policy. Google offers six months\u2019 paid leave in the US, where there is no federal entitlement to any. \u201cTwenty-five per cent of American women come back to work after 10 days [of having a baby], which is a crazy number,\u201d she says. \u201cAfter I had my last child, I was thinking on day 10: \u2018How would I feel if I had to come back right now?\u2019 And I thought: \u2018I wouldn\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019d rather quit.\u2019\u201d How much sexism has she experienced in her career? \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been supported,\u201d she says, then pauses. \u201cFor the most part. But a lot of times there are micro-aggressions that people aren\u2019t always aware of and that can have a cumulative effect.\u201d Men have spoken over her, or not taken on board what she has said, or not taken her seriously. \u201cAnd so I think I\u2019ve also developed techniques, over 20 years of being in the industry, of learning how to have my words taken seriously, and how to get attention.\u201d Sometimes, she says, she will simply call it out. \u201cOr I\u2019ll find a way to get people to really listen. What I find is, you can\u2019t say comments in a timid, unsure way \u2013 no one\u2019s going to listen to you and no one\u2019s going to take you seriously. You have to be able to state your opinion in a way that is confident.\u201d Getting attention is important, too: \u201cSo, you have to say something like: \u2018No, I completely disagree with your point of view, you\u2019re going in the wrong direction. Let me tell you what I think is the right step for the future.\u2019 And then you\u2019ve opened the door and people are paying attention.\u201d Tech is getting more diverse, she says, which is vital for society. \u201cIt has become such an important force of change in so many parts of our economic landscape,\u201d she says. \u201cIf only 25% of people coming into tech are women, then there are some stories and some perspectives that are not being shared.\u201d Wojcicki\u2019s children range in age from four to late teens. They do watch YouTube, she says (the dedicated kids\u2019 version for the younger ones). How do she and her husband, a Google executive, manage their children\u2019s screen time? \u201cIt\u2019s always important to have balance,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat is important to me is that kids learn how to manage technology responsibly. Just like you talk to your kids about what you do when you go out on the street, you need to have a conversation with them about safety on the internet, and also find a way to manage screen time and balance that with other activities.\u201d Are there arguments over screen time? \u201cI have times when I take away all my kids\u2019 phones, especially if we\u2019re on a family vacation, because I want people to interact with each other. So, I take away their phones and say: \u2018We\u2019re all going to focus on being present today.\u2019 It comes back to balance \u2013 people need to learn when it is a time [to be] focused in the conversation, and when it is OK to go and watch videos or do other activities on the internet.\u201d At what age did they get phones? \u201cWhen my kids started to be in a position when they were on their own, taking a bus or going places, it was useful for them to have a phone,\u201d she says. Once, her daughter got \u201cstuck somewhere and she didn\u2019t have any way to reach us. There are moments when it becomes important for them to have a phone. I think middle school [from about the age of 11] is a reasonable point to start educating them about it, but also a lot of times you can take it away. High school is harder \u2013 you\u2019re dealing with children who are getting close to going to college, and you have zero control when that happens.\u201d She doesn\u2019t like to manage their screen time too much, she says, preferring to let her children create \u201cself-control methods. TV was the same when I was growing up. I was taught that, sure, some TV is enjoyable, but it needs to be balanced with sports, school, homework, reading and other activities.\u201d Wojcicki is worth a reported $500m. Is it hard to maintain any kind of \u201cnormal\u201d life for her children? \u201cI work really hard to give my kids a normal life,\u201d she says. \u201cIn some ways, that\u2019s very manageable, because those are my values \u2013 hard work, doing something meaningful. I do talk to my kids about a lot of the challenges we face at work, because these are issues of society and it\u2019s interesting to hear their point of view. I work incredibly hard to make sure my children are hard-working, respectful and live balanced lives, and I try to set that example.\u201d A typical day involves getting up at 7am or 8am to do some exercise (\u201cI\u2019m not a morning person,\u201d she adds with a smile), taking the children to school and getting to work between 9am and 10am. Sometimes, she stops for lunch, but usually she has a lunch meeting. She tells me about her working style, using impenetrable phrases such as \u201cright processes\u201d, but adds: \u201cI\u2019m not a person who tries to micromanage.\u201d And she tries to get home for dinner. She sets a few rules for herself when she is at home. \u201cI do switch off, and I think that\u2019s incredibly important,\u201d she says. \u201cIf there\u2019s a crisis, then I understand I need to be there and I need to be on top of that situation, but my goal is to make sure we don\u2019t have crises. In general, I try to have evenings where I\u2019m not looking at my phone or doing email or work.\u201d That said, she does check her email at some point later on, because \u201cthings have usually happened in those couple of hours. I also try really hard to take a break on the weekend, and I try not to send emails to my team, because I want them to take a break. I\u2019m a believer that taking breaks leads to higher productivity in the end and more longevity.\u201d Does she have time for anything else? \u201cI like to garden,\u201d she says. \u201cI like animals.\u201d She has chickens and goats. \u201cI like to grow things. I love getting away by doing something completely different from technology, whether it\u2019s learning about bees and having honey, or learning about different types of chickens, or varieties of fruit.\u201d It sounds lovely, I say. She visibly relaxes and says: \u201cIt is.\u201d The day before we meet, the tech site Gizmodo publishes a piece on how extremist channels remain on YouTube, despite the new policies. In the face of fairly constant criticism, does Wojcicki ever feel like walking away? \u201cNo, I don\u2019t. Because I feel a commitment to solving these challenges,\u201d she says. \u201cI care about the legacy that we leave and about how history will view this point in time. Here\u2019s this new technology, we\u2019ve enabled all these new voices. What did we do? Did we decide to shut it down and say only a small set of people will have their voice? Who will decide that, and how will it be decided? Or do we find a way to enable all these different voices and perspectives, but find a way to manage the abuse of it? I\u2019m focused on making sure we can manage the challenges of having an open platform in a responsible way.\u201d Still, it is hard to resist picturing Wojcicki in her garden on a day off, attempting to nurture something beautiful while holding back the unstoppable force of weeds that just keep coming. \u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

      "body": "<p>Had his career gone to plan, Sebasti\u00e1n Velasquez would probably not have been in El Paso last Saturday.</p> <p>Velasquez showed promise in his first three seasons playing in MLS but alcoholism drove him to leave for rehab in 2015. Sober for four years, he signed for El Paso Locomotive FC of the USL Championship in June after a brief stint in South Korea. He was in the gym preparing for a game that evening when a teammate texted him about a shooting at the Walmart near the Ciela Vista Mall. He made it home to his girlfriend and two children where he learned of the mass shooting. His coach told him the game was postponed.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t sleep that night,\u201d Velasquez said. \u201cI stayed up and thought about what I would do in that situation. When you\u2019re a father, you\u2019re always thinking about what would I do if someone pulls out a gun. \u2026 That\u2019s something you can expect at any moment in time.\u201d</p> <p>Usually on game days like last Saturday\u2019s, Velasquez and his teammates would run into Larry Durbin and other members of the 8th Notch \u2013 the Locomotives\u2019 supporters group \u2013 and have a chat. After the shooting, they messaged each other to see if everyone was OK. An 8th Notch member had been inside the Walmart, though was unscathed. By the end of the weekend, Durbin, who teaches at a local high school and coaches the girls\u2019 soccer team as well, knew everyone in the supporters group was fine. But on the first day back in class, he saw how distraught his players were over the loss of a classmate who had been killed.</p> <p>\u201cIt hit them pretty hard,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been with some counselors and they just had a memorial for that person on Monday. That was tough and they\u2019re a little better, but you can still see it in their eyes.\u201d</p> <p>The 8th Notch were there when Durbin\u2019s team lost to the eventual state champions last season and they will be there for a Local Legends game tentatively scheduled for Sunday at the high school. Proceeds from that game will go to victims as well as the Paso del Norte Soccer League. Four coaches of the Fusion \u2013 an independent girls\u2019 team in the league \u2013 were wounded as they were preparing for their fall season fundraiser. One assistant coach died and a 15-year-old player for another boys\u2019 team was killed as well. Before the shooting, Paso del Norte was an increasingly successful youth league that had overcome tight budgets and long road trips to compete at the highest levels of American youth soccer.</p> <p>\u201cWe were celebrating because two weeks ago, two of our teams went to the Presidents\u2019 Cup and came back as national champions,\u201d board member Francoise Feliberti said. \u201cWe were planning to do all kinds of fancy stuff to honor them at the beginning of the season and \u2026 OK, we\u2019re still going to do fancy stuff, but we\u2019re also going to do something for the team and the player that was shot inside the Walmart.\u201d</p> <p>A group of Arsenal fans started a GoFundMe for Paso del Norte that Velasquez found and tweeted out. It has raised over $24,000 as of Friday morning. The Locomotive, together with the El Paso Chihuahuas and the MountainStar Sports Group, pledged to donate $150,000 to victims. Another GoFundMe page has been set up by the South Texas Youth Soccer Association, of which Paso del Norte is a member. That page has raised almost $19,000 as well.</p> <p>\u201cWe wanted to make sure that the kids that are in El Paso can play,\u201d Jennifer Davis, the executive director of South Texas Youth Soccer said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen that when kids who have been in tragedies get on the field, they forget all that. It helps them escape for a while and feel normal to just play soccer again. We want them to get back on the field so they can play the game that they love and feel that passion again.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5cd874441de6b26aa37682768d896c3e4ce38003\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5cd874441de6b26aa37682768d896c3e4ce38003/0_0_2500_1667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sebasti\u00e1n Velasquez\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sebasti\u00e1n Velasquez speaks with community members in the wake of last Saturday\u2019s shooting.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: El Paso Locomotive FC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Davis said she also reached out to Chris Canetti, a man who by his own admission has had \u201ctoo much experience\u201d in planning responses to tragedies. Canetti, president of Houston\u2019s 2026 World Cup Bid committee, arranged a donation to survivors of the Santa Fe shooting when he was president of the Houston Dynamo and Houston Dash. He also organized the Soccer Night in Newtown event after the Sandy Hook shooting. David, Canetti and Velasquez are planning a charity friendly that they hope involves current and retired American and Mexican men\u2019s and women\u2019s players.</p> <p>Velasquez has received the Locomotive\u2019s blessing to take the lead on organizing the event while also training for their match against top-of-the-table Phoenix Rising FC this weekend. When he was a boy, Velasquez split his time between South Carolina and Medell\u00edn, Colombia, where he was taught about \u2018invisible borders\u2019, the lines separating neighborhoods where rival drug gangs fought from where the city was safe. After last Saturday\u2019s shooting, his friends in Medellin asked him how the United States got so dangerous.</p> <p>\u201cThat just means that the people from my country think the people here are crazy, while the people here think that we\u2019re mass murderers and drug dealers.

      "bodyText": "Had his career gone to plan, Sebasti\u00e1n Velasquez would probably not have been in El Paso last Saturday. Velasquez showed promise in his first three seasons playing in MLS but alcoholism drove him to leave for rehab in 2015. Sober for four years, he signed for El Paso Locomotive FC of the USL Championship in June after a brief stint in South Korea. He was in the gym preparing for a game that evening when a teammate texted him about a shooting at the Walmart near the Ciela Vista Mall. He made it home to his girlfriend and two children where he learned of the mass shooting. His coach told him the game was postponed. \u201cI didn\u2019t sleep that night,\u201d Velasquez said. \u201cI stayed up and thought about what I would do in that situation. When you\u2019re a father, you\u2019re always thinking about what would I do if someone pulls out a gun. \u2026 That\u2019s something you can expect at any moment in time.\u201d Usually on game days like last Saturday\u2019s, Velasquez and his teammates would run into Larry Durbin and other members of the 8th Notch \u2013 the Locomotives\u2019 supporters group \u2013 and have a chat. After the shooting, they messaged each other to see if everyone was OK. An 8th Notch member had been inside the Walmart, though was unscathed. By the end of the weekend, Durbin, who teaches at a local high school and coaches the girls\u2019 soccer team as well, knew everyone in the supporters group was fine. But on the first day back in class, he saw how distraught his players were over the loss of a classmate who had been killed. \u201cIt hit them pretty hard,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been with some counselors and they just had a memorial for that person on Monday. That was tough and they\u2019re a little better, but you can still see it in their eyes.\u201d The 8th Notch were there when Durbin\u2019s team lost to the eventual state champions last season and they will be there for a Local Legends game tentatively scheduled for Sunday at the high school. Proceeds from that game will go to victims as well as the Paso del Norte Soccer League. Four coaches of the Fusion \u2013 an independent girls\u2019 team in the league \u2013 were wounded as they were preparing for their fall season fundraiser. One assistant coach died and a 15-year-old player for another boys\u2019 team was killed as well. Before the shooting, Paso del Norte was an increasingly successful youth league that had overcome tight budgets and long road trips to compete at the highest levels of American youth soccer. \u201cWe were celebrating because two weeks ago, two of our teams went to the Presidents\u2019 Cup and came back as national champions,\u201d board member Francoise Feliberti said. \u201cWe were planning to do all kinds of fancy stuff to honor them at the beginning of the season and \u2026 OK, we\u2019re still going to do fancy stuff, but we\u2019re also going to do something for the team and the player that was shot inside the Walmart.\u201d A group of Arsenal fans started a GoFundMe for Paso del Norte that Velasquez found and tweeted out. It has raised over $24,000 as of Friday morning. The Locomotive, together with the El Paso Chihuahuas and the MountainStar Sports Group, pledged to donate $150,000 to victims. Another GoFundMe page has been set up by the South Texas Youth Soccer Association, of which Paso del Norte is a member. That page has raised almost $19,000 as well. \u201cWe wanted to make sure that the kids that are in El Paso can play,\u201d Jennifer Davis, the executive director of South Texas Youth Soccer said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen that when kids who have been in tragedies get on the field, they forget all that. It helps them escape for a while and feel normal to just play soccer again. We want them to get back on the field so they can play the game that they love and feel that passion again.\u201d Davis said she also reached out to Chris Canetti, a man who by his own admission has had \u201ctoo much experience\u201d in planning responses to tragedies. Canetti, president of Houston\u2019s 2026 World Cup Bid committee, arranged a donation to survivors of the Santa Fe shooting when he was president of the Houston Dynamo and Houston Dash. He also organized the Soccer Night in Newtown event after the Sandy Hook shooting. David, Canetti and Velasquez are planning a charity friendly that they hope involves current and retired American and Mexican men\u2019s and women\u2019s players. Velasquez has received the Locomotive\u2019s blessing to take the lead on organizing the event while also training for their match against top-of-the-table Phoenix Rising FC this weekend. When he was a boy, Velasquez split his time between South Carolina and Medell\u00edn, Colombia, where he was taught about \u2018invisible borders\u2019, the lines separating neighborhoods where rival drug gangs fought from where the city was safe. After last Saturday\u2019s shooting, his friends in Medellin asked him how the United States got so dangerous. \u201cThat just means that the people from my country think the people here are crazy, while the people here think that we\u2019re mass murderers and drug dealers. That\u2019s the crazy perspective that this country has come to. I got my US citizenship when I was 18 and it\u2019s given me opportunities and safety. We think the US is so much safer but now we\u2019re talking about 251 mass shootings and it\u2019s become an unexpected. It\u2019s not like in Medellin where you know where not to go. Here you go to grocery mall, you go to a grocery store or you go to a school and you don\u2019t know if your kid is coming back or your parents or you and that\u2019s scary.\u201d Velasquez and his girlfriend found El Paso to remind them of the places they grew up and are looking to find a home to raise their newborn daughter and his four-year-old son. When he asked for ideas for a date night, his teammates recommended crossing the border to Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico. The images of the cartel violence that plagued the city came to his head, but they told him it\u2019s where they go for a nice dinner. When he became a father, Velasquez vowed to stay sober. \u201cI don\u2019t want my kids to grow up in this situation and I don\u2019t want to sit at work while my kid is at school and think if something bad is going to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what this country is about. This country is diverse and soccer players are diverse. You have 26 players on a team all from different places, you go to America and it\u2019s made up of millions of people from different places and you have to figure out how to live as one and be as safe as you can. It\u2019s the same situation with a soccer team and when times get hard you have to make change with action.\u201d",

Played by Sean Kearns, he\u2019s as much punchbag as character, taking the blows with a matter-of-fact acceptance that only adds to the mounting surrealism. This surely wasn\u2019t what was meant by \u201ctruth and reconciliation\u201d, but it feels like a boil that needed to be lanced. \u2022 At Traverse theatre, Edinburgh, until 25 August. \u2022 Read all our Edinburgh festival reviews.",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s rare for a writer to be self-conscious about the number of books lining the walls of their living room, particularly when they are one of France\u2019s greatest living writers. But Annie Ernaux, whose sharp and often heartbreaking portraits of French daily life, class and society are enjoying a rush of interest in the English-speaking world, is aware that her bookshelves mark how far she\u2019s come from a working-class childhood in rural Normandy. \u201cYou\u2019ve read all this?\u201d gasped one relative on a visit to her book-filled house on the outskirts of a 1970s commuter town north of Paris.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s terrible to play yourself down,\u201d says the 78-year-old Ernaux. But it was that \u201cexperience of limitation\u201d, that unwritten rule \u201cnot to venture above your station in life\u201d, that defined the tough world of factories and farm-workers she grew up in, she says. Ernaux\u2019s mother, who features in much of her writing, refused to accept the supposed inferiority she was born to \u2013 she progressed from gruelling and greasy work in a margarine factory to running a small cafe-grocery and \u201cwas an exception in her social class\u201d. Ernaux was pushed on by her mother, who had left school aged 12 but was a voracious reader and believed books and learning were the ticket to a different future. \u201cMy mother always washed her hands before opening a book,\u201d she recalls.</p> <p>In France, Ernaux, who for many years taught literature at secondary school, is seen as perhaps the greatest chronicler of French society in the last 50 years \u2013 a kind of guardian of collective memory. She is one of the few women on France\u2019s male-dominated high school literature syllabuses. In a deceptively succinct, factual style, she lays bare troubling secrets and bodily experiences often hidden away: illegal abortion, dementia, cancer, sex.</p> <p>What\u2019s different about Ernaux is that her books for the past 30 years have been meticulously pieced together from observation and memory of real events; everything has to be accurate and factual, down to the very precise words of an era, the words of a song, the exact colour of a jumper, all set within gripping narratives. This has proved problematic \u2013 should her writing be categorised as fiction or non-fiction? \u2013 and some English-speaking critics and publishers are now tempted to place it as memoir. Ernaux is adamant: she writes novels, fiction. The act of submerging yourself in an era and telling a story there, \u201cto recreate and rebuild from words and feelings\u201d is clearly a literary act, she believes.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the work of a novelist to tell the truth.

It tells the story of France from 1941 to the present day through the thread of a woman\u2019s life story. It draws on Ernaux\u2019s youth in Yvetot in Normandy, conversations between the soldiers of the first and second world wars that she overheard as a child in her mother\u2019s cafe, moving on to the protests of May 1968 and social progress, such as the arrival of the pill, which many doctors at first didn\u2019t mention or want to prescribe. It is meticulous in its references to the slogans, the expressions, the consumerism and the meals of each era. \u201cFor me, the memory of times past is linked to meals and the conversations around them. So I took that as a central thread. It\u2019s not intellect that\u2019s at work in that moment, it\u2019s something else, something deep from childhood.

Ernaux had separated from her husband. \u201cAt the time, I was having what you would call a torrid relationship,\u201d Ernaux says, which her mother didn\u2019t know about. \u201cThere was this kind of old deep-seated shame that resurfaced in me, as my mother was someone who had always wanted to ban all sexuality. And in one really strange moment, after having spent a night with that man, I went to see her and she suddenly said: \u201cAren\u2019t you ashamed?\u201d</p> <p>Ernaux wrote the diary to cope. \u201cWhen you\u2019re locked in the present, a diary is a type of exit we give ourselves \u2013 an escape which is obviously temporary, but helped the situation I was going through.\u201d</p> <p>She put the diary aside for years without opening it. \u201cI would never have wanted to publish it, then one day I was about to go on a trip to a university in the US and, I don\u2019t know why, I thought I must type up the handwritten notes.

It had been the great family secret \u2013 Ernaux had a sister who died of diphtheria at six years old. \u201cThey had only wanted one child, but after her death, they decided to have another,\u201d says Ernaux. She discovered the fact aged 10, but no one had ever felt able to talk about it. \u201cI\u2019m a replacement child, I would not have been born if my sister had lived. That\u2019s quite a discovery \u2013 it wasn\u2019t clear in my head, and through writing, suddenly it became clear.\u201d</p> <p>One of Ernaux\u2019s recent big-selling books in France, <em>Portrait of the Artist as a Young </em><em>Woman</em>, will be published in English early next year \u2013 the story of an 18-year-old\u2019s troubling first sexual experiences in 1958 and the shaming of young girls by their peer group. Ernaux, a feminist who once wondered whether she would die \u201cwithout seeing the women\u2019s revolution\u201d, says she has lived through massive change for women in France and, as a 45-year-old in the 1980s, lived in a way \u201calmost impossible to countenance in the 1950s\u201d. She feels women\u2019s battle for equal rights has progressed in the last few years, but is far from over. A decade ago, she had feared what she felt was \u201ca return to a traditional vision, feminism was a dirty word, and then #MeToo came.

There was a whole generation of twentysomething women whose view of masculine privilege had changed.\u201d</p> <p>Politics is \u201cinseparable from writing\u201d, she feels. She had sympathy for the many gilets jaunes anti-government protesters in France last autumn. She has been vocal about what she sees as France\u2019s obsession with Muslim women who choose to cover their heads.</p> <p>For years, she felt that if she succeeded at writing, she would be able to somehow \u201cavenge\u201d her people, her social standing \u2013 \u201cthat feeling of belonging to an inferior class\u201d. She says: \u201cI was the only one in my mother\u2019s family who studied, and on my father\u2019s side there was one cousin who studied history. So writing to me was a way I could bring something. But I was wrong. I thought that if I wrote, I would avenge my whole people, but no, I would simply have succeeded as an individual. Nothing more, nothing less.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 I Remain in Darkness will be published in the UK in September and Portrait of the Artist as a Young Woman next February, both by Fitzcarraldo Editions.</em></p>",

West Midlands police described the attack on Friday night as a \u201ctruly outrageous\u201d outbreak of targeted gang violence in Saltley. A day earlier, James Teer, 20, was fatally wounded in a drive-by shooting just metres from his home in nearby Erdington. Friday\u2019s disorder began with a car chase in Washwood Heath Road involving a VW Golf and a blue BMW. The latter vehicle crashed into a wall by Silver Birch Close at around 6.40pm and the two occupants were targeted with a shotgun and a machete by two men wearing face coverings in a cul-de-sac where children were outside playing. A 23-year-old man sustained cuts to his legs and remains in hospital, while another 23-year-old escaped with a minor graze from a shotgun pellet. He was discharged from hospital but arrested on suspicion of also possessing a firearm. The attackers fled in the VW and efforts were under way to trace the vehicle and those responsible. West Midlands police said: \u201cWitnesses have told that several shots were fired and it\u2019s very fortunate innocent people, including children, were not injured. We believe this was a targeted attack between rival groups. \u201cIt\u2019s simply not acceptable for people to engage in this level of violence in residential streets and we all need to work together to catch those responsible and send out a message that our communities won\u2019t tolerate this.\u201d A postmortem examination on Teer\u2019s body was to take place on Saturday afternoon. West Midlands police said the two attacks were not thought to be linked. Officers working on the Teer case were trawling CCTV, carrying out local enquiries and speaking to witnesses. Detectives were keen to hear from anyone who had dash-cam footage of a dark coloured car in the area at the time that is understood to have been involved. Birmingham police Supt Sarah Burton said: \u201cWe have a specially trained family liaison officer supporting James\u2019s loved ones. They are totally devastated and inconsolable; they can\u2019t comprehend what\u2019s happened and want answers. \u201cThis was an outrageous act in the early evening on one of our streets.

They don\u2019t call it the championship quarter for nothing. Uncharacteristically low shooting percentages from both goal attacks for the Giants - Jo Harten going to the bench with 16/25 at 64% and Kiera Austin taking her place and managing 4/7 at 57% - was a big factor. The shooting circle looked to have finally found its rhythm a couple of weeks ago against the Magpies, but hasn\u2019t been able to find it again since then. The Lightning were typically clinical, Steph Wood bouncing back from a below par performance by her standards last week to shoot 21/27 at 77% along with 15 goal assists and 19 feeds. Karla Pretorius played at her incredible best with eight gains, three intercepts and four rebounds. How any team can stop her with finals just around the corner is the big question.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/9Netball/status/1160081559849861120\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">WHAT.

At first glance I was thinking the strong winds in Sydney today were affecting the Swans\u2019 ability to kick, but it turns out the Adelaide Oval is not in Sydney - who would have guessed? Perhaps the players have got some sympathy kicks going on with their fans back home? Either way they\u2019ve managed only four goals today, but 10 behinds, meaning they have had as many scoring shots as Port, but haven\u2019t been able to convert at the same rate.

If they can tighten that up in the second half they\u2019ll be sweet.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AFL/status/1160057586986569728\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">HT: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PAFC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@PAFC</a> 7.7 (49) leads <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sydneyswans?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@sydneyswans</a> 4.10 (34).<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AFLPowerSwans?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#AFLPowerSwans</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/mysjsimG5H\">pic.twitter.com/mysjsimG5H</a></p>&mdash; AFL (@AFL) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AFL/status/1160057586986569728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 10, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d4e50e78f08c7e177d48065\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-10T05:10:41.291Z\">6.10am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>AFL: </strong>Half-time in a very low scoring affair at the G today, sees Collingwood leading Melbourne by 18 points.

      "bodyText": "Well that\u2019s it from me tonight - I leave you in the very capable hands of Richard Parkin as he takes you through the Bledisloe Cup / Rugby Championships match between the Wallabies and the All Blacks. Fingers crossed it\u2019s not too much of a blood bath. Thanks for your company and I\u2019ll be back some time in the not too distant future to Sportwatch again! Well it was a percentage booster the Lions were after and boy did they get it in the Queensland derby! An impressive 381 disposals at 76% efficiency for the Lions in that game will fill them with confidence going into the final few rounds. With that win they\u2019ve shot to the top of the ladder, but West Coast and Geelong are yet to play this round. Reed Mahoney will be in Mitchell Moses\u2019 good books, scoring the only try for the Eels that was in a good position for the kicker to convert. It was an arm wrestle of a game and won\u2019t fill the Eels with confidence as they look to cement their place in the eight on the run in to finals. In the end it was superior possession (55% to 45%) and a higher completion rate (89% to 83%) that really sealed the deal for the Eels. They will take some positives from that, but will be looking to turn that possession into points much more often over the coming weeks. Super Netball: With the top of the ladder NSW Swifts and the third-placed Vixens about to get going in Sydney, take some time to get up to speed on a bit of an ugly Round 11 courtesy of Erin Delahunty\u2019s brilliant column. I know she was particularly proud at being able to use the word \u2018claret\u2019 in this one - not a super common occurrence for us netball writers - so please enjoy! Drugs in sport: This was a really interesting piece from during the week about why we\u2019re still seeing athletes being caught for doping many years into the future. \u201cThat athletes from the 2012 Olympics are still being caught cheating might come as surprise. But the World Anti-Doping Code (WADC 2015) provides for a 10-year window following a competition to test athletes\u2019 samples for a possible doping violation. This is known as retrospective testing.\u201d WinnieOfOz has a great story about her dad to share: Mine was a born and bred Geelong fan, and I have two main memories of him: One is standing in the front yard in Bendigo, early sixties, desperately trying to get/keep reception from 3GL. Second was dashing from the church before the bride and groom (my younger brother) to listen to the car radio, given they had the gall to get married during the finals. Being from a family where you were Geelong from birth, I find it odd to come across families where people cheer different teams. Obviously it\u2019s different if both parents are passionate. I know a couple who married many decades ago (kids are adults) where he said \u2018they can have your religion, but they\u2019re getting my football team\u2019. Sounded like a fair compromise to me. My husband and I have been lucky in that we\u2019re passionate about different sports, so we don\u2019t have to fight over our daughter\u2019s loyalty. She does have a difficult time understanding that the Richmond Tigers are never going to play the St George-Illawarra Dragons though. How have other Sportwatchers dealt with competing sporting loyalties? A much improved second half wasn\u2019t enough to stop the Ferns - an unstoppable force with no immovable object in their way. Rugby in Australia is facing an uphill battle in all facets of the game, but perhaps it is most stark in the women\u2019s game where years of sidelining girls has created such a small player pool to draw from - and most of those players are choosing other sports. Some serious hard work to be done from administrators in marketing and promoting the game outside the sphere of private boys\u2019 schools in Sydney and Brisbane if they want to compete with the sensational New Zealanders. Wallroos captain Grace Hamilton was definite on areas for improvement when she spoke after the game. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got to maintain possession,\u201d she said. \u201cKey errors really lost us that game. I thought our scrum was dominant, so that\u2019s a nice positive to take out of this. Our backs were great also, we didn\u2019t do enough to support them defensively, but I\u2019m really proud of them.\u201d Cricket: It\u2019s been unusual to see Australia\u2019s pace attack without Mitchell Starc during the first Ashes test. Though the bowlers undoubtedly did their job, we have grown accustomed to Starc\u2019s face and pace bearing down on opposing teams in recent years. Adam Collins caught up with Alyssa Healy\u2019s other half to see how he\u2019s coping with this unexpected stint on the sidelines. Supplements: This was a fascinating read during the week by the excellent Stephanie Convery on the supplements saga in sport in the wake of the Shayna Jack incident. Steph has done a great job of breaking down the issue with some of these supplements and the huge market they have created in the last few years. NRL: Half-time at Parramatta and the Eels lead the Knights 8-2. Clinton Gutherson has been the go-to for the home team, scoring both tries, though I think Mitchell Moses might appreciate him scoring them a little closer to the posts so he can convert them. They\u2019re strong at home, the Eels with seven wins and just two losses from home games this year, so they will be looking to build that momentum into the second half. Love this comment from ID9357571: I grew up in an internationalist house with a dad who abhorred narrow sporting nationalism for its boorishness. He adored, amongst others, Ali, George Best and Viv Richards. He loved his politics and wore them on his sleeve. He carried a few odd sports conspiracies, like the America\u2019s Cup was given to Australia as a win, win swap for Rupert Murdoch. So for me it was natural to find a team from other countries to follow. Apart from South Africa and Queensland (of course) I had favourite teams from all over the world. In RU I landed with the AB\u2019s (tough at times) and still follow them today. They have had a deserved but at times charmed run against the Wallabies. But tonight I think they will be turned over by an Australian side that is gearing up nicely for the world Cup. I\u2019m looking forward to people admitting they like the game again. I must admit I am starting to come around to that point of view of not necessarily following Australia in every sport. Not sure I could ever come around to being a full time All Blacks supporter though, that might be a bridge too far - along with becoming an England cricket supporter! Cricket: Enigma One in the comments is joining me in being quite happy to see England in a panic after one test. They say: The series is of course still very much alive so I don\u2019t want to get too carried away, but it\u2019s always fun to see England and its fans in panic mode. Said \u201cfans\u201d eviscerate their own like no other fans on the planet. It\u2019s incredibly entertaining, in its own weird way. It\u2019s true, no one panics quite like the English. Though I wonder if they\u2019re panicking quite enough about this whole Brexit palaver? Seems a little more pressing than a couple of Steve Smith centuries perhaps? AFL: The Lions have a strong lead over the Suns in the Queensland derby, going into half-time 38 points ahead. Charles Cameron is having an absolute field day out there, with four goals and five disposals at 100% efficiency. This is a big game for the Lions as they attempt to boost their percentage and make a move for top spot on the ladder. Rugby: Half-time in the women\u2019s rugby test and the Wallaroos haven\u2019t yet found an answer to the Kiwi defence, other than \u201cIt\u2019s really, really good.\u201d Their attack isn\u2019t bad either to be honest, they lead the Australians 22-0 at half-time. It\u2019s a hard ask beating a country that lives and breathes rugby, but the Wallaroos desperately need to find some answers during the break. Football: It\u2019s nice to read some truly happy and wonderful sports news and this article put a smile on my face during the week. It brought back memories of the women\u2019s State of Origin last year and the kiss between NSW Blues star Vanessa Foliaki and Queensland skipper Karina Brown. Little moments like this can have a huge impact and it\u2019s wonderful that women\u2019s sport so often provides them. Cricket: With only four days before the next Ashes Test and England in a panic, it\u2019s good to hear that Australian coach Justin Langer has a plan in place to make them panic a bit more. Adam Collins, who may well be a British citizen by now, as he\u2019s been over there since the start of the World Cup, which as well all know went for 24 years, spoke to Langer during the week and found out just how the Australians are planning to destroy the English. Suburban Sportwatch: Very keen to hear how all the Sportwatchers have gone in their games today - let me know in the comments if you had a milestone game, a big win or you\u2019re just celebrating getting out there and competing. I dashed to Guardian HQ from my netball game today, where we went down 57-46 in our last round game before the semis. We were pretty happy with the effort against the top ranked team and think we can take them down during the finals series. You can see me here living my best WD life. Rugby league: As I mentioned earlier, I was at the Women in Sport Summit this week and as part of the conference, we were treated to a screening of a pretty incredible documentary called Power Meri made by rugby league journalist Joanna Lester on the journey of the PNG Orchids to the 2017 Rugby League World Cup. Do yourself a favour and find a way to see it - I highly recommend trying to get a screening at your local school or sports club. It\u2019s an amazing story and beautifully told. A hugely inspiring group of women. Rugby: We are underway in Perth with the Wallaroos, with the Wallabies to follow later tonight. It\u2019s a big year for rugby and Bret Harris has done a great job of explaining why the Australia and New Zealand battles are so important, even in a World Cup year. Oh my goodness, it happened. The Dragons won a game! It wasn\u2019t pretty, but it happened. The Titans looked dangerous through the middle of the second half, but the Dragons held them off after the score got within eight and finished with a try of their own to seal the win. Tariq Sims bagged a double for the day, while Tyson Frizell and Paul Vaughan were seemingly unstoppable, making 169m and 237m respectively. A poor third quarter ultimately hurt the Giants, going down by six while keeping pace in every other quarter in the match. They don\u2019t call it the championship quarter for nothing. Uncharacteristically low shooting percentages from both goal attacks for the Giants - Jo Harten going to the bench with 16/25 at 64% and Kiera Austin taking her place and managing 4/7 at 57% - was a big factor. The shooting circle looked to have finally found its rhythm a couple of weeks ago against the Magpies, but hasn\u2019t been able to find it again since then. The Lightning were typically clinical, Steph Wood bouncing back from a below par performance by her standards last week to shoot 21/27 at 77% along with 15 goal assists and 19 feeds. Karla Pretorius played at her incredible best with eight gains, three intercepts and four rebounds. How any team can stop her with finals just around the corner is the big question. So my old friend Dr Rudi tells me in the comments that it is indeed quite windy in Adelaide today too, so we might forgive the Swans a bit for their inaccuracy. Though Port seemed to be able to find some non-windy moments to score double the amount of goals the Swans managed. Big game for Connor Rozee with 20 disposals, 10 kicks and three goals for the home team. The 47-point win was just enough to squeeze Port into the top eight ahead of local rivals the Adelaide Crows - who will look to take eighth place back when they play West Coast tomorrow. Ollie Wines was happy with his team, especially managing to snag the last goal, which got them over the line percentage-wise. \u201cToday was really important for us, we\u2019ve put two wins in a row together now and just want to ride that momentum and win the last two,\u201d he said after the game. \u201cWe adapted throughout the game today and were able to pull off the win, which was really pleasing.\u201d Motor sport: \u201cThree years of planning for a three month season\u201d could be the description of all manner of women\u2019s sporting competitions. There are so many barriers in the way, but good on Catherine Bond Muir for knocking them down. Looking forward to seeing where the W Series goes in future. Football: Look, I\u2019m not going to pretend to have too much clue about what went on with all the Premier League transfers this week, but I know it was HUGE NEWS. Fortunately we have some awesome football writers here at the Guardian who were all over it and they\u2019ve provided this excellent summary of who\u2019s in, who\u2019s out and which teams did the best out of the window. It\u2019s time to toot my own horn a bit - my favourite time in the Sportwatch session! I had a fabulous week at the Women in Sport Summit that was held in Melbourne listening to lots of incredible speakers. I wrote a piece off the back of it that attempts to pull it all together and look at where to next for women\u2019s sport in Australia? It\u2019s been a huge three years, but what is the next step to keep that momentum going? Netball: Dr Rudi, one of our regular commenters here on Sportwatch asks: Megan - by the way, isn\u2019t Laura Clemesha too young to call it quits? There\u2019s a spot for her in the T-birds if she wants. It is pretty unusual for a netballer to retire so young, but I suspect Laura has probably been advised that she\u2019s surplus to requirements for the Firebirds next season and has either scoped out likely places available interstate or decided she\u2019s not keen on leaving Brisbane. While we are seeing much more player movement in the Super Netball days, it\u2019s still a big ask for a player like Clemesha, who would be at the lower end of the payment spectrum, to shift her life for $30k a season. Not a game that either team will be overly happy about in the scheme of things, but Collingwood will be happy to walk away from it with the four points, which will push them above GWS on the ladder. Steele Sidebottom was everywhere for the Pies, with 28 disposals and 18 kicks. Speaking after the game, Scott Pendlebury was happy with the performance, though recognises the Pies have a way to go before finals. \u201cI think we played our way for the majority of today,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been building from last week into today - it\u2019s good to get a couple of wins in a row. Sidebottom just runs guys into the ground and it looks like he\u2019s got so much space, but we know he\u2019s probably just run 3 or 400m to get it.\u201d Rugby: A big game coming up tonight for the Wallabies - this will really test where they\u2019re at before the start of the World Cup next month. Richard Parkin has you covered for this one, he will be live blogging the match and will be looking at all the key talking points as they arise. Super Netball: An enthralling battle is underway in Sydney, with the Giants taking a one-goal lead into the half-time break. The teams have split the bonus points on offer so far, with the Lightning going into quarter time one ahead. Smart play from the Giants at the end of the first half saw them use up enough time to score themselves and make the Lightning use their next centre pass without scoring, meaning they will come back with the first centre pass next half. In a game this close, those little moments can be crucial. Good to see the Giants have tidied up since last week and are not attracting as much whistle - they have only 21 penalties so far to the Lightning\u2019s 23, a far cry from their 59 last week. NRL: Half time at Kogarah and the Dragons are - sorry, how do we spell this, winning? Sure, it\u2019s only by six and they let in a needless late try, but this is a very unfamiliar feeling for the Red V. Hopefully someone is petitioning the NRL to give away ladder points for half-time leads as we speak. The usual suspects stepping up with tries to Paul Vaughan, Tariq Sims and Tyson Frizell, while Gareth Widdop has been solid with the boot. Cricket: I love that there are over 1000 comments on this article. Mass panic in the motherland since the first Ashes Test and no one is quite sure how to stop Steve Smith. He\u2019s like some kind of evil genius and I hope he really leans into that coming into the second test and goes full moustache twirling, white cat stroking super villain on them. Maybe the plan should be to select James Bond for the next game? AFL: A very interesting piece from Kirby Fenwick this week on the long overdue move from the AFL in addressing the many mental health concerns arising out of the game. Along with concussion, this is due to be one of the most crucial issues in professional sport of the current age, so it will be fascinating to follow the progress of this move. Cricket: Lovely piece here from Isa Guha on the comebacks of Steve Smith and Ben Stokes. They\u2019ve had very different journeys and different roles in their teams, but it is interesting to compare and contrast how they have dealt with returning to the top level of the sport. AFL: Port Adelaide had a strong second half to build their lead over the Swans, up by 15 at the main break. At first glance I was thinking the strong winds in Sydney today were affecting the Swans\u2019 ability to kick, but it turns out the Adelaide Oval is not in Sydney - who would have guessed? Perhaps the players have got some sympathy kicks going on with their fans back home? Either way they\u2019ve managed only four goals today, but 10 behinds, meaning they have had as many scoring shots as Port, but haven\u2019t been able to convert at the same rate. The good news for the red and whites is that they\u2019re not being comprehensively out-played, they just need to find a way to get on target. If they can tighten that up in the second half they\u2019ll be sweet. AFL: Half-time in a very low scoring affair at the G today, sees Collingwood leading Melbourne by 18 points. Despite a very poor start from the Pies, they had a strong second quarter to take a pretty decisive lead in the context of the game. Brody Mihocek has been the standout for Collingwood with eight disposals, six kicks and two goals for the first half, while Scott Pendlebury and Josh Thomas are also seeing plenty of the ball and distributing it well. We\u2019ll keep an eye on how this one progresses and see if the teams are able to find the space between the two big sticks a bit more often this half. Another big day in sport awaits us - so strap yourselves in and get ready for a full afternoon of sport here on Sportwatch before I hand you over to Richard Parkin for the Wallabies big game against the All Blacks later this evening. But before then we have some huge clashes coming your way, with a couple of AFL game already underway, Super Netball and NRL about to get started and the women\u2019s rugby test coming up in a couple of hours. So let\u2019s get into it and hope we don\u2019t get snowed on like the poor old Giants and Hawks last night!",

Russia\u2019s ministry of defence first confirmed the explosion on Thursday, saying two people had been killed and six injured in a botched test of a liquid-fueled rocket engine. The injured included ministry employees and civilian contractors. Rosatom\u2019s statement may indicate that three of those first reported as injured had since died. Despite reports that the wounded had been transported to Moscow for medical care, neither their names nor locations had been confirmed. The explosion caused radiation levels to rise for about half an hour in Severodvinsk, contradicting official ministry of defence claims that there had been no rise in radiation levels. Severodvinsk removed a statement confirming the spike in radiation levels from its website, saying the ministry was managing the response to the incident. While local officials urged calm, residents in several cities stocked up on iodine, which is often used to limit the effects of radiation exposure. Russia also closed a bay in the White Sea to civilian traffic for a month, driving speculation that either the water had been contaminated or that a search operation was being launched.",

The new information war is being fought online, particularly on social media, in democracies like ours, too. \u201cI can see people I have known my whole life slipping away from me on social media,\u201d Pomerantsev says, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/23/conspiracy-theories-internet-survivors-truth\" title=\"\">reposting conspiracies from sources I have never heard of</a>.\u201d</p> <p>He cites a study of 54m comments in various Facebook groups, by Dr Walter Quattrociocchi of the University of Venice, which found that the longer a discussion continued, the more extreme people\u2019s comments became. Social media, Pomerantsev says, \u201cis a sort of mini-narcissism engine that can never quite be satisfied, leading us to take up more radical positions to get more attention.\u201d The accuracy of those positions is irrelevant, because it\u2019s not about winning an argument: \u201cYou just want to get the most attention possible from like-minded people.\u201d This has consequences, beyond the boosting of one\u2019s ego. \u201cSocial media drives more polarised behaviour, which leads to demands for more sensationalised content, or plain lies.\u201d</p> <p>Still, the link between disinformation and the rise of autocracy is clear. One theme that links the new age of populists is nostalgia, or as the philologist Svetlana Boym describes it, \u201crestorative nostalgia\u201d, which strives to rebuild lost homelands with \u201cparanoiac determination\u201d. \u201cThe last things desired by those who purvey these phantom, fabricated pasts,\u201d Pomeranstev says, \u201care facts.\u201d Conspiracy is a way to maintain control, he argues. Everyone\u2019s motives are questioned, no one can be trusted. Newspapers, politicians, judges, experts. All have agendas, all are biased. What, then, is the inevitable solution? \u201cIn this murk it becomes best to rely on a strong hand to guide you.\u201d</p> <p><em>This Is Not Propaganda</em> is an exploration of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/14/out-of-the-wreckage-george-monbiot-review\" title=\"\">wreckage of liberal democracy</a> and a search for the signs of its revival. What can save us? Reading, for a start. In Beijing, Pomeranstev meets Angela Wu, who researches emerging technology and cultural change at New York University. She travelled across China interviewing readers of a blogging site called Bullog, which was home to opposition voices. Its readers came from a range of backgrounds, but one thing many of them had in common, Wu discovered, was that they had been voracious readers from a young age. As Pomeranstev puts it: \u201cThe more creative the literature you read, the more you would be able to imagine a different reality to the one around you.\u201d That is something that had helped Igor, too.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/27/the-disinformation-age-a-revolution-in-propaganda\">The disinformation age: a revolution in propaganda</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The book does not prescribe policy solutions, but that\u2019s fine. Before we work out what we\u2019re going to do, we need to understand the scale of the problem \u2013 which Pomerantsev sets out with the right mix of alarm and detail. Many of us in the west show arrogance and ignorance if we believe what happens elsewhere cannot happen here. Our democracy is stronger than that of the Philippines. Our media are more independent than Russia\u2019s. Our institutions have existed longer than Estonia\u2019s.

The new information war is being fought online, particularly on social media, in democracies like ours, too. \u201cI can see people I have known my whole life slipping away from me on social media,\u201d Pomerantsev says, \u201creposting conspiracies from sources I have never heard of.\u201d He cites a study of 54m comments in various Facebook groups, by Dr Walter Quattrociocchi of the University of Venice, which found that the longer a discussion continued, the more extreme people\u2019s comments became. Social media, Pomerantsev says, \u201cis a sort of mini-narcissism engine that can never quite be satisfied, leading us to take up more radical positions to get more attention.\u201d The accuracy of those positions is irrelevant, because it\u2019s not about winning an argument: \u201cYou just want to get the most attention possible from like-minded people.\u201d This has consequences, beyond the boosting of one\u2019s ego. \u201cSocial media drives more polarised behaviour, which leads to demands for more sensationalised content, or plain lies.\u201d Still, the link between disinformation and the rise of autocracy is clear. One theme that links the new age of populists is nostalgia, or as the philologist Svetlana Boym describes it, \u201crestorative nostalgia\u201d, which strives to rebuild lost homelands with \u201cparanoiac determination\u201d. \u201cThe last things desired by those who purvey these phantom, fabricated pasts,\u201d Pomeranstev says, \u201care facts.\u201d Conspiracy is a way to maintain control, he argues. Everyone\u2019s motives are questioned, no one can be trusted. Newspapers, politicians, judges, experts. All have agendas, all are biased. What, then, is the inevitable solution? \u201cIn this murk it becomes best to rely on a strong hand to guide you.\u201d This Is Not Propaganda is an exploration of the wreckage of liberal democracy and a search for the signs of its revival. What can save us? Reading, for a start. In Beijing, Pomeranstev meets Angela Wu, who researches emerging technology and cultural change at New York University. She travelled across China interviewing readers of a blogging site called Bullog, which was home to opposition voices. Its readers came from a range of backgrounds, but one thing many of them had in common, Wu discovered, was that they had been voracious readers from a young age. As Pomeranstev puts it: \u201cThe more creative the literature you read, the more you would be able to imagine a different reality to the one around you.\u201d That is something that had helped Igor, too. The book does not prescribe policy solutions, but that\u2019s fine. Before we work out what we\u2019re going to do, we need to understand the scale of the problem \u2013 which Pomerantsev sets out with the right mix of alarm and detail. Many of us in the west show arrogance and ignorance if we believe what happens elsewhere cannot happen here. Our democracy is stronger than that of the Philippines. Our media are more independent than Russia\u2019s. Our institutions have existed longer than Estonia\u2019s. There is a danger that this complacency may lead us to believe Facebook ads cannot influence our democracy, that politicians cannot manipulate our media, and that someone whose career has been one long information war of lies and half-truths, jokes and smears could never take power in our country. \u2022 Steve Bloomfield is deputy editor of Prospect.

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s hard to overstate the significance of Toni Morrison in the pantheon of global black literature. For many of us she was the lodestar who inspired us to write from within our own cultures, often from female perspectives, and to dignify the heterogeneity of black experiences through literature we could call our own. As a young, aspiring writer I was enriched by her work and empowered by her words of wisdom. I read an interview with her in the seminal Black Women Writers at Work, edited by Claudia Tate, in 1984, which articulated exactly how it felt to be a young black British woman writer at that time. She and others galvanised my generation to write our stories and smash through the walls of the status quo. \u201cThere\u2019s a notion out in the land,\u201d Morrison said, \u201cthat there are human beings one writes about, and then there are black people or Indians or some other marginal group.

We always knew she was on our side.</p> <p>She wrote uncompromisingly about African American society and history, and positioned her characters on the main stage as fully fledged humans with an extensive emotional range and intellectual scope. She showed the complexity of their lives through her formidably imaginative, storytelling powers. Her books were in the tradition of a literature that stretched back to the \u201cslave narratives\u201d of the 19th century and she was by no means the only writer filling in the cultural absences in an American literature that too often excluded, marginalised or stereotyped her people. Writers such as Audre Lorde, Gloria Naylor, Alice Walker and Ntozake Shange were also early inspirations for me. But Morrison reigned supreme, in no small part due to her extensive output of 11 novels and three books of critical thinking, as well as works for children, opera and theatre.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Her legacy will live on through the writers whose imaginations she\u00a0fed and whose craft she\u00a0developed by\u00a0example</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As a book editor for 20 years at Random House, Morrison would have developed her forensic critical eye in nurturing many black writers to publication, before producing her first novel, <em>The Bluest Eye,</em> in 1970, at the age of 39.

In <em>The Bluest Eye</em> she was one of the first writers to explore the all-pervasive perniciousness of shadism within black communities, a byproduct of internalised racism. Pecola, a dark-skinned black girl is considered ugly and longs for the blue eyes she equates with whiteness and acceptability. Any mother of a dark-skinned girl will know that the subject remains as topical today as it was 50 years ago. Morrison was unflinching in exposing social iniquities and their impact on individual lives, while never creating idealised stereotypes.

Her writing could also be oblique, even impressionistic, especially with her later novels, <em>A Mercy</em> (2008), set in the 17th century, and the contemporary <em>God Help the Child</em> (2015), where she returned to the issue of shadism. The timespan of her oeuvre covered 400 years of American history.

      "body": "<h2><strong>Leanne Best, actor</strong></h2> <p><em><strong>A Rockie ride, Colorado</strong></em></p> <p>I was tired. Really tired. It had been a while since I\u2019d taken a break for more than a long weekend. I wanted to see a big sky. And horses. I hadn\u2019t been on a horse since I was a kid and had no idea what I would do with one when I found it, but that was the plan. That was it. Big sky. Horse. I settled on Colorado. You can swing between beautiful towns like Lyon, Loveland and Boulder, and smaller places with family-owned ranches along the way. For a girl from Walton Vale in Liverpool, names like Eagle Rock and Crested Butte leapt off the page and reignited a childhood fascination with the culture and history of the West.</p> <p>I hadn\u2019t given it much thought before I got there, but to my relief, I discovered I still loved to ride. Being around the animals was restorative. I kicked around, travelling from place to place, and picked up trail rides along the foothills of the Rockies, often by word of mouth. You can get around by shuttle bus or the Lyft car-sharing scheme if driving isn\u2019t for you. The landscape was breathtaking. Riding on trails through mountain ranges was easier than I\u2019d thought, bar a sore backside and a few mosquito bites. I stayed at the <a href=\"https://www.sylvandale.com/\" title=\"\">Sylvan Dale ranch</a> (a family-owned business that has offered room, board and a cowgirl school for generations) and cabin-style places (<a href=\"https://www.esteslakelodge.com/\" title=\"\">Estes Lake Lodge</a> was a cracker). I hiked the foothills, visited hot springs, camped out and hung out. There was everything and nothing to do. I spent almost as much time reading in coffee shops (Boulder\u2019s Pearl Street was boutique everything heaven) as I did in the saddle. I found my dream hat in a gas station on Route 36. I indulged my love of crystals at roadside gem and jewellery stores. It\u2019s important to check where traditional pieces are from, but it\u2019s fairly obvious which stores are authentic and have relationships with indigenous artists.</p> <p>I came away from the trip rested and invigorated in equal measure. Even though I didn\u2019t venture completely off road, I wandered far enough to have a fair few Cheryl Strayed moments that will stay with me forever. It\u2019s a place I hope to return to again and again. My own little piece of big sky.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Leanne Best appears in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQJWtTnAHhEG5w4uN0udnUQ\">Carnival Row</a>, on Amazon Prime Video from 30 August</em></p> <h2><strong>Simon Reeve, author and TV presenter</strong></h2> <p><em><strong>Spaced out in Copenhagen</strong></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1a0b6c97e6a0bfa2fb5e174a19e2dfb129d577a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a0b6c97e6a0bfa2fb5e174a19e2dfb129d577a1/0_0_6016_4016/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Graffiti covered walls of Christiania in Copenhagen, Denmark\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Graffiti covered walls of Christiania in Copenhagen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bjanka Kadic/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I went on holiday with my mates in our early 20s. We thought we were going somewhere hot. I\u2019m not sure who was to blame, but we arrived for our flight and discovered somebody had booked us a trip to Copenhagen. Four of the guys only had shorts, one had flip-flops, and none of us had a guidebook. When we arrived it was bitterly cold, so we went to an army surplus store and bought some long, heavy, 1970s grey coats for about a fiver. We looked like escaped prisoners of war.</p> <p>The only thing we could really do in that situation \u2013 being youthful and fairly inexperienced at life and travel \u2013 was to get very drunk. One bar, <a href=\"https://cafe-woodstock.business.site/\" title=\"\">Woodstock</a>, which I\u2019ve since been to as a more sober older person, was like something from Star Wars in an off-world colony \u2013 particularly after a couple of hash cakes. It was in Christiania, the anarchic, free-love area.</p> <p>One of the guys decided to ring his ex-girlfriend, who was working on the \u00d6resund bridge and tunnel project, connecting Denmark with Sweden. She took this group of drunk British men down to the tunnel, a building site at the time. We were in hard hats and tripping. There were lights coming at us \u2013 and me and a mate got it into our heads that there were aliens attacking, so we ran out of an emergency exit and security was called. They had to stop construction, but decided not to press charges. That\u2019s what I think holidays should be about \u2013 not a vanilla-beige experience but a memorable one. Bonding over weirdness and adversity is a wonderful thing to do.</p> <p>Obviously I want people to have deeper experiences and have their eyes opened. But I also think it\u2019s OK to have a weird experience \u2013 and a hash cake \u2013 with your mates.</p> <p>\u2022<em> Step By Step by Simon Reeve </em><em>is published in paperback this week, available for \u00a38.79 from <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/step-by-step-9781473689121.html\" title=\"\">guardianbookshop.com</a></em></p> <h2><strong>Ruby Wax, comedian and writer</strong></h2> <p><em><strong>Seduced by Brazil</strong></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"11675ced5bf80f3d761d141a69f424c2f9047e95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11675ced5bf80f3d761d141a69f424c2f9047e95/760_1254_3871_2322/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trancoso, in north-east Brazil\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trancoso, in north-east Brazil, is \u2018is a Dal\u00ed painting\u2019 say Ruby Wax.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jamie Grill/Getty Images/Tetra images RF</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After I first saw pictures of Trancoso, near Porto Seguro in the state of Bahia, Brazil, I fantasised about it for over a decade. I finally visited two years ago. From S\u00e3o Paulo, you have to take a internal flight, then a two-hour drive along a dirt road. All around the Quadrado, the main square with its church, there\u2019s a real sense of community. There\u2019s football, weddings, funerals, rituals \u2026 there\u2019s even a horse that wanders in and out of bars. All you need do is sit in the cafes looking out and you\u2019ll see life.</p> <p>Suddenly a coffin will go by in the back of a Chevrolet, and everyone\u2019s singing. At night, all the trees sparkle with little lights and people open up the front of their homes as bars, sitting there with their chickens. As you go by, someone will grab you and do the samba. In the next bar there\u2019s capoeira (the Afro-Brazilian martial art that\u2019s like ballet).</p> <p>It\u2019s not a place that\u2019s locked in tradition, it\u2019s playing with tradition. There\u2019s one ritual where everyone dresses in white and they take a long pole and shove it through the window of the person they feel is the most fertile.</p> <p>I travel a lot, but Trancoso is a Dal\u00ed painting. Every house around the Quadrado is a different, blindingly bright colour: turquoise, fuchsia, lime. Inside, there are carved native masks with tribal feathers and religious icons lit up with fairy lights, all mixed with modern elements.</p> <p>The back of the Quadrado drops off to the ocean, and it\u2019s surrounded by the sexiest jungle I\u2019ve ever seen, with lots of exotic birds. People live in the jungle and there are indigenous tribes who\u2019ll invite you to their villages. It\u2019s a neighbourhood, and it\u2019s inclusive. My favourite hotel in the world is here \u2013 <a href=\"http://uxua.com/\" title=\"\">U</a><a href=\"http://uxua.com/\" title=\"\">xua</a>, where everything is made out of natural materials \u2013 even the sinks are in hollowed-out tree trunks. There are a lot of backpacker places, too.</p> <p>I became friends with someone who was about 20, an artist. We didn\u2019t speak the same language but would dance together at night \u2013 and we wept when we had to say goodbye.</p> <p>\u2022 <em><a href=\"http://www.rubywax.net/tour.html\" title=\"\">Ruby Wax: How to be Human</a> is at the Pleasance Grand, Edinburgh, from 18-24 August, then touring the UK until 30 November</em></p> <h2><strong>Marc</strong><strong>us Brigstocke, comedian</strong></h2> <p><em><strong>Laughter in the Alps</strong></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"efd2034098b0ae7c12108db1f30bf25a71910730\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/efd2034098b0ae7c12108db1f30bf25a71910730/0_150_1600_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marcus Brigstocke and fiancee, Rachel Parris, in Austria\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marcus Brigstocke and fiancee, Rachel Parris, in Austria</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HANDOUT</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Every year for the past decade we\u2019ve been skiing in Mayrhofen in Austria.

It had some of the grisliest depictions of Christ\u2019s end that I\u2019ve ever seen \u2013 weird and interesting.</p> <p>Strictly speaking, because we go for the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AltitudeComedyFestival/\" title=\"\">Altitude Comedy Festival</a>, it\u2019s a \u201cwork trip\u201d, but it feels like a holiday to me. It\u2019s a bunch of comedians up a mountain making people howl with laughter. The apr\u00e8s-ski gigs start around 5pm and go on until late. It\u2019s a pretty resort and it turns out that the straightforward, plain-speaking, efficient Austrians are also daft, funny and generous.</p> <p>They also like meat. Pork mostly but meat in general. It\u2019s all a bit fleshy if you\u2019re a vegetarian. Particularly the spa, I suppose. They insist that you spa naked \u2013 so if you want to see comedians having the time of their lives on stage and on skis, but also wonder what they look like naked, this is the place.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Marcus is writer/director of <a href=\"https://edinburghfestival.list.co.uk/event/1368046-the-red/\" title=\"\">The Red</a>, at the Edinburgh Festival until 26 August</em></p> <h2><strong>Deborah Frances-White, comedian and writer</strong></h2> <p><em><strong>On the juice in Portugal</strong></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2921ba59216556469861aa9dd81877026a28ea73\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2921ba59216556469861aa9dd81877026a28ea73/0_495_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Deborah Frances-White\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Deborah Frances-White</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Hambury/@stellapicsltd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the beginning of last year, when it was clear I had already spent the advance for my book, The Guilty Feminist, before I\u2019d finished writing it, each new (over-optimistic) deadline haunted every moment of my fretful sleep. So I went on \u201choliday\u201d to a juice-only retreat up a mountain near Rio Cimeiro in Portugal. A friend overcome by a similar anxiety-inducing writing challenge swore that, taken exclusively, juice is \u201ccocaine for healthy people\u201d. Here are some excerpts from my diary \u2026</p> <p>Day one: A perky woman called Tamara gives us juice and says: \u201cYour friends all think you\u2019re mad coming on this, don\u2019t they?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d we reply, mystified. \u201cWell, they\u2019re probably saying it behind your back. But you\u2019re not mad. Don\u2019t listen to them. They think it\u2019s a cult. It\u2019s not a cult. Repeat after me: Your friends think you\u2019re mad but you\u2019re not in a cult.\u201d</p> <p>Day two: I am overcome with a crippling headache. Not only can I not write my book, I cannot hold my head up or look directly at light. Tamara claims it\u2019s caffeine withdrawals. I believe it to be \u201ceverything withdrawals\u201d. She recommends napping in a \u201cwomb basket\u201d or a caffeinated colonic irrigation. I cling to the womb basket with both hands.</p> <p>Day three: I am dying. Tamara tells me I can have one official juice-based power bar. I have three. I see now there can be no book-writing without food. There is no food. There is no way off the mountain.</p> <p>Day four: I wake up at 3am like a meerkat on amphetamines. I write for four days straight, like Jack Nicholson in The Shining except all the words are different and in a very pleasing order. I need to run each day to burn off the excess energy. I now believe myself to be only two-thirds human and one-third Black Mirror app.</p> <p>Day seven: The mountain is spectacular. The air is bracing. The book is finished. Tamara schools us in hosting a party for our friends back home. The theme of the party is: \u201cJuice is Good and This is Not a Cult\u201d. I\u2019m converted. Juice is good. This is definitely not a cult. I am tempted to throw such a party.</p> <p>Day eight: I\u2019m home.

Me and Hannah, one of my best friends, went to stay with another best friend, Morwenna, who was teaching abroad for a year. I\u2019d barely left the house in two years, but as a determined person I forced myself to go.</p> <p>In the five days of laughter, faffing and catching up on who\u2019d done what, and with whom, we visited a castle, <a href=\"https://castelodesaojorge.pt/en/\" title=\"\">Castela de S\u00e3o J</a><a href=\"https://castelodesaojorge.pt/en/\" title=\"\">orge</a>, one of the highest points of the city, each ate at least 100 <em>pasteis de nata</em> (Portugal\u2019s famous custard tarts), and stayed up dancing in a nightclub, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Esquina-da-Bica-bar-215077045999/\" title=\"\">Esquina d</a><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Esquina-da-Bica-bar-215077045999/\" title=\"\">a Bica</a>, that to the untrained eye looked like someone\u2019s house. Sitting in a sunny square writing postcards to everyone back home, I was reminded of who I was when I wasn\u2019t trapped in my bedroom in Lewisham.</p> <p>None of my predictions of panic attacks or Candice-imposed drama came true. The only mini-drama came when we hired bikes and took the ferry over to Costa da Caparica, a quiet, pretty stretch of coast that seemed like it had been almost abandoned to nature. We were chased by a pack of feral dogs and I fell off my bike. I didn\u2019t mind, though. We just laughed, as we\u2019d done all holiday.

It feels like being on another planet. A planet with a volcanic landscape, black sand beaches and steaming geysers. It also feels distinctly different in terms of its culture and food.</p> <p>Despite freezing temperatures, people here love ice-cream \u2013 we even discovered a shop in the town of Akureyri that was open until midnight. People also love swimming in the cold sea. We didn\u2019t try this, but we did swim in the Silfra fissure \u2013 between the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates in Lake \u00deingvallavatn.</p> <p>We wore dry suits \u2013 the water is around 2C! But once I was in I got distracted by the incredible views and didn\u2019t notice the cold. I floated in the dry suit, and the current gently moved me right through the rift. The water was crystal clear, so I could see everything \u2013 both sides of the tectonic plates, beautiful rock formations and plant life. I never thought that being in a dry suit in freezing water would be peaceful, but it was exactly that. It was so quiet and the blueish green hue of everything was very calming.</p> <p>Many people in Iceland have outdoor hot tubs too, which are cheaper to heat thanks to geothermal energy. This has also led to Iceland creating its own unique bread called <em>hverabrau\u00f0</em> (volcanic bread). It\u2019s non-yeasted, but unlike most British tea loaves the dough is enclosed in a well sealed metal pot, buried underground and baked for over 24 hours using the natural heat from the ground.</p> <p>We visited an underground bakery in the Lake Myvatn area. Being a baker, this was one of my highlights of the trip. We didn\u2019t get a chance to make any, but we did visit several cafes to try some. I loved the taste \u2013 full of dark rye, wholemeal flours, plus golden syrup to offset the bitter grains. It\u2019s very rich and flavoursome. I had mine served with butter and soup \u2013 another thing that Icelandic people love.

And while the weather may be as unpredictable as Donald Trump\u2019s tweets, the warmth of the people and breathtaking west coast scenery await you around every bend.</p> <p>I left my beloved Glasgow in 1992 for what was meant to be three months in London. Three months became three decades: children were born, London lives were led and Glasgow felt each and every one of those 500 miles away. Yet still, I knew I would return. I had a plan: one day I would find a wee ramshackle place up on the west coast, grow vegetables and raise pigs. So, when I think about holidays, for me it is so much more than a fortnight of fun; it\u2019s my future.</p> <p>My perfect break means a drive up the west coast of Scotland, past Loch Lomond and beyond Glencoe, heading for the incredible Isle of Skye.</p> <p>The island takes it name from ancient Norse, meaning \u201cisle of cloud\u201d for its mist-crowned mountains and hills. Overhead, a big, bold, beautiful sky. Ahead, ever-changing, dramatic vistas. One minute silken moors, then jagged mountains, followed by sheer sea cliffs.</p> <p>If you have yet to visit, my best advice is to practise not being able to breathe.

The first time I visited was for work experience as part of my postgraduate course in newspaper journalism. I went to Edinburgh, celebrated Hogmanay and marvelled at just how cold it was compared with London. Still, I loved the energy and vibe of the place, and the big sky. For the past six or seven years I have taken a break there annually, to play golf and, more importantly, to feel more free.</p> <p>In fact, by the end of the summer I\u2019ll have been four times this year alone. The most recent was a dream golfing holiday with my husband. We started with friends in the Borders, near the village of Cardrona, then hopped over to the Isle of Islay to play at Machrie. Within minutes of sitting outside in the sunshine \u2013 yes we always get good weather when we go to Scotland! \u2013 I felt so relaxed. To be honest, we did have one day of inclement weather, but it was so beautiful on the beach that we went for a two-hour walk in the warm rain and revelled in getting drenched as we soaked up the endless dramatic views.</p> <p>A whirlwind tour of amazing golf courses and cities followed. And the whisky flowed. I\u2019ve previously always shied away from that particular tipple. Now though, with a little bit of help from my Scottish friends, I have been won round to the non-peaty types \u2013 and there are so many: with beautiful clear, clean water on tap, why wouldn\u2019t there be? I\u2019m always surprised when I meet people from England who have never been \u2013 it\u2019s so close. Even when it\u2019s cold, it\u2019s one of the warmest places on Earth because the Scots are simply lovely.

It was an amazing location in the south, inland from Unawatuna, which is near Galle. The house is about five miles from the beach, up a big hill and surrounded by trees.</p> <p>It felt as though it was in the middle of the jungle. Just as it was getting dark each day, the monkeys would come swinging through the trees and stop for a minute. They\u2019d look at us, we\u2019d look at them, and they\u2019d be on their way. It was on the first day that I proposed to her, surrounded by candles and fairy lights under the pergola. The ring was burning a hole in my pocket. I was really nervous. So I had about six beers, got down on one knee ... and she said yes. After that we relaxed at the house a lot, and hung out with Frank, the most chilled-out dog ever.</p> <p>We went to the beach and visited a wood-carving workshop, where a man had been making statues of elephants for over 30 years. We also went to the local markets in Galle. They were colourful and super-vibrant, and had pretty much everything you could imagine food-wise. We ate curry for a week.

She was my grandad\u2019s sister, a tiny Greek-Cypriot woman with a huge sprawling house and a generosity to match. She had a secret walled garden filled with fruit trees, a well and two geese, Charlie and Geraldine, who would chase me around the garden. I\u2019m not sure who made more noise, me or the geese, but Helen would appear at the back door, waving a tea towel at us to signal that we were interrupting her peace.</p> <p>Dinner was always a communal, enormous affair. A dozen assorted cousins and relatives would sit around a table heaving with <em>koupepia (</em>stuffed vine leaves), roast chicken, salt-and-pepper potatoes, fat marrows cooked in plum tomatoes and olive oil, and sticky juicy plums from the garden. I would sit in her galley-kitchen, built into the conservatory with a glass roof and a vine growing up the inside, as her aged fingers deftly peeled potatoes and rolled koupepia. I\u2019d watch as she sat in her large wicker chair crocheting the heavy blankets that would keep us snug at night.</p> <p>Auntie Helen passed away several years ago now, and a photograph of her with her precious geese sits in my kitchen. When I grow up, I\u2019d like my family, no matter how loosely attached, to have the same memories of hospitality, endless dinners and a perpetually open door. If I could relive one holiday for the rest of my life, it would be those carefree summers of my childhood, roast potato sandwiches with lukewarm <em>avgolemono</em> soup, and a cup of tea snuck upstairs to bed by an elderly Greek goddess, with a heart as deep and beautiful as the Mediterranean Sea.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Tin Can Cook: 75 Simple Store-cupboard Recipes by Jack Monroe is out now, and available for \u00a36.15 at <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/tin-can-cook-9781529015287.html\">guardianbookshop.com</a></em></p> <p><strong>Looking for a holiday with a difference?

      "bodyText": "Leanne Best, actor A Rockie ride, Colorado I was tired. Really tired. It had been a while since I\u2019d taken a break for more than a long weekend. I wanted to see a big sky. And horses. I hadn\u2019t been on a horse since I was a kid and had no idea what I would do with one when I found it, but that was the plan. That was it. Big sky. Horse. I settled on Colorado. You can swing between beautiful towns like Lyon, Loveland and Boulder, and smaller places with family-owned ranches along the way. For a girl from Walton Vale in Liverpool, names like Eagle Rock and Crested Butte leapt off the page and reignited a childhood fascination with the culture and history of the West. I hadn\u2019t given it much thought before I got there, but to my relief, I discovered I still loved to ride. Being around the animals was restorative. I kicked around, travelling from place to place, and picked up trail rides along the foothills of the Rockies, often by word of mouth. You can get around by shuttle bus or the Lyft car-sharing scheme if driving isn\u2019t for you. The landscape was breathtaking. Riding on trails through mountain ranges was easier than I\u2019d thought, bar a sore backside and a few mosquito bites. I stayed at the Sylvan Dale ranch (a family-owned business that has offered room, board and a cowgirl school for generations) and cabin-style places (Estes Lake Lodge was a cracker). I hiked the foothills, visited hot springs, camped out and hung out. There was everything and nothing to do. I spent almost as much time reading in coffee shops (Boulder\u2019s Pearl Street was boutique everything heaven) as I did in the saddle. I found my dream hat in a gas station on Route 36. I indulged my love of crystals at roadside gem and jewellery stores. It\u2019s important to check where traditional pieces are from, but it\u2019s fairly obvious which stores are authentic and have relationships with indigenous artists. I came away from the trip rested and invigorated in equal measure. Even though I didn\u2019t venture completely off road, I wandered far enough to have a fair few Cheryl Strayed moments that will stay with me forever. It\u2019s a place I hope to return to again and again. My own little piece of big sky. \u2022 Leanne Best appears in Carnival Row, on Amazon Prime Video from 30 August Simon Reeve, author and TV presenter Spaced out in Copenhagen I went on holiday with my mates in our early 20s. We thought we were going somewhere hot. I\u2019m not sure who was to blame, but we arrived for our flight and discovered somebody had booked us a trip to Copenhagen. Four of the guys only had shorts, one had flip-flops, and none of us had a guidebook. When we arrived it was bitterly cold, so we went to an army surplus store and bought some long, heavy, 1970s grey coats for about a fiver. We looked like escaped prisoners of war. The only thing we could really do in that situation \u2013 being youthful and fairly inexperienced at life and travel \u2013 was to get very drunk. One bar, Woodstock, which I\u2019ve since been to as a more sober older person, was like something from Star Wars in an off-world colony \u2013 particularly after a couple of hash cakes. It was in Christiania, the anarchic, free-love area. One of the guys decided to ring his ex-girlfriend, who was working on the \u00d6resund bridge and tunnel project, connecting Denmark with Sweden. She took this group of drunk British men down to the tunnel, a building site at the time. We were in hard hats and tripping. There were lights coming at us \u2013 and me and a mate got it into our heads that there were aliens attacking, so we ran out of an emergency exit and security was called. They had to stop construction, but decided not to press charges. That\u2019s what I think holidays should be about \u2013 not a vanilla-beige experience but a memorable one. Bonding over weirdness and adversity is a wonderful thing to do. Obviously I want people to have deeper experiences and have their eyes opened. But I also think it\u2019s OK to have a weird experience \u2013 and a hash cake \u2013 with your mates. \u2022 Step By Step by Simon Reeve is published in paperback this week, available for \u00a38.79 from guardianbookshop.com Ruby Wax, comedian and writer Seduced by Brazil After I first saw pictures of Trancoso, near Porto Seguro in the state of Bahia, Brazil, I fantasised about it for over a decade. I finally visited two years ago. From S\u00e3o Paulo, you have to take a internal flight, then a two-hour drive along a dirt road. All around the Quadrado, the main square with its church, there\u2019s a real sense of community. There\u2019s football, weddings, funerals, rituals \u2026 there\u2019s even a horse that wanders in and out of bars. All you need do is sit in the cafes looking out and you\u2019ll see life. Suddenly a coffin will go by in the back of a Chevrolet, and everyone\u2019s singing. At night, all the trees sparkle with little lights and people open up the front of their homes as bars, sitting there with their chickens. As you go by, someone will grab you and do the samba. In the next bar there\u2019s capoeira (the Afro-Brazilian martial art that\u2019s like ballet). It\u2019s not a place that\u2019s locked in tradition, it\u2019s playing with tradition. There\u2019s one ritual where everyone dresses in white and they take a long pole and shove it through the window of the person they feel is the most fertile. I travel a lot, but Trancoso is a Dal\u00ed painting. Every house around the Quadrado is a different, blindingly bright colour: turquoise, fuchsia, lime. Inside, there are carved native masks with tribal feathers and religious icons lit up with fairy lights, all mixed with modern elements. The back of the Quadrado drops off to the ocean, and it\u2019s surrounded by the sexiest jungle I\u2019ve ever seen, with lots of exotic birds. People live in the jungle and there are indigenous tribes who\u2019ll invite you to their villages. It\u2019s a neighbourhood, and it\u2019s inclusive. My favourite hotel in the world is here \u2013 Uxua, where everything is made out of natural materials \u2013 even the sinks are in hollowed-out tree trunks. There are a lot of backpacker places, too. I became friends with someone who was about 20, an artist. We didn\u2019t speak the same language but would dance together at night \u2013 and we wept when we had to say goodbye. \u2022 Ruby Wax: How to be Human is at the Pleasance Grand, Edinburgh, from 18-24 August, then touring the UK until 30 November Marcus Brigstocke, comedian Laughter in the Alps Every year for the past decade we\u2019ve been skiing in Mayrhofen in Austria. It has a nice mix of easy slopes, a few challenging fast runs and some excellent off-piste. The Tirol has flat valley bottoms with spectacular cliff faces on either side. You can ski or snowboard for miles, ending up at the top of the valley in very remote and beautiful spots. On several occasions I\u2019ve got lost and had to find a ride back to town. One year, Rachel (now my fiancee) and I went walking and found a tiny church perched on a rock. It had some of the grisliest depictions of Christ\u2019s end that I\u2019ve ever seen \u2013 weird and interesting. Strictly speaking, because we go for the Altitude Comedy Festival, it\u2019s a \u201cwork trip\u201d, but it feels like a holiday to me. It\u2019s a bunch of comedians up a mountain making people howl with laughter. The apr\u00e8s-ski gigs start around 5pm and go on until late. It\u2019s a pretty resort and it turns out that the straightforward, plain-speaking, efficient Austrians are also daft, funny and generous. They also like meat. Pork mostly but meat in general. It\u2019s all a bit fleshy if you\u2019re a vegetarian. Particularly the spa, I suppose. They insist that you spa naked \u2013 so if you want to see comedians having the time of their lives on stage and on skis, but also wonder what they look like naked, this is the place. \u2022 Marcus is writer/director of The Red, at the Edinburgh Festival until 26 August Deborah Frances-White, comedian and writer On the juice in Portugal At the beginning of last year, when it was clear I had already spent the advance for my book, The Guilty Feminist, before I\u2019d finished writing it, each new (over-optimistic) deadline haunted every moment of my fretful sleep. So I went on \u201choliday\u201d to a juice-only retreat up a mountain near Rio Cimeiro in Portugal. A friend overcome by a similar anxiety-inducing writing challenge swore that, taken exclusively, juice is \u201ccocaine for healthy people\u201d. Here are some excerpts from my diary \u2026 Day one: A perky woman called Tamara gives us juice and says: \u201cYour friends all think you\u2019re mad coming on this, don\u2019t they?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d we reply, mystified. \u201cWell, they\u2019re probably saying it behind your back. But you\u2019re not mad. Don\u2019t listen to them. They think it\u2019s a cult. It\u2019s not a cult. Repeat after me: Your friends think you\u2019re mad but you\u2019re not in a cult.\u201d Day two: I am overcome with a crippling headache. Not only can I not write my book, I cannot hold my head up or look directly at light. Tamara claims it\u2019s caffeine withdrawals. I believe it to be \u201ceverything withdrawals\u201d. She recommends napping in a \u201cwomb basket\u201d or a caffeinated colonic irrigation. I cling to the womb basket with both hands. Day three: I am dying. Tamara tells me I can have one official juice-based power bar. I have three. I see now there can be no book-writing without food. There is no food. There is no way off the mountain. Day four: I wake up at 3am like a meerkat on amphetamines. I write for four days straight, like Jack Nicholson in The Shining except all the words are different and in a very pleasing order. I need to run each day to burn off the excess energy. I now believe myself to be only two-thirds human and one-third Black Mirror app. Day seven: The mountain is spectacular. The air is bracing. The book is finished. Tamara schools us in hosting a party for our friends back home. The theme of the party is: \u201cJuice is Good and This is Not a Cult\u201d. I\u2019m converted. Juice is good. This is definitely not a cult. I am tempted to throw such a party. Day eight: I\u2019m home. I remember bread. \u2022 Deborah Frances-White hosts The Secret Policeman\u2019s Tour at Edinburgh Playhouse on 24 August. The Guilty Feminist is available for \u00a37.91 from guardianbookshop.com Candice Carty-Williams, author Three go mad in Lisbon The first holiday I went on after a pretty major depressive episode in my twenties was to Lisbon. Me and Hannah, one of my best friends, went to stay with another best friend, Morwenna, who was teaching abroad for a year. I\u2019d barely left the house in two years, but as a determined person I forced myself to go. In the five days of laughter, faffing and catching up on who\u2019d done what, and with whom, we visited a castle, Castela de S\u00e3o Jorge, one of the highest points of the city, each ate at least 100 pasteis de nata (Portugal\u2019s famous custard tarts), and stayed up dancing in a nightclub, Esquina da Bica, that to the untrained eye looked like someone\u2019s house. Sitting in a sunny square writing postcards to everyone back home, I was reminded of who I was when I wasn\u2019t trapped in my bedroom in Lewisham. None of my predictions of panic attacks or Candice-imposed drama came true. The only mini-drama came when we hired bikes and took the ferry over to Costa da Caparica, a quiet, pretty stretch of coast that seemed like it had been almost abandoned to nature. We were chased by a pack of feral dogs and I fell off my bike. I didn\u2019t mind, though. We just laughed, as we\u2019d done all holiday. I was out of the house, I was with my best friends, and I remembered what it felt like to be happy. \u2022 Candice Carty-Williams\u2019s novel, Queenie, is available from guardianbookshop.com for \u00a39.99 inc UK p&amp;p Kim-Joy, baker On another planet, Iceland Iceland is one of my favourite places, because it is so different from anywhere else. It feels like being on another planet. A planet with a volcanic landscape, black sand beaches and steaming geysers. It also feels distinctly different in terms of its culture and food. Despite freezing temperatures, people here love ice-cream \u2013 we even discovered a shop in the town of Akureyri that was open until midnight. People also love swimming in the cold sea. We didn\u2019t try this, but we did swim in the Silfra fissure \u2013 between the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates in Lake \u00deingvallavatn. We wore dry suits \u2013 the water is around 2C! But once I was in I got distracted by the incredible views and didn\u2019t notice the cold. I floated in the dry suit, and the current gently moved me right through the rift. The water was crystal clear, so I could see everything \u2013 both sides of the tectonic plates, beautiful rock formations and plant life. I never thought that being in a dry suit in freezing water would be peaceful, but it was exactly that. It was so quiet and the blueish green hue of everything was very calming. Many people in Iceland have outdoor hot tubs too, which are cheaper to heat thanks to geothermal energy. This has also led to Iceland creating its own unique bread called hverabrau\u00f0 (volcanic bread). It\u2019s non-yeasted, but unlike most British tea loaves the dough is enclosed in a well sealed metal pot, buried underground and baked for over 24 hours using the natural heat from the ground. We visited an underground bakery in the Lake Myvatn area. Being a baker, this was one of my highlights of the trip. We didn\u2019t get a chance to make any, but we did visit several cafes to try some. I loved the taste \u2013 full of dark rye, wholemeal flours, plus golden syrup to offset the bitter grains. It\u2019s very rich and flavoursome. I had mine served with butter and soup \u2013 another thing that Icelandic people love. It was delicious. \u2022 Baking with Kim-Joy: Cute and Creative Bakes to Make You Smile, is published by Quadrille on 22 August and available for \u00a315.84 from guardianbookshop.com Hardeep Singh Kohli, comedian Reach for the Skye While the younger Hardeep might have sought holiday haven in the bright lights of Brooklyn or medinas of Marrakech, the greyer, hopefully wiser version of me has come to realise that Scotland is the most beautiful country in the world. And while the weather may be as unpredictable as Donald Trump\u2019s tweets, the warmth of the people and breathtaking west coast scenery await you around every bend. I left my beloved Glasgow in 1992 for what was meant to be three months in London. Three months became three decades: children were born, London lives were led and Glasgow felt each and every one of those 500 miles away. Yet still, I knew I would return. I had a plan: one day I would find a wee ramshackle place up on the west coast, grow vegetables and raise pigs. So, when I think about holidays, for me it is so much more than a fortnight of fun; it\u2019s my future. My perfect break means a drive up the west coast of Scotland, past Loch Lomond and beyond Glencoe, heading for the incredible Isle of Skye. The island takes it name from ancient Norse, meaning \u201cisle of cloud\u201d for its mist-crowned mountains and hills. Overhead, a big, bold, beautiful sky. Ahead, ever-changing, dramatic vistas. One minute silken moors, then jagged mountains, followed by sheer sea cliffs. If you have yet to visit, my best advice is to practise not being able to breathe. The scenery and the wild nature of Skye will take your breath away \u2013 repeatedly. \u2022 Hardeep Singh Kohli\u2019s Edinburgh show, It\u2019s Hard to Be Deep, is on at the Assembly, until 24 August Naga Munchetty, BBC Breakfast presenter Tees and tipples, Scotland When I drive north and see the sign \u201cWelcome to Scotland\u201d, my shoulders relax, I breathe a little deeper and I can\u2019t help but smile. The first time I visited was for work experience as part of my postgraduate course in newspaper journalism. I went to Edinburgh, celebrated Hogmanay and marvelled at just how cold it was compared with London. Still, I loved the energy and vibe of the place, and the big sky. For the past six or seven years I have taken a break there annually, to play golf and, more importantly, to feel more free. In fact, by the end of the summer I\u2019ll have been four times this year alone. The most recent was a dream golfing holiday with my husband. We started with friends in the Borders, near the village of Cardrona, then hopped over to the Isle of Islay to play at Machrie. Within minutes of sitting outside in the sunshine \u2013 yes we always get good weather when we go to Scotland! \u2013 I felt so relaxed. To be honest, we did have one day of inclement weather, but it was so beautiful on the beach that we went for a two-hour walk in the warm rain and revelled in getting drenched as we soaked up the endless dramatic views. A whirlwind tour of amazing golf courses and cities followed. And the whisky flowed. I\u2019ve previously always shied away from that particular tipple. Now though, with a little bit of help from my Scottish friends, I have been won round to the non-peaty types \u2013 and there are so many: with beautiful clear, clean water on tap, why wouldn\u2019t there be? I\u2019m always surprised when I meet people from England who have never been \u2013 it\u2019s so close. Even when it\u2019s cold, it\u2019s one of the warmest places on Earth because the Scots are simply lovely. Belly laughs and great grub \u2026 don\u2019t get me started on the seafood. Tom Walker, singer-songwriter On one knee in Sri Lanka Our friend owns a house in Sri Lanka, and when I mentioned that I wanted to propose to my girlfriend, he offered it to us for a week last August. It was an amazing location in the south, inland from Unawatuna, which is near Galle. The house is about five miles from the beach, up a big hill and surrounded by trees. It felt as though it was in the middle of the jungle. Just as it was getting dark each day, the monkeys would come swinging through the trees and stop for a minute. They\u2019d look at us, we\u2019d look at them, and they\u2019d be on their way. It was on the first day that I proposed to her, surrounded by candles and fairy lights under the pergola. The ring was burning a hole in my pocket. I was really nervous. So I had about six beers, got down on one knee ... and she said yes. After that we relaxed at the house a lot, and hung out with Frank, the most chilled-out dog ever. We went to the beach and visited a wood-carving workshop, where a man had been making statues of elephants for over 30 years. We also went to the local markets in Galle. They were colourful and super-vibrant, and had pretty much everything you could imagine food-wise. We ate curry for a week. It was full of fresh flavours, like pineapples and sweet potatoes ... the best curry I\u2019ve ever eaten. \u2022 Tom\u2019s Walker\u2019s latest album is What a Time to Be Alive. His current world tour includes UK dates in October/November Jack Monroe, food writer and activist A family feast in Plymouth When I was a young girl, every summer we would take a trip to my Auntie Helen\u2019s in Plymouth. She was my grandad\u2019s sister, a tiny Greek-Cypriot woman with a huge sprawling house and a generosity to match. She had a secret walled garden filled with fruit trees, a well and two geese, Charlie and Geraldine, who would chase me around the garden. I\u2019m not sure who made more noise, me or the geese, but Helen would appear at the back door, waving a tea towel at us to signal that we were interrupting her peace. Dinner was always a communal, enormous affair. A dozen assorted cousins and relatives would sit around a table heaving with koupepia (stuffed vine leaves), roast chicken, salt-and-pepper potatoes, fat marrows cooked in plum tomatoes and olive oil, and sticky juicy plums from the garden. I would sit in her galley-kitchen, built into the conservatory with a glass roof and a vine growing up the inside, as her aged fingers deftly peeled potatoes and rolled koupepia. I\u2019d watch as she sat in her large wicker chair crocheting the heavy blankets that would keep us snug at night. Auntie Helen passed away several years ago now, and a photograph of her with her precious geese sits in my kitchen. When I grow up, I\u2019d like my family, no matter how loosely attached, to have the same memories of hospitality, endless dinners and a perpetually open door. If I could relive one holiday for the rest of my life, it would be those carefree summers of my childhood, roast potato sandwiches with lukewarm avgolemono soup, and a cup of tea snuck upstairs to bed by an elderly Greek goddess, with a heart as deep and beautiful as the Mediterranean Sea. \u2022 Tin Can Cook: 75 Simple Store-cupboard Recipes by Jack Monroe is out now, and available for \u00a36.15 at guardianbookshop.com Looking for a holiday with a difference?

      "body": "<p>There is a story that often gets told about modern presidents and prime ministers, and sometimes gets told by them as well. The politician spends half a lifetime working tirelessly towards the top job, with the goal of making a real difference once he or she gets there. They issue their instructions. Dutiful officials nod along encouragingly. But nothing really changes. Once the door to the Oval Office or No 10 closes behind them, and they settle their feet under the desk, the new president or prime minister finds out that it\u2019s just another room and just another desk. It feels as if true power is still somewhere out of reach.</p> <p>In politics you should never assume that there is a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. It\u2019s better to know how little is waiting for you, like a weird inversion of the parable of <em>The<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/03/wizard-of-oz-donald-trump-united-states\" title=\"\"> Wizard of Oz</a></em>. In place of the Yellow Brick Road is the greasy pole, which has to be ascended to reach the Emerald City. Yet the successful climber finds that his or her fate is not to encounter a shrunken wizard at the end of it. Instead it is to become that person: the impostor behind the curtain.</p> <p>How do politicians react when they discover themselves in that position? Some, like George W Bush, never quite acknowledge it. Others, like Tony Blair, decide to do something about it. Blair concluded that he had to build the machinery that would enable his administration to deliver on its ambitions. He called this instrument<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2014/jul/09/no-10-policy-blair-cameron-government\" title=\"\"> \u201cthe delivery unit\u201d</a>. It was designed to make sure that the levers in Downing Street were connected to the rest of government. Yet even after 10 years in power, Blair was frustrated with how little he had managed to achieve. One reason he was reluctant to leave office at the end was a nagging feeling that he was only just beginning to get the hang of it.</p> <p>Real power still felt out of reach, somewhere over the horizon. Since quitting frontline politics, Blair has made himself into a salesman for the idea of \u201cDeliverology\u201d, which promises to help politicians around the world with the problem of actually getting things done. It\u2019s a pretty threadbare prospectus. Perma-tanned and increasingly wizened, Blair cuts a tawdry figure these days. Here is another version of the morality tale: the wizard has spent so long behind the curtain that he doesn\u2019t realise how diminished he appears when he steps out in front.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Despite her reputation for knowing her own mind, Thatcher was surprisingly fragile in her confidence and scatty in her convictions</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There are other ways of responding to the deficit of power at the summit of politics. The truly paranoid politician believes that the reason the levers are not working is that someone has cut the strings. Faced with the frustrations of office, it is always tempting to imagine that there is a conspiracy at work to prevent meaningful change. Blame it on the \u201cdeep state\u201d \u2013 or, in the politer British version, on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/07/yes-minister-brexit-eu-jonathan-lynn-sir-humphrey\" title=\"\">\u201cSir Humphrey\u201d</a>. Probably no one is immune from this suspicion, especially in the long reaches of the night. Most politicians have had moments when they believed that dark forces were at work to prevent them getting their way. But only one has turned this belief into his governing philosophy. Donald Trump\u2019s response to any setback is to claim that he is the victim of a deliberate attempt to subvert his authority. He cannot accept that there are inherent limits to the power of his office. So any manifestations of those limits become further evidence of the conspiracy against him. These are the dangers of electing a narcissist to an office that is not as powerful as it seems.</p> <p>That said, it is not true that none of the levers work. Some do, all too well. Another temptation is to keep pulling until you find one that produces a direct response. Inevitably, for both presidents and prime ministers, this tends to be the lever that links to the armed forces. Again, Blair is emblematic here, but he is far from unusual. Chastened by his inability to get traction with his domestic agenda, Blair latched gratefully on to the opportunity presented by 9/11 to turn himself into a player on the international stage. It wasn\u2019t just that he wanted to put the world to rights according to his own lights. It was also that he was able to do so, more easily than he could put his own government right, because the instrument to hand was military force. The same was true of Bush. But it has equally been true of politicians as otherwise different from each other as Margaret Thatcher and Bill Clinton, Barack Obama and Donald Trump. The power of the office they hold is least constrained when it comes to taking action abroad. That is why presidents and PMs, who almost never get elected on a foreign policy platform, often find that foreign policy is what ends up defining their tenure at the top. The international arena is where they can make the biggest difference, for better or for worse.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3b341ca1f7a03d1c0d78a166d981ada950e7de8e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b341ca1f7a03d1c0d78a166d981ada950e7de8e/0_79_2048_1228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George W Bush and Tony Blair at Camp David in 2001.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George W Bush and Tony Blair at Camp David in 2001.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The trauma of 9/11 \u2013 and what followed \u2013 reveals another fundamental truth. The power of presidents and prime ministers is hugely dependent on the accidents of history. For <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/apr/01/falklands-war-thatcher-30-years\" title=\"\">Margaret Thatcher, the Falklands war </a>completely altered what it was possible for her to achieve in office. Without Argentina\u2019s invasion of April 1982, over which she had no control, her premiership would have been very different. For <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/feb/21/gordon-brown-saved-banks\" title=\"\">Gordon Brown, the financial crisis of 2007\u20138 </a>reconfigured what he could accomplish, as it did for<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/17/goodbye-barack-hussein-obama-americas-first-muslim-president\" title=\"\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/17/goodbye-barack-hussein-obama-americas-first-muslim-president\" title=\"\">Obama\u2019s presidency</a>. Such unforeseen events do not suddenly endow presidents and prime ministers with superpowers: the frustrations of trying to get things done remain just as intense (as both Brown and Obama discovered). But they do provide an opportunity to break out of a rut.</p> <p>It helps to arrive in office knowing who you are. Obama, always poised and self-contained, knew his own worth full well. Yet he accomplished less as a result, because he never really pushed the limits of what he could achieve. Thatcher, despite her reputation for knowing her own mind, was surprisingly fragile in her confidence and scatty in her convictions. Yet she understood, with an almost uncanny instinct, what someone with her personality could achieve as prime minister, especially when the occasion arose. Blair was far more self-confident and sure of what he believed than Thatcher was. But it did him little good. He persisted in trying to make the office of PM suit his convictions, rather than trying to adapt those convictions to the limits of what the office made possible.<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/dec/21/biography.features\" title=\"\"> Bill Clinton </a>was perhaps the most intelligent man ever to occupy the Oval Office. His mind was voracious in its appetite for new information and fresh insights. It was too much. He couldn\u2019t contain the intelligence he had within the space of the role he occupied. It spilled out, and too often it went nowhere.</p> <p>It is sometimes said that it doesn\u2019t do for a president or prime minister to be too smart: a second-class mind is more likely to make for a first-class leader. Like many such generalisations about politics, there\u2019s some truth to it, but also plenty that it misses. There are lots of different ways for a politician to be intelligent, and there are many things that politicians can know which are unknown to anyone on the outside. What matters is whether they know what it is that they know. And if they do, whether they understand what that knowledge is good for.</p> <p><strong>\u00b6</strong></p> <p>This brings us to Trump, who in many ways exemplifies the idea that the personality of the politician reveals the character of the office he occupies. His persona is not going to change. He is disturbingly consistent in what he has always been: showman, chauvinist, charlatan. What he is doing is testing how far a man like that is able to push the boundaries of what a president can be. He has been more successful than many people believed was possible. His willingness to say anything \u2013 and possibly to believe anything \u2013 in order to get his way turns out to be a surprisingly effective means of maximising his authority. Given that a majority of Americans revile him, he has done quite a lot with the limited power he has. Perhaps he too bucks the fable of <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>. He simply refuses to acknowledge the existence of the curtain. He wants people to see!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b3cfcb9b69c9737049ee559ae1898647461a3b30\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3cfcb9b69c9737049ee559ae1898647461a3b30/0_299_4800_2880/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump in Cincinnati, Ohio.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump in Cincinnati, Ohio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Spear/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What makes Trump so unnerving, however, is his seeming lack of any self-knowledge. He is not really probing for the limits of what the presidency allows, because that would require him to accept that there are limits. He does what he does regardless. Trump is both more and less than a president should be. More, because he is behaving as though his power were truly as he believes it to be. Less, because he is also behaving as though the presidency were just another job (businessman, reality TV host). Much of the time he does not seem to appreciate where he is. Why would someone whose personality is so fixed be so unpredictable in office? Because that personality makes him incapable of seeing the presidency as its previous occupants have seen it, as an office that comes with certain expectations of how to behave. Trump is, in institutional terms, unhinged.</p> <p>Does that mean he is mentally unfit to be president? During his time in the White House Trump has been dogged by repeated rumours about his intellectual incapacity \u2013 he has been variously described as a \u201cfucking moron\u201d, \u201clike an 11-year-old child\u201d, a \u201cdope\u201d, an \u201cidiot\u201d and \u201cdumb as shit\u201d. And that\u2019s just how his former aides and colleagues speak about him. Plenty of psychiatrists have pushed back hard against the so-called \u201cGoldwater rule\u201d, which prevents them from diagnosing the psychological failings of public figures at second hand. For many, this injunction bars them from simply stating the obvious: Trump is out of his mind.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>While in the White House Trump has\u00a0been dogged by repeated rumours about his intell\u00adectual incapacity</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But we should be wary of assuming that this is enough to place Trump beyond the pale of conventional political leadership. Blair was widely thought to have lost his mental bearings during and after the Iraq war. Brown was pursued by stories of titanic rages and prolonged depressions. I have spoken to people who believe that the true story of Theresa May\u2019s premiership has been suppressed, that as a type-1 diabetic she faces cognitive handicaps, including an inability either to process new information or to change her mind.<strong> </strong>These kinds of accusations come with the territory: presidents and prime ministers are often thought to be psychologically undone by office. It is one of the ways we express our discomfort with anyone aspiring to that kind of power.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2009/jul/08/new-york-times\" title=\"\">Max Weber</a>, writing 100 years ago, made the case that the risk of madness is not simply an accidental byproduct of high office. It is an essential part of it: a feature, not a bug. Presidents and prime ministers have to deal with the mental strain of bearing enormous political responsibility without necessarily having the personal authority to match. The leaders of modern states hold the lives of millions in their hands, and yet they often can\u2019t even get the people in the next room to do what they want. It might make anyone a little crazy. Leadership is a constant tug of war between the rules of political accountability and the law of unintended consequences. That has not changed in the time since Weber wrote. One reason it is so hard to be a president or a prime minister is that the voters hold the wizard responsible for what happens. Even though the wizard is just the impostor behind the curtain.</p> <p>By far the sanest president or prime minister of recent times was Obama. He went out of his way to maintain an even keel, even in the face of the most outrageous provocation. He made sure that he stayed connected with his family and that he got enough downtime. Is it possible to be too sane for the presidency? Certainly there were moments when Obama\u2019s insistence on keeping his cool looked like a missed opportunity. Sometimes one longed to see him let rip. But that was not his style. Nor was it what got him elected.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"286919a99f11f97f272d7ac4011f0bf7fac4b948\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/286919a99f11f97f272d7ac4011f0bf7fac4b948/0_0_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Obama and Clinton pictured in 2008.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Obama and Clinton pictured in 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michal Czerwonka/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is the other deep tension that resides in the character of anyone who pursues the highest office. The personality traits that can win you the crucial election may not be the ones that suit the role to which you have been elected. Campaigning, as the slogan goes, is not governing. Obama the candidate was known to his inner circle as \u201c\u2018No drama\u2019 Obama\u201d. During his long, bruising, underdog campaign in 2008 to wrest the Democratic nomination from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/26/hillary-clinton-presidential-nomination-democratic-convention\" title=\"\">Hillary Clinton</a>, and then for the duration of the shorter but equally high-wire act needed to win a general election that was taking place as the world economy was having a heart attack, his level temperament was a golden asset. Refusing to get ruffled got him over the line. But when he became president he needed other skills too. His preference for cool analysis over impulsive decision-making and his insistence that he would not be baited by his baying opponents \u2013 as his wife, Michelle, memorably said in 2016, \u201cwhen they go low, we go high\u201d \u2013 were still assets. But they were not enough.</p> <p>Personal development is very difficult over the course of a political career, especially when being who you are has made you what you have become. Why would political leaders whose approach to politics won them office abandon that approach once they get there? Trump stormed to the Republican nomination and ultimately the presidency in 2016 with a scorched earth campaign that recognised no limits and took no prisoners. He defeated his rivals by mocking them, belittling them and, when the opportunity arose, lying about them. That is how he has carried on conducting himself as president, to continuing howls of outrage from his opponents. But who is to say he is wrong? If high office doesn\u2019t change who politicians really are, we shouldn\u2019t expect them to change how it makes them behave.</p> <p>Some politicians reach the top without having to win an election to get there. When May faced a general election in 2017, by choice rather than by necessity, the skill set that had got her to Downing Street let her down. The tenacious, colourless, undeviating politician who tiptoed over the corpses to inherit the crown in the aftermath of the Brexit vote morphed on the campaign trail into<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jul/10/making-maybot-theresa-may-rise-and-fall\" title=\"\"> the deathless Maybot</a>: cold, mechanical and seemingly without a personality of her own. On the stump, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/10/jeremy-corbyn-youth-surge-votes-digital-activists\" title=\"\">Jeremy Corbyn</a>, a politician for whom campaigning has been the lifeblood of his entire career, ran rings round her.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Qualities that we once appreciated can become loathed: Blair\u2019s sincerity came to seem like sanctimony, while Obama\u2019s coolness turned into aloofness</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Change is hard for politicians. But what makes political leadership so precarious is that it is relatively easy for voters. If we get tired of our politicians, we can get rid of them. The qualities that we once appreciated in a leader can turn surprisingly quickly into what we loathe about them. Blair\u2019s sincerity came to seem like sanctimony. Obama\u2019s coolness turned into aloofness. May\u2019s steadfastness made her come across like a robot. Sooner or later Corbyn\u2019s simplicity will come to appear like idiocy. Another truism of democratic life is that all political careers end in failure. Perhaps it would be easier to say that no political personality is built to last at the very top. The demands of the highest office are never set.</p> <p>Yet if there is one quality that is indispensable for anyone at or near the summit of political life, it is stamina. This does not have to be physical stamina, though that helps. Corbyn has a reputation for being a lazy politician. He rarely strays outside his comfort zone. But there has been nothing lazy about his political career. As a backbench MP he stuck it out for decades, even when he had very little to show for it. Corbyn hung in there, where others might have given up. As a result, he was still around when his chance came.</p> <p>The British and US political systems are different, so the kinds of chances they throw up for resilient politicians will be different too. The presidency is open to genuine outsiders in a way that the prime ministership is not. No one could reach No 10, as Trump reached the White House, without ever having stood for election before in any capacity. A presidential campaign, running over two or more years, with its relentless requirements for fundraising and attention-seeking, makes distinctive demands. It suits personalities as different as Obama\u2019s and Trump\u2019s \u2013 the one unflappable, the other unembarrassable. It would not suit May. British politics is more self-contained, its campaigns shorter and the role of its parliament in selecting political leaders much more pronounced. Corbyn, in turning Labour into a mass movement that downplays the role of its elected MPs, is as close to an outsider as British politics has ever had near its summit. Yet he has had no career outside parliament.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb553e946f55322e18e280e29c42a6bb8c5bb1ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb553e946f55322e18e280e29c42a6bb8c5bb1ee/0_273_2958_1775/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Displays of stamina \u2026 Jeremy Corbyn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Staying power \u2026 Jeremy Corbyn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darren Staples/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trump\u2019s stamina remains an underrated weapon in his political arsenal. He didn\u2019t just outfight his opponents in 2016, he outlasted them, withstanding setbacks that would have felled a less resilient candidate. His appetite for gruelling speaking engagements has not diminished since he won the presidency. In fact, he seems happiest when he is hammering away at the podium. He has chewed up and spat out a remarkable number of staffers in his relatively short political career. He seems to measure his political success in large part by the number of bodies he can pile up at his door, regardless of their prior allegiances. By that measure, he may be the most successful president in modern American history.</p> <p>What makes him different, though, is his willingness to turn his personal frustrations into the primary vehicle of his political programme. He is the Complainer-in-Chief. Winning the presidency did nothing to temper his feelings of grievance. If anything, it amplified them. All presidents and prime ministers have periods when they feel that they are victims, despite being the most powerful person in the land. Thatcher, Blair, Clinton, Brown, Obama and May certainly have had times of feeling sorry for themselves like that. But none of them made victimhood their raison d\u2019\u00eatre. They knew that such a move would be fatal to their political authority \u2013 the whining, preening egomaniac is not someone who can command the respect of the voters. And without respect the president or prime minister is surely lost. Yet Trump has shown, for now, that they were wrong.</p> <p>Ours is an age of populism. It is now the voters who are testing the limits of the power of presidents and prime ministers as much as it is the politicians themselves. Brexit and Trump have acted as a litmus test that reveals things that were previously hidden about the countries that produced them. We turn out to be divided in new ways \u2013 between old and young, educated and less educated, connected and disconnected \u2013 and often to be as angry with each other as we are with the people who govern us. The idea that it is the character of our political leaders that determines the character of our democracy now appears somewhat quaint. More, perhaps, than in the past, we get the politicians we deserve.</p> <p>Trump makes leadership more important than ever, and also increasingly irrelevant. The paradox of populist leaders is that they promise to empower the people but end up accumulating more and more power in their own hands. They undermine the authority of the democratic offices they hold at the same time as exaggerating it. They are not probing the limits of their own power: they are testing the limits of democracy itself.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>If Boris Johnson wants you to do something, he\u2019ll grab you by the arm. He's a charmer, a wheedler, a flatterer, a bully</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So where does <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/23/ambition-fulfilled-for-boris-johnson-but-what-next-for-britain\" title=\"\">Boris Johnson fit into this story of high ambition </a>and mismatched expectations? Johnson can have few illusions about the limits of the power of the office he now holds, given that his predecessor\u2019s tenure was a case study in exposing them. May arrived in Downing Street promising both to deliver Brexit and to remedy some of the social injustices that stoked the divisions which lay behind it. She failed to do either. Instead, she spent three years searching in vain for the tools that would get others to comply with her wishes. She couldn\u2019t find them, no matter how doggedly she looked. Calling a general election to supply the missing leverage over her colleagues in parliament only made the situation worse. Yet here is Johnson, making exactly the same promises and threatening exactly the same remedy: do as I say or the voters will tell you! It\u2019s as though the last three years never happened. What does he know that she didn\u2019t? What does he have that she lacked?</p> <p>It can\u2019t be true belief, which Brexiters sometimes say was the crucial ingredient missing from May\u2019s prime ministerial portfolio. Yes, she campaigned for remain whereas Johnson led for leave. But he is also the man who wrote two columns, one for each side of the question, each serviceable depending on which way he decided to jump. He is not a conviction politician. He is a jobbing journalist, for whom convictions are simply the touchpaper to ignite this week\u2019s copy.</p> <p>Nor can it be greater political experience or political skills. What Johnson does have is a certain bearish presence: he enjoys the rough and tumble of politics and has no problem with physical intimacy. If he wants you to do something, he\u2019ll grab you by the arm or pull you by the ear. He is a charmer, a wheedler, a flatterer and an occasional bully. Johnson appears to see these qualities as a substitute for hard work and a grasp of detail but he is not going to get his (or any other) version of Brexit through parliament by grappling his colleagues over the line.</p> <p>Perhaps the new prime minister thinks that he has finally assembled in Downing Street what Blair sought but never quite achieved: a delivery unit that can actually deliver. It\u2019s a one-man unit named <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/04/dominic-cummings-brilliant-eccentric-or-evil-genius-brexit-tv-drama-benedict-cumberbatch\" title=\"\">Dominic Cummings</a>, the man who delivered victory for Vote Leave in the referendum. However, winning the referendum is very different from delivering Brexit itself. Cummings may yet find a way to engineer another victory at the ballot box. But the bureaucratic grind of forging a lasting settlement looks beyond him. Johnson\u2019s delivery unit is in the business of getting him through the next few months. What happens after that is anyone\u2019s guess.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/26/dominic-cummings-a-career-psychopath-in-downing-street\">Dominic Cummings: master of the dark arts handed keys to No 10</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Johnson is behaving as though Brexit were just another foreign policy challenge, giving him the same licence his predecessors have sometimes enjoyed when taking on foreigners. This is international politics, so he doesn\u2019t see why he has to stand on ceremony. He can throw his weight around, unencumbered by democratic niceties. The May government, according to this version of events, was far too worried about creating the right impression. But Brexit is not just another foreign policy challenge. It is a legal, economic and diplomatic nightmare.</p> <p>No amount of sub-Churchillian rhetoric can change the fact that a successful exit strategy is almost entirely dependent on the goodwill of others, ranging from Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel to the Irish government and the European Commission, not to mention the foreign currency and bond markets. Treating it like a war doesn\u2019t make it one. It just makes it more likely that the limits of the power of the prime minister will once again be exposed.</p> <p>In the end, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the only game-changing asset Johnson has that his predecessor may have lacked is a willingness to embrace his inner Trump. What Johnson brings to the table is an appetite for creative destruction: not testing the limits of the office he holds but hoping to ignore them altogether. He is relying on energy, animal spirits and a disregard not just for the conventional wisdom but for the rules of the game to carry him through. If he succeeds, it will be a clear indication that the rules are indeed changing. The story of modern politics \u2013 of presidents and prime ministers frustrated by and chafing against the limits of their power \u2013 will have a new chapter.</p> <p>In many ways, Johnson is not Trump. He is more of a hybrid politician, whose character contains bits of the past that cling to him like debris from another age. He tries to ape Thatcherite resolve, Blairish charisma, Clintonian chutzpah about his personal indiscretions. But being Thatcher or Blair or Clinton won\u2019t get Johnson out of the Brexit mess that he helped to create and which he has now inherited. If he finds a way through it will be because his obvious weaknesses and his disregard for the truth turned out not to matter.

      "bodyText": "There is a story that often gets told about modern presidents and prime ministers, and sometimes gets told by them as well. The politician spends half a lifetime working tirelessly towards the top job, with the goal of making a real difference once he or she gets there. They issue their instructions. Dutiful officials nod along encouragingly. But nothing really changes. Once the door to the Oval Office or No 10 closes behind them, and they settle their feet under the desk, the new president or prime minister finds out that it\u2019s just another room and just another desk. It feels as if true power is still somewhere out of reach. In politics you should never assume that there is a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. It\u2019s better to know how little is waiting for you, like a weird inversion of the parable of The Wizard of Oz. In place of the Yellow Brick Road is the greasy pole, which has to be ascended to reach the Emerald City. Yet the successful climber finds that his or her fate is not to encounter a shrunken wizard at the end of it. Instead it is to become that person: the impostor behind the curtain. How do politicians react when they discover themselves in that position? Some, like George W Bush, never quite acknowledge it. Others, like Tony Blair, decide to do something about it. Blair concluded that he had to build the machinery that would enable his administration to deliver on its ambitions. He called this instrument \u201cthe delivery unit\u201d. It was designed to make sure that the levers in Downing Street were connected to the rest of government. Yet even after 10 years in power, Blair was frustrated with how little he had managed to achieve. One reason he was reluctant to leave office at the end was a nagging feeling that he was only just beginning to get the hang of it. Real power still felt out of reach, somewhere over the horizon. Since quitting frontline politics, Blair has made himself into a salesman for the idea of \u201cDeliverology\u201d, which promises to help politicians around the world with the problem of actually getting things done. It\u2019s a pretty threadbare prospectus. Perma-tanned and increasingly wizened, Blair cuts a tawdry figure these days. Here is another version of the morality tale: the wizard has spent so long behind the curtain that he doesn\u2019t realise how diminished he appears when he steps out in front. There are other ways of responding to the deficit of power at the summit of politics. The truly paranoid politician believes that the reason the levers are not working is that someone has cut the strings. Faced with the frustrations of office, it is always tempting to imagine that there is a conspiracy at work to prevent meaningful change. Blame it on the \u201cdeep state\u201d \u2013 or, in the politer British version, on \u201cSir Humphrey\u201d. Probably no one is immune from this suspicion, especially in the long reaches of the night. Most politicians have had moments when they believed that dark forces were at work to prevent them getting their way. But only one has turned this belief into his governing philosophy. Donald Trump\u2019s response to any setback is to claim that he is the victim of a deliberate attempt to subvert his authority. He cannot accept that there are inherent limits to the power of his office. So any manifestations of those limits become further evidence of the conspiracy against him. These are the dangers of electing a narcissist to an office that is not as powerful as it seems. That said, it is not true that none of the levers work. Some do, all too well. Another temptation is to keep pulling until you find one that produces a direct response. Inevitably, for both presidents and prime ministers, this tends to be the lever that links to the armed forces. Again, Blair is emblematic here, but he is far from unusual. Chastened by his inability to get traction with his domestic agenda, Blair latched gratefully on to the opportunity presented by 9/11 to turn himself into a player on the international stage. It wasn\u2019t just that he wanted to put the world to rights according to his own lights. It was also that he was able to do so, more easily than he could put his own government right, because the instrument to hand was military force. The same was true of Bush. But it has equally been true of politicians as otherwise different from each other as Margaret Thatcher and Bill Clinton, Barack Obama and Donald Trump. The power of the office they hold is least constrained when it comes to taking action abroad. That is why presidents and PMs, who almost never get elected on a foreign policy platform, often find that foreign policy is what ends up defining their tenure at the top. The international arena is where they can make the biggest difference, for better or for worse. The trauma of 9/11 \u2013 and what followed \u2013 reveals another fundamental truth. The power of presidents and prime ministers is hugely dependent on the accidents of history. For Margaret Thatcher, the Falklands war completely altered what it was possible for her to achieve in office. Without Argentina\u2019s invasion of April 1982, over which she had no control, her premiership would have been very different. For Gordon Brown, the financial crisis of 2007\u20138 reconfigured what he could accomplish, as it did for Obama\u2019s presidency. Such unforeseen events do not suddenly endow presidents and prime ministers with superpowers: the frustrations of trying to get things done remain just as intense (as both Brown and Obama discovered). But they do provide an opportunity to break out of a rut. It helps to arrive in office knowing who you are. Obama, always poised and self-contained, knew his own worth full well. Yet he accomplished less as a result, because he never really pushed the limits of what he could achieve. Thatcher, despite her reputation for knowing her own mind, was surprisingly fragile in her confidence and scatty in her convictions. Yet she understood, with an almost uncanny instinct, what someone with her personality could achieve as prime minister, especially when the occasion arose. Blair was far more self-confident and sure of what he believed than Thatcher was. But it did him little good. He persisted in trying to make the office of PM suit his convictions, rather than trying to adapt those convictions to the limits of what the office made possible. Bill Clinton was perhaps the most intelligent man ever to occupy the Oval Office. His mind was voracious in its appetite for new information and fresh insights. It was too much. He couldn\u2019t contain the intelligence he had within the space of the role he occupied. It spilled out, and too often it went nowhere. It is sometimes said that it doesn\u2019t do for a president or prime minister to be too smart: a second-class mind is more likely to make for a first-class leader. Like many such generalisations about politics, there\u2019s some truth to it, but also plenty that it misses. There are lots of different ways for a politician to be intelligent, and there are many things that politicians can know which are unknown to anyone on the outside. What matters is whether they know what it is that they know. And if they do, whether they understand what that knowledge is good for. \u00b6 This brings us to Trump, who in many ways exemplifies the idea that the personality of the politician reveals the character of the office he occupies. His persona is not going to change. He is disturbingly consistent in what he has always been: showman, chauvinist, charlatan. What he is doing is testing how far a man like that is able to push the boundaries of what a president can be. He has been more successful than many people believed was possible. His willingness to say anything \u2013 and possibly to believe anything \u2013 in order to get his way turns out to be a surprisingly effective means of maximising his authority. Given that a majority of Americans revile him, he has done quite a lot with the limited power he has. Perhaps he too bucks the fable of The Wizard of Oz. He simply refuses to acknowledge the existence of the curtain. He wants people to see! What makes Trump so unnerving, however, is his seeming lack of any self-knowledge. He is not really probing for the limits of what the presidency allows, because that would require him to accept that there are limits. He does what he does regardless. Trump is both more and less than a president should be. More, because he is behaving as though his power were truly as he believes it to be. Less, because he is also behaving as though the presidency were just another job (businessman, reality TV host). Much of the time he does not seem to appreciate where he is. Why would someone whose personality is so fixed be so unpredictable in office? Because that personality makes him incapable of seeing the presidency as its previous occupants have seen it, as an office that comes with certain expectations of how to behave. Trump is, in institutional terms, unhinged. Does that mean he is mentally unfit to be president? During his time in the White House Trump has been dogged by repeated rumours about his intellectual incapacity \u2013 he has been variously described as a \u201cfucking moron\u201d, \u201clike an 11-year-old child\u201d, a \u201cdope\u201d, an \u201cidiot\u201d and \u201cdumb as shit\u201d. And that\u2019s just how his former aides and colleagues speak about him. Plenty of psychiatrists have pushed back hard against the so-called \u201cGoldwater rule\u201d, which prevents them from diagnosing the psychological failings of public figures at second hand. For many, this injunction bars them from simply stating the obvious: Trump is out of his mind. But we should be wary of assuming that this is enough to place Trump beyond the pale of conventional political leadership. Blair was widely thought to have lost his mental bearings during and after the Iraq war. Brown was pursued by stories of titanic rages and prolonged depressions. I have spoken to people who believe that the true story of Theresa May\u2019s premiership has been suppressed, that as a type-1 diabetic she faces cognitive handicaps, including an inability either to process new information or to change her mind. These kinds of accusations come with the territory: presidents and prime ministers are often thought to be psychologically undone by office. It is one of the ways we express our discomfort with anyone aspiring to that kind of power. Max Weber, writing 100 years ago, made the case that the risk of madness is not simply an accidental byproduct of high office. It is an essential part of it: a feature, not a bug. Presidents and prime ministers have to deal with the mental strain of bearing enormous political responsibility without necessarily having the personal authority to match. The leaders of modern states hold the lives of millions in their hands, and yet they often can\u2019t even get the people in the next room to do what they want. It might make anyone a little crazy. Leadership is a constant tug of war between the rules of political accountability and the law of unintended consequences. That has not changed in the time since Weber wrote. One reason it is so hard to be a president or a prime minister is that the voters hold the wizard responsible for what happens. Even though the wizard is just the impostor behind the curtain. By far the sanest president or prime minister of recent times was Obama. He went out of his way to maintain an even keel, even in the face of the most outrageous provocation. He made sure that he stayed connected with his family and that he got enough downtime. Is it possible to be too sane for the presidency? Certainly there were moments when Obama\u2019s insistence on keeping his cool looked like a missed opportunity. Sometimes one longed to see him let rip. But that was not his style. Nor was it what got him elected. This is the other deep tension that resides in the character of anyone who pursues the highest office. The personality traits that can win you the crucial election may not be the ones that suit the role to which you have been elected. Campaigning, as the slogan goes, is not governing. Obama the candidate was known to his inner circle as \u201c\u2018No drama\u2019 Obama\u201d. During his long, bruising, underdog campaign in 2008 to wrest the Democratic nomination from Hillary Clinton, and then for the duration of the shorter but equally high-wire act needed to win a general election that was taking place as the world economy was having a heart attack, his level temperament was a golden asset. Refusing to get ruffled got him over the line. But when he became president he needed other skills too. His preference for cool analysis over impulsive decision-making and his insistence that he would not be baited by his baying opponents \u2013 as his wife, Michelle, memorably said in 2016, \u201cwhen they go low, we go high\u201d \u2013 were still assets. But they were not enough. Personal development is very difficult over the course of a political career, especially when being who you are has made you what you have become. Why would political leaders whose approach to politics won them office abandon that approach once they get there? Trump stormed to the Republican nomination and ultimately the presidency in 2016 with a scorched earth campaign that recognised no limits and took no prisoners. He defeated his rivals by mocking them, belittling them and, when the opportunity arose, lying about them. That is how he has carried on conducting himself as president, to continuing howls of outrage from his opponents. But who is to say he is wrong? If high office doesn\u2019t change who politicians really are, we shouldn\u2019t expect them to change how it makes them behave. Some politicians reach the top without having to win an election to get there. When May faced a general election in 2017, by choice rather than by necessity, the skill set that had got her to Downing Street let her down. The tenacious, colourless, undeviating politician who tiptoed over the corpses to inherit the crown in the aftermath of the Brexit vote morphed on the campaign trail into the deathless Maybot: cold, mechanical and seemingly without a personality of her own. On the stump, Jeremy Corbyn, a politician for whom campaigning has been the lifeblood of his entire career, ran rings round her. Change is hard for politicians. But what makes political leadership so precarious is that it is relatively easy for voters. If we get tired of our politicians, we can get rid of them. The qualities that we once appreciated in a leader can turn surprisingly quickly into what we loathe about them. Blair\u2019s sincerity came to seem like sanctimony. Obama\u2019s coolness turned into aloofness. May\u2019s steadfastness made her come across like a robot. Sooner or later Corbyn\u2019s simplicity will come to appear like idiocy. Another truism of democratic life is that all political careers end in failure. Perhaps it would be easier to say that no political personality is built to last at the very top. The demands of the highest office are never set. Yet if there is one quality that is indispensable for anyone at or near the summit of political life, it is stamina. This does not have to be physical stamina, though that helps. Corbyn has a reputation for being a lazy politician. He rarely strays outside his comfort zone. But there has been nothing lazy about his political career. As a backbench MP he stuck it out for decades, even when he had very little to show for it. Corbyn hung in there, where others might have given up. As a result, he was still around when his chance came. The British and US political systems are different, so the kinds of chances they throw up for resilient politicians will be different too. The presidency is open to genuine outsiders in a way that the prime ministership is not. No one could reach No 10, as Trump reached the White House, without ever having stood for election before in any capacity. A presidential campaign, running over two or more years, with its relentless requirements for fundraising and attention-seeking, makes distinctive demands. It suits personalities as different as Obama\u2019s and Trump\u2019s \u2013 the one unflappable, the other unembarrassable. It would not suit May. British politics is more self-contained, its campaigns shorter and the role of its parliament in selecting political leaders much more pronounced. Corbyn, in turning Labour into a mass movement that downplays the role of its elected MPs, is as close to an outsider as British politics has ever had near its summit. Yet he has had no career outside parliament. Trump\u2019s stamina remains an underrated weapon in his political arsenal. He didn\u2019t just outfight his opponents in 2016, he outlasted them, withstanding setbacks that would have felled a less resilient candidate. His appetite for gruelling speaking engagements has not diminished since he won the presidency. In fact, he seems happiest when he is hammering away at the podium. He has chewed up and spat out a remarkable number of staffers in his relatively short political career. He seems to measure his political success in large part by the number of bodies he can pile up at his door, regardless of their prior allegiances. By that measure, he may be the most successful president in modern American history. What makes him different, though, is his willingness to turn his personal frustrations into the primary vehicle of his political programme. He is the Complainer-in-Chief. Winning the presidency did nothing to temper his feelings of grievance. If anything, it amplified them. All presidents and prime ministers have periods when they feel that they are victims, despite being the most powerful person in the land. Thatcher, Blair, Clinton, Brown, Obama and May certainly have had times of feeling sorry for themselves like that. But none of them made victimhood their raison d\u2019\u00eatre. They knew that such a move would be fatal to their political authority \u2013 the whining, preening egomaniac is not someone who can command the respect of the voters. And without respect the president or prime minister is surely lost. Yet Trump has shown, for now, that they were wrong. Ours is an age of populism. It is now the voters who are testing the limits of the power of presidents and prime ministers as much as it is the politicians themselves. Brexit and Trump have acted as a litmus test that reveals things that were previously hidden about the countries that produced them. We turn out to be divided in new ways \u2013 between old and young, educated and less educated, connected and disconnected \u2013 and often to be as angry with each other as we are with the people who govern us. The idea that it is the character of our political leaders that determines the character of our democracy now appears somewhat quaint. More, perhaps, than in the past, we get the politicians we deserve. Trump makes leadership more important than ever, and also increasingly irrelevant. The paradox of populist leaders is that they promise to empower the people but end up accumulating more and more power in their own hands. They undermine the authority of the democratic offices they hold at the same time as exaggerating it. They are not probing the limits of their own power: they are testing the limits of democracy itself. So where does Boris Johnson fit into this story of high ambition and mismatched expectations? Johnson can have few illusions about the limits of the power of the office he now holds, given that his predecessor\u2019s tenure was a case study in exposing them. May arrived in Downing Street promising both to deliver Brexit and to remedy some of the social injustices that stoked the divisions which lay behind it. She failed to do either. Instead, she spent three years searching in vain for the tools that would get others to comply with her wishes. She couldn\u2019t find them, no matter how doggedly she looked. Calling a general election to supply the missing leverage over her colleagues in parliament only made the situation worse. Yet here is Johnson, making exactly the same promises and threatening exactly the same remedy: do as I say or the voters will tell you! It\u2019s as though the last three years never happened. What does he know that she didn\u2019t? What does he have that she lacked? It can\u2019t be true belief, which Brexiters sometimes say was the crucial ingredient missing from May\u2019s prime ministerial portfolio. Yes, she campaigned for remain whereas Johnson led for leave. But he is also the man who wrote two columns, one for each side of the question, each serviceable depending on which way he decided to jump. He is not a conviction politician. He is a jobbing journalist, for whom convictions are simply the touchpaper to ignite this week\u2019s copy. Nor can it be greater political experience or political skills. What Johnson does have is a certain bearish presence: he enjoys the rough and tumble of politics and has no problem with physical intimacy. If he wants you to do something, he\u2019ll grab you by the arm or pull you by the ear. He is a charmer, a wheedler, a flatterer and an occasional bully. Johnson appears to see these qualities as a substitute for hard work and a grasp of detail but he is not going to get his (or any other) version of Brexit through parliament by grappling his colleagues over the line. Perhaps the new prime minister thinks that he has finally assembled in Downing Street what Blair sought but never quite achieved: a delivery unit that can actually deliver. It\u2019s a one-man unit named Dominic Cummings, the man who delivered victory for Vote Leave in the referendum. However, winning the referendum is very different from delivering Brexit itself. Cummings may yet find a way to engineer another victory at the ballot box. But the bureaucratic grind of forging a lasting settlement looks beyond him. Johnson\u2019s delivery unit is in the business of getting him through the next few months. What happens after that is anyone\u2019s guess. Johnson is behaving as though Brexit were just another foreign policy challenge, giving him the same licence his predecessors have sometimes enjoyed when taking on foreigners. This is international politics, so he doesn\u2019t see why he has to stand on ceremony. He can throw his weight around, unencumbered by democratic niceties. The May government, according to this version of events, was far too worried about creating the right impression. But Brexit is not just another foreign policy challenge. It is a legal, economic and diplomatic nightmare. No amount of sub-Churchillian rhetoric can change the fact that a successful exit strategy is almost entirely dependent on the goodwill of others, ranging from Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel to the Irish government and the European Commission, not to mention the foreign currency and bond markets. Treating it like a war doesn\u2019t make it one. It just makes it more likely that the limits of the power of the prime minister will once again be exposed. In the end, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the only game-changing asset Johnson has that his predecessor may have lacked is a willingness to embrace his inner Trump. What Johnson brings to the table is an appetite for creative destruction: not testing the limits of the office he holds but hoping to ignore them altogether. He is relying on energy, animal spirits and a disregard not just for the conventional wisdom but for the rules of the game to carry him through. If he succeeds, it will be a clear indication that the rules are indeed changing. The story of modern politics \u2013 of presidents and prime ministers frustrated by and chafing against the limits of their power \u2013 will have a new chapter. In many ways, Johnson is not Trump. He is more of a hybrid politician, whose character contains bits of the past that cling to him like debris from another age. He tries to ape Thatcherite resolve, Blairish charisma, Clintonian chutzpah about his personal indiscretions. But being Thatcher or Blair or Clinton won\u2019t get Johnson out of the Brexit mess that he helped to create and which he has now inherited. If he finds a way through it will be because his obvious weaknesses and his disregard for the truth turned out not to matter. Like Trump, he will have pulled back the curtain and got away with it. Can this approach succeed? I do not know what comes next, any more than Johnson does. But if the result of the turmoil of the past few years and of the months and years to come is that we end up with less faith in the power of presidents and prime ministers to make all the difference, that will be no bad thing. Maybe what comes after the myth of the strong leader is the idea of leaderless democracy. There are far worse ideas. When Thatcher, the closest Britain has had to a strong leader in modern times, died in 2013, many of her diehard critics celebrated on Twitter by announcing: \u201cDing, Dong! The Witch is dead!\u201d But it\u2019s not the return of the Wicked Witch we should fear. It\u2019s the revenge of the frustrated Wizard. \u2022 David Runciman\u2019s Where Power Stops: The Making and Unmaking of Presidents and Prime Ministers is published this month by Profile.",

      "bodyText": "My first novel was published in 1987. It was the first British crime novel with a lesbian detective. The only route to publication was via an independent feminist publisher. Back then, there were a few radical bookshops that stocked titles like mine. But getting mainstream shops to stock it was an uphill struggle. Finding representations of queer lives took dedication and stubborn persistence. Gradually, that has changed. Now our words are part of the mainstream of British literary life. LGBTQ writers are not only published by mainstream publishers and stocked by libraries, bookshops and supermarkets; they win major prizes. For so long conspicuous by our absence, we are now conspicuous by our presence. I wrote a lesbian heroine because I\u2019d grown up in a time and place where there were no templates for the life I wanted to live. The queer struggle for self-definition has been pursued in no small part so that the next generation has a springboard for imagining how to live. Every literary movement requires pioneers to kick open the door a crack. Others spot the opening and push the door wider. Then, at last, there\u2019s room for everyone to walk through and write the lives they want to write. So I was delighted to be asked by the National Centre for Writing and the British Council to choose 10 writers to showcase the quality and breadth of LGBTQ writing in Britain today. The authors are Colette Bryce, Juno Dawson, Rosie Garland, Keith Jarrett, Juliet Jacques, Kirsty Logan, Andrew McMillan, Fiona Mozley, Mary Paulson-Ellis and Luke Turner. From novels to memoirs, short stories to film scripts, poetry to plays, their work covers a broad spectrum of form, style and content. There is, genuinely, something here for everyone. Because these writers are writing for everyone. These are not words for a niche readership. These are not writings for a ghetto. These are the works of writers who have something to say that can be \u2013 and should be \u2013 heard by as many people as possible. Although their words will have particular resonance for some readers over others, isn\u2019t that what good writing always does? LGBTQ writers have forced their way out of the dark corners where we were pushed by a society that didn\u2019t want to be reminded of our existence. Thanks to writers such as Ali Smith, Alan Hollinghurst, Russell T Davies, Carol Ann Duffy and many more, LGBTQ writers are everywhere. And deservedly praised everywhere, too. Recommended by reviewers, librarians, teachers, booksellers, reviewers and friends. Some might say the battle is won, the war is over. But a quick scan of news headlines and social media on any given day gives the lie to that. LGBTQ people are still bullied at school and in the workplace. We are still the targets of hate crime.

In clearing, I\u2019d say don\u2019t be afraid to ask questions and be persistent \u2013 don\u2019t wait for people to message you back; you have to get on to the phone and chase. You need to weigh up the pros and cons and work out what\u2019s right \u2013 not just stay on a course because you\u2019re there. HP",

The first is to splutter at the photos of billowing incense, and the dog\u2019s corpse laid respectfully on white linen strewn with rose petals, before quacking something about bloody self-indulgent Hollywood celebs who value a pet\u2019s life more highly than a human\u2019s.</p> <p>The second is to be momentarily wobbly-lipped, recalling small friends now departed of one\u2019s own.

Your average cat will move in two doors down overnight without a backwards glance if you downgrade their Iams duck in jelly pouches to tins of Lidl Coshida, or buy a new Hoover, the sound of which they don\u2019t care for.

We should talk about our options.\u201d</p> <p>Clark had moved into our home uninvited; a ginger tom with pink lips who announced his entry into rooms with an entitled squirrel-like chirrup. He liked prawns, the occasional Dorito and kneading visitors\u2019 bellies with his soil-covered paws while drooling. He loathed bluebottles, rocking chairs and the washing machine on spin. \u201cWhat would you like done with Clark\u2019s body?\u201d I was asked, by the vet, some years later, as Clark lay on the surgery table, eyes open, yet no longer breathing, lifted mercifully away from his misery.</p> <p>\u201cUm, cremation,\u201d I mumbled, ticking a box on a list. The memory is blurry, but I recall taking one last look at him lying, face down, alone. I told no one how upset I was. Nor did I pick up the ashes for two years, which still sit in a box in my house, and, let\u2019s be honest, are probably the back foot of a carthorse mixed with two other people\u2019s hamsters. It was ridiculous. Yes, mourning a dog or a cat more than a man down the street you only half knew may sound macabre to some. But when Aniston and Theroux responded to Dolly\u2019s death with an evening of spiritual blessing and high melodrama, I saw this as entirely relatable.</p> <p>During the summer months, one of my cats, Geno \u2013 after the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-hwfA_LMIU\" title=\"\">Dexy</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-hwfA_LMIU\" title=\"\">s song</a>, since you ask \u2013 is resolute that 4am is the prime time to get the house up and moving. It begins with a claw in my nostril, at about the time the birds start chirping. Then he takes a seat on my pillow, his anus just short of my forehead, to begin vigorous fur-washing. When swatted away, he moves under the bed to commence what cat-lovers on the internet term \u201csinging the song of his people\u201d. Just like the Terminator, Geno can\u2019t be bargained with. He doesn\u2019t feel pity, or remorse. He will not stop until you are awake. This is not behaviour one would tolerate from anything other than a loved one. Or a dictator. When he goes, I plan to mourn him like Aniston and Theroux mourned Dolly. Clear the diary, light the incense \u2013 this time, people will know.</p>",

Nor did I pick up the ashes for two years, which still sit in a box in my house, and, let\u2019s be honest, are probably the back foot of a carthorse mixed with two other people\u2019s hamsters. It was ridiculous. Yes, mourning a dog or a cat more than a man down the street you only half knew may sound macabre to some. But when Aniston and Theroux responded to Dolly\u2019s death with an evening of spiritual blessing and high melodrama, I saw this as entirely relatable. During the summer months, one of my cats, Geno \u2013 after the Dexys song, since you ask \u2013 is resolute that 4am is the prime time to get the house up and moving. It begins with a claw in my nostril, at about the time the birds start chirping. Then he takes a seat on my pillow, his anus just short of my forehead, to begin vigorous fur-washing. When swatted away, he moves under the bed to commence what cat-lovers on the internet term \u201csinging the song of his people\u201d. Just like the Terminator, Geno can\u2019t be bargained with. He doesn\u2019t feel pity, or remorse. He will not stop until you are awake. This is not behaviour one would tolerate from anything other than a loved one. Or a dictator. When he goes, I plan to mourn him like Aniston and Theroux mourned Dolly. Clear the diary, light the incense \u2013 this time, people will know.",

      "body": "<p>A comedian friend of mine told me that being on stage is the only place he feels completely in control. How incredibly lucky, I thought: I feel the opposite. Sure, I wrote the words I\u2019m saying, and I\u2019m in charge of my body, but aside from that it\u2019s up to the gods. This feeling is part insecurity and partly because of a gross experience I had at last year\u2019s Edinburgh fringe which, if it was a god\u2019s fault, was definitely Zeus\u2019s.</p> <p>An audience member had a wank in my show. I know, such a Zeus thing to do. I don\u2019t want to scare anyone who is attending but, in the dark, humid caves that make up a large number of the festival\u2019s venues, people can apparently get away with stuff like that. I was made aware of it afterwards by venue staff. They were informed by another comic who had seen it happening but, knowing what it means to perform at the festival, did not want to interrupt my show. So he sat through it all, occasionally nudging the man to try and get him to stop. Hearing about it afterwards, it affected both me and my show, as I was definitely more worried about doing all my dick jokes. It made me feel violated, and I worried that he\u2019d come back.</p> <p>When I began doing comedy, the stage was a place where I could finally be myself. Whatever weird stuff was inside my head could come out and, instead of being judged for it, I could use it to make people laugh (sometimes). Amazing! Of course, to most people, I don\u2019t look like your average comedian. In fact, due to the increasingly broad array of voices, audiences have a growing need for a quick definition. \u2018What the hell are we looking at? And make it snappy!\u2019 I usually get boiled down to this: I\u2019m female and foreign.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d2a783f3cfa6dff38e847e7912c828d1fb95a82c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2a783f3cfa6dff38e847e7912c828d1fb95a82c/0_989_5504_3302/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Overman \u2026 \u2018Being in love is the same as being tired\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Overman \u2026 \u2018Being in love is the same as being tired\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: -</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They\u2019re not wrong: I am a Dutch girl. But to me this is just a boring formality, the stuff to get out of the way before I can get to what I really want to do, which is be a silly idiot and tell dick jokes. Being in control on stage helps to convey a clear sense of self, and that\u2019s never been my strong suit. In school I only managed to be \u201ckind of weird\u201d and never quite fit in, even with the proper outsiders. You know, the ones who loved Morrissey, French cinema and cigarettes \u2013 they\u2019re the same everywhere.</p> <p>Identity is shaped as much by what you think you are as by what other people project on to you. In my show this year, I talk about a couple of different guys who I thought were my friends but turned out only to be interested in sex, and would be surprised and sometimes angry when I didn\u2019t return their interest. What about all the effort they put in? Surely, like in the movies, if they just kept trying I would fall for their charms \u2013 because we all know that being in love is the same as being tired.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>'It affected both me and my show, as I was definitely more worried about doing all my dick jokes'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Those guys saw me as a love interest and I worried this was my fault somehow. So I ended up adjusting my behaviour with other friends. How other people see and define you affects you. In the same way, kids who are bullied often gain victim complexes, become attention seekers or, worse, turn needlessly defiant.</p> <p>Since the incident last summer, I\u2019ve heard of two other performers who\u2019ve had the same happen to them. I\u2019m sure there are more. It\u2019s so ridiculous that this is something we have to worry about. It\u2019s hard enough going to the fringe hoping people will take an interest in you as a comic, without having some literal wanker treat you like a sexual object. It really hasn\u2019t helped me with my sense of self, and it certainly hasn\u2019t helped me find my way back to thinking about comedy as a space where I can safely express myself.</p> <p>But I\u2019m also done worrying about it. I love standup and he\u2019s not allowed to take that from me. I\u2019ve decided to accept the fact that some things will always be out of my control, and as a way of putting it to bed this year, I\u2019m bluntly addressing it in my show. That way, if Mr Wankypants does come back, he might feel as much shame as I did.</p> <ul> <li><p>Micky Overman is at the <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/micky-overman-presents-presenting-miss-micky-overman\">Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh</a>, until 25 August.</p></li> </ul>",

So he sat through it all, occasionally nudging the man to try and get him to stop. Hearing about it afterwards, it affected both me and my show, as I was definitely more worried about doing all my dick jokes. It made me feel violated, and I worried that he\u2019d come back. When I began doing comedy, the stage was a place where I could finally be myself. Whatever weird stuff was inside my head could come out and, instead of being judged for it, I could use it to make people laugh (sometimes). Amazing! Of course, to most people, I don\u2019t look like your average comedian. In fact, due to the increasingly broad array of voices, audiences have a growing need for a quick definition. \u2018What the hell are we looking at? And make it snappy!\u2019 I usually get boiled down to this: I\u2019m female and foreign. They\u2019re not wrong: I am a Dutch girl. But to me this is just a boring formality, the stuff to get out of the way before I can get to what I really want to do, which is be a silly idiot and tell dick jokes. Being in control on stage helps to convey a clear sense of self, and that\u2019s never been my strong suit. In school I only managed to be \u201ckind of weird\u201d and never quite fit in, even with the proper outsiders. You know, the ones who loved Morrissey, French cinema and cigarettes \u2013 they\u2019re the same everywhere. Identity is shaped as much by what you think you are as by what other people project on to you. In my show this year, I talk about a couple of different guys who I thought were my friends but turned out only to be interested in sex, and would be surprised and sometimes angry when I didn\u2019t return their interest. What about all the effort they put in? Surely, like in the movies, if they just kept trying I would fall for their charms \u2013 because we all know that being in love is the same as being tired. Those guys saw me as a love interest and I worried this was my fault somehow. So I ended up adjusting my behaviour with other friends. How other people see and define you affects you. In the same way, kids who are bullied often gain victim complexes, become attention seekers or, worse, turn needlessly defiant. Since the incident last summer, I\u2019ve heard of two other performers who\u2019ve had the same happen to them. I\u2019m sure there are more. It\u2019s so ridiculous that this is something we have to worry about. It\u2019s hard enough going to the fringe hoping people will take an interest in you as a comic, without having some literal wanker treat you like a sexual object. It really hasn\u2019t helped me with my sense of self, and it certainly hasn\u2019t helped me find my way back to thinking about comedy as a space where I can safely express myself. But I\u2019m also done worrying about it. I love standup and he\u2019s not allowed to take that from me. I\u2019ve decided to accept the fact that some things will always be out of my control, and as a way of putting it to bed this year, I\u2019m bluntly addressing it in my show. That way, if Mr Wankypants does come back, he might feel as much shame as I did. Micky Overman is at the Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 25 August.",

      "body": "<p>Even as someone whose job it is to cover the streaming scene, I admit I\u2019m often stumbling through it as blindly as everyone else. Away from the well-publicised brands like Netflix or Amazon, there are many outlets I find more by accident than design. Such is the case with the rather unprepossessingly named <a href=\"https://www.pantaflix.com/\" title=\"\">Pantaflix</a>, a site that had been in my peripheral internet vision for some time through hazy, lazy searches for viewing alternatives, without ever quite inviting me to click on it. A German-based pay-per-view film site founded by the actor Matthias Schweigh\u00f6fer, it\u2019s been available in the UK for nearly three years now, yet neither its content nor its brand ever quite drew me in.</p> <p>That changed a couple of weeks ago: for an unrelated project I was seeking out the early documentary shorts of late Polish master Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski, and finding them rather hard to track down online \u2013 only to <a href=\"https://www.pantaflix.com/en/c/krzysztof-kieslowski-documentary-films\" title=\"\">find them streaming</a>, seemingly exclusively, at Pantaflix, where they\u2019re splashily billed as a top attraction on the <a href=\"https://www.pantaflix.com/en/explore\" title=\"\">homepage</a>.</p> <p>Made across the 1970s, the 16 Kie\u015blowski films range from his searching vox-pop exercise <strong><a href=\"https://www.pantaflix.com/en/m/741710\" title=\"\">Talking Heads</a></strong> to the blunt procedural verite of <strong><a href=\"https://www.pantaflix.com/en/m/741719\" title=\"\">Hospital</a></strong> to the candid unemployment confessional<strong> <a href=\"https://www.pantaflix.com/en/m/741721\" title=\"\">I Don\u2019t Know</a></strong>. Bearing the poised humanity and grace of Kie\u015blowski\u2019s later fiction work, despite their monochrome roughness, they proved worth the search \u2013 though at \u00a32.99 a pop there ought to be a cheaper way to watch them. (Some have been stuck, rather randomly, as extras on Blu-ray rereleases of the director\u2019s more famous works.) A box set is surely called for.</p> <p>As Pantaflix bait, however, they did the job: I was curious to see what other treasures were buried on the kind of website that spotlights 40-year-old Kie\u015blowski docs as prominently as Netflix does the new series of <em><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80160037\" title=\"\">Queer Eye</a></em>. As it turns out, the site is a bit of a rummage sale of lesser-spotted art cinema, documentaries, a scattering of reassuring Hollywood classics and a lot of mainstream international films rarely screened outside their home country. That, indeed, is something of a selling point. \u201cHome is just a movie away,\u201d runs their tagline, as the site seems designed less for armchair-travelling cinephiles than for immigrants across Europe seeking home-comfort viewing without regional restrictions. Click on the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.pantaflix.com/en/search?languages[0]=tur&amp;assetTypes[0]=movie\" title=\"\">Turkish Movies</a>\u201d tag, for example, and you won\u2019t find a lot of Nuri Bilge Ceylan; many films aren\u2019t furnished with English subtitles.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f623b5e5d60ec3e6d210b5d317b53c996fdb34eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f623b5e5d60ec3e6d210b5d317b53c996fdb34eb/0_46_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Guillaume Canet and Marion Cotillard in Rock\u2019n Roll.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Director Guillaume Canet and Marion Cotillard star as themselves in the \u2018highly meta\u2019 Rock\u2019n Roll.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Path\u00e9/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet the gems are there for patient, open-minded diggers, from Ruben \u00d6stlund\u2019s striking bad-behaviour mosaic <strong><a href=\"https://www.pantaflix.com/en/m/742972\" title=\"\">Involuntary</a> </strong>to the famously outrageous Belgian serial-killer mockumentary <strong><a href=\"https://www.pantaflix.com/en/m/748120\" title=\"\">Man Bites Dog</a></strong>. In their French section, I was delighted to find L\u00e9a Mysius\u2019s moody, ingeniously visualised <strong><a href=\"https://www.pantaflix.com/en/m/748118\" title=\"\">Ava</a></strong>, a sidebar standout from the 2017 Cannes festival that more or less evaporated beyond the festival circuit. A sensual study of a 13-year-old girl rapidly losing her sight, it skirts coming-of-age cliche to reflect on ephemeral youth with urgency and risk. Guillaume Canet\u2019s<strong> <a href=\"https://www.pantaflix.com/en/m/748131\" title=\"\">Rock\u2019n Roll</a></strong>, meanwhile, is a clever, highly meta exercise, starring the director and Marion Cotillard as themselves in a larkish industry satire so garlicky and Gallic it could never really travel \u2013 and yet here it is.</p> <p>Kieslowski aside, a generously stocked documentary section is full of surprises amid the sometimes intriguing obscurities. Steve James\u2019s still-mighty, still-timely sports doc <strong><a href=\"https://www.pantaflix.com/en/m/740755\" title=\"\">Hoop Dreams</a></strong> is there, as is Austrian provocateur Ulrich Seidl\u2019s challenging, enraging, altogether extraordinary <strong><a href=\"https://www.pantaflix.com/en/m/756426\" title=\"\">Safari</a></strong>, an icy, tacitly damning study of hunting tourism that can\u2019t come loaded with enough trigger warnings.

      "bodyText": "Even as someone whose job it is to cover the streaming scene, I admit I\u2019m often stumbling through it as blindly as everyone else. Away from the well-publicised brands like Netflix or Amazon, there are many outlets I find more by accident than design. Such is the case with the rather unprepossessingly named Pantaflix, a site that had been in my peripheral internet vision for some time through hazy, lazy searches for viewing alternatives, without ever quite inviting me to click on it. A German-based pay-per-view film site founded by the actor Matthias Schweigh\u00f6fer, it\u2019s been available in the UK for nearly three years now, yet neither its content nor its brand ever quite drew me in. That changed a couple of weeks ago: for an unrelated project I was seeking out the early documentary shorts of late Polish master Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski, and finding them rather hard to track down online \u2013 only to find them streaming, seemingly exclusively, at Pantaflix, where they\u2019re splashily billed as a top attraction on the homepage. Made across the 1970s, the 16 Kie\u015blowski films range from his searching vox-pop exercise Talking Heads to the blunt procedural verite of Hospital to the candid unemployment confessional I Don\u2019t Know. Bearing the poised humanity and grace of Kie\u015blowski\u2019s later fiction work, despite their monochrome roughness, they proved worth the search \u2013 though at \u00a32.99 a pop there ought to be a cheaper way to watch them. (Some have been stuck, rather randomly, as extras on Blu-ray rereleases of the director\u2019s more famous works.) A box set is surely called for. As Pantaflix bait, however, they did the job: I was curious to see what other treasures were buried on the kind of website that spotlights 40-year-old Kie\u015blowski docs as prominently as Netflix does the new series of Queer Eye. As it turns out, the site is a bit of a rummage sale of lesser-spotted art cinema, documentaries, a scattering of reassuring Hollywood classics and a lot of mainstream international films rarely screened outside their home country. That, indeed, is something of a selling point. \u201cHome is just a movie away,\u201d runs their tagline, as the site seems designed less for armchair-travelling cinephiles than for immigrants across Europe seeking home-comfort viewing without regional restrictions. Click on the \u201cTurkish Movies\u201d tag, for example, and you won\u2019t find a lot of Nuri Bilge Ceylan; many films aren\u2019t furnished with English subtitles. Yet the gems are there for patient, open-minded diggers, from Ruben \u00d6stlund\u2019s striking bad-behaviour mosaic Involuntary to the famously outrageous Belgian serial-killer mockumentary Man Bites Dog. In their French section, I was delighted to find L\u00e9a Mysius\u2019s moody, ingeniously visualised Ava, a sidebar standout from the 2017 Cannes festival that more or less evaporated beyond the festival circuit. A sensual study of a 13-year-old girl rapidly losing her sight, it skirts coming-of-age cliche to reflect on ephemeral youth with urgency and risk. Guillaume Canet\u2019s Rock\u2019n Roll, meanwhile, is a clever, highly meta exercise, starring the director and Marion Cotillard as themselves in a larkish industry satire so garlicky and Gallic it could never really travel \u2013 and yet here it is. Kieslowski aside, a generously stocked documentary section is full of surprises amid the sometimes intriguing obscurities. Steve James\u2019s still-mighty, still-timely sports doc Hoop Dreams is there, as is Austrian provocateur Ulrich Seidl\u2019s challenging, enraging, altogether extraordinary Safari, an icy, tacitly damning study of hunting tourism that can\u2019t come loaded with enough trigger warnings. The small, dingily selected LGBT section is a disappointment, but the golden-oldies department is delight-strewn. Fritz Lang\u2019s slinky noir Scarlet Street rubs shoulders with Jean Renoir\u2019s rich, earthy Texan sharecropping portrait The Southerner. You\u2019ll have noticed precious little of a throughline between these highlights, but the haphazard pick-and-mix nature of Pantaflix \u2013 which could, nonetheless, stand to improve its vague indexing and dicey search function \u2013 is seemingly the point. I\u2019ll be grazing more often.

This event is the catalyst for Until the Flood, which digs into the aftermath of the shooting and unearths ugly truths about race in the United States.</p> <p>Over the last few decades, American theatre has developed a tradition of processing trauma through documentary.

With a single item of clothing and a subtle shifting of her limbs, Orlandersmith transforms into her characters one by one. There\u2019s the young black man who jitters with fear, praying that he escapes Brown\u2019s fate; the racist who leans into the audience as he spits out the N-word; the white woman who fiddles nervously with her wine glass as she tries to see both sides.</p> <p>Race comes in and out of focus. Orlandersmith allows her characters to be more than their politics or prejudices, a choice that can make the racism even more horrifying when it rears its head.

      "bodyText": "Dael Orlandersmith\u2019s play both is and isn\u2019t about the 2014 shooting of black teenager Michael Brown by white police officer Darren Wilson. This event is the catalyst for Until the Flood, which digs into the aftermath of the shooting and unearths ugly truths about race in the United States. Over the last few decades, American theatre has developed a tradition of processing trauma through documentary. Until the Flood follows in the footsteps of The Laramie Project and Anna Deveare Smith\u2019s verbatim shows, bearing more than a passing resemblance to the latter. The play is based on interviews with people in St Louis, but \u2013 unlike Smith \u2013 Orlandersmith has turned these real people into fictionalised composites. In front of a candle-filled, flickering memorial to Brown, each speaker is fully inhabited and dispassionately held up for inspection. With a single item of clothing and a subtle shifting of her limbs, Orlandersmith transforms into her characters one by one. There\u2019s the young black man who jitters with fear, praying that he escapes Brown\u2019s fate; the racist who leans into the audience as he spits out the N-word; the white woman who fiddles nervously with her wine glass as she tries to see both sides. Race comes in and out of focus. Orlandersmith allows her characters to be more than their politics or prejudices, a choice that can make the racism even more horrifying when it rears its head. We get a glimpse of these people\u2019s lives, their struggles and dreams, making it harder to dismiss them when they utter something abhorrent. No matter how educated the white speakers, what\u2019s striking is their failure to grasp structural racism, the inability to appreciate their own privilege. The politics of the play itself is understated.

      "body": "<p>The sisters were buried in their favourite clothes: Patricia in a white dress and Mirana in plimsolls, a skirt and a blouse. Patricia was three and loved her Barbie. Not the Barbies that most girls in the village play with \u2013 dolls made from bamboo sticks, with grass \u201chair\u201d tied in elastic bands \u2013 but a real one, with a pink plastic face. Her father, Augustin Randrianasolo, now 62, had bought it a few years earlier from the market for 200 Malagasy ariary (then worth 50p), a lot of money in the early 80s.</p> <p>Mirana died seven years after her sister, in the early 90s; she was two and a half. \u201cNot yet old enough to really speak,\u201d says her older sister, Odile, who is now 35. \u201cShe was the most beautiful of all of us,\u201d she continues. \u201cShe had the nicest hair, the most beautiful face. She looked like my dad.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cef7f91637549c7d4cb239a27736f233ec45d236\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cef7f91637549c7d4cb239a27736f233ec45d236/0_858_3840_4800/800.jpg\" alt=\"Odile, 35, with her son Philbert.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Odile, 35, with her son Philbert.

They married when Augustin was 20 and Isabelle was 16, and settled in Ambatoantrano, a remote village in the central highlands of Madagascar. Augustin was measured, thoughtful and could read and write. She was a talented seamstress and embroiderer.</p> <p>The sisters died in the rainy season. The village is built on a slope and, when it rains, water streams down the pathways. Today, it is mainly red soil that gets swept into puddles. Back then, it was mixed with human faeces. There were hardly any toilets in the village; until three years ago, most people defecated in the maize fields at the edge of the village, or in the tall grass behind the school. The puddles the children splashed and jumped in were sources of life-threatening disease. Cases of diarrhoea always peaked with the rain, from November to April: children suffered most. Patricia\u2019s death happened very quickly \u2013 three days from the onset of a persistent stomach ache and diarrhoea to death. \u201cWe didn\u2019t pay too much attention at first. Diarrhoea is very common,\u201d her father says. \u201cBut then it got worse.\u201d</p> <p>They tried to take Patricia to the health centre in the next village, but heavy rains cut off the road. They gave her an infusion made from ground guava leaves that she could not keep down, and bought some pills from the village shop. \u201cBut when it\u2019s really bad diarrhoea, these pills don\u2019t work,\u201d he says. Patricia died in the night of profound dehydration. Her parents were stunned. \u201cShe had been there, and then, very suddenly, she went,\u201d Augustin says. His face is full of pain.</p> <p>When Mirana got ill, it took a long time for Odile to understand what was happening. \u201cMy mother wanted to take her to the hospital because she saw how dangerous it was, but my dad wanted to go to his father, a healer, in the village. He gave her some medicine, but my mum didn\u2019t want it. She burnt it.\u201d Finally, they got someone to drive them to the hospital in town, but it was too late. The parents blamed each other and separated a month later.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4cb5feabccb12990bc4ffbe61f74132d2c9cd853\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4cb5feabccb12990bc4ffbe61f74132d2c9cd853/0_554_3840_4797/801.jpg\" alt=\"Augustin, 62\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Augustin shares his latrine with a neighbour who has a family of nine and who helped build it.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elena Heatherwick</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cShe was disappointed about life, about us,\u201d Augustin says of his wife. Isabelle left for a man who was improving the road to the village. She took the four girls and moved to a town 500km away.</p> <p>Although he was only 35 when his wife left, Augustin never remarried. \u201cI decided to live my life alone,\u201d he says. For the past 30 years, he has focused on farming and village affairs; he is currently vice-president of the community, after serving as president for five years. \u201cSometimes when I think about my wife and my daughters I go to the shop and buy something to drink,\u201d he says. Usually Malagasy rum.</p> <p>Odile says all the pain in her family can be traced back to one thing. If there had been toilets in the village, everything would have been different. \u201cMy sisters wouldn\u2019t have died and we would have had a better life.\u201d</p> <p>About 673 million people in the world don\u2019t have sanitation, according to the most recent statistics, <a href=\"https://washdata.org/\">published in 2019</a> by the World Health Organisation and Unicef.<br>Not even a stinking, fly-invested box, or a rickety shack that empties over a ditch \u2013 this counts as sanitation, though of an unsafe variety. The people who have access to this \u2013 <a href=\"https://washdata.org/\">701 million people</a> \u2013 are relatively fortunate, compared with those without any latrine, who must defecate in street gutters, behind bushes or into rivers or plastic bags. The impact on health is huge. Diarrhoea caused by faecally contaminated food or water \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24779548\" title=\"\">nearly 58% of </a><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24779548\" title=\"\">cases</a> \u2013 kills 910,300 people a year: many of them are children. According to Unicef, it is the biggest hurdle that a young child in a developing country must overcome to survive \u2013 bigger than HIV, tuberculosis or malaria.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"98bc008ef1c9506fe17ddccbeab223141530e45d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98bc008ef1c9506fe17ddccbeab223141530e45d/24_278_5568_3957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A village latrine.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"711\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A village latrine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elena Heatherwick</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Good sanitation can reduce diarrhoea cases by nearly 35%. It means children are less likely to be off school with tummy ache and girls can attend when they get their periods \u2013 otherwise, what do you do if your school has no toilet? Where good sanitation exists, people are wealthier and healthier.</p> <p>But inserting a good system into a developing country is not easy. \u201cIt is critical not only to have a functioning government but one that prioritises sanitation,\u201d says Andr\u00e9s Hueso, senior policy analyst for WaterAid. Brazil, for example, has <a href=\"https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/2019-04/fs_1904_milex_2018.pdf\" title=\"\">increased its military spending</a> over the past decade, but <a href=\"https://www.lek.com/sites/default/files/insights/pdf-attachments/2018-What-Must-Done-Improve-Brazil-Water-Sewage-Infrastructure.pdf\" title=\"\">reduced its investment</a> in water and sewage systems, despite having a sanitation ranking of <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/amp/agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/en/geral/noticia/2014-03/brazil-112th-place-sanitation-ranking%3famp\" title=\"\">112 out of 200 countries</a> in the most recent survey by the World Bank, in 2014. Treating the resulting diseases cost Brazil nearly $25m (\u00a320m) in 2017 alone.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The latrines were funded and designed by the villagers \u2013 an approach that helps to make people feel more invested</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>To make a lasting change requires more than a high-level political push, Hueso says. \u201cYou need real work at grassroots level, and behavioural change.\u201d Defecating in the open is as old as humankind \u2013 and a practice that is still celebrated in countries such as Madagascar with startling fervour. \u201cMen will say: \u2018I like going in the fresh air. I like the walk in the morning. I like socialising with my friends when I go in the open,\u2019\u201d Hueso says. \u201cBut very rarely will women say they enjoy it.\u201d</p> <p>Going to the toilet outdoors is dangerous and embarrassing for women and girls. In many communities, modesty requires that they get up at 4am to do it under the cover of darkness, leaving them vulnerable to sexual assault and snakes. \u201cIn almost every developing country, you will hear women say: I go at night, so people don\u2019t see me. I always go with a friend, so she can keep an eye on people prying,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"eec8a13038cee8408b00aa09bf7ad74974cbc747\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eec8a13038cee8408b00aa09bf7ad74974cbc747/0_0_3840_4800/800.jpg\" alt=\"A grandmother and her grandchildren in the coffee shop\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A grandmother and her grandchildren in the coffee shop.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elena Heatherwick</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Only one road connects Ambatoantrano to the nearest town of Ts\u2019didy. The drive takes two hours, snaking over mountainous terrain. The village is home to about 2,000 people, none of whom own a car. Only three have a motorbike. Augustin, like most people in the village, gets around on a bicycle; it takes him three hours to cycle to Ts\u2019didy \u2013 longer when the rains turn the road into a quagmire.</p> <p>It is a pre-industrial life. People depend on the land, with dozens heading off to work in the fields as morning breaks, having been woken by cockerels. The women, young and old, are always working \u2013 pulling weeds from the ground, crouching in the red dust to pound rice, hanging washing out to dry on bushes and trees. With no toy shops or TV, children make up their own games. Boys play marbles with rounded pebbles or guava stones; girls plait skipping ropes from the long grass at the edge of the village.</p> <p>There are cattle-drawn carts and guinea pigs are food, not pets. Getting mobile coverage is a laborious process, as the sole hotspot is by a tree in the centre of the village. There are more churches (five) than shops (three) and the congregations gather for Sunday morning services that last for three hours. Raymond Razafiarison, 63, the pastor of the Lutheran church, is one of only a few people in the village to have solar power.</p> <p>And yet Ambatoantrano bucks a trend in Madagascar. In the country as a whole, fewer than 10% of households have a private toilet \u2013 among the <a href=\"https://washmatters.wateraid.org/publications/the-crisis-in-the-classroom-the-state-of-the-worlds-toilets-2018\" title=\"\">lowest rates of sanitation in the world</a>. In rural areas, these numbers are even lower; people are more likely to use a mobile phone than a loo. But here, nearly 98% of households have their own toilet. Despite having no electricity or sewage works, it has higher sanitation levels than Bulgaria, thanks to the efforts of NGOs and charities over the past two years.</p> <p>Aurelie Ranoeliarimanana, 56, was one of the first in the village to get a latrine. She is now the head of a church\u2019s women\u2019s association and is wearing her church finery (black patent shoes with buckles) when we meet one Sunday morning. Her childhood ambition was to be a midwife, although a lack of money held her back. \u201cI had an aunt who was a doctor in a hospital and she allowed me to do a kind of internship. Because I wanted to work in the health sector, I knew that a latrine and a bathroom were really important.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d6537b174634f0660f9b73c92381640731626c19\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6537b174634f0660f9b73c92381640731626c19/48_74_4673_5841/800.jpg\" alt=\"Shella Nomenjanahary and Florette Raharinirina on the beach in Morondava that local fishing families use as their latrine.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shella Nomenjanahary and Florette Raharinirina on the beach in Morondava that local fishing families use as their latrine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elena Heatherwick</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She remembers the early 80s, when many young villagers died after having diarrhoea. \u201cWe kept on burying children, maybe 10 a year at that time,\u201d she says. They included her own nieces, who were aged one and three. In 1997, pastor Razafiarison led the funeral service for his granddaughter, who died when she was barely four weeks old. \u201cShe had diarrhoea, continuous diarrhoea,\u201d he says. Her name was Tafita. \u201cIt means succeed,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Ranoeliarimanana\u2019s first latrine dates from when she was newly married, in 1979. It was similar to the pit or long-drop toilets built in the village today. These have three components \u2013 a deep hole in the ground; a concrete slab or mud floor with a small hole (sometimes laid with two bricks squatting distance apart); and a shelter \u2013 and are built close to the house (but not too close, because of the stench).</p> <p>A pit toilet is ideal for places without water or sewers, because the faeces compost in the deep hole. When it is full, after four years or so, the owner digs another one and starts again.</p> <p>Ranoeliarimanana talks with pride of her many latrines and how, even 10 years ago, they were a rarity. In 2016, only about 5% of families had a latrine. The turning point was the arrival of water in early 2017, from a source seven miles away, thanks to a gravity flow system and \u00a370,000 from WaterAid. This meant women no longer had to make the long walk to collect water from the river. It meant fundraising photographs could be taken of water gushing from the village\u2019s tap stands. \u201cNGOs like WaterAid like to talk about water much more than sanitation, because it gets more traction \u2013 from supporters, academia, media, celebrities, the government,\u201d Hueso says. \u201cSanitation is not sexy.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"8a6eca43dbe6df6ccf7b6973119ba71d9930c65f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a6eca43dbe6df6ccf7b6973119ba71d9930c65f/0_586_5376_3226/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Outside one of Ambatoantrano\u2019s five churches.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Outside one of Ambatoantrano\u2019s five churches.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elena Heatherwick</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The ready supply of water undoubtedly makes handwashing easier. But long-drop toilets don\u2019t require water to work, only ashes to neutralise the smell. Nevertheless, the effect was dramatic. Latrines appeared, not gradually, but all at once. Mialy Randriamampianina, the head of policy, communications and campaign for WaterAid Madagascar, puts it down to the \u201cintegrated message of water, sanitation and hygiene\u201d. Others say it was peer pressure, and the fact that the community imposed fines on refusers that were enforced by the gendarmes.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The council has funded a team of 12 'poo policemen' who prohibit people from defecating on the beach</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The latrines were funded and designed by the villagers \u2013 an approach, say sanitation experts, that helps to make people feel more invested. Augustin\u2019s is pared-down, like his bachelor home, which is dark and basic even by local standards: no floor covering, only earth; no bed, only a wooden couch hidden behind a rag curtain. He shares his latrine with a neighbour who has a family of nine and who helped build it. It cost about Ar10,000 (\u00a32.20) and has mud walls and a straw roof. Augustin tends to visit early in the morning. \u201cOne person always takes a long time, but I am not going to say who,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Ranoeliarimanana\u2019s daughter, Saholy, in her early 30s, has one of the smartest latrines in Ambatoantrano. She and her husband run the shop-cum-cafe, which sells coffee and noodle soup as well as packs of spaghetti, biscuits, dried fish and plastic bottles of paraffin. They live in an aspirational part of the village, near the money lender\u2019s house, which is bigger and grander than the rest. Her husband gave up his job as a maintenance engineer for the mobile phone company Orange three years ago.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"856872a241f3a16067572707edf883c6e7c9778d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/856872a241f3a16067572707edf883c6e7c9778d/0_47_4653_5816/800.jpg\" alt=\"A mother and son on their way to fish.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A mother and son on their way to fish.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elena Heatherwick</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe were always moving and our two boys were suffering,\u201d she says. The cement floor of her latrine is inlaid with beautiful ceramic tiles, inspired by the more upmarket toilets she saw on her travels.</p> <p>But the latrines have brought new problems. Jeanne Ramanandraisoa, 58, has lost five ducks down the hole over four months. \u201cThey follow the flies,\u201d she says. \u201cWe got three out with a stick, but two died. We need to make the hole smaller.\u201d Her crops, at least, are no longer infected. \u201cNow I can eat what I grow. Before, I could not. There were lots of flies on the sweetcorn, because there were so many people shitting just next to the field.\u201d</p> <p>It is not easy to duplicate the success of Ambatoantrano. Take Morondava, a city in south-west Madagascar. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/21/madagascar\" title=\"\">Andry Rajoelina</a>, the country\u2019s president, who is 45 and once worked as a DJ, proposes making Morondava a new \u201cC\u00f4te d\u2019Azur\u201d, with its beautiful beaches facing the Mozambique channel. But just around the corner from the city\u2019s five-star Palissandre C\u00f4te Ouest hotel is a community of Vezo \u2013 traditional fishermen. The warren of closely packed houses and chaotic alleyways that borders the beach is home to about 5,000 people. Roughly 1% to 2% have a latrine. The rest use the beach.</p> <p>\u201cIt is the habit of the Vezo to come to the beach early in the morning to see the fishermen set off for the day,\u201d says Angeline.

      "bodyText": "The sisters were buried in their favourite clothes: Patricia in a white dress and Mirana in plimsolls, a skirt and a blouse. Patricia was three and loved her Barbie. Not the Barbies that most girls in the village play with \u2013 dolls made from bamboo sticks, with grass \u201chair\u201d tied in elastic bands \u2013 but a real one, with a pink plastic face. Her father, Augustin Randrianasolo, now 62, had bought it a few years earlier from the market for 200 Malagasy ariary (then worth 50p), a lot of money in the early 80s. Mirana died seven years after her sister, in the early 90s; she was two and a half. \u201cNot yet old enough to really speak,\u201d says her older sister, Odile, who is now 35. \u201cShe was the most beautiful of all of us,\u201d she continues. \u201cShe had the nicest hair, the most beautiful face. She looked like my dad.\u201d Patricia and Mirana were two of six girls born to Isabelle and Augustin. They married when Augustin was 20 and Isabelle was 16, and settled in Ambatoantrano, a remote village in the central highlands of Madagascar. Augustin was measured, thoughtful and could read and write. She was a talented seamstress and embroiderer. The sisters died in the rainy season. The village is built on a slope and, when it rains, water streams down the pathways. Today, it is mainly red soil that gets swept into puddles. Back then, it was mixed with human faeces. There were hardly any toilets in the village; until three years ago, most people defecated in the maize fields at the edge of the village, or in the tall grass behind the school. The puddles the children splashed and jumped in were sources of life-threatening disease. Cases of diarrhoea always peaked with the rain, from November to April: children suffered most. Patricia\u2019s death happened very quickly \u2013 three days from the onset of a persistent stomach ache and diarrhoea to death. \u201cWe didn\u2019t pay too much attention at first. Diarrhoea is very common,\u201d her father says. \u201cBut then it got worse.\u201d They tried to take Patricia to the health centre in the next village, but heavy rains cut off the road. They gave her an infusion made from ground guava leaves that she could not keep down, and bought some pills from the village shop. \u201cBut when it\u2019s really bad diarrhoea, these pills don\u2019t work,\u201d he says. Patricia died in the night of profound dehydration. Her parents were stunned. \u201cShe had been there, and then, very suddenly, she went,\u201d Augustin says. His face is full of pain. When Mirana got ill, it took a long time for Odile to understand what was happening. \u201cMy mother wanted to take her to the hospital because she saw how dangerous it was, but my dad wanted to go to his father, a healer, in the village. He gave her some medicine, but my mum didn\u2019t want it. She burnt it.\u201d Finally, they got someone to drive them to the hospital in town, but it was too late. The parents blamed each other and separated a month later. \u201cShe was disappointed about life, about us,\u201d Augustin says of his wife. Isabelle left for a man who was improving the road to the village. She took the four girls and moved to a town 500km away. Although he was only 35 when his wife left, Augustin never remarried. \u201cI decided to live my life alone,\u201d he says. For the past 30 years, he has focused on farming and village affairs; he is currently vice-president of the community, after serving as president for five years. \u201cSometimes when I think about my wife and my daughters I go to the shop and buy something to drink,\u201d he says. Usually Malagasy rum. Odile says all the pain in her family can be traced back to one thing. If there had been toilets in the village, everything would have been different. \u201cMy sisters wouldn\u2019t have died and we would have had a better life.\u201d About 673 million people in the world don\u2019t have sanitation, according to the most recent statistics, published in 2019 by the World Health Organisation and Unicef. Not even a stinking, fly-invested box, or a rickety shack that empties over a ditch \u2013 this counts as sanitation, though of an unsafe variety. The people who have access to this \u2013 701 million people \u2013 are relatively fortunate, compared with those without any latrine, who must defecate in street gutters, behind bushes or into rivers or plastic bags. The impact on health is huge. Diarrhoea caused by faecally contaminated food or water \u2013 nearly 58% of cases \u2013 kills 910,300 people a year: many of them are children. According to Unicef, it is the biggest hurdle that a young child in a developing country must overcome to survive \u2013 bigger than HIV, tuberculosis or malaria. Good sanitation can reduce diarrhoea cases by nearly 35%. It means children are less likely to be off school with tummy ache and girls can attend when they get their periods \u2013 otherwise, what do you do if your school has no toilet? Where good sanitation exists, people are wealthier and healthier. But inserting a good system into a developing country is not easy. \u201cIt is critical not only to have a functioning government but one that prioritises sanitation,\u201d says Andr\u00e9s Hueso, senior policy analyst for WaterAid. Brazil, for example, has increased its military spending over the past decade, but reduced its investment in water and sewage systems, despite having a sanitation ranking of 112 out of 200 countries in the most recent survey by the World Bank, in 2014. Treating the resulting diseases cost Brazil nearly $25m (\u00a320m) in 2017 alone. To make a lasting change requires more than a high-level political push, Hueso says. \u201cYou need real work at grassroots level, and behavioural change.\u201d Defecating in the open is as old as humankind \u2013 and a practice that is still celebrated in countries such as Madagascar with startling fervour. \u201cMen will say: \u2018I like going in the fresh air. I like the walk in the morning. I like socialising with my friends when I go in the open,\u2019\u201d Hueso says. \u201cBut very rarely will women say they enjoy it.\u201d Going to the toilet outdoors is dangerous and embarrassing for women and girls. In many communities, modesty requires that they get up at 4am to do it under the cover of darkness, leaving them vulnerable to sexual assault and snakes. \u201cIn almost every developing country, you will hear women say: I go at night, so people don\u2019t see me. I always go with a friend, so she can keep an eye on people prying,\u201d he says. Only one road connects Ambatoantrano to the nearest town of Ts\u2019didy. The drive takes two hours, snaking over mountainous terrain. The village is home to about 2,000 people, none of whom own a car. Only three have a motorbike. Augustin, like most people in the village, gets around on a bicycle; it takes him three hours to cycle to Ts\u2019didy \u2013 longer when the rains turn the road into a quagmire. It is a pre-industrial life. People depend on the land, with dozens heading off to work in the fields as morning breaks, having been woken by cockerels. The women, young and old, are always working \u2013 pulling weeds from the ground, crouching in the red dust to pound rice, hanging washing out to dry on bushes and trees. With no toy shops or TV, children make up their own games. Boys play marbles with rounded pebbles or guava stones; girls plait skipping ropes from the long grass at the edge of the village. There are cattle-drawn carts and guinea pigs are food, not pets. Getting mobile coverage is a laborious process, as the sole hotspot is by a tree in the centre of the village. There are more churches (five) than shops (three) and the congregations gather for Sunday morning services that last for three hours. Raymond Razafiarison, 63, the pastor of the Lutheran church, is one of only a few people in the village to have solar power. And yet Ambatoantrano bucks a trend in Madagascar. In the country as a whole, fewer than 10% of households have a private toilet \u2013 among the lowest rates of sanitation in the world. In rural areas, these numbers are even lower; people are more likely to use a mobile phone than a loo. But here, nearly 98% of households have their own toilet. Despite having no electricity or sewage works, it has higher sanitation levels than Bulgaria, thanks to the efforts of NGOs and charities over the past two years. Aurelie Ranoeliarimanana, 56, was one of the first in the village to get a latrine. She is now the head of a church\u2019s women\u2019s association and is wearing her church finery (black patent shoes with buckles) when we meet one Sunday morning. Her childhood ambition was to be a midwife, although a lack of money held her back. \u201cI had an aunt who was a doctor in a hospital and she allowed me to do a kind of internship. Because I wanted to work in the health sector, I knew that a latrine and a bathroom were really important.\u201d She remembers the early 80s, when many young villagers died after having diarrhoea. \u201cWe kept on burying children, maybe 10 a year at that time,\u201d she says. They included her own nieces, who were aged one and three. In 1997, pastor Razafiarison led the funeral service for his granddaughter, who died when she was barely four weeks old. \u201cShe had diarrhoea, continuous diarrhoea,\u201d he says. Her name was Tafita. \u201cIt means succeed,\u201d he says. Ranoeliarimanana\u2019s first latrine dates from when she was newly married, in 1979. It was similar to the pit or long-drop toilets built in the village today. These have three components \u2013 a deep hole in the ground; a concrete slab or mud floor with a small hole (sometimes laid with two bricks squatting distance apart); and a shelter \u2013 and are built close to the house (but not too close, because of the stench). A pit toilet is ideal for places without water or sewers, because the faeces compost in the deep hole. When it is full, after four years or so, the owner digs another one and starts again. Ranoeliarimanana talks with pride of her many latrines and how, even 10 years ago, they were a rarity. In 2016, only about 5% of families had a latrine. The turning point was the arrival of water in early 2017, from a source seven miles away, thanks to a gravity flow system and \u00a370,000 from WaterAid. This meant women no longer had to make the long walk to collect water from the river. It meant fundraising photographs could be taken of water gushing from the village\u2019s tap stands. \u201cNGOs like WaterAid like to talk about water much more than sanitation, because it gets more traction \u2013 from supporters, academia, media, celebrities, the government,\u201d Hueso says. \u201cSanitation is not sexy.\u201d The ready supply of water undoubtedly makes handwashing easier. But long-drop toilets don\u2019t require water to work, only ashes to neutralise the smell. Nevertheless, the effect was dramatic. Latrines appeared, not gradually, but all at once. Mialy Randriamampianina, the head of policy, communications and campaign for WaterAid Madagascar, puts it down to the \u201cintegrated message of water, sanitation and hygiene\u201d. Others say it was peer pressure, and the fact that the community imposed fines on refusers that were enforced by the gendarmes. The latrines were funded and designed by the villagers \u2013 an approach, say sanitation experts, that helps to make people feel more invested. Augustin\u2019s is pared-down, like his bachelor home, which is dark and basic even by local standards: no floor covering, only earth; no bed, only a wooden couch hidden behind a rag curtain. He shares his latrine with a neighbour who has a family of nine and who helped build it. It cost about Ar10,000 (\u00a32.20) and has mud walls and a straw roof. Augustin tends to visit early in the morning. \u201cOne person always takes a long time, but I am not going to say who,\u201d he says. Ranoeliarimanana\u2019s daughter, Saholy, in her early 30s, has one of the smartest latrines in Ambatoantrano. She and her husband run the shop-cum-cafe, which sells coffee and noodle soup as well as packs of spaghetti, biscuits, dried fish and plastic bottles of paraffin. They live in an aspirational part of the village, near the money lender\u2019s house, which is bigger and grander than the rest. Her husband gave up his job as a maintenance engineer for the mobile phone company Orange three years ago. \u201cWe were always moving and our two boys were suffering,\u201d she says. The cement floor of her latrine is inlaid with beautiful ceramic tiles, inspired by the more upmarket toilets she saw on her travels. But the latrines have brought new problems. Jeanne Ramanandraisoa, 58, has lost five ducks down the hole over four months. \u201cThey follow the flies,\u201d she says. \u201cWe got three out with a stick, but two died. We need to make the hole smaller.\u201d Her crops, at least, are no longer infected. \u201cNow I can eat what I grow. Before, I could not. There were lots of flies on the sweetcorn, because there were so many people shitting just next to the field.\u201d It is not easy to duplicate the success of Ambatoantrano. Take Morondava, a city in south-west Madagascar. Andry Rajoelina, the country\u2019s president, who is 45 and once worked as a DJ, proposes making Morondava a new \u201cC\u00f4te d\u2019Azur\u201d, with its beautiful beaches facing the Mozambique channel. But just around the corner from the city\u2019s five-star Palissandre C\u00f4te Ouest hotel is a community of Vezo \u2013 traditional fishermen. The warren of closely packed houses and chaotic alleyways that borders the beach is home to about 5,000 people. Roughly 1% to 2% have a latrine. The rest use the beach. \u201cIt is the habit of the Vezo to come to the beach early in the morning to see the fishermen set off for the day,\u201d says Angeline. She is married to a fisherman and has five children, aged 12 to 28. Dawn is also the time when people relieve themselves. \u201cThat is one of the places,\u201d she says, pointing to some rocks. The toilet seems to span the entire length of the beach. The contrast between the beauty of the surroundings \u2013 the beach in the golden light; pirogues, boats made from a hollowed-out log, each powered by a hand-stitched sail, being manoeuvred into the sea \u2013 and the sight of people squatting down is surreal. \u201cIt does annoy us,\u201d Angeline says. \u201cSometimes when we are catching shrimp [with small nets] there is poo in there, too.\u201d Patrice Paul Tiandrainy, 25, a fisherman and health agent for a local NGO, says human faeces is also a problem further out to sea, where it is carried by the waves into fishing nets. He says he catches faeces along with the crabs, lobsters and tuna fish, about once a week. Arguments against building latrines include lack of space and traditional beliefs. It is \u201cfady [taboo] to store your shit\u201d, Tiandrainy explains. \u201cIt\u2019s like you are considering it as wealth, and you should only save money.\u201d There is also the cost. The Morondava area is too cramped for pit latrines. Private companies sell latrines with a proper cistern and cement floor, but the cost is upwards of Ar200,000. Tiandrainy used to go to a public toilet in the centre of town. \u201cBut nobody maintained it and it got broken.\u201d Kolo Fritjob, the mayor of Morondava, agrees a \u201csanitary block\u201d on the beach front is an answer, but he has the budget to build only one latrine a year. He receives no money from central government for sanitation. \u201cIt is not their priority,\u201d he explains. \u201cPensions, education, health \u2013 they have money for those things, but not for water, sanitation and hygiene.\u201d Fritjob says the council has funded a team of 12 \u201cpoo policemen\u201d who prohibit people from defecating on the beach.

How did you and Jordan come to be involved? </h2> <p><strong>Danielle </strong>Chips With Everything was the idea of the former producer Matt Shaw, who wanted to change the format of the original Tech Weekly podcast so it was more about digital culture and how technology influences society, or vice versa. I met a former producer for a coffee and mentioned I had worked on a tech podcast in New York, and a week later I met the former head of audio Jason Phipps, who invited me to join the team.</p> <p><strong>Jordan </strong>My area of expertise is video games, and I used to write about them regularly for the Guardian. Back when the Guardian\u2019s tech podcast was called Tech Weekly, we occasionally did a video games takeover, and I was invited on as a guest presenter. Jason Phipps said I was a natural and I guess when Chips needed a new presenter he thought of me.</p> <h2>How do you decide what to focus on in each instalment?</h2> <p><strong>Danielle </strong>It\u2019s a mixed bag. Sometimes we look to the news for inspiration, particularly when legislation has been passed that will affect tech users, or if big tech companies have hit the headlines for some reason. Other times, we focus on the weird and wonderful stories, such as when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/audio/2019/apr/01/how-to-catch-a-catfisher-chips-with-everything-podcast\">Max Benwell</a> spent a year looking for a man catfishing women online using Max\u2019s face. Jordan is great at suggesting particularly niche stories.</p> <p><strong>Jordan </strong>I send Danielle interesting stories when I see them, but she does the vast majority of the planning. She\u2019s incredible. I don\u2019t know how she does it.</p> <h2>What do you enjoy most about making the pod?</h2> <p><strong>Danielle </strong>Not to be corny, but I love working with Jordan and getting to meet some incredibly interesting people. I like that we cover stories that some listeners have said they didn\u2019t know they <em>wanted </em>to know. It\u2019s a fun show.</p> <p><strong>Jordan </strong>Sometimes a particular topic or an individual\u2019s story will just hit me, whether it\u2019s taught me something entirely new or given me a new perspective on something. I love it when we cover topics other people aren\u2019t, such as our episode on the relationship between technology and Barbie. And I\u2019m so lucky to meet so many interesting people, including some real heroes.</p> <h2>What are the big challenges of covering the tech world?</h2> <p><strong>Danielle </strong>It\u2019s quite difficult to get big tech companies, or even startups, to want to have an in-depth conversation about some of the potentially negative ways their companies can affect society. It\u2019s a PR-driven industry, so it\u2019s a challenge to pick the stories from the pitches.</p> <p><strong>Jordan </strong>Technology can obviously move really fast, but sometimes it feels as if we\u2019re seeing the same story again and again, especially around things such as privacy and the pace of legislation.</p> <h2>Do you have a favourite episode or guest?</h2> <p><strong>Danielle </strong>One of my favourite episodes was when we had the journalist and author Hussein Kesvani on the show to talk about the time he met one of the many Islamophobic trolls he interacts with on Twitter every day. The story was eye-opening and just one of the many anecdotes he wrote as part of his new book, which looked at British Muslims growing up in the age of the internet. My favourite shows are those that I feel our listeners will say \u201chuh, I never knew that\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Jordan </strong>I loved the episode on the relationship between technology and Barbie, because we got into some really interesting discussions about gender. And I got to talk to Jesyca Durchin-Schnepp, who produced movies I used to watch with my little sister. The episode about how Norad tracks Santa was a joy to make, too. I was so excited when Danielle first told me her idea for that.</p> <h2>What have been the highlights and challenges?</h2> <p><strong>Danielle </strong>Highlights for me are when Jordan and I record in the field. I loved going to see PlayStation in Concert at the Royal Albert Hall, for example. It has been lovely getting to know Jordan and she teaches me something new about video games every week. Finally, one of the best parts of doing the show is getting the feedback from listeners all over the world. We\u2019ve received emails from Argentina, Australia and Pakistan \u2013 it\u2019s exciting to think our show is reaching that far.</p> <p><strong>Jordan </strong>One of the biggest highlights has been working with Danielle, who is not only an incredible producer but also a friend. As for challenges, the most obvious one is time. Danielle gets two days per episode, and I get one. So on that one day we write questions, conduct a couple of interviews, write a script, and record it. We often end up having to write the script before we\u2019ve even done all the interviews, so that our head of audio has time to check it. If an interviewee doesn\u2019t show up we don\u2019t really have time to find a replacement. We pull it off 90% of the time, because Danielle is amazing, but it can be really stressful.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d4d6ac5b75400c165962f3ab6aa4fc95f9bcd48a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d4d6ac5b75400c165962f3ab6aa4fc95f9bcd48a/0_54_4606_2764/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Norad\u2019s \u2018Santa tracking\u2019 operation at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Norad\u2019s \u2018Santa tracking\u2019 operation at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brennan Linsley/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>What can we do to make sure Big Tech is held to account on privacy and data security?</h2> <p><strong>Danielle </strong>Legislation is key. Looking at the US 2020 election now, I\u2019d love someone to ask them how they would protect their elections from being hacked in the future, how they would hold Silicon Valley to account, and how they would use cyberwarfare in future. We probably won\u2019t see the question asked, but until this type of protection is seen as a preventative measure and not a retrospective \u201clet\u2019s just break up big tech\u201d, nothing will change and individuals will have less and less autonomy over their data.</p> <p><strong>Jordan </strong>We need to legislate. And we are legislating \u2013 but governments are slow to act. And before they act, they are slow to understand. Our representatives need to educate themselves. Maybe they should listen to Chips!</p> <h2>Do you get much chance to interact with listeners?</h2> <p><strong>Danielle </strong>As I mentioned, we get a lot of emails in telling us how much they like show and it\u2019s something I want to capitalise on in future.</p> <p><strong>Jordan </strong>We always ask for listeners to email us, and they do. But I especially love it when we bump into a listener in public. We met one on the tube once who recognised my voice, which was awesome.</p> <h2>Which technological advancement are you most excited about \u2013 and which most concerns you?</h2> <p><strong>Danielle </strong>I am surprised every week by a piece of technology that is aiming to \u2013 or is already \u2013 solving medical problems. Any technology that can make a person who has a medical condition that bit easier, or can make a surgical procedure more precise, is incredibly exciting. On the flip side, apps that are readily available on the Play store or Apple store that allow one individual to track another terrify me.</p> <p><strong>Jordan </strong>I\u2019m most excited by technology that is being developed to help tackle existing problems, and I\u2019m most concerned about technology that creates new ones.</p> <h2>Is there a particular tech trend you wish would come back?</h2> <p><strong>Danielle </strong>I miss the excitement of transferring a song to a mate by connecting through Bluetooth and holding our phones very close together.</p> <p><strong>Jordan </strong>I kind of miss when you couldn\u2019t be online all the time.</p> <h2>Which Guardian journalist(s) do you most admire?</h2> <p><strong>Danielle </strong>I really love reading anything that Julia Carrie Wong writes, as well as our very own Alex Hern, who I\u2019m pretty sure knows everything about tech.</p> <p><strong>Jordan </strong>Alex Hern is a friend, but he\u2019s also a really impressive journalist. He\u2019s always an excellent podcast guest too. Outside of tech, I admire those journalists who pursue long investigations into stories other people aren\u2019t covering \u2013 I\u2019m glad the Guardian supports that kind of journalism.</p> <h2>What makes our tech coverage different?</h2> <p><strong>Danielle </strong>I like that we hold people to account. I think Carole Cadwalladr is the perfect example of this. I can only imagine how much abuse she got, but the Guardian and Observer<em> </em>stood by her and that\u2019s hugely comforting.</p> <p><strong>Jordan </strong>I think tech coverage can often fall into either enthusiastic coverage of the latest shiny gadget or scornful luddism about \u201ckids these days\u201d. Hopefully we manage to ask questions of tech from an informed perspective.</p> <p><br><br></p>",

It doesn\u2019t contain sun protection, but layered well over the top of all the sunscreens I tried. Finally, if you just can\u2019t be parted from foundation, rain or shine, the answer lies in IT Cosmetics\u2019 CC+ Illumination SPF50 (\u00a331, 32ml). Cruelty free, lots of glow, numerous shades, heaps of (mineral) sun protection \u2013 and coverage that just won\u2019t quit, even on rosacea and acne. \u2022 Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure the discussion remains on the topics raised by the article.

      "body": "<p>As a boy, David Shariatmadari would sit in the hallway and listen to his Iranian father speaking Farsi on the phone to his family in Tehran. It was an early introduction to the estranging beauty of unfamiliar language. So began an interest in linguistics that has given birth to this book, a skilful summation of the latest research on how languages emerge, change, convey meaning and influence how we think.</p> <p>Each chapter explodes a common myth about language. Shariatmadari begins with the most common myth: that standards of English are declining. This is a centuries-old lament for which, he points out, there has never been any evidence. Older people buy into the myth because young people, who are more mobile and have wider social networks, are innovators in language as in other walks of life. Their habit of saying \u201caks\u201d instead of \u201cask\u201d, for instance, is a perfectly respectable example of metathesis, a natural linguistic process where the sounds in words swap round. (The word \u201cwasp\u201d used to be \u201cwaps\u201d and \u201chorse\u201d used to be \u201chros\u201d.) Youth is the driver of linguistic change. This means that older people feel linguistic alienation even as they control the institutions \u2013 universities, publishers, newspapers, broadcasters \u2013 that define standard English.</p> <p>Another myth Shariatmadari dismantles is that foreign languages are full of untranslatable words. This misconception serves to exoticise other nationalities and cultures, making them sound quaint or bizarre. It amuses us to think that there are 27 words for eyebrow in Albanian. But we only really think this because of our grammar-blindness about Albanian, which can easily form adjectival compounds by joining two words together.</p> <p>Languages do shape how we think and act, but this usually happens not at the level of vocabulary but of linguistic structure. The psycholinguist John Lucy has given language as one explanation for the starkly different rates of workplace accidents in Sweden and Finland. In Swedish, prepositions allow for the nuanced account of actions over time; in Finnish, case endings stress static relationships. This may make Finns less alert to the temporal arrangement of a process, leading to more interruptions and accidents at work.</p> <p>Shariatmadari borrows from Iris Murdoch\u2019s idea of language as a net cast over the mind, constraining our thoughts according to how its knots and threads land \u2013 wrinkled in some places, straight in others. Every language is a different throw of the net. Language sieves and strains reality but never imprisons it. There are always holes for the real world to escape.</p> <p>Shariatmadari\u2019s general approach to language is pro-diversity and anti-pedantry. No linguist would disagree with his argument that a word\u2019s meaning depends not on its etymology but on how it is used. (Adam Gopnik once wrote that prescriptivism was \u201cas bogus a concept in linguistics as green cheese is in astronomy\u201d.) But he fleshes out this argument usefully, offering ammunition against the tiresome hairsplitter who, for example, insists that \u201cdecimate\u201d comes from the Roman practice of executing every tenth soldier as a collective punishment. (It doesn\u2019t.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Words aren\u2019t a condiment you sprinkle on top of reality; they are the marinade that alters the taste of\u00a0everything</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He also rescues nonstandard forms, such as African American Vernacular English (AAVE), from the routine condescension meted out to them. AAVE misses out the linking \u201cto be\u201d verb (\u201cyou late\u201d) but then so do many other languages. The AAVE construction \u201che be singing\u201d does not mean \u201che is singing\u201d but \u201che sings [as a hobby, professionally]\u201d. It is an efficient means of marking the habitual aspect. \u201cImma\u201d for \u201cI\u2019m going to\u201d is another standard linguistic move: cutting a word or phrase that is just a grammatical marker. \u201cImma\u201d doesn\u2019t work with the more literal sense of \u201cgoing to\u201d, which is why you can say \u201cImma let you finish\u201d (I\u2019m going to let you finish) but not \u201cImma the shops\u201d (I\u2019m going to the shops).</p> <p>All languages move naturally towards abbreviation and compression, guided by what the linguist Rudi Keller calls \u201cthe invisible hand in language change\u201d.

Robert Borsak, one of two SFFP upper house MPs, told Guardian Australia on Saturday that the party would not support the bill without amendments aimed at preventing what he called \u201csex selection\u201d, despite all three of its lower house MPs voting in favour of the bill when it passed on Thursday. \u201cWe want to see amendments put in that will stop those sorts of things happening, but based on what happened in the lower house we\u2019re not optimistic that\u2019s going to happen so I think it will inevitably lead to a situation where we vote against it,\u201d he said. During the debate on the bill in the lower house, the conservative Liberal party MP Tanya Davies sought to include an amendment stating that terminations not \u201cbe used for gender selection\u201d. The amendment was rejected because, opponents said, it was unnecessary and unworkable. The attorney general, Mark Speakman, who voted against both against the amendment and the bill itself, said in parliament that the Davies amendment was \u201cnot in an appropriate state\u201d. \u201cIt is one thing to say that, if a doctor knows that sex selection is proposed, the doctor should not participate,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is unclear from this draft just what duty is to be imposed on a doctor in relation to sex selection because the drafting suggests that if the parents are sex selecting it is against the law for the doctor to be involved. What obligation should that doctor have? I do not think that is something that we can determine on the run.\u201d He also pointed out there was little if any evidence sex selection was an issue in NSW, and that there would be \u201cisolated cases\u201d where decisions regarding \u201cvery serious genetic conditions\u201d that could be \u201cconnected with sex selection\u201d. Instead, members agreed to an amendment by Nationals MP Leslie Williams to require the health ministry to review whether there was any evidence of sex selection occurring and to report back within 12 months. But Borsak said he was not satisfied with that change, and that he also had issues around \u201clate-term\u201d abortions and conscientious objections for doctors which he would move amendments on. Asked how a provision around sex selection would work, he said he was not sure. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to sit down and think that through,\u201d he said. But even if the SFFP MPs do not support the bill, Borsak is not confident he would have the numbers to block it passing when it comes to the upper house in just over a week. Christian Democrat Fred Nile will move amendments to the bill and not support it, as will One Nation\u2019s Mark Latham. As many as six of the 11 Liberal party upper house MPs are understood to be opposed to the bill.",

The trees had long gone, as I had been warned, pulled down by developers to make way for more housing. But the lane to Oak Tree Farm was exactly the same.

      "body": "<p>For her summer holiday this year, Anna Hughes, 36, is cycling from London to Nice, stopping in Paris, Nevers, Lyon, and Provence along the 700-mile route. To return, she\u2019s jumping on the TGV in Nice, arriving back in London around nine hours later. Hughes is one of the trailblazers for flight-free holidays, avoiding gas-guzzling planes for the past decade, and is now director of <a href=\"https://www.flightfree.co.uk/\">Flight Free UK</a>, a campaign group encouraging people to take a no-fly year in 2020.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t fly because it\u2019s about the worst thing an individual can do for the environment,\u201d says Hughes. \u201cEven if you take other steps to be environmentally friendly, like recycling everything, using green energy, or even becoming vegan, one flight can wipe out all your savings. A flight is pretty much the most carbon-heavy thing you can buy.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A long-haul flight produces more emissions than the average person generates in a whole year</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>According to recent Guardian analysis, a long-haul flight produces more carbon emissions than the average person in dozens of countries around the world generates in a whole year. Travelling by train or ferry is significantly kinder to the environment: for instance, the Eurostar from London to Paris produces 4.1kg CO<sub>2</sub> per passenger per person compared to 63.6kg by flying, according to the high-speed rail service.</p> <p>In the face of a climate emergency, increasing numbers of people are chosing to ditch planes. While there are legitimate concerns about the additional time and cost, travelling by train to some parts of Europe can end up being a similar price to flying (and minus the headache of hanging around at the airport). Take Hughes\u2019s rail journey from Nice to London, which cost \u00a3102. The cheapest one-way flights we could find for an August weekend were \u00a3140, although they drop to between \u00a360 and \u00a380 in September.</p> <p>On a return trip from London to Dublin earlier this year, Hughes travelled on a one-way Rail &amp; Sail train and ferry ticket that cost her \u00a350. Looking at prices for next week, Guardian Money found that leaving London at midday and arriving at Dublin Ferry port at 7pm costs around \u00a343.50 for departures scheduled during next week. The cheapest equivalent flights to Dublin are selling at about \u00a345 one way, without the typical \u00a310 to \u00a320 cost to get to the airport.</p> <p>\u201cI live in London and that\u2019s an easy transport hub, but given the extra costs of airport transfers, going to Dublin by train was cheaper than flying. People think flying is cheaper, but it isn\u2019t always,\u201d says Hughes.</p> <p>While flights at off-peak times are generally cheaper than trains, it is often the case that travelling at peak holiday times is cheaper by train.</p> <p>There\u2019s also the added benefit of saving on expensive airport transfers. A peak and off-peak express train from Heathrow to Paddington costs \u00a325 each way, while a return is \u00a337. A single standard ticket from Liverpool Street station to Stansted is \u00a318.90; a standard return is \u00a329.90.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0fee192231b15ff66ef9f3d7f8b4e0569571d468\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0fee192231b15ff66ef9f3d7f8b4e0569571d468/0_157_3800_2280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The tiled interior of the recently restored S\u00e3o Bento railway station in Porto, Portugal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The tiled interior of the recently restored S\u00e3o Bento railway station in Porto, Portugal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Greenberg/Universal Images Group via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, London is, of course, a much easier transport hub than most other parts of the UK, meaning people living outside the capital would have to consider the price of train tickets if travelling on Eurostar. However, no matter where we\u2019re located in the UK, most fliers are burdened by the extra fees.</p> <p>Ryanair charges \u00a325 to \u00a335 to check in a 20kg bag on a one-way flight. When Guardian Money looked to book an EasyJet return flight from London Gatwick to Madrid for August, the original price came in at \u00a354.79, but eventually rose to \u00a393.77 when including a \u00a319.49 fee for 23kg of baggage each way. And that\u2019s not all. Want to choose where you\u2019ll sit on an EasyJet flight? That\u2019ll be \u00a38.49, thank you.</p> <p>For their summer holiday this year, Abigail Thomas, 37, producer and co-presenter of <a href=\"https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/abigail-thomas/the-hopeful-activists-podcast\" title=\"\">The Hopeful Activists\u2019 Podcast</a>, and her husband and three children aged eight, six and four, are travelling by train to Switzerland. They say it will cost a little more, but they are having a very different experience. \u201cOur children are becoming passionate about the environment through their school so it seemed a natural step,\u201d says Thomas, who lives in Bradford.</p> <p>She outlines the cost implications: \u201cWe\u2019re using an Interrail pass for our train travel on the continent, which will cost \u20ac575 (\u00a3515) as you get two children free on each pass. Our Eurostar tickets, discounted by the pass, are an additional \u00a3265.\u201d</p> <p>The family also plans to make pit-stops in Brussels and Basel. \u201cWe could have had a package holiday cheaper if we were flying, but doing it this way we have a much more interesting holiday.\u201d</p> <p>Mark Smith, founder of the train ticketing information site Seat61.com, believes taking the train to parts of Europe is on the verge of becoming mainstream. \u201cThis is a grass-roots movement \u2013 it\u2019s not coming from the travel industry, which is set up to book flights, car hire and more flights and would rather people flew.</p> <p>\u201cNor is it coming from the rail industry, which needs to work together more to facilitate this if they want to benefit fully in terms of easy booking systems, and passenger rights when delays mean a missed connection.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the lack of coordination, he says travelling by train can be affordable. \u201cThey have their cheap fares if you book in advance at the right website. For example, you can travel from London to Paris from \u00a358 return, Paris to Venice from \u20ac29, or London to Berlin from \u00a369.90.\u201d</p> <p>There are also plenty of offers at Rail &amp; Sail, which combines train and ferry travel in one ticket. StenaLine offers ferry and rail trips such as Harwich in Essex to any Dutch station from \u00a349 one-way for an adult and \u00a324.50 for a child. Guardian Money found a Manchester Victoria to Dublin Ferryport ticket, taking five hours 53 minutes door to door, for \u00a339.50. Alexandra Jellicoe, 41, who lives in Bath and is an environmental scientist and blogger at Monkey Wrench, is one of the 2,000 people to have so far signed up to the Flight Free UK campaign. She admits she was a frequent flier up until April this year when she started feeling uncomfortable about the amount of air miles she was racking up.</p> <p>\u201cI was aware that climate change was a big problem, and I was doing my best at home to lead an eco-conscious lifestyle. But I have always lived abroad and travelled extensively for work and leisure, so flying was a fixed part of my routine.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019d got stuck in a routine of hopping on a cheap flight from Bristol and limited ourselves to places we could access from there.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/08/uk-train-operators-reverse-interrail-quit-decision\">UK train operators reverse decision to quit Interrail</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This summer the family of five \u2013 husband Matt and three children aged seven and under \u2013 will take the train to Annecy in France, in a trip costing \u00a31,171 and booked through train booking platform Loco2.</p> <p>Jellicoe says a return flight from Bristol to Geneva at the same time, plus connections to the airport at each end, would have cost \u00a31,154. \u201cWhen you start to think about carbon emissions as part of your decision-making process, you start to travel in different ways \u2013 where can I get to by train and which routes are easiest and cheapest.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a different set of limitations but equally exciting. Rather than a weekend, or a week here or there, we\u2019ll plan to go for two to four weeks. And if we only have a short time we\u2019ll holiday closer to home.\u201d</p> <p>Jasmine Salter, 27, based between London and Scotland, used to fly three to four times a year but has radically changed since listening to an Extinction Rebellion talk in November last year.</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t flown since,\u201d says Salter, who volunteers full-time for Extinction Rebellion. Instead she\u2019s choosing the bus and hitchhiking. Recent trips include a 24-hour bus to Geneva at about \u00a340 with an overnight stop at a hostel in Paris for \u00a317. \u201cThe difference is how long it takes which makes enjoying the journey part of the adventure,\u201d says Salter. \u201cThere has to be a change in the way we value things.\u201d</p>",

In the face of a climate emergency, increasing numbers of people are chosing to ditch planes. While there are legitimate concerns about the additional time and cost, travelling by train to some parts of Europe can end up being a similar price to flying (and minus the headache of hanging around at the airport). Take Hughes\u2019s rail journey from Nice to London, which cost \u00a3102. The cheapest one-way flights we could find for an August weekend were \u00a3140, although they drop to between \u00a360 and \u00a380 in September. On a return trip from London to Dublin earlier this year, Hughes travelled on a one-way Rail &amp; Sail train and ferry ticket that cost her \u00a350. Looking at prices for next week, Guardian Money found that leaving London at midday and arriving at Dublin Ferry port at 7pm costs around \u00a343.50 for departures scheduled during next week. The cheapest equivalent flights to Dublin are selling at about \u00a345 one way, without the typical \u00a310 to \u00a320 cost to get to the airport. \u201cI live in London and that\u2019s an easy transport hub, but given the extra costs of airport transfers, going to Dublin by train was cheaper than flying. People think flying is cheaper, but it isn\u2019t always,\u201d says Hughes. While flights at off-peak times are generally cheaper than trains, it is often the case that travelling at peak holiday times is cheaper by train. There\u2019s also the added benefit of saving on expensive airport transfers. A peak and off-peak express train from Heathrow to Paddington costs \u00a325 each way, while a return is \u00a337. A single standard ticket from Liverpool Street station to Stansted is \u00a318.90; a standard return is \u00a329.90. However, London is, of course, a much easier transport hub than most other parts of the UK, meaning people living outside the capital would have to consider the price of train tickets if travelling on Eurostar. However, no matter where we\u2019re located in the UK, most fliers are burdened by the extra fees. Ryanair charges \u00a325 to \u00a335 to check in a 20kg bag on a one-way flight. When Guardian Money looked to book an EasyJet return flight from London Gatwick to Madrid for August, the original price came in at \u00a354.79, but eventually rose to \u00a393.77 when including a \u00a319.49 fee for 23kg of baggage each way. And that\u2019s not all. Want to choose where you\u2019ll sit on an EasyJet flight? That\u2019ll be \u00a38.49, thank you. For their summer holiday this year, Abigail Thomas, 37, producer and co-presenter of The Hopeful Activists\u2019 Podcast, and her husband and three children aged eight, six and four, are travelling by train to Switzerland. They say it will cost a little more, but they are having a very different experience. \u201cOur children are becoming passionate about the environment through their school so it seemed a natural step,\u201d says Thomas, who lives in Bradford. She outlines the cost implications: \u201cWe\u2019re using an Interrail pass for our train travel on the continent, which will cost \u20ac575 (\u00a3515) as you get two children free on each pass. Our Eurostar tickets, discounted by the pass, are an additional \u00a3265.\u201d The family also plans to make pit-stops in Brussels and Basel. \u201cWe could have had a package holiday cheaper if we were flying, but doing it this way we have a much more interesting holiday.\u201d Mark Smith, founder of the train ticketing information site Seat61.com, believes taking the train to parts of Europe is on the verge of becoming mainstream. \u201cThis is a grass-roots movement \u2013 it\u2019s not coming from the travel industry, which is set up to book flights, car hire and more flights and would rather people flew. \u201cNor is it coming from the rail industry, which needs to work together more to facilitate this if they want to benefit fully in terms of easy booking systems, and passenger rights when delays mean a missed connection.\u201d Despite the lack of coordination, he says travelling by train can be affordable. \u201cThey have their cheap fares if you book in advance at the right website. For example, you can travel from London to Paris from \u00a358 return, Paris to Venice from \u20ac29, or London to Berlin from \u00a369.90.\u201d There are also plenty of offers at Rail &amp; Sail, which combines train and ferry travel in one ticket. StenaLine offers ferry and rail trips such as Harwich in Essex to any Dutch station from \u00a349 one-way for an adult and \u00a324.50 for a child. Guardian Money found a Manchester Victoria to Dublin Ferryport ticket, taking five hours 53 minutes door to door, for \u00a339.50. Alexandra Jellicoe, 41, who lives in Bath and is an environmental scientist and blogger at Monkey Wrench, is one of the 2,000 people to have so far signed up to the Flight Free UK campaign. She admits she was a frequent flier up until April this year when she started feeling uncomfortable about the amount of air miles she was racking up. \u201cI was aware that climate change was a big problem, and I was doing my best at home to lead an eco-conscious lifestyle. But I have always lived abroad and travelled extensively for work and leisure, so flying was a fixed part of my routine. \u201cWe\u2019d got stuck in a routine of hopping on a cheap flight from Bristol and limited ourselves to places we could access from there.\u201d This summer the family of five \u2013 husband Matt and three children aged seven and under \u2013 will take the train to Annecy in France, in a trip costing \u00a31,171 and booked through train booking platform Loco2. Jellicoe says a return flight from Bristol to Geneva at the same time, plus connections to the airport at each end, would have cost \u00a31,154. \u201cWhen you start to think about carbon emissions as part of your decision-making process, you start to travel in different ways \u2013 where can I get to by train and which routes are easiest and cheapest. \u201cIt\u2019s a different set of limitations but equally exciting. Rather than a weekend, or a week here or there, we\u2019ll plan to go for two to four weeks. And if we only have a short time we\u2019ll holiday closer to home.\u201d Jasmine Salter, 27, based between London and Scotland, used to fly three to four times a year but has radically changed since listening to an Extinction Rebellion talk in November last year. \u201cI haven\u2019t flown since,\u201d says Salter, who volunteers full-time for Extinction Rebellion. Instead she\u2019s choosing the bus and hitchhiking. Recent trips include a 24-hour bus to Geneva at about \u00a340 with an overnight stop at a hostel in Paris for \u00a317. \u201cThe difference is how long it takes which makes enjoying the journey part of the adventure,\u201d says Salter. \u201cThere has to be a change in the way we value things.\u201d",

But while his audience perspired in the oppressive August sun, cooling themselves with paper fans, Biden seemed at ease.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/09/black-women-deserve-better-from-kamala-harris-dont-take-our-vote-for-granted\">Black women deserve better from Kamala Harris.

But at events like this, where his \u201cUncle Joe\u201d folksiness fits right in, Biden seemed in his element \u2013 which is ironic, considering it was here, at the Iowa state fair in Des Moines, where his first campaign for president fell apart more than three decades ago.</p> <p>Speaking at the fair in 1987, Biden was found to have plagiarized a huge chunk of his closing remarks from a speech by the British Labour leader, Neil Kinnock. The scandal killed his campaign; he dropped his bid for the 1988 Democratic nod a month after it broke.</p> <p>But this time around Biden has appeared more robust \u2013 even as the blunders have kept coming. He has endured two rounds or mostly poorly reviewed debate performances, rode out a scandal over inappropriate touching of women, flip-flopped on abortion policy and committed numerous faux pas. Last week alone he got the place names of two mass shootings wrong and then inadvertently told a mostly minority crowd at an Iowa event: \u201cPoor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I thought he was good. But he didn\u2019t address any of the underlying issues</p> <footer> <cite>Edward Rosson</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yet, entering the race as the presumptive frontrunner, Biden has comfortably led the field since \u2013 and even some of those who don\u2019t support him view him as the inevitable nominee.</p> <p>\u201cI think he is the de facto strongest candidate,\u201d said Alan Collinge, a Washington state native who attended Biden\u2019s soapbox address but doesn\u2019t see the former vice-president as his preferred choice.</p> <p>Biden enjoys broad name recognition, access to a major donor network, and is beloved by the Democratic establishment. But that establishment increasingly seems to have fallen out of favor with the younger, more progressive wing of the party, which has sought fresher faces and more transformative ideas, and has challenged the idea that he\u2019s the most electable candidate in the field.</p> <p>He and his supporters have cast him as the most viable choice to defeat Donald Trump in 2020. But months into his campaign, with opponents making moves in the polls, should Biden really be as comfortable as he seems?</p> <p>Jeanne Trachta, who came to the fair from Council Bluffs on the far west side of the state, is a farmer who has been hurting from Trump\u2019s trade war. She\u2019s \u201changing in there\u201d, she said, but is looking for relief \u2013 not just from the Trump\u2019s trade policies, but from a presidency she says has been toxic for the country.</p> <p>Ousting Trump is her main priority in 2020, and she will back the Democrat most capable of beating him.</p> <p>Is that Biden?</p> <p>\u201cHe came across pretty darn good today,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Trachta had initially backed Biden in the 2008 race, but she hasn\u2019t made up her mind yet this time around. She liked Eric Swalwell, who in the first debate called on Biden to \u201cpass the torch\u201d to a new generation of Democrats, but he dropped out of the race early last month. She has some concerns still about the 76-year-old Biden, including his age.

      "bodyText": "Joe Biden hardly seemed to be sweating. He was standing on a small wooden stage at the Iowa state fair, a large crowd around him, no shade in sight. He wore a dark polo and his signature aviator sunglasses, and spoke with a vigor that was absent in his first two Democratic debate performances. But while his audience perspired in the oppressive August sun, cooling themselves with paper fans, Biden seemed at ease. \u201cWe really are in a fight to restore the soul of this country,\u201d he said, to applause. \u201cIt\u2019s time to remember who in God\u2019s name we are.\u201d Biden, the current Democratic frontrunner for president, can be a gaffe-machine on the campaign trail. But at events like this, where his \u201cUncle Joe\u201d folksiness fits right in, Biden seemed in his element \u2013 which is ironic, considering it was here, at the Iowa state fair in Des Moines, where his first campaign for president fell apart more than three decades ago. Speaking at the fair in 1987, Biden was found to have plagiarized a huge chunk of his closing remarks from a speech by the British Labour leader, Neil Kinnock. The scandal killed his campaign; he dropped his bid for the 1988 Democratic nod a month after it broke. But this time around Biden has appeared more robust \u2013 even as the blunders have kept coming. He has endured two rounds or mostly poorly reviewed debate performances, rode out a scandal over inappropriate touching of women, flip-flopped on abortion policy and committed numerous faux pas. Last week alone he got the place names of two mass shootings wrong and then inadvertently told a mostly minority crowd at an Iowa event: \u201cPoor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids.\u201d Yet, entering the race as the presumptive frontrunner, Biden has comfortably led the field since \u2013 and even some of those who don\u2019t support him view him as the inevitable nominee. \u201cI think he is the de facto strongest candidate,\u201d said Alan Collinge, a Washington state native who attended Biden\u2019s soapbox address but doesn\u2019t see the former vice-president as his preferred choice. Biden enjoys broad name recognition, access to a major donor network, and is beloved by the Democratic establishment. But that establishment increasingly seems to have fallen out of favor with the younger, more progressive wing of the party, which has sought fresher faces and more transformative ideas, and has challenged the idea that he\u2019s the most electable candidate in the field. He and his supporters have cast him as the most viable choice to defeat Donald Trump in 2020. But months into his campaign, with opponents making moves in the polls, should Biden really be as comfortable as he seems? Jeanne Trachta, who came to the fair from Council Bluffs on the far west side of the state, is a farmer who has been hurting from Trump\u2019s trade war. She\u2019s \u201changing in there\u201d, she said, but is looking for relief \u2013 not just from the Trump\u2019s trade policies, but from a presidency she says has been toxic for the country. Ousting Trump is her main priority in 2020, and she will back the Democrat most capable of beating him. Is that Biden? \u201cHe came across pretty darn good today,\u201d she said. Trachta had initially backed Biden in the 2008 race, but she hasn\u2019t made up her mind yet this time around. She liked Eric Swalwell, who in the first debate called on Biden to \u201cpass the torch\u201d to a new generation of Democrats, but he dropped out of the race early last month. She has some concerns still about the 76-year-old Biden, including his age. But, she said, he might be the best chance Democrats have to get rid of Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s good,\u201d she said of Biden. \u201cHe\u2019s experienced.\u201d Arla Darling agrees. She had been a registered Republican, but quit the party over Trump. Not far from the soapbox, a local radio station had set up a tent in which passersby could cast a corn kernel for the presidential candidate of their choice. Darling dropped a kernel in the Mason jar with Biden\u2019s face on it. By 2pm, when Biden finished his speech, he was leading Democrats in the Cast Your Kernel poll with 34%; Elizabeth Warren was his next closest competitor, at 13%. \u201cI\u2019d like to see somebody give [Trump] a good run,\u201d she said. But others in attendance raised concerns about his candidacy. Collinge, who stopped by the fair to see the candidates during a cross-country road trip, held a Biden campaign sign as he left the speech, but doesn\u2019t consider himself a supporter. He\u2019s looking for a candidate who will address the student debt crisis, and hasn\u2019t quite found one yet. He says progressives Warren and Bernie Sanders have put forth the \u201cmost attractive\u201d plans to fix the issue \u2013 they have called for student debt to be canceled \u2013 but he\u2019s not sure those ideas stand a chance on Capitol Hill. Biden, Collinge said, is \u201cactually one of the bad guys on this issue\u201d, owing to his previous backing of bills that made it more challenging to reduce student debt. That and other aspects of Biden\u2019s history make Collinge wary of him. And while he still feels Biden will probably get the nomination, Collinge believes he\u2019s coasting on the \u201cpast glory\u201d of the Obama administration. Indeed, a strong sense of nostalgia animates Biden\u2019s latest presidential campaign, and he often gives off the impression that everything in the country had been running smoothly until Trump came around. Many progressives, though, see Trump not as an aberration, but a symptom of deeper problems that have existed in the country since long before he defeated Hillary Clinton. Edward Rosson came from Kansas to see the candidates at the fair; nearly the entire field of Democrats, as well as the Republican Bill Weld, who is aiming to give Trump a primary challenge, converged on the fairgrounds to get their 20 minutes on the soapbox. Rosson likes Biden and got a book signed by him, but would need to see drastic changes in his platform to support him over Sanders or Warren, who have impressed with their consistency and detailed policy proposals. \u201cI thought he was good,\u201d Rosson said of Biden\u2019s soapbox speech. \u201cBut he didn\u2019t address any of the underlying issues.\u201d Democratic strategist Kelly Dietrich agrees that Biden has yet to \u201ctie his built-up good will and credibility from the past to a vision of the future that is aggressive and progressive\u201d to unify the party behind him. Still, Dietrich suggested Biden may be right to feel comfortable. \u201cWe can pull apart and nitpick every detail of debate performances, but the reality is the vice-president starts with inherent advantages that the other candidates simply don\u2019t have,\u201d Dietrich said. \u201cJoe Biden\u2019s challenge is to pair what people know about him already with an empowering, inspiring and aggressive vision for the future.\u201d \u201cThat is what I don\u2019t think we have heard from him yet.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/higher-education\">universities</a> are bracing themselves for a last-minute battle for new recruits in what is expected to be the most competitive A-level student recruitment round to date.</p> <p>Hundreds of thousands of 18-year-olds will pick up their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/alevels\">A-level results</a> next Thursday. For those intending to go to university it will be a buyers\u2019 market, with many of the country\u2019s leading institutions vying to attract students to take up places on tens of thousands of courses that are still unfilled.</p> <p>Competition for students is intense after the lifting of the cap on student numbers and because of a dip in the number of 18-year-olds in the population. There are additional concerns this year that the number of EU students will fall because of Brexit uncertainty.</p> <p>According to the university admissions service, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/applying-to-university\">U</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/applying-to-university\">cas</a>, places were still available on more than 30,000 courses in 350 providers across the UK this week. More are likely to become available through the clearing process once results are released and universities have a clearer idea of numbers.</p> <p>Many of the most popular and sought-after institutions in the UK have already posted vacancies. On the Ucas clearing site on Thursday, Bristol University listed more than 130 courses with places still available, Exeter had 270 and Leeds 260.</p> <p>Among the subjects still up for grabs were law, medicine and English. After years of solid growth, there has also been a significant drop in the number of applications to study maths this year, which means places are still available.</p> <p>Parents in England are being urged to take time off work next week for results day, when a record number of students are expected to search for a university place through clearing.</p> <p>Richard O\u2019Kelly, the head of data and analysis at Ucas, said: \u201cClearing acceptances have been on the rise for several years. There\u2019s been a 50% increase in the last decade \u2013 from 43,890 in 2008, to 66,770 in 2018. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to see more than 70,000 students get their place through clearing this year, 80,000 even.</p> <p>\u201cUniversity admissions is a competitive market, especially with the continual decline over the past few years of the UK\u2019s 18-year-old population, and this is undoubtedly true for clearing too. Displays at train stations, pre-trailer cinema adverts, plus constant boomerangs, gifs and stories across social media right now are testament to that.\u201d</p> <p>While clearing is an effective way of matching students who may have just missed their required grades to vacancies elsewhere, it can result in students having to rethink their plans, studying at an alternative university in a different location and possibly a different subject.</p> <p>Julie Kelly, the head of the student centre at Hertfordshire University, said: \u201cIf your son or daughter ends up in clearing<em> </em>they are going to need your support. I would recommend booking the day off work, either to be on hand for support or to celebrate their results.</p> <p>\u201cLuckily most universities have some form of virtual open day, which helps students who can\u2019t visit in person; these are a great resource to review a couple of days before the results come. Ask your child to ensure they have a list of the universities they are looking to approach, the courses they want to study and the universities\u2019 clearing hotline numbers.\u201d</p> <p>Despite a 1.9% fall in the overall 18-year-old population in the UK, Ucas said a record number of young people applied for university this year, up 1% on 2018. Applications from EU students also held up, but admissions teams fear many of those applications will not result in students taking up places to study from September because of the uncertainty over Brexit and continuing access to student loans.</p> <p>Mike Nicholson, the director of undergraduate admissions and outreach at the University of Bath, warned: \u201cThis year and next year are going to be very tough for higher education. Next year we will know whether we are in or out of Europe.

      "bodyText": "UK universities are bracing themselves for a last-minute battle for new recruits in what is expected to be the most competitive A-level student recruitment round to date. Hundreds of thousands of 18-year-olds will pick up their A-level results next Thursday. For those intending to go to university it will be a buyers\u2019 market, with many of the country\u2019s leading institutions vying to attract students to take up places on tens of thousands of courses that are still unfilled. Competition for students is intense after the lifting of the cap on student numbers and because of a dip in the number of 18-year-olds in the population. There are additional concerns this year that the number of EU students will fall because of Brexit uncertainty. According to the university admissions service, Ucas, places were still available on more than 30,000 courses in 350 providers across the UK this week. More are likely to become available through the clearing process once results are released and universities have a clearer idea of numbers. Many of the most popular and sought-after institutions in the UK have already posted vacancies. On the Ucas clearing site on Thursday, Bristol University listed more than 130 courses with places still available, Exeter had 270 and Leeds 260. Among the subjects still up for grabs were law, medicine and English. After years of solid growth, there has also been a significant drop in the number of applications to study maths this year, which means places are still available. Parents in England are being urged to take time off work next week for results day, when a record number of students are expected to search for a university place through clearing. Richard O\u2019Kelly, the head of data and analysis at Ucas, said: \u201cClearing acceptances have been on the rise for several years. There\u2019s been a 50% increase in the last decade \u2013 from 43,890 in 2008, to 66,770 in 2018. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to see more than 70,000 students get their place through clearing this year, 80,000 even. \u201cUniversity admissions is a competitive market, especially with the continual decline over the past few years of the UK\u2019s 18-year-old population, and this is undoubtedly true for clearing too. Displays at train stations, pre-trailer cinema adverts, plus constant boomerangs, gifs and stories across social media right now are testament to that.\u201d While clearing is an effective way of matching students who may have just missed their required grades to vacancies elsewhere, it can result in students having to rethink their plans, studying at an alternative university in a different location and possibly a different subject. Julie Kelly, the head of the student centre at Hertfordshire University, said: \u201cIf your son or daughter ends up in clearing they are going to need your support. I would recommend booking the day off work, either to be on hand for support or to celebrate their results. \u201cLuckily most universities have some form of virtual open day, which helps students who can\u2019t visit in person; these are a great resource to review a couple of days before the results come. Ask your child to ensure they have a list of the universities they are looking to approach, the courses they want to study and the universities\u2019 clearing hotline numbers.\u201d Despite a 1.9% fall in the overall 18-year-old population in the UK, Ucas said a record number of young people applied for university this year, up 1% on 2018. Applications from EU students also held up, but admissions teams fear many of those applications will not result in students taking up places to study from September because of the uncertainty over Brexit and continuing access to student loans. Mike Nicholson, the director of undergraduate admissions and outreach at the University of Bath, warned: \u201cThis year and next year are going to be very tough for higher education. Next year we will know whether we are in or out of Europe. If we are out, that will take a whole lot of students out of the system.\u201d Universities who have undergone massive expansion in recent years, with expensive building programmes, will be hit hardest by contracting student numbers. Students who might once have gone to a mid- or lower-tariff institution will be able to trade up with places still available at many Russell Group universities. As a result, some universities face severe financial difficulties. After the uncertainty of previous years with the rollout of new qualifications intended to add rigour to the exams system and bring it up to date, the A-level reforms are this year largely complete and results are expected to be stable. Philip Nye, the external affairs manager at FFT Education Datalab, said one of the most significant changes appeared to be a drop in the number of entries for A-level maths, from about 91,000 in 2018 to 86,000 this year. Further maths was also down. \u201cThis is the first cohort who will have taken the new GCSE in 2017.

It\u2019s an official program for the state memorial service held for Nelson Mandela in Johannesburg back in 2013. Sharpton, the American civil rights stalwart, had been unable to travel to the event in person, and received a copy in the mail signed by a close friend. Across the program\u2019s gold lettering, a short message is scrawled in thin black marker: \u201cTo Rev Sharpton \u2013 A fellow warrior for justice!\u201d The signature is Barack Obama\u2019s, who back on that wet December day gave a speech in honor of Mandela that framed his legacy and post-apartheid reconciliation as a clarion call for global justice and peace.

      "body": "<p><strong>Name:</strong> Larch Maxey <strong>Age:</strong> 46 <strong>Income:</strong> \u00a30 <strong>Occupation:</strong> Full-time volunteer with Extinction Rebellion</p> <p>I\u2019m on a year\u2019s sabbatical, and volunteering full-time with Extinction Rebellion. I\u2019ve always been interested the environment and social justice \u2013 I have a PhD in sustainability and was a geography lecturer and post-doctoral researcher for 17 years \u2013 and I\u2019ve been a climate-change activist for 25 years. During 1994-5 I lived up a tree for a year as part of the No M65 campaign in Lancashire, which I co-founded. For me that was all about the climate and ecological emergency; I\u2019ve waited 25 years for a movement like <a href=\"https://rebellion.earth/\" title=\"\">Extinction Rebellion</a> (XR) that uses the science of social change so effectively.</p> <p>I met XR at Offgrid Festival last August, and was won over by their focus on system change. The next week I brought XR to the Sunrise festival. Suddenly I was helping out on evenings and weekends, fitting in volunteering around my two jobs as co-founder of a wellbeing charity and co-director of Bright Green Futures, a social enterprise creating eco self-build communities.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The turning point came when I was arrested for obstruction on Soutwark bridge and spent nine hours in a police cell</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I took two weeks\u2019 annual leave to volunteer full time with XR in November, but the turning point came when I was unexpectedly arrested for obstruction of the highway on Southwark bridge on 17 November and spent nine hours in a police cell.</p> <p>It gave me the chance to really reflect on my life and priorities. I saw what\u2019s important to me and felt deep regret at not having spent the last 25 years addressing climate chaos full time. I know I was doing the best I could, and I had two kids to prioritise. Now they\u2019re adults and this incredibly effective vehicle that is XR has come along, it became clear to me that I needed to go on sabbatical. I knew now was the time to make a difference before the threat to our existence deepens and leads to societal collapse. We only have this year to start bringing emissions down. But it really is possible if enough people join us.</p> <p>I work about 14 hours, six days a week with Extinction Rebellion. My role involves helping develop and implement our strategy and ideas for actions, and linking up with international groups. This is my life\u2019s purpose, and I couldn\u2019t be happier and more fulfilled. I\u2019m happy to spend every waking moment bringing this change about.</p> <p>I\u2019m currently living off my savings. I have just applied for living expenses through XR and requested \u00a3600 a month. No one gets a salary with XR. We don\u2019t ask for the amount we\u2019d like, but how much we need. I have savings as I\u2019ve always saved since I was a child, even if there was nothing particular to save for. A dilemma for me has been digging into savings I\u2019d hoped to give my children, aged 20 and 18, money towards a deposit for a home. But if we don\u2019t turn this emergency around, there won\u2019t be a future.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f5f74cfcd50b21dd45738127ade9aa2656985120\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5f74cfcd50b21dd45738127ade9aa2656985120/0_230_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An Extinction Rebellion protest this month in Birmingham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An Extinction Rebellion protest this month in Birmingham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jacob King/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I live for free with my best friend Toby in Brixton. As well as joining XR for our big rebellions and actions, he supports XR by giving me a free room.</p> <p>I\u2019m a relaxed freegan. I keep my eyes open and look for food at every opportunity that would otherwise go to waste. Sometimes that means eating leftover food from whoever I\u2019m hanging out with, or collecting food from a local cafe or market stall before they throw it out.</p> <p>I have a flat in Totnes, where I rent a couple of rooms. My mortgage is \u00a3850 a month and is mostly covered by two lodgers. Travel sets me back about \u00a3250 a month, with most of it spent on trains to and from Totnes. Travelling by tube is expensive so I cycle around London, which I love as I get exercise and explore the city.</p> <p>I do have a car that I was planning to let go of, but actually XR are going to use it for a tour of Europe, so I just spent \u00a325 to insure someone for it.</p> <p>I tend to find clothing. For example if there\u2019s a sock on the pavement, I\u2019ll pick it up and give it a rinse at home. I\u2019ve just sewn up a pair of trousers. I like to repair stuff.</p> <p>While lifestyle and voting can help, they\u2019re no longer enough. We\u2019re in an emergency and we need system change urgently. Far more important than how we vote or live is that we work together for system change and that requires mass peaceful civil disobedience. Join us.</p> <p>I plan to continue working as a full-time XR volunteer until the government adopts our three demands. We need citizens\u2019 assemblies, ordinary people deciding the policies to solve the crisis. If we don\u2019t sort it out, our children won\u2019t have a future.</p> <p><em>As told to Suzanne Bearne</em></p>",

I\u2019ve always been interested the environment and social justice \u2013 I have a PhD in sustainability and was a geography lecturer and post-doctoral researcher for 17 years \u2013 and I\u2019ve been a climate-change activist for 25 years. During 1994-5 I lived up a tree for a year as part of the No M65 campaign in Lancashire, which I co-founded. For me that was all about the climate and ecological emergency; I\u2019ve waited 25 years for a movement like Extinction Rebellion (XR) that uses the science of social change so effectively. I met XR at Offgrid Festival last August, and was won over by their focus on system change. The next week I brought XR to the Sunrise festival. Suddenly I was helping out on evenings and weekends, fitting in volunteering around my two jobs as co-founder of a wellbeing charity and co-director of Bright Green Futures, a social enterprise creating eco self-build communities. I took two weeks\u2019 annual leave to volunteer full time with XR in November, but the turning point came when I was unexpectedly arrested for obstruction of the highway on Southwark bridge on 17 November and spent nine hours in a police cell. It gave me the chance to really reflect on my life and priorities. I saw what\u2019s important to me and felt deep regret at not having spent the last 25 years addressing climate chaos full time. I know I was doing the best I could, and I had two kids to prioritise. Now they\u2019re adults and this incredibly effective vehicle that is XR has come along, it became clear to me that I needed to go on sabbatical. I knew now was the time to make a difference before the threat to our existence deepens and leads to societal collapse. We only have this year to start bringing emissions down. But it really is possible if enough people join us. I work about 14 hours, six days a week with Extinction Rebellion. My role involves helping develop and implement our strategy and ideas for actions, and linking up with international groups. This is my life\u2019s purpose, and I couldn\u2019t be happier and more fulfilled. I\u2019m happy to spend every waking moment bringing this change about. I\u2019m currently living off my savings. I have just applied for living expenses through XR and requested \u00a3600 a month. No one gets a salary with XR. We don\u2019t ask for the amount we\u2019d like, but how much we need. I have savings as I\u2019ve always saved since I was a child, even if there was nothing particular to save for. A dilemma for me has been digging into savings I\u2019d hoped to give my children, aged 20 and 18, money towards a deposit for a home. But if we don\u2019t turn this emergency around, there won\u2019t be a future. I live for free with my best friend Toby in Brixton. As well as joining XR for our big rebellions and actions, he supports XR by giving me a free room. I\u2019m a relaxed freegan. I keep my eyes open and look for food at every opportunity that would otherwise go to waste. Sometimes that means eating leftover food from whoever I\u2019m hanging out with, or collecting food from a local cafe or market stall before they throw it out. I have a flat in Totnes, where I rent a couple of rooms. My mortgage is \u00a3850 a month and is mostly covered by two lodgers. Travel sets me back about \u00a3250 a month, with most of it spent on trains to and from Totnes. Travelling by tube is expensive so I cycle around London, which I love as I get exercise and explore the city. I do have a car that I was planning to let go of, but actually XR are going to use it for a tour of Europe, so I just spent \u00a325 to insure someone for it. I tend to find clothing. For example if there\u2019s a sock on the pavement, I\u2019ll pick it up and give it a rinse at home. I\u2019ve just sewn up a pair of trousers. I like to repair stuff. While lifestyle and voting can help, they\u2019re no longer enough. We\u2019re in an emergency and we need system change urgently. Far more important than how we vote or live is that we work together for system change and that requires mass peaceful civil disobedience. Join us. I plan to continue working as a full-time XR volunteer until the government adopts our three demands. We need citizens\u2019 assemblies, ordinary people deciding the policies to solve the crisis. If we don\u2019t sort it out, our children won\u2019t have a future. As told to Suzanne Bearne",

The Eurasian beaver, a vital habitat engineer, has lost more than half its previous range,although it is being reintroduced into the UK, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland and elsewhere. The anticipated escalation of dangers facing mega\u2010fish in basins such as the Amazon, Congo and Mekong due to the boom in hydropower dam construction is very worrying, said the researchers. Large animals usually need large ranges and dams block migration routes and access to feeding grounds. Two-thirds of the world\u2019s great rivers no longer run freely. Freshwater animals are declining much faster than land animals and the loss of river and lake megafauna also endangers smaller creatures and plants. Disruption of delicate food chains causes damage, as does the loss of pools maintained by beavers and crocodiles. \u201cBiodiversity loss is one of the biggest challenges facing our planet, leading to the erosion of ecosystem services [such as food and clean water] and threatening human wellbeing,\u201d the researchers warned. Some scientists think the Earth is at the start of a sixth mass extinction of life, the first caused by a species \u2013 humans \u2013 rather than physical changes to the planet. In May, a landmark report warned the annihilation of wildlife was eroding the foundations of economies, livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life worldwide. However the new study cites some successes as the result of persistent conservation efforts, including population increases in two species of sturgeon in the US, the American beaver and the Asian Irrawaddy river dolphin \u2013 though the latter is still classified as vulnerable.",

      "body": "<p>Distraught relatives wept alongside distressed children in school lobbies this week, trying to grapple with the reality that agents from the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency had taken their parents away.</p> <p>Agents stormed the workplaces and loaded up about 680 employees whom they claimed were undocumented immigrants. The agents arrested and tased at least one US citizen.</p> <p>The ICE raids, carried out under the leadership of a Donald Trump-appointed US attorney, took place at seven food processing plants in six Mississippi cities.

      "bodyText": "Distraught relatives wept alongside distressed children in school lobbies this week, trying to grapple with the reality that agents from the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency had taken their parents away. Agents stormed the workplaces and loaded up about 680 employees whom they claimed were undocumented immigrants. The agents arrested and tased at least one US citizen. The ICE raids, carried out under the leadership of a Donald Trump-appointed US attorney, took place at seven food processing plants in six Mississippi cities. Photographs of crying children left distraught when their parents were taken into custody immediately went viral worldwide. Father Jeremy Tobin, a Catholic priest who works with the Mississippi Immigrants Rights Alliance (Mira), told the Guardian he had been flooded with worried calls and messages from immigrants, documented and undocumented alike.

The impulse, like the water, must be wild and free\u2019</strong></h2> <p><strong>Rachel Edwards, Oxfordshire</strong></p> <p>I love our river. It is ours not because we live on it (we don\u2019t), or because we covet ownership of a beauty spot, but because this water flows through our family life. Our stretch of river lies between London and Oxford; it is technically the Thames and not quite the Isis; it is a gentle roar, a rushing calm, a city-country icon that feels deeply personal.</p> <p>When I first moved to our south Oxfordshire hamlet, 16 years ago, the river\u2019s appeal was clear: every yard of it is picture perfect. Cross the weir, past the mill house and over the lock, past the weeping willow. Walk on with fields to your right and the river to your left, fringed by greenery that is mature yet exuberant (like many of the locals) and tiny beaches where anglers sit, nodding away the dogs who come sniffing at their bait.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3666b32f0963d5cd953592f8c0a6e9ccd5294d9e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3666b32f0963d5cd953592f8c0a6e9ccd5294d9e/0_224_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rachel Edwards in the river\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018My love of the water is simply this: it is boundless and immersive.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominick Tyler/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From the first, I planned to walk lazy lengths of it, listen to it, lie by it, watch it and without a doubt dip in it. Yet, I am not the strongest swimmer \u2013 not the bravest, or most adventurous, or the most lithe. My relationship with our river would not prove a questionable midlife athleticism by the covering of great distances. My love of this water is simply this: it is boundless and immersive. One tentative dip off the side of a friend\u2019s boat, when the temperature and I were both in our 20s, told me it was the real thing.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I emerge each time alive but more so, skin teased and tingling</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I go in the water whenever the mood takes me: I have dunked myself to chill out a fraught afternoon and to commune with the dawn. I have been in with boat-weary friends, my husband, and \u2013 ill-advised, of course \u2013 alone (usually an angler is within shouting distance). To have a regular routine would kill the magic for me. The impulse, like the water, must be wild and free. When I do go in, it is always in summer \u2013 I marvel at those with hardy, moon-white bodies who smear themselves in goose fat and launch into wintry seas. I will never be one of their number. Even in a heatwave I mince in, arms bent and aloft, waiting for the cold water to stun my broiling core. Waist depth is optimum; I feel freed but embraced; I think about dipping my head under for a while. No earrings, no watch, offline. I\u2019m ready.</p> <p>I emerge each time alive but more so, skin teased and tingling, braids dripping, my mind washed of dark clutter; I am, if not quite reborn, then absolved by unseen river gods for as long as the water drips down my calves. Our river restores, rewarding even the most timid dip with cool inspiration.

But on rare days, the sea is calm and the air is warm and it was then, when I was a kid, that we swam.</p> <p>The pools form where slabs of flagstone meet; as the tide recedes, a network of \u201ccold tubs\u201d emerges. Pictures of me and my brother there as children look like they were taken on a Greek island. But photographs cannot show the temperature \u2013 the water is aways cold enough to make you shriek.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I can hear the ocean crashing on the beach around the corner</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the summer holidays, friends would appear at the farm to go swimming. It\u2019s a 10-minute walk from there to the pools, across the sheep field, over a stone stile, then a clamber down a bank to the slabs, which all slope towards the sea.</p> <p>Thirty years later, I\u2019ve returned to take the same walk. Some more of the cliff has crumbled, but it\u2019s mainly unchanged. Oystercatchers are piping above. Out to sea, there\u2019s a creel boat. The odd gannet dives, and seals pop up. Below the high-water mark, in the inter-tidal zone, the rocks are covered in barnacles, mussels, anemones. The pools swell with thong weed, sea lettuce, bladderwrack and more.</p> <p>These pools are for summer only. The sun has warmed the water slightly, so the temperature is \u201ccold\u201d rather than \u201cextremely cold\u201d. Wearing neoprene boots and a swimsuit, I slide in among the seaweed, which is silky on my skin. Someone once told me that submerging the heart is the hardest part. Then I\u2019m in my element, up to my neck, swimming. Even on this calm day, I can hear the ocean crashing on the beach around the corner. Thong weed winds itself around my wrists and ankles, and I feel like some kind of hybrid sea beastie.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"894c16067311db6534f807bdc7fab58f03dc054c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/894c16067311db6534f807bdc7fab58f03dc054c/0_349_3456_4259/811.jpg\" alt=\"Amy Liptrot swims in pools at Upper Garson\" width=\"811\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The pleasure of getting cold and, crucially, warm again is beloved by the Scandinavians, with their saunas and icy plunges. It was also, I\u2019ve discovered, known by the ancient Orkney islanders. A recent archaeological dig on the island of Westray uncovered bronze age buildings, including one with a water tank that they believe was used as a sweat house or sauna. The structure was near the sea so a steam could be followed by a swim.</p> <p>Just a few minutes of head-up breaststroke is enough before my body tells me I have to get out. I exit the pool as I often do, using my hands as well as feet, to balance on the wet rocks and avoid slipping on the seaweed. I notice that my knee is bleeding \u2013 probably a barnacle scrape \u2013 and instinctively lean down and lick it. Half naked coming out of the ocean, on all fours, tasting my own blood, an Arctic tern screeching and diving above, I am alive and wild.</p> <p>Later, warming up with a cup of tea and salty skin, sucking the Atlantic out of my hair, I have a rush of wellbeing. The cold is addictive. It\u2019s obliterating. It\u2019s renewing. Each swim is like a near-death experience, and each time the swimmer survives, they are overjoyed and stronger.</p> <p>\u2022 Amy Liptrot\u2019s memoir <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/outrun-607996.html\" title=\"\">The Outrun</a> (Canongate) is out now</p> <h2><strong>\u2018In the Dart the water is peaty; like downing a shot of neat water whisky\u2019</strong></h2> <p><strong>Elizabeth-Jane Burnett, Devon</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"16ede86c15b4212ea97f56ba5576f3e6a0105031\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/16ede86c15b4212ea97f56ba5576f3e6a0105031/0_65_19133_11486/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elizabeth-Jane Burnett (who usually swims in the Dart) takes a dip in the Ouse, East Sussex.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elizabeth-Jane Burnett (who usually swims in the Dart) takes a dip in the Ouse, East Sussex.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Burnett</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Treading the bones of ash, roots as steps, I enter the water. Moss-lined bark strokes the balls of my feet as I change lanes from human to river. It is the water\u2019s course I follow now; its currents, eddies and points of stagnation. I have not given myself over completely; I still have a navigator\u2019s awareness \u2013 when to steer, to kick, float, or resist. It is a kind of dance.</p> <p>I have been dancing the River Dart in Devon since childhood. At first, the dances were dips, cooling off with friends on a summer\u2019s day. Later, they became swims, often solitary, as I came to know stretches of the river more intimately, at different times of the year.</p> <p>As a writer, the names of places pulled me in as much as the water: Black Rock, Sharrah Pool and Bow Creek. Sharpham Point soon became a favourite on account of its easy access, the richness of its bird and aquatic life, and the tint and taste of its water. Here I have swum with kingfishers; their turquoise flashes interrupting the muted landscape with violent sneezes, orange breasts rising like airborne salmon. I greet the swallows, swimming under their flight path, tracing milk bellies, blushed throats. As their tail feathers fan out, so do my arms.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Rivers, and discrete parts of the same river, have different tastes</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>These moments of encounter with other species are a large part of swimming\u2019s appeal for me. I am fascinated with whom I\u2019m sharing the water: from the flashy birds overhead to the microscopic organisms beneath. When the water lifts into bubbles I need to know who\u2019s making them, dipping under to see. There is a sense of unity with my water companions \u2013 all of us brimming and skimming and pulling together through the murky underworld of unseen things.</p> <p>Rivers, and discrete parts of the same river, have different tastes. I love the flavour of the Dart in places like Sharpham Point, where water can be as dark and deep as peat; like downing a shot of neat water whisky.</p> <p>Writing and swimming are complementary practices; they encourage us to conceive of ourselves differently. Both processes question our habitual ways of moving through the world. Sometimes, I take words into the water. I run Swillowing workshops, where swimmers are given a Wind In The Willows persona to embody as they enter the water, afterwards recording their experiences as rats, moles and moorhens.</p> <p>The space of the river doesn\u2019t always offer a rural idyll. Even remote locations can bear the marks of human-influenced damage, as pesticides spill off fields into water and, potentially, a swimmer\u2019s body. Just as the fish, and other lives in the water, may carry these pollutants, so may the swimmer. We are in a community with the other species who are similarly entangled in both the problems and the pleasures of our land and waterscapes.</p> <p>Swimming offers an invitation to kinship with many organisms in and of the water, which I take up whenever I can. In the Dart, furred limbs of ash brush below, as swallows blush above. Always, it is a kind of dance.</p> <p>\u2022 Elizabeth-Jane Burnett is the author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/grassling-9780241374122.html\" title=\"\">The Grassling (Allen Lane)</a></p> <h2><strong>\u2018The lido represents convivial, multicultural London at its best\u2019</strong></h2> <p><strong>Joh</strong><strong>ny Pitts, Brockwell lido</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b0f4d96715b038574143b9895d14629334649ce0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0f4d96715b038574143b9895d14629334649ce0/0_1143_4480_5577/803.jpg\" alt=\"Johny Pitts at Brockwell lido in London.\" width=\"803\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Johny Pitts at Brockwell lido in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominick Tyler/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I once heard someone describe their depression in the following terms: \u201cEven if the sun is out and the sky is blue, you feel awful. As though the jolly weather is mocking the storm you\u2019re carrying inside.\u201d It made me think of London in the summer: overpacked festivals, sociopathic cyclists, expensive beer and gentrified car parks selling \u201cstreet food\u201d at exorbitant prices to trust-funded art students. I watch all this from a distance, too knackered to join in even when I can afford to, seeing the culture that sustained me growing up working-class in Britain \u2013 brutalist architecture, street markets and secondhand shops \u2013 culturally reappropriated in a way that precludes my involvement.</p> <p>I cheer myself up by reimagining this tough, corporate-in-disguise metropolis as my own personal bohemia, and my search for simple pleasures often leads me to Herne Hill. On the way I cycle past streets named after Langston Hughes, Derek Walcott and Alice Walker. I\u2019ll buy a patty for \u00a31.50 at Mina\u2019s Caribbean takeaway, and wander Brockwell Park, surely one of the prettiest in London, without the pomp of Regent\u2019s Park or the anxious trendiness of London Fields. Like the latter, Brockwell also has its own streamline moderne lido, making it look like the backdrop for an episode of Poirot, though the only death here is of one\u2019s own stress.</p> <p>During the summer months the lido is quieter in the evening and just the right temperature, cool enough to be bracing, warm enough after a few strokes to encourage you to carry on. Fifteen minutes or so into my swim my goggles begin to steam up, but I don\u2019t wipe them, preferring to let myself exist for the best part of an hour in a world shrouded in mist.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Once I'm in the zone, I don't hear anything but the reassuring thud of my own pumping circulation</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Once I\u2019m in the zone, I don\u2019t hear anything but the reassuring thud of my own pumping circulation and a consoling subaqueous muffle. I used to count lengths, but now I just swim at roughly 75% exertion for 45 minutes to allow my mind to drift off. I problem solve and write as I swim \u2013 I composed some of this essay beneath the water; somehow the work that takes place there is devoid of anxiety. A later analysis may disprove my theory, but I only have \u201cgood\u201d ideas when I\u2019m submerged, feeling free and creative. I marvel at my human capability as I ply through dead insects in the water \u2013 even though it may seem a humble skill (and I swim badly), I can\u2019t believe that my body is making all the minute adjustments it needs to keep itself fluent in the language of the aquatic, while my mind is firmly elsewhere.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t always this way. My mother nearly drowned when she was a child, and never learned to swim, instilling the same mistrust of bodies of water into my own childhood. I first acquired breaststroke in my early 20s, in extraordinary circumstances; taught in the creek of a rainforest in eastern Australia by Clionna, a swimming instructor from Ireland I\u2019d befriended while backpacking.</p> <p>Perhaps that\u2019s why outdoor swimming strikes me as so liberating \u2013 it\u2019s where I found my flow. I grew up in a multicultural, working-class urban area, and despite being only a 25-minute drive from the glorious Derwent Valley in the Peak District, as a black kid I felt culturally and spiritually disconnected from the natural amenities of swimming, camping and climbing on my doorstep. It was the 90s, and in the wake of Thatcherism, civic spaces had fallen out of favour \u2013 my memories are of dried up drinking fountains and derelict paddling pools.</p> <p>In the early 90s, Brockwell lido suffered a similar fate, falling into a state of disrepair, and ultimately closing for more than a decade, before being reopened by a charity. This is why it\u2019s so nice to see such a mix of people enjoying the lido now; it\u2019s unlike so many spaces in the city \u2013 an inexpensive (free for residents on certain days) community space that\u2019s oversubscribed. Yes, it can get annoyingly crowded (as the police found out when it was stormed by 500 people trying to cool off in the recent heatwave), but mostly it represents convivial, multicultural London at its best, and I always emerge from the water feeling calm, centred, revitalised.

I learned to swim in an old stone pool in the grounds of my school, and from there migrated to a freezing lake, so cold it ran a cracking ring around your skull, which may be why this most easterly stretch of the North Sea feels familiarly embracing. For years \u2013 decades \u2013 I considered myself hardy, perplexing my duffel-coated friends as they hunkered on the beach in June, unswayed by my much repeated assertion that they\u2019d feel great, afterwards, if they joined me in the water. But four years ago, when I challenged myself to swim throughout the year, I realised I hardly knew this sea at all. It was forever changing once I arrived to greet it at the same time every morning. Wild and rough; rust brown and green; flat as a millpond; metal grey; mother of pearl; silver. It kept its warmth right through the autumn. December was manageable, but the chill, once it settled, lasted late into the spring. In March, a Siberian ice floe seized you by the ankles, and if you listened, urged you to get out. In May, it beat your heart, scalded your skin, left you glowing and refuelled. By summer the water ( I have been accused of exaggeration) is warm as a bath.</p> <p>This year I spent a week in Scotland, driving through the West Highlands, up over the north coast and down again along the east. When we arrived it was raining so hard I could hardly see the hire car, let alone the bay, but on the second day, when it was only drizzling, I ran down to the shore at Glenuig. The water was crystal clear, the sea bed thick with shells and minnows, jellyfish and clams. I had a great desire to strike out to Samalaman island opposite, not so very far, but I didn\u2019t know the sea here \u2013 its tides and currents \u2013 and alone in the water, I turned back. Travelling north, I swam off a coral beach \u2013 seaweed, tall as overshot allium, sprouting above the surface, mist keeping other visitors away; and as we rounded the tip of Britain, the evening sun came out over Durness and I swam out to a curve of boulders. I would have swum on, but there was nothing beyond but Iceland, over 1,000km away.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Four years ago, when I challenged myself to swim throughout the year, I realised I hardly knew this sea at all</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Driving south again I kept my eyes out for the perfect bay for my last swim, and it wasn\u2019t until we stopped on the edge of Loch Ness, to take a tour of Urquhart Castle, that I found a sheltered shingle beach. And to the surprise of the Philadelphian woman Instagramming her way around the ruins, I whipped off my clothes, pulled on my costume and struck out into the loch. It was clear and warm and fathoms deep, and my heart hammered with the knowledge there was more water here than in all the lakes of England and Wales combined. When I came out I was ecstatic. This swim would last me through the long train journey home.</p> <p>Back in Suffolk the sea was brown and green. All the same, I was pleased to see it; to know its dips and shallows, the strength of its current, at what moment, at its roughest, to throw yourself in. There were my friends, swimming converts themselves now, and our children, most of them grown, waiting at the agreed morning hour. The first swim was more of a wade, the tide was so far out. The next, later that day, close up against the shore. The third, the night after a storm, the sand treacly, the water refreshing as champagne. And the fourth had wild whipping waves, warm and jubilant. They swept us up, cascaded us down, chasing hard as we scrambled for the shore, so that, safely out, we stood in the sunshine, our towels flapping, remonstrating happily over whether or not that was the best swim yet.</p> <p>\u2022 Esther Freud is the author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/mr-mac-and-me-295817.html\" title=\"\">Mr Mac And Me (Bloomsbury)</a></p> <h2><strong>\u2018I cycle to the shore at dawn, and launch naked into the unknown\u2019</strong></h2> <p><strong>Philip Hoare, </strong><strong>south coast</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7cda97b728d3cd56a8560d0c3f733296d997bf81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7cda97b728d3cd56a8560d0c3f733296d997bf81/0_0_5792_8074/717.jpg\" alt=\"Philip Hoare heads for his swim at a \u2018secret location\u2019 on the south coast.\" width=\"717\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Philip Hoare heads for his swim at a \u2018secret location\u2019 on the south coast.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominick Tyler/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The sea is the only place I feel comfortable. Perhaps it\u2019s because I didn\u2019t learn to swim till I was in my early 30s. (My angel was an elderly lady in an East End of London public baths; she wore a rubber hat with daisies on it.) Now, every morning, I get out of bed and cycle to the shore \u2013 before dawn, often at 3am, in the dark, even in the winter. I know the place so well that I recognise individual stones on the beach. I launch, naked, into the unknown. Where else can you leave everything behind so effortlessly?</p> <p>Everyone is beautiful in the water. The sea is queer; the ultimate transformer. It starts with the animals and plants. They merge into one another, still evolving. Take the slipper shell. One of our most common shellfish \u2013 shaped as its name suggests, with a tactile little shelf in its white interior. When you find these little beauties on the shore, they\u2019re often attached, one to the other, sometimes seven in a row, in a little communal tower. In fact, as Philip Street revealed in his newly republished book from 1961, Shell Life On The Seashore, they\u2019re creatures caught in the moment of transition. The lowest shell is female, the topmost male \u2013 the others are gradually changing, little by little, from male to female.</p> <p>I\u2019m not going to tell you where my beach is. We regular swimmers prize our private places. Not that newcomers aren\u2019t welcome. According to a marine biologist friend, the south coast waters in which I swim are inhabited by the greatest number of \u201calien species\u201d in the UK.</p> <p>I recently spent the afternoon at a Cornish cove. I\u2019d been given directions by a local \u2013 through a hole in a hedge and down to a shingle shore. It was loved and cared for. Swimmers came and went, shifting their towels and cans of beer inland as the tide rolled in. As I swam out into the bay, I looked back and realised a spell had come over everyone. People had put down their phones, forsaking digital screens for the big blue screen in front of them. Dogs and children ran free. Time had stopped \u2013 but not the sea.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>\u2018I\u2019m not going to tell you exactly where my beach is.

I remembered how, as a boy, the beach was the world for me \u2013 its terror, and its infinity. Now its darkness is my resort, the safest place I know.</p> <p>The sea and the shore mean many things \u2013 heartbreak and hope, mortality and beauty, transience and persistence. Its withdrawal is a little death; its return, absolute life. We all came to being in the amniotic sea of our mothers\u2019 bellies. We measure our passing summers by the sea, and invest its vastness with our yearning. I\u2019m not sure our souls would exist without it. Jung called it the symbol of our collective unconscious, but I\u2019m not sure you can apply any words to it.

      "bodyText": "\u2018A routine would kill the magic. The impulse, like the water, must be wild and free\u2019 Rachel Edwards, Oxfordshire I love our river. It is ours not because we live on it (we don\u2019t), or because we covet ownership of a beauty spot, but because this water flows through our family life. Our stretch of river lies between London and Oxford; it is technically the Thames and not quite the Isis; it is a gentle roar, a rushing calm, a city-country icon that feels deeply personal. When I first moved to our south Oxfordshire hamlet, 16 years ago, the river\u2019s appeal was clear: every yard of it is picture perfect. Cross the weir, past the mill house and over the lock, past the weeping willow. Walk on with fields to your right and the river to your left, fringed by greenery that is mature yet exuberant (like many of the locals) and tiny beaches where anglers sit, nodding away the dogs who come sniffing at their bait. From the first, I planned to walk lazy lengths of it, listen to it, lie by it, watch it and without a doubt dip in it. Yet, I am not the strongest swimmer \u2013 not the bravest, or most adventurous, or the most lithe. My relationship with our river would not prove a questionable midlife athleticism by the covering of great distances. My love of this water is simply this: it is boundless and immersive. One tentative dip off the side of a friend\u2019s boat, when the temperature and I were both in our 20s, told me it was the real thing. I go in the water whenever the mood takes me: I have dunked myself to chill out a fraught afternoon and to commune with the dawn. I have been in with boat-weary friends, my husband, and \u2013 ill-advised, of course \u2013 alone (usually an angler is within shouting distance). To have a regular routine would kill the magic for me. The impulse, like the water, must be wild and free. When I do go in, it is always in summer \u2013 I marvel at those with hardy, moon-white bodies who smear themselves in goose fat and launch into wintry seas. I will never be one of their number. Even in a heatwave I mince in, arms bent and aloft, waiting for the cold water to stun my broiling core. Waist depth is optimum; I feel freed but embraced; I think about dipping my head under for a while. No earrings, no watch, offline. I\u2019m ready. I emerge each time alive but more so, skin teased and tingling, braids dripping, my mind washed of dark clutter; I am, if not quite reborn, then absolved by unseen river gods for as long as the water drips down my calves. Our river restores, rewarding even the most timid dip with cool inspiration. And so, in I go. \u2022 Rachel Edwards is the author of Darling (Fourth Estate) \u2018Seaweed winds itself around my wrists \u2013 I feel like a hybrid sea beastie\u2019 Amy Liptrot, Orkney Much of the time, it would be foolish to swim in the rockpools at the farm where I grew up, on the west coast of Orkney. The Atlantic swell creates huge breaking waves that slam this rocky shore, sending sea spray far inland. But on rare days, the sea is calm and the air is warm and it was then, when I was a kid, that we swam. The pools form where slabs of flagstone meet; as the tide recedes, a network of \u201ccold tubs\u201d emerges. Pictures of me and my brother there as children look like they were taken on a Greek island. But photographs cannot show the temperature \u2013 the water is aways cold enough to make you shriek. In the summer holidays, friends would appear at the farm to go swimming. It\u2019s a 10-minute walk from there to the pools, across the sheep field, over a stone stile, then a clamber down a bank to the slabs, which all slope towards the sea. Thirty years later, I\u2019ve returned to take the same walk. Some more of the cliff has crumbled, but it\u2019s mainly unchanged. Oystercatchers are piping above. Out to sea, there\u2019s a creel boat. The odd gannet dives, and seals pop up. Below the high-water mark, in the inter-tidal zone, the rocks are covered in barnacles, mussels, anemones. The pools swell with thong weed, sea lettuce, bladderwrack and more. These pools are for summer only. The sun has warmed the water slightly, so the temperature is \u201ccold\u201d rather than \u201cextremely cold\u201d. Wearing neoprene boots and a swimsuit, I slide in among the seaweed, which is silky on my skin. Someone once told me that submerging the heart is the hardest part. Then I\u2019m in my element, up to my neck, swimming. Even on this calm day, I can hear the ocean crashing on the beach around the corner. Thong weed winds itself around my wrists and ankles, and I feel like some kind of hybrid sea beastie. The pleasure of getting cold and, crucially, warm again is beloved by the Scandinavians, with their saunas and icy plunges. It was also, I\u2019ve discovered, known by the ancient Orkney islanders. A recent archaeological dig on the island of Westray uncovered bronze age buildings, including one with a water tank that they believe was used as a sweat house or sauna. The structure was near the sea so a steam could be followed by a swim. Just a few minutes of head-up breaststroke is enough before my body tells me I have to get out. I exit the pool as I often do, using my hands as well as feet, to balance on the wet rocks and avoid slipping on the seaweed. I notice that my knee is bleeding \u2013 probably a barnacle scrape \u2013 and instinctively lean down and lick it. Half naked coming out of the ocean, on all fours, tasting my own blood, an Arctic tern screeching and diving above, I am alive and wild. Later, warming up with a cup of tea and salty skin, sucking the Atlantic out of my hair, I have a rush of wellbeing. The cold is addictive. It\u2019s obliterating. It\u2019s renewing. Each swim is like a near-death experience, and each time the swimmer survives, they are overjoyed and stronger. \u2022 Amy Liptrot\u2019s memoir The Outrun (Canongate) is out now \u2018In the Dart the water is peaty; like downing a shot of neat water whisky\u2019 Elizabeth-Jane Burnett, Devon Treading the bones of ash, roots as steps, I enter the water. Moss-lined bark strokes the balls of my feet as I change lanes from human to river. It is the water\u2019s course I follow now; its currents, eddies and points of stagnation. I have not given myself over completely; I still have a navigator\u2019s awareness \u2013 when to steer, to kick, float, or resist. It is a kind of dance. I have been dancing the River Dart in Devon since childhood. At first, the dances were dips, cooling off with friends on a summer\u2019s day. Later, they became swims, often solitary, as I came to know stretches of the river more intimately, at different times of the year. As a writer, the names of places pulled me in as much as the water: Black Rock, Sharrah Pool and Bow Creek. Sharpham Point soon became a favourite on account of its easy access, the richness of its bird and aquatic life, and the tint and taste of its water. Here I have swum with kingfishers; their turquoise flashes interrupting the muted landscape with violent sneezes, orange breasts rising like airborne salmon. I greet the swallows, swimming under their flight path, tracing milk bellies, blushed throats. As their tail feathers fan out, so do my arms. These moments of encounter with other species are a large part of swimming\u2019s appeal for me. I am fascinated with whom I\u2019m sharing the water: from the flashy birds overhead to the microscopic organisms beneath. When the water lifts into bubbles I need to know who\u2019s making them, dipping under to see. There is a sense of unity with my water companions \u2013 all of us brimming and skimming and pulling together through the murky underworld of unseen things. Rivers, and discrete parts of the same river, have different tastes. I love the flavour of the Dart in places like Sharpham Point, where water can be as dark and deep as peat; like downing a shot of neat water whisky. Writing and swimming are complementary practices; they encourage us to conceive of ourselves differently. Both processes question our habitual ways of moving through the world. Sometimes, I take words into the water. I run Swillowing workshops, where swimmers are given a Wind In The Willows persona to embody as they enter the water, afterwards recording their experiences as rats, moles and moorhens. The space of the river doesn\u2019t always offer a rural idyll. Even remote locations can bear the marks of human-influenced damage, as pesticides spill off fields into water and, potentially, a swimmer\u2019s body. Just as the fish, and other lives in the water, may carry these pollutants, so may the swimmer. We are in a community with the other species who are similarly entangled in both the problems and the pleasures of our land and waterscapes. Swimming offers an invitation to kinship with many organisms in and of the water, which I take up whenever I can. In the Dart, furred limbs of ash brush below, as swallows blush above. Always, it is a kind of dance. \u2022 Elizabeth-Jane Burnett is the author of The Grassling (Allen Lane) \u2018The lido represents convivial, multicultural London at its best\u2019 Johny Pitts, Brockwell lido I once heard someone describe their depression in the following terms: \u201cEven if the sun is out and the sky is blue, you feel awful. As though the jolly weather is mocking the storm you\u2019re carrying inside.\u201d It made me think of London in the summer: overpacked festivals, sociopathic cyclists, expensive beer and gentrified car parks selling \u201cstreet food\u201d at exorbitant prices to trust-funded art students. I watch all this from a distance, too knackered to join in even when I can afford to, seeing the culture that sustained me growing up working-class in Britain \u2013 brutalist architecture, street markets and secondhand shops \u2013 culturally reappropriated in a way that precludes my involvement. I cheer myself up by reimagining this tough, corporate-in-disguise metropolis as my own personal bohemia, and my search for simple pleasures often leads me to Herne Hill. On the way I cycle past streets named after Langston Hughes, Derek Walcott and Alice Walker. I\u2019ll buy a patty for \u00a31.50 at Mina\u2019s Caribbean takeaway, and wander Brockwell Park, surely one of the prettiest in London, without the pomp of Regent\u2019s Park or the anxious trendiness of London Fields. Like the latter, Brockwell also has its own streamline moderne lido, making it look like the backdrop for an episode of Poirot, though the only death here is of one\u2019s own stress. During the summer months the lido is quieter in the evening and just the right temperature, cool enough to be bracing, warm enough after a few strokes to encourage you to carry on. Fifteen minutes or so into my swim my goggles begin to steam up, but I don\u2019t wipe them, preferring to let myself exist for the best part of an hour in a world shrouded in mist. Once I\u2019m in the zone, I don\u2019t hear anything but the reassuring thud of my own pumping circulation and a consoling subaqueous muffle. I used to count lengths, but now I just swim at roughly 75% exertion for 45 minutes to allow my mind to drift off. I problem solve and write as I swim \u2013 I composed some of this essay beneath the water; somehow the work that takes place there is devoid of anxiety. A later analysis may disprove my theory, but I only have \u201cgood\u201d ideas when I\u2019m submerged, feeling free and creative. I marvel at my human capability as I ply through dead insects in the water \u2013 even though it may seem a humble skill (and I swim badly), I can\u2019t believe that my body is making all the minute adjustments it needs to keep itself fluent in the language of the aquatic, while my mind is firmly elsewhere. It wasn\u2019t always this way. My mother nearly drowned when she was a child, and never learned to swim, instilling the same mistrust of bodies of water into my own childhood. I first acquired breaststroke in my early 20s, in extraordinary circumstances; taught in the creek of a rainforest in eastern Australia by Clionna, a swimming instructor from Ireland I\u2019d befriended while backpacking. Perhaps that\u2019s why outdoor swimming strikes me as so liberating \u2013 it\u2019s where I found my flow. I grew up in a multicultural, working-class urban area, and despite being only a 25-minute drive from the glorious Derwent Valley in the Peak District, as a black kid I felt culturally and spiritually disconnected from the natural amenities of swimming, camping and climbing on my doorstep. It was the 90s, and in the wake of Thatcherism, civic spaces had fallen out of favour \u2013 my memories are of dried up drinking fountains and derelict paddling pools. In the early 90s, Brockwell lido suffered a similar fate, falling into a state of disrepair, and ultimately closing for more than a decade, before being reopened by a charity. This is why it\u2019s so nice to see such a mix of people enjoying the lido now; it\u2019s unlike so many spaces in the city \u2013 an inexpensive (free for residents on certain days) community space that\u2019s oversubscribed. Yes, it can get annoyingly crowded (as the police found out when it was stormed by 500 people trying to cool off in the recent heatwave), but mostly it represents convivial, multicultural London at its best, and I always emerge from the water feeling calm, centred, revitalised. Ready to head back into the burning Babylon. \u2022 Afropean: Notes From Black Europe by Johny Pitts is out now (Allen Lane) \u2018By summer the water is as warm as a bath\u2019 Esther Freud, Suffolk For more than 30 years I\u2019ve been swimming in the same sea, stepping out over the same stretch of beach \u2013 half sand, half shingle \u2013 just east of a small village on the Suffolk coast. I learned to swim in an old stone pool in the grounds of my school, and from there migrated to a freezing lake, so cold it ran a cracking ring around your skull, which may be why this most easterly stretch of the North Sea feels familiarly embracing. For years \u2013 decades \u2013 I considered myself hardy, perplexing my duffel-coated friends as they hunkered on the beach in June, unswayed by my much repeated assertion that they\u2019d feel great, afterwards, if they joined me in the water. But four years ago, when I challenged myself to swim throughout the year, I realised I hardly knew this sea at all. It was forever changing once I arrived to greet it at the same time every morning. Wild and rough; rust brown and green; flat as a millpond; metal grey; mother of pearl; silver. It kept its warmth right through the autumn. December was manageable, but the chill, once it settled, lasted late into the spring. In March, a Siberian ice floe seized you by the ankles, and if you listened, urged you to get out. In May, it beat your heart, scalded your skin, left you glowing and refuelled. By summer the water ( I have been accused of exaggeration) is warm as a bath. This year I spent a week in Scotland, driving through the West Highlands, up over the north coast and down again along the east. When we arrived it was raining so hard I could hardly see the hire car, let alone the bay, but on the second day, when it was only drizzling, I ran down to the shore at Glenuig. The water was crystal clear, the sea bed thick with shells and minnows, jellyfish and clams. I had a great desire to strike out to Samalaman island opposite, not so very far, but I didn\u2019t know the sea here \u2013 its tides and currents \u2013 and alone in the water, I turned back. Travelling north, I swam off a coral beach \u2013 seaweed, tall as overshot allium, sprouting above the surface, mist keeping other visitors away; and as we rounded the tip of Britain, the evening sun came out over Durness and I swam out to a curve of boulders. I would have swum on, but there was nothing beyond but Iceland, over 1,000km away. Driving south again I kept my eyes out for the perfect bay for my last swim, and it wasn\u2019t until we stopped on the edge of Loch Ness, to take a tour of Urquhart Castle, that I found a sheltered shingle beach. And to the surprise of the Philadelphian woman Instagramming her way around the ruins, I whipped off my clothes, pulled on my costume and struck out into the loch. It was clear and warm and fathoms deep, and my heart hammered with the knowledge there was more water here than in all the lakes of England and Wales combined. When I came out I was ecstatic. This swim would last me through the long train journey home. Back in Suffolk the sea was brown and green. All the same, I was pleased to see it; to know its dips and shallows, the strength of its current, at what moment, at its roughest, to throw yourself in. There were my friends, swimming converts themselves now, and our children, most of them grown, waiting at the agreed morning hour. The first swim was more of a wade, the tide was so far out. The next, later that day, close up against the shore. The third, the night after a storm, the sand treacly, the water refreshing as champagne. And the fourth had wild whipping waves, warm and jubilant. They swept us up, cascaded us down, chasing hard as we scrambled for the shore, so that, safely out, we stood in the sunshine, our towels flapping, remonstrating happily over whether or not that was the best swim yet. \u2022 Esther Freud is the author of Mr Mac And Me (Bloomsbury) \u2018I cycle to the shore at dawn, and launch naked into the unknown\u2019 Philip Hoare, south coast The sea is the only place I feel comfortable. Perhaps it\u2019s because I didn\u2019t learn to swim till I was in my early 30s. (My angel was an elderly lady in an East End of London public baths; she wore a rubber hat with daisies on it.) Now, every morning, I get out of bed and cycle to the shore \u2013 before dawn, often at 3am, in the dark, even in the winter. I know the place so well that I recognise individual stones on the beach. I launch, naked, into the unknown. Where else can you leave everything behind so effortlessly? Everyone is beautiful in the water. The sea is queer; the ultimate transformer. It starts with the animals and plants. They merge into one another, still evolving. Take the slipper shell. One of our most common shellfish \u2013 shaped as its name suggests, with a tactile little shelf in its white interior. When you find these little beauties on the shore, they\u2019re often attached, one to the other, sometimes seven in a row, in a little communal tower. In fact, as Philip Street revealed in his newly republished book from 1961, Shell Life On The Seashore, they\u2019re creatures caught in the moment of transition. The lowest shell is female, the topmost male \u2013 the others are gradually changing, little by little, from male to female. I\u2019m not going to tell you where my beach is. We regular swimmers prize our private places. Not that newcomers aren\u2019t welcome. According to a marine biologist friend, the south coast waters in which I swim are inhabited by the greatest number of \u201calien species\u201d in the UK. I recently spent the afternoon at a Cornish cove. I\u2019d been given directions by a local \u2013 through a hole in a hedge and down to a shingle shore. It was loved and cared for. Swimmers came and went, shifting their towels and cans of beer inland as the tide rolled in. As I swam out into the bay, I looked back and realised a spell had come over everyone. People had put down their phones, forsaking digital screens for the big blue screen in front of them. Dogs and children ran free. Time had stopped \u2013 but not the sea. I picked up a shell. It seemed to contain the afternoon in it. I remembered how, as a boy, the beach was the world for me \u2013 its terror, and its infinity. Now its darkness is my resort, the safest place I know. The sea and the shore mean many things \u2013 heartbreak and hope, mortality and beauty, transience and persistence. Its withdrawal is a little death; its return, absolute life. We all came to being in the amniotic sea of our mothers\u2019 bellies. We measure our passing summers by the sea, and invest its vastness with our yearning. I\u2019m not sure our souls would exist without it. Jung called it the symbol of our collective unconscious, but I\u2019m not sure you can apply any words to it. It is just there, moving in and out, of itself \u2013 the sea inside us all. \u2022 Philip Street\u2019s Shell Life On The Seashore, with an introduction by Philip Hoare, is published by Faber.

If they did, they might start to notice that Carlson\u2019s rhetoric about non-white people has long been virtually identical to that of white supremacist terrorists in New Zealand and El Paso. Here, for example, is a passage from Carlson\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Ship-Fools-Selfish-Bringing-Revolution/dp/1501183664\">most recent book</a>, on the topic of why \u201cdiversity\u201d makes us weaker:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When confronted or pressed for details, [proponents of diversity] retreat into a familiar platitude, which they repeat like a zen koan: diversity is our strength. But is diversity our strength? The less we have in common, the stronger we are? Is that true of families? Is it true in neighborhoods or businesses? Of course not. Then why is it true of America? Nobody knows. Nobody\u2019s even allowed to ask the question.</p> </blockquote> <p>And here is an excerpt from the manifesto issued by the man who <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christchurch_mosque_shootings\">killed 51 people</a> in a New Zealand mosque:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Why is diversity said to be our greatest strength? Does anyone even ask why? It is spoken like a mantra and repeated ad infinitum \u2026 But no one ever seems to give a reason why. What gives a nation strength? And how does diversity increase that strength? What part of diversity causes this increase in strength? No one can give an answer.</p> </blockquote> <p>Likewise, the El Paso killer spoke of the need to combat Hispanic \u201cinvasion\u201d of Texas. (Not realizing, apparently, that \u201cEl Paso\u201d has been Hispanic <a href=\"https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hde01\">since the 1500s</a>. Next the white nationalists will be complaining about people speaking Spanish in Los Angeles or New Mexico.) The same \u201cinvasion\u201d rhetoric <a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/fox-news-invasion-rhetoric-numbers\">comes out of</a> Carlson\u2019s mouth on his show, where he spreads <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hRpWZe0lbw\">phony crime statistics</a> designed to terrify people about immigrant populations.</p> <p>Carlson has made it clear that he thinks having more members of non-white racial groups is bad. In his book he writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Thanks to mass immigration, America has experienced greater demographic change in the last few decades than any other country in history has undergone during peacetime. If you grew up in America, suddenly nothing looks the same. Your neighbors are different. So is the landscape and the customs and very often the languages you hear on the street. You may not recognize your own hometown. Human beings aren\u2019t wired for that. [W]e are told these changes are entirely good. We must celebrate the fact that a nation that was overwhelmingly European, Christian, and English-speaking fifty years ago has become a place with no ethnic majority, immense religious pluralism, and no universally shared culture or language.</p> </blockquote> <p>Most conservatives don\u2019t dare speak overtly about the need to maintain a white \u201cethnic majority\u201d. Carlson is different. He wants to make sure the country \u201clooks the same\u201d, meaning that it doesn\u2019t have too many brown people in it. After all, \u201chuman beings aren\u2019t wired for that\u201d. It\u2019s talking points like these, which directly echo Richard Spencer\u2019s call for a white ethno-state, that make Carlson the darling of neo-Nazis. The Daily Stormer has <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/josephbernstein/tucker-carlson-fox-news-daily-stormers-favorite-pundit\">called him</a> \u201cliterally our greatest ally\u201d and David Duke <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/07/21/vox_why_white_supremacists_love_tucker_carlson_.html\">has said</a>: \u201cGod bless Tucker Carlson.\u201d</p> <p>Carlson <a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/2018/11/what-the-left-must-fight-against\">has developed</a> a dangerous ideological brew that combines economic populism with white nationalism. (A kind of \u201cnational socialism\u201d, if you will.) Notice that in his original comments, he talks about the need to focus on \u201cclass\u201d.</p> <p>He comments that \u201cworkers of all races\u201d have more in common with each other than they do with the rich, and believes talk of white supremacy is designed to keep them from getting \u201cunauthorized ideas about economics\u201d. In fact, on economic issues Carlson <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/eriksherman/2018/11/09/bernie-sanders-and-tucker-carlson-agree-on-income-inequality-why-cant-democrats-and-republicans/#1254511d1de7\">often sounds</a> very close to Berne Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-amazon-jeff-bezos-walmart-ceo-at-a-certain-point-youve-made-enough-money\">condemning</a> giant predatory companies like Amazon and skewering free-market dogma.</p> <p>Of course, as a leftist, I think Carlson is right about that part, and when he says that workers have more in common with each other than with the boss, he could be quoting a pamphlet from the <a href=\"https://www.iww.org/content/about-iww\">Wobblies</a>. But that\u2019s precisely why his anti-immigrant material is so wrong and toxic.</p> <p>The solution to class inequality is for workers to band together. Yet Carlson speaks of an \u201cinvasion\u201d in which poor Hispanics are coming for the jobs of slightly-less-poor whites, who must preserve their \u201cethnic majority\u201d. He says that it\u2019s the \u201celites\u201d who want to divide the working class, then tells people to be scared of their Muslim neighbors. If class is \u201cthe real divide in this country\u201d then why is he also claiming that \u201cdiversity\u201d is tearing us apart?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/08/trump-facebook-ads-target-latinos-anti-immigrant\">Trump campaign\u2019s Facebook ads target Latinos in Texas days after shooting</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Carlson may not even notice what he is doing, or realize that he has a \u201cwhite nationalist\u201d viewpoint. That\u2019s, in part, because he accepts the definition of racism as \u201cracial hatred\u201d. Instead, we should define it as valuing people of different races differently, and accepting a racial hierarchy of wealth and power as natural. If you care about what happens to white auto workers, but don\u2019t care about what happens to Guatemalans or Somalis, that\u2019s racism.</p> <p>Carlson thinks about the experience of the white person with an immigrant neighbor, but not about that of the immigrant neighbor.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s not surprising Tucker Carlson doesn\u2019t think white supremacy is a threat to the United States. It\u2019s easy not to notice a problem when the problem is you. Speaking on his show, Carlson called widespread racism a \u201choax\u201d and said: \u201cJust like the Russia hoax, it\u2019s a conspiracy theory used to divide the country and keep a hold on power.\u201d Carlson encouraged viewers not to think about racism, saying that \u201cevery minute you\u2019re angry about race is a minute you\u2019re not thinking about class, which is of course the real divide in this country\u201d. If I were Tucker Carlson, I wouldn\u2019t want people to think about racism either. If they did, they might start to notice that Carlson\u2019s rhetoric about non-white people has long been virtually identical to that of white supremacist terrorists in New Zealand and El Paso. Here, for example, is a passage from Carlson\u2019s most recent book, on the topic of why \u201cdiversity\u201d makes us weaker: When confronted or pressed for details, [proponents of diversity] retreat into a familiar platitude, which they repeat like a zen koan: diversity is our strength. But is diversity our strength? The less we have in common, the stronger we are? Is that true of families? Is it true in neighborhoods or businesses? Of course not. Then why is it true of America? Nobody knows. Nobody\u2019s even allowed to ask the question. And here is an excerpt from the manifesto issued by the man who killed 51 people in a New Zealand mosque: Why is diversity said to be our greatest strength? Does anyone even ask why? It is spoken like a mantra and repeated ad infinitum \u2026 But no one ever seems to give a reason why. What gives a nation strength? And how does diversity increase that strength? What part of diversity causes this increase in strength? No one can give an answer. Likewise, the El Paso killer spoke of the need to combat Hispanic \u201cinvasion\u201d of Texas. (Not realizing, apparently, that \u201cEl Paso\u201d has been Hispanic since the 1500s. Next the white nationalists will be complaining about people speaking Spanish in Los Angeles or New Mexico.) The same \u201cinvasion\u201d rhetoric comes out of Carlson\u2019s mouth on his show, where he spreads phony crime statistics designed to terrify people about immigrant populations. Carlson has made it clear that he thinks having more members of non-white racial groups is bad. In his book he writes: Thanks to mass immigration, America has experienced greater demographic change in the last few decades than any other country in history has undergone during peacetime. If you grew up in America, suddenly nothing looks the same. Your neighbors are different. So is the landscape and the customs and very often the languages you hear on the street. You may not recognize your own hometown. Human beings aren\u2019t wired for that. [W]e are told these changes are entirely good. We must celebrate the fact that a nation that was overwhelmingly European, Christian, and English-speaking fifty years ago has become a place with no ethnic majority, immense religious pluralism, and no universally shared culture or language. Most conservatives don\u2019t dare speak overtly about the need to maintain a white \u201cethnic majority\u201d. Carlson is different. He wants to make sure the country \u201clooks the same\u201d, meaning that it doesn\u2019t have too many brown people in it. After all, \u201chuman beings aren\u2019t wired for that\u201d. It\u2019s talking points like these, which directly echo Richard Spencer\u2019s call for a white ethno-state, that make Carlson the darling of neo-Nazis. The Daily Stormer has called him \u201cliterally our greatest ally\u201d and David Duke has said: \u201cGod bless Tucker Carlson.\u201d Carlson has developed a dangerous ideological brew that combines economic populism with white nationalism. (A kind of \u201cnational socialism\u201d, if you will.) Notice that in his original comments, he talks about the need to focus on \u201cclass\u201d. He comments that \u201cworkers of all races\u201d have more in common with each other than they do with the rich, and believes talk of white supremacy is designed to keep them from getting \u201cunauthorized ideas about economics\u201d. In fact, on economic issues Carlson often sounds very close to Berne Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, condemning giant predatory companies like Amazon and skewering free-market dogma. Of course, as a leftist, I think Carlson is right about that part, and when he says that workers have more in common with each other than with the boss, he could be quoting a pamphlet from the Wobblies. But that\u2019s precisely why his anti-immigrant material is so wrong and toxic. The solution to class inequality is for workers to band together. Yet Carlson speaks of an \u201cinvasion\u201d in which poor Hispanics are coming for the jobs of slightly-less-poor whites, who must preserve their \u201cethnic majority\u201d. He says that it\u2019s the \u201celites\u201d who want to divide the working class, then tells people to be scared of their Muslim neighbors. If class is \u201cthe real divide in this country\u201d then why is he also claiming that \u201cdiversity\u201d is tearing us apart? Carlson may not even notice what he is doing, or realize that he has a \u201cwhite nationalist\u201d viewpoint. That\u2019s, in part, because he accepts the definition of racism as \u201cracial hatred\u201d. Instead, we should define it as valuing people of different races differently, and accepting a racial hierarchy of wealth and power as natural. If you care about what happens to white auto workers, but don\u2019t care about what happens to Guatemalans or Somalis, that\u2019s racism. Carlson thinks about the experience of the white person with an immigrant neighbor, but not about that of the immigrant neighbor. Carlson believes that white supremacy isn\u2019t a problem because \u201cThe combined membership of every white supremacist organization in this country would be able to fit inside a college football stadium.\u201d It\u2019s true that outright neo-Nazi groups are fringe. But if racial \u201chatred\u201d is marginal, acceptance of racial hierarchy is ubiquitous. And the people who believe in that don\u2019t need neo-Nazi groups, because they\u2019ve got Fox News. We should hesitate to directly blame particular killings on the media. After all, an unstable person can pick up bad ideas from anywhere. But when people like Carlson say that diversity is destabilizing the country, and there is an active invasion that will wipe out \u201cour\u201d people\u2019s culture, they make armed attacks sound rationally justified. Even on the assumption that violent white supremacy remains marginal for the moment, the more Carlson persuades people of his anti-immigrant talking points, the more people may be tempted to reach for a gun to \u201csolve the problem\u201d themselves. I, too, wish we could focus on economic divides, but we can\u2019t so long as Carlson\u2019s nightly diatribes are making the United States an ever more terrifying place for immigrants and people of color.",

      "body": "<p>Tension, despair, doom, lunacy and death \u2013 not new concepts to the oeuvre of Nick Cave and violinist Warren Ellis. These moods run rich through the Australian musicians\u2019 monumental catalogue of work, whether together in the Bad Seeds or in Ellis\u2019s elemental The Dirty Three. </p> <p>But Friday night\u2019s world premiere of selections from their 15 years of collaborative film scores, part of the Melbourne International Film festival and backed by the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, proved a fresh angle \u2013 how when masterfully conjuring humanity\u2019s grim interior, you can also have a bit of a laugh.</p> <p>This is heavy music. Not the thundering clang recognisable in their bands at full tilt, but a solemnity that inks across barren landscapes, built from low drones, Cave\u2019s skeletal piano, and the uneasy whump of an orchestra stirring under the tug of Ellis\u2019s raw bow. So light relief is the privilege of watching two friends \u2013 local country boys from Warracknabeal and Ballarat respectively \u2013 returning home to muck around with an orchestra for a bit.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/apr/15/nick-cave-red-hand-files-rock-music-fan-letter-response\">Nick Cave: 'Perhaps rock music needs to die for a while'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sauntering on stage in their customary mafioso-by-the-pool finery \u2013 black suits, gold rings, starched collars \u2013 the pair spent much of the night pointing and grinning at each other. Perhaps this was partly at having to cede alpha male status to conductor Benjamin Northey, who ran the operation at centre stage. With the grey-haired Ellis planted on the hip of the string section, Cave flitted between grand piano and a mic at lip of the stage \u2013 just enough room to arch, mince and make finger pistols.</p> <p>This came in especially handy for the night\u2019s first suite from The Proposition, John Hillcoat\u2019s violent 2005 Australian-Western.

      "bodyText": "Tension, despair, doom, lunacy and death \u2013 not new concepts to the oeuvre of Nick Cave and violinist Warren Ellis. These moods run rich through the Australian musicians\u2019 monumental catalogue of work, whether together in the Bad Seeds or in Ellis\u2019s elemental The Dirty Three. But Friday night\u2019s world premiere of selections from their 15 years of collaborative film scores, part of the Melbourne International Film festival and backed by the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, proved a fresh angle \u2013 how when masterfully conjuring humanity\u2019s grim interior, you can also have a bit of a laugh. This is heavy music. Not the thundering clang recognisable in their bands at full tilt, but a solemnity that inks across barren landscapes, built from low drones, Cave\u2019s skeletal piano, and the uneasy whump of an orchestra stirring under the tug of Ellis\u2019s raw bow. So light relief is the privilege of watching two friends \u2013 local country boys from Warracknabeal and Ballarat respectively \u2013 returning home to muck around with an orchestra for a bit. Sauntering on stage in their customary mafioso-by-the-pool finery \u2013 black suits, gold rings, starched collars \u2013 the pair spent much of the night pointing and grinning at each other. Perhaps this was partly at having to cede alpha male status to conductor Benjamin Northey, who ran the operation at centre stage. With the grey-haired Ellis planted on the hip of the string section, Cave flitted between grand piano and a mic at lip of the stage \u2013 just enough room to arch, mince and make finger pistols. This came in especially handy for the night\u2019s first suite from The Proposition, John Hillcoat\u2019s violent 2005 Australian-Western. Hinging on the score\u2019s The Rider #1-#3, Cave breathlessly opened with an existential Q&amp;A: \u201cWhen?\u2019 said the moon to the stars in the sky, \u2018Soon\u2019 said the wind that followed them all,\u201d as footage of blazing red sand and outback chaos saturated three screens above the orchestra. The set was broken into six sections, each flagged with a title card and snippets from the corresponding movie \u2013 an effective signposting of the subtle tonal shifts in the pair\u2019s signature violin and piano framework. The strut and country strings of The Proposition gave way to the sombre beauty of 2013\u2019s West of Memphis. Led by Ellis and Northey, the melancholic Eyewitness came soothed by the former\u2019s unmistakeable boxy rake; the Elizabethan-like lilt of West Memphis 3, featuring Cave on piano, its graceful lyrical counterpoint. Dissonant squalls announced The Road, John Hillcoat\u2019s fearsome 2009 adaptation of Cormac McCarthy\u2019s bleak dystopian 2006 novel. As scenes of a haggard Viggo Mortensen prodding his son through an apocalyptic landscape grew more desperate, the nostalgic title track was shunted aside for the clattering The House, Cave hopping up to gleefully huff and puff into the mic and amplify the suddenly menacing orchestra\u2019s distended lope. Their work lends itself well to these moments \u2013 spare beauty and shuddering horror bookending all the demons of man (and the protagonists on the night were all men). Airier passages from Hell or High Water, the 2016 US neo-Western, introduce more propulsion, with menacing bass and gloomy \u201coohs\u201d of a now rising choir on From My Dead Hands suggesting the discovery of further wells of doom here in the recesses of Hamer Hall. Cave departs and returns with operatic soprano Antoinette Halloran on wordless trills to mark the segue into 2017\u2019s Wind River.

This is yet another worthy incarnation of the band called Fleetwood Mac, and as the members \u2013 older and newer \u2013 sauntered offstage it was a rather emotional Fleetwood who farewelled the full-house with the words, \u201cbe kind to one another. We love you so much\u201d. The saga that continues to be Fleetwood Mac suggests that kindness may have taken a backseat on occasion, as it does for us all. However as the Peter Green-penned instrumental Albatross echoes across the arena upon exit, it\u2019s another reminder that what truly remains is the music: from all of those Fleetwood Mac members, and for all of us. \u2022 Fleetwood Mac\u2019s Australian tour continues through August and September, before the band head to New Zealand on September 14",
