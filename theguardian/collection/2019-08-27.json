      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for our day session coverage. Thanks as always for following along and be sure to check back for full reports off tonight\u2019s night session matches. No 9 seed Karen Khachanov is out of the US Open after a shock 4-6, 7-5, 7-5, 4-6, 6-3 loss to Vasek Pospisil! The 23-year-old Russian becomes the fourth top-10 seed to crash out of the men\u2019s draw today after No 4 Dominic Thiem, No 8 Stefanos Tsitsipas and No 10 Roberto Bautista Agut. Madness. Coco Gauff is through to the US Open second round after rallying for a 3-6, 6-2, 6-4 win over Anastasia Potapova. A wildly entertaining match between a pair of wildly talented teenagers ends with Gauff breaking her opponent. She tips her cap to the home support during an on-court interview with ESPN\u2019s Pam Shriver: \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s because of the crowd. You guys were amazing. No matter where I was on the court, I could always hear somebody supporting me and I really am grateful for that.\u201d Pospisil has broken the ninth-seeded Khachanov for 4-2 in the fifth and moves within two holds of yet another high-profile men\u2019s upset. Over on Armstrong the pressure only builds as Gauff is showing signs of tightness at 4-all in the third against the game Potapova. Gauff, serving at 4-2, falls behind 15-40 to give Potapova a pair of break-point chances in their pressure-packed showcase on Armstrong. But the American follows with her third double fault of the day to gift her opponent the break and we\u2019re on serve in the third. Also on serve in a deciding set: No 9 seed Karen Khachanov is serving at 2-3 in a touch-and-go battle with Canada\u2019s Vasel Pospisil. Elsewhere, another Canadian upset bid is fastly unfolding as unseeded Denis Shapovalov has taken a 6-1, 6-1 lead over a listless Felix Auger-Allassime, the No 18 seed. Coco Gauff is ahead 4-1 in the third set as Potapova takes a medical timeout for her right shoulder. The young American is in fine shape here with the second round within touching distance. Meanwhile, Frances Tiafoe is through to round two after Ivo Karlovic, who dropped the first two sets, retires early in the third. The all-Canadian battle between Denis Shapovalov and Felix Auger-Aliassime is under way and it\u2019s been one-way traffic so far. The unseeded Shapovalov raced to a pair of breaks to win 6-1 in the opener. Should it continue this way and Auger-Aliassime go out, it would leave No 13 Gael Monfils, No 24 Mateo Berrettini and No 28 Nick Kyrgios as the only seeds in that entire quarter of the men\u2019s draw. Tennys Sandgren has completed a gripping comeback from two sets down to win 1-6, 6-7 (2), 6-4, 7-6 (5), 7-5 over Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. The 2018 Australian Open quarter-finalist survived a tense fourth-set tiebreak on Court 5 before earning his second break of the match in the fifth and landing the plane. He advances to face the winner of the Karen Khachanov-Vasek Pospisil match that\u2019s just headed to a fifth set on Court 12. Well, well, well. Coco Gauff bounces back from an underwhelming opening set to run away with the second by a 6-2 score and we\u2019re headed to a decider on Armstrong. The American teenager is putting a bit more air under her shots to change the pace of the rallies and showing more variety in her shotmaking, mixing in drop shots and net approaches with great effect. They both went off court ahead of the third set for bathroom breaks and will resume shortly. Dominic Thiem attributed his four-set loss Thomas Fabbiano to the illness that\u2019s sapped his strength for most of the month. Said the 25-year-old Austrian during an abbreviated press conference beneath Arthur Ashe Stadium: \u201cWhat happened is what I said before the tournament: that I\u2019ll play, I\u2019ll be able to play the match, but I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. I got very, very tired and exhausted after two sets. I\u2019m far away from 100%. Like this, it\u2019s very tough to win. I went on court because in tennis, especially in such long two-week tournaments, anything can happen. But it is what it is.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019m honest with you that, I mean, congratulations to [Fabbiano] and I\u2019m happy for him. But it was not the real me there on the court. All I was thinking about was me, how I somehow can win the match. But I don\u2019t know how much his performance is worth because was not against the real me. That\u2019s why.\u201d Gauff is back on course in the second set after immediately breaking back for 1-all, then consolidating with a drama-free hold. Meanwhile, yet another big name is in trouble as No 9 seed Karen Khachanov finds himself down two sets to one against 216th-ranked Vasek Pospisil of Canada out on Court 12. Could the 23-year-old Russian become the fourth top-10 seed to crash out today after No 4 Dominic Thiem, No 8 Stefanos Tsitsipas and No 10 Roberto Bautista Agut? Coco Gauff\u2019s first major since her Wimbledon breakthrough is off to a rocky start. Her opponent, Russia\u2019s Anastasia Potapova, capitalized on both her break-point chances in the early going to race to a 5-1 lead in the opening set before a rollicking crowd on Armstrong, but the 15-year-old American has just pulled one of them back with a backhand winner on break point before holding at love with new balls for 3-5. Potapova will now have a second chance to serve for the first set. Elsewhere, the American Tennys Sandgren has scratched back from two sets down to force a decider against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga on Court 5. We weren\u2019t lying when we said it was getting a wee bit wild in the quarter formerly known as Thiem\u2019s. The No 4, No 8, No 10 and No 30 seeds have all gone out in the last few hours, leaving only No 13 Gael Monfils, No 18 Felix Auger-Aliassime, No 24 Mateo Berrettini and No 28 Nick Kyrgios still standing and all but guaranteeing a semi-finalist that could be safely be qualified as a surprise. The emerging American star Coco Gauff has taken the court for her first-rounder against Russian teenager Anastasia Potapova. This is a bit of a tricker match for Gauff than it might appear on paper: The 18-year-old is a former junior No 1 and won the Wimbledon girls\u2019 title in 2016. Here\u2019s our Tumaini Carayol\u2019s lookahead to the match. Thomas Fabbiano strikes again, dumping fourth-seeded Dominic Thiem from the US Open in a 6-4, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2 upset! It\u2019s the second high-profile scalp for the giant-killing Italian in as many major tournaments after his first-round win over Stefanos Tsitsipas at Wimbledon. That leaves No 2 Rafael Nadal and No 6 Alexander Zverev \u2013 whom it appears will survive an upset scare against Moldova\u2019s Radu Albot on Court 17 \u2013 as the only top-10 seeds remaining in this half of the draw. Kyle Edmund is out of the US Open after a gutting 3-6, 7-6 (1), 7-5, 5-7, 6-2 defeat to Spain\u2019s Pablo And\u00fajar. The British No 1 dropped the final six games on the trot, but can take some minor consolation in knowing his ranking won\u2019t take a hit given his first-round ouster at Flushing Meadows last year. Meanwhile, Thiem is on the brink of elimination on Ashe with Fabbiano serving for the match at 5-2 in the fourth ... It\u2019s all come undone for Edmund! Moments after And\u00fajar consolidates his break for 4-2, the No 30 seed is broken at love with a series of misfires off the backhand side. And\u00fajar will serve for the match at 5-2 after the changeover. And\u00fajar has nosed ahead in the fifth set against Edmund, breaking for a 3-2 lead on Court 13. The British No 1 managed to save four break points in marathon 18-point game, but And\u00fajar finally came through on his fifth chance with a backhand winner from the baseline. On Armstrong, Simona Halep is through to the second round after ending her two-match losing streak at the US Open with a 6-3, 3-6, 6-2 win over the feisty Nicole Gibbs. Deciders abound! As Edmund and And\u00fajar are locked at 2-all in the fifth set, Radu Albot has just forced a fifth from two sets down against the sixth-seeded Alexander Zverev on Court 17. Meanwhile, Halep has scored an early break against Gibbs in the third set on Armstrong. Excitement all around the grounds on a breezy 23C (73F) afternoon in Queens. Halep and Gibbs are heading to a decider after a gripping end to the second set. With the Wimbledon champion trailing 2-5 after taking the opener from the American lucky loser, Halep saves no less than six set points to break her opponent\u2019s serve ... but Gibbs immediately breaks back and we\u2019re headed to a third set on Armstrong. Meanwhile on Ashe, Dominic Thiem is in serious trouble after falling behind 2-5 in the third set against Italy\u2019s Thomas Fabbiano having already dropped the first. What a turn for Edmund! He\u2019s just broken And\u00fajar at love, capping the game with a backhand winner down the line punctuated by a fist pump, that\u2019s leveled the score at 6-3, 6-7 (1), 5-7, 7-5 after three hours and 34 minutes. We\u2019re heading to a decider on Court 13. Kyle Edmund is in a quite a fight on Court 13 against Spain\u2019s Pablo And\u00fajar. The No 30 seed and British No 1, who dropped the second and third sets after taking the opener, has just held for 6-5 in the fourth. The Spaniard will now serve to force a tie-breaker. Gibbs has broken early in the second set against the fourth-seeded Halep, a promising turn after losing three straight games to drop the opener. The American hit a lovely forehand volley winner on break point to cap an 11-shot rally, bringing the partisan Armstrong crowd to life. Elsewhere, Gilles has taken out American wild card Bjorn Frantangelo by a 5-7, 7-5, 7-5, 7-5 scoreline, a match that included a whopping 48 break points over four hours and 19 minutes. Stefanos Tsitsipas addressed his on-court spat with chair umpire Damien Dumusois during today\u2019s first-round loss to Andrey Rublev. The 21-year-old Greek, who battled cramps during the business end of the nearly four-hour match, was vocally perturbed after receiving a point penalty for a second time violation. Q. As you had the argument with the chair umpire, could you take us through what made you so upset? You were heard saying, \u2018You\u2019re all weirdos.\u2019 Who were you talking about? STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: The chair umpire was very incorrect in what he was telling me during the match. I don\u2019t know what this chair umpire has in specific against my team but he\u2019s been complaining and telling me that my team talks all of the time when I\u2019m out on the court playing. He\u2019s very \u2013 I don\u2019t know. I believe he\u2019s not right, because I never hear anything of what my team says from the outside. And there is nothing that I personally believe can help my game or make me play better. My father outside, who usually does the talking, he\u2019s trying to pump me up by saying, you know, Come on. Raising my confidence by not coaching but by trying to boost me up. I believe the coach for my opponent does the same thing, which is normal. This chair umpire, I don\u2019t know, he has something against me. I don\u2019t know why. Q. So you\u2019re saying the chair umpires were weirdos? STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: I wish that all the chair umpires were like Mohamed Lahyani because I believe he\u2019s the best out in the game, and we need more like him in tennis because he\u2019s fair to everyone. I feel like some of them have preferences when they are on the court. Upset alert on Ashe as fourth-seeded Dominic Thiem has dropped the first set to Italy\u2019s Thomas Fabbiano. The world No 87 is no stranger to early-round upsets, having taken out Tsitsipas at the All England Club this summer. Meanwhile on Armstrong, Wimbledon champion Simona Halep is off to a promising start against the American Nicole Gibbs, nabbing an early break to race ahead in the opening set. Tsitsipas\u2019s section of the draw is even more wide open than it was before. He\u2019s out. No 10 seed Roberto Bautista Agut is out after a highly entertaining five-set loss to Mikhail Kukushkin. That leaves only two seeds remaining in the section: No 24 Matteo Berrettini and No 28 Nick Kyrgios. The second time\u2019s the charm for Andrey Rublev. After getting broken while serving for the match, the young Russian breaks right back and serves out the match to seal a 6-4, 6-7 (5), 7-6 (7), 7-5 win over the eighth-seeded Stefanos Tsitsipas. The cruel summer for the 21-year-old Greek and Australian Open semi-finalist continues: He was 32-11 on the year entering his French Open fourth-rounder against Stan Wawrinka, but has lost eight of 13 matches since including the last four on the trot. That\u2019s all from me. Bryan Armen Graham is at Flushing Meadows and will bring you all the action live from New York, including the finale of this dramatic match. Thanks for joining. Bye. Tsitsipas breaks to stay in the match. Rublev\u2019s fifth double fault opens the door and his second in a row widens that opening. That was a terrible second serve. Some Tsitsipas magic makes it 0-40 and a superb return from the Greek snatches the break. Suddenly it\u2019s 5-5 with all to play for. Tsitsipas holds serve to love and shows no signs of the cramps that have been troubling him. Rublev will serve for the match now though. Tsitsipas is all over the place in the fourth set against Rublev. He has played the last few games almost on one leg, with the medical staff on helping him carry on. He\u2019s also called the umpire a weirdo and now finds himself 5-3 down and two sets to one down. He needs to muster something from somewhere or the No 8 seed is out. Andujar wins the second set 7-6! Edmund has a terrible tie break record recently and an awful start to this one sees him 5-0 down in no time. He gets himself on the board but a poor backhand leaves him 6-1 behind. Six break points for Andujar and he takes the first on serve. That is poor from the British No 1. He was a break up and in control in that set but lost all momentum and was crushed in the tie break. It\u2019s a second set tie break for Edmund. He\u2019s not great at these. Naomi Osaka beats Anna Blinkova 6-4, 6-7, 6-2! Blinkova opens with a double fault as the shadows peer across the court. It\u2019s her fourth of the match. She avoids a fifth and Osaka finds the net with a forehand. That\u2019s the champion\u2019s 49th unforced error, to Blinkova\u2019s 21. Her 50th takes the game to 30-all but a brutal forehand return from Osaka sets up match point. A fine rally ends with an unerring backhand from Osaka and that\u2019s the match. Kyle Edmund has been broke back in the second set against Andujar and now finds himself at 5-5. Blinkova holds serve, and Osaka follows suit. It\u2019s 5-2 to the world No 1 in the final set now. Can she close out the match. Roberto Bautista Agut is out! A topsy turvy five-setter against Mikhail Kukushkin ends in defeat for the No 10 seed. That is a big win for the world No 47 from Kazakhstan, by a score of is 3-6, 6-1, 6-4, 3-6, 6-3. Blinkova will not lie down. She fights hard and forces a break-back point but Oskaka holds firm and wins through to go 4-1 up. Osaka puts her foot down and Blinkova struggles to cope. The defending champion saves break points on her own serve but escapes unscathed and harnesses that momentum to break her opponent\u2019s. It\u2019s 3-1 in the decider but we\u2019ve seen Osaka surge and drop off before in this match. Edmund broke early in the second set and is showing little sign of letting up. He\u2019s 4-2 and a set up on Andujar. Tsitsipas is back in trouble though. The third set tie break was as hard fought as the rest of the match and Rublev emerged the stronger, taking it 9-7 to go two sets to one up on the No 8 seed. Osaka and Blinkova are 1-1 in the deciding set. Blinkova wins the second set tie break to level the match against Osaka. It\u2019s first blood to the Russian in the tie break. She earns a mini-break then produces a sublime backhand winner to go 3-1 up. The crowd are urging Osaka on though and she responds, winning three points in a row. She has the edge but an incredible rally ends with Blinkova springing to her right to get back a seemingly impossible ball and make it 4-4. Two poor groundstrokes give Blinkova set point No 4. She cant take the first but wins the second when Osaka\u2019s return hits the tape. What a fighter Blinkova is. Game on. Blinkova breaks back to force a tie break against Osaka. The No 1 seed produces two poor errors to go 0-30 down but a fine swinging serve gets her into the game. A drilled forehand down the line and then a similar winner on the backhand side set up match point. Blinkova does not blink though, and goes on the attack to force deuce and then break point. And she holds her nerve to stay in the match. The surge in adrenaline after saving those set points seems to supercharge Osaka. She produces her best forehand of the match to close out her most impressive game of it. She breaks to love and will now serve for the match. Osaka saves three set points against Blinkova. A combination of errors from the Japanese and clever play from the youngster earn the chances to level the match but Osaka rouses herself to escape with the game. It\u2019s 5-5, but there\u2019s been huge pressure on the favourite\u2019s serve in this set. Marin Cilic was champion here five years ago and he looks in the mood to do some damage again. He\u2019s raced through the second set 6-2 and now leads Klizan by two sets to love. Meanwhile Bautista Agut has recovered his poise to take his match with Kukushkin to a fifth set, and Tsitsipas and Rublev are 5-5 in the third. Kyle Edmund takes the first set 6-3 against Andujar. A break in the eighth game proves the difference and the Briton serves out to put himself in charge of the match. Most people assumed Blinkova would fade away after losing the first set to Osaka, but she is hanging in there. The 20-year-old Russian shows immense steel amid some punishing forehands to hold serve and go 4-3 up. She has some talent. Edmund and Andujar are relentlessly trading blows from the baseline, but no far no one has buckled. It\u2019s 3-2 in the first set and going with serve, although the Briton looks the likelier to break. Hello all wherever you are. I arrive with news that Alison Riske has stormed back to beat Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza 2-6, 6-1, 6-3. The No 24 seed has had a poor year and it\u2019s getting worse. She looked to be in control there and imploded. Kyle Edmund is underway against Pablo Andujar. It\u2019s 1-1 in the first and, from here, Rob Bleaney is going to take care of you for the next little bit of the evening. Stay with him! Osaka fights off a break point, at advantage Blinkova, with a rapier-like forehand that her opponent can\u2019t return. Blinkova has perked up again here but can\u2019t manoeuvre herself into a repeat of the first set situation \u2013 it\u2019s now 1-1 in the second. Kukushkin now leads Bautista Agut by two sets to one, so there\u2019s a seed in real trouble. Cilic has got over that early scare against Klizan, winning the first set 6-3. Blinkova creditably clears her head with a service win to love at the start of the second set. Is she still in this? Fernando Verdasco, seeded 32, is 3-1 up in the first set against Tobias Kamke. The 35-year-old leads the 33-year-old! And Osaka takes the first set 6-4! That was tough stuff though; she\u2019s had a stern examination here, however the second pans out. Osaka and Blinkova are producing some lengthy rallies now, and it\u2019s taking more and more for the latter to stay in them. She saves one break point with a tremendous forehand but can\u2019t retrieve the next \u2013 Osaka breaks again and leads 5-4. She\u2019s recovered well from that early scare. Tumaini is on location. And he\u2019s not wrong. It\u2019s tight out there. Tsitsipas levels the match with Rublev! He was improving, wasn\u2019t he, and he took a tight tie-break 7-5. Ostapenko beat Krunic 6-3, 7-6 (9-7). Marin Cilic is out on court by the way, and is a break down to Martin Klizan already. Osaka is back in business! She breaks back to love, so it\u2019s 4-3 to Blinkova on serve. She\u2019s purring with some of those groundstrokes there. Has order been restored? Rublev and Tsitsipas will play a second-set tie-break ... I\u2019ll keep you posted on that. In the latest dramatic turnaround elsewhere, Riske leads Muguruza 5-1 in the second having lost the first 6-2. Blinkova forces a forehand error from Osaka, goes 4-1 up and yells \u201cCOME ON!\u201d. Osaka doesn\u2019t look at all right so far. Francesca Di Lorenzo has just beaten Veronika Kudermetova 7-6, 6-2. Osaka gets off the mark. Kvitova is serving for the match against Allertova. Meanwhile Cornet has beaten Pegula 6-2, 6-3. Blinkova goes 3-0 up and can have a free hit at Osaka\u2019s serve now, really. She\u2019s looking very positive and sharp. Tsitsipas and Rublev remain on serve as the second set reaches its business end. And she takes the first, so Osaka is in early trouble. Blinkova, the world No 84, is 2-0 up in the first set. Popyrin is now two sets up against Delbonis. Meanwhile Osaka is being given a good early test by Blinkova here \u2013 the underdog looks aggressive at the net and has two break points ... Kukushkin completed that turnaround against Bautista Agut, taking the second set 6-1 so it\u2019s one apiece. And another Kazakh has taken inspiration! Alexander Bublik went down 6-2 to Santiago Giraldo in their first set but has taken the second 6-2. Now Osaka is underway against the Russian, Blinkova. No boos today! Blinkova serves first and it\u2019s a nice start, with some good long rallies. It reaches deuce. Here\u2019s our first completed match of the day: Bencic defeats Minella 6-3, 6-2. Tsitsipas has broken back here \u2013 2-2 in the second \u2013 and this could completely galvanise his confidence, which was clearly lacking earlier. Men\u2019s 24th seed Matteo Berretini is a set up, 6-1, against Richard Gasquet. And Bautista Agut, who won comfortably enough in his first set against Kukushkin, is now 5-0 down in the second! Bit of a turnaround in that Vikhlyantseva v Gorges match. Remember how Gorges lost the first set 6-1? She\u2019s just won the second by that very score! Osaka gets underway quite soon, by the way, so we\u2019ll have a big focus on that match before long ... Rublev breaks in the second set! And it comes from a needless Tsitsipas double fault. He is firmly in the driving seat here now, leading 3-1. Kvitova won the first set against Allertova; Bencic is 3-1 up in the second set against Minella and closing in on a quickish victory. Only a sprinkling of fans watching this one, which is a shame as it\u2019s good fun. Rublev came under some pressure in his first service game of the second set but held to 30 and it\u2019s 1-1. Jelena Ostapenko, always a tricky prospect, leads Aleksandra Krunic by a set. So does Garbine Muguruza against Alison Riske. Rublev takes the first set 6-4 against Tsitsipas with a superb ace. So we could see a seed on the way out as things stand. This was one of the toughest first-round ties Tsitsipas could have faced, to be fair, and he\u2019s found Rublev to be in excellent nick. He\u2019s looked very smooth throughout. Men\u2019s tenth seed Roberto Bautista Agut, who has never got beyond the fifth round here, is a set up over the Kazakh player Mikhail Kukushkin. Meanwhile Tsitsipas certainly seems to be over that early wobble but Rublev will now serve for the set ... Bencic has battled back against Minella to win that first set 6-3. Aliza Cornet has taken the first set against US hope Jessica Pegula, winning 6-2. Twice quarter-finalist Petra Kvitova is among others in action right now. She\u2019s the sixth seed and, at 4-2 up in the first set against her compatriot Denisa Allertova, is looking good. Tsitsipas does seem to have got over that early knee problem and is showing signs of looking sharp around the net. He earns two break-back points ... the first goes begging and then he totally miscues a massive swing at Rublev\u2019s second serve to squander the next one. Rublev sails though deuce for 4-2. Popyrin has taken the first set 6-1 against Delbonis. That was quick! Almost as rapid is Natalia Vikhlyantseva, who has stormed to a 6-1 opening set lead over Julia Gorges. Rublev is all over the court at the moment, looking on very good form. He\u2019s just held to love and leads 3-1. Bencic has broken back against Minella, while Popyrin now leads Delbonis 4-1 in the first set. Rublev holds his serve to deuce and has control of the first set here \u2013 he leads 2-0. Greg emails: \u201cWhat price a Williams-Osaka rematch in the final? I\u2019m torn. I really want Serena to reach 24 slams but also feel bad about how Osaka didn\u2019t get to enjoy her victory last year. Thoughts?\u201d I\u2019d quite like a rematch too \u2013 as long as everyone around the court behaves properly, which shouldn\u2019t be too much to ask. On Court Eight, Alexei Popyrin and Federico Delbonis have already swapped breaks. An early break for Rublev! Sealed with a whipped double-handed backhand. Tsitsipas seems to be uncomfortable already, waggling his knee about and doing some stretches. Is he for real or just reacting to the loss of serve? We\u2019ll be most closely following Tsitsipas-Rublev for the next little while, by the way, while still casting eyes around the other courts. If you\u2019re watching \u2013 or even at! \u2013 one of the other matches then do write in with your thoughts! Fifteen matches are underway \u2013 including this one, as of a moment or two ago! Belinda Bencic, the women\u2019s 15th seed, is a break down already to Mandy Minella. First up on Louis Armstrong will be Stefanos Tsitsipas against Andrey Rublev \u2013 two richly talented 21-year-olds who should serve up a very close first-round tie here. They will be starting pretty soon. Daniela Hantuchova has just compared Gauff\u2019s on-court movement to that of Martina Hingis. That\u2019s some accolade! Do we agree? We could do with that, yes. I\u2019m quietly optimistic for her but don\u2019t want to make bold predictions. She\u2019s certainly got a chance of making a big, big impact. Here\u2019s a very relevant piece by Tumaini Carayol: Kyle Edmund is speaking on the telly: \u201cI\u2019m feeling excited, had a good week\u2019s training, really enjoyed it and feel like I\u2019ve been progressing nicely. What I\u2019ve got right now is the best I\u2019ve had in a while so it\u2019s just about going and seeing what I\u2019ve got out there on the match court. The conditions here suit me well, the balls fly off, I\u2019ve always enjoyed it. I\u2019m confident in terms of belief in myself in my game but I\u2019m a realist, I haven\u2019t won a huge amount of matches but feel I\u2019ve also done a lot of good stuff.\u201d He\u2019s not gone past the second round in any of his last four grand slams \u2013 let\u2019s hope for a revival here. Here\u2019s a scene-setter for Osaka\u2019s big return, courtesy of Bryan Armen Graham \u2013 who\u2019ll be with you later too: Yes, Serena was on sizzling form. Good shout on those other games. Coco Gauff will probably be on at around 9pm UK time. Any thoughts ahead of today\u2019s action? Or based on yesterday\u2019s, for that matter? Send your emails and tweets in to the addresses above. Let\u2019s interact! The fans are pouring into Flushing Meadows. And what a day we have in store! Various big guns get underway in the next few hours and they\u2019ll all do well to dish out the kind of hiding Serena Williams handed Maria Sharapova yesterday. Novak Djokovic had a straightforward time of things too, but what of today\u2019s contenders? At midday local time \u2013 5pm UK time \u2013 we\u2019ll see the women\u2019s champion Naomi Osaka take on the Russian, Anna Blinkova. That\u2019s in Arthur Ashe Stadium and the third match there will see Rafael Nadal, a semi-finalist last year, face the experienced Australian John Millman. Those tussles should bookend the day nicely. We\u2019ll also see Simona Halep against Nicole Gibbs, Sloane Stephens taking on Anna Kalinskaya, Nick Kyrgios playing Steve Johnson and Great Britain\u2019s own Kyle Edmund facing Pablo Andujar. The latter will probably take place around teatime UK time. That\u2019s just some of it; we\u2019ll dig into the rest very soon. Tuesday\u2019s play starts at 4pm UK time",

In a blow for proponents of fish and chips, English takeaways recorded the slowest growth \u2013 less than 1%. Meanwhile average household spending on takeaways has grown to nearly 15% of food expenditure from close to 11% in 2015.</p> <p>Paul Baron, the owner of I Am Doner, a pair of kebab shops in Leeds and Harrogate, said his vegan kebab routinely outsold chicken, halloumi and falafel.

      "bodyText": "They are still a long way from toppling chicken chow mein as the nation\u2019s favourite takeaway, but vegan meals are now the UK\u2019s fastest growing choice, with orders rising almost fivefold over the last two years. Burgers made from black beans, sweet potato and quinoa and vegan \u201cfried chicken\u201d are among the dishes challenging doner kebabs and tikka masala when households cannot be bothered to cook or do not have the time. With 600,000 people believed to be vegan in the UK in 2018, and an increase in \u201cflexitarians\u201d choosing to reduce their consumption of animal products, orders of vegan takeaways grew 388% between 2016 and 2018 while vegetarian orders rose 137%, according to research by the British Takeaway Campaign. Pakistani, Greek, Persian and Turkish takeaways also grew in popularity more rapidly than the nation\u2019s favourites \u2013 Chinese and Indian \u2013 over the last two years, indicating a growing cosmopolitanism in UK appetites. In a blow for proponents of fish and chips, English takeaways recorded the slowest growth \u2013 less than 1%. Meanwhile average household spending on takeaways has grown to nearly 15% of food expenditure from close to 11% in 2015. Paul Baron, the owner of I Am Doner, a pair of kebab shops in Leeds and Harrogate, said his vegan kebab routinely outsold chicken, halloumi and falafel. Made from seitan, a meat substitute derived from wheat gluten, the \u201cvoner\u201d kebab sometimes outsells the lamb alternative too. \u201cDemand increases by the week,\u201d Baron said. \u201cThe vegan crowd comes in all sorts of shapes and sizes. A lot of people are coming in who aren\u2019t vegan.\u201d The online delivery platform Deliveroo reported that vegan orders had quadrupled over the past two years and said that in the last 12 months the number of vegan restaurants on the app increased by 168%, making it one of the fastest-growing categories. Last month the platform\u2019s top-selling vegan dishes were Wagamama\u2019s vegatsu version of katsu curry, Pizza Express\u2019 vegan margarita and the smoky chorizo and cheese burger from Arancini Brothers. In June 2019 the platform recorded its highest number of vegan orders, followed by January 2019, perhaps driven by new year resolutions. \u201cAs people look for healthier and more diverse eating options, they aren\u2019t turning away from takeaways, they are turning towards them,\u201d said Ibrahim Dogus, the chairman of the British Takeaway Campaign. Northern Irish households spend on average \u00a357 a month on takeaways, more than any other part of the UK, while those in the east Midlands spend the least. The research also reveals variations in taste with Scotland\u2019s favourite being an Indian, London preferring Chinese and the north opting mostly for pizza. Mainstream caterers are increasingly targeting vegans and people who want to eat fewer animal products. In January the airline Jet2 introduced a vegan pasta arrabiata in its in-flight service and in April Ryanair added a vegan lasagne. Thomas Cook has a vegan biryani and tagine on its planes. Meanwhile the bakers Greggs announced it was working on vegan versions of all its best-selling products, from steak bakes to pasties and doughnuts, in an attempt to repeat the runaway success of its vegan sausage roll.",

The target is part of the retailer\u2019s sustainable cotton programme, launched in 2013, with the aim to use 100% sustainable cotton in all its product categories. The sustainable cotton is currently being used in women\u2019s pyjamas, a range of denim, towels and bedding, and will be rolled out to menswear and T-shirts next.

The conglomerate has taken a stake in off-grid solar company BBOXX through the start-up\u2019s latest funding round, which will power the Africa-focused company deeper into Asia. The funds will also help BBOXX, which operates in Rwanda, Kenya, Togo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to break into new African markets, where an estimated one in three people live without reliable access to electricity. BBOXX is one of a growing number of energy companies to plug into the demand for energy across Africa and south Asia. The falling cost of solar technology and the strength of mobile banking across Africa have encouraged major investments from global energy companies including US giant General Electric and France\u2019s EDF and Engie. Mansoor Hamayun, BBOXX\u2019s chief executive and co-founder, said Mitsubishi\u2019s \u201cextensive reach\u201d and \u201ctechnological expertise\u201d would help the company to supply more people living without access to modern utilities and services. \u201cThe funding is further evidence of Japanese interest in Africa and in PAYG [pay as you go] solar energy globally,\u201d he said. BBOXX and its rivals use mobile money to charge customers a monthly fee for the use of mini solar panels and ultra-efficient lighting strips.

      "body": "<p>Jeremy Corbyn has backed cross-party plans to delay a vote of no confidence in Boris Johnson and prioritise rebel MPs\u2019 attempts to use legislation to stop a no-deal Brexit, with plans set to be agreed by the end of the week.</p> <p>In a meeting with opposition parties convened by the Labour leader, Corbyn opened the discussion by reassuring MPs that Labour would not seek a premature vote of no confidence that might stymie legislative efforts to stop no deal. But there could yet be a conflict over who should lead the push for legislation to stop a no-deal Brexit.</p> <p>Corbyn said he would \u201cpropose the parliamentary process which would mean the legislation can be laid\u201d, though other opposition MPs have made it clear they believe the moves must be led by backbenchers.</p> <p>Key opposition MPs will convene smaller meetings to discuss plans for legislation over the next 48 hours and party leaders hope to speak again by the end of the week, according to sources.</p> <p>MPs\u2019 efforts were given a fresh sense urgency on Tuesday evening as rumours swirled at Westminster that the privy council of senior ministers was preparing to meet the Queen at Balmoral this week, perhaps as soon as Wednesday.</p> <p>Leaked emails revealed at the weekend that the prime minister had sought legal advice about proroguing parliament for five weeks from early September, when MPs are already due to break briefly for party conferences.</p> <p>A new session of parliament would then begin with a fresh Queen\u2019s speech packed with manifesto-friendly measures on or around 14 October.</p> <p>Such a move would have to be approved by the privy council.

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn has backed cross-party plans to delay a vote of no confidence in Boris Johnson and prioritise rebel MPs\u2019 attempts to use legislation to stop a no-deal Brexit, with plans set to be agreed by the end of the week. In a meeting with opposition parties convened by the Labour leader, Corbyn opened the discussion by reassuring MPs that Labour would not seek a premature vote of no confidence that might stymie legislative efforts to stop no deal. But there could yet be a conflict over who should lead the push for legislation to stop a no-deal Brexit. Corbyn said he would \u201cpropose the parliamentary process which would mean the legislation can be laid\u201d, though other opposition MPs have made it clear they believe the moves must be led by backbenchers. Key opposition MPs will convene smaller meetings to discuss plans for legislation over the next 48 hours and party leaders hope to speak again by the end of the week, according to sources. MPs\u2019 efforts were given a fresh sense urgency on Tuesday evening as rumours swirled at Westminster that the privy council of senior ministers was preparing to meet the Queen at Balmoral this week, perhaps as soon as Wednesday. Leaked emails revealed at the weekend that the prime minister had sought legal advice about proroguing parliament for five weeks from early September, when MPs are already due to break briefly for party conferences. A new session of parliament would then begin with a fresh Queen\u2019s speech packed with manifesto-friendly measures on or around 14 October. Such a move would have to be approved by the privy council. It would give MPs little chance for parliamentary manoeuvring, but could just about allow time for a vote on any reworked deal Johnson manages to strike with the EU27, before the crucial European council meeting on October 17. One source suggested something like this timetable could be on the agenda at the privy council meeting. Speculation that Johnson could call an early general election was also heightened on Tuesday when the Treasury abruptly cancelled a major speech by the chancellor, Sajid Javid. Instead, the Treasury announced that the one-year spending review, setting out the government\u2019s economic priorities, is to be fast-tracked to 4 September \u2013 the day MPs return to parliament \u2013 in a sign that the government wants to highlight a new policy agenda before a potential autumn election. An agreement to focus efforts on passing legislation to stop a no-deal Brexit was made at Tuesday\u2019s meeting, attended by the Scottish National party\u2019s Ian Blackford, Jo Swinson of the Liberal Democrats, the Green party\u2019s Caroline Lucas, Plaid Cymru\u2019s Adam Price and Liz Saville Roberts and the Independent Group for Change\u2019s Anna Soubry. Speaking after the meeting, Corbyn said he would \u201cput forward a proposal which will make sure that parliament is able to debate a legislative way of preventing the government crashing us out with no deal \u2026 the legislation will be laid by people from all of the opposition parties and will be supported by some Conservative MPs as well.\u201d MPs are planning on using the same tactics as they did earlier this year when rebels seized control of the order paper and passed a bill led by Yvette Cooper and Oliver Letwin that mandated an extension to article 50. Moves are also planned to force the publication of damaging no-deal preparation documents to win public backing for efforts to prevent a no-deal departure, as well as other parliamentary manoeuvres to try to block any proposed prorogation of parliament. Parties also discussed opposing holding the regular parliamentary recess over the party conference period in late September, though a Labour source said nothing had been agreed. In a joint statement published by Labour after the meeting, which appeared to retreat from the party\u2019s initial offer to call a vote of no confidence and establish a caretaker government led by Corbyn, the party leaders said they \u201cagreed on the urgency to act together to find practical ways to prevent no deal, including the possibility of passing legislation and a vote of no confidence\u201d. The Labour leader insisted later that the option of a motion of no confidence remained on the table and could be explored simultaneously. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing to do with whether people like me or not,\u201d he said. \u201cThe priority is to ensure we don\u2019t crash out of the EU. And we will put a motion of no confidence at a time of our choosing.\u201d Although Letwin, Dominic Grieve, and Caroline Spelman, all prominent Conservatives opposed to Brexit, were invited to the meeting, no Tory MPs attended. Corbyn had made an offer to opposition MPs that he would lead a caretaker government for a short period to negotiate an extension to article 50 and then call an immediate general election in which Labour would campaign on a platform of offering a second referendum. This has been rejected by the vast majority of Conservatives, as well as the Lib Dems. Rebel Conservatives and former Tories including Nick Boles, some of whom have been key movers in efforts to stop no deal, have insisted parliamentary legislation should be the focus. It is understood Soubry, a former Conservative MP, made a forceful case that legislation had to be a priority. Boles had said he was deeply concerned that Corbyn would attempt to trigger a no-confidence vote too early and wrote to the Labour leader urging him to \u201cdeclare publicly that you will not facilitate an election before an extension of article 50 has been secured and a no-deal Brexit has been averted\u201d. After the meeting, Corbyn wrote to 116 backbench Conservative and independent MPs including Theresa May, Philip Hammond, David Lidington and Greg Clark, urging them to back the cross-party efforts against no deal. Labour said it had highlighted MPs who had voted against no deal on 27 March when voting for an extension to article 50. \u201cWe know there is a majority in parliament against no deal,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI am writing to you to offer to work together, in a collegiate, cross-party spirit, to find a practical way to prevent no deal.\u201d Soubry said there was \u201cno debate\u201d that the legislative route was the best way forward. \u201cA vote of no confidence is absolutely the last resort.

Victimisation, fundamental conflict between the west and Islam, anti-establishment sentiment and the justification of violence were all found in social media statements by the four UK groups and in statements by Breivik.</p> <p>Generation Identity and the BNP shared identical world views with Breivik on the theme of victimisation, including ideas of \u201cwhite genocide\u201d and \u201cthe great replacement\u201d theory.</p> <p>The security services and the government have recognised the threat of violent and non-violent far-right extremism in the UK. MI5 took over the matter from police in 2018, meaning the far right was officially designated as a major national security threat.</p> <p>In 2016, the neo-Nazi group National Action became the first far-right group to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/12/neo-nazi-group-national-action-banned-by-uk-home-secretary\">proscribed in the UK</a>. Announcing the decision, the then home secretary, Amber Rudd, said the group was a \u201cracist, antisemitic and homophobic organisation which stirs up hatred, glorifies violence and promotes a vile ideology\u201d.</p> <p>The ban, which covers three National Action splinter groups, has resulted in several former members being put on trial. To date, National Action is the only far-right group outlawed in the UK.</p> <p>The Tony Blair Institute has called for a working definition of extremism, which could be used as a tool by government, law enforcement and institutions to tackle individuals and groups that spread hateful ideas but fall short of advocating violence.</p> <p>It is also calling for further efforts to curb far-right hate online, including working with social media companies to define the limits of acceptable content.</p> <p>Azmina Siddique, a policy adviser at the institute, said: \u201cThese groups are far from innocuous. Only <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MikeStuchbery_/status/1150815989283676160\">last month</a>, Generation Identity England activists gathered outside the Tower of London dressed as Isis militants and simulated the beheading of two anti-racism activists. It is time that policymakers acted \u2013 by defining extremism and designating hateful groups \u2013 to stop such obviously malicious acts.\u201d</p> <p>Lady Williams, the minister for countering extremism, said: \u201cFar-right extremism has absolutely no place in our society. Our counter-terrorism and counter-extremism strategies tackle the scourge of both violent and nonviolent far-right extremism head on.</p> <p>\u201cWe have also established the independent commission for countering extremism, which provides advice in what is needed to tackle extremism and will be refreshing our counter-extremism strategy to ensure we keep pace with the evolving threat.\u201d <br></p>",

      "bodyText": "A new law allowing for hate groups to be designated and punished before they turn to violence is needed in order to tackle far-right extremists, according to a report by Tony Blair\u2019s thinktank, which also seeks powers to ban marches and media appearances. Generation Identity, a racist movement that promotes a conspiracy theory that white people are being replaced by non-whites in Europe, would be among the groups targeted by new legislation, the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change report said. The law could sit alongside proscription powers, banning groups concerned with terrorism, but would not be directly linked to violence or terrorism. Rather, it would designate hate groups as organisations that spread intolerance and antipathy towards people of a different race, religion, gender or nationality, the report said. Offences related to designation as a hate group should be treated as civil, not criminal, the thinktank recommends. The authors acknowledge that the issue of linking violent and nonviolent extremism is contentious and steps would need to be taken to protect free speech. The recommendations and conclusions are based on analysis of the overlap between four \u201cnonviolent\u201d far-right groups \u2013 Britain First, For Britain, the British National party (BNP) and Generation Identity England \u2013 and the ideology of the terrorist Anders Breivik, who murdered 77 people in Norway in 2011. Writing in a foreword, the former home secretary Jacqui Smith, the chair of the Jo Cox Foundation, said: \u201cThe growth of far-right extremist groups and the threat they pose cannot be left on the \u2018too difficult\u2019 pile. \u201cWhile ad hoc action has been taken against some groups and the intelligence services are now prioritising the monitoring of far-right terrorists, we need to return to the vexed problem of how to identify the link between violent and nonviolent extremism, and develop a coherent policy approach to tackling the threat of far-right groups.\u201d The government, public agencies and security services have taken steps to tackle far-right violence, but action against nonviolent activity has been limited and uncoordinated. In its report, Narratives of Hate: The Spectrum of Far-Right Worldviews in the UK, the thinktank found that public messages from the four activist groups in the UK had shared themes with the world view of Breivik. Victimisation, fundamental conflict between the west and Islam, anti-establishment sentiment and the justification of violence were all found in social media statements by the four UK groups and in statements by Breivik. Generation Identity and the BNP shared identical world views with Breivik on the theme of victimisation, including ideas of \u201cwhite genocide\u201d and \u201cthe great replacement\u201d theory. The security services and the government have recognised the threat of violent and non-violent far-right extremism in the UK. MI5 took over the matter from police in 2018, meaning the far right was officially designated as a major national security threat. In 2016, the neo-Nazi group National Action became the first far-right group to be proscribed in the UK. Announcing the decision, the then home secretary, Amber Rudd, said the group was a \u201cracist, antisemitic and homophobic organisation which stirs up hatred, glorifies violence and promotes a vile ideology\u201d. The ban, which covers three National Action splinter groups, has resulted in several former members being put on trial. To date, National Action is the only far-right group outlawed in the UK. The Tony Blair Institute has called for a working definition of extremism, which could be used as a tool by government, law enforcement and institutions to tackle individuals and groups that spread hateful ideas but fall short of advocating violence. It is also calling for further efforts to curb far-right hate online, including working with social media companies to define the limits of acceptable content. Azmina Siddique, a policy adviser at the institute, said: \u201cThese groups are far from innocuous. Only last month, Generation Identity England activists gathered outside the Tower of London dressed as Isis militants and simulated the beheading of two anti-racism activists. It is time that policymakers acted \u2013 by defining extremism and designating hateful groups \u2013 to stop such obviously malicious acts.\u201d Lady Williams, the minister for countering extremism, said: \u201cFar-right extremism has absolutely no place in our society. Our counter-terrorism and counter-extremism strategies tackle the scourge of both violent and nonviolent far-right extremism head on. \u201cWe have also established the independent commission for countering extremism, which provides advice in what is needed to tackle extremism and will be refreshing our counter-extremism strategy to ensure we keep pace with the evolving threat.\u201d",

Top stories An expert panel has warned ministers that the controversial scientist Peter Ridd is misrepresenting robust science about the plight of the Great Barrier Reef, and compared his claims to the strategy used by the tobacco industry to raise doubt about the impact of smoking. The warning, in a letter to the federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, and the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, follows Ridd launching a lecture tour in which he has repeated his claim that farmland pollution does not significantly damage the natural wonder. Jeffrey Epstein was called a coward and a \u201cdepraved human being\u201d in a New York courtroom on Tuesday by women who accused him of sexually abusing them as teens. At a special hearing in Manhattan, alleged victims of the disgraced financier \u2013 whose political and royal connections have come under fresh scrutiny since his arrest in New York, and who killed himself in a New York jail this month \u2013 were able to give voice to their anguish. About 20 spoke in Manhattan federal court. References to wealth inequality reaching its peak in 2017-18 were removed from an Australian Bureau of Statistics press release to help craft a \u201cgood media story\u201d, according to internal documents.

CEOs claim Joe Biden\u2019s brother promised them the 2020 candidate would help their companies. James Biden is facing renewed claims that he lured potential business associates with promises his brother could be influenced to adopt their business model. British MPs have pledged to form alternative parliament in case of prorogation, at a cross-party meeting where Boris Johnson was described as a threat to the \u201cvery nature\u201d of British democracy.

Preston have prevailed at Deepdale in their all Championship tie against Hull City. REDEMPTION!!! KIND OF!!! After a rough couple of weeks, Jack Butland takes and scores Stoke\u2019s final penalty, before Leeds hit the post with their final effort. Stoke go through! Crystal Palace are out!!! Andros Townsend missed the Premier League\u2019s first penalty against Colchester United and the League Two side went on to win the shoot-out 5-4. Bury latest: As the penalty shoot-outs to decide the four drawn ties go on, here\u2019s David Conn with the latest on the disaster that has befallen Bury today. He reveals that the appalling state of the club\u2019s finances led to the modern and analytical potential buyers pulling abruptly out of the deal to buy and save the club. Read on ... Full time: Crawley 1-0 Norwich City For just the second time in their history, go into the third round of the League Cup after knocking out Norwich City from the Premier League. It is a measure of just how seriously Norwich were taking this competition that Daniel Farke made 11 changes from the side that lost against Chelsea on Saturday. He won\u2019t be bothered about going out of this competition, but hats off to Gabriele Cioffi\u2019s League Two side, who could only beat the team that lined up against them.

Plymouth 2-4 Reading: With Plymouth pushing forward looking for an equaliser, Reading attack on the break and Yakou Meite scores his second in four minutes to win the tie for Reading. Bristol Rovers 1-2 Brighton: Glenn Murray sweeps home from the edge of the six-yard box to give Brighton a late lead. Plymouth 2-3 Reading: A Yakou Meite penalty in the 87th minute puts Reading ahead and means we may not need penalties at Home Park. Oxford 1-2 Millwall: Mark Sykes keeps Oxford United in with a shout against Millwall with three minutes to go. Crewe 1-6 Aston Villa: Stop it, Jack Grealish. They\u2019re already dead!

Josh Barrett has just scored his second for Reading - an absolute purler from distance into the top corner, while Liam Boyce has wrapped up his hat-trick for Burton Albion against Morecambe. Leeds United 1-2 Stoke City: Currently enduring the worst spell of his career, the Jack Butland horror show continues. Having been dropped from the Stoke side that lost against the same opposition in the Championship on Saturday after a string of poor performances, the Stoke goalkeeper is recalled tonight only to make rather a mess of a clearance and Leeds capitalise through Eddie Nketiah. Carabao Cup second round latest Bristol Rovers 1-1 Brighton Burton Albion 3-0 Morecambe Cardiff City 0-2 Luton Town Crawley Town 1-0 Norwich City Crewe Alexandra 0-3 Aston Villa Crystal Palace 0-0 Colchester United Fulham 0-1 Southampton Grimsby Town 0-0 Macclesfield (match abandoned at HT) Leeds United 1-2 Stoke City Newport County 0-2 West Ham Nottingham Forest 2-0 Derby County Oxford United 0-2 Millwall Plymouth Argyle 2-1 Reading Preston 2-1 Hull City Rochdale 2-0 Carlisle United Sheffield United 2-0 Blackburn Rovers Southend United 0-2 MK Dons Watford 2-0 Coventry City Bristol Rovers 1-1 Brighton: Tom Nichols equalises for the Gas against Brighton in the 64th minute. Cardiff City 0-2 Luton Town: Alan Sheehan turns the screw on Cardiff City in this all Championship tie. Cardiff City 0-2 West Ham: Pablo Fornals scores his first goal for West Ham. A low cross evades several players as it trundles across the edge of the six yard box and he pokes home. They all count! Grimsby v Macclesfield: The tie has been abandoned after a pitch inspection with the tie scoreless. There was torrential rain in the first half and after waiting 10 minutes after the second half was due to kick off, the referee has called it off because the pitch is waterlogged. Plymouth 2-1 Reading: Former Everton starlet Jose Baxter, puts Plymouth back in front against Reading at Home Park with a shot from outside the penalty area. Fulham 0-1 Southampton: Republic of Ireland international Michael Obafemi puts his side ahead at Craven Cottage. Watford 2-0 Coventry City: Some much-needed respite for beleaguered Watford manager looks very much ahoy, as Daryl Janmaat doubles Watford\u2019s lead. Southend 1-1 MK Dons: Not content with having a name out of the top drawer, Brandon Goodship equalises for Southend at Roots Hall. Oxford United 0-2 Millwall: Jon Dadi Bodvarsson scores his second of the game to edge Millwall closer to the third round. Bristol Rovers 0-1 Brighton: Aaron Connolly scores from close range after a shot from distance took a lucky deflection into his path. Burton 3-0 Morecambe: Ryan Edwards scores his first goal for Burton to give them what looks like an unassailable lead against Morecambe. Bristol Rovers 0-0 Brighton Burton Albion 2-0 Morecambe Cardiff City 0-1 Luton Town Crawley Town 1-0 Norwich City Crewe Alexandra 0-3 Aston Villa Crystal Palace 0-0 Colchester United Fulham 0-0 Southampton Grimsby Town 0-0 Macclesfield Town Leeds United 0-2 Stoke City Newport County 0-1 West Ham Nottingham Forest 2-0 Derby County Oxford United 0-1 Millwall Plymouth Argyle 1-1 Reading Preston 2-1 Hull City Rochdale 2-0 Carlisle United Sheffield United 2-0 Blackburn Rovers Southend United 0-2 MK Dons Watford 1-0 Coventry City Sheffield United 2-0 Blackburn Rovers: Oliver Norwood puts Sheffield United 2-0 up, capitalising on an excellent assist from Ravel Morrison. Crewe 0-3 Aston Villa: Conor Hourihane heads home his second of the night to put the tie beyond Crewe of League Two. Burton 2-0 Morecambe: Liam Boyce scores his second of the night in one of the more glamourous ties of the evening. Cardiff 0-1 Luton Town: Luton lead through a Junior Hoilett own goal. Newport County 0-1 West Ham: Jack Wilshere scores his first goal since January 2018, capitalising on a defensive blunder to score a nice individual goal. Leeds 0-2 Stoke City: Sam Vokes fires home, getting on the end of a pull-back from the byline after good work from Tyrese Campbell. Leeds 0-1 Stoke City: Stoke City manager Nathan Jones is a man under pressure after a dreadful start to the season, but has Danny Bath to thank for putting his side ahead tonight. Southend 0-2 MK Dons: Callum Brittain spanks one into the top corner to double MK Dons\u2019 lead at Southend. Still without a point in League One, the Shrimpers will probably see elimination from this competition as a merciful release. Watford 1-0 Coventry: Ismaila Sarr takes advantage of some atrocious marking to latch on to a wonderful through ball from Isaac Success and fire into the bottom into the bottom left-hand corner. Rochdale 2-0 Carlisle: Matt Done doubles Rochdale\u2019s lead against Carlisle. Burton 1-0 Morecambe: Liam Boyce opens the scoring at the Pirelli Stadium Princess Way. Southend 0-1 MK Dons: Rhys Healey has done a goal. Plymouth 1-1 Reading: Josh Barrett scores from a tight angle to equalise for Reading. Preston 2-1 Hull City: Norn Iron international Josh Magennis scores from the spot to get Hull back into this all Championship tie. Nottingham Forest 2-0 Derby: Joe Lolley heads past Ben Hamer after attacking Albert Adomah\u2019s cross from the left. More on Bury ... Sheffield United 1-0 Blackburn: Having given away a penalty from which Blackburn failed to score, Richard Stearman gives his side the lead with a diving header. Oxford 0-1 Millwall: Jon Dadi Bodvarsson scores his first goal for Millwall since signing from Reading in the summer. He fires a low drive into the bottom corner after a jinking run. Preston 2-0 Hull City: Josh Harrop reacts quickest to prod the ball into an empty net after latching on to a rebound from Hull City goalkeeper Matt Ingram Nottingham Forest 1-0 Derby County: Albert Adomah stabs the ball home at the far post. Joe Lolley stroked the ball into the penalty area from a corner, it was flicked towards Adomah and he made no mistake. Crewe 0-2 Aston Villa: Having had a goal disallowed, Crewe now go two behind, after Conor Hourihane slots home on 24 minutes. Plymouth 1-0 Reading: Ryan Taylor scores a scrappy opener to put his League Two side one up against Championship opposition. Preston 1-0 Hull City: Paul Huntington gets above his mind to get on the end of a Josh Harrop free-kick and head his side in front at Deepdale. Crawley Town 1-0 Norwich City: League Two side Crawley have gone ahead against Norwich City, with Beryly Lubula putting them ahead after 17 minutes. Norwich manager Daniel Farke has rotated his squad, fielding an entirely different team to that that which was beaten by Chelsea at the weekend. Bury latest: The Guardian\u2019s North of England correspondent Josh Halliday has spent much of today at Gigg Lane, where Bury\u2019s league membership and very existence looks in grave doubt. Here\u2019s his take, along with the latest on some late new bids. Carabao Cup - second round latest After 15 minutes of action, the goals are just flying in on a hi-octane white-knuckle ride of League Cup action. Bristol Rovers 0-0 Brighton Burton Albion 0-0 Morecambe Cardiff City 0-0 Luton Town Crawley Town 0-0 Norwich City Crewe Alexandra 0-1 Aston Villa Crystal Palace 0-0 Colchester United Fulham 0-0 Southampton Grimsby Town 0-0 Macclesfield Town Leeds United 0-0 Stoke City Newport County 0-0 West Ham Nottingham Forest 0-0 Derby County Oxford United 0-0 Millwall Plymouth Argyle 0-0 Reading Preston 0-0 Hull City Rochdale 1-0 Carlisle United Sheffield United 0-0 Blackburn Rovers Southend United 0-0 MK Dons Watford 0-0 Coventry City Rochdale 1-0 Carlisle: Aaron Morley gives the League One side the lead over Carlisle from a division below at Spotland. Sheffield United 0-0 Blackburn: Blackburn miss a penalty, with Adam Armstrong having his effort saved by Simon Moore after Bradley Dack was brought down in the box by Richard Stearman. Fulham 0-0 Southampton: Fulham have gone close with a free-kick from outside the area, with Stefan Johansen rattling the cross-bar. Crewe 0-1 Aston Villa: Ezri Konza has just headed Aston Villa in front from close range at Crewe, after the home side failed to clear a corner properly. Peeeeep! The first whistles of tonight\u2019s 18 ties are blown and games the length and breadth of England and Wales kick off. A quick reminder \u2013 if any of tonight\u2019s ties end up level after 90 minutes, they\u2019ll go straight to penalties. Extra time has been scrapped and for that we should all be grateful.

More on that as we get it. Watford v Coventry City: Watford hand first starts to Danny Welbeck and Ismaila Sarr. League One side Coventry make six changes with Callum O\u2019Hare, Gervane Kastaneer and Josh Eccles earning their first starts of the season. Newport County v West Ham: While he isn\u2019t a member of their squad, former Manchester City and Swansea striker Wilfried Bony has been training with the League Two side in a bid to keep himself in shape as he looks for a new club. Newport manager Mike Flynn has been singing the Ivorian\u2019s praises. It\u2019s the first of two nights of Carabao Cup second round action and we\u2019ve 18 matches to stay across tonight. Newport County v West Ham is being televised live on Sky Sports, while Nottingham Forest v Derby County and \u2013 according to the competition\u2019s official website \u2013 Crystal Palace v Colchester United are among the pick of the other \u201cfascinating fixtures\u201d. We\u2019ll keep you up to speed on what\u2019s going on, while also monitoring the goings-on, or lack of them, at Bury FC and Bolton Wanderers. Both clubs have been plunged into crisis and are on the brink of expulsion from the league run by the organisers of this Cup competition. It\u2019s been a busy day at EFL HQ, where it seems the promotion of this competition has long been more of a priority than preventing the kind of poor ownership that leads to member clubs teetering on the brink of oblivion.",

      "bodyText": "More bakers, longer running time, but also ruder than ever. Entertainment richer than a simnel cake, possibly. They\u2019re all big personalities this year, with faces more malleable than A Muppet\u2019s Christmas Carol but capable too. Thanks for the company, y\u2019all. You called it right: the hipster always goes week one. The bun is done. Priya with her Crayola Guttenberg Press has gone down well with everyone. But Michelle walked away with the honours, and made it look easy. A piece of pi bara brith. What am I talking about, she was stressed out the entire time. How will she handle the pressure of, er, week two of a possibly fifty? See you then, baking bredren! In the meantime, come say hello on twitter or Instagram or if you want to make me really happy* buy my book * a highly relative term Oh, only one person goes. Does this mean the show will be an extra week long? It already feels an extra week long. Is it ten to midnight Dan is going home! The bun is no longer current. I had no eye deer this would go so badly for him The Fleabag is redeemed! I am surprised and delighted for her. Okay Jamie and Dan gone? WIll they get a middle aged woman in to replace them? Like Love Island, but...not Thanks @DaveDave69. I think I actually meant Robert Winston but couldn\u2019t remember his name Everyone\u2019s talking about Jamie. Unfortunately you\u2019re all saying he\u2019s going home I see Dan\u2019s dry ice butters no parsnips for you people. Tough crowd. No Jamie! Show your tears. Be a new kind of man. It will not affect your modelling contract, I promise you. Did Dan just say \u201cThrow me a bun\u201d Jamie actually enters puberty before our eyes, voice breaking as he presents his cake to Paul like a tribal initiation. What a privilege to see. Like an Attenborough documentary. DAN BUN HAS A DRY ICE ELEMENT. How do you like him now? Steph\u2019s ice cream crumbles, like all childhood dreams. But David has possibly inched the top spot with his creepy snakes on a cake. Has he redeemed himself from that carrot fat malarkey for you all? There\u2019s a\u2026droop to Phil\u2019s pocket rocket which lets him down. Henry\u2019s blackberry redeems a too sweet if stunning effort. The crown looked to be his before that I think, but has he done enough? Michelle\u2019s toadstool is a Proustian delight. Helena\u2019s garden is an emerald dream. Alice\u2019s sweetshop resides in a \u201crough and ready\u201d part of town. I\u2019ve noticed that when Noel makes a suggestive joke about something Prue says, she kind of says it again, as if that will clarify what she meant. Like someone who doesn\u2019t understand what the class joker is up to, or which defensive weapons to deploy @lovejonsnow yes me too. Like he\u2019s being spied on by a ninja buck from behind a hedge of chest hair. Phil...smoothing his rocket tip is a late contender for the episode\u2019s most suggestive moment. Coming after Furry Garden Gate, that\u2019s saying something Who does Rosie\u2019s voice remind me of? Heavy handed tablet slam from Dan there. Michael\u2019s dropped his cake and given himself \u201ca stress hernia.\u201d This has entered my top ten lexicon of anxiety catchphrases with a bullet. LOOK AT MICHAEL\u2019S BLUE HAND Priya with her ISBN geekery was already my favourite and then she said \u201cWhat is that timer for?\u201d LOVE. \u201cI\u2019ve done about 20 minutes work.\u201d Personally I couldn\u2019t love Jamie more. Especially standing next to Alice making the Sistine Chapel Still not over furry garden to be honest Alice is making an entire cake shop. Incredible. All Alices are high achievers aren\u2019t they? Though as someone has pointed out, they all seem very high achieving this year. I feel 30% worse about myself. @scarletpanda \u2018ISBN geekery\u2019 is my niche search term when I go online incognito @sweetiepudding Paul\u2019s relative orangery IS somewhat reduced, I think you\u2019re right. He\u2019s been...unTangoed? @GreatIsMyNewt I was in Edinburgh botanical garden yesterday and found a chilli plant called \u2018Peter\u2019s Penis\u2019. Single Entendre City. I respected it. Okay, who do we like for this? (Interpret the question however you see fit.) 20yr old Jamie has forgotten to add eggs to his cake. I\u2019m going to miss these almost literally schoolboy errors. Paul just staring at Henry. Like a frozen video that will never buffer. Huge, relatable lols at Priya writing an ISBN number on the childhood storybook she made from crayon. Steph\u2019s dropped ice cream cake is conceptually brilliant I think? All about the redemption of childhood dreams. \u201cHow big is your fairy garden?\u201d The man is shattering her innocence before our eyes. NB when Paul said \u201cOh you mean fairy garden\u201d he ALSO pronounced it Furry Garden, because of HIS accent. What IS going on. WHAAAT!?! Paul mistakes Helena\u2019s fairy garden for her \u2018furry garden\u2019 and no doubt the switchboards lit up. How any of this cake is going to be eaten when everyone\u2019s jaws are on the floor, is beyond me. @gazoomplasm I slowed down when I tried to figure out how to put pictures on the blog, and apparently I\u2019ve forgotten. Little glimpse behind the golden curtain there Jamie comes in last and says thank you. I love him. He\u2019s followed by Helena\u2019s blood red middle. Steph comes in third, Rosie second, and head boy Henry takes the prize! \u2018Very Good Feathering and Excellent in Every Way\u2019 is his house motto isn\u2019t it Michelle and Michael clasping each other\u2019s arms is a sweeter sight than Phil\u2019s sponge, which is saying something. The man is an artist. Jamie has only made two layers; but on the other hand they are both texturally awful. Apparently they taste not bad though? The confuser. Paul complains about dropping his rubber on the floor- no, that joke needs finesse. Let\u2019s just say many bakers have struggled to get their rise on I see Dan\u2019s bun has put a LOT of you off. I wonder if he keeps a money jar in it like Marge Simpson. @paperview \u2018Twin but dim\u2019 is so good I had to leave the room. Which is the only thing I\u2019m not allowed to do \u2018Ice and slice\u2019 is Henry\u2019s order of sponge prep. I bet that\u2019s how he orders his g&amp;t too. Jamie is making a two layer cake. I love an underdog, Maybe they\u2019ll be the best two layers. Dan Bun thinks the instructions look clear. He\u2019s only on step one. A perfect expression of the misguided energy of youth. You like a bit of cruelty\u201d observes Prue, and Paul\u2019s collar nods sternly. This is absolutely one of those cakes that I only imagine being made in a factory and sent directly to the corner shop. Alice\u2019s ginger wreath is glorious but unbalanced. Bad Hand Harry\u2019s henna cake brings the magic, but Dan Bun\u2019s rum and raw number breaks the spell. They\u2019re good though, aren\u2019t they. RUSTICAAA \u201cI think it looks attractive. Good colour.\u201d Paul Hollywood, not helping. Michelle has been given an asymmetric haircut she doesn\u2019t like and does not want you to be kind about it Helena has broken the mould with an unintentionally savoury cake that looks like a tail-light shattered above it. Modify my vows, Gregory PHIL! That looks magnificent. I have misjudged you, and lessons should be taken from this. (Possibly won\u2019t be.) But it tastes good! Daub yourself in Pictich dye, you conquering hero! Henry\u2019s Operah House now looks the ruin of a Druidic shrine, bless his brogues Priya nails it, and in the process teaches me that fruitcake is not at all what I was thinking of, and I actually like the look of whatever she\u2019s made. https://twitter.com/Jaiiskii/status/1166428343467724801 @neko99 For some reason I\u2019m drawing a blank on what simnel cake actually is but I know I want it too. It sounds noble. Like a Roman orator. Henry has DROPPED the Royal Opera House and collapsed its walls. That\u2019s gonna take a chunk out of the student loan. Alice looked even more dismayed than him, bless her. Okay Michael is Harry Potter isn\u2019t he. But when he can\u2019t get his wand to work and the magic goes backwards Who is stressing you out the most so far, everyone? Henry is a university prospectus come to life WHO is the is beautiful goth woman and her wolf trying to SPOOKIFY A FRUITCAKE. Draw up my marriage vows, Gregory. I intend to wife I wonder how long before \u2018Jamie and his Samey\u2019 fan fiction starts doing the rounds Identical Twin Klaxon! Why do we have this klaxon, identical twin contestants very rarely happens. What a waste of money. OMG Priya has made marzipan fruit miniatures- the greatest of all art forms- and the banana has authentic browning. I don\u2019t need a mnemonic, because she is my monarch. @Aratan not only is that no help, I feel I now know less than before Should I learn Phil\u2019s name? I suspect he won\u2019t be around for long. Is that mean? He made a joke about his overbearing wife, so I feel karma gives me a pass on this one Michaelangelo\u2019s David Did he say he\u2019s replacing fat with carrot? THAT\u2019S A FAT NO Ooh David\u2019s quite\u2026dishy isn\u2019t he? It\u2019s fine to objectify if you make a pun Man Bun! Dan Bun. Actually Michael has already cut himself and been bandaged up so many times he\u2019ll be knocking his out with a hand looking like King Tut. Money\u2019s back on the horse doctor Okay here\u2019s competition straight off the bat. Michael is ALSO making a chai cake, but whereas Dogbelly is going for taste over looks, Michael has put thought into the cake\u2019s appearance too. It looks good from the sketch. Interesting to see how this\u2026pans out. (IMPORTANT: She is a vet) Rosie\u2026Hmm. Like a dog\u2019s rosy belly is an indicator of bacterial infection? Rosie\u2019s chai cake sounds right up my street, to be honest. Steph looks a lot like she was in an early eighties post-punk band but then settled down and now presents a local radio show. She Stephinately could have been in the Pretenders. That doesn\u2019t help me remember the name Michelle though. Smallholding alert! Michelle is Welsh...and looks like Sian Clifford from Fleabag. The rugged Cliffs and Fords of the Welsh coastline? This is more for my benefit than yours, so bear with \u201cI\u2019m in a tizz already.\u201d Is that\u2026Fleabag\u2019s sister? She is making heavy fruit cake, which is...amelia average supermodel would refuse to eat? Okay help me remember these names. Amelia has pink tips to her hair and is a fashion designer. Which one is fruitcake? Is Christmas cake a variant of fruitcake, or its own thing? Is fruitcake the one that is denser than the core of a neutron star? Breaks your tiles if you drop it? I don\u2019t like fruitcake. Sandi telling everyone it\u2019s nice to see them looking so relaxed is SUCH an unsettling psychological power play. Big deputy head energy. I\u2019m not a high achiever\u2026I have achieved a hangover.\u201d Some guy whose name I don\u2019t know, and is already my hero. (Maybe they\u2019ll be making blondies.) Did you see the size of Paul\u2019s collar in that coat? I am VIBRATING with off-colour jokes about the war. For god\u2019s sake let\u2019s get on with the baking. Also, Noel really can carry off any look, can\u2019t he? Truly a fashion god. Even his face looks like a coat hanger. Nice tenth anniversary winner\u2019s montage. They get such lovely people on this show don\u2019t they. It\u2019s like a vial of anti-venom for The Apprentice Wizard of Oz intro! Guess we can stop worrying about whether the show will have lost its camp appeal. Bonus marks for the QI mention too. Dorothy, meet synergy. Hope you get along. Here we go! Good luck everyone Thanks @GreatIsMyNewt! I\u2019ll answer to Rhine. I\u2019ll answer to Rhino. I draw the line at Rhingo Starr Oh I forgot about the bingo. What shall we have? anything being rudimentary or rustic single entendres of any stripe Noel morphing into the Childcatcher bottoms that sog self-doubt Will the theme tune be replaced by Billie Eilish? Will Paul spend the full hour looking at Tik Tok? Do I have enough youth culture references to fulfill the rule of three? Lovely to see you too Heyerette. You\u2019re not getting old\u2013 everyone\u2019s talking about how young the contestants are this year, and what it might mean tonally... Tanthalus- An hour and a HALF? No one told me. I am going to be palpably older when this done. Mmm, palp The Heat Is On. The Bake Is Off. What does that even mean? No time. Let\u2019s go. Hello cherubs, Welcome to the ONLY Great British Bake Off liveblog available online [if you round down] and certainly the best [citation pending]. Here\u2019s how it works. Every week we\u2019ll watch the show together, and I\u2019ll write up the best bits in real time. Then you can all furiously disagree with my judgment below the line. It\u2019s what the internet was made for. Once again, I feel like GBBO has been sent to save us. The world is \u2013 in parts literally \u2013 on fire. Let\u2019s unite again, over good people in mild peril. Will Prue\u2019s necklace be bigger than her head? Will Paul have been instructed to dim his smoulder? Most importantly, do you all have snacks to hand? I\u2019ve got sponge fingers, the medical condition livebloggers dread. The show starts at 8pm on Channel 4, so I\u2019ll see you back here then!",

An art collector, Lachlan Astle, shrugged when asked what he thought of Hawke\u2019s life being auctioned off: \u201cIt\u2019s her stuff.\u201d Astle was there to bid for a Trobriand Islands splashboard, which he secured for $750. \u201cI thought he was basically the best prime minister we had but I don\u2019t need to have a piece of Bob,\u201d he said. Outside, Astle gossiped with an auction employee about some of the wilder bidding. A Hugh Sawrey painting that hung in Hawke\u2019s office sold for $23,000 off a reserve of between $8,000 and $12,000. Immediately afterwards, Euan Macleod\u2019s Lone Figure in Gully reached only $11,000, despite being expected to fetch as much as $18,000. A nearby gallery had purchased the Macleod, she revealed. \u201cSo they can sell it, you know \u2013 so smart, they got such a good deal.\u201d But the lounges (plural, there were many lounges), furniture and paintings did not tell the whole story. Australians did \u2013 do \u2013 love Hawke, of course, and beyond the collectors and bargain hunters the greatest demand was for the things Australia\u2019s 23rd prime minister might himself have cared about. An inscribed mahogany chess box sold for $5,000. A silver-footed bowl presented to him by the then US Secretary of State Dick Cheney attracted $7,500. Two small silver dishes decorated with frogs sold for $22,000. How else to explain Wendy Norris and Annette Zulian\u2019s decision to travel up from Wollongong to spend $1,400 on Hawke\u2019s crystal Versace ashtray? \u201cEverybody loved Bob Hawke,\u201d Zulian said. \u201cWe saw him speak at a Labor function only a couple of years ago and he was just brilliant. He got up and sang Solidarity Forever. He was just a normal person, you know, have a beer, have a yarn have a smoke. He was one of us.\u201d Norris added: \u201cEverybody loved him and everybody trusted him. And if he\u2019d ever knocked on my door I\u2019d have let him in.\u201d But why the ashtray? \u201cIt\u2019s Versace,\u201d Norris explained. \u201cBut it\u2019s also something he would have used and maybe cared about, you know?\u201d Vince Elias paid $1,400 for a Pakistani cigarette case. He conceded he probably paid \u201ca little bit more\u201d than it was worth \u2013 it had a reserve of between $100 and $200 \u2013 but, \u201cit\u2019s a piece of history\u201d. One of Hawke\u2019s most profound legacies was his tearful promise to allow Chinese students to stay in Australia after the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. So it is perhaps unsurprising that anything with a link to China went for well above its reserve. A Chinese famille jaune porcelain vase sold for $4,600. A pair of carved Chinese bone horses fetched $6,000. James Xie spent $20,000 on a miniature Chinese bookcase given to Hawke as a gift by Zhao Ziyang, China\u2019s premier between 1980 and 1987. It had been listed with a reserve of between $300 and $500. Xie, who came to Australia 30 years ago from China \u2013 but not because of Tiananmen \u2013 became emotional when explaining his affection for Hawke. \u201cI have great, great respect for both men [Hawke and Zhao ],\u201d he said. \u201cI was not one of the ones who came to Australia after but I know what he did for a lot of Chinese university students. When he died, I heard the speech he gave after when he cried and I also shed some tears.\u201d Was it worth paying so much? \u201cCertainly,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery cent.\u201d",

It\u2019s the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/25/ben-stokes-ashes-cricket\" title=\"\">most astonishing game</a>!\u201d A languorous, world-weary voice replied from the garden: \u201cCricket! Always astonishing. Always historic. Always unprecedented.\u201d She never budged.</p> <p>It is true that this was cricket\u2019s second astonishing-historic-unprecedented Sunday in six weeks. It is also true it was being shown on Sky, whose policy is that everything must be treated as a-h-u even if it\u2019s a goalless draw between Barrow and Boreham Wood. Which makes it hard to recognise an a-h-u when you see it. And on Sunday we really did (except our visitor).</p> <p>On such occasions, it is easy to get confused between a great game and a great finish. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/14/england-new-zealand-cricket-world-cup-final-match-report-super-over\" title=\"\">The World Cup final</a> was a fairly typical 50-over contest, spiced up by the gravity of the occasion and the Stokes/Buttler\u2011led revival of the England innings. Planet Earth spectacularly lurched off its axis in the final moments but Headingley \u201919 had more.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/27/troubled-ben-stokes-summer-ashes-headingley-hero-england\">Once troubled Ben Stokes now has a summer he will always own | Andy Bull</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There have been 2,358 Test matches played since 1877. In terms of closeness Headingley 2019 has a lot of competition. Two Tests have been tied, both involving Australia, against West Indies and India. Two have been drawn with the scores level and the fourth innings still in progress, the first being the \u201cwe flippin\u2019 murdered \u2019em\u201d Test in Bulawayo in 1996, named after the scorecard-defying response of England\u2019s coach, David Lloyd, perhaps the most quoted of all his many quotable comments.</p> <p>There has been a one-run win (West Indies over Australia in 1993), a two- runner (Edgbaston 2005 of beloved memory) and two three\u2011runners, also both Ashes Tests, at Old Trafford in 1902 and Melbourne 80 years later. This time England\u2019s win was by one wicket, which is in itself no big deal. It was the 14th in all and not even the first this year (Sri Lanka did the same to South Africa in February).</p> <p>Indeed, 18 Ashes Tests have been decided by one or two wickets or fewer than 20 runs. The score in these matches is 13-5 to England, and Australia\u2019s last win was in 1925. This stat must mean something but I\u2019m not sure what. The British ability to defy seemingly impossible odds (Betfair made them a 35-1 chance at one stage on Sunday)?</p> <p>England were of course 500-1 at Headingley in 1981 but that was more PR stunt than serious assessment. There is a school of thought that this long-ago win wrecked English cricket for years, making the team dependent on blind optimism rather than logic, practice and application. For God\u2019s sake don\u2019t pass the 13-5 figure to Downing Street. It\u2019ll make things 10 times worse.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cae62073ee77323a1247df3415382e20fdeafd0f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cae62073ee77323a1247df3415382e20fdeafd0f/512_431_4290_2575/1000.jpg\" alt=\"West Indies celebrate\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">West Indies celebrate as Australia\u2019s Ian Meckiff is run out with one ball left in the first tied Test at Brisbane in 1960.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Central Press/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many superlatives have been offered these past couple of days. For Ben Stokes and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/aug/26/jack-leach-cult-hero-ashes-cricket\" title=\"\">his magnificent sidekick Jack Leach</a>: Sancho Panza to his Quixote; Tonto to his Lone Ranger; Passepartout to his Phileas Fogg. Their stand passes the a-h-u exam with flying colours. Stokes took dozens of risks and got away with them brilliantly. It was indeed the stuff of fiction. But the greatest innings of all time, as some suggest? It might not be quite the same (an old fogey writes) as a few of Don Bradman\u2019s.</p> <p>Assessing whether this was the greatest cricket match ever played is also tricky. Quality would be one criterion and, as we all know, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/23/england-australia-third-ashes-test-day-two-match-report\" title=\"\">England\u2019s first-innings batting was atrocious</a>. And Australia were without their best player. You do remember Steve Smith? But you can only play the opposition who turn up and quality is also hard to quantify. All sport is about making fewer mistakes than the opposition.</p> <p>Was Headingley compelling from start to finish? Almost. Australia\u2019s second innings was a dire time but perhaps not to an Australian. And in hindsight that slow buildup of English pain was crucial to the plot \u2013 the way great detective novels accrete evidence, all pointing to the wrong suspect.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Above all, because the Ashes were on the line, presumed already won and lost, the match had context. Headingley in 1981 and Edgbaston in 2005 were important battles that turned the tide at the time but both came early in the series and neither could have settled the war on their own, whoever won.</p> <p>The most enjoyable Test I watched involved Mike Atherton and Alec Stewart defying the West Indies quicks and conjuring a three-wicket victory in Trinidad in 1998. But that was a very personal memory and meant little in the great scheme of things. Athers was gone as captain five weeks later, something that may yet happen to Joe Root in three.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/26/ben-stokes-hundred-greatest-test-innings\">The big question: was Stokes\u2019s hundred the greatest Test innings you\u2019ve seen?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The most compelling I remember was the Centenary Test at Melbourne in March 1977. The Ashes were not at stake \u2013 it was a one-off \u2013 and it was invisible from Britain but the memory of listening from my dingy flat to Derek Randall\u2019s epic 174 is with me for ever. Hardly anyone knew the camaraderie of that occasion was greased by the fact most of the players were plotting to desert Test cricket and join the breakaway led by the tycoon Kerry Packer.</p> <p>The original tied Test, in Brisbane in 1960, had an impact that surged across the cricketing world. Hardly anyone saw it at the time \u2013 even Australia\u2019s No 1 commentator, Alan McGilvray, was so certain of defeat he took an early plane home. But it set up a terrific series: the excitement, after much dourness in the 1950s, the class of the players and the amity between the teams helped rekindle enthusiasm for the game.</p> <p>With that match a close second, I think \u2013 for its twists, turns and thrills and its collective and individual sense of redemption \u2013 Headingley \u201919 may be the best of them all.</p> <p><em>Note to </em><em>readers: The above column contains no criticism of the ECB, ICC, MCC or any other component of the alphabet soup that runs cricket.

It\u2019s the most astonishing game!\u201d A languorous, world-weary voice replied from the garden: \u201cCricket! Always astonishing. Always historic. Always unprecedented.\u201d She never budged. It is true that this was cricket\u2019s second astonishing-historic-unprecedented Sunday in six weeks. It is also true it was being shown on Sky, whose policy is that everything must be treated as a-h-u even if it\u2019s a goalless draw between Barrow and Boreham Wood. Which makes it hard to recognise an a-h-u when you see it. And on Sunday we really did (except our visitor). On such occasions, it is easy to get confused between a great game and a great finish. The World Cup final was a fairly typical 50-over contest, spiced up by the gravity of the occasion and the Stokes/Buttler\u2011led revival of the England innings. Planet Earth spectacularly lurched off its axis in the final moments but Headingley \u201919 had more. There have been 2,358 Test matches played since 1877. In terms of closeness Headingley 2019 has a lot of competition. Two Tests have been tied, both involving Australia, against West Indies and India. Two have been drawn with the scores level and the fourth innings still in progress, the first being the \u201cwe flippin\u2019 murdered \u2019em\u201d Test in Bulawayo in 1996, named after the scorecard-defying response of England\u2019s coach, David Lloyd, perhaps the most quoted of all his many quotable comments. There has been a one-run win (West Indies over Australia in 1993), a two- runner (Edgbaston 2005 of beloved memory) and two three\u2011runners, also both Ashes Tests, at Old Trafford in 1902 and Melbourne 80 years later. This time England\u2019s win was by one wicket, which is in itself no big deal. It was the 14th in all and not even the first this year (Sri Lanka did the same to South Africa in February). Indeed, 18 Ashes Tests have been decided by one or two wickets or fewer than 20 runs. The score in these matches is 13-5 to England, and Australia\u2019s last win was in 1925. This stat must mean something but I\u2019m not sure what. The British ability to defy seemingly impossible odds (Betfair made them a 35-1 chance at one stage on Sunday)? England were of course 500-1 at Headingley in 1981 but that was more PR stunt than serious assessment. There is a school of thought that this long-ago win wrecked English cricket for years, making the team dependent on blind optimism rather than logic, practice and application. For God\u2019s sake don\u2019t pass the 13-5 figure to Downing Street. It\u2019ll make things 10 times worse. Many superlatives have been offered these past couple of days. For Ben Stokes and his magnificent sidekick Jack Leach: Sancho Panza to his Quixote; Tonto to his Lone Ranger; Passepartout to his Phileas Fogg. Their stand passes the a-h-u exam with flying colours. Stokes took dozens of risks and got away with them brilliantly. It was indeed the stuff of fiction. But the greatest innings of all time, as some suggest? It might not be quite the same (an old fogey writes) as a few of Don Bradman\u2019s. Assessing whether this was the greatest cricket match ever played is also tricky. Quality would be one criterion and, as we all know, England\u2019s first-innings batting was atrocious. And Australia were without their best player. You do remember Steve Smith? But you can only play the opposition who turn up and quality is also hard to quantify. All sport is about making fewer mistakes than the opposition. Was Headingley compelling from start to finish? Almost. Australia\u2019s second innings was a dire time but perhaps not to an Australian. And in hindsight that slow buildup of English pain was crucial to the plot \u2013 the way great detective novels accrete evidence, all pointing to the wrong suspect. Above all, because the Ashes were on the line, presumed already won and lost, the match had context. Headingley in 1981 and Edgbaston in 2005 were important battles that turned the tide at the time but both came early in the series and neither could have settled the war on their own, whoever won. The most enjoyable Test I watched involved Mike Atherton and Alec Stewart defying the West Indies quicks and conjuring a three-wicket victory in Trinidad in 1998. But that was a very personal memory and meant little in the great scheme of things. Athers was gone as captain five weeks later, something that may yet happen to Joe Root in three. The most compelling I remember was the Centenary Test at Melbourne in March 1977. The Ashes were not at stake \u2013 it was a one-off \u2013 and it was invisible from Britain but the memory of listening from my dingy flat to Derek Randall\u2019s epic 174 is with me for ever. Hardly anyone knew the camaraderie of that occasion was greased by the fact most of the players were plotting to desert Test cricket and join the breakaway led by the tycoon Kerry Packer. The original tied Test, in Brisbane in 1960, had an impact that surged across the cricketing world. Hardly anyone saw it at the time \u2013 even Australia\u2019s No 1 commentator, Alan McGilvray, was so certain of defeat he took an early plane home. But it set up a terrific series: the excitement, after much dourness in the 1950s, the class of the players and the amity between the teams helped rekindle enthusiasm for the game. With that match a close second, I think \u2013 for its twists, turns and thrills and its collective and individual sense of redemption \u2013 Headingley \u201919 may be the best of them all.

Five-hundred prospective Brexit party parliamentary candidates rose as one to greet their messiah in the very building where he had announced his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/04/nigel-farage-resigns-as-ukip-leader\">retirement from frontline politics</a> just three years earlier.

First it was enough for the country to have voted to leave the EU. Now only the hardest of hard Brexits will satisfy him. And even if that were to be on offer then he would probably find some reason to reject it. Because a perfect Brexit would only spiral him back into obscurity.

      "bodyText": "A bell tolled five times and then a loud, heavy metal drumbeat played through the PA system of the main hall of the Emmanuel Centre in Westminster. Five-hundred prospective Brexit party parliamentary candidates rose as one to greet their messiah in the very building where he had announced his retirement from frontline politics just three years earlier. Nigel Farage milked the acclaim as he slowly walked down the aisle from the back of the auditorium. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d he yelled when he finally stepped up on stage. \u201cWe\u2019re ready,\u201d came the response. \u201cARE YOU READY?\u201d \u201cWE\u2019RE READY.\u201d But ready for what? Farage\u2019s stated aim is for him and his party not to exist. To be an irrelevance. Yet everything he does reeks of someone who can\u2019t bear anonymity. The thought of being the lonely pub bore, tugging on a Rothmans in the outside smoking area, handing out dodgy share tips to any unlucky passerby, scares him. He needs the attention. And with every new reinvention of himself, he becomes ever more grandiose. And terrifying. Back in his Ukip days, Farage could connect with people by not appearing to take himself too seriously. For this second coming, everything about him feels slick and manicured. He has become the very embodiment of the establishment politician he claims to despise. The professional populist, surrounded by acolytes and opportunists, who feeds off misery and only really feels alive when he is at the centre of a well-orchestrated rally where candidates have been seated by region. Though much of his betrayal narrative is still very familiar, the goalposts have steadily been shifted. First it was enough for the country to have voted to leave the EU. Now only the hardest of hard Brexits will satisfy him. And even if that were to be on offer then he would probably find some reason to reject it. Because a perfect Brexit would only spiral him back into obscurity. The Platonic ideal is not on his agenda. With the audience whooping at the end of every sentence \u2013 NI-GEL, NI-GEL \u2013 Farage moved to the business in hand. Basically, he was pretty pissed off with Boris Johnson. Not just for having nicked most of the Brexit party\u2019s policies \u2013 cancelling HS2, not handing over the \u00a339bn we owe the EU and being a bit more beastly to foreigners by cutting the aid budget \u2013 but for being the better snake-oil salesman. He just couldn\u2019t bear it that he was still niche while Boris was now mainstream. So here was his offer. He had assembled 500 of the brightest and the best of the Brexit party\u2019s crack troops \u2013 step forward Jay Aston from Bucks Fizz. And fingers crossed none of them turned out to have posted racist comments on social media in the past. He was ready to take on the Tories at the forthcoming election if Johnson showed any sign of trying to palm off any version of Theresa May\u2019s deal, with or without the backstop, on the country. But if \u2013 and only if \u2013 Boris was prepared to go full no deal then Farage would support him by offering a \u201cnon-aggression pact\u201d. Here the rally threatened to go full Nuremberg. It wasn\u2019t clear if Farage saw himself as Hitler and Johnson as Stalin or vice versa, but the previous non-aggression pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in August 1939 hadn\u2019t ended particularly well for Poland. The UK had voted for Brexit and the people were going to get the Brexit they were given whether they liked it or not. For poorer or for even poorer.

In this new world order, Farage would achieve immortality. Possibly even divinity. Elsewhere, there was the merest hint of a rebel alliance with a cross-party agreement to block no deal and a no-prorogation declaration at Church House. Its only fault was that it all felt too polite, too rational, too parliamentary. Too little even, as no one can agree what happens next after no deal. Revoke article 50? A second referendum? May\u2019s deal? Or some other, as yet unspecified deal? No one knows.

For example, scientists now say the unprecedented heat and wildfires across the northern hemisphere in 2018 \u201c<a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/northern-hemispheres-extreme-heatwave-in-2018-impossible-without-climate-change\">could not have occurred without human-induced climate change</a>\u201d.

The polar region is heating more rapidly, reducing the temperature difference with lower latitudes. There is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/27/climate-change-human-fingerprint-found-on-global-extreme-weather\">strong evidence that this is weakening the planetary waves</a> (including the jet stream) that normally meander over Europe, Asia and North America.</p>\n    <p>When these waves stall, weather gets fixed over regions and becomes extreme. This has been linked to past floods in Pakistan, heatwaves in Russia and drought in California.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Most of the planet\u2019s trapped heat goes into the oceans and rising sea temperatures mean more energy for hurricanes and typhoons. <a href=\"https://public.wmo.int/en/media/news/another-unprecedented-tropical-cyclone-and-flooding-hits-mozambique\">Record-breaking cyclones hit Mozambique</a> in March and April. The deluge delivered in the US by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 was made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/13/global-warming-made-hurricane-harvey-deadly-rains-three-times-more-likely-research-shows\">three times more likely by climate change</a>.

For droughts, 65% were definitely affected by our hotter world, while the figure for floods was 57%.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson\u2019s support for Britain\u2019s \u201cworld leading\u201d battery sector risks being undermined by government policy, according to the industry. A coalition of trade groups and technology firms have written an open letter to the Guardian that calls for urgent changes to policies they say threaten to hold the sector back. Johnson used his first speech as prime minister in the House of Commons last month to support Britain\u2019s burgeoning battery manufacturing industry, which he said was leading the world. However, battery makers and operators fear that a string of policy changes, such as the decision to increase VAT on home batteries from 5% to 20% from October, could scupper growth in the sector despite the increasing need to build a more flexible energy system. The Renewable Energy Association (REA) joined Beama (British Electrotechnical and Allied Manufacturers\u2019 Association) to warn Johnson that his words now require action. \u201cThe government has set out strong ambitions for the UK to be a world leader in flexible generation \u2026 However, their rhetoric is not being matched by action,\u201d they write. \u201cIn the last two years Ofgem has removed embedded benefits for distributed generation and storage, derated benefits for batteries in the capacity market and eliminated feed-in-tariffs for rooftop solar. Government now also plans to increase network charges and hike VAT for homeowners who invest in residential solar and storage. \u201cIf the new prime minister is serious about maximising the advantages from the shift to decentralised energy, the government must set clearer targets and a roadmap for reform of our electricity system and show greater urgency in putting in place the framework for an open market in flexible generation.\u201d The trade groups were joined by energy storage companies, including Zenobe Energy and iBMS Solutions, which said poor policy threatened to undermine the UK battery industry. Their warning comes after an industry report found that the UK risked being left out of the European boom in home batteries because of a tax hike on solar-battery systems. The report by consultants at Wood MacKenzie predicted that Europe\u2019s home battery capacity could rise fivefold in the next five years but the UK would lag behind owing to the British government\u2019s \u201cunfavourable\u201d policies. Since then energy storage companies have called on National Grid to build a bigger backup reserve with more batteries after Britain\u2019s biggest blackout in more than a decade. Nina Skorupska, the chief executive of the REA, said the rapid roll-out of cheap renewable energy required a global move towards smart technology to help integrate wind and solar power. \u201cBritish companies are at the fore of navigating this shift and if we successfully build a thriving market for storage at home it will strengthen our hand when it comes time to export these technologies abroad,\u201d she said. Skorupska added: \u201cIt\u2019s an exciting time for this sector, but cuts affecting battery deployment in homes, businesses, and co-located with generations sites seriously undermine our potential global competitiveness in the future.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Increasing Australia\u2019s annual humanitarian intake to 44,000 by 2023 would bring an extra $37.7bn to the economy in the next 50 years, a report from Oxfam Australia has said. The increase \u2013 building on the current intake of 18,750 a year \u2013 would also sustain an average of 35,000 jobs a year, and increase demand for goods and services by $18.2bn. The findings, by Deloitte Access Economics, were commissioned by Oxfam Australia and published in a report which called for the federal government to commit to the increase, and to also create a visa stream for 10,000 humanitarian family reunifications annually. \u201cI think Australians generally would agree that families \u2013 particularly those who have suffered terrible hardship and persecution \u2013 shouldn\u2019t to be separated,\u201d the Oxfam Australia chief executive, Lyn Morgain, said. \u201cI don\u2019t think Australians need any convincing of that \u2026 but this [report] helps us understand that we would experience an economic benefit also.\u201d The 44,000 figure represents Australia supporting an equal share of the current number of refugees seeking resettlement around the world, along with other OECD nations. \u201cAt the moment the bulk of refugees are being settled by low and middle income countries, like Uganda, Turkey, Bangladesh,\u201d Morgain said. \u201cIn 2018 less than 7% of refugees requiring settlement were successfully settled. So there is a need for the Australian community to step up as the number of displaced people increases.\u201d The report said the economic benefits would increase over time as humanitarian migrants settled in to life, finished education and training, and started work. This could meet labour needs in the expanding sectors of health and aged care, it added. But at the moment, what Morgain described as an \u201cexceptionally complex\u201d process to reunite split families in Australia was also delaying the start of this resettlement. In 2004 Dabessa was jailed in Ethiopia for three years, under suspicion of supporting an ethnic minority opposition. Once free, he and his wife Lelisse, both journalists, learned there were plans to arrest him again and they decided he should flee to Kenya. However, while he was in Nairobi, Lelisse was arrested and jailed. Their three children got to Kenya, and Dabessa brought them to Australia as refugees. \u201cMentally always you are thinking of the missed parent,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cYou aren\u2019t active in day-to-day activities, engaging with services, or work, and you focus only on looking after the kids.\u201d Dabessa said he focused on study and had to rely on welfare so he could take care of his children. \u201cI was not productive in that time, but in terms of looking after the kids and nurturing them it was quality,\u201d he said. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning He saved what he could to send back to Ethiopia and support Lelisse while she was in jail, but after she was freed it took another three years to have her join her family in Australia. The family had not lived safely together for nine years. Dabessa said he was grateful for Australia\u2019s protection but if Lelisse had been able to join them sooner it would have greatly reduced the trauma on the family, as well as allowed him to contribute to his new home country sooner. \u201cThe more you suppress your emotions and your trauma the accumulative impact is huge. Sometimes it comes later, you don\u2019t realise.\u201d Oxfam\u2019s report noted multiple barriers to family reunification, including demand outstripping the few places under existing schemes, with the most common process seeing a ratio of 7:1. Other barriers included the Department of Home Affairs\u2019 \u201cnarrow\u201d nuclear definition of a family \u2013 which is not in line with that of the UNHCR, costs of up to tens of thousands of dollars, complicated application processes, and strict evidentiary requirements for documents which may not exist in an applicant\u2019s country of origin. The report also highlighted the government\u2019s blanket restrictions against refugees who sought asylum by boat. The report cited research showing that refugees waiting for family to join them in Australia had a higher probability of mental illness or post-traumatic stress disorder and were more likely to have had no engagement in study or job training. Oxfam said it was critical the 10,000 family reunification places supplemented but didn\u2019t replace refugee resettlements. \u201cOxfam is calling for a separate family reunification scheme that would facilitate people being able to begin the journey of getting on with their lives,\u201d Morgain said. \u201cThere is a very positive experience that communities across Australia have had in supporting the resettlement of refugees. Oxfam is very conscious that the best form of settlement is where people are able to quickly make a connection with a community.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Changchun, the capital of China\u2019s north-eastern Jilin province, has a name that translates to \u201clong spring\u201d. According to folklore, the name was bestowed by an emperor in recognition of its temperate summer. So mild and pleasant was the city at that time of year that it felt as though spring could stretch on endlessly, without ever morphing into the sticky humidity that beset the rest of the country. It\u2019s easy to imagine idyllic summers there and Lulu Wang recalls her own with glee. \u201cMy grandmother had a house with a garden where we would catch dragonflies in the yard,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was sort of the iconic childhood.\u201d The Farewell \u2013 Wang\u2019s second feature film after the 2014 art-world satire Posthumous \u2013 is also set in Changchun, but here it\u2019s foreign and alienating, as if the city of her memories was merely imagined. Like all of China, it\u2019s modernising at breakneck speed. \u201cEvery time I go back, it\u2019s a completely different place, and all the things I once knew are gone,\u201d she says. This sense of absence permeates the film, which is based on Wang\u2019s own life. Taken literally: absence in the form of grief, as Billi \u2013 a Chinese-born, US-raised writer who serves as Wang\u2019s onscreen proxy \u2013 returns to Changchun to see her nai nai (Mandarin for grandmother) one last time. Nai Nai is dying, but doesn\u2019t know; in keeping with traditional values of collective over individual suffering, the family keeps her in the dark about her stage-four cancer diagnosis, orchestrating a last-minute wedding as a guise under which everyone reunites. Billi is reluctant to lie but acquiesces \u2013 she has no choice when it seems so natural to her relatives. Absence manifests in other shapes, too. Billi grieves not just for Nai Nai but also for a loss of cultural identity. \u201cIn addition to saying goodbye to grandma, there\u2019s this feeling of sand slipping through your fingers, of being unable to hold on to past memories and feelings \u2013 unable to find anything concrete that represents home,\u201d Wang says. It\u2019s a trauma instantly recognisable to any diaspora \u2013 the feeling of suspension between two cultures, and the knowledge that to fully embrace one is to sacrifice the other. \u201cI think people have this romanticism of the homeland, and that\u2019s just not the reality for me,\u201d Wang says. \u201cEvery time I go back to China, I feel more American than ever, so it\u2019s this question of, \u2018Well, where is home?\u2019 We\u2019re always searching for it and never fully fitting in.\u201d Initial talks with production studios only furthered Wang\u2019s sense of displacement.

But the Boomers have enjoyed an edge over the three-time European champions in recent years, beating them at the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics. Although the draw may pose a serious challenge, and there is every possibility Australia could end up in the placement games fighting for 17th to 32nd rather than challenging for a medal, there is one silver lining. If the Boomers conclude the initial stage in first or second, and secure wins against the two best-placed of their group G opponents (Dominican Republic, France, Germany, Jordan) in the second round, they will avoid the United States until a possible gold medal clash. With a tough group and plenty of stars missing, it would be understandable if the Australians fail to end their long search for international success in China. The 2020 Olympics in Tokyo might represent a more realistic opportunity to break the medal drought. But Boomers assistant coach Adam Caporn insists the team is not looking for pre-emptory excuses. \u201cThe goal is gold \u2013 to make history and secure our first medal,\u201d he said. For Ingles, Caporn and the remainder of this tight-knit Australian squad, that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.",

      "bodyText": "There is an apple in my imagination, a memory. I can still picture the first moment I saw it in the scorching dusk, the first fruit of a tree my partner and I had planted just two years before. The sapling had taken root in the loamy clay of our garden and grown upwards over two hot summers and two dry winters. Now, it was bearing fruit, not yet ripe, and rough to the touch, but an apple nonetheless. The first of many. We had planted the tree for the children we didn\u2019t yet have, knowing it could come to bear fruit as they grew. It was an investment in our environment for the good of our children, an investment in their future, but we found that apple among the stones of the garden bed not long after. It had fallen, burned on the branch, scorched on one side. That squalid summer was the warmest on record and our city \u2013 Adelaide \u2013 had suffered the hottest day ever recorded in an Australian capital. The loss of our first fruit wasn\u2019t too surprising given the placement of the tree, but agriculturalist modelling has found that the common Malus domestica will struggle to fruit in our state\u2019s heating climate over the next 10 to 30 years. With eight of the top 10 warmest years occurring since 2005, farmers in South Australia have already started ripping up failing apple trees. We cut the scorched face from the fallen apple and ate what unripe flesh remained. We naturally invest in the environment for the good of our children, but that burned apple has left a bad taste in my mouth and I am haunted by a realisation: the apple tree we planted in our garden will have stopped fruiting by the time my children are my age, and we are investing in a future that is already breaking. We make so many decisions not just for ourselves now but for the future. We invest in a sense of place, in a community, perhaps in a house. We sow seeds both social and economic, knowing they will benefit our children more than us, but the climate emergency we face infringes all of it. It isn\u2019t just suburban apple trees we\u2019ll lose. 70% of our cities\u2019 trees will be vulnerable in a heating climate and many won\u2019t survive the next 50 years. Nearly 70% of our population live in capital cities, most of which were built alongside seas that have already been warming and rising for decades. Modelling suggests that rising sea levels could see my own street flood during high tide in my older years. Apple trees, leafy streets and family homes are all rather middle-class concerns, but these simple things represent a crisis that, if unaddressed by 2030, will later result in drought, food scarcity and poverty. Some studies consider these projections to be optimistic and instead articulate a worse-case scenario that could see Australia face significant security risks by 2050. Children born this year will have been conceived in the midst of a mass extinction event, and will reach old age as the worst of the climate emergency hits. The projections are complex and catastrophic, meaning that the climate emergency often feels distant, and delayed. It forever feels like an apocalypse deferred, triggering denialism, but the scientific consensus tells us that the threat to our immediate environment, and society at large, will be existential. The memory of our first apple tells me that the threat to my children is already here. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Everything is adrift. Markets have no conscience. Our prime minister smugly brandishes totems of coal in parliament and emissions have trended upwards for the past five years of conservative government. We are leaderless, and every personal response we imagine can seem all too powerless \u2013 fruitless even. School children will take to the streets in frustration again next month to protest this absence of leadership. I grieve for them, for any to come into the world now, but seeing the School Strike 4 Climate movement prompts me to hope in them also, to rethink what it is we are planting and sowing and to recentre all of it. We invest in our environment for the good of our children, but perhaps we should be investing in our children for the good of the environment instead. The climate emergency is a multigenerational crisis, so the response must be multigenerational as well. I\u2019ll join the strike next month, as will my partner and the child that has been growing within her since the last brutal summer. Younger generations are forming their response, and we must as well, for their sake. I\u2019ll hold the memory of that apple as a reminder of this, and grow my children to do the same. There is no choice. \u2022 Anthony N Castle is an Adelaide-based writer",

      "bodyText": "The peak union body has urged the Morrison government to delay ratifying a free trade deal with Hong Kong amid human rights abuses and a violent crackdown on pro-democracy protesters. A joint federal parliamentary committee has been examining the merits of free trade deals Australia has signed with Hong Kong and Indonesia, at hearings across the country this week. The Australian Council of Trade Unions president, Michele O\u2019Neil, seized on the escalating tensions in Hong Kong. \u201cIt is important that Australia treads cautiously with regard to an agreement with a territory that is experiencing significant political upheaval and instability,\u201d O\u2019Neil said. \u201cGiven the escalating events taking place in Hong Kong, the ACTU calls on the government to delay the enabling legislation of the Australia-Hong Kong free trade agreement.\u201d The union movement has long opposed so-called investor-state dispute settlement clauses contained in some free trade deals that allow foreign companies to sue the Australian government. The trade minister, Simon Birmingham, inked the updated free trade deal with Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China, in March. Birmingham said it would be \u201cfoolish\u201d to delay the swift implementation of the agreement. \u201cOur government continues to urge all parties to work together to resolve these matters peacefully,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cAustralia places great value on the economic freedoms and degree of autonomy that Hong Kong has under the \u2018one country two systems\u2019 framework, and this free trade deal which our two governments have negotiated reaffirms those opportunities for trade and investment to flow into the future.\u201d Hong Kong was Australia\u2019s 12th largest trading partner last year, with total two-way trade in goods and services worth $17.8bn.

      "bodyText": "A former Labor fundraising director says she has never seen cash donations as large as $5,000 at any dinner event \u201cduring my entire employment\u201d, casting further doubt on the origins of money allegedly given to the party\u2019s former New South Wales secretary in an Aldi shopping bag. The Independent Commission Against Corruption is investigating an alleged scheme to circumvent the state\u2019s election laws, involving Labor officials and prominent Chinese property developers, who were banned from donating in the state. Icac has heard Labor officials may have used a Chinese Friends of Labor fundraising dinner in March 2015 to mask the true source of a $100,000 cash payment from a banned donor, the Chinese billionaire Huang Xiangmo. The inquiry has heard evidence that Huang handed $100,000 cash to the then Labor boss Jamie Clements in an Aldi shopping bag at the party\u2019s Sussex Street headquarters several weeks after the dinner. The inquiry has also heaped pressure on the current NSW Labor boss, Kaila Murnain, who the inquiry heard saw the cash-filled bag following Huang\u2019s visit. Murnain is due to give evidence on Wednesday. Multiple news reports suggest she is planning to quit. Labor records purport to show the $100,000 was made up of 20 smaller $5,000 donations from 12 individuals who attended the March fundraising dinner. Patty Barrett, who managed NSW Labor fundraising events between 2009 and 2016, said she had never seen cash donations as large as $5,000 at any fundraising event held by the party. \u201cDuring my entire employment with the ALP NSW Branch, I have never seen or heard of any individual person or company donating $5,000 in cash at any fundraising dinner or event,\u201d Barrett told Icac in a statement. \u201cIf this would have occurred, I definitely would recall it.\u201d \u201cFrom my experience, people attending ALP fundraising events usually would pay sums up to $500 in cash for raffle tickets but amounts above that ($500) were usually paid by way of a credit card or cheque.\u201d Barrett said it would be \u201chighly unusual\u201d for money raised at Chinese Friends of Labor fundraising dinners to be delivered to Labor\u2019s Sussex Street headquarters a month later. \u201cDepending when the events finished, the monies were usually delivered to the ALP Head Office that night or the following day,\u201d she said. \u201cI have never heard of any fundraising monies being delivered or handed over to ALP Head Office a month later.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Barrett said she was typically only involved in the logistics of such events in the latter stages of her career with NSW Labor. Murnain was the assistant general secretary of NSW Labor in 2015. She has previously told Icac investigators that the state MP Ernest Wong told her that Huang was the true source of the $100,000. On Tuesday Clements\u2019 barrister, Stephen Lawrence, said evidence about Huang handing his client the cash-filled Aldi bag was \u201cmade up\u201d. The inquiry continues before the chief commissioner, Peter Hall.",

      "bodyText": "An expert panel led by the former chief scientist Ian Chubb has warned ministers that controversial scientist Peter Ridd is misrepresenting robust science about the plight of the Great Barrier Reef, and compared his claims to the strategy used by the tobacco industry to raise doubt about the impact of smoking. The warning, in a letter to the federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, and the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, follows Ridd launching a lecture tour in which he has repeated his claim that farmland pollution does not significantly damage the natural wonder. Ridd\u2019s tour has been supported by rightwing commentators and sugarcane industry managers campaigning against proposed state regulations limiting sediment and chemical runoff on the reef coast. Signed by Chubb, the head of the independent expert panel advising on plans to protect the reef, the letter says the group did not have a view on the regulations but it had chosen \u201cnot to sit by and watch\u201d while the science was disputed and sometimes misrepresented. \u201cThis advice to you was triggered by the roadshow of Dr Ridd and the associated industry response to new regulations aimed at improving water quality in the [reef] area,\u201d Chubb says in the letter. \u201cIt is our advice to you that the science we have seen and discussed during our 15 meetings has been conducted according to the most rigorous and widely accepted processes employed by professional scientists.\u201d In an appendix to the letter, headed \u201cfor information\u201d, the panel likens the campaign against reef-related science to strategies used by the tobacco industry and others to delay policy responses by claiming doubt existed where there was none. It quotes Alexander Nix, the former chief executive of election-disrupting firm Cambridge Analytica, who said: \u201cIt sounds a dreadful thing to say, but these are things that don\u2019t necessarily need to be true as long as they\u2019re believed.\u201d \u201cWe have seen the sowing of doubt play out over the years: tobacco use, lead in petrol, anti-vaccination, climate change are examples. And now possibly the GBR,\u201d the panel says. \u201cIn all cases, scientific evidence is, or was, disputed, only sometimes for obvious reasons \u2013 usually money. \u201cThe tactic of sowing doubt works, because there can be reluctance to change policy or regulation in the face of doubt. But absolute certainty is rare. It does not mean that what we know is wrong.\u201d The panel says science works by steadily accumulating evidence, drawing deductions and modifying them if conclusions are disproven by further work. Consensus occurs when accumulated evidence from independent scientists converges on a conclusion. \u201cIt is up to people or scientists with another view to provide evidence established by rigorous application of the same scientific process and have it subjected to the same level of scrutiny by experts,\u201d it says. The panel says if the sowing of doubt does not work \u201cthe next step in the now time-honoured tactic is to invoke the notion of a conspiracy of the world\u2019s scientists all working together to stop the outside getting their results published, or accepted\u201d. Ridd\u2019s speaking tour has been hosted by regional branches of the sugarcane growers peak body, Canegrowers, and the Australian Environment Foundation, a charity set up by the rightwing thinktank the Institute of Public Affairs, with strong links to the agriculture and fossil fuel industries. The new regulations were announced by the Queensland government in February, partly because farmers were not taking part in voluntary programs that offered incentives to improve practices. Ridd was last year found to have been unlawfully dismissed by James Cook University for criticising his colleagues\u2019 research on the impacts of climate change. Asked to respond to the letter, he said: \u201cDoes this mean that we have no right to ask questions, to doubt, or to just ask for some decent quality assurance?\u201d He said organisations were in denial if they claimed there were no problems with reef science. \u201cThey should argue the science, and the issue of quality assurance, before smearing our reputation by saying we are tobacco deniers,\u201d Ridd said. The panel\u2019s letter says the scientific evidence that underpins understanding of the condition of the reef is clear: the northern two-thirds were severely bleached in 2016 and 2017; there had been signs of recovery in some areas but the recruitment of coral spawn into bleached areas had fallen by up to 89%; that coral had a better chance of survival in cleaner water; that global heating was the greatest risk to the reef; that poor water quality due to nutrients, sediments and pesticides was also a major threat. \u201cWe believe that given the direction that quality science points, suitable policy and focussed regulation are both essential if we are to give the GBR a decent chance of survival in anything like its historically recognisable form,\u201d the letter says.",

They had been expecting their day in court to come as part of the criminal prosecution and trial of Epstein after his arrest in July. But while in life they allege he robbed them of their innocence, with his suicide in a New York jail earlier this month, he robbed them of their chance to confront him in court in person. At a special hearing in Manhattan, alleged victims of the disgraced and now dead financier \u2013 whose political and royal connections have come under fresh scrutiny since his arrest in New York \u2013 were able to give voice to their anguish. About 20 women spoke in Manhattan federal court early on Tuesday, detailing the emotional turmoil they continue to experience from their interactions with Epstein. The subject of his former girlfriend and close associate Ghislaine Maxwell, the daughter of the late press baron Robert Maxwell, also came up at the hearing on Tuesday. \u201cJeffrey Epstein sexually abused me for many years, robbing me of my innocence and mental health,\u201d said accuser Courtney Wild on Tuesday.

The infrastructure resilience call for English ports is expected to be announced by the Department for Transport this week. The British Ports Association said: \u201cAt this late stage a deal was the best way to avoid potential disruptions at the border\u201d and grants of \u00a31m would not achieve anything significant in terms of Brexit preparedness in the event of no deal. \u201cSome people say this is too little, too late. It is a tiny amount of money. It is not going to redesign a terminal for Brexit,\u201d said the BPA chief executive, Richard Ballantyne. \u201cBut equally there is not a long way to go before 31 October so there isn\u2019t much time to apply and spend money,\u201d he added. \u201cA no deal would certainly appear to be more of a possibility now and it is prudent to plan for this potential outcome. \u201cHowever, we remain firmly of the view that a deal that supports frictionless, free-flowing frontiers is the best outcome and as far as we are aware this is still the government\u2019s aim,\u201d Ballantyne said. While the industry has been apprised of the plan, DfT insiders said it had yet to be signed off officially. Ports such as Dover, the main gateway to the EU, have been preparing for Brexit for three years and believe they are as ready as they can be. But senior executives at ports have warned that if business or the government is not prepared enough for customs declarations and food and animal health checks on the other side of the Channel, there could be chaos at the border. Earlier this year Portsmouth warned that parts of the M3 could be turned into a lorry park if it was to act as a relief port to Dover. The port\u2019s director said plans to use nearby land had been jettisoned because the owner, the Ministry of Defence, had refused to release it for no-deal use. The BPA also warned that the ports were only one part of the Brexit jigsaw, and that other potential risks included lack of customs agents and government tax software systems. Before being selected as the leader of the Conservative party, Boris Johnson also warned about the impact of lack of business preparedness, revealing that just 30% of businesses that export to the EU had applied for the economic operator and registration identification number needed in the event of no deal.",

He\u2019s worried about creating mechanisms to introduce possible barriers [to Brazilian products],\u201d Mendes claimed.

      "body": "<h2>Behaviour and exclusions</h2> <p>One of the four cornerstones of Boris Johnson\u2019s package of changes is a three-year drive to improve behaviour in schools across England. The bare bones of this policy were sketched out by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/may/07/education-secretary-calls-on-schools-to-expel-fewer-pupils\">previous education secretary</a>, Damian Hinds, in his address to the Conservative party conference last year, but here the tone has shifted significantly, particularly with the inclusion of the phrase \u201cuse of reasonable force\u201d.</p> <p>Advice for headteachers, staff and governing bodies on legitimate use of reasonable force already exists, but it is a phrase rarely used in the context of mainstream schools and will be seen as a significant reinforcement of headteachers\u2019 authority.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"87ca87a1eb87cbd0f8ba1e13c42c4a1c1396d2ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/87ca87a1eb87cbd0f8ba1e13c42c4a1c1396d2ad/0_0_1252_244/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An excerpt on behaviour from the briefing document\" width=\"1000\" height=\"195\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An excerpt on behaviour from the briefing document.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Screengrab</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The schools watchdog, Ofsted, has long warned about the detrimental effect of poor pupil behaviour on standards and attainment, and discipline is a favourite among politicians as it plays well with voters. Schools such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/aug/22/controversial-michaela-free-school-delights-in-gcse-success\">Michaela community school</a> in Wembley, north-west London, which last week celebrated its first set of GCSE results, have impressed ministers with their strict codes of discipline.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2019-08-27T13:03:06/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Exclusions graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2019-08-27T13:03:06/embed.html\">Exclusions graphic</a> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2019-08-27T13:29:02/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Exclusions by ethnicity graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2019-08-27T13:29:02/embed.html\">Exclusions by ethnicity graphic</a> </figure>  <p>But the backdrop to the new behaviour policy is mounting disquiet about the effect of strict disciplinary codes on exclusion rates, and the impact of authoritarian behaviour regimes on vulnerable children.</p> <p>With the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/may/05/schools-exclusions-review\">number of permanent exclusions</a> the highest in nearly a decade, the leaked document is right to anticipate what it calls \u201cpotential tensions\u201d surrounding its changes on behaviour. It suggests further discussions in coming weeks about the tone and substance of exclusions policy \u201cso we can consider stakeholder handling more fully\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-proposed-education-measures\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-proposed-education-measures&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-proposed-education-measures&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2>Academies and free schools</h2> <p>The academies and free schools policy, which seems to have been adrift in recent months, would be given a significant shot in the arm under the proposals.</p> <p>If teachers and parents were unclear about the government\u2019s direction of travel after a U-turn by the then education secretary, Nicky Morgan, over plans to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/may/06/government-backs-down-over-plan-to-make-all-schools-academies\">force all schools</a> to become academies in 2016, the leaked document signals a fresh commitment to academies and free schools.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2019-08-27T12:49:11/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Number of academies graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2019-08-27T12:49:11/embed.html\">Number of academies graphic</a> </figure>  <p>While the majority of secondary schools have already converted to academies, taking them out of local authority control and into multi-academy trusts, the rate of conversion has slowed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b45e5c7e6fd3d95170dce196f4a4128172fdac9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b45e5c7e6fd3d95170dce196f4a4128172fdac9/0_0_1223_152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Excerpt from the briefing document\" width=\"1000\" height=\"124\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A pledge to increase funding for academies.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Screengrab</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Primary schools are proving particularly resistant. In recent months, a number of high-profile campaigns have taken hold around the country, in which parents have fought the plans, including at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jun/27/campaigning-essex-parents-win-reprieve-from-academy-takeover-waltham\">Waltham Holy Cross</a> primary school in Essex.</p> <p>According to the leaked document, the government plans to give more money to successful academy trusts to help them expand, offering incentives to encourage them to mop up challenging schools. It also hopes to build on what the document describes as \u201cthe existing success and momentum of the free school programme\u201d.</p> <p>It is perhaps no surprise to see renewed interest in free schools from the government. Johnson\u2019s senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, was closely involved when the policy was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/dec/03/michael-gove-education-dominic-cummings-policies-oxbridge\">first rolled out</a> during Michael Gove\u2019s time at the Department for Education (DfE). The free schools policy has been criticised by Labour as an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jul/13/vanity-project-debts-pile-up-for-english-free-schools-scheme\">expensive vanity project</a>.</p> <h2>Funding</h2> <p>The multibillion-pound increase in education funding for England will be the cornerstone of the \u201cback to school\u201d announcements planned by the government, with the key question being how much will make its way into headteachers\u2019 budgets in 2020-21.</p> <p>Assuming the Treasury does not change its mind, the DfE will have raised the nearly \u00a32bn needed to reverse the real-term cuts in funding that schools in England have endured since 2015.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/08/funding-zip/giv-3902iEQxUsborekW/\" data-alt=\"Pupil funding graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/08/funding-zip/giv-3902iEQxUsborekW/\">Pupil funding graphic</a> </figure>  <p>Those cuts began to bleed Conservative votes in 2017, and since then the campaigning by unions, parents and others such as the Worth Less? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/mar/08/damian-hinds-faces-criticism-from-head-teachers-worth-less-parents-letter\">group of school leaders</a> has become even more effective, reinforced by the drip-drip of negative stories about parents being asked to buy items <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/apr/09/cash-strapped-english-schools-turn-to-online-donations-to-close-funding-gap\">such as glue sticks</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f02fda45a4b290664aaa8c0f831380887ce556f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f02fda45a4b290664aaa8c0f831380887ce556f4/0_0_1257_136/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A paragraph on funding in the briefing document\" width=\"1000\" height=\"108\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The briefing vows to deliver a \u00a32.8bn increase to school funding.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Screengrab</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The new funds would also put the government on target to meet Johnson\u2019s pledge to raise per-pupil minimum funding to \u00a34,000 at primary schools and \u00a35,000 at secondary schools.

      "bodyText": "Behaviour and exclusions One of the four cornerstones of Boris Johnson\u2019s package of changes is a three-year drive to improve behaviour in schools across England. The bare bones of this policy were sketched out by the previous education secretary, Damian Hinds, in his address to the Conservative party conference last year, but here the tone has shifted significantly, particularly with the inclusion of the phrase \u201cuse of reasonable force\u201d. Advice for headteachers, staff and governing bodies on legitimate use of reasonable force already exists, but it is a phrase rarely used in the context of mainstream schools and will be seen as a significant reinforcement of headteachers\u2019 authority. The schools watchdog, Ofsted, has long warned about the detrimental effect of poor pupil behaviour on standards and attainment, and discipline is a favourite among politicians as it plays well with voters. Schools such as the Michaela community school in Wembley, north-west London, which last week celebrated its first set of GCSE results, have impressed ministers with their strict codes of discipline. But the backdrop to the new behaviour policy is mounting disquiet about the effect of strict disciplinary codes on exclusion rates, and the impact of authoritarian behaviour regimes on vulnerable children. With the number of permanent exclusions the highest in nearly a decade, the leaked document is right to anticipate what it calls \u201cpotential tensions\u201d surrounding its changes on behaviour. It suggests further discussions in coming weeks about the tone and substance of exclusions policy \u201cso we can consider stakeholder handling more fully\u201d. Academies and free schools The academies and free schools policy, which seems to have been adrift in recent months, would be given a significant shot in the arm under the proposals. If teachers and parents were unclear about the government\u2019s direction of travel after a U-turn by the then education secretary, Nicky Morgan, over plans to force all schools to become academies in 2016, the leaked document signals a fresh commitment to academies and free schools. While the majority of secondary schools have already converted to academies, taking them out of local authority control and into multi-academy trusts, the rate of conversion has slowed. Primary schools are proving particularly resistant. In recent months, a number of high-profile campaigns have taken hold around the country, in which parents have fought the plans, including at Waltham Holy Cross primary school in Essex. According to the leaked document, the government plans to give more money to successful academy trusts to help them expand, offering incentives to encourage them to mop up challenging schools. It also hopes to build on what the document describes as \u201cthe existing success and momentum of the free school programme\u201d. It is perhaps no surprise to see renewed interest in free schools from the government. Johnson\u2019s senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, was closely involved when the policy was first rolled out during Michael Gove\u2019s time at the Department for Education (DfE). The free schools policy has been criticised by Labour as an expensive vanity project. Funding The multibillion-pound increase in education funding for England will be the cornerstone of the \u201cback to school\u201d announcements planned by the government, with the key question being how much will make its way into headteachers\u2019 budgets in 2020-21. Assuming the Treasury does not change its mind, the DfE will have raised the nearly \u00a32bn needed to reverse the real-term cuts in funding that schools in England have endured since 2015. Those cuts began to bleed Conservative votes in 2017, and since then the campaigning by unions, parents and others such as the Worth Less? group of school leaders has become even more effective, reinforced by the drip-drip of negative stories about parents being asked to buy items such as glue sticks. The new funds would also put the government on target to meet Johnson\u2019s pledge to raise per-pupil minimum funding to \u00a34,000 at primary schools and \u00a35,000 at secondary schools. It would allow the new national funding formula to begin without penalising schools in big cities while improving funding in Tory shire areas. The package is also said to include \u00a3800m for children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND), a group that has suffered enormously in terms of funding since 2014, made worse by the cuts local authorities have also experienced in the same period. Meanwhile, the DfE is battling the Treasury for \u00a3800m for further education and sixth-form colleges, which would be a genuine boost for the sector and even bear out the government\u2019s boast of \u201cbeating Germany at technical education\u201d. Teachers\u2019 salaries Teachers in England may not have felt much love from the government in recent years, but the package of policies being announced within the next few weeks is likely to warm the relationship. A bold proposal to raise starting salaries to \u00a330,000 \u2013 up from about \u00a325,000 \u2013 by 2022 could help, thrusting the career into the top level of graduate labour market earnings. And the improved school funding is said to include provision for an average 3% pay rise for 2020-21, assuming the independent pay review body agrees. The DfE\u2019s briefing note says the increases would significantly raise early career pay, \u201cwith the aim of addressing our pressing recruitment and early career retention challenges and raise the quality of entrants\u201d. Hinds had made teacher recruitment and retention a top priority and the new package largely builds on that, with new policies on flexible working also to be included, plus the key ingredient of more money that had been denied to Hinds. There are also to be revisions to improve initial teacher training, \u201cswapping workload-inducing practices for evidence-based approaches\u201d including behaviour management techniques and evidence from cognitive science about how children develop. Sadly, the proposals are missing one radical move to improve teacher recruitment: a plan for free teacher training without tuition fees, including PGCE courses for secondary school subjects, rejected by the Treasury because of cost. But the Treasury is said to be more sympathetic to proposals involving the student loan system, and loan reimbursements for new teachers.",

This would keep the Good Friday agreement intact.</p>\n    <p>Both the UK and EU signed up to the basic idea in December 2017 as part of the initial Brexit deal, but there have been disagreements since on how it would work.</p>\n    <p>The DUP have objected to it, as it potentially treats Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK, creating a customs divide in the Irish Sea, which is anathema to the unionist party.</p>\n    <p>Hardline Tory Eurosceptics also object to it, as they perceive it to be a trap that could potentially lock the UK into the EU\u2019s customs union permanently if the UK &amp; EU cannot seal a free trade agreement. That would prevent the UK from doing its own free trade deals with nations outside the bloc.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was added to May\u2019s withdrawal agreement?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Joint interpretative instrument&nbsp;</b><br></p>\n    <p>A legal add-on to the withdrawal agreement was given to Theresa May in January 2019 to try to get her deal through the UK parliament. It gives legal force to a letter from Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk, the presidents of the commission and council. This stated the EU\u2019s intention to negotiate an alternative to the backstop so it would not be triggered, or, if it was triggered, to get out of it as quickly as possible.</p>\n    <p><b>Unilateral statement from the UK&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>This set out the British position that, if the backstop were to become permanent and talks on an alternative were going nowhere, the UK believes it would be able to exit the arrangement.</p>\n    <p><b>Additional language in political declaration&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>This emphasises the urgency felt on both sides to negotiate an alternative to the backstop, and flesh out what a technological fix would look like.

      "body": "<p>Connected as it is with ageing, it is not surprising that the menopause has a bad reputation. Even for women who have generally found their periods to be a nuisance, the cessation of the monthly cycle of egg production often comes as a shock. As well as the psychological impact of what used to euphemistically be called \u201cthe change\u201d, the menopause brings with it symptoms for which a lot of women find themselves alarmingly unprepared \u2013 as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/aug/25/i-miss-what-i-used-to-be-like-womens-stories-of-the-menopause\" title=\"\">many readers told us</a> when we invited them to share their stories.</p> <p>These symptoms include the heavy or irregular bleeding that often precedes the cessation of menstruation, hot flushes and night sweats, an increased risk of osteoporosis (brittle bones), disrupted sleep, anxiety, vaginal dryness and reduced sex drive. Given all this, and the fact that millions of women are going through the menopause at any one time (around 1 million women in the UK take hormone replacement therapy, although four in five do not medicate), it is remarkable the extent to which the taboo surrounding the menopause remains untouched. Even as other aspects of female reproductive health have become more widely discussed, the menopause has been stuck on the shelf.</p> <p>So the efforts of two MPs, Labour\u2019s Carolyn Harris and Conservative Rachel Maclean, to bring forward legislation on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/aug/25/mandatory-workplace-menopause-policies-uk\" title=\"\">menopause policies at work</a> are very welcome. Provisions such as flexible working or sick leave for women with symptoms might sound like common sense. But for many women, the experience of the menopause at work is one of discomfort exacerbated by prejudice. Even those at the highest levels are not immune. Dorothy Byrne, head of news and current affairs at Channel 4, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XIEFKEw4co\" title=\"\">recounted last week</a> how she was once sent home after a meeting in which her (male) manager thought she looked feverish.</p> <p>But the truth is that even doctors do not fully understand hot flushes, while HRT has never been free of controversy. Marketed in the 1970s as a way to combat the signs of ageing, it was later revealed to raise the risk of breast and ovarian cancers. Broadcaster Dame Jenni Murray, who was treated for breast cancer, was among those to speak out, and the numbers on HRT in the UK fell sharply. More recent guidelines state that, while women must be informed of the risks, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/15/hrt-hormone-replacement-therapy-wont-kill-you-but-menopausal-women-still-face-a-difficult-decision\" title=\"\">the treatment should still be offered</a> \u2013 with advocates pointing out that the cancer risk is minimal when compared with factors such as obesity.</p> <p>New concerns have been added to the old ones, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/aug/24/hrt-shortage-uk-women\" title=\"\">a shortage of HRT</a> causing difficulties and an alternative treatment known as compounded bioidentical HRT, which is unregulated but widely available, under increased scrutiny following an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/aug/26/menopause-experts-say-compounded-hrt-is-unsafe\" title=\"\">unprecedented warning</a> from experts. Legal entitlements for menopausal employees would provide reassurance to these women and others, while the menopause activist Meg Mathews is surely right that a storyline in one of the big TV soaps is overdue. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04przks\" title=\"\">Reflecting on her own menopause</a>, the comedian Jennifer Saunders referred to \u201cthe indefinable something that you don\u2019t have any more\u201d. But the loss can also feel like a liberation \u2013 and would be a far more palatable prospect were women offered the support from employers, and society more broadly, that they deserve.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Connected as it is with ageing, it is not surprising that the menopause has a bad reputation. Even for women who have generally found their periods to be a nuisance, the cessation of the monthly cycle of egg production often comes as a shock. As well as the psychological impact of what used to euphemistically be called \u201cthe change\u201d, the menopause brings with it symptoms for which a lot of women find themselves alarmingly unprepared \u2013 as many readers told us when we invited them to share their stories. These symptoms include the heavy or irregular bleeding that often precedes the cessation of menstruation, hot flushes and night sweats, an increased risk of osteoporosis (brittle bones), disrupted sleep, anxiety, vaginal dryness and reduced sex drive. Given all this, and the fact that millions of women are going through the menopause at any one time (around 1 million women in the UK take hormone replacement therapy, although four in five do not medicate), it is remarkable the extent to which the taboo surrounding the menopause remains untouched. Even as other aspects of female reproductive health have become more widely discussed, the menopause has been stuck on the shelf. So the efforts of two MPs, Labour\u2019s Carolyn Harris and Conservative Rachel Maclean, to bring forward legislation on menopause policies at work are very welcome. Provisions such as flexible working or sick leave for women with symptoms might sound like common sense. But for many women, the experience of the menopause at work is one of discomfort exacerbated by prejudice. Even those at the highest levels are not immune. Dorothy Byrne, head of news and current affairs at Channel 4, recounted last week how she was once sent home after a meeting in which her (male) manager thought she looked feverish. But the truth is that even doctors do not fully understand hot flushes, while HRT has never been free of controversy. Marketed in the 1970s as a way to combat the signs of ageing, it was later revealed to raise the risk of breast and ovarian cancers. Broadcaster Dame Jenni Murray, who was treated for breast cancer, was among those to speak out, and the numbers on HRT in the UK fell sharply. More recent guidelines state that, while women must be informed of the risks, the treatment should still be offered \u2013 with advocates pointing out that the cancer risk is minimal when compared with factors such as obesity. New concerns have been added to the old ones, with a shortage of HRT causing difficulties and an alternative treatment known as compounded bioidentical HRT, which is unregulated but widely available, under increased scrutiny following an unprecedented warning from experts. Legal entitlements for menopausal employees would provide reassurance to these women and others, while the menopause activist Meg Mathews is surely right that a storyline in one of the big TV soaps is overdue. Reflecting on her own menopause, the comedian Jennifer Saunders referred to \u201cthe indefinable something that you don\u2019t have any more\u201d. But the loss can also feel like a liberation \u2013 and would be a far more palatable prospect were women offered the support from employers, and society more broadly, that they deserve.",

Boris Johnson is in trouble on schools, and he knows it. Unless he sorts it out he won\u2019t claw back the likes of Crewe and Nantwich, and he won\u2019t have a hope of winning a general election. That\u2019s why, in the Tory leadership debates, he named education as a priority, second only to Brexit. And that\u2019s why the government has lined up the bombardment of policies this paper reveals today. Put together, they make a dazzling display of political fireworks: a big cash injection; a drive for more academy schools; finger-wagging on student behaviour; and a final flourish on raising teacher numbers. Bang-bang-bang-bang. The headline writes itself: Boris\u2019s Schools Revolution!</p> <p>And that might have been the story, too \u2013 until today\u2019s publication of a briefing meant only for ministers and officials at the Department for Education. It is full of the stories that the government doesn\u2019t want you to know, such as slashing the number of teaching assistants, as urged by No 10 and the Treasury, even though civil servants know this will go down like a bucket of cold sick with parents and teachers. The briefing advises: \u201cWe recommend we continue to push No 10 not to include this publicly.\u201d</p> <p>Consider also the focus on headteachers being encouraged to \u201cuse reasonable force\u201d on misbehaving students. Education officials caution that such a policy will \u201cimpact disproportionately on children in need of a social worker, children with special needs and \u2026 Black Caribbean Boys\u201d. In other words, it will be state-led discrimination against minority groups. Ensuring that more kids are excluded will simply feed them into pupil referral units or lead to them getting schooled by gangs, so that police and crime commissioners, note the officials, \u201cworry about rates of exclusion driving knife crime\u201d.</p> <p>Of all the many policy-impact documents I\u2019ve read, I have never come across one which warns that government plans will lead to more kids being maimed and killed, just for the sake of something that will look good across the front of the Daily Mail.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/aug/27/leaked-documents-reveal-tories-dramatic-plans-for-schools\">Leaked documents reveal Tories' dramatic plans for schools</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But what about the money? How do the sums fit with the boasts being made by Dominic Cummings, Johnson\u2019s top aide, that the <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/past-six-days/2019-08-25/news/climb-aboard-for-boris-johnsons-white-knuckle-general-election-ride-927t9nvpq\" title=\"\">government is ready for</a> \u201cthe most beautiful spending round you\u2019ve ever seen \u2026 billions and billions and billions of pounds\u201d?</p> <p>The centrepiece is a one-off \u00a32.8bn, which doesn\u2019t reverse the cuts made over the course of this decade by the Conservatives. To do that, calculates the respected Institute for Fiscal Studies, Johnson will need to stump up \u00a33.8bn every year. And the majority of schools won\u2019t see an extra penny, since the briefing makes clear that cash will be directed at \u201careas of the country that have been historically underfunded\u201d, such as the south-west, Essex, Kent and the shires.</p> <p>The funny thing about those regions is that they just happen to be full of Conservative target seats. Think Canterbury, think Stroud \u2026 think Crewe and Nantwich.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t sorting out our schools crisis \u2013 it is neutralising an electoral image problem. It is retrofitting policy to suit the polling objectives. Most of all, it is feigning concern while failing children. Over this decade of cuts, our classrooms have been turned into the new frontline of the welfare state, with staff filling in for councils in financial collapse and parents in precarious jobs or terrible housing. Any serious attempt to fix our schools would have to be combined with money to rebuild our welfare state.</p> <p>More dishonest yet is the startling pledge: \u201cBy September 2022, we want to see teacher starting salaries at \u00a330,000, putting teaching at the top of graduate labour market.\u201d</p> <p>An excellent bit of politics, which conveniently ignores the fact that teachers\u2019 salaries are set not by ministers but an independent body, and that well before 2022 \u2013 indeed before this Christmas \u2013 Westminster expects a general election. But when the headline is so good, who minds if it\u2019s contradicted by the story? Who at No 10 cares if they break the supposedly cast-iron impartiality of the civil service as long as it\u2019s printing true-blue election leaflets?</p> <p>I cut my teeth as an economics journalist while Gordon Brown was first clunking around No 11, so I won\u2019t pretend that all these tactics are brand new.

And as revealed in this memo, we have a government that isn\u2019t defined by care for the children who represent the future of this country.

Boris Johnson is in trouble on schools, and he knows it. Unless he sorts it out he won\u2019t claw back the likes of Crewe and Nantwich, and he won\u2019t have a hope of winning a general election. That\u2019s why, in the Tory leadership debates, he named education as a priority, second only to Brexit. And that\u2019s why the government has lined up the bombardment of policies this paper reveals today. Put together, they make a dazzling display of political fireworks: a big cash injection; a drive for more academy schools; finger-wagging on student behaviour; and a final flourish on raising teacher numbers. Bang-bang-bang-bang. The headline writes itself: Boris\u2019s Schools Revolution! And that might have been the story, too \u2013 until today\u2019s publication of a briefing meant only for ministers and officials at the Department for Education. It is full of the stories that the government doesn\u2019t want you to know, such as slashing the number of teaching assistants, as urged by No 10 and the Treasury, even though civil servants know this will go down like a bucket of cold sick with parents and teachers. The briefing advises: \u201cWe recommend we continue to push No 10 not to include this publicly.\u201d Consider also the focus on headteachers being encouraged to \u201cuse reasonable force\u201d on misbehaving students. Education officials caution that such a policy will \u201cimpact disproportionately on children in need of a social worker, children with special needs and \u2026 Black Caribbean Boys\u201d. In other words, it will be state-led discrimination against minority groups. Ensuring that more kids are excluded will simply feed them into pupil referral units or lead to them getting schooled by gangs, so that police and crime commissioners, note the officials, \u201cworry about rates of exclusion driving knife crime\u201d. Of all the many policy-impact documents I\u2019ve read, I have never come across one which warns that government plans will lead to more kids being maimed and killed, just for the sake of something that will look good across the front of the Daily Mail. But what about the money? How do the sums fit with the boasts being made by Dominic Cummings, Johnson\u2019s top aide, that the government is ready for \u201cthe most beautiful spending round you\u2019ve ever seen \u2026 billions and billions and billions of pounds\u201d? The centrepiece is a one-off \u00a32.8bn, which doesn\u2019t reverse the cuts made over the course of this decade by the Conservatives. To do that, calculates the respected Institute for Fiscal Studies, Johnson will need to stump up \u00a33.8bn every year. And the majority of schools won\u2019t see an extra penny, since the briefing makes clear that cash will be directed at \u201careas of the country that have been historically underfunded\u201d, such as the south-west, Essex, Kent and the shires. The funny thing about those regions is that they just happen to be full of Conservative target seats. Think Canterbury, think Stroud \u2026 think Crewe and Nantwich. This isn\u2019t sorting out our schools crisis \u2013 it is neutralising an electoral image problem. It is retrofitting policy to suit the polling objectives. Most of all, it is feigning concern while failing children. Over this decade of cuts, our classrooms have been turned into the new frontline of the welfare state, with staff filling in for councils in financial collapse and parents in precarious jobs or terrible housing. Any serious attempt to fix our schools would have to be combined with money to rebuild our welfare state. More dishonest yet is the startling pledge: \u201cBy September 2022, we want to see teacher starting salaries at \u00a330,000, putting teaching at the top of graduate labour market.\u201d An excellent bit of politics, which conveniently ignores the fact that teachers\u2019 salaries are set not by ministers but an independent body, and that well before 2022 \u2013 indeed before this Christmas \u2013 Westminster expects a general election. But when the headline is so good, who minds if it\u2019s contradicted by the story? Who at No 10 cares if they break the supposedly cast-iron impartiality of the civil service as long as it\u2019s printing true-blue election leaflets? I cut my teeth as an economics journalist while Gordon Brown was first clunking around No 11, so I won\u2019t pretend that all these tactics are brand new. But what shines through every pronouncement of this administration is its contempt for accuracy and, ultimately, for the public. This month started with Johnson dropping \u00a31.8bn of \u201cnew money\u201d on the NHS \u2013 that headline lasted until the afternoon of the announcement, when Downing Street was forced to admit that \u00a31bn of that money was not new \u2013 and that the rest of it might not be either. Similarly, these school policies burst with many spending commitments that, the private memo admits in line after line, are merely \u201creprioritised programme spend\u201d \u2013 Whitehall\u2019s way of saying they\u2019ll be paid for by cutting other parts of the teaching budget. Even so, millions will be poured into creating more academies and free schools, neither of which can be justified by any review of the evidence, but both of which Cummings is set on, intending to turn England into the most deregulated education sector in Europe. When Cummings was at the Department for Education, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, Kevin Courtney, remembers his boss, Michael Gove pinning up on his office wall \u201ca vertical map of England, with arrows showing how far academy trusts had penetrated parts of the country\u201d \u2013 a Dad\u2019s Army-style graphic of school privatisation. (A source tells me that academies minister Lord Agnew has given the map pride of place in his office.) None of this would fly in a serious country and with a press that retained a brain and a backbone. But we don\u2019t have that. We have newspapers that yelp with glee at the sight of the prime minister swimming in the Bay of Biscay. And as revealed in this memo, we have a government that isn\u2019t defined by care for the children who represent the future of this country. No, at its core is something pernicious: a cold, hard cynicism about what gets headlines, what tickles swing voters and what might win an election. \u2022 Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist",

As Germaine Greer wrote: \u201cThe experience of the menopause is and will remain undescribed because menopause is a non-event. It doesn\u2019t happen on a day or in a place. It is not announced, or applauded or deplored. It is not the last menstruation, which is by definition pre-menopausal, not to mention that you can\u2019t know that a menstruation is your last until months have passed\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/the-change-9781408886380/\" title=\"\">The Change: Women, Ageing, and Menopause</a>, Bloomsbury, 2018).</p> <p>What your article describes is the perimenopause. Women\u2019s experiences of this transition vary greatly, from being barely noticeable to being disruptive and debilitating.

In an otherwise well-intentioned article (What is the menopause and when does it strike?, 26 August), the use of emotive terms such as \u201cstrike\u201d, \u201chit\u201d, and \u201cramping things down\u201d is unhelpful. As Germaine Greer wrote: \u201cThe experience of the menopause is and will remain undescribed because menopause is a non-event. It doesn\u2019t happen on a day or in a place. It is not announced, or applauded or deplored. It is not the last menstruation, which is by definition pre-menopausal, not to mention that you can\u2019t know that a menstruation is your last until months have passed\u201d (The Change: Women, Ageing, and Menopause, Bloomsbury, 2018). What your article describes is the perimenopause. Women\u2019s experiences of this transition vary greatly, from being barely noticeable to being disruptive and debilitating. I welcome the increasingly open discussion of the subject, but please can we employ sensible language? And in answer to the final question \u2013 yes, there is plenty to look forward to.

Though I find use of the term \u201cJewface\u201d grating, Jewish cultural appropriation is a serious problem on London stages.</p> <p>Falsettos\u2019 production company, Selladoor, said it did not ask cast members about religion, gender, age or race because it would be inappropriate to do so, but fails to realise that Jewish culture doesn\u2019t fall exclusively under any of those categories; setting aside whether white-presenting Jews are white, Judaism isn\u2019t just a religion or ethnicity. So when we talk about Jewish culture, specifically in theatre, Jewish representation can fall through the cracks \u2013 whitewashed, or attributed to actors of other BAME backgrounds.</p> <p>This predicament is exacerbated by the fact that a vast percentage of musical theatre is written by Jews. And when Jews write about Jews, they often do so with a big helping of self-deprecation.</p> <p>But most of this Jewish musical theatre is imported from New York, where context is different.

      "bodyText": "Your article (Actors protest over the \u2018Jewface\u2019 casting of play, 24 August) was a response to the open letter sent by 22 Jewish actors, directors and playwrights criticising the upcoming production of Falsettos at The Other Palace theatre. Though I find use of the term \u201cJewface\u201d grating, Jewish cultural appropriation is a serious problem on London stages. Falsettos\u2019 production company, Selladoor, said it did not ask cast members about religion, gender, age or race because it would be inappropriate to do so, but fails to realise that Jewish culture doesn\u2019t fall exclusively under any of those categories; setting aside whether white-presenting Jews are white, Judaism isn\u2019t just a religion or ethnicity. So when we talk about Jewish culture, specifically in theatre, Jewish representation can fall through the cracks \u2013 whitewashed, or attributed to actors of other BAME backgrounds. This predicament is exacerbated by the fact that a vast percentage of musical theatre is written by Jews. And when Jews write about Jews, they often do so with a big helping of self-deprecation. But most of this Jewish musical theatre is imported from New York, where context is different. Jews are less marginalised on Broadway. Jewish culture isn\u2019t part of British culture the way it is part of American culture, especially in theatre. Prejudice against Jews is different here. In March, the Guardian published an article about the secret history of UK Jewish theatre, and the challenges theatre-makers face. When a Jewish audience member on Broadway hears non-Jewish actors sing Falsettos\u2019 opening number, Four Jews in a Room Bitching, it feels different from how it does in London. It\u2019s the difference between being in on the joke, or the joke being on you. David Djemal Co-founder and writer for the JEWish Cabaret, London",

The Lady Bird director\u2019s take on Louisa May Alcott\u2019s classic novel, first published in 1868, seems ready to breathe a modern, candid air into the story of four sisters confronting change and (often thwarted) ambition during the civil war.

Starring 22-year-old Hailee Steinfeld, the series promises to explore the life of poet Emily Dickinson \u201cwith a modern sensibility and tone\u201d. Judging by the trailer, this sensibility appears to be one of teenage insouciance and badassery, not unlike the kind Steinfeld played in 2017\u2019s Edge of Seventeen. The real Dickinson was a noted introvert, but in this version, she\u2019s a lark \u2013 declaring boldly her intention to become famous, strumming an air guitar, and swinging her hair as if at a club. \u201cWere I with thee, wild nights would be our luxury,\u201d says Steinfeld\u2019s voiceover as her young Dickinson boards a carriage in the night for a tryst, or at least a transgression.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GtV9V0dBgw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_GtV9V0dBgw?start=44&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=44\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Never mind that the poem from which she reads, <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44087/wild-nights-wild-nights-269\">Wild Nights</a>, has been interpreted by some as suggesting religious ecstasy instead of physical; that Dickinson spent most of her life in seclusion, or that she sought little notoriety in her lifetime \u2013 Dickinson, the television series, seems ready to hook viewers on the name of perhaps the only famous American female poet of the 19th century, regardless of fact. It\u2019s less a question of historical accuracy, which can be tedious and unnecessary (see: the delight that is The Favourite), than one of faith. Dickinson promises to take viewers \u201cinto the world of Emily, audaciously exploring the constraints of society, gender and family from the perspective of a budding writer who doesn\u2019t fit in to her own time through her imaginative point of view\u201d. But what if that view has nothing to do with its inspiration, using a young poet as a shiny flash of girl power for views over her complicated, secretive, very real mind?</p> <p>That conclusion may be premature, but it seems worth asking what these revisions offer \u2013 especially at a time when redundant and rebooted IP dominate the box office, and as new streaming services such as Disney+ and Apple TV vie for attention with any established brand. This is very much an open question \u2013 I\u2019m going by trailers here, and as ready to relate anew to school-day literary icons as anyone.</p> <p>The two projects naturally draw comparisons. Dickinson was born in 1830 in Amherst, Massachusetts; Alcott, who grew up 75 miles away, in Concord, two years later.

Second, that it has cross-party support (although its members will not be politicians).

It is obviously right that among many others the churches should contribute to the emergence of a dynamic and united country post-Brexit, however it may be achieved. Every one of us must play the part they can in this task.</p> \n   <p>The need for national healing and eventually for a move towards reconciliation is essential, and will take much time, a deep commitment to the common good, and contributions from every source. This forum is only one of many different efforts being made inside the political world and across the country before and after Brexit. Every effort counts.</p> \n   <p>Let us pray for all those in government, parliament and political leadership.

      "bodyText": "A confidential government briefing paper leaked to the Guardian has revealed a raft of dramatic and controversial education measures including billions of pounds in new funding, a crackdown on student behaviour and a further wave of free schools. The proposals were designed to be rolled out over the coming weeks in a bid to seize the initiative on education ahead of a possible autumn election. Jeremy Corbyn has agreed to work with oppositions leaders to prioritise opposing a no-deal Brexit using legislation, with a no-confidence vote in the government reserved as a last resort. The Westminster leaders of the SNP, the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Independent Group for Change attended a meeting along with the shadow chancellor John McDonnell on Tuesday, at which they agreed to form an alternative parliament in the event of the prime minister shutting down the existing one to make a no-deal Brexit happen. The first major speech by the chancellor Sajid Javid has been mysteriously cancelled by the Treasury less than 24 hours before it was due to take place. A Treasury spokesman said that the one-year spending review, called a spending round, which had been due to take place later this year, was now being fast-tracked to take place in early September, adding fuel to speculation the government could be planning an early general election. Nigel Farage has said the Brexit party may be prepared to work with the Conservatives through a \u201cnon-aggression pact\u201d if the only way of achieving a \u201cclean-break\u201d Brexit was a general election. The archbishop of Canterbury has agreed in principle to chair a citizens\u2019 assembly on Brexit despite provoking outrage from Eurosceptics for considering the idea. Acknowledging the controversy of such a role, Justin Welby said he would only take part if the exercise were not aimed at thwarting Brexit. He also suggested it could be conducted after the UK had left the European Union as a way of overcoming divisions. That\u2019s it from us today. Thanks very much for reading. My colleagues Aditya Chakrabortty, Richard Adams and Sally Weale have just published an exclusive detailing a raft of dramatic and controversial education policy proposals set out in a confidential briefing paper. The measures include billions of pounds in new funding, a crackdown on student behaviour and a further wave of free schools, which are set to be announced by the government within days. The briefing document, dated 22 August and marked \u201cOfficial-Sensitive\u201d, details a blizzard of policy proposals designed to be rolled out over the coming weeks in a bid to seize the initiative on education ahead of a possible autumn election. While proposals including a \u00a33.5bn funding announcement and plans to increase teachers\u2019 basic pay may be broadly welcomed, there will be concern in some quarters over a package of disciplinary measures that include a renewed emphasis on exclusions and allowing teachers to use \u201creasonable force\u201d to improve behaviour. Read the full story here - Jonathan Lis, deputy director of the thinktank British Influence, has written for our opinion pages welcoming today\u2019s opposition talks. Today\u2019s meeting is highly significant for two reasons. First, it demonstrates that, when push comes to shove, politicians who may personally dislike or distrust each other can sit around a table and work seriously, cordially and productively. Second, and more importantly, it highlights that MPs have the means at their disposal to stop no deal. They already had the numbers. Now they are showing the willing. The Conservative party has tweeted accusing opposition politicians of \u201cplotting to cancel the votes of 17.4 million people\u201d. Change UK leader, Anna Soubry, who was a Tory MP until February this year, said the message was yet more proof that \u201cright wing ideologues\u201d had taken over her old party. The archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has responded to an invitation from MPs to chair a \u201ccitizens\u2019 forum on Brexit\u201d in which alternatives to a no deal would be discussed. He has issued a statement on his website: It is an unexpected privilege to be asked to chair this proposed citizens\u2019 forum on Brexit. In the past this kind of gathering has, in many places and in difficult situations, opened the way for careful deliberation if at the right time and genuinely representative. I am honoured to be approached and would be willing to accept in principle, subject to some conditions which have not yet been met. The main three are first, and indispensably, that the forum should not be a Trojan horse intended to delay or prevent Brexit in any particular form. That power can only be exercised by the government and MPs in parliament. A forum must be open to all possibilities. Second, that it has cross-party support (although its members will not be politicians). Third, the process must have time to be properly organised. Jesus Christ is the source of reconciliation and healing for individuals and society. It is obviously right that among many others the churches should contribute to the emergence of a dynamic and united country post-Brexit, however it may be achieved. Every one of us must play the part they can in this task. The need for national healing and eventually for a move towards reconciliation is essential, and will take much time, a deep commitment to the common good, and contributions from every source. This forum is only one of many different efforts being made inside the political world and across the country before and after Brexit. Every effort counts. Let us pray for all those in government, parliament and political leadership. Let us pray for the people of this country whose lives will be affected in many ways by the momentous decisions that are made. Responding to earlier reports that Welby had met with MPs to discuss hosting a possible citizens\u2019 assembly, the former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said: I generally don\u2019t criticise the archbishop but he shouldn\u2019t allow himself to be tempted into what is essentially a very political issue right now. This assembly is designed to destabilise Boris Johnson\u2019s position. As such I hope he will recognise the deeply political nature of this. Jeremy Corbyn was not at today\u2019s meeting of opposition leaders at Church House \u2013 the shadow chancellor said he was busy in meetings \u2013 but the Labour leader has spoken to broadcast media this afternoon. Labour\u2019s John McDonnell has responded to the announcement that the first major speech by the new chancellor, Sajid Javid, has been cancelled less than 24 hours before it was due to take place. Sajid Javid is getting a record of announcing events and initiatives, and then within hours cancelling or reversing them. This doesn\u2019t inspire confidence. Panic seems to be setting in inside government. Dear readers, it\u2019s been fun but it\u2019s time to hand over the live blogging reins to my colleague Frances Perraudin (Twitter @fperraudin). She\u2019ll bring you the latest Brexit developments until close of play. Have a peaceful evening and thank you for your questions and comments. Our reporter Ben Quinn attended a symbolic meeting of MPs in Church House where they discussed their opposition to no-deal Brexit. He filed this report. Boris Johnson was described as a threat to the very nature of British democracy at a cross party meeting of MPs who signed a pledge to an alternative parliament in the event of the prime minister shutting down parliament to make a no deal Brexit happen. In a highly symbolic gathering in Church House, where MPs met during the second world war, Labour\u2019s John McDonnell took to the stage alongside the former Conservative MP, Anna Soubry, as well as the Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson and Caroline Lucas of the Green Party. Each one signed the \u2018Church House Declaration,\u2019 which declared that shutting down parliament would be \u201can undemocratic outrage at such a crucial moment for our country, and a historic constitutional crisis.\u201d It added: \u201cAny attempt to prevent Parliament sitting, to force through a no deal Brexit, will be met by strong and widespread democratic resistance.\u201d The shadow chancellor, who said that Jeremy Corbyn had been trapped in meetings, told those assembled: \u201cPrime Ministers come and Prime Ministers go but I don\u2019t think we have seen a Prime Minister like this who has had the potential to threaten the vary nature of our democracy.\u201d I want to warn him that we will not and let that happen, said McDonnell, who added that MPs will use \u201cwhatever mechanism necessary\u201d to thwart Johnson. More than 160 MPs from a range of parties were said by organisers to have signed the declaration. Ian Blackford, the leader of the SNP in the House of Commons, said that the government posed a threat to the security of citizens, while the Green MP Caroline Lucas said: \u201cWe will block what is nothing less than a coup.\u201d Swinson said that members of parliament had come together to make the point that they would not stand by while the government sent the country into a \u201ccatastrophic no deal Brexit.\u201d While Conservative MPs were conspicuous by their absence from the event, there was a highly symbolic moment when the former Tory MP and minister addressed the event, standing on stage while McDonnell sat beside her. She said that she hoped that when the history books were written they would record their determination and courage and show that there were those who acted while others stood by and did nothing. \u201cYou all know who the people of courage are and those who have failed to exercise it. They will stop you in the corridors and say: \u2018of course this is absolute madness\u2019 but they will not go and do the right thing, which is to be true to their principles.\u201d The Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn has written to 116 Tory MPs, including former prime minister Theresa May, Philip Hammond, David Gauke and Greg Clark, urging them to support cross-party efforts to stop no-deal Brexit. Here\u2019s the full text of the letter: Dear colleague, I am writing to you after convening a meeting earlier today with the leaders of other opposition parties on how we can work together, across Parliament to prevent a damaging No Deal exit from the European Union. At that meeting, we agreed to make efforts to put party politics aside to find a way through the present crisis. We know there is a majority in parliament against No Deal. As MPs we\u2019ve voted against No Deal on a number of occasions and we did so in the largest number on 27 March of this year. As you were one of 116 Conservative or independent MPs who voted against No Deal that day and are not on the government frontbench, I am writing to you to offer to work together, in a collegiate, cross party spirit, to find a practical way to prevent No Deal. This is an urgent task. The Prime Minister is reportedly planning to suspend parliament to force through a No Deal crash out. This action would be, according to legal advice I\u2019ve received from Shadow Attorney General Shami Chakrabarti, \u201cthe gravest abuse of power and attack upon UK constitutional principle in living memory\u201d. My view is that holding a general election after an extension is achieved is the simplest and most democratic way to prevent No Deal and to let the people of this country decide our future. Indeed, it is the best route to a referendum or leaving the EU with a deal. I understand not all colleagues may agree. So I would like to invite you to join a dialogue with myself, as leader of the Labour Party, and other opposition parties, to find a way for the clear will of parliament against No Deal to express itself. Please respond by email. Yours sincerely, Jeremy Corbyn This from our chief political correspondent Jessica Elgot on Sajid Javid\u2019s cancelled speech. The chancellor has been meeting Trump\u2019s treasury secretary on Tuesday. The first major speech by the chancellor Sajid Javid has been mysteriously cancelled by the Treasury less than 24 hours before it was due to take place. A Treasury spokesman said that the one-year spending review, called a spending round, which had been due to take place later this year, was now being fast-tracked to take place in early September, adding fuel to speculation the government could be planning an early general election. The speech, which was due to take place in Birmingham, was billed as Javid \u201coutlining his vision for the UK economy.\u201d In an email to attendees, the Treasury press office said the speech was being rescheduled but gave no other reasoning. \u201cThe forthcoming Spending Round will instead be brought forward in early September and will cover the themes and priorities he was due to outline,\u201d the email said. Just in case you were wondering what the former prime minister is up to today... Our Ben Quinn has escaped the Brexit party rally and is at Church House to watch MPs pledge to form an alternative parliament if Boris Johnson shuts down the Commons to make a no-deal Brexit happen. MPs who are working together to oppose no-deal Brexit are about to issue a joint statement to the media. We\u2019ve set up a live stream of the event but you might want to give it a couple of minutes. It\u2019s currently a video of John McDonnell telling Keir Starmer about pruning his hedge. I\u2019ll let you know when they get started. Here\u2019s how the lawyer and writer David Allen Green reads today\u2019s developments: Caroline Lucas is the latest anti-Brexit MP to say the meeting at Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s office was a success. But No 10 are not happy, according to the BBC\u2019s Nick Eardley. The prime minister\u2019s press team are probably sick to the back teeth of finding new ways to say it, but Boris Johnson\u2019s Twitter account has sent out a useful lunchtime reminder about his government\u2019s Brexit policy. The Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, has told the BBC\u2019s World at One programme that the meeting in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s office with other leaders trying to stop no-deal Brexit was \u201cvery positive\u201d. Swinson confirmed that the leaders did not discuss who would lead a caretaker government if the prime minister lost a vote of no confidence She told the show: What is clear is there is a real sense of urgency. We don\u2019t have time to lose. We are very much looking to act as soon as possible. So it looks a September battle for Brexit in parliament has been confirmed, with the nuclear option of a no confidence vote reserved for early October. Sir Oliver Letwin and other policy mavericks will need to rev up their legislative Spitfires for one last go at seeing off a no-deal Brexit. Here\u2019s a summary of today\u2019s developments: Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has agreed to work with oppositions leaders to prioritise opposing a no-deal Brexit using legislation, with a no-confidence vote in the government reserved as a last resort. The leaders of the Labour Party, the SNP, the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Independent Group for Change have all agreed to meet again to discuss how to stop the UK crashing out of the European Union on October 31. Boris Johnson and European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker will speak on the phone on Tuesday afternoon to touch base after the G7. The call follows a conversation between the Dutch leader Mark Rutte and the prime minister in which he said the EU27 remained open to new proposals from the UK government. Nigel Farage has said the Brexit party may be prepared to work with the Conservatives through a \u201cnon-aggression pact\u201d if the only way of achieving a \u201cclean-break\u201d Brexit was a general election at a pre-election rally. The archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby has been criticised by Brexiters for reportedly meeting MPs with a view to chairing citizens\u2019 assemblies to stop a no-deal departure from the EU. A joint statement has been issued by the Labour party, the SNP, the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, the Green party and the Independent Group for Change following this morning\u2019s meeting. They have all agreed to meet again. The leaders of the opposition parties held a productive and detailed meeting on stopping a disastrous no-deal exit from the EU. Jeremy Corbyn outlined the legal advice he has received from shadow attorney general, Shami Chakrabarti, which calls Boris Johnson\u2019s plans to suspend parliament to force through a no deal \u201cthe gravest abuse of power and attack upon UK constitutional principle in living memory\u201d. The attendees agreed that Boris Johnson has shown himself open to using anti-democratic means to force through no deal. The attendees agreed on the urgency to act together to find practical ways to prevent no deal, including the possibility of passing legislation and a vote of no confidence. The party leaders agreed to further meetings. A quick reminder: please refresh the page from time to time. I\u2019m backfilling and updating posts as I go. Our reporter Ben Quinn attended the Brexit party election rally this morning and he\u2019s filed this report. The Brexit party may be prepared to work with the Conservatives through a \u201cnon-aggression pact\u201d if the only way of achieving a \u201cclean-break\u201d Brexit was a general election, Nigel Farage has said. Seeking to put clear blue water between his party and the new Brexiter-dominated government, Farage reminded a rally near Westminster that Boris Johnson had voted for Theresa May\u2019s deal with Brussels on the the third occasion it came before MPs. \u201cThat raises a very big question. Can you trust Boris Johnson on this question,\u201d he told more than 500 of the Brexit party\u2019s prospective parliamentary candidates. He also railed against the \u201cglobalists\u201d in the Labour party and evoked loud boos at the mention of Jeremy Corbyn and the the Scottish National party. Farage said the backstop \u2013 the device intended to ensure there would be no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland \u2013 was \u201cthe worst deal in history\u201d \u201cMr Johnson, if you insisted on leaving with the withdrawal agreement we will fight you in every single seat the length and breadth of Britain,\u201d he added, to roars of approval. However, Farage also sketched out another scenario, one in which he said the prime minister \u201cwas to summon up the courage\u201d to proceed with a no-deal Brexit on 31 October but where the only means of achieving it was to call a general election. \u201cIn those circumstances, if Boris Johnson is prepared to do the right thing to win out independence then we are prepared to do the right thing,\u201d he added, before his words were drowned out. Farage said the Brexit party might then be prepared to work with him, \u201cperhaps in the form of a non-aggression pact\u201d. This from our chief political correspondent Jessica Elgot. ITV\u2019s Daniel Hewitt reports the meeting between Jeremy Corbyn and opposition leaders went on for an hour and a quarter. Our Jessica Elgot points out that Corbyn\u2019s apparent agreement to prioritise legislation over a vote of no confidence is a crucial commitment for Tories reluctant to back the government on crashing out of the EU. I\u2019m afraid this signals the end of talk about who would make the best temporary prime minister. For now, at least. Right, they\u2019re out of Corbyn\u2019s office and it sounds like the meeting went well. All parties have agreed to make stopping no-deal Brexit with legislation the priority. We\u2019ll bring you more when we have it. We\u2019re getting some more details on that planned phone call between Boris Johnson and Jean-Claude Juncker later today. A European Commission confirmed that the pair would touch base after G7 discussions while the prime minister\u2019 sherpa and EU adviser David Frost would also hold meetings in the commission on Wednesday. She said: More generally, I think we have been saying that we stand ready to, of course, engage constructively with the UK on any concrete proposals that are compatible with the Withdrawal Agreement, so this is exactly in the spirit of constructiveness and engagement that the two will speak later in the afternoon. Indeed I can confirm that he will have meetings in the commission tomorrow, for now we are finalising the schedule. There will clearly be a meeting with the task force 50 at technical level, but there are probably also other meetings following so, as the agenda is developing, more meetings could be added. A crucial development from Farage\u2019s rally: the Brexit party would form a \u201cnon-aggression pact\u201d with the Conservatives if the prime minister pursues a no-deal Brexit. Farage told the audience: If Boris Johnson is prepared to do the right thing for the independence of this country, then we would put country before party and do the right thing. We would be prepared to work with him, perhaps in the form of a non-aggression pact at the general election. The Conservative party has lost so much trust that the only way they could win a general election is with our support. I imagine the cups of tea have been poured and the digestives have been passed round at the meeting in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s office with party leaders opposed to a no-deal Brexit. While we wait, take a read of my colleague Jessica Elgot\u2019s explainer on what the key players want. Here\u2019s an extract on the Lib Dems, the SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Greens: The Lib Dems The Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, sparked a row with Labour earlier this month when she argued that if he won a vote of no confidence, Corbyn should be willing to cede the leadership of any caretaker government to another senior politician. On Sunday, the shadow trade secretary, Barry Gardiner, accused Swinson of being petulant. There may be a background question of self-interest however \u2013 Lib Dems would stand to gain significantly from a snap election, while the Brexit question still hangs in the balance or while remainers feel betrayed by no deal, and the wind may have gone out of their sails if an election is held later rather than sooner. The SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Greens The Green party MP, Caroline Lucas, has said she would back Corbyn as an interim prime minister and said other MPs and parties must be realistic when it comes to the trade-offs needed to stop no deal. The SNP has also confirmed it would back Corbyn in a no-confidence vote against the prime minister, though the party\u2019s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, was non-committal as to whether his party would back a caretaker Corbyn government. Like the Lib Dems, polling indicates, the party could fare well in a snap election. Plaid Cymru\u2019s leader, Adam Price, has said his party is \u201cprepared to consider supporting Jeremy Corbyn as a potential leader of a caretaker government if that is the means by which we can avoid the disaster of a no-deal Brexit\u201d. But Price said support could be conditional on Labour committing to campaigning for a remain vote in a second referendum. It turns out Boris Johnson\u2019s conversation with the Dutch leader, Mark Rutte, has taken place much earlier than expected. Rutte said the EU27 remained open to new proposals from the UK government that were compatible with the withdrawal agreement, but they must respect the single market and not necessitate a hard border in Ireland. Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, has started a five-city Brexit tour of EU capitals to reinforce the importance of backstop and Good Friday agreement for economic and social stability in Ireland. His message flies in the face of claims that the EU has been showing the first signs of bending on the backstop after Boris Johnson\u2019s first appearance at a G7 summit in Biarritz at the weekend. Commenting in Dublin before the trip and before a meeting with his Norwegian counterpart on Monday night, Coveney spoke of a diplomatic outreach programme to help other nations understand the \u201cunique\u201d impact of Brexit on the island of Ireland. He also said \u201cthe complex constitutional arrangements in Northern Ireland, the experiences of border communities in the past, and the interwoven nature of relationships on the island can be best understood by a visit to the area\u201d. Coveney is expected to repeat this message in Prague today, in Paris on Wednesday, in Helsinki on Thursday and Friday and in Warsaw on Sunday. Last week in Dublin, Coveney said it was not the case that the Irish government was refusing to talk to the UK, but said he would not be facilitating the UK in walking away from commitments in the withdrawal agreement. The Brexit party leader\u2019s abrasive speech ends with a simple message for the government and opposition parties: \u201cWe are ready.\u201d In another Trumpian flourish, Farage criticises Labour as a \u201cremain, second referendum party\u201d, calling on Brexit-supporting Labour voters in south Wales, the Midlands and the north to join the Brexit party. Labour has become the reserve of \u201cupper middle class globalists\u201d who have \u201clost touch with their patriotic roots\u201d, according to Farage. Farage is still going on the withdrawal agreement, warning the prime minister that the Brexit party will fight the Conservatives in \u201cevery single seat up and down the country\u201d if he tries to revive Theresa May\u2019s deal. The former Ukip leader tells Johnson to deliver a \u201cclean break Brexit\u201d or \u201cpolitically die\u201d. The Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, starts by criticising the prime minister for \u201cgoing off the rails\u201d, questioning whether the public should trust Boris Johnson on Brexit. Farage then spends a long time attacking the withdrawal agreement with the EU, calling it the \u201cworst deal in history\u201d even without the backstop. A quick \u201cBrexit means breakfast\u201d update: the Brexit party chairman, Richard Tice, stumbles as he introduces Nigel Farage, asking parliamentary candidates to welcome \u201cthe person who has fought for breakfast \u2026 for Brexit\u201d. It happens to even the most ardent Brexiteers \u2026 Farage is addressing the audience now. I\u2019ll bring you the most important clips. Again, you can follow along here: The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, is feeling well enough after emergency gallbladder surgery to speak to Boris Johnson on the phone this afternoon. The prime minister will also speak with the Dutch leader, Mark Rutte, this evening, according to our Jennifer Rankin. The Brexit party is currently unveiling hundreds of parliamentary candidates in Westminster, with its leader, Nigel Farage, expected to give a speech shortly. You can follow the event using the link below \u2013 the chairman, Richard Tice, is telling candidates they are \u201cmore ready\u201d than any other party. Supporting the prime minister in calling a general election, even if the vote took place just days before the Brexit deadline, is one option the Labour leadership would support to avoid a no deal, reports our political editor Heather Stewart. The Labour leader\u2019s team are convinced a no-deal Brexit could be thwarted by securing an extension from Britain\u2019s EU partners, even after the European council meets on 17 October. Johnson is widely believed to be plotting a snap poll if MPs try to thwart his Brexit plans \u2013 by passing legislation forcing him to ask for an extension to article 50, for example. However, under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, the prime minister would need a two-thirds majority to call a general election before the next one is due in 2022. But the Brexit position of the Labour party if a general election were to take place is still unclear. During the media rounds this morning, Keir Starmer said Labour was the party of remain, would put any Brexit deal to a referendum and in that referendum would campaign for remain. Away from the Westminster spotlight, the North Norfolk MP, Sir Norman Lamb, has told the Eastern Daily Press he will not stand at the next election so he can focus on improving mental health care in the country. The former health minister told the newspaper parliament had become paralysed by Brexit and he felt he could do more good outside Westminster. The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, is finishing up a morning of TV and radio interviews with a clear message for party leaders preparing to meet in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s office in a couple of hours: unite around one plan. Let\u2019s try and put our tribal differences on one side because what we\u2019ve got to do, very effectively, is have one plan that is going to work to prevent no-deal Brexit and we\u2019ve got to implement it next week. The Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, has reiterated her belief that Jeremy Corbyn is not the right choice as temporary prime minister to avoid a no-deal Brexit. Swinson told BBC Radio Scotland that she would consider supporting a senior Labour politician who did not hold the long-term ambition of being prime minister. Here are the full quotes: If there are others, I am open to hearing others \u2026 Anybody that could command a majority in the House of Commons to avoid us crashing out without a deal if the legislative approach, which I think is the strongest and best way forward, if that doesn\u2019t work. [Jeremy Corbyn] knows he doesn\u2019t have the numbers. He says he\u2019s serious about wanting to stop no deal, and, taking him at his word, I presume that means that he would be prepared to put forward that vote of no confidence and then, if we are in that scenario of having an emergency government, unite behind somebody who can command support right across the house. He might have suggestions for who that person could be and it could be a senior Labour politician at the end of their career who doesn\u2019t have that long-term ambition of being prime minister, because I think the house is more likely to support someone in that emergency scenario than somebody who actually wants to be prime minister and is currently leading a political party. Opposition leaders are flexing their political muscles ahead of the meeting in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s office. The Labour leader says crashing out of the bloc after Halloween would put the UK at the mercy of US corporations looking for NHS contracts. Meanwhile, the SNP Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, has repeated his call to use an emergency debate to block no deal. How could opposition leaders pursue this line of attack? Here\u2019s what the UK parliament website has to say: An MP may apply to the Speaker for an emergency debate on Mondays to Thursdays during sitting time under the rules of standing order No 24. If the Speaker has given the MP leave they will have three minutes to make a speech after question time and any urgent questions or ministerial statements. The Speaker then decides whether to submit the application to the house. The house will have to agree that the debate takes place. If the house agrees to the application the emergency debate will take place on a future day, usually the next sitting day. The motion to be debated will be \u201cThat the house has considered the matter of [topic]\u201d. Good morning and welcome to the Guardian politics live blog. I am deputising for Andrew today \u2013 hoping to be the Rebecca Long-Bailey of the live blogging scene while he takes some well-earned time off. Boris Johnson is back in Downing Street after a weekend in the south of France at the G7, but the big story in Westminster on Tuesday will be a meeting between opposition leaders hoping to stop a no-deal Brexit. Jeremy Corbyn is expected to host Caroline Lucas, Anna Soubry, Jo Swinson, Ian Blackford and Liz Saville Roberts in his office around noon to discuss how parliament might stop the UK crashing out of the European Union after the 31 October deadline. Conservative MPs who oppose a no-deal Brexit are not expected to attend. Corbyn promised to do everything in his power to stop a \u201cno-deal bankers\u2019 Brexit\u201d in an opinion piece for the Independent ahead of the meeting. The Labour leader left all options on the table. We want an injection of democracy so the people can decide our country\u2019s future. That could come either by Johnson having the courage of his convictions to test his no-deal plans in a final say referendum or through a general election. In that election, Labour would offer a referendum, with a credible leave option as well as the option to remain. Labour believes the decision on how to resolve the Brexit crisis must now go back to the people to have legitimacy. But we won\u2019t rule out other options, such as passing legislation, that could stop this no-deal disaster in its tracks. I\u2019ll discuss all these options with the leaders of other opposition parties on Tuesday. I hope we can come to a good working arrangement and bring on board others across parliament who see the danger of a no-deal crash out. Forcing a no-deal Brexit by shutting down parliament would be the \u201cgravest abuse of power and attack on UK constitutional principle in living memory\u201d, according to new legal advice obtained by Labour. Our Heather Stewart and Rowena Mason have the full story. I will be covering breaking political news as it happens while curating the best comment and analysis from the web.

      "bodyText": "This might sound strange, but if you were to take all the water you would be able to drink in the next 13 years, you would have the amount that it takes to make one T-shirt and a pair of jeans. Yet how many pairs of jeans and how many T-shirts must the average person own? For most, the total number is likely in double figures, which is to say: it will have taken a lot of H2O. It is facts like these \u2013 and the environmental damage they tell of \u2013 that are driving Second Hand September, a campaign established by Oxfam and supported by Stella Tennant, who has done a shoot with her 14-year-old daughter Iris to promote it. The premise: for the month of September the charity is asking people not to buy new clothes and instead to buy secondhand, from charity shops. With September for some a month of heightened consumption, it might not be the easiest ask. As the heat turns to cool, it can be a time to think about a new coat, to ponder the new-season woollen offering and whether you ought to invest in a new pair of boots. But new clothes come with a cost about which we can no longer claim ignorance \u2013 there is no avoiding the ways in which the fashion industry threatens the planet. Especially this month, as Extinction Rebellion gears up to disrupt the source of so many trends with protests planned for London fashion week. For Tennant, who first appeared on the cover of Vogue in 1993 and has stalked down catwalks for Chanel and Jean Paul Gautier during her career: \u201cIt\u2019s going to take us a long time to change our habits, but I think that this is so obviously a step in the right direction,\u201d she says over the phone from what sounds like a breezy Scotland. For her, the next generation \u2013 her daughter\u2019s, for instance \u2013 will be able to change their shopping habits more easily. Iris already visits charity shops and it can\u2019t hurt that she has a secondhand treasure trove that most other teens couldn\u2019t even dream of, thanks to her mum. \u201cIt looks different on them when they\u2019re wearing clothes I\u2019ve had since the 90s,\u201d says Tennant. \u201cI\u2019m so pleased I kept them and they\u2019re having a second outing.\u201d The shopping habits of the older generation are, for Tennant, perhaps a little less trend-driven \u2013 she only buys about five new items a year, she says. \u201cAt my age I think it\u2019s probably quite normal you\u2019re not that interested in consuming, [and not] loving shopping as much as when you\u2019re much younger.\u201d Although, she concedes, \u201cwe all need to think a little bit harder\u201d. This is why she rates the idea of Second Hand September. \u201cIn that month, you might just think a bit differently about how you would normally shop \u2026 [it is] a period of time to consider what you\u2019re buying and what you\u2019re consuming and why: what do you really want; what do you really need?\u201d The shoot, styled by thrift-aficionado and Vogue contributor Bay Garnett and shot by Tom Craig, is proof that secondhand doesn\u2019t have to mean stained armpits and moth-eaten togs.

In case you still need convincing, here are a few more facts: each week in the UK, 11 million items of clothing are sent to landfill, and every year the clothes sent to landfill weigh as much as the Empire State Building. Proof, if any more were needed that we need to curb our shopping habits. With Second Hand September, Oxfam is hoping to make a dent.

The results, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggests optimists have an 11% to 15% longer life than the least optimistic, with a better chance of making it to 85 and older.</p> <p>It could be that the optimistic people studied were more likely to have healthier behaviours, but it has also been pointed out that most of those in the study were white, and not many had low incomes. It\u2019s also worth remembering that <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lagnado-lab/publications/harris/PsychRevInPress.pdf\" title=\"\">unrealistic optimism</a> is associated with risk-taking and unhealthy behaviours.</p> <p>Still, who wouldn\u2019t want to live optimistically? There is a genetic component to optimism \u2013 studies of twins suggest it could be as high as 40% \u2013 but that still leaves plenty of room to change. \u201cBy thinking differently and choosing company that reinforces a positive view, rather than a negative one, you can make a big difference to your outlook,\u201d says Linda Blair, a clinical psychologist. \u201cThe way you change your thinking is not just to say \u2018what\u2019s good about this?\u2019 because you won\u2019t believe it.\u201d Instead, she says, be less reliant on black-and-white thinking. \u201cChallenge yourself with grey shades. There is a middle ground. Ask yourself: what are the facts?\u201d Optimism can be reinforced, she believes, by spending time with people who look on the bright side.</p> <p>One of the researchers on the study, Eric Kim, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-38212615\" title=\"\">has said</a> gratitude journals \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-38212615\" title=\"\">writing down three things each day you are grateful for</a> and keeping a note of kind things you do for others \u2013 can help make you more optimistic. So can practising the <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2019/08/26/health/optimism-live-longer-wellness/index.html\" title=\"\">best-possible-self exercise</a> \u2013 in which you envisage your future self achieving what you would like, and think of the steps it would take to get there. Meditation could also help make us look on the bright side.</p> <p>Another important step, says Blair, is to make sure you\u2019re getting enough sleep. \u201cWhen we\u2019re tired, we become emotional and emotional usually means afraid. We\u2019re thinking about the future and we\u2019re worried about how it might turn out in ways that are out of our control. When you\u2019re tired, it\u2019s harder to be logical.\u201d</p> <p>It takes time and conscious practice (perhaps as much as a year, Blair says) to shift thinking patterns that have been ingrained throughout our lives. She advises keeping track with a diary: \u201cYou would realise that in general you have a bit of a brighter outlook.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "A new study has suggested that optimistic people are more likely to live longer, although this won\u2019t come as any surprise to those who are more prone to negative thoughts \u2013 they are pessimists after all. The results, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggests optimists have an 11% to 15% longer life than the least optimistic, with a better chance of making it to 85 and older. It could be that the optimistic people studied were more likely to have healthier behaviours, but it has also been pointed out that most of those in the study were white, and not many had low incomes. It\u2019s also worth remembering that unrealistic optimism is associated with risk-taking and unhealthy behaviours. Still, who wouldn\u2019t want to live optimistically? There is a genetic component to optimism \u2013 studies of twins suggest it could be as high as 40% \u2013 but that still leaves plenty of room to change. \u201cBy thinking differently and choosing company that reinforces a positive view, rather than a negative one, you can make a big difference to your outlook,\u201d says Linda Blair, a clinical psychologist. \u201cThe way you change your thinking is not just to say \u2018what\u2019s good about this?\u2019 because you won\u2019t believe it.\u201d Instead, she says, be less reliant on black-and-white thinking. \u201cChallenge yourself with grey shades. There is a middle ground. Ask yourself: what are the facts?\u201d Optimism can be reinforced, she believes, by spending time with people who look on the bright side. One of the researchers on the study, Eric Kim, has said gratitude journals \u2013 writing down three things each day you are grateful for and keeping a note of kind things you do for others \u2013 can help make you more optimistic. So can practising the best-possible-self exercise \u2013 in which you envisage your future self achieving what you would like, and think of the steps it would take to get there. Meditation could also help make us look on the bright side. Another important step, says Blair, is to make sure you\u2019re getting enough sleep. \u201cWhen we\u2019re tired, we become emotional and emotional usually means afraid. We\u2019re thinking about the future and we\u2019re worried about how it might turn out in ways that are out of our control. When you\u2019re tired, it\u2019s harder to be logical.\u201d It takes time and conscious practice (perhaps as much as a year, Blair says) to shift thinking patterns that have been ingrained throughout our lives. She advises keeping track with a diary: \u201cYou would realise that in general you have a bit of a brighter outlook.\u201d",

      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/aug/26/lord-bell-obituary\" title=\"\">Tim Bell</a> was famously Margaret Thatcher\u2019s favourite PR guru. It\u2019s not hard to see why. He mixed a ridiculously easy and seductive charm with wit and free-market views. He operated at the height of the then critical nexus between global CEOs, top politicians and journalists. His death marks the end of a \u201cgolden\u201d public relations era that spanned almost half a century, and Bell was one of its leading lights \u2013 and his particular star always shone brightly \u2013 for good and bad.</p> <p>I know something about Bell because I worked for him for three years in the mid-1990s. It was an odd thing to do for someone who had worked in Gordon Brown\u2019s office. I was in my late 20s, had a young family and little money, and I was intrigued to learn about my supposed enemy. Bell of course knew New Labour was coming. He hated having to prepare for it, but took me under his wing with genuine warmth nevertheless.</p> <p>The man, like most of us, was shot through with contradictions. On the surface it was all free-market, small-state nostrums, but the daily practice of running his company was a million miles from that. He treated everyone with care and compassion, to the ridiculous level of never sacking anyone, no matter how idle or useless they were. I refused the offer of private health insurance, only to be told by him that he\u2019d just pay if me or my family were ever ill. He went to everyone\u2019s leaving event and his door really was always open. I worked directly above his office and could never get past it without being called in to discuss the political events of the day, interspersed with endless cigarettes (his not mine) and calls from cabinet members and Fleet Street editors.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/aug/26/lord-bell-obituary\">Lord Bell obituary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His free-market morals found expression in his client base. He\u2019d work for almost any dodgy dictator (though I wouldn\u2019t). But he\u2019d also take on clients who had views alien to his own. Through Bell I worked to help get Sweden into the EU \u2013 an institution he despised \u2013 and I cut my political teeth working with Alan Johnson, then head of the postal workers\u2019 union, to stop Michael Heseltine privatising the Post Office. We won. Bell believed everyone had the right to representation \u2013 if, of course, you could afford his fees. To him, it was just business. He couldn\u2019t believe I wouldn\u2019t work for the fox-hunting lobby \u2013 didn\u2019t they deserve representation too?</p> <p>This was, to say the least, a grey period in my life. It was the moment when New Labour became ascendant and, it seemed, the contradictions between labour and capital could be ignored \u2013 \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/21/bring-back-ideology-fukuyama-end-history-25-years-on\" title=\"\">the end of history</a>\u201d, the political economist Francis Fukuyama called the time, and so it felt. According to New Labour\u2019s answer to Bell, Peter Mandelson (who learned much from Bell\u2019s mastery of the media), there was nothing wrong with being \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jan/26/mandelson-people-getting-filthy-rich\" title=\"\">filthy rich</a>\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Tim Bell was famously Margaret Thatcher\u2019s favourite PR guru. It\u2019s not hard to see why. He mixed a ridiculously easy and seductive charm with wit and free-market views. He operated at the height of the then critical nexus between global CEOs, top politicians and journalists. His death marks the end of a \u201cgolden\u201d public relations era that spanned almost half a century, and Bell was one of its leading lights \u2013 and his particular star always shone brightly \u2013 for good and bad. I know something about Bell because I worked for him for three years in the mid-1990s. It was an odd thing to do for someone who had worked in Gordon Brown\u2019s office. I was in my late 20s, had a young family and little money, and I was intrigued to learn about my supposed enemy. Bell of course knew New Labour was coming. He hated having to prepare for it, but took me under his wing with genuine warmth nevertheless. The man, like most of us, was shot through with contradictions. On the surface it was all free-market, small-state nostrums, but the daily practice of running his company was a million miles from that. He treated everyone with care and compassion, to the ridiculous level of never sacking anyone, no matter how idle or useless they were. I refused the offer of private health insurance, only to be told by him that he\u2019d just pay if me or my family were ever ill. He went to everyone\u2019s leaving event and his door really was always open. I worked directly above his office and could never get past it without being called in to discuss the political events of the day, interspersed with endless cigarettes (his not mine) and calls from cabinet members and Fleet Street editors. His free-market morals found expression in his client base. He\u2019d work for almost any dodgy dictator (though I wouldn\u2019t). But he\u2019d also take on clients who had views alien to his own. Through Bell I worked to help get Sweden into the EU \u2013 an institution he despised \u2013 and I cut my political teeth working with Alan Johnson, then head of the postal workers\u2019 union, to stop Michael Heseltine privatising the Post Office. We won. Bell believed everyone had the right to representation \u2013 if, of course, you could afford his fees. To him, it was just business. He couldn\u2019t believe I wouldn\u2019t work for the fox-hunting lobby \u2013 didn\u2019t they deserve representation too? This was, to say the least, a grey period in my life. It was the moment when New Labour became ascendant and, it seemed, the contradictions between labour and capital could be ignored \u2013 \u201cthe end of history\u201d, the political economist Francis Fukuyama called the time, and so it felt. According to New Labour\u2019s answer to Bell, Peter Mandelson (who learned much from Bell\u2019s mastery of the media), there was nothing wrong with being \u201cfilthy rich\u201d. Through Bell I learned how to make things happen. In the future I made sure I reserved these skills for things I really believed in. There is a bigger arc here, though, than just Bell\u2019s life, as big as that was. He always argued that PR was \u201csimply a truth well told\u201d. But whose \u201ctruth\u201d, and what happens when \u201cwell told\u201d just becomes spin? I don\u2019t think Bell cared \u2013 what mattered was influence and financial success. The practice of PR for him was to talk \u201cyour\u201d side up and \u201ctheir\u201d side down. A zero-sum game.

      "bodyText": "A raft of dramatic and controversial education measures including billions of pounds in new funding, a crackdown on student behaviour and a further wave of free schools are to be announced by the government within days, according to a confidential briefing paper seen by the Guardian. The briefing document, dated 22 August and marked \u201cOfficial-Sensitive\u201d, details policy proposals for schools in England designed to be rolled out over the coming weeks in an attempt to seize the initiative on education before a possible autumn election. While proposals including a \u00a33.5bn funding announcement and plans to increase teachers\u2019 basic pay may be broadly welcomed, there will be concern in some quarters over a package of disciplinary measures that include a renewed emphasis on exclusions and allowing teachers to use \u201creasonable force\u201d to improve behaviour. The paper, which is under discussion between Gavin Williamson\u2019s Department for Education (DfE) and No 10, is understood to have been inserted into the government \u201cgrid\u201d of announcements, as families prepare for the new school year in England. The headline figures include \u00a32.8bn for primary and secondary schools up to the age of 16, including \u00a3800m for children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND). The details for an extra \u00a3800m for sixth form and further education colleges are still under discussion with the Treasury. The main proposals in the package include: Increasing pay for teachers, with starting salaries rising to \u00a330,000 by 2022. Encouraging school leaders to confiscate or ban mobile phones. Backing headteachers to exclude pupils, with new guidance on behaviour. Offering academy trusts \u00a324,000 incentives to take over struggling schools. Opening a new wave of free schools, including alternative provision schools for excluded children. Removing exemptions from regular inspection for schools rated as \u201coutstanding\u201d by Ofsted. A fresh push to convert local authority maintained schools to academy status. Any additional funding is likely to be welcomed by school leaders, although many will want to wait until they see how much of the headline figure has been \u201creprioritised\u201d from the DfE\u2019s previous spending commitments. Last year, the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimated per pupil funding had been cut by 4% in real terms since 2015, after a freeze was imposed by the government. It estimated returning school funding to 2015 levels would require nearly \u00a32bn. Aside from funding, the DfE paper includes a major focus on poor behaviour in schools, said to be driven by No 10\u2019s view that recent polling has shown strong public support for policies taking a tougher line. The announcements will include explicit support for headteachers who use \u201creasonable force\u201d in their efforts to improve discipline. \u201cThis government backs headteachers to improve behaviour and will support them to create safe and disciplined school environments,\u201d the document states. \u201cWe will back heads to use powers to promote good behaviour including sanctions and rewards; using reasonable force; to search and confiscate items from pupils (including mobile phones); impose same-day detentions; suspend and expel pupils; ban mobile phones.\u201d While the DfE expects members of the public will welcome \u201ca harder narrative on discipline\u201d, the document warns key stakeholders will be worried the policy could result in increased rates of permanent exclusion, which have in any case been climbing since 2012. The document notes police and crime commissioners \u201cworry about rates of exclusion driving knife crime\u201d and acknowledges concerns it will impact disproportionately on children from some ethnic minority backgrounds, in particular black Caribbean boys, and those with special educational needs (SEN). The success of the Michaela free school in GCSE results last week is likely to be used by ministers to promote its behaviour policies, while four \u201cbehaviour tsars\u201d are to be named, including Charlie Taylor, the former head of a school for children with SEN and the current chair of the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales. While recent coverage of school funding cuts has included widespread reporting about teaching assistants being axed and headteachers\u2019 concerns about the detrimental impact on classrooms, the briefing paper reveals \u2013 on the contrary \u2013 that Downing Street and the Treasury are more concerned there may be too many TAs rather than too few. \u201cNo 10 and HMT [the Treasury] have been keen to publicly express concerns about the rising number of TAs and set out government\u2019s commitment to more effective deployment of TAs being integral to more efficient use of school spend,\u201d it states. The document advises against going public with this line, warning \u201cit would undermine the \u2018hearts and minds\u2019 aspect of the announcement with the numerous audiences we know value TAs \u2013 parents, teachers, heads and [the] SEND lobby.

      "body": "<p>Sheila Steafel, who has died aged 84, was a versatile and bewitching character actor with an outstanding gift for comic timing. As well as being the regular female cast member on the landmark satirical television show The Frost Report (1966-67) \u2013 alongside the emerging talents of John Cleese, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/oct/04/broadcasting.guardianobituaries\" title=\"\">Ronnie Barker</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/mar/31/ronnie-corbett-obituary\" title=\"\">Ronnie Corbett</a> \u2013 she played opposite, \u201cand sometimes against\u201d, in her words, many of the leading TV comedians of the day, including Peter Cook and Dudley Moore (in Not Only \u2026 But Also, 1965), Roy Hudd, Tommy Cooper, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/feb/28/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries\" title=\"\">Spike Milligan</a> and Kenny Everett.</p> <p>After the success of The Frost Report, a winner of the Golden Rose of Montreux, she was in demand for guest parts in comedy series. Regular roles included Ivy Watkins in the Granada sitcom How\u2019s Your Father (1974-75), the White Lady in all three series of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/mar/05/richard-carpenter\" title=\"\">Richard Carpenter</a>\u2019s charming comedy The Ghosts of Motley Hall (1976-78), and the imperious literary agent supporting debut novelist Diane Keen as she starts to overshadow Tim Brooke-Taylor in the sitcom You Must Be the Husband (1987-88).</p> <p>But while she was a game comic foil on TV, she shone as a stage performer in one-woman shows at the Edinburgh festival and various London theatres. In The Late Sheila Steafel (1981), Steafel Solo (1982), Steafel XPress (1985) and Victoria Plums (1995) she delivered comic songs and monologues supplied by writers including Keith Waterhouse, Barry Cryer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/aug/10/david-nobbs\" title=\"\">David Nobbs</a>, Andy Hamilton and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/apr/21/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\" title=\"\">Dick Vosburgh</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"06987a349b842fc6efbafd711f6e20092955ca07\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06987a349b842fc6efbafd711f6e20092955ca07/35_34_2952_4221/699.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"699\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sheila Steafel during a book tour to promote her autobiography, When Harry Met Sheila, in 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Geoffrey Swaine/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her features were distinctive, and she deployed them to comedic advantage. Her lidded eyes could be languidly seductive or quizzically innocent, her brows could arch sardonically while her face remained still, and a wry kink in her lips could curl into a feline smile, accentuated by her high cheekbones.</p> <p>Vocally dextrous but also a fine physical clown, she created <a href=\"http://www.sheilasteafel.co.uk/page9.html\" title=\"\">Miss Popsy Wopsy</a>, a woozy, klutzy ingenue \u2013 a music hall entertainer who was never quite on note and always just behind the beat. She performed the character in her shows and several times on TV in <a href=\"https://youtu.be/kHhy9oZfoeY?t=38\" title=\"\">The Good Old Days</a> in the 1970s and 80s. In person she could deliver drawled witticisms and deadpan putdowns, making her a jolly addition to panel shows such as Juke Box Jury, Call My Bluff and Blankety Blank.</p> <p>Born in Johannesburg, South Africa, Sheila was the younger of two children of Harold, a garage owner from Lancashire, and his wife, Eda (nee Cohen). There was little professional theatre, but Harold directed and performed in amateur productions, particularly of Gilbert and Sullivan, and the young Sheila would watch from the wings. Her mother was a talented pianist and so her childhood was surrounded by drama and music. She also sang at the local synagogue, where both Harold and Eda were involved in directing the choir.</p> <p>She was educated at Barnato Park school, not far from her home in the middle-class suburb of Berea, and narrowly avoided being expelled for writing a risqu\u00e9 pantomime.</p> <p>At Witwatersrand University she studied fine art, but abandoned the course to travel to Britain to audition for the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (Rada) in London in 1953. She did a term at its preparatory academy, but was told she was unusual and would probably have to wait until she was in her 30s and become a character actor.

      "bodyText": "Sheila Steafel, who has died aged 84, was a versatile and bewitching character actor with an outstanding gift for comic timing. As well as being the regular female cast member on the landmark satirical television show The Frost Report (1966-67) \u2013 alongside the emerging talents of John Cleese, Ronnie Barker and Ronnie Corbett \u2013 she played opposite, \u201cand sometimes against\u201d, in her words, many of the leading TV comedians of the day, including Peter Cook and Dudley Moore (in Not Only \u2026 But Also, 1965), Roy Hudd, Tommy Cooper, Spike Milligan and Kenny Everett. After the success of The Frost Report, a winner of the Golden Rose of Montreux, she was in demand for guest parts in comedy series. Regular roles included Ivy Watkins in the Granada sitcom How\u2019s Your Father (1974-75), the White Lady in all three series of Richard Carpenter\u2019s charming comedy The Ghosts of Motley Hall (1976-78), and the imperious literary agent supporting debut novelist Diane Keen as she starts to overshadow Tim Brooke-Taylor in the sitcom You Must Be the Husband (1987-88). But while she was a game comic foil on TV, she shone as a stage performer in one-woman shows at the Edinburgh festival and various London theatres. In The Late Sheila Steafel (1981), Steafel Solo (1982), Steafel XPress (1985) and Victoria Plums (1995) she delivered comic songs and monologues supplied by writers including Keith Waterhouse, Barry Cryer, David Nobbs, Andy Hamilton and Dick Vosburgh. Her features were distinctive, and she deployed them to comedic advantage. Her lidded eyes could be languidly seductive or quizzically innocent, her brows could arch sardonically while her face remained still, and a wry kink in her lips could curl into a feline smile, accentuated by her high cheekbones. Vocally dextrous but also a fine physical clown, she created Miss Popsy Wopsy, a woozy, klutzy ingenue \u2013 a music hall entertainer who was never quite on note and always just behind the beat. She performed the character in her shows and several times on TV in The Good Old Days in the 1970s and 80s. In person she could deliver drawled witticisms and deadpan putdowns, making her a jolly addition to panel shows such as Juke Box Jury, Call My Bluff and Blankety Blank. Born in Johannesburg, South Africa, Sheila was the younger of two children of Harold, a garage owner from Lancashire, and his wife, Eda (nee Cohen). There was little professional theatre, but Harold directed and performed in amateur productions, particularly of Gilbert and Sullivan, and the young Sheila would watch from the wings. Her mother was a talented pianist and so her childhood was surrounded by drama and music. She also sang at the local synagogue, where both Harold and Eda were involved in directing the choir. She was educated at Barnato Park school, not far from her home in the middle-class suburb of Berea, and narrowly avoided being expelled for writing a risqu\u00e9 pantomime. At Witwatersrand University she studied fine art, but abandoned the course to travel to Britain to audition for the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (Rada) in London in 1953. She did a term at its preparatory academy, but was told she was unusual and would probably have to wait until she was in her 30s and become a character actor. Undeterred, she enrolled instead at the Webber Douglas Academy, where she won the Margaret Rutherford award for comedy. After graduation and stints in repertory theatre in Blackpool and Lincoln, in 1959 she worked as an usherette at the Players\u2019 theatre, Charing Cross, which presented Victorian music hall shows, and eventually plucked up the courage to ask for an audition. She passed, and while there honed her comedy skills, created Miss Popsy Wopsy and began to get noticed. Her first West End opportunity came in 1961, when she took over the role of Barbara opposite Tom Courtenay in Billy Liar, directed by Lindsay Anderson. In 1972 she played opposite Robert Morley in How the Other Half Loves at the Lyric theatre, and she was cast as a female Harpo Marx in A Day in Hollywood, A Night in the Ukraine (New End theatre, 1979), at the insistence of Vosburgh, its writer. She won rave reviews. She was a memorably eccentric, hip-flask swigging Mistress Quickly in an RSC production of The Merry Wives of Windsor (1985), played Meg in the Birthday Party at the Bristol Old Vic (2006) and carried on to the last performance despite needing spinal surgery when playing Mrs Brice in Funny Girl at the Minerva theatre, Chichester (2008). Her films included Daleks Invasion Earth 2150AD (1966), Quatermass and the Pit (1967) and the rather less earnest Bloodbath at the House of Death (1984), with Everett and Vincent Price, and co-written by Cryer. On radio she was a regular cast member of the topical comedy show Weekending (1977-82), was to be heard in plays and readings, and performed in her own vehicles Steafel Plus (1982) and Steafel with an S (1984). In later years she made character appearances in popular TV series such as Doctors (with seven different roles between 2005 and 2016) and Holby City (three between 2007 and 2016).

When we have lacked real journalism, we have seen crimes like mortgage fraud go unnoticed and unpunished, leading to a devastating financial crisis that destroyed millions of Americans\u2019 lives. Real journalism requires significant resources. One reason we do not have enough real journalism in America right now is because many outlets are being gutted by the same forces of greed that are pillaging our economy. For example, two Silicon Valley corporations \u2013 Facebook and Google \u2013 control 60% of the entire digital advertising market. They have used monopolistic control to siphon off advertising revenues from news organizations. A recent study by the News Media Alliance, a trade organization, found that in 2018, as newspaper revenues declined, Google made $4.7bn off reporting that Google did not pay for. At the same time, corporate conglomerates and hedge fund vultures have bought and consolidated beleaguered local newspapers and slashed their newsrooms \u2013 all while giving executives big payouts. Gannett\u2019s proposed merger with Gatehouse Media, for instance, will consolidate hundreds of publications under one mega-corporation\u2019s control and slash $300m worth of \u201csynergies\u201d \u2013 which is often corporate-speak for layoffs. Matt Pearce, a reporter for the Los Angeles Times, notes that \u201cthe new Gannett/Gatehouse chief executive is getting $4.5m in bonuses and stock just for walking in the door.\u201d The result of these trends has been the decimation of journalism. Over the past 15 years, more than 1,400 communities across the country have lost newspapers, which are the outlets local television, radio and digital news sites rely on for reporting. Since 2008, we have seen newsrooms lose 28,000 employees \u2013 and in the past year alone, 3,200 people in the media industry have been laid off. Today, for every working journalist, there are six people now working in public relations, often pushing a corporate line. At precisely the moment when we need more reporters covering the healthcare crisis, the climate emergency and economic inequality, we have television pundits paid tens of millions of dollars to pontificate about frivolous political gossip, as local news outlets are eviscerated. The negative effects are predictable: according to a working paper by researchers at Notre Dame and the University of Illinois, when newsrooms are hollowed out, overall costs to taxpayers rise, because there are fewer reporters scrutinizing government transactions. A study published by Spotlight on Poverty and Opportunity, a non-partisan forum, found that, despite millions of Americans struggling to survive, budget-strapped \u201cnewsrooms have not turned their attention to poverty\u201d. To be sure, when we see the Miami Herald expos\u00e9 on Jeffrey Epstein or the Charleston Gazette-Mail\u2019s courageous reporting on the opioid crisis, we know that good reporters are still overcoming the odds and managing to produce essential journalism that scrutinizes power, exposes wrongdoing, and challenges the status quo. But we know that those success stories are too often the exception and not the norm. We also know that Donald Trump is making things far worse. He is a pathological liar who has spent his presidency trying to demonize journalists when they dare to debunk his lies. Worse, he has called the media the \u201cenemy of the people\u201d in a deliberate attempt to destroy the very idea of a free press. Trump\u2019s authoritarian bullying of the media is totally unacceptable and it must be denounced and rejected. But let us be clear: that alone will not solve the journalism crisis.

Given that reality, we should not want even more of the free press to be put under the control of a handful of corporations and \u201cbenevolent\u201d billionaires who can use their media empires to punish their critics and shield themselves from scrutiny. After all, TV networks that rely on $4.5bn a year of pharmaceutical ads may be thrilled to sugarcoat our current dysfunctional healthcare system \u2013 but they will never provide a consistently fair hearing for something like Medicare for All, even though polls show that a majority of Americans support such a proposal. Corporate media organizations sponsored by fossil fuel industry ads may gladly provide a platform for guests who insist that our current oligarchic economy is just great, but as studies show, the same outlets often downplay or omit coverage of the climate crisis that those advertisers are helping create. And news outlets owned by Disney and Jeff Bezos may happily tout Disney films and Bezos\u2019s plans for space exploration, but we cannot count on them to consistently and aggressively cover workers\u2019 fight for better wages at Disney \u2013 or Bezos-controlled companies. In fact, in one instance, we saw that the Washington Post, which Bezos owns, tried to punish a reporter because he spoke out for better wages at the newspaper. We need to rebuild and protect a diverse and truly independent press so that real journalists can do the critical jobs that they love, and that a functioning democracy requires. When I am president, my administration will put in place policies that will reform the media industry and better protect independent journalism at both the local and national levels. For example, we will reverse the Trump administration\u2019s attempts to make corporate media mergers even more likely in the future. We are not going to rubber-stamp proposals like the new plan to merge CBS and Viacom into a $30bn colossus. I have long opposed media consolidation, and was one of only 16 members of the US House to oppose the disastrous 1996 Telecommunications Act, which accelerated consolidation. In my administration, we are going to institute an immediate moratorium on approving mergers of major media corporations until we can better understand the true effect these transactions have on our democracy. In the spirit of existing federal laws, we will start requiring major media corporations to disclose whether or not their corporate transactions and merger proposals will involve significant journalism layoffs. We will also require that, before any future mergers can take place, employees must be given the opportunity to purchase media outlets through employee stock-ownership plans \u2013 an innovative business model that was first pioneered in the newspaper industry. And we will prevent media-related merger and deregulation decisions at federal agencies that adversely affect people of color and women. As the not-for-profit watchdog group Free Press has noted, \u201cWomen and people of color are woefully underrepresented among broadcast-license holders.\u201d The group points out that this is because when the Federal Communications Commission has approved mergers it has failed \u201cto consider how such concentration affects ownership opportunities for women and people of color\u201d. When our administration appoints new, progressive leadership at the FCC, we will reverse the Trump administration\u2019s moves, which have gutted longstanding media ownership rules. What Trump has done allows cross-ownership of newspapers and television or radio stations; he has also given the green light to owning multiple stations in the same market. The harm may be great: \u201cIn theory,\u201d says Free Press, \u201cthese changes would allow a single broadcaster to own both your local newspaper and your top-two local broadcast stations, plus operate a handful of other stations through sharing agreements \u2013 turning your community into a one-newsroom town.\u201d We will do the opposite: we will reinstate and strengthen media ownership rules, and we will limit the number of stations that large broadcasting corporations can own in each market and nationwide. We will also direct federal agencies to study the impact of consolidation in print, television and digital media to determine whether further antitrust action is necessary. Additionally, we will pass my Workplace Democracy Plan, which will boost media workers\u2019 laudable efforts to form unions and collectively bargain with their employers. I have publicly supported journalists\u2019 efforts to unionize. Unions not only fight for media workers\u2019 wages and benefits, they can also better protect reporters from corporate policies that aim to prevent journalists from scrutinizing media owners and their advertisers. Finally, when it comes to Silicon Valley, I will appoint an attorney general as well as Federal Trade Commission officials who more stringently enforce antitrust laws against tech giants like Facebook and Google, to prevent them from using their enormous market power to cannibalize, bilk and defund news organizations. Their monopoly power has particularly harmed small, independent news outlets that do not have the corporate infrastructure to fight back. We must also explore new ways to empower media organizations to collectively bargain with these tech monopolies, and we should consider taxing targeted ads and using the revenue to fund not-for-profit civic-minded media. That will be part of an overall effort to substantially increase funding for programs that support public media\u2019s news-gathering operations at the local level \u2013 in much the same way many other countries already fund independent public media. Our constitution\u2019s first amendment explicitly protects the free press because the founders understood how important journalism is to a democracy. More than two centuries after the constitution was signed, we cannot sit by and allow corporations, billionaires, and demagogues to destroy the Fourth Estate, nor can we allow them to replace serious reporting with infotainment and propaganda. We must take action \u2013 and if we do, I know we can be successful. We can and will restore the media that Joseph Pulitzer and Walter Cronkite envisioned, and that America so desperately needs.

I guess there\u2019s some power structure he thinks I violated.\u201d On Tuesday, Stephens announced he was leaving Twitter. \u201cTime to do what I long ago promised to do. Twitter is a sewer. It brings out the worst in humanity. I sincerely apologize for any part I\u2019ve played in making it worse, and to anyone I\u2019ve ever hurt. Thanks to all my followers, but I\u2019m deactivating this account.\u201d Previously Stephens had penned a column about how bad Twitter was for the soul. He wrote in 2017: \u201cThis is the column in which I formally forswear Twitter for good.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The way Jordi Cruyff tells the story, the way his mum and dad always told it, one day Johan Cruyff turned to the family, and said: \u201cListen, I have to put my boots back on: we\u2019re going to the US.\u201d There is a pause, a smile, and Jordi adds: \u201c\u2018We fly in five hours.\u2019\u201d He was only four but he has heard it often and, like everything else, it was a lesson. Listening to him on the morning Barcelona unveil a statue of their spiritual father, his actual father, there are many of them: moments that helped shape him, that shaped them all. \u201cHe reached so many people, touched them,\u201d Jordi says. There may be no one who influenced football like he did. Jordi has not prepared a speech. He has only just found out it is today he has to talk, not the following evening when the Johan Cruyff stadium is inaugurated at Bar\u00e7a\u2019s Sant Joan Desp\u00ed training ground. Named for a man who believed in development, forming an identity, it is appropriate it will be used by youth teams. The speech will be short, Jordi says, and anyway he prefers to improvise. \u201cThis is my dad, not me,\u201d he says. \u201cThe person who had to speak isn\u2019t here.\u201d Cruyff died in March 2016 but he is always there.

More broadly, representatives of the construction industry paint a mixed picture of the environment in which their members are operating. But as economists and political leaders hunt for the evidence that will help them plan for any future recession, there are clear signs that the construction sector is bracing itself for a downturn. According to the Federation of Master Builders (FMB), an independent, non-profit trade association that represents 8,000 small- to medium-sized building firms, companies are already reducing their headcount of direct employees in favour of subcontractors who are easily removed if the work dries up. The FMB\u2019s most recent State of Trade survey showed that employment among construction SMEs had dropped for the first time in more than five years. \u201cTheir thinking is that if the worst happens and a recession hits later this year, they need the size of their workforce to be flexible in order for their firm to survive,\u201d said Arthur McArdle, the FMB\u2019s national president. \u201cHowever, this strategy is not without risk, as if construction bosses are employing more subbies, they might not always be certain of their quality. Rebalancing the workforce may seem like a good idea at the time, but it could lead to reputation-damaging mistakes.\u201d Another body, the Home Builders Federation (HBF). meanwhile. said however that delays in the planning process and a lack of available land were of more concern at the moment to its members, who account for 80% of all new homes built in England and Wales. Buyer confidence was cited in March as a major constraint by only 7% of members of the Home Builders Federation (HBF), well down on the 48% who said it was a challenge of a similar scale at the end of last year. Stockpiling, which has been taking place in other sectors ahead of Brexit, is meanwhile less of an indicator in the building trade.

Roads around the Spanish capital were flooded, flights diverted from Barajas airport and underground services affected on Monday night as an isolated depression at high levels moved across the centre of the Iberian peninsula. The skies over Madrid were lit up by more than 9,300 bolts of lightning, according to Spain\u2019s state meteorological office, Aemet. One of the worst-hit areas was the satellite town of Arganda del Rey, where cars and rubbish bins were carried away by the torrents and residents used shovels to clear roads and pavements of drifts of hail. Aemet said the town had experienced 46.4 litres of rainfall per square metre as the storms rolled in. Arganda\u2019s underground station remained closed on Tuesday morning and the council set up a centre to help those affected by the floods. On Monday night, Isabel D\u00edaz Ayuso, the president of the Madrid region, said firefighters had dealt with more than 200 incidents and asked people to take care. Madrid\u2019s emergency services said they had been called to 1,134 incidents between 4pm and 9pm on Monday and had worked to clear trees and branches from roads and deal with flood waters and inundated garages and basements. Aemet said the cold front was moving eastwards, and placed Valencia, Alicante, Murcia and the Balearics on orange alert. \u201cThings remain unclear, but we expect the isolated depression at high levels to continue its progress east, bringing rain and uncertainty to a large part of the peninsula and the Balearics,\u201d it said. \u201cStrong or very strong and persistent squalls and storms are likely in the Valencia region, Murcia and the western part of the Balearics.\u201d Aemet said the stormy weather would continue until Wednesday morning, when the depression would move towards northern Italy. An Aemet spokesman said that while such a weather phenomenon was more commonly seen in the autumn months, it did sometimes bring hail and heavy rain in August. \u201cWhat happened yesterday is that the Madrid area, which bore the brunt of it, isn\u2019t a region that\u2019s very accustomed to these levels of precipitation,\u201d Rub\u00e9n del Campo said. \u201cIt\u2019s normally the Mediterranean regions that get the most torrential rain.

      "body": "<p><br>It\u2019s an hour after Jordan Brookes\u2019s life changed, and we\u2019re sitting in a cafe yards from where he just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/24/jordan-brookes-edinburgh-comedy-awards-catherine-cohen-jessica-brough\">collected the 2019 Edinburgh Comedy award</a>. He\u2019s still buzzing, obviously. \u201cPeople talk about it being a weird out-of-body experience when you hear your name announced. I genuinely couldn\u2019t believe I\u2019d won.\u201d He was selected for his part-improvised show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/17/jordan-brookes-review-pleasance-courtyard-edinburgh\">I\u2019ve Got Nothing</a>. Stephen Fry, a winner of the first such award in 1981, presented the trophy, which comes with a cash prize of \u00a310,000.</p> <p>It\u2019s the cash that might \u2013 in the short term \u2013 make the biggest impact. Usually, Brookes returns to London in September and looks for a full-time job. It might be in a shoe shop, behind a bar \u2013 or in the line of work that generated Sunday\u2019s headlines (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/24/ex-call-centre-worker-wins-top-edinburgh-comedy-award\">\u201cEx-call centre worker wins top award\u201d</a>) after he claimed the prize. \u201cI don\u2019t come from money or from any sort of privilege,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve always needed a secondary income to survive.\u201d That may change now, after joining a <a href=\"http://www.comedyawards.co.uk/best-comedy-show\">roll-call</a> that includes Frank Skinner, Steve Coogan, Hannah Gadsby, and last year\u2019s champ <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/aug/03/comedian-rose-matafeo-sassy-best-friend-edinburgh\">Rose Matafeo</a>, who is soon to star \u2013 it was announced this month \u2013 in <a href=\"https://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2019/08/12/43970/bbc_confirms_rose_matafeo_comedy\">her own BBC sitcom</a>.</p> <p>Or it may not. The award \u201cis still hugely revered,\u201d says Brookes, 33, \u201cbut the outcome is not as stratospheric as it used to be\u201d. This is the first of several double-edged remarks about the ex-Perrier award made by its new champion. He \u201cgauges [his] success\u201d, he says, \u201cby continuing to enjoy what I\u2019m doing. Anything beyond that, it\u2019s ludicrous to get caught up in.\u201d</p> <p>That opinion may not be unrelated to what Brookes tells me about the origin of his comedy career \u2013 which in turn filters into the dark, destabilising work that secured him the award. After the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/aug/24/jordan-brookes-review-pleasance-edinburgh-festival\">giddyingly disruptive Body of Work</a> (nominated in 2017) and its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/aug/06/jordan-brookes-review-pleasance-courtyard-edinburgh-festival\">hi-tech follow-up Bleed,</a> I\u2019ve Got Nothing is Brookes\u2019s lightest offering, an off-the-cuff(ish) set that\u2019s been called \u201ca standup Waiting for Godot\u201d. The conceit is that Brookes has \u201cgot nothing\u201d, that he\u2019s just killing time until something happens that he can fashion into comedy. In fact, he\u2019s prepped 35 minutes of material to weave in, about his self-hatred, the end of the world, and seducing his mum. He\u2019s also got a startling set-piece mocking the sincere thanks with which comics often conclude their shows.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Why can\u2019t comedy encompass that weird contradiction of being happy and sad, wanting to live and wanting to die?</p> <footer> <cite>Jordan Brookes</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The irony is not lost on Brookes that comedy\u2019s most illustrious prize has gone to a show that (in his words) \u201cdoesn\u2019t exist\u201d. But it was one he needed to make.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s an hour after Jordan Brookes\u2019s life changed, and we\u2019re sitting in a cafe yards from where he just collected the 2019 Edinburgh Comedy award. He\u2019s still buzzing, obviously. \u201cPeople talk about it being a weird out-of-body experience when you hear your name announced. I genuinely couldn\u2019t believe I\u2019d won.\u201d He was selected for his part-improvised show I\u2019ve Got Nothing. Stephen Fry, a winner of the first such award in 1981, presented the trophy, which comes with a cash prize of \u00a310,000. It\u2019s the cash that might \u2013 in the short term \u2013 make the biggest impact. Usually, Brookes returns to London in September and looks for a full-time job. It might be in a shoe shop, behind a bar \u2013 or in the line of work that generated Sunday\u2019s headlines (\u201cEx-call centre worker wins top award\u201d) after he claimed the prize. \u201cI don\u2019t come from money or from any sort of privilege,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve always needed a secondary income to survive.\u201d That may change now, after joining a roll-call that includes Frank Skinner, Steve Coogan, Hannah Gadsby, and last year\u2019s champ Rose Matafeo, who is soon to star \u2013 it was announced this month \u2013 in her own BBC sitcom. Or it may not. The award \u201cis still hugely revered,\u201d says Brookes, 33, \u201cbut the outcome is not as stratospheric as it used to be\u201d. This is the first of several double-edged remarks about the ex-Perrier award made by its new champion. He \u201cgauges [his] success\u201d, he says, \u201cby continuing to enjoy what I\u2019m doing. Anything beyond that, it\u2019s ludicrous to get caught up in.\u201d That opinion may not be unrelated to what Brookes tells me about the origin of his comedy career \u2013 which in turn filters into the dark, destabilising work that secured him the award. After the giddyingly disruptive Body of Work (nominated in 2017) and its hi-tech follow-up Bleed, I\u2019ve Got Nothing is Brookes\u2019s lightest offering, an off-the-cuff(ish) set that\u2019s been called \u201ca standup Waiting for Godot\u201d. The conceit is that Brookes has \u201cgot nothing\u201d, that he\u2019s just killing time until something happens that he can fashion into comedy. In fact, he\u2019s prepped 35 minutes of material to weave in, about his self-hatred, the end of the world, and seducing his mum. He\u2019s also got a startling set-piece mocking the sincere thanks with which comics often conclude their shows. The irony is not lost on Brookes that comedy\u2019s most illustrious prize has gone to a show that (in his words) \u201cdoesn\u2019t exist\u201d. But it was one he needed to make. Partly as a reaction against Bleed \u2013 which was broadcast to its audience via binaural headphones, and \u201cwas incredibly hard work and I came out very stressed,\u201d he says. And partly because of \u201chow I was feeling at the time,\u201d he adds, \u201cwhich was: I don\u2019t know what to do with my life, I don\u2019t know where to turn, I don\u2019t feel safe, ever. So I thought: why not explore that on stage? That sense of there being no real hope. Let\u2019s watch a human being deal with that for an hour in a weird way.\u201d I\u2019ve Got Nothing, then, is a play on words \u2013 from a performer with no script, and an artist with (he felt) no clear plan, no hope, no future. In that latter sense, it\u2019s consistent with all Brookes\u2019s work, in which his depressive, distracted inner monologue interrupts or infects whatever is happening on stage. \u201cI always wanted my work to reflect where people are at their darkest,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy can\u2019t comedy encompass that weird contradiction of being happy and sad, wanting to live and wanting to die, feeling joyful and feeling sorrowful? Why can\u2019t it be all of those things all at once? Why can\u2019t it be confronting us with this stuff and also distracting us from it?\u201d Brookes\u2019 work does just that \u2013 which is just one of the ways in which he restlessly subverts your expectations of a standup show.He doesn\u2019t use a microphone, he dresses like a castaway (barefoot, in shorts and a button-down shirt), and he doesn\u2019t respect the audience\u2019s personal space.

      "bodyText": "The Guardian has today launched a new competition for emerging artists, with the winner receiving a paid commission to design illustrations for the Guardian\u2019s presence at Glastonbury festival 2020. The Guardian is one of Glastonbury\u2019s media partners \u2013 covering the festival in-depth and having an onsite presence selling newspapers, and helping festival-goers navigate their experience with the mini-guide. As part of this, an illustrator is commissioned to create how the Guardian looks at the festival, including at various points of sale around the site and the artwork on the Guardian\u2019s Glastonbury canvas bag. This year, the Guardian is opening this up to support emerging talent, providing an opportunity for an aspiring artist to play a part in one of the UK\u2019s biggest cultural celebrations. To enter, applicants are invited to complete an online form and submit examples of previous work. The entries will be judged by a panel of top creative professionals to determine a shortlist of at least ten. The shortlisted candidates will be asked to create a rough concept for one of the Guardian\u2019s Glastonbury canvas bags inspired by the theme of hope and will each receive \u00a3200 for their work. All shortlisted entrants will also receive feedback on their artwork. The judges will then assess the shortlisted entries based on everything submitted so far and select three favourites, who will be interviewed for the final stage. The winner will be announced in November. Kate Davies, Head of brand and awareness, Guardian News &amp; Media said: \u201cThe Guardian is proud to be a long-standing media partner with Glastonbury. The festival is a musical and cultural celebration unlike any other, so we are thrilled to be able to launch this opportunity and provide a platform for an aspiring illustrator to create the look-and-feel of the Guardian\u2019s presence at Glastonbury festival\u2019s 50th anniversary.\u201d The competition is open from today (27 August) until 11 October, while social media users can post and stay up to date online using the hashtag #DrawTheGuardian. The competition is open to under-represented artists at early stages in their careers. Applicants must be a UK resident and be over the age of 18. Full terms and conditions here. -Ends- Notes to editors About Guardian News &amp; Media Guardian News &amp; Media (GNM) publishes theguardian.com, one of the world\u2019s leading English-language newspaper websites.

      "bodyText": "Opposition politicians in South Africa are calling for a \u201cthorough and transparent\u201d investigation into a car crash that killed a controversial South African businessman accused of bribing dozens of top government officials. Gavin Watson, 71, died when his Toyota Corolla hit a concrete bridge support in Johannesburg in the early hours of Monday morning as he was travelling alone to the city\u2019s international airport. Watson\u2019s company has been at the centre of a judicial investigation into allegations of systematic graft that implicate scores of leading figures in the African National Congress (ANC) party, which has been in power since the end of the apartheid regime 25 years ago. South Africa has faced a series of corruption scandals in recent years. Jacob Zuma was forced to step down as president in February last year after widespread allegations of wrongdoing, which he denies. Revelations of graft have badly damaged the country\u2019s international standing, undermined investor sentiment and destabilised politics. People within the deeply divided ANC have sought to use multiple inquiries to discredit opponents and derail reform. The judicial investigation has heard testimony from whistleblowers alleging Watson\u2019s logistics company, Bosasa, paid millions of dollars to officials in exchange for lucrative government contracts. Former executives have said about $5m (\u00a34m) was paid in bribes and some state officials received monthly payments. Others were given cash in Louis Vuitton handbags, Cartier pens, cars and houses, and free security equipment, and had school fees paid for their children. One was sent luxury food deliveries over Christmas. A video surfaced in January that apparently showed Watson counting out huge sums in cash to be handed over as bribes. Cyril Ramaphosa, the president, who was elected on the promise that he would sweep away corruption, was forced to admit unwittingly accepting a donation from Watson in his campaign to unseat his predecessor. Bosasa also paid Ramaphosa\u2019s son Andile a consulting fee for \u201cadvisory services\u201d. Watson was due to testify at a separate inquiry into his tax affairs this week. Police have opened a case for culpable homicide, an offence similar to manslaughter in British law. No reasons have been given for the decision. Solly Malatsi, a spokesman for the Democratic Alliance, the biggest opposition party, said Watson\u2019s death would hinder the graft investigation. \u201cIt is vital \u2026 that even a whiff of foul play is dispelled. This is to ensure that other witnesses are not intimated by this incident and for the commission of inquiry to conduct its work without fear or favour,\u201d he said. Leaders of the radical leftwing Economic Freedom Fighters suggested Watson had been killed to stop him giving evidence to South Africa\u2019s anti-corruption ombudsman, Busisiwe Mkhwebane. Watson\u2019s decision to leave his BMW SUV parked in the basement of the Bosasa offices and use a more modest vehicle has also fuelled suspicions of foul play. One whistleblower said it was \u201cvery plausible\u201d that Watson may have been trying to flee the country. \u201cIf you consider the charges that would come against him, I mean, it would be very plausible,\u201d said Angelo Agrizzi, a former Bosasa executive. Watson comes from a family known for its role in the anti-apartheid movement and is the oldest of four brothers who broke apartheid laws to play rugby with black people. They also joined the banned ANC, facing repeated arrest and detention. The family owned a highly successful chain of menswear shops and became power brokers in both politics and business as the apartheid regime crumbled in the early 1990s. Bosasa garnered contracts worth $140m from the state between 2000 and 2016, providing services ranging from prison catering to fleet management and information technology. James-Brent Styan, the co-author of the book The Bosasa Billions, told a local news website that Watson\u2019s death would have an \u201cimmense\u201d impact. \u201cIt is known that Watson didn\u2019t keep notes or records.

Britain\u2019s big accountancy firms have been criticised by politicians and regulators over lax auditing of companies, anticompetitive practices and conflicts of interest. Scrutiny of the firms increased after a string of corporate collapses including Carillion and BHS \u2013 companies which had been given a clean bill of health by their auditors. Deloitte and its big rivals PricewaterhouseCoopers, KPMG and EY dominate the market for auditing Britain\u2019s largest companies and have used those relationships to sell more profitable consultancy services. Deloitte last year generated \u00a3582m of revenue from audit work, \u00a3952m from consulting, and \u00a3862m for tax and legal services. In April this year the Competition and Markets Authority stopped short of calling for the big four to be broken up after a review of \u201cserious competition problems\u201d. Its final report called for them to put greater distance between their audit work and more lucrative consultancy operations to prevent conflicts of interest, but also warned the businesses it would look again at forcing them to break apart if the profession did not improve in the next five years.

And suddenly, there they all were. Hand in hand, chanting slogans and singing songs. On 23 August, the 30th anniversary of the Baltic Way \u2013 a human chain linking the capitals of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania to demand the Baltic republics\u2019 independence from the Soviet Union \u2013 more than <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3024169/demonstrators-offer-sparkling-visions-unity-human-chains\" title=\"\">200,000</a> people came out on to the streets of Hong Kong to form the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/23/hong-kong-protesters-join-hands-in-30-mile-human-chain\" title=\"\">Hong Kong Way</a>\u201d. From the crowded streets of Wan Chai on Hong Kong island, to the famous waterfront of Tsim Sha Tsui, to the suburbs of the New Territories, to the peak of Lion Rock, people linked hands in a continuous human chain that some said measured <a href=\"http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Hong-Kong-Way:-a-60km-human-chain-for-freedom-(Photo-and-Video)-47825.html\" title=\"\">60km</a> in total.</p> \n<p>This was just the latest action in Hong Kong\u2019s ongoing anti-government protest movement calling for democratic reforms. As a protest action, it was incredibly effective: entirely peaceful, a striking visual spectacle, and a very physical manifestation of the broad support for the movement from across the community. People of all ages and from all walks of life, families with young children, the elderly \u2013 all joined the chain and put paid to any suggestion that these ongoing protests were just a few hot-headed young student agitators. But perhaps most importantly, the Hong Kong Way created a moment of enchantment.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/14/beijing-tactics-crush-hong-kong-protests\">Beijing\u2019s game plan for stifling the Hong Kong protests is now clear | Sebastian Veg</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It was a sharp contrast to the scenes of the weekend that followed: violent clashes between protesters and police on two consecutive days, which culminated in police deploying water cannon for the first time on Hong Kong\u2019s streets and one officer firing a warning shot from his service revolver to fend off an angry mob police said threatened their lives. As the city continues to reel from months of protests, moments of enchantment such as Friday night\u2019s Hong Kong Way offer a reprieve from the escalating cycle of violence and rays of hope for the protest movement.</p> \n<p>The feeling of \u201cenchantment\u201d, according to political theorist <a href=\"https://politicalscience.jhu.edu/directory/jane-bennett/\" title=\"\">Jane Bennett</a> of Johns Hopkins University, is something that stops you in your tracks, leaving you transfixed and spellbound \u2013 a suspension of time and movement. Places or moments of enchantment can inspire a sense of wonder or awe, even fill us with overwhelming feelings of generosity and love for the world. But enchantment can also serve a political purpose.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"bbbc2ac4-18c2-42d8-bdf1-f8ee5b4ad845\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/T_heym4ghXI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Today\u2019s Hong Kong feels overwhelmed by the forces of disenchantment. The ongoing protests have drawn upon a deep-seated malaise, with a population that feels they are stuck with a leader they didn\u2019t choose, running a government that doesn\u2019t listen to them, in a city whose housing they cannot afford and with wages and an economy that are going nowhere. Many of those who can leave are actively planning to do so.

      "bodyText": "It almost felt like magic. A few people standing on the street were joined by a few more; people lining the footpath of one block connected to those on the next block. And suddenly, there they all were. Hand in hand, chanting slogans and singing songs. On 23 August, the 30th anniversary of the Baltic Way \u2013 a human chain linking the capitals of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania to demand the Baltic republics\u2019 independence from the Soviet Union \u2013 more than 200,000 people came out on to the streets of Hong Kong to form the \u201cHong Kong Way\u201d. From the crowded streets of Wan Chai on Hong Kong island, to the famous waterfront of Tsim Sha Tsui, to the suburbs of the New Territories, to the peak of Lion Rock, people linked hands in a continuous human chain that some said measured 60km in total. This was just the latest action in Hong Kong\u2019s ongoing anti-government protest movement calling for democratic reforms. As a protest action, it was incredibly effective: entirely peaceful, a striking visual spectacle, and a very physical manifestation of the broad support for the movement from across the community. People of all ages and from all walks of life, families with young children, the elderly \u2013 all joined the chain and put paid to any suggestion that these ongoing protests were just a few hot-headed young student agitators. But perhaps most importantly, the Hong Kong Way created a moment of enchantment. It was a sharp contrast to the scenes of the weekend that followed: violent clashes between protesters and police on two consecutive days, which culminated in police deploying water cannon for the first time on Hong Kong\u2019s streets and one officer firing a warning shot from his service revolver to fend off an angry mob police said threatened their lives. As the city continues to reel from months of protests, moments of enchantment such as Friday night\u2019s Hong Kong Way offer a reprieve from the escalating cycle of violence and rays of hope for the protest movement. The feeling of \u201cenchantment\u201d, according to political theorist Jane Bennett of Johns Hopkins University, is something that stops you in your tracks, leaving you transfixed and spellbound \u2013 a suspension of time and movement. Places or moments of enchantment can inspire a sense of wonder or awe, even fill us with overwhelming feelings of generosity and love for the world. But enchantment can also serve a political purpose. Today\u2019s Hong Kong feels overwhelmed by the forces of disenchantment. The ongoing protests have drawn upon a deep-seated malaise, with a population that feels they are stuck with a leader they didn\u2019t choose, running a government that doesn\u2019t listen to them, in a city whose housing they cannot afford and with wages and an economy that are going nowhere. Many of those who can leave are actively planning to do so. Others appear to be caught in a despair that has driven them out on to the streets in the increasingly desperate protests. As Bennett argues, it is hard to love a disenchanted city. Sites or moments of enchantment, such as the Hong Kong Way, offer a solution to Hong Kong\u2019s political and social ennui, helping to lift the fog of cynicism and disenchantment, and encouraging hope and engagement in civic life. Hong Kong\u2019s activists have long had an ability to capture this sense of enchantment: sites such as the colourful Lennon walls, which have blossomed across the pedestrian underpasses and footbridges of the city in recent months, or the vibrant tent city of 2014\u2019s Umbrella Movement; moments such as the annual 4 June candlelit vigils held to commemorate Tiananmen Square, through to the solemn lawyers\u2019 silent marches, a deeply moving expression of a legal profession in mourning for the city\u2019s rule of law. In response, Beijing and the Hong Kong government have tried to exhort the population to \u201cLove Hong Kong\u201d by deploying crude propaganda and economic bribes, such as financial secretary Paul Chan\u2019s \u201cmini-budget\u201d of recent weeks which purported to relieve the economic stress of the protests by offering residents the equivalent of a few hundred pounds\u2019 worth of subsidies. The government seems to fail to understand that this is not a battle that will be won in dollars and cents or through crude force. It needs to enchant the people if it wants to compete. Activists around the world may also wish to take note: in the battle against governments for hearts and minds, enchantment may be their most powerful weapon. \u2022 Antony Dapiran is a Hong Kong-based writer and lawyer",

This would keep the Good Friday agreement intact.</p>\n    <p>Both the UK and EU signed up to the basic idea in December 2017 as part of the initial Brexit deal, but there have been disagreements since on how it would work.</p>\n    <p>The DUP have objected to it, as it potentially treats Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK, creating a customs divide in the Irish Sea, which is anathema to the unionist party.</p>\n    <p>Hardline Tory Eurosceptics also object to it, as they perceive it to be a trap that could potentially lock the UK into the EU\u2019s customs union permanently if the UK &amp; EU cannot seal a free trade agreement. That would prevent the UK from doing its own free trade deals with nations outside the bloc.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was added to May\u2019s withdrawal agreement?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Joint interpretative instrument&nbsp;</b><br></p>\n    <p>A legal add-on to the withdrawal agreement was given to Theresa May in January 2019 to try to get her deal through the UK parliament. It gives legal force to a letter from Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk, the presidents of the commission and council. This stated the EU\u2019s intention to negotiate an alternative to the backstop so it would not be triggered, or, if it was triggered, to get out of it as quickly as possible.</p>\n    <p><b>Unilateral statement from the UK&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>This set out the British position that, if the backstop were to become permanent and talks on an alternative were going nowhere, the UK believes it would be able to exit the arrangement.</p>\n    <p><b>Additional language in political declaration&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>This emphasises the urgency felt on both sides to negotiate an alternative to the backstop, and flesh out what a technological fix would look like.

The prime minister spoke to the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, later on Tuesday. A Downing Street source said that there was still not a substantive \u201copenness to action\u201d despite a \u201cshift in rhetoric\u201d from EU leaders. No 10 believes the EU27 must consider whether to approve a new negotiating mandate, something hinted at by Juncker in his call with Johnson. \u201cThat would be a sign they are serious about this,\u201d one source said. Johnson will send his chief Brexit adviser, David Frost, to Brussels on Wednesday to continue discussions on alternatives to the backstop with senior EU officials, though No 10 played down the prospect of Frost presenting a concrete proposal for the reopening of negotiations. Johnson is expected to meet Ireland\u2019s taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, in Dublin early next week, a meeting which a Downing Street source described as \u201cclearly crucial\u201d. Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, started a five-city Brexit tour of EU capitals on Tuesday to reinforce the importance of the backstop and Good Friday agreement for Ireland\u2019s economic and social stability. Coveney\u2019s EU offensive on the backstop would appear to counter some claims that the EU is showing new signs of flexibility on the measure after Johnson\u2019s first appearance at a G7 summit, in Biarritz at the weekend. Speaking in Dublin before the trip and before a meeting with his Norwegian counterpart on Monday night, Coveney spoke of a diplomatic outreach programme to help other nations understand the \u201cunique\u201d impact of Brexit on the island of Ireland. He also spoke of \u201cthe complex constitutional arrangements in Northern Ireland, the experiences of border communities in the past, and the interwoven nature of relationships on the island [that] can be best understood by a visit to the area\u201d. Coveney is expected to repeat this message in Prague on Tuesday, in Paris on Wednesday, in Helsinki on Thursday and Friday, and in Warsaw on Sunday. Last week in Dublin, Coveney said it was not the case that the Irish government was refusing to talk to the UK, but said he would not be facilitating the UK in walking away from its commitments in the withdrawal agreement. Johnson also spoke to the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, by phone on Tuesday. Rutte said he told Johnson that the EU27 was \u201copen to concrete proposals compatible with the withdrawal agreement: respect for the integrity of the single market and no hard border on the Irish isle\u201d. A Downing Street spokeswoman said there had been \u201cgood discussions with EU leaders both last week in France and in Germany, and at the weekend\u201d. The spokeswoman said Johnson believed there was now a \u201cclear understanding\u201d of the seriousness of the UK\u2019s commitment to leave on 31 October. \u201cHe has also been setting out very clearly the reasons why the backstop is unacceptable to us,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cWhat is clear is that if there is goodwill on both sides, and a determination to get things done, solutions to the backstop exist and the PM believes they should be discussed.\u201d Frost is expected to meet officials from the EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier\u2019s taskforce as well as officials from the office of Donald Tusk, the president of the European council. \u201cThe discussions at sherpa level have been going on for a number of weeks now and those will continue this week, both in relation to the visit to Brussels and in the prime minister\u2019s own conversations with leaders which will carry on this week,\u201d a No 10 spokeswoman said. Securing changes to the backstop may not be enough to convince some of the Conservative hard Brexiters, though Downing Street has in effect ruled out any other changes. Iain Duncan Smith, who chaired Johnson\u2019s leadership campaign, wrote in the Telegraph on Tuesday that \u201csimply ditching the backstop isn\u2019t enough\u201d and said there were also concerns over the transition period and cooperation on defence and security. Asked whether Johnson was willing to accept the existing withdrawal agreement if the backstop is removed, the Downing Street spokeswoman said: \u201cWe have been clear the changes we are seeking are to the backstop.\u201d",

Exiting Westbourne Park station, revellers are welcomed to Leamington Road Villas by the bass line of the <strong>Sir Lloyd</strong> sound system, which has been a carnival fixture for 40 years.

      "bodyText": "Calypso, soca, steelpan and the masquerade (mas) bands have been key elements of the Notting Hill carnival since it began in 1966. It wasn\u2019t until 1973 that carnival architect Leslie Palmer officially invited stationary sound systems \u2013 first brought to the UK from Jamaica \u2013 to join the celebrations. and the event took on its noted street-party feel. Palmer wanted to attract a larger, younger crowd, because back then funding was directly linked to turnout. Still, Palmer probably wouldn\u2019t have imagined that, almost 50 years later, carnival would feature more than 30 sound systems. Some have cult status, while others bring out new British talent to perform on the mic. Exiting Westbourne Park station, revellers are welcomed to Leamington Road Villas by the bass line of the Sir Lloyd sound system, which has been a carnival fixture for 40 years. Dedicated to classic carnival sounds that reach back four decades, Sir Lloyd attracts an eclectic mix of people. On a road nearby, Benji B\u2019s colourful Deviation attracts a slightly younger crowd. Further into the carnival on Portobello Road is Gladdy Wax Roadshow, a reggae sound system that has been around even longer than Sir Lloyd\u2019s. A don of the London reggae scene, Gladwin Wright\u2019s system was a spinoff from Wax Unlimited record shop in Stoke Newington, which he ran for 14 years. The clouds of smoke floating up from the nearby barbecues, along with the older men skanking in the street with joints in hand to an impressive collection of reggae, seem to push Portobello Road back in time. Virgo International brings things closer to the present day: with its Vybz Kartel-heavy playlist, it proves to be one of the best spots away from the main parade to catch a whine as strangers find themselves pressed together thanks to the vast crowds. The cool corner of carnival is arguably around Colville Square and Colville Terrace, home to some of the best-dressed young carnival-goers. Not technically a sound system, the Inklusive Sound stage at Powis Square has a youthful edge, offering a solid serving of new afro bashment and dancehall, while around the corner Rampage is locked in one street with a similarly adventurous energy: artists including the godfather of grime, Wiley, along with Party Hard rapper Donae\u2019o and dancehall singer Kranium grace the stage, inciting mosh pits as temperatures hit the 30s. People\u2019s Sound, meanwhile, lives up to its name by giving the people what they want: ska pumps out of the speakers, slowing the movement of the sweating bodies. They still get people doing the electric slide, which is nothing short of a miracle given the heat \u2013 not to mention a fitting metaphor for Notting Hill carnival and the sound systems that are still a vision of unity 50-plus years on.",

However, Farage also sketched out another scenario, one in which he said the prime minister \u201cwas to summon up the courage\u201d to proceed with a no-deal Brexit on 31 October but where the only means of achieving it was to call a general election. \u201cIn those circumstances, if Boris Johnson is prepared to do the right thing to win out independence then we are prepared to do the right thing,\u201d he added, before his words were drowned out. Farage said the Brexit party might then be prepared to work with him, \u201cperhaps in the form of a non-aggression pact\u201d.

      "body": "<p>John Farmer, who describes himself as an activist shareholder, is a man with a mission \u2013 to save Britain\u2019s red phone boxes. These were once a feature of every high street in the country, but now number only 10,000 or so (and half of those are decorative rather than operational). At the recent annual general meeting of British Telecom, which even in the age of the mobile phone has a statutory obligation to maintain a payphone network, Farmer demanded that more be done to maintain the traditional red boxes. It was a point he has made at past AGMs \u2013 always, he says, to audience applause.</p> <p>In 2015 the traditional red phone box was voted <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/top-25-british-designs-revealed-the-iconic-red-phone-box-is-voted-nations-favourite-10111569.html\" title=\"\">the greatest British design of all time</a>, ahead of the Routemaster bus, the Spitfire, the union jack and Concorde. It was designed in 1924 by the architect <a href=\"https://gilbertscott.org/sir-giles-gilbert-scott/\" title=\"\">Sir Giles Gilbert Scott</a>, whose other creations include Liverpool\u2019s Anglican cathedral and Battersea and Bankside power stations. Many believe Scott\u2019s design echoes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/nov/23/sir-john-soane-how-tomb-for-architects-wife-inspired-the-red-telephone-box\" title=\"\">the tomb that the architect Sir John Soane built for his wife</a> in 1815.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Telephone-Boxes-Chatto-curiosities-Gavin/dp/070113366X\" title=\"\">his 1989 monograph on phone boxes</a>, the architectural historian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/07/gavin-stamp-obituary\" title=\"\">Gavin Stamp</a> called Scott\u2019s cast-iron box \u201ca classical design of refined sophistication and timeless elegance\u201d. Stamp was <a href=\"https://www.paul-mellon-centre.ac.uk/about/news/gavin-stamp-remembered/page/1\" title=\"\">a great enthusiast for Scott\u2019s boxes</a> and led a campaign to preserve them after they ceased production in 1968.</p> <p>In his book he lauds Scott\u2019s original design, designated Kiosk No 2 (usually abbreviated to K2) by the General Post Office, which was then responsible for the phone network. \u201cThe Kiosk No 2 was a miniature building,\u201d he writes. Scott\u2019s K2 design, easily identified by its small, square windows, was superseded in 1936 by his K6, which was smaller and had larger, horizontal windows to let more light into the box. The K2 had never caught on outside London because it was expensive, but the cheaper K6 was adopted nationally and by the late 1960s, when the utilitarian K8 was introduced, designed by the architect Bruce Martin, there were more than 70,000 in use across the country.</p> <p>There are still numerous Scott kiosks in central London, many of which have been listed as historically or architecturally significant \u2013 a response to the destruction of many boxes by the newly formed British Telecom in the 1980s. Remarkably Scott\u2019s original wooden prototype <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/k2-telephone-boxes\" title=\"\">still stands outside the Royal Academy in Piccadilly</a>. Across the UK, <a href=\"https://theculturetrip.com/europe/united-kingdom/england/london/articles/london-icons-the-red-telephone-box/\" title=\"\">more than 3,000 kiosks have been listed</a>, including all the K2s, so there is no danger of them disappearing from Britain\u2019s streets. Neil Scoresby, BT\u2019s general manager for payphones, tells me a revolution in payphones is under way, reflecting the fact that only about 30,000 calls a day are now made from them. Over the next decade, most of the current 31,000 street kiosks (they are mostly ugly, post-Scott designs) will be swept away and replaced by three metre-tall <a href=\"https://www.inlinkuk.com\" title=\"\">InLink pillars</a> and other devices that combine free calls with wi-fi services and are funded by advertising, but about 2,500 red boxes will be retained and converted for digital use.</p> <p>The fact there were once more than 70,000 red kiosks and now only 10,000 remain on the streets suggests that a lot of boxes have disappeared. In the 1970s and 80s, many were melted down, but gradually aficionados such as Stamp fought back and the boxes\u2019 aesthetic (and indeed monetary) value started to be recognised. Since 2008, rather than remove decommissioned ones that have not been listed, BT has allowed local councils and charities to repurpose them under its <a href=\"https://business.bt.com/campaigns/communities/adopt-a-kiosk/\" title=\"\">adopt-a-kiosk scheme</a>. More than 5,000 have been adopted.</p> <p>Many now contain defibrillators, with the <a href=\"https://www.communityheartbeat.org.uk\" title=\"\">Community Heartbeat Trust</a> leading the way in advising local authorities on conversion. The trust has adopted 1,300 boxes, more than half of which have been converted to house defibrillators. </p> <p>Other uses for the boxes are rich and varied. Book-swap points that double as miniature libraries are popular. The village of Marton cum Grafton in North Yorkshire was one of the pioneers, <a href=\"https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/8409499.marton-cum-grafton-residents-use-british-telecoms-adopt-a-kiosk-campaign-to-swap-books/\" title=\"\">opening a mini-library in 2010</a>; <a href=\"https://londonist.com/2016/05/the-story-of-london-s-smallest-library\" title=\"\">another was opened in the London borough of Lewisham</a> in 2013. I visited the latter and was impressed by the range of books. Not just airport fodder, but novels by Orhan Pamuk and Henning Mankell, an ancient book of English poetry and the catalogue of the <a href=\"http://www.mezipatra.cz/en/\" title=\"\">Mezipatra Queer film festival</a>, with text in Czech and English.</p> <p>The box was adopted by the Brockley Society and is now looked after by Susan Bennett and Tom Simpson, although Bennett says it is largely self-managing. People bring books in, take the odd one away and take it upon themselves to tidy up the seven shelves. The Lewisham \u201cmicrolibrary\u201d was started by the artist Sebastian Handley. He has now left the area, but the idea has been carried on. One thing that worried me about BT\u2019s adopt-a-kiosk scheme was whether some ideas might founder when the original volunteers moved on or lost their enthusiasm. By only allowing councils and charities, rather than individuals, to adopt, BT hopes to ensure continuity, but I still think there could be problems further down the line. Who will be looking after these boxes in 50 years\u2019 time, and making sure they get a fresh coat of \u201ccurrant-red\u201d paint?</p> <p>Art galleries in old phone boxes are also popular \u2013 an idea pioneered by the <a href=\"http://www.galleryonthegreen.org.uk/about/\" title=\"\">Gallery on the Green</a> in Settle, north Yorkshire, which is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year. \u201cA group of residents thought it would be a shame for the box to go, and the idea of a gallery came up,\u201d says Mike Smith, one of the half-dozen local people who keep it afloat. \u201cThe thought that it would probably be the smallest one in the world was kicked around and Guinness World Records was approached, but they said they weren\u2019t interested in definitively ruling on it, so the Carlsberg advert was used instead \u2026 probably the smallest one. That generated a lot of publicity at the time of the launch in 2009.\u201d</p> <p>Attempts have been made to monetise some boxes, in partnership with the <a href=\"https://www.redkioskcompany.co.uk\" title=\"\">Red Kiosk Company</a>, which has bought 124 boxes from BT under the adopt-a-box scheme (BT sells them for a nominal \u00a31, although it retains a residual interest in their use in an effort to ensure its brand is protected). The company gets planning permission for traders to use the boxes, and charges about \u00a3300 a month to rent a box.</p> <p>Mustafa Mehmet runs a coffee stall in a kiosk in Hampstead, north London. He originally did the same thing in west London, but says he was driven out by Hounslow council\u2019s insistence that he have a street traders\u2019 licence. The problem comes when kiosk traders spill over on to the pavement, which is almost inevitable \u2013 try selling coffee to a customer with both buyer and seller inside the box. Hounslow council, he says, insisted the transaction should take place inside the box; Camden council, under whose jurisdiction Mehmet is now trading, allows a bit of leeway.</p> <p>Phone repair company <a href=\"https://www.lovefone.co.uk\" title=\"\">Lovefone</a> has a kiosk in Holborn, central London, in which it repairs cracked iPhone screens. The Lovefone technician who works there, Fouad Choaibi, loves it. \u201cThis is my office,\u201d he says. He has been based in the box for two and a half years and has embedded himself in the community, making himself indispensable to locals with cracked iPhones. The kiosk is very profitable, proving it can be done if you get the concept right. But the high degree of churn in other kiosks suggests a lot of traders don\u2019t and quickly lose interest.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"87478ee3edd8fda38b5c7c96b5ff5e4d9562be6c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/87478ee3edd8fda38b5c7c96b5ff5e4d9562be6c/0_0_4928_3264/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fouad Choaibi at work in Holborn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fouad Choaibi at work in Holborn</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Leigh/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Next to the pier in Brighton, Senegal-born Abo Fall is selling hats, sunglasses and beachwear out of two adjacent boxes. He has been there for two years and is keeping his head above the waves, but he says it can be a struggle if the weather\u2019s bad. \u201cPeople like the boxes and it\u2019s different from an ordinary shop,\u201d he says. Wherever you see a red box, you will see someone taking a picture of it, although, as the traders know all too well, that doesn\u2019t automatically mean they will buy a coffee or a sunhat.</p> <p>Plenty of other quirky ideas have been tried, with music a fertile source. A box in the village of Meols, on the Wirral peninsula, has been turned into <a href=\"https://wirralview.com/news/omd-phone-box-connection-restored\" title=\"\">a miniature museum</a> dedicated to the band Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, who <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iItKShdHIDk\" title=\"\">used to make calls from the box</a> and immortalised it in the 1980 song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5N46p2aU68\" title=\"\">Red Frame/White Light</a>. And last year, to mark the 5,000th kiosk adoption, a box in Kingsbridge, Devon, was turned into what was somewhat hyperbolically termed <a href=\"http://www.southhams-today.co.uk/article.cfm?id=111956&amp;headline=%27Smallest%20Nightclub%20in%20the%20World%27%20opens%20for%20the%20first%20time&amp;sectionIs=news&amp;searchyear=2018\" title=\"\">\u201cthe world\u2019s smallest nightclub\u201d</a>. It is actually a way of raising money for a local charity. Visitors to the box can dial-a-disc for \u00a31. Musical offerings include Blondie\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWhkbDMISl8\" title=\"\">Hanging on the Telephone</a> and ELO\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77R1Wp6Y_5Y\" title=\"\">Telephone Line</a>.</p> <p>The boxes are also useful for stunts. In 2011, residents in the Cambridgeshire village of Shepreth <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-14103481\" title=\"\">opened a pub</a> (called the Dog and Bone, of course) in the local phone box to protest about the closure of their real local. The campaign seems to have paid off because that pub, <a href=\"http://www.theploughshepreth.co.uk\" title=\"\">the Plough</a>, reopened in 2014. Incredibly, I can find no evidence of any plays being performed in a phonebox at the Edinburgh festival. Next year I plan to give my Hamlet in a kiosk on the Royal Mile. Though this be madness, yet there is method in it.</p> <p>Individuals can also buy boxes that aren\u2019t listed and have no prospective adopter, so are being removed. A box in poor condition will set you back almost \u00a32,000 on eBay, or you can buy a refurbished K6 for \u00a32,750 (plus VAT and delivery) through BT\u2019s approved reseller <a href=\"http://www.x2connect.com/Home\" title=\"\">X2Connect</a>. <a href=\"https://www.unicornrestorations.com/kiosks\" title=\"\">Unicorn Restorations</a> also supplies beautifully restored boxes \u2013 at eye-watering prices if you want a rare K2 \u2013 drawing on stock it accumulated in the 1980s and 90s when unwanted and unloved red boxes were plentiful.</p> <p>\u201cWe supply boxes to private buyers and commercial organisations,\u201d says a director of X2Connect, Martin White. \u201cThey go all round the world. We\u2019ve done shopping malls in Florida and Dubai. They\u2019re very popular in Australia and America, but places in Europe take them as well. People put them in their gardens and companies have them in their offices. They buy them as birthday presents or just for themselves, telling us it\u2019s something they\u2019ve always wanted.\u201d White says that eventually the supply will dry up, but his company has enough to keep it going for a good few years yet.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3316263edf8dccea6289ccf04a5af3eec0ba6ea0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3316263edf8dccea6289ccf04a5af3eec0ba6ea0/0_0_4368_2912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A defibrillator phone box in the Lake District, Cumbria.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A defibrillator phone box in the Lake District, Cumbria.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Carrick</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The cult of the boxes is a strange and powerful one. The sculptor David Mach, who 30 years ago laid 12 of them end to end in the centre of Kingston upon Thames in a celebrated piece of public art called <a href=\"https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attraction_Review-g504175-d8535594-Reviews-Out_of_Order_by_David_Mach-Kingston_upon_Thames_Greater_London_England.html\" title=\"\">Out of Order</a>, describes them as a \u201cuniversal Great British thing\u201d. \u201cThe design is fantastic,\u201d he says, \u201cand then it seeps wholesale into the ground and comes back up through the soles of your feet.\u201d They have featured on a million postcards and, having been a central feature of British life for much of the 20th century, in many films. Tourists still go to the fishing village of Pennan in Aberdeenshire in search of the phone box that features prominently in the 1983 film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2015/mar/12/the-film-that-makes-me-cry-local-hero\" title=\"\">Local Hero</a>, not realising that the box used in the film was a wooden prop. Pennan does have <a href=\"https://www.thenational.scot/news/14849494.profile-the-local-hero-phone-box-in-need-of-rescue/\" title=\"\">a real box</a>, with a less perfect view of the sea than in the film, so visitors make do with that.</p> <p>Scott\u2019s kiosks are loved in part because they are redolent of a time when the British were willing to build a small house from which anyone could make a call. They represent civic pride and national confidence \u2013 both now in short supply. Farmer is horrified at my suggestion that we should just let them go. Objects have a use, so why keep them when they lose that use? He finds such iconoclasm detestable. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to become like the Americans,\u201d he says. By which I presume he means a throwaway society. But equally the veneration of the past can go too far. We surround Battersea power station with anodyne, absurdly pricey flats and tell ourselves we have rescued it, even though it has lost all its stark beauty.</p> <p>I wonder how Scott\u2019s K2s and K6s will look 50 years from now, when everyone has forgotten why they were ever there and thinks they were built as micro-libraries and art galleries, coffee kiosks and collection points. Or in 1,000 years when, as with Stonehenge, our descendants will ascribe some deep religious significance to them. Which, given the way they are now worshipped, might not be far from the truth.</p>",

      "bodyText": "John Farmer, who describes himself as an activist shareholder, is a man with a mission \u2013 to save Britain\u2019s red phone boxes. These were once a feature of every high street in the country, but now number only 10,000 or so (and half of those are decorative rather than operational). At the recent annual general meeting of British Telecom, which even in the age of the mobile phone has a statutory obligation to maintain a payphone network, Farmer demanded that more be done to maintain the traditional red boxes. It was a point he has made at past AGMs \u2013 always, he says, to audience applause. In 2015 the traditional red phone box was voted the greatest British design of all time, ahead of the Routemaster bus, the Spitfire, the union jack and Concorde. It was designed in 1924 by the architect Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, whose other creations include Liverpool\u2019s Anglican cathedral and Battersea and Bankside power stations. Many believe Scott\u2019s design echoes the tomb that the architect Sir John Soane built for his wife in 1815. In his 1989 monograph on phone boxes, the architectural historian Gavin Stamp called Scott\u2019s cast-iron box \u201ca classical design of refined sophistication and timeless elegance\u201d. Stamp was a great enthusiast for Scott\u2019s boxes and led a campaign to preserve them after they ceased production in 1968. In his book he lauds Scott\u2019s original design, designated Kiosk No 2 (usually abbreviated to K2) by the General Post Office, which was then responsible for the phone network. \u201cThe Kiosk No 2 was a miniature building,\u201d he writes. Scott\u2019s K2 design, easily identified by its small, square windows, was superseded in 1936 by his K6, which was smaller and had larger, horizontal windows to let more light into the box. The K2 had never caught on outside London because it was expensive, but the cheaper K6 was adopted nationally and by the late 1960s, when the utilitarian K8 was introduced, designed by the architect Bruce Martin, there were more than 70,000 in use across the country. There are still numerous Scott kiosks in central London, many of which have been listed as historically or architecturally significant \u2013 a response to the destruction of many boxes by the newly formed British Telecom in the 1980s. Remarkably Scott\u2019s original wooden prototype still stands outside the Royal Academy in Piccadilly. Across the UK, more than 3,000 kiosks have been listed, including all the K2s, so there is no danger of them disappearing from Britain\u2019s streets. Neil Scoresby, BT\u2019s general manager for payphones, tells me a revolution in payphones is under way, reflecting the fact that only about 30,000 calls a day are now made from them. Over the next decade, most of the current 31,000 street kiosks (they are mostly ugly, post-Scott designs) will be swept away and replaced by three metre-tall InLink pillars and other devices that combine free calls with wi-fi services and are funded by advertising, but about 2,500 red boxes will be retained and converted for digital use. The fact there were once more than 70,000 red kiosks and now only 10,000 remain on the streets suggests that a lot of boxes have disappeared. In the 1970s and 80s, many were melted down, but gradually aficionados such as Stamp fought back and the boxes\u2019 aesthetic (and indeed monetary) value started to be recognised. Since 2008, rather than remove decommissioned ones that have not been listed, BT has allowed local councils and charities to repurpose them under its adopt-a-kiosk scheme. More than 5,000 have been adopted. Many now contain defibrillators, with the Community Heartbeat Trust leading the way in advising local authorities on conversion. The trust has adopted 1,300 boxes, more than half of which have been converted to house defibrillators. Other uses for the boxes are rich and varied. Book-swap points that double as miniature libraries are popular. The village of Marton cum Grafton in North Yorkshire was one of the pioneers, opening a mini-library in 2010; another was opened in the London borough of Lewisham in 2013. I visited the latter and was impressed by the range of books. Not just airport fodder, but novels by Orhan Pamuk and Henning Mankell, an ancient book of English poetry and the catalogue of the Mezipatra Queer film festival, with text in Czech and English. The box was adopted by the Brockley Society and is now looked after by Susan Bennett and Tom Simpson, although Bennett says it is largely self-managing. People bring books in, take the odd one away and take it upon themselves to tidy up the seven shelves. The Lewisham \u201cmicrolibrary\u201d was started by the artist Sebastian Handley. He has now left the area, but the idea has been carried on. One thing that worried me about BT\u2019s adopt-a-kiosk scheme was whether some ideas might founder when the original volunteers moved on or lost their enthusiasm. By only allowing councils and charities, rather than individuals, to adopt, BT hopes to ensure continuity, but I still think there could be problems further down the line. Who will be looking after these boxes in 50 years\u2019 time, and making sure they get a fresh coat of \u201ccurrant-red\u201d paint? Art galleries in old phone boxes are also popular \u2013 an idea pioneered by the Gallery on the Green in Settle, north Yorkshire, which is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year. \u201cA group of residents thought it would be a shame for the box to go, and the idea of a gallery came up,\u201d says Mike Smith, one of the half-dozen local people who keep it afloat. \u201cThe thought that it would probably be the smallest one in the world was kicked around and Guinness World Records was approached, but they said they weren\u2019t interested in definitively ruling on it, so the Carlsberg advert was used instead \u2026 probably the smallest one. That generated a lot of publicity at the time of the launch in 2009.\u201d Attempts have been made to monetise some boxes, in partnership with the Red Kiosk Company, which has bought 124 boxes from BT under the adopt-a-box scheme (BT sells them for a nominal \u00a31, although it retains a residual interest in their use in an effort to ensure its brand is protected). The company gets planning permission for traders to use the boxes, and charges about \u00a3300 a month to rent a box. Mustafa Mehmet runs a coffee stall in a kiosk in Hampstead, north London. He originally did the same thing in west London, but says he was driven out by Hounslow council\u2019s insistence that he have a street traders\u2019 licence. The problem comes when kiosk traders spill over on to the pavement, which is almost inevitable \u2013 try selling coffee to a customer with both buyer and seller inside the box. Hounslow council, he says, insisted the transaction should take place inside the box; Camden council, under whose jurisdiction Mehmet is now trading, allows a bit of leeway. Phone repair company Lovefone has a kiosk in Holborn, central London, in which it repairs cracked iPhone screens. The Lovefone technician who works there, Fouad Choaibi, loves it. \u201cThis is my office,\u201d he says. He has been based in the box for two and a half years and has embedded himself in the community, making himself indispensable to locals with cracked iPhones. The kiosk is very profitable, proving it can be done if you get the concept right. But the high degree of churn in other kiosks suggests a lot of traders don\u2019t and quickly lose interest. Next to the pier in Brighton, Senegal-born Abo Fall is selling hats, sunglasses and beachwear out of two adjacent boxes. He has been there for two years and is keeping his head above the waves, but he says it can be a struggle if the weather\u2019s bad. \u201cPeople like the boxes and it\u2019s different from an ordinary shop,\u201d he says. Wherever you see a red box, you will see someone taking a picture of it, although, as the traders know all too well, that doesn\u2019t automatically mean they will buy a coffee or a sunhat. Plenty of other quirky ideas have been tried, with music a fertile source. A box in the village of Meols, on the Wirral peninsula, has been turned into a miniature museum dedicated to the band Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, who used to make calls from the box and immortalised it in the 1980 song Red Frame/White Light. And last year, to mark the 5,000th kiosk adoption, a box in Kingsbridge, Devon, was turned into what was somewhat hyperbolically termed \u201cthe world\u2019s smallest nightclub\u201d. It is actually a way of raising money for a local charity. Visitors to the box can dial-a-disc for \u00a31. Musical offerings include Blondie\u2019s Hanging on the Telephone and ELO\u2019s Telephone Line. The boxes are also useful for stunts. In 2011, residents in the Cambridgeshire village of Shepreth opened a pub (called the Dog and Bone, of course) in the local phone box to protest about the closure of their real local. The campaign seems to have paid off because that pub, the Plough, reopened in 2014. Incredibly, I can find no evidence of any plays being performed in a phonebox at the Edinburgh festival. Next year I plan to give my Hamlet in a kiosk on the Royal Mile. Though this be madness, yet there is method in it. Individuals can also buy boxes that aren\u2019t listed and have no prospective adopter, so are being removed. A box in poor condition will set you back almost \u00a32,000 on eBay, or you can buy a refurbished K6 for \u00a32,750 (plus VAT and delivery) through BT\u2019s approved reseller X2Connect. Unicorn Restorations also supplies beautifully restored boxes \u2013 at eye-watering prices if you want a rare K2 \u2013 drawing on stock it accumulated in the 1980s and 90s when unwanted and unloved red boxes were plentiful. \u201cWe supply boxes to private buyers and commercial organisations,\u201d says a director of X2Connect, Martin White. \u201cThey go all round the world. We\u2019ve done shopping malls in Florida and Dubai. They\u2019re very popular in Australia and America, but places in Europe take them as well. People put them in their gardens and companies have them in their offices. They buy them as birthday presents or just for themselves, telling us it\u2019s something they\u2019ve always wanted.\u201d White says that eventually the supply will dry up, but his company has enough to keep it going for a good few years yet. The cult of the boxes is a strange and powerful one. The sculptor David Mach, who 30 years ago laid 12 of them end to end in the centre of Kingston upon Thames in a celebrated piece of public art called Out of Order, describes them as a \u201cuniversal Great British thing\u201d. \u201cThe design is fantastic,\u201d he says, \u201cand then it seeps wholesale into the ground and comes back up through the soles of your feet.\u201d They have featured on a million postcards and, having been a central feature of British life for much of the 20th century, in many films. Tourists still go to the fishing village of Pennan in Aberdeenshire in search of the phone box that features prominently in the 1983 film Local Hero, not realising that the box used in the film was a wooden prop. Pennan does have a real box, with a less perfect view of the sea than in the film, so visitors make do with that. Scott\u2019s kiosks are loved in part because they are redolent of a time when the British were willing to build a small house from which anyone could make a call. They represent civic pride and national confidence \u2013 both now in short supply. Farmer is horrified at my suggestion that we should just let them go. Objects have a use, so why keep them when they lose that use? He finds such iconoclasm detestable. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to become like the Americans,\u201d he says. By which I presume he means a throwaway society. But equally the veneration of the past can go too far. We surround Battersea power station with anodyne, absurdly pricey flats and tell ourselves we have rescued it, even though it has lost all its stark beauty. I wonder how Scott\u2019s K2s and K6s will look 50 years from now, when everyone has forgotten why they were ever there and thinks they were built as micro-libraries and art galleries, coffee kiosks and collection points. Or in 1,000 years when, as with Stonehenge, our descendants will ascribe some deep religious significance to them. Which, given the way they are now worshipped, might not be far from the truth.",

      "bodyText": "This outfit is all Paul Smith. I originally wore it when I interviewed Tracey Emin on stage at the GQ Heroes weekend. I wanted to look the business: cool, effortless, but funky as well. I went into the Paul Smith store and that pink shirt with the red belt and those trousers was hanging on a hanger and I just said: \u201cThat\u2019s the look!\u201d Pink is the opposite of emasculating; I\u2019m not shy to wear pink. I work with a company called Pin Drop Studio, where we read stories to adults, and they had an event at the Tate Liverpool during the Keith Haring exhibition. I thought: \u201cWell, that outfit worked before; why not repeat it?\u201d That\u2019s where this photo was taken. Steve McQueen is my style icon. I look at pictures of him now and I think: I want to look like that. I also like Jean-Michel Basquiat\u2019s look \u2013 the cardigans; the loose-fitting, bohemian clothes. I\u2019m very envious of people who can look effortlessly stylish \u2013 it\u2019s what I aspire to. When you look like you\u2019ve made too much effort, I find it gives me a bit of a headache. My daily style is very casual; I love a cargo pant; I like to be comfortable. When I was younger, I wore a lot of clothes that I felt quite stiff in. I\u2019ve moved away from wearing jeans; I get too hot in them. When I go out, I\u2019m definitely a shirt man; I love a nice shirt and belt. As an actor, I\u2019m always in clothes that I wouldn\u2019t necessarily choose to wear myself. I played a character who was an alcoholic in a film called Tower Block [in 2012] and I was put in this leather coat, which was horrific; it fitted terribly. It wasn\u2019t attractive on any level, but it was what that character would wear \u2013 I thought: \u201cHe\u2019s in his own insular world, he\u2019s got a habit and he\u2019s completely caught up in that.\u201d Playing new characters is exciting when it comes to the clothes: it\u2019s about pushing yourself outside of your comfort zone.",

The still-touring Davies has stepped into a battle being repeated across the UK as investors seize on struggling high streets in towns and suburbs that have been battered by online shopping and rising business rates, and seek to turn them into housing. Policymakers believe a crisis last year during which the number of shops lying empty rose by more than 7,500 can be halted by turning them into homes. In the past five years, there has been a net loss of more than 1,000 independent shops, according to the Local Data Company (LDC).

      "body": "<p>Early this summer, the Denmark Under-21 international Jens Stage received a threatening message on Facebook. It read: \u201cYou will never be in Aarhus again \u2013 Judas.\u201d Stage\u2019s apparent crime was that he had joined FC Copenhagen from local side AGF.</p> <p>AGF had been paid around \u00a32.2m for the services of the versatile 22-year-old, which is among the biggest sums paid for a player moving between two Danish clubs, but that did not stop some fans from being infuriated by the deal. </p> <p>The player carried on with his life but then, in the early hours of 14 July, things turned a lot nastier. It was at around 2am when his flat was set on fire: two people were in the flat at the time and had to escape through a window. The police has not revealed if Stage was one of them. On a smoke bomb there was a message attached: \u201cIn Aarhus traitors are punished, you Judas bastard.\u201d</p> <p>The fire was quickly put out but could have been fatal if it had not been for the emergency services. \u201cThis is a very old building so it\u2019s lucky it didn\u2019t spread more,\u201d Kevin Jensen, a neighbour of Stage\u2019s, told the Danish newspaper, Ekstra Bladet. \u201cIt is horrible to think about what could have happened.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"29e8346d68961907d66429d9624fabe55783175d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29e8346d68961907d66429d9624fabe55783175d/0_0_1616_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Emergency services outside Jens Stage\u2019s apartment.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emergency services outside Jens Stage\u2019s apartment.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: presse-fotos.dk/Ritzau/Press Association Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Denmark was shocked by the events and support for Stage was quickly forthcoming. The police acted quickly and arrested three men in connection with the incident. All three remain in custody with a hearing to take place on 28 August. No date has been set for any subsequent trial. </p> <p>The CEO of the Danish Football Players\u2019 Association, Mads \u00d8land, was horrified by the attack. \u201cIt\u2019s an act of extreme violence that we condemn in the strongest possible ways,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it turns out to be football related \u2013 as it seems to be \u2013 it is horrible beyond all comprehension that anybody can commit such an act because a player transfers from one club to another. I have never experienced anything like it in Danish football. This should never happen because a person changes his workplace.\u201d</p> <p>AGF Aarhus \u2013 the club from where Stage transferred \u2013 were also quick to condemn the attack. The club\u2019s chief executive, Jakob Nielsen, said they would help police in any way and that the assailants, if proven to be supporters of the club, would face a lifelong ban from matches. Stage has decided not to comment on the incident and, apart from a brief condemnation of it on their website, FC Copenhagen are following the same path.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Denmark is not known for having a hooligan problem. Aarhus used to have a notorious outfit called Ultra White Pride, who combined hooliganism with extreme right-wing views and street violence, but they have more or less been out of sight for the past five years. Back in 2007, meanwhile, Denmark international Simon Poulsen received threatening phone calls from what appeared to be fans of his former club, Viborg, and three years before that, fans from the same club smashed Thomas Frandsen\u2019s fence after he had moved to a rival club. But that\u2019s really been it. So why this has happened? Well, no one in Denmark really knows and the hope within the country is that it is a single, crazed action that will not be repeated.</p> <p>At Divisionsforeningen, the separate entity under the Danish Football Association that runs the top three leagues, chief executive Claus Thomsen is certainly surprised by the attack on Stage. \u201cI don\u2019t remember anything like it,\u201d he says. \u201cPlayers have become more public persons than they were 10 years ago. But it\u2019s not my impression that they normally walk around fearing for their safety. Nor should they.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25200929e830ca5c9a323629da40dbfa4c7576d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25200929e830ca5c9a323629da40dbfa4c7576d7/0_0_4761_3174/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A fan of AGF Aarhus with a sign for former AGF player Jens Stage after the Danish 3F Superliga match against his new club FC Copenhagen on 19 July 2019.

      "bodyText": "Early this summer, the Denmark Under-21 international Jens Stage received a threatening message on Facebook. It read: \u201cYou will never be in Aarhus again \u2013 Judas.\u201d Stage\u2019s apparent crime was that he had joined FC Copenhagen from local side AGF. AGF had been paid around \u00a32.2m for the services of the versatile 22-year-old, which is among the biggest sums paid for a player moving between two Danish clubs, but that did not stop some fans from being infuriated by the deal. The player carried on with his life but then, in the early hours of 14 July, things turned a lot nastier. It was at around 2am when his flat was set on fire: two people were in the flat at the time and had to escape through a window. The police has not revealed if Stage was one of them. On a smoke bomb there was a message attached: \u201cIn Aarhus traitors are punished, you Judas bastard.\u201d The fire was quickly put out but could have been fatal if it had not been for the emergency services. \u201cThis is a very old building so it\u2019s lucky it didn\u2019t spread more,\u201d Kevin Jensen, a neighbour of Stage\u2019s, told the Danish newspaper, Ekstra Bladet. \u201cIt is horrible to think about what could have happened. Denmark was shocked by the events and support for Stage was quickly forthcoming. The police acted quickly and arrested three men in connection with the incident. All three remain in custody with a hearing to take place on 28 August. No date has been set for any subsequent trial. The CEO of the Danish Football Players\u2019 Association, Mads \u00d8land, was horrified by the attack. \u201cIt\u2019s an act of extreme violence that we condemn in the strongest possible ways,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it turns out to be football related \u2013 as it seems to be \u2013 it is horrible beyond all comprehension that anybody can commit such an act because a player transfers from one club to another. I have never experienced anything like it in Danish football. This should never happen because a person changes his workplace.\u201d AGF Aarhus \u2013 the club from where Stage transferred \u2013 were also quick to condemn the attack. The club\u2019s chief executive, Jakob Nielsen, said they would help police in any way and that the assailants, if proven to be supporters of the club, would face a lifelong ban from matches. Stage has decided not to comment on the incident and, apart from a brief condemnation of it on their website, FC Copenhagen are following the same path. Denmark is not known for having a hooligan problem. Aarhus used to have a notorious outfit called Ultra White Pride, who combined hooliganism with extreme right-wing views and street violence, but they have more or less been out of sight for the past five years. Back in 2007, meanwhile, Denmark international Simon Poulsen received threatening phone calls from what appeared to be fans of his former club, Viborg, and three years before that, fans from the same club smashed Thomas Frandsen\u2019s fence after he had moved to a rival club. But that\u2019s really been it. So why this has happened? Well, no one in Denmark really knows and the hope within the country is that it is a single, crazed action that will not be repeated. At Divisionsforeningen, the separate entity under the Danish Football Association that runs the top three leagues, chief executive Claus Thomsen is certainly surprised by the attack on Stage. \u201cI don\u2019t remember anything like it,\u201d he says. \u201cPlayers have become more public persons than they were 10 years ago. But it\u2019s not my impression that they normally walk around fearing for their safety. Nor should they.\u201d For now Stage is focusing on playing for Copenhagen. In Denmark as well as other countries there is an ongoing debate on how social-media attacks on public figures are making the tone of the debate more sinister \u2013 and whether this could result in more real-life attacks. Let\u2019s hope not. Tom Carstensen is a journalist who specialises in radical fan cultures and radical political movements. He is a former Premier League correspondent for Danish TV.",

The Jedi/Sith binary is one bound up in tradition and so the idea of a weapon of pure light \u2013 which can connote either good or evil depending on where it sits on the colour spectrum \u2013 fits the theme perfectly. From the earliest moments of the Star Wars universe, a clear link has been drawn between lightsabers and the characters wielding them.</p> <p>That link makes the new trilogy\u2019s lightsaber innovations even more interesting. Kylo Ren\u2019s weapon is explicitly tied to the immature, petulant bravado that leads him to regularly trash his surroundings in an adolescent strop. The saber was constructed by Ren himself and is evidently an imperfect creation, with its beam of light filled with static crackle \u2013 a hastily assembled tribute to the weapon of his idol and grandfather, Darth Vader. It\u2019s the equivalent of a 90s grunge kid recording a tinny version of Smells Like Teen Spirit and thinking he\u2019s Kurt Cobain.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"008129a15296b193eb04a1c7a9336dc74481737f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/008129a15296b193eb04a1c7a9336dc74481737f/0_134_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kylo Ren\u2019s DIY lightsaber.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kylo Ren brandishes his DIY lightsaber.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Disney/Lucasfilm</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is also the only lightsaber to feature a crossguard. There is a technical explanation for the innovation, as fans of deep-dive Lucas lore will know: the <a href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kylo_Ren%27s_lightsaber\">damaged kyber crystal</a> in the handle of the device would overload the blade if it were not vented through the ancillary beams. However, perhaps the immature Ren \u2013 an avatar for fragile masculinity \u2013 also just thought it looked cool.</p> <p>So what does Rey\u2019s new lightsaber tell us about her? Intricate fan theories already abound that posit Rey and Kylo Ren as two sides of the same proverbial coin. The idea of \u201cbringing balance to the force\u201d has been a constant theme throughout the series, and it\u2019s that which is symbolised by Rey\u2019s lightsaber \u2013 two equal, parallel forces uniting to form something completely balanced, like Thanos\u2019s double-sided weapon in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/23/avengers-endgame-review-unconquerable-brilliance-takes-marvel-to-new-heights\">Avengers: Endgame</a>.</p> <p>One explanation for the incongruous clip of Rey channelling her goth side is that it\u2019s some sort of dream sequence. But it would seem bizarre for Abrams and his team to create such an innovative new lightsaber design for the sake of a single throwaway moment. There may be more going on here than meets the eye.</p> <p>Or maybe Disney just wants something new to fill the shelves of toy shops.</p>",

The Jedi/Sith binary is one bound up in tradition and so the idea of a weapon of pure light \u2013 which can connote either good or evil depending on where it sits on the colour spectrum \u2013 fits the theme perfectly. From the earliest moments of the Star Wars universe, a clear link has been drawn between lightsabers and the characters wielding them. That link makes the new trilogy\u2019s lightsaber innovations even more interesting. Kylo Ren\u2019s weapon is explicitly tied to the immature, petulant bravado that leads him to regularly trash his surroundings in an adolescent strop. The saber was constructed by Ren himself and is evidently an imperfect creation, with its beam of light filled with static crackle \u2013 a hastily assembled tribute to the weapon of his idol and grandfather, Darth Vader. It\u2019s the equivalent of a 90s grunge kid recording a tinny version of Smells Like Teen Spirit and thinking he\u2019s Kurt Cobain. It is also the only lightsaber to feature a crossguard. There is a technical explanation for the innovation, as fans of deep-dive Lucas lore will know: the damaged kyber crystal in the handle of the device would overload the blade if it were not vented through the ancillary beams. However, perhaps the immature Ren \u2013 an avatar for fragile masculinity \u2013 also just thought it looked cool. So what does Rey\u2019s new lightsaber tell us about her? Intricate fan theories already abound that posit Rey and Kylo Ren as two sides of the same proverbial coin. The idea of \u201cbringing balance to the force\u201d has been a constant theme throughout the series, and it\u2019s that which is symbolised by Rey\u2019s lightsaber \u2013 two equal, parallel forces uniting to form something completely balanced, like Thanos\u2019s double-sided weapon in Avengers: Endgame. One explanation for the incongruous clip of Rey channelling her goth side is that it\u2019s some sort of dream sequence. But it would seem bizarre for Abrams and his team to create such an innovative new lightsaber design for the sake of a single throwaway moment. There may be more going on here than meets the eye. Or maybe Disney just wants something new to fill the shelves of toy shops.",

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.<br></p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The Right Rev Alan Wilson said: \u201cIn a mature democracy people would not be afraid of doing this, because it would show what people\u2019s concerns and fears and hopes and aspirations around this subject were.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cIt is essential not only in this house but for the leaders of both sides and throughout our society to challenge the attacks, the xenophobia and the racism that seem to have been felt to be acceptable at least for a while.\u201d</p> \n<p>Axel Antoni, a spokesman for The3million, said: \u201cNo-deal Brexit would have dire consequences for the over 3 million EU citizens in the UK and the 1.2 million British in Europe.

China controls another part in the east.<br></p>\n    <p>India and Pakistan have gone to war a further two times over Kashmir, most recently in 1999. Artillery, mortar and small arms fire are still frequently exchanged.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How did the dispute start?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>After the partition of colonial India in 1947, small, semi-autonomous \u2018princely states\u2019 across the subcontinent were being folded into India or Pakistan. The ruler of Kashmir dithered over which to join until tribal fighters entered from Pakistan intent on taking the region for Islamabad.</p>\n    <p>Kashmir asked Delhi for assistance, signing a treaty of accession in exchange for the intervention of Indian troops, who fought the Pakistanis to the modern-day line of control.</p>\n    <p>In 1948, the UN security council called for a referendum in Kashmir to determine which country the region would join or whether it would become an independent state. The referendum has never been held.</p>\n    <p>In its 1950 constitution, India granted Kashmir a large measure of independence. But since then it has eroded some of that autonomy and repeatedly intervened to rig elections and dismiss and jail democratically elected leaders.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was Kashmir\u2019s special status?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Kashmir\u2019s special status, given in exchange for joining the Indian union, had been in place since 14 May 1954. Under article 370, the state was given a separate constitution, a flag, and autonomy over all matters except for foreign affairs and defence.&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p>An additional provision, article 35a, prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believed this was crucial to protecting the demography of the Muslim-majority state and its way of life.</p>\n    <p>The ruling Bharatiya Janata party repeatedly promised to scrap such rules, a long-term demand of its Hindu nationalist support base. But analysts warned doing so would almost certainly ignite unrest.</p>\n    <p>On Wednesday 31 October 2019, the government formally revoked Kashmir\u2019s special status. The government argued that the provision had&nbsp; only ever intended to be temporary and that scrapping it would boost investment in Kashmir. Critics, however, said the move would escalate tensions with Pakistan \u2013 which quickly called India\u2019s actions illegal \u2013 and fuel resentment in Kashmir, where there is an insurgency against Indian rule.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do the militants want?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule over its section of Kashmir for the past three decades. Indian soldiers and Pakistan-backed guerrillas fought a war rife with accusations of torture, forced disappearances and extra-judicial killing.<br></p>\n    <p>Until 2004, the militancy was made up largely of Pakistani and Afghan fighters. Since then, especially after protests were quashed with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/08/india-crackdown-in-kashmir-is-this-worlds-first-mass-blinding\">extreme force</a>&nbsp;in 2016, locals have made up a growing share of the anti-India fighters.</p>\n    <p>For Indians, control of Kashmir \u2013 part of the country\u2019s only Muslim-majority state \u2013 has been proof of its commitment to religious pluralism. For Pakistan, a state founded as a homeland for south Asian Muslims, it is the last occupied home of its co-religionists. <br><b><br>Michael Safi and Rebecca Ratcliffe</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The revocation of special status from the state of Jammu and Kashmir has stripped it of any autonomy, removing its constitution and rules that have prevented outsiders from buying land.

Visitors are boarding a ferry to pastis baron Paul Ricard\u2019s island Les Embiez, and the bright red Sanary Explorer, half-boat, half-submarine, takes trips to see the starfish, sea urchins and meadows of Neptune grass. Afternoon The walk to Portissol beach takes around 15 minutes, up the steep Mont\u00e9e de l\u2019Oratoire to Notre-Dame de Piti\u00e9. The chapel was founded in 1560 and looked after by hermits who lit warning fires if there were Barbary pirates, the Duke of Savoy or a storm approaching. At the top of the hill is the Villa Baobab, home of the late scuba-diving pioneer and underwater film-maker Jacques Cousteau, who ended up in Sanary after fleeing the Nazis along with members of the German and Austrian literary scene, Thomas Mann, Joseph Roth, Klaus Mann and Stefan Zweig. Portissol beach fills up early but is then abandoned at lunchtime as sunbathers head for the nearest beach restaurant, leaving a waffle pattern of towels on the grainy sand. A family waves me over. \u201cWe saw you on the boat this morning!\u201d They look at each other and laugh, three generations sharing a beach towel. \u201cYou looked a bit green. I said to Pierre-Alain [her son], \u2018Look at him gripping the sides!\u2019\u201d The Mistral wind can make things very choppy in Sanary-sur-Mer. I walk along the Quai Sud, a walkway at the side of the beach where there\u2019s a seawater lagoon reserved for children practising snorkelling, and, a little further on, a diving zone where buoyant adolescents are leaping backwards into the sea. At the far end of the rocks is a cove where the smokers, dogs and inflatable beach balls hang out, none of whom are allowed on the main plage. Portissol has a thick hemline of washed-up Neptune grass between sand and sea. \u201cIt\u2019s illegal to remove it now,\u201d explains Axel Zoellin, who works at the beach restaurant \u00d4 Petit Monde. The grass protects the beach. \u201cIt gets very busy here as the beach is sheltered from the wind and popular with families. We prefer to go swimming in the rocky creeks along the coast.\u201d Axel grew up nearby, like his co-worker Luna Penn, but they actually met in Australia. Un vrai petit monde. The trendy restaurant is a cabin of modern furniture and driftwood, open every day, even during the winter, with live music on Sundays and five guestrooms upstairs. \u201cWe can seat 200 people, but out of season, it\u2019s just locals who come,\u201d says Zoellin. Evening Sanary\u2019s 21m-high stone watchtower is the emblem of the town and stood there, isolated, from the middle of the 13th century until 1507 when local inhabitants were allowed to build homes attached to its base. It stays open until 9.30pm on summer weekends, so I climb up the stone stairs and ladders to its terrace, perfect for watching the sunset. Dinner is at H\u00f4tel de la Tour which has been run by the Mercier family since 1936. I have the fish soup and monkfish medallions but every other table has ordered the poisson en cro\u00fbte de sel, a whole sea bass baked inside a mound of salt. Waiters crack open the salt crust with wooden mallets and ladle away the crystals, a theatrical excavation that serves two to three. My wife looks up from her scampi and we decide to be braver next time. Midnight, back on the portside, the night market is coming to an end and a street performer finishes with Charles Trenet\u2019s La Mer under the harbour\u2019s palm trees. I take the late-night trip on the Sanary Explorer, whose underwater lights pick up the moray eels phytoplankton and wake up any fish who\u2019d already turned in for the night in the Neptune grass. \u2022 H\u00f4tel de la Tour has doubles from \u20ac88 B&amp;B; its restaurant serves a two-course lunchtime formule for \u20ac24. \u00d4 Petit Monde on serves mains from \u20ac22 Looking for a holiday with a difference?

It is going to be a very difficult case to navigate legally.\u201d Yang is the latest in a string of foreign nationals to be arrested in China and charged with espionage or attempting to steal state secrets. Several Australians have faced jail time in China over the past decade, including the former head of global miner Rio Tinto\u2019s China iron ore business, Stern Hu, who served eight years after a conviction in 2010 for corruption and stealing commercial secrets. His arrest in 2008 came after tension flared between the world\u2019s top user of iron ore and its biggest supplier, Australia. More recently, 16 staff from Australia\u2019s Crown Resorts, including three Australians, were jailed for between nine and 10 months in 2017 and fined 8.62m yuan for promoting gambling to lure Chinese high-rollers to its casinos. Australia has sought to avoid friction with Beijing, but Yang\u2019s arrest will increase public pressure on Canberra to take a tougher line against its most important trade partner.",

      "body": "<p>Just before he died at his Oxford home in December 1945, Otto Neurath said something lovely to his third wife, Marie. The philosopher had been reading an article on the subject of happiness, when he turned to her and said: \u201cI can tell you what I mean by happiness. If godfather would come to me and say: \u2018Dear Otto, I make you an offer as you are living now with your books and your work and your wife.

They had been inspired by the English philosopher Charles Kay Ogden, who proposed that English could be boiled down to 850 words. The language, called Basic, could be learned in days and, he hoped, would pave the way to peace by reversing the curse of Babel. Their Isotype Institute, founded in Vienna, had the slogan: <a href=\"http://wittgensteinrepository.org/agora-ontos/article/view/2197\">\u201cWords divide, pictures unite.\u201d</a> In hindsight, they were communication pioneers in that their new visual language pre-empted emojis.</p> <p>But while Otto has long been celebrated as a philosopher and social reformer, the work of Marie has been relatively neglected \u2013 until now. London\u2019s House of Illustration has a beguiling little show called <a href=\"https://www.houseofillustration.org.uk/whats-on/current-future-events/marie-neurath-picturing-science\">Marie Neurath: Picturing Science</a>, celebrating her work at the Isotype Institute until her own death in London in 1986. From her husband\u2019s death until the 1970s, she led a team of illustrators who produced more than 80 children\u2019s books, half of them devoted to science education.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>It is not so much the question of  how to transfer in the most direct way some knowledge, but how to satisfy the possible questions of a child</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The beautiful books on show at the exhibition \u2013 among them Too Small to See, Inside the Atom and Railways under London \u2013 were modelled on Otto\u2019s conviction that data pictorially organised could say more than words. In a 1944 typescript explaining the value of Isotype books exhibited in the show, he wrote: \u201cThere are many fine books, giving information to adults and children, but usually they are \u2018learned\u2019. These Isotype books try to avoid that \u2026 It is not so much the question of how to transfer in the most direct and simple way some knowledge, but how to satisfy the possible questions of a child, his love of action, his identifying himself with a person on the page.\u201d</p> <p>As a child, Otto had been fascinated by Egyptian hieroglyphics, not just their forms but how they communicated a story. While the narrative of human progress usually has hieroglyphics as way station to sophisticated written and verbal communication (the British Library\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/events/writing-making-your-mark\">current superb show on writing</a> suggests as much), Otto held on to the value of simple rule-based combinations of symbols and colours, particularly to graphically show complex data in easily graspable ways. After the first world war, he was inspired in developing this visual language by Soviet constructivism and the German Bauhaus, and sharing their minimalist aesthetics and utopian, modernist spirit.</p> <p>At the time, Otto was working as director of the Museum of City Planning in what was known as Red Vienna, the post-first world war era from 1918 to 1934 when the city became a crucible for socialist living. The museum\u2019s purpose was to educate the Viennese public about postwar social housing and at exhibitions he would showcase a symbol-based language as an alternative to written language. It was there that he met Marie, a physicist, mathematician and art-school graduate who became what they called a \u201ctransformer\u201d \u2013 an intermediary between data collectors (historians, statisticians and economists) and graphic artists. Today, she would have been called a graphic designer. Indeed, without the Neuraths, graphic design as we know it might not have existed.</p> <p>As the project grew, Otto hired artists including Erwin Bernath and Gerd Arntz, for what would become known as the Isotype Institute. Along with Marie, they pioneered the professional design of a <a href=\"http://www.gerdarntz.org/isotype\">visual language for the public communication of historical and statistical information</a>.</p> <p>At the same time as working in the museum and developing the Isotype Institute, Otto was becoming an eminent philosopher, a leading member of the Vienna Circle of logical positivists and tilting at the Marxist Jews of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/mar/25/anders-breivik-frankfurt-school\">Frankfurt School</a>, whose scorn for scientific progress and Enlightenment values he loathed. Indeed, the Isotype Institute was a self-conscious continuation of the Enlightenment\u2019s most resonant project: 18th-century French philosophers\u2019 attempt to promote the advancement of science and secular thought through an illustrated encyclopaedia.</p> <p>Once exiled from Austria, the Neuraths became even more ambitious. They created the International Foundation for Visual Education in The Hague, and spearheaded the international Unity of Science movement that launched a project called the Encyclopedia of Unified Science, aimed at using pictorial languages to proselytise for international scientific and social cooperation \u2013 a beautiful idea, if one effectively eliminated by the increasing darkness of the times.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d6bbe916568e71e53130ae195937a8239444f0ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6bbe916568e71e53130ae195937a8239444f0ca/0_0_4982_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clarity and insight \u2026 Marie Neurath\u2019s children\u2019s book jackets.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"602\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clarity and insight \u2026 Marie Neurath\u2019s children\u2019s book jackets.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Otto and Marie Neurath Isotype Collection at University of Reading</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But while Red Vienna remains architecturally renowned for such imposing blocks as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/apr/27/vienna-karl-marx-hof-architecture-politics-ideology-history-cities-50-buildings\">Karl Marx Hof </a>and the Rabenhof, featuring communal facilities such as bathhouses, laundries, kindergartens, libraries and even kitchens, Otto Neurath backed a different solution for a housing revolution. In 1934, he and Marie oversaw the opening of a workers\u2019 association housing complex (<em>Werkbundsliedung</em>), an estate of 70 houses in south-west Vienna that offered working-class families the opportunity to purchase or rent homes designed by a diverse group of 31 international architects, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/feb/20/adolf-loos-riba-exhibition-review\">Adolf Loos</a>.</p> <p>A decade later, the Neuraths were invited to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/aug/02/pursuit-happiness-black-country-town-bilston\">work in Bilston</a> in the Black Country. Like Vienna after the first world war, Bilston after the second world war \u2013 a town of 31,000 \u2013 desperately needed new housing. After hearing Otto lecture on Vienna in Wolverhampton, Bilston\u2019s town clerk invited the socialist philosopher to help. Williams was impressed by his humane vision: \u201cHe made one believe in the dignity of human beings.\u201d</p> <p>As Neurath wrote: \u201cOn estates, mix up individuals: married and unmarried, old and young. Do not create ghettos of, for example, old people who, if they are stuck altogether in flats, will feel isolated, lonely and unwanted. If you put them in with young people, they can do things like babysitting and feel useful and wanted.\u201d Again, a beautiful dream, too rarely realised.</p> <p>But, just as the rise of Austrian fascism scotched the Neuraths\u2019 dreams of a Viennese socialist paradise, so Otto\u2019s early death thwarted the couple\u2019s plan to make Bilston happy. While the estate still exists, it\u2019s scarcely the socialist paradise they hoped to create.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e575f1c484676639dd9f476ee7ed3150547e69ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e575f1c484676639dd9f476ee7ed3150547e69ab/0_0_4579_2691/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A spread from Marie Neurath\u2019s book I Show You How It Happens.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"588\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spring up all over \u2026 a spread from Marie Neurath\u2019s book I Show You How It Happens.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laura Bennetto/Otto and Marie Neurath Isotype Collection at University of Reading</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>More happily, Marie carried on the work of the Isotype Institute, focusing on rendering complex scientific ideas in visual form. Many of the results can be seen in this exhibition and they\u2019re unexpectedly beautiful as well as instructive. Though the books on display were created for children, I found them unbelievably helpful. In fact, epiphany followed epiphany as I stood for long minutes realising for the first time how bread is made, how insects pollinate plants and how volcanoes work. Later, I spent even happier minutes elbowing small children aside at the activity table where I was tasked with numbering in the right order the pictures showing what happens in a bird\u2019s egg, based on four frames from a children\u2019s book that shows Marie at her best \u2013 explaining complex concepts in easily understood ways.</p> <p>Co-curator Katie Nairne argues that Marie Neurath\u2019s \u201cgroundbreaking approach has had a huge impact on contemporary design and infographics and deserves much greater acclaim than it currently receives\u201d. Now, 33 years after her death, she is finally getting it.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.houseofillustration.org.uk/whats-on/current-future-events/marie-neurath-picturing-science\">Marie Neurath: Picturing Science</a> is at House of Illustration, London, until 3 November.</p>",

At the same time as working in the museum and developing the Isotype Institute, Otto was becoming an eminent philosopher, a leading member of the Vienna Circle of logical positivists and tilting at the Marxist Jews of the Frankfurt School, whose scorn for scientific progress and Enlightenment values he loathed. Indeed, the Isotype Institute was a self-conscious continuation of the Enlightenment\u2019s most resonant project: 18th-century French philosophers\u2019 attempt to promote the advancement of science and secular thought through an illustrated encyclopaedia. Once exiled from Austria, the Neuraths became even more ambitious. They created the International Foundation for Visual Education in The Hague, and spearheaded the international Unity of Science movement that launched a project called the Encyclopedia of Unified Science, aimed at using pictorial languages to proselytise for international scientific and social cooperation \u2013 a beautiful idea, if one effectively eliminated by the increasing darkness of the times. But while Red Vienna remains architecturally renowned for such imposing blocks as the Karl Marx Hof and the Rabenhof, featuring communal facilities such as bathhouses, laundries, kindergartens, libraries and even kitchens, Otto Neurath backed a different solution for a housing revolution. In 1934, he and Marie oversaw the opening of a workers\u2019 association housing complex (Werkbundsliedung), an estate of 70 houses in south-west Vienna that offered working-class families the opportunity to purchase or rent homes designed by a diverse group of 31 international architects, including Adolf Loos. A decade later, the Neuraths were invited to work in Bilston in the Black Country. Like Vienna after the first world war, Bilston after the second world war \u2013 a town of 31,000 \u2013 desperately needed new housing. After hearing Otto lecture on Vienna in Wolverhampton, Bilston\u2019s town clerk invited the socialist philosopher to help. Williams was impressed by his humane vision: \u201cHe made one believe in the dignity of human beings.\u201d As Neurath wrote: \u201cOn estates, mix up individuals: married and unmarried, old and young. Do not create ghettos of, for example, old people who, if they are stuck altogether in flats, will feel isolated, lonely and unwanted. If you put them in with young people, they can do things like babysitting and feel useful and wanted.\u201d Again, a beautiful dream, too rarely realised. But, just as the rise of Austrian fascism scotched the Neuraths\u2019 dreams of a Viennese socialist paradise, so Otto\u2019s early death thwarted the couple\u2019s plan to make Bilston happy. While the estate still exists, it\u2019s scarcely the socialist paradise they hoped to create. More happily, Marie carried on the work of the Isotype Institute, focusing on rendering complex scientific ideas in visual form. Many of the results can be seen in this exhibition and they\u2019re unexpectedly beautiful as well as instructive. Though the books on display were created for children, I found them unbelievably helpful. In fact, epiphany followed epiphany as I stood for long minutes realising for the first time how bread is made, how insects pollinate plants and how volcanoes work. Later, I spent even happier minutes elbowing small children aside at the activity table where I was tasked with numbering in the right order the pictures showing what happens in a bird\u2019s egg, based on four frames from a children\u2019s book that shows Marie at her best \u2013 explaining complex concepts in easily understood ways. Co-curator Katie Nairne argues that Marie Neurath\u2019s \u201cgroundbreaking approach has had a huge impact on contemporary design and infographics and deserves much greater acclaim than it currently receives\u201d. Now, 33 years after her death, she is finally getting it. \u2022 Marie Neurath: Picturing Science is at House of Illustration, London, until 3 November.",

      "bodyText": "As kids, with toy cars for goalposts and a washing line that doubled up as a makeshift crossbar, Matt and Joseph Mills duelled with their elder brothers Jonathan and Jamie in the back garden of the family home in west Swindon. These days, things have come somewhat full circle, with the pair back on the same team at Forest Green Rovers. They shared a room growing up and lived together when their paths crossed in the north-west a few years ago but until the start of this month, they had never played together professionally. \u201cWe grew up playing two v two,\u201d says Joseph, 29, the club captain, sitting alongside Matt, 33, a player-coach, fresh from devouring a vegan \u2013 in line with the League Two club\u2019s sustainable ethos \u2013 red Thai curry. \u201cWe always had a close bond. We room together now on away trips and it feels like we have gone back in time. When I\u2019m speaking to family or my other brothers and they\u2019ll be like: \u2018Who are you with?\u2019 And I\u2019ll just flip my camera [around] and be like: \u2018This guy again.\u2019 It just feels familiar rolling back the years. It\u2019s nice.\u201d Joseph is set to lead the team at Bournemouth in the Carabao Cup second round on Wednesday, while Matt is eligible to help the manager, Mark Cooper, outwit Eddie Howe, a former teammate, on the touchline after a red card last weekend ended his chances of playing against the Premier League club. Mills will assume assistant manager duties in the absence of Scott Lindsey, Cooper\u2019s No 2, as he did at Charlton in the previous round. Joseph and Matt graduated through the revered Southampton academy and, at one point, all four siblings had professional contracts; the eldest, Jamie, was once on the books at Swindon, while Jonathan signed professional terms with Southampton after coming through at Oxford. \u201cThe three years between me and you [coming through] I think have been probably the most fruitful of spell of the academy,\u201d Matt says, glancing across at his younger brother. \u201cYou\u2019ve got your household names: Theo Walcott, Gareth Bale and Adam Lallana. \u201cI just remember we all used to live in, like, a B&amp;B that was converted into a lodge for Southampton players, where you got catered for and you get the speech when you go in the room like: \u2018One of you is going to make it\u2019 \u2013 but basically everybody made it. It was incredible, the ability we had in those three years. We were just churning players out straight into the first team.\u201d Matt went on to play in the Premier League with Manchester City and Joseph in the Championship with Reading and Doncaster, where his brother had previously played \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ve left and been like: \u2018I know a good left-back as well,\u2019\u201d Matt says, jokingly \u2013 before uniting this summer after the former left the Indian Super League side Pune City. \u201cI said: \u2018Listen, can I come in and train?

The brothers always had a desire to go abroad \u2013 Joseph spent two years at Perth Glory \u2013 and playing together is another tick off the bucket list, having twice played against each other (one win apiece). \u201cWe have a group chat as a family and a lot of the talk, especially from us two, has always been football, in different parts of the country and the world and all of sudden those chats are purely Forest Green,\u201d says Matt. \u201cIt saves one [of our parents] missing out and driving to a different ground [to watch].

It was reported then that he was going to be made to attend anger-management classes. \u201cNonsense,\u201d said Stokes, because as one of the chapter headings puts it in the book, \u201cwho needs anger management?\u201d The point is that each of these incidents has its own alternative history, too. Every one could have been the beginning of something new. They were the turning points he passed along the way to that court date in August 2018. \u201cThat was a year ago, a long time ago,\u201d Stokes said it when came up in his press conference at Headingley on Sunday. And that was all he wanted to say about it. Only he, his friends, family and teammates know how it has all affected him. But from where we are sitting it seems pretty clear there is one big change. These last few months, he has grown into the best version of himself. He has fulfilled his potential in a way few people in any walk of life ever do, has wrung every last drop out of his talent, with nothing squandered. Whatever else happens in the remaining two Ashes Tests, Stokes will always own this summer, just like Ian Botham owned 1981 and Andrew Flintoff did 2005. In the public mind we will always see him with his bat in hand, arms spread wide either side in celebration, and that grim security camera footage of him we all watched a year ago will come to seem even more blurred, grainy and distant.",

But we cannot allow you to destroy everything.\u201d He also acknowledged that Europe, by importing soya from Brazil, was not without blame for the agricultural pressure on the rainforest, saying: \u201cWe are partly complicit.\u201d The diplomatic row between the leaders had escalated earlier in the day, when Macron condemned Bolsonaro for what he called \u201cextraordinarily rude\u201d comments made about his wife, Brigitte, after the Brazilian president expressed approval online for a Facebook post implying that Brigitte Macron was not as good-looking as his own wife, Michelle. \u201cHe has made some extraordinarily rude comments about my wife,\u201d Macron said at a press conference in Biarritz when asked to react to statements about him by the Brazilian government. \u201cWhat can I say? It\u2019s sad. It\u2019s sad for him firstly, and for Brazilians,\u201d he added. Macron said he hoped for the sake of the Brazilian people \u201cthat they will very soon have a president who behaves in the right way\u201d. The US president, Donald Trump, skipped the summit session aimed at finding solutions to global heating through tree planting and shifting from fossil fuels to wind energy. In a press conference after the summit, he was dismissive of efforts to change direction. \u201cI feel the US has tremendous wealth \u2026 I\u2019m not going to lose that wealth on dreams, on windmills \u2013 which, frankly, aren\u2019t working too well,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I know more about the environment than most.\u201d Environmental groups said G7\u2019s emergency fire aid was insufficient and failed to address the trade and consumption drivers of deforestation. \u201cThe offer of $20m is chump change, especially as the crisis in the Amazon is directly linked to overconsumption of meat and dairy in the UK and other G7 countries,\u201d said Richard George, the head of forests for Greenpeace UK.",

      "body": "<p>In the 15 years since I\u2019ve been doing this job, my hopes that I would see a decent and humane prison system in this country in my lifetime have seldom risen above the level of \u201cunlikely\u201d. And a few times I have believed the state of jails in England and Wales simply could not get any worse, only to see it do so. The lowest point, until now perhaps, came during the reign of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/dec/05/prison-book-ban-unlawful-court-chris-grayling\" title=\"\">book-banning justice </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/dec/05/prison-book-ban-unlawful-court-chris-grayling\" title=\"\">secretary, Chris Grayling</a>, from 2012-15. But even after his unlamented departure, there has been little for reformers to cheer, with ever-rising tides of self-harm, violence, overcrowding and squalor. And I can barely recall the last positive <a href=\"https://www.justiceinspectorates.gov.uk/hmiprisons/#.U4yR31Mumjg\" title=\"\">prison inspection report</a> I have read.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/aug/27/prison-garden-inmates-mental-health-hmp-parc-royal-horticultural-society\">How a gardening scheme is reaping rewards for prisoners\u2019 mental health | Clare Horton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There have been brief moments of hope. The last justice secretary, David Gauke, seemed to have a grasp of the basics when he proposed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/feb/18/prison-simply-is-not-working-justice-secretary-david-gauke-calls-for-end-to-short-jail-terms\" title=\"\">abolition of short sentences</a> \u2013 six months or less. All experienced prison watchers know that prisoners serving such short stretches seldom leave the confines of the local jails the courts send themto, which have the worst conditions in the penal estate. He intended to replace short sentences with community service orders and substance misuse programmes, both of which have <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/814177/impact-short-custodial-sentences.pdf\" title=\"\">significantly lower re</a><a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/814177/impact-short-custodial-sentences.pdf\" title=\"\">offending rates</a> than short spells in prison.</p> <p>Before losing his cabinet place, Gauke urged the new prime minister not to take the traditional Conservative hard line on crime, but to \u201cfollow the evidence, of what works and what doesn\u2019t\u201d. He quoted figures from the Ministry of Justice showing that reoffending costs the taxpayer <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmworpen/58/5804.htm\" title=\"\">about \u00a315bn </a><a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmworpen/58/5804.htm\" title=\"\">a year</a>.</p> <p>Some hope.

      "bodyText": "In the 15 years since I\u2019ve been doing this job, my hopes that I would see a decent and humane prison system in this country in my lifetime have seldom risen above the level of \u201cunlikely\u201d. And a few times I have believed the state of jails in England and Wales simply could not get any worse, only to see it do so. The lowest point, until now perhaps, came during the reign of the book-banning justice secretary, Chris Grayling, from 2012-15. But even after his unlamented departure, there has been little for reformers to cheer, with ever-rising tides of self-harm, violence, overcrowding and squalor. And I can barely recall the last positive prison inspection report I have read. There have been brief moments of hope. The last justice secretary, David Gauke, seemed to have a grasp of the basics when he proposed the abolition of short sentences \u2013 six months or less. All experienced prison watchers know that prisoners serving such short stretches seldom leave the confines of the local jails the courts send themto, which have the worst conditions in the penal estate. He intended to replace short sentences with community service orders and substance misuse programmes, both of which have significantly lower reoffending rates than short spells in prison. Before losing his cabinet place, Gauke urged the new prime minister not to take the traditional Conservative hard line on crime, but to \u201cfollow the evidence, of what works and what doesn\u2019t\u201d. He quoted figures from the Ministry of Justice showing that reoffending costs the taxpayer about \u00a315bn a year. Some hope. Boris Johnson has not only scrapped Gauke\u2019s forward-thinking plans on short sentences, he has announced he will build 10,000 new prison places and end the \u201cearly release\u201d of prisoners. The plans have actually been in place since 2015, and \u201cearly release\u201d \u2013 at the halfway point of fixed-term sentences \u2013 is dependent on the prisoner\u2019s good behaviour. But why let the evidence stop the flow of rabble-rousing rhetoric? Let the public believe that we have a \u201ccock-eyed, crook-coddling criminal justice system\u201d in place. Depressingly, this approach may work for Johnson in electoral terms. Prisoners can\u2019t vote and don\u2019t garner much sympathy from those who can. Yet we already lock up more of our citizens, and for longer, than any other country in western Europe \u2013 with appalling results. Can you imagine the public sustaining a health service where the majority of patients don\u2019t get better? So why continue to pour money into a penal system that clearly fails both prisoners and public? When I first entered prison as an adult, in the 1960s, the No 1 rule in the prison service manual read, according to my memory, the purpose of imprisonment was \u201cto teach prisoners to lead a good and useful life\u201d. A pretty sensible commandment. Half a century on, prison rehabilitation projects have slipped further and further down the prison pecking order, with containment and punishment the priorities.

      "body": "<p>The first time I ever put a \u200b5\u00bc-inch disk into an Apple II drive to play <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72k1ZYp83tc\">Lode Runner</a>, I was hooked. It seemed wildly futuristic \u2013 this was in the early 1980s \u2013 but there was also something pleasingly analogue about the process. You had to slide the disc from its sleeve like a vinyl record, then gently feed it into the mouth of the drive, before closing the little plastic door behind it with a satisfying click.</p> <p>The loading noise was a stuttering series of electronic snare drum taps, accompanied by the baseline hum of the computer itself. There was something almost organic about it, like a CT scan or ultrasound. To me it seemed incredible that typing something on a screen could cause the disk to start loading, as though I was talking to the computer, and the clicking noise only accentuated this feeling of communication. In these early days of video game playing, the actual game was only part of the experience \u2013 the allure began with the novelty of the loading process. The retrofuturistic noise of a disk drive still makes me wistful whenever I hear it on old movies and TV shows, or highly specialist YouTube videos such as this one:</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dub4nraPLlQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Dub4nraPLlQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Veteran video game players may also remember, often with similarly warm nostalgia, the experience of loading a game on to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2012/apr/23/zx-spectrum-computer-masses-games\">ZX Spectrum</a> or Commodore 64. They came on cassette tapes, so you had that chunky, rattling sound as you grabbed the tape from its plastic case. Then there were all the noises we associate with tape players: the clunk of the eject button, sliding the tape in, pushing the lid back down. This sequence of actions, also familiar from playing music tapes, was hugely fetishised by teen movies of the era. If someone was going to play music in a 1980s movie, we\u2019d always get <a href=\"https://youtu.be/r_ArQ06WTVI\">a closeup shot of the tape going in</a>, the lid being closed and the play button being pressed. It meant something cool was coming. It was the same with video games.</p> <p>And pressing play was just the beginning. When a game started loading on a Speccy, the speaker would begin to emit a series of high-pitched screeching noises, like incredibly challenging electronic music \u2013 the literal sound of data, of ones and noughts, being rendered as audio. Experienced players got to know and understand the unique noises each of their games made, and could tell when they were about to finish loading from the tones being played. The sound was also freighted with tension because, if it stopped, it generally meant the process had crashed and you\u2019d have to start loading again \u2013 which could mean another five minutes of waiting.</p> <p>When you had friends over, all hoping to be the first to get a go on Way of the Exploding Fist, the tension was multiplied. You\u2019d all sit around the tape player like safe crackers, listening intently, hoping for the right clicks. The veteran games programmer Fred Williams, who wrote several classic titles for Codemasters, reminded me about \u2018The Chuntey\u2019, the name given by Spectrum fans to the invisible field surrounding the machine\u2019s cassette player into which only positive vibes could be admitted or else the process would break down. Loading was a religious ceremony and the sounds were sacrosanct.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0EfycbDhiw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/V0EfycbDhiw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>With consoles such as the NES and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/aug/16/sega-genesis-at-30-mega-drive-console-modern-games-industry\">Mega Drive</a>, the sounds were different again. Your games were on cartridges that came in big plastic boxes that opened with a satisfying thunk. You\u2019d have to lever them out of their holders and then jam your cartridge into the console port, hearing the ping of the cart\u2019s copper contacts easing into the input array. Carts were so hefty and <em>present</em>, like VHS tapes, and they often worryingly rattled a little bit too, which again gave gamers a clue about how long they were likely to last or why they weren\u2019t loading.</p> <p>Nowadays, all we hear is the soft whine as a DVD or Blu-Ray drive spins into motion. It\u2019s still a nice sound, but there is little variety and it doesn\u2019t give you as much feedback about the loading process. We can\u2019t speak or understand the language of loading any more. And many of us download games digitally anyway, so there is no sound at all.</p> <p>I really miss the early whirs, clicks and plasticky clunks of old video game systems. There was something so comforting about them. I remember reading an interview with Ridley Scott in which he talked about how the sounds of the life support systems coming online at the beginning of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/mar/01/alien-review-ridley-scott-lethally-contemporary-masterpiece\">Alien</a> were meant to resemble the noises babies hear in the womb. There is definitely something of that in old floppy disk drives, analogue monitors and processor fans.</p> <p>But for me, it\u2019s the grinding electronic dirge of the 8-bit computer loading screens that brings the most nostalgia. A few indie musicians at the time put samples of these noises into their songs, and I know why: they\u2019re weird and distorted and nonsensical, but they\u2019re also instantly resonant. They\u2019re the sounds of excitement, just around the corner.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The first time I ever put a 5\u00bc-inch disk into an Apple II drive to play Lode Runner, I was hooked. It seemed wildly futuristic \u2013 this was in the early 1980s \u2013 but there was also something pleasingly analogue about the process. You had to slide the disc from its sleeve like a vinyl record, then gently feed it into the mouth of the drive, before closing the little plastic door behind it with a satisfying click. The loading noise was a stuttering series of electronic snare drum taps, accompanied by the baseline hum of the computer itself. There was something almost organic about it, like a CT scan or ultrasound. To me it seemed incredible that typing something on a screen could cause the disk to start loading, as though I was talking to the computer, and the clicking noise only accentuated this feeling of communication. In these early days of video game playing, the actual game was only part of the experience \u2013 the allure began with the novelty of the loading process. The retrofuturistic noise of a disk drive still makes me wistful whenever I hear it on old movies and TV shows, or highly specialist YouTube videos such as this one: Veteran video game players may also remember, often with similarly warm nostalgia, the experience of loading a game on to a ZX Spectrum or Commodore 64. They came on cassette tapes, so you had that chunky, rattling sound as you grabbed the tape from its plastic case. Then there were all the noises we associate with tape players: the clunk of the eject button, sliding the tape in, pushing the lid back down. This sequence of actions, also familiar from playing music tapes, was hugely fetishised by teen movies of the era. If someone was going to play music in a 1980s movie, we\u2019d always get a closeup shot of the tape going in, the lid being closed and the play button being pressed. It meant something cool was coming. It was the same with video games. And pressing play was just the beginning. When a game started loading on a Speccy, the speaker would begin to emit a series of high-pitched screeching noises, like incredibly challenging electronic music \u2013 the literal sound of data, of ones and noughts, being rendered as audio. Experienced players got to know and understand the unique noises each of their games made, and could tell when they were about to finish loading from the tones being played. The sound was also freighted with tension because, if it stopped, it generally meant the process had crashed and you\u2019d have to start loading again \u2013 which could mean another five minutes of waiting. When you had friends over, all hoping to be the first to get a go on Way of the Exploding Fist, the tension was multiplied. You\u2019d all sit around the tape player like safe crackers, listening intently, hoping for the right clicks. The veteran games programmer Fred Williams, who wrote several classic titles for Codemasters, reminded me about \u2018The Chuntey\u2019, the name given by Spectrum fans to the invisible field surrounding the machine\u2019s cassette player into which only positive vibes could be admitted or else the process would break down. Loading was a religious ceremony and the sounds were sacrosanct. With consoles such as the NES and Mega Drive, the sounds were different again. Your games were on cartridges that came in big plastic boxes that opened with a satisfying thunk. You\u2019d have to lever them out of their holders and then jam your cartridge into the console port, hearing the ping of the cart\u2019s copper contacts easing into the input array. Carts were so hefty and present, like VHS tapes, and they often worryingly rattled a little bit too, which again gave gamers a clue about how long they were likely to last or why they weren\u2019t loading. Nowadays, all we hear is the soft whine as a DVD or Blu-Ray drive spins into motion. It\u2019s still a nice sound, but there is little variety and it doesn\u2019t give you as much feedback about the loading process. We can\u2019t speak or understand the language of loading any more. And many of us download games digitally anyway, so there is no sound at all. I really miss the early whirs, clicks and plasticky clunks of old video game systems. There was something so comforting about them. I remember reading an interview with Ridley Scott in which he talked about how the sounds of the life support systems coming online at the beginning of Alien were meant to resemble the noises babies hear in the womb. There is definitely something of that in old floppy disk drives, analogue monitors and processor fans. But for me, it\u2019s the grinding electronic dirge of the 8-bit computer loading screens that brings the most nostalgia. A few indie musicians at the time put samples of these noises into their songs, and I know why: they\u2019re weird and distorted and nonsensical, but they\u2019re also instantly resonant. They\u2019re the sounds of excitement, just around the corner.",

Tourists are arriving on the beach in droves, preparing to spend the day sunbathing and taking boat rides. Behind them, enormous marabou storks on spindly grey legs are pacing the beach, waiting for scraps.</p> <p>Nearby, a group of women scan the horizon, looking for the fishing boats that will soon arrive with their daily catch.</p> <p>But there\u2019s something else on the horizon too, a sheet of water hyacinth pulled over the surface of the lake. The leaves of the floating plant extending like an oversized green shag carpet, rolling gently in the wind.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a5f7873d68c8b382d6e5ca373b0d394c045a0133\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5f7873d68c8b382d6e5ca373b0d394c045a0133/0_6_594_356/500.jpg\" alt=\"Water hyacinth flowers are native to South America but have appeared in Africa since the 1990s.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Water hyacinth flowers are native to South America but have appeared in Africa since the 1990s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Auscape/UIG via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe hope that the boats arrive before the hyacinth covers this area, [because] it will be difficult for [the fishermen] to access the dry land and bring us fish,\u201d says Elizabeth Keita, a fishmonger in the village of Dunga, as she eyes the bobbing green sheet in the distance.</p> <p>Water hyacinth (<em>Eichhornia crassipes</em>), an aquatic plant native to South America, first appeared in countries in Africa in the early 1900s. Scientists there dubbed it the \u201cworld\u2019s worst aquatic weed\u201d, after it spread from the Cape in the early 1900s and started clogging up major dams and rivers.</p> <p>In east Africa, the nefarious invader arrived with Belgian colonists in Rwanda, who liked the look of its glossy leaves and delicate purple flowers floating in their garden ponds.</p> <p>But by the 1980s, it had slipped out of Rwanda via the Kagera river and made its way downstream to Lake Victoria.</p> <p>There, with no natural predators and perfect temperature conditions, the plant began gobbling up open space, choking off fishing routes and providing a new habitat for disease-carrying mosquitoes. But for women like Keita, it has meant dwindling income, as the boats that once brought silver lake fish to shore by the hundreds struggled to navigate the clogged waters.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4b86821f8efa3cbf1e61cdc032dee3ce97e93043\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b86821f8efa3cbf1e61cdc032dee3ce97e93043/0_0_5119_3413/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Women wait for fishermen to return with the catch, on the beach at Dunga village, near Kisumu, Kenya.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Women wait for fishermen to return with the catch, on the beach at Dunga village, near Kisumu, Kenya.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kirill Nikitin/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But water hyacinth isn\u2019t her only headache. Like most women here, to smoke the fish she buys, Keita must gather huge quantities of firewood, sometimes walking as far as 10km each way to collect enough kindling to complete her work. And each day as she cooks, she breathes in the thick, grey woodfire smoke.</p> <p>\u201cI have had chest complications a number of times in the last years,\u201d says Keita, who is chairperson of the local fishmongers\u2019 association.</p> <p>About three out of four families in Kenya depend on wood or charcoal to cook their daily meals, and the rate is even higher in rural areas, Kenya\u2019s latest demographic and health survey shows.</p> <p>Using solid fuels like these for cooking increases indoor pollution. The World Health Organization estimates that about <a href=\"http://www.environment.go.ke/?p=3298\">14,300 Kenyans</a> die annually from conditions linked to indoor air pollution \u2013 most of which is caused by cooking and heating sources, the most recent estimates released in 2009 show.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"db08bc6177920b7eafcc8bb09c6c0d8a6702780c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db08bc6177920b7eafcc8bb09c6c0d8a6702780c/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fishermen turn a boat on Lake Victoria, Kisumu, western Kenya.

But buried in those decaying waxy leaves was a renewable energy gold mine.</p> <p>It turns out the floating plant isn\u2019t just good at being abundant \u2013 its foliage also contains a high ratio of carbon to nitrogen.

      "bodyText": "It is 9am on the shores of Lake Victoria\u2019s Winam Gulf in Kenya\u2019s Kisumu county. Tourists are arriving on the beach in droves, preparing to spend the day sunbathing and taking boat rides. Behind them, enormous marabou storks on spindly grey legs are pacing the beach, waiting for scraps. Nearby, a group of women scan the horizon, looking for the fishing boats that will soon arrive with their daily catch. But there\u2019s something else on the horizon too, a sheet of water hyacinth pulled over the surface of the lake. The leaves of the floating plant extending like an oversized green shag carpet, rolling gently in the wind. \u201cWe hope that the boats arrive before the hyacinth covers this area, [because] it will be difficult for [the fishermen] to access the dry land and bring us fish,\u201d says Elizabeth Keita, a fishmonger in the village of Dunga, as she eyes the bobbing green sheet in the distance. Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), an aquatic plant native to South America, first appeared in countries in Africa in the early 1900s. Scientists there dubbed it the \u201cworld\u2019s worst aquatic weed\u201d, after it spread from the Cape in the early 1900s and started clogging up major dams and rivers. In east Africa, the nefarious invader arrived with Belgian colonists in Rwanda, who liked the look of its glossy leaves and delicate purple flowers floating in their garden ponds. But by the 1980s, it had slipped out of Rwanda via the Kagera river and made its way downstream to Lake Victoria. There, with no natural predators and perfect temperature conditions, the plant began gobbling up open space, choking off fishing routes and providing a new habitat for disease-carrying mosquitoes. But for women like Keita, it has meant dwindling income, as the boats that once brought silver lake fish to shore by the hundreds struggled to navigate the clogged waters. But water hyacinth isn\u2019t her only headache. Like most women here, to smoke the fish she buys, Keita must gather huge quantities of firewood, sometimes walking as far as 10km each way to collect enough kindling to complete her work. And each day as she cooks, she breathes in the thick, grey woodfire smoke. \u201cI have had chest complications a number of times in the last years,\u201d says Keita, who is chairperson of the local fishmongers\u2019 association. About three out of four families in Kenya depend on wood or charcoal to cook their daily meals, and the rate is even higher in rural areas, Kenya\u2019s latest demographic and health survey shows. Using solid fuels like these for cooking increases indoor pollution. The World Health Organization estimates that about 14,300 Kenyans die annually from conditions linked to indoor air pollution \u2013 most of which is caused by cooking and heating sources, the most recent estimates released in 2009 show. Outside Keita\u2019s home on the shores of Lake Victoria, piles of cleared water hyacinth left to rot were a common site. But buried in those decaying waxy leaves was a renewable energy gold mine. It turns out the floating plant isn\u2019t just good at being abundant \u2013 its foliage also contains a high ratio of carbon to nitrogen. It\u2019s a magic combination that has captivated researchers\u2019 imaginations since as early as the 1980s when, across the world, they began to explore its potential as a biofuel. Just about 4kg of the dried plant was enough to cater for a large family\u2019s daily energy needs, early research predicted. In 2014, Nigerian academics announced they had got better yields of the gas when they mixed the plant with sanitised chicken manure.

In 2018, the technology came to Dunga promising a two-for-one solution to the dual menaces of the water hyacinth and dependence on firewood. The community received two donated biogas digesters \u2013 machines that would transform a mix of water hyacinth and cow dung into biogas for cooking, as well as material for other household tasks such as incubating chicks and purifying water.

From there, the clean-burning gas is piped to the point of use, just like traditional domestic gas. Currently, there are about 50 of these biogas digesters slated for Kenya. In Dunga, some are connected to multiple family stoves so that altogether they produce enough gas to serve about 60% of the village\u2019s population. Kenya\u2019s Biogas International company installed the stoves in partnership with the pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca and the University of Cambridge\u2019s Institute for Sustainability. The project will test whether biogas can provide an effective alternative to firewood and charcoal in rural Kenyan communities. The programme is only months old but, anecdotally, it seems to be working. Keita says the members of her fishmongers\u2019 association are already getting sick less often.

At its simplest, the book argues that to be an antiracist is to take an active and persistent stance against racism.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2019/aug/14/ibram-x-kendi-racist-ideas-have-always-been-murderous\" title=\"\">In Kendi\u2019s conception, words and phrases that obscure the offence</a> \u2013 unconscious bias, microaggressions and others \u2013 should make way for clearer-eyed definitions.</p> \n<p>Rather than institutionalised racism, which always takes some unpacking from the abstract, let\u2019s call out the active ingredient: racist policy. Kendi believes that \u201cwe become unconscious to racist policymakers and policies as we lash out angrily at the abstract bogeyman of the \u2018system\u2019\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Kendi places himself at the centre of the argument, exploring how black people have also been seduced by racist ideology</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>But it\u2019s not just white people whose prejudicial thoughts and actions have been affected by racism. Kendi places himself front and centre of the argument, exploring how black people, too, have been seduced by racist ideology, owning up to his misguided adoption as a youth of the \u201cvirtuous/reprehensible black man\u201d dichotomy, in which he distanced himself from those African Americans considered to be unworthy and guilty of letting down the race. The teenage Kendi avoids stepping on the \u201ckicks\u201d (trainers) of other black boys \u201clike they were landmines\u201d. Fed on noxious mainstream media tropes and propaganda about \u201cghetto blacks\u201d and the \u201cgrowing army of super-predators\u201d, he describes being \u201cstalked inside my head by racist ideas\u201d.</p> \n<p>Poor racist whites have also been \u201cplayed\u201d by the establishment, buoyed, writes Kendi, by the notion that \u201cI may not be rich, but at least I am not black\u201d. In the 1960s, US president Lyndon B Johnson expanded on that pitiable belief: \u201cIf you can convince the lowest white man he\u2019s better than the best coloured man, he won\u2019t notice you\u2019re picking his pocket. Hell, give him somebody to look down on, and he\u2019ll empty his pockets for you.\u201d</p> \n<p>Writing calmly but insightfully in a series of brisk chapters, Kendi teases out the evolution of racism \u2013 from its historical underpinning and providing cover for the \u201ccivilising mission\u201d of slavery and colonisation, through to the present, so-called \u201cacademic achievement gap\u201d between black and white students, and the allegedly neutral standardised tests that serve as \u201cthe linchpin of a racist idea of behavioural racism\u201d.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, racism is not the product of hatred and ignorance but, rather, the design of \u201cracist power [to exploit] out of raw self-interest\u201d, Kendi asserts. He cites cynical voter registration suppression techniques as a clear example in the 2000 presidential election of George W Bush, which was determined by the disqualification of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/dec/04/uselections2000.usa1\" title=\"\">thousands of votes from black people in Florida</a>.</p> \n<p>In the course of <em>How to Be an Antiracist</em>, Kendi moves from his rigid framework and selective perception of the inequalities endured by black people as primarily explained through the prism of race; he\u2019s increasingly inclined towards the view held by Martin Luther King Jr \u2013 espoused in his Poor People\u2019s Campaign \u2013 of the intersection of racism with capitalism. Further, to be an antiracist is to challenge spurious (if perhaps well-intentioned) notions such as the \u201cculture of poverty\u201d, which allegedly traps impoverished black people in dependency \u2013 in opposition to, and ignorant of, the \u201cculture of work\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe can\u2019t let these conversations devolve into the impotent simplicity of who is or isn\u2019t a racist,\u201d said the African American senator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/04/cory-booker-trump-el-paso-white-supremacy-hatred\" title=\"\">Cory Booker</a> in the aftermath of the mass shootings in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/05/el-paso-dayton-victims-death-toll-shooting\" title=\"\">US cities of Dayton and El Paso</a>. Booker spoke movingly of this \u201cmoral moment\u201d at the Emanuel AME church in Charleston, where four years ago a white supremacist shot and killed several of the congregation. Echoing Kendi\u2019s call to action, he argued: \u201cIf the answer to the question \u2018Do racism and white supremacy exist?\u2019 is yes, then the real question isn\u2019t who is or isn\u2019t a racist, but who is and isn\u2019t doing something about it?\u201d</p> \n<p>This vital book asks those same age-old questions: When does silence become complicity? Why do we fear taking action more than the devastating consequences of inaction? Kendi\u2019s writing is a search for a language to enable the antiracist that resides in all of us. Towards the end, the 37-year-old scholar draws on the analogy of fighting the colon cancer that has threatened his own young life. <em>How to Be an Antiracist</em> encourages self-reflection on the compelling truth: \u201cRacism has always been terminal and curable.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>This review is from the Observer</em></p> \n<p>\u2022 <em>How to Be an Antiracist </em>by Ibram X Kendi<em> </em>is published by Bodley Head (\u00a316.99).

Kendi believes that \u201cwe become unconscious to racist policymakers and policies as we lash out angrily at the abstract bogeyman of the \u2018system\u2019\u201d. But it\u2019s not just white people whose prejudicial thoughts and actions have been affected by racism. Kendi places himself front and centre of the argument, exploring how black people, too, have been seduced by racist ideology, owning up to his misguided adoption as a youth of the \u201cvirtuous/reprehensible black man\u201d dichotomy, in which he distanced himself from those African Americans considered to be unworthy and guilty of letting down the race. The teenage Kendi avoids stepping on the \u201ckicks\u201d (trainers) of other black boys \u201clike they were landmines\u201d. Fed on noxious mainstream media tropes and propaganda about \u201cghetto blacks\u201d and the \u201cgrowing army of super-predators\u201d, he describes being \u201cstalked inside my head by racist ideas\u201d. Poor racist whites have also been \u201cplayed\u201d by the establishment, buoyed, writes Kendi, by the notion that \u201cI may not be rich, but at least I am not black\u201d. In the 1960s, US president Lyndon B Johnson expanded on that pitiable belief: \u201cIf you can convince the lowest white man he\u2019s better than the best coloured man, he won\u2019t notice you\u2019re picking his pocket. Hell, give him somebody to look down on, and he\u2019ll empty his pockets for you.\u201d Writing calmly but insightfully in a series of brisk chapters, Kendi teases out the evolution of racism \u2013 from its historical underpinning and providing cover for the \u201ccivilising mission\u201d of slavery and colonisation, through to the present, so-called \u201cacademic achievement gap\u201d between black and white students, and the allegedly neutral standardised tests that serve as \u201cthe linchpin of a racist idea of behavioural racism\u201d. Ultimately, racism is not the product of hatred and ignorance but, rather, the design of \u201cracist power [to exploit] out of raw self-interest\u201d, Kendi asserts. He cites cynical voter registration suppression techniques as a clear example in the 2000 presidential election of George W Bush, which was determined by the disqualification of thousands of votes from black people in Florida. In the course of How to Be an Antiracist, Kendi moves from his rigid framework and selective perception of the inequalities endured by black people as primarily explained through the prism of race; he\u2019s increasingly inclined towards the view held by Martin Luther King Jr \u2013 espoused in his Poor People\u2019s Campaign \u2013 of the intersection of racism with capitalism. Further, to be an antiracist is to challenge spurious (if perhaps well-intentioned) notions such as the \u201cculture of poverty\u201d, which allegedly traps impoverished black people in dependency \u2013 in opposition to, and ignorant of, the \u201cculture of work\u201d. \u201cWe can\u2019t let these conversations devolve into the impotent simplicity of who is or isn\u2019t a racist,\u201d said the African American senator Cory Booker in the aftermath of the mass shootings in the US cities of Dayton and El Paso. Booker spoke movingly of this \u201cmoral moment\u201d at the Emanuel AME church in Charleston, where four years ago a white supremacist shot and killed several of the congregation. Echoing Kendi\u2019s call to action, he argued: \u201cIf the answer to the question \u2018Do racism and white supremacy exist?\u2019 is yes, then the real question isn\u2019t who is or isn\u2019t a racist, but who is and isn\u2019t doing something about it?\u201d This vital book asks those same age-old questions: When does silence become complicity? Why do we fear taking action more than the devastating consequences of inaction? Kendi\u2019s writing is a search for a language to enable the antiracist that resides in all of us. Towards the end, the 37-year-old scholar draws on the analogy of fighting the colon cancer that has threatened his own young life. How to Be an Antiracist encourages self-reflection on the compelling truth: \u201cRacism has always been terminal and curable.\u201d This review is from the Observer \u2022 How to Be an Antiracist by Ibram X Kendi is published by Bodley Head (\u00a316.99).

But my older sister gave me some advice: not to think about all the negative stuff, but to think instead about the good stuff, like how I will find new friends and meet some nice new teachers.</p> <p>All my teachers were encouraging, but there\u2019s one who sticks out: Miss Bailey, my RE teacher. She always had a smile on her face when she greeted us. She\u2019s really calm and kind and the work she gave us wasn\u2019t too overwhelming. </p> <p>If I were to go back in time, my advice to myself would be: don\u2019t overthink the whole process of making friends. I thought it would be hard for me because normally I like sticking with the people I know. But friends I knew from primary school introduced me to new friends they had made, who were really encouraging. I\u2019d meet them and we\u2019d just sort of click. Within a couple of weeks, I realised I\u2019d made all these new friends all by myself.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Douglas Finch,</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Oxford Spires in east Oxford</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"fd0d6ff86d3401caf9ce56ecf784a079c0dc731b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd0d6ff86d3401caf9ce56ecf784a079c0dc731b/289_766_2407_2407/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Douglas Finch\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Douglas Finch</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NONE</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you need to actively try hard to make friends. You\u2019ll be in classes together and so will have to talk to them, out of necessity. And if you don\u2019t make many new friends, it won\u2019t be much of a problem. You don\u2019t need 20 people you can reliably talk to. You\u2019ll be fine with a few that you like.</p> <p>The simple solution if you get lost is to ask an older child to explain where you should go. Often, they will be perfectly friendly. Unless they\u2019re terrible people, they won\u2019t be saying to each other: let\u2019s go terrify those year 7s.</p> <p>Some teachers can be quite strict, but I get a lot more done in the lessons I have with them. Besides, if you don\u2019t disrupt a lesson, it doesn\u2019t really matter whether the teacher is strict or not.</p> <p>The one thing you have to worry about is the long-term homework projects. The general rule I\u2019ve found is: if the teacher thinks the homework will take half an hour, it will take less time. But if the teacher says it will take an hour, it will probably take longer.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Tyler Jolly, North Cambridge </strong><strong>academy</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e6e015cdbd25e0fd915e85a763b5b0deffbcd852\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6e015cdbd25e0fd915e85a763b5b0deffbcd852/492_283_1848_1846/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tyler Jolly\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tyler Jolly</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jill Mead/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cBefore I arrived, I thought I would get homework every single day and everyone said it would be really difficult.

      "bodyText": "Chelsy Reyes, North Cambridge academy \u201cI was worried about making friends and finding my way around. But my older sister gave me some advice: not to think about all the negative stuff, but to think instead about the good stuff, like how I will find new friends and meet some nice new teachers. All my teachers were encouraging, but there\u2019s one who sticks out: Miss Bailey, my RE teacher. She always had a smile on her face when she greeted us. She\u2019s really calm and kind and the work she gave us wasn\u2019t too overwhelming. If I were to go back in time, my advice to myself would be: don\u2019t overthink the whole process of making friends. I thought it would be hard for me because normally I like sticking with the people I know. But friends I knew from primary school introduced me to new friends they had made, who were really encouraging. I\u2019d meet them and we\u2019d just sort of click. Within a couple of weeks, I realised I\u2019d made all these new friends all by myself.\u201d Douglas Finch, Oxford Spires in east Oxford \u201cI don\u2019t think you need to actively try hard to make friends. You\u2019ll be in classes together and so will have to talk to them, out of necessity. And if you don\u2019t make many new friends, it won\u2019t be much of a problem. You don\u2019t need 20 people you can reliably talk to. You\u2019ll be fine with a few that you like. The simple solution if you get lost is to ask an older child to explain where you should go. Often, they will be perfectly friendly. Unless they\u2019re terrible people, they won\u2019t be saying to each other: let\u2019s go terrify those year 7s. Some teachers can be quite strict, but I get a lot more done in the lessons I have with them. Besides, if you don\u2019t disrupt a lesson, it doesn\u2019t really matter whether the teacher is strict or not. The one thing you have to worry about is the long-term homework projects. The general rule I\u2019ve found is: if the teacher thinks the homework will take half an hour, it will take less time. But if the teacher says it will take an hour, it will probably take longer.\u201d Tyler Jolly, North Cambridge academy \u201cBefore I arrived, I thought I would get homework every single day and everyone said it would be really difficult. But I discovered that the homework was actually quite easy and it can be really fun. People also told me the teachers at secondary school are horrible. But they were really kind \u2013 especially Mr Kelly, my head of year. I think sometimes older kids try to make you scared of year 7, so that you don\u2019t want to go.

      "body": "<p>In September 2016, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/02/hurricane-hermine-flooding-florida-georgia-storm\">Hurricane Hermine</a> bearing down on North Carolina, Kemp Burdette rented a single-engine plane and flew over Duplin county. Burdette, a riverkeeper with the environmental group Cape Fear River Watch, was worried that some of the local pig farmers might try to drain their manure lagoons before the rains hit, to prevent them from overflowing. Spraying waste is illegal just before storms because of the risk that runoff from saturated fields will contaminate waterways.</p> <p>As he flew, Burdette estimated that he saw at least 35 farms spraying their fields. He took high-resolution, GPS-stamped <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/waterkeeperalliance/albums/72157672119077560\">photographs and videos</a> documenting the apparent violations, and then filed a complaint with the state Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), hoping the evidence would move the agency to act. He and his colleagues did the same <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/waterkeeperalliance/albums/72157673640500543\">a month later</a>, just before the devastating Hurricane Matthew. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just one bad actor,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was widespread \u2013 complete disregard for the rules.\u201d</p> <p>But, according to Burdette, DEQ told him that the images were inadequate proof. \u201cThey were basically saying, \u2018There\u2019s nothing we can do,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThey can\u2019t stand behind evidence collected by somebody else.\u201d Nor did they have funds to do their own aerial surveys. For evidence, DEQ said it could only review the farms\u2019 self-reported spray logs. And in November 2016, when Burdette and his colleagues followed up, they say all public traces of their complaints had disappeared.</p> <p>For years, residents say, North Carolina regulators shielded the identities of polluting farms, burying public complaints against them and leaving those who lived nearby with few avenues for redress. Neighbours said their complaints were going unheard.</p> <p>A joint investigation by the Guardian, the <a href=\"https://thefern.org/\">Food &amp; Environment Reporting Network</a>, and the <a href=\"https://investigatemidwest.org/\">Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting</a> backs up residents\u2019 assessments. In response to a public records request, DEQ released only 33 public complaints against livestock operations in North Carolina from January 2008 to April 2018. Over the same period, other hog states have registered thousands.</p> <p>Abruptly, in April 2019 the DEQ said it had validated <a href=\"https://files.nc.gov/ncdeq/Water%20Resources/Animalops/AFO-Website-Nov2018-thru-April-2019-Data-FINAL2.pdf\">62 complaints</a> against animal operations over a six-month period and posted them online. The offenders included 11 industrial hog farms, some of which had let their waste discharge into ditches and streams. </p> <p>State regulators had publicly documented nearly twice as many violations in the six months prior to April 2019 than in an entire decade. What happened?</p> <h2>Explosive growth of the hog industry</h2> <p>Raising hogs in North Carolina used to be a side gig to the real business of growing tobacco and cotton. Then, in the 1980s and 90s, the industry exploded, with concentrated animal feeding operations (Cafos) on the state\u2019s coastal plain housing up to 60,000 animals each. Most of the state\u2019s 9 million pigs live indoors, their waste flushed through slats into open pits called lagoons. When the lagoons get too full, the waste is sprayed onto crop fields as fertiliser, though these manure pits have also been known to overflow and breach their walls, particularly during hurricanes.<br><br>As the industry grew, the state legislature <a href=\"https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/news-observer-raleigh-nc\">protected it</a> in numerous ways, even barring counties from restricting hog farms during the key expansion years. But lawmakers couldn\u2019t ignore the mounting hog waste, particularly when it polluted waterways.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It smells like a body that\u2019s been decomposed for a month</p> <footer> <cite>Duplin County resident</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In 1997, the legislature imposed a suspension on new farms using lagoon-and-sprayfield systems: in 2007 it made the ban permanent, essentially capping the number of hog farms at around 2,300. But existing industrial farms were allowed to continue business as usual, despite widespread evidence that they were fouling the rural landscape and making for noxious neighbours.</p> <p>\u201cIt smells like a body that\u2019s been decomposed for a month,\u201d says Rene Miller, a retired truck driver from Duplin County, the heart of hog country. On Sundays after church, her family used to gather under the oak tree beside the house. They would dance, play checkers, and eat fried chicken, collard greens and corn. \u201cThat was my life back then,\u201d she said. Now, with hog waste sprayed onto a field across the road, she stays inside with the air-conditioning cranked up.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/03/is-the-us-chicken-industry-cheating-its-farmers\">Is the US chicken industry cheating its farmers?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A study <a href=\"http://www.ncmedicaljournal.com/content/79/5/278.full.pdf+html\">published in 2018</a> by the North Carolina Medical Journal concluded that families living near hog CAFOs saw higher rates of infant mortality and deaths from anaemia, kidney disease, and tuberculosis. Another <a href=\"http://www.ncpolicywatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/UNC-Report.pdf\">study</a>, from 2014, found these issues \u201cdisproportionately affect\u201d people of colour: African Americans, Native Americans, and Latinos are far more likely to live near CAFOs.</p> <p>The North Carolina Pork Council declined an interview request, but has in the past<a href=\"http://www.ncpork.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/The-Truth-of-the-Matter.pdf\"> criticised</a> the study from 2014. In comments submitted to DEQ last March, the council also noted that the 2018 North Carolina Medical Journal study came from a research programme at Duke University that received funding from a critic of factory farming.</p> <p>The industry insists that health concerns are exaggerated. \u201cWe don\u2019t think these types of symptoms or things are going on in the communities where we do business,\u201d Kraig Westerbeek, a senior director at Smithfield Foods, the world\u2019s largest pork producer and the state\u2019s dominant player, said in a deposition in reference to an <a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.523.518&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\">older study</a> that had found increased depression, anger, and confusion among neighbours who experienced hog-farm odours. \u201cThere are studies that can say almost anything,\u201d he added.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c8c0ffdef2ac11982baf8604b5b2deb805b6fcbb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8c0ffdef2ac11982baf8604b5b2deb805b6fcbb/0_173_5184_3109/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A manure waste pond on a farm in North Carolina\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A manure waste pond on a farm in North Carolina.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gerry Broome/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>An underfunded agency</h2> <p>The ban on lagoons and spraying only applies to new farms. Meanwhile, North Carolina\u2019s legislators appear to have continued to protect existing farms and discourage neighbours from seeking help. In 2014, for example, they passed a law keeping complaints filed with the state environmental agency <a href=\"https://www.ncleg.gov/Sessions/2013/Bills/House/PDF/H366v7.pdf\">confidential</a> unless the department \u201cdetermines that a violation has occurred\u201d. State representative Jimmy Dixon said the provision was designed to protect farmers from false accusations.</p> <p>\u201cWe fully expect and desire to have any violations known and exposed,\u201d the Duplin County Republican and semi-retired poultry farmer said in an interview. \u201cBut just to throw it wide open for every Tom, Dick and Harry to make unsubstantiated claims, like some of the people do \u2013 we believe that there is an inherent expectation that I should be determined to be innocent until proven to be guilty.\u201d</p> <p>DEQ interpreted the law to require disclosure of a complaint only when there\u2019s a formal violation notice or penalty, which the agency has historically been loth to initiate. \u201cWe believe [that] if they find a violation of the permit, they just tell the operator, \u2018Hey, this doesn\u2019t look right.

      "bodyText": "In September 2016, with Hurricane Hermine bearing down on North Carolina, Kemp Burdette rented a single-engine plane and flew over Duplin county. Burdette, a riverkeeper with the environmental group Cape Fear River Watch, was worried that some of the local pig farmers might try to drain their manure lagoons before the rains hit, to prevent them from overflowing. Spraying waste is illegal just before storms because of the risk that runoff from saturated fields will contaminate waterways. As he flew, Burdette estimated that he saw at least 35 farms spraying their fields. He took high-resolution, GPS-stamped photographs and videos documenting the apparent violations, and then filed a complaint with the state Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), hoping the evidence would move the agency to act. He and his colleagues did the same a month later, just before the devastating Hurricane Matthew. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just one bad actor,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was widespread \u2013 complete disregard for the rules.\u201d But, according to Burdette, DEQ told him that the images were inadequate proof. \u201cThey were basically saying, \u2018There\u2019s nothing we can do,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThey can\u2019t stand behind evidence collected by somebody else.\u201d Nor did they have funds to do their own aerial surveys. For evidence, DEQ said it could only review the farms\u2019 self-reported spray logs. And in November 2016, when Burdette and his colleagues followed up, they say all public traces of their complaints had disappeared. For years, residents say, North Carolina regulators shielded the identities of polluting farms, burying public complaints against them and leaving those who lived nearby with few avenues for redress. Neighbours said their complaints were going unheard. A joint investigation by the Guardian, the Food &amp; Environment Reporting Network, and the Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting backs up residents\u2019 assessments. In response to a public records request, DEQ released only 33 public complaints against livestock operations in North Carolina from January 2008 to April 2018. Over the same period, other hog states have registered thousands. Abruptly, in April 2019 the DEQ said it had validated 62 complaints against animal operations over a six-month period and posted them online. The offenders included 11 industrial hog farms, some of which had let their waste discharge into ditches and streams. State regulators had publicly documented nearly twice as many violations in the six months prior to April 2019 than in an entire decade. What happened? Explosive growth of the hog industry Raising hogs in North Carolina used to be a side gig to the real business of growing tobacco and cotton. Then, in the 1980s and 90s, the industry exploded, with concentrated animal feeding operations (Cafos) on the state\u2019s coastal plain housing up to 60,000 animals each. Most of the state\u2019s 9 million pigs live indoors, their waste flushed through slats into open pits called lagoons. When the lagoons get too full, the waste is sprayed onto crop fields as fertiliser, though these manure pits have also been known to overflow and breach their walls, particularly during hurricanes. As the industry grew, the state legislature protected it in numerous ways, even barring counties from restricting hog farms during the key expansion years. But lawmakers couldn\u2019t ignore the mounting hog waste, particularly when it polluted waterways. In 1997, the legislature imposed a suspension on new farms using lagoon-and-sprayfield systems: in 2007 it made the ban permanent, essentially capping the number of hog farms at around 2,300. But existing industrial farms were allowed to continue business as usual, despite widespread evidence that they were fouling the rural landscape and making for noxious neighbours. \u201cIt smells like a body that\u2019s been decomposed for a month,\u201d says Rene Miller, a retired truck driver from Duplin County, the heart of hog country. On Sundays after church, her family used to gather under the oak tree beside the house. They would dance, play checkers, and eat fried chicken, collard greens and corn. \u201cThat was my life back then,\u201d she said. Now, with hog waste sprayed onto a field across the road, she stays inside with the air-conditioning cranked up. A study published in 2018 by the North Carolina Medical Journal concluded that families living near hog CAFOs saw higher rates of infant mortality and deaths from anaemia, kidney disease, and tuberculosis. Another study, from 2014, found these issues \u201cdisproportionately affect\u201d people of colour: African Americans, Native Americans, and Latinos are far more likely to live near CAFOs. The North Carolina Pork Council declined an interview request, but has in the past criticised the study from 2014. In comments submitted to DEQ last March, the council also noted that the 2018 North Carolina Medical Journal study came from a research programme at Duke University that received funding from a critic of factory farming. The industry insists that health concerns are exaggerated. \u201cWe don\u2019t think these types of symptoms or things are going on in the communities where we do business,\u201d Kraig Westerbeek, a senior director at Smithfield Foods, the world\u2019s largest pork producer and the state\u2019s dominant player, said in a deposition in reference to an older study that had found increased depression, anger, and confusion among neighbours who experienced hog-farm odours. \u201cThere are studies that can say almost anything,\u201d he added. An underfunded agency The ban on lagoons and spraying only applies to new farms. Meanwhile, North Carolina\u2019s legislators appear to have continued to protect existing farms and discourage neighbours from seeking help. In 2014, for example, they passed a law keeping complaints filed with the state environmental agency confidential unless the department \u201cdetermines that a violation has occurred\u201d. State representative Jimmy Dixon said the provision was designed to protect farmers from false accusations. \u201cWe fully expect and desire to have any violations known and exposed,\u201d the Duplin County Republican and semi-retired poultry farmer said in an interview. \u201cBut just to throw it wide open for every Tom, Dick and Harry to make unsubstantiated claims, like some of the people do \u2013 we believe that there is an inherent expectation that I should be determined to be innocent until proven to be guilty.\u201d DEQ interpreted the law to require disclosure of a complaint only when there\u2019s a formal violation notice or penalty, which the agency has historically been loth to initiate. \u201cWe believe [that] if they find a violation of the permit, they just tell the operator, \u2018Hey, this doesn\u2019t look right. You need to address it,\u2019\u201d says Elizabeth Haddix, managing attorney at the North Carolina office of the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which represents some of DEQ\u2019s critics. \u201cThey may not make any written record of that violation.\u201d This is how, until recently, complaints vanished. It also helps explain why the agency located only 33 complaint records for a period of more than a decade, when queried by the Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting. Other states with major livestock industries had far more: Nebraska provided 2,131 complaints; Georgia 5,652; and Texas 6,411. Iowa, the top hog producing state, provided 2,393. The North Carolina Pork Council, in a 2019 letter to DEQ, said the \u201crelatively minimal number of violations\u201d in the state signalled \u201ca robust and working regulatory system\u201d. But even careful documentation hasn\u2019t guaranteed enforcement in North Carolina.

      "bodyText": "The BBC wildlife series Serengeti is an odd duck. If you haven\u2019t seen it, it\u2019s a dramatisation of a wildlife show. Masterminded by Pop Idol creator Simon Fuller, it contains real wildlife footage that\u2019s been shaped into narratives by writers. Multiple animals represent the same character. John Boyega is credited as a \u201cstoryteller\u201d rather than a \u201cnarrator\u201d. My colleague Rebecca Nicholson called Serengeti \u201cthe Made in Chelsea of nature docs\u201d for good reason. To watch it is to watch the raw majesty of the natural world being smothered to death by human emotion. This weekend, the show was hit by accusations that it inserted a composite shot of a zebra being swept down a river to heighten the drama of a scene. Serengeti is a bold experiment into humanity\u2019s tolerance of anthropomorphism. If it had worked, similar tactics could have been used to heighten awareness of the climate emergency, maybe by letting James Corden provide the voice of a glacier as it crumbles into the sea. But it doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s really weird. The incredible thing about wildlife documentaries is how invested you become in the subjects. I had such a visceral reaction to the Blue Planet 2 sequence where a marine iguana ran for its life from a teeming horde of snakes that I almost burst into tears when I saw one in a conservation park a couple of months ago. And, yes, that series benefited from beautiful photography, snappy editing and a pounding Hans Zimmer score, but it still managed to capture something as elemental as the frantic struggle for survival. That\u2019s what viewers respond to \u2013 not a vague sensation that they are watching an episode of Hollyoaks Pets. And on the subject of animals \u2026 Seagulls are awful. They have managed to get away with it for years, but now one of them has attacked beloved children\u2019s entertainer Dave Benson Phillips, the public has reached a tipping point. There is serious talk of a cull. \u201cLet local communities take action against the fat, aggressive urban sods,\u201d John Woodcock MP said recently. Frankly, seagulls have brought this on themselves. It isn\u2019t enough that they divebomb pensioners for their chips; they also have the temerity to look and sound like characters from an ill-advised Pixar film about birds that enter the violent world of football hooliganism. Never has an animal been more in need of a makeover. The petition to get all seagulls Queer Eyed starts here.",

      "bodyText": "Florida\u2019s record as a vital swing state made it a target for meddling in the 2016 election when Russians breached two county voting systems and a software vendor and now concerns are being raised about voting security in the state for the 2020 ballot, say election and cyber security experts, federal reports and Democrats. With FBI director Christopher Wray and other intelligence officials predicting more Russian and possibly other foreign interference in the next elections, experts say Florida is again a likely target for Russian hackers, or others bent on disrupting voting, which potentially could alter tallies and create other problems. \u201cObviously, Florida will be a critical state in 2020 and Florida election officials should assume they will be targeted again,\u201d said Larry Norden, who runs the election reform program at the Brennan Center for Justice. Election security experts are concerned about several potential problem areas, including software that stores sensitive voter registration data, the short timetable for any post-election audits and Florida\u2019s history of voting snafus.

Moreover, other election security problems in Florida were underscored by the Mueller and the Senate intelligence reports, which undercut previous statements from Florida officials about the security of their elections. While the Senate intelligence report doesn\u2019t name Florida, it refers to a \u201cstate #2\u201d which analysts say matches what Mueller\u2019s report first disclosed: Russian intelligence breached two counties\u2019 electronic voting systems. Although no evidence has surfaced that the two counties\u2019 vote totals were changed, the senate report says Russian hacking gained access to sensitive information. Florida officials are portrayed in the senate report as in the dark about what happened in the counties, and wary of sharing information on the state\u2019s cybersecurity measures. The report, for instance, quoted the Florida election director telling the committee in a conference call in late 2017 that there was \u201c\u2018never an attack on our systems\u2019 and \u2018We did not see any unusual activities. I would have known about it personally,\u2019\u201d the report says. And the report said that Florida \u201cdid not want to share with the Committee its cybersecurity posture, but state officials communicated that they are highly confident in the security of their systems\u201d. For their part, Florida officials last month announced $2.3m in election security grants to 55 counties that applied for them, and have touted their network monitoring sensors, which are considered good tools to detect foreign hacking But Florida Democratic congresswoman Stephanie Murphy has criticized officials for their slow release of details about what happened in 2016, and their continuing failure to disclose which counties the Russians targeted. \u201cThis unwillingness by our federal agencies and county election officials to be forthcoming with information will only undermine public confidence in the integrity of our election systems,\u201d Murphy said in a statement. Other Democrats and experts are urging Florida to take more steps to thwart potential problems in 2020. Wyden has suggested Florida \u201cfollow the lead of states like Virginia and Colorado and switch to a paper-ballot system with automatic risk-limiting audits, which experts widely agree is the most secure way to vote\u201d. Wyden added that \u201cthe state doesn\u2019t require routine, rigorous post-election audits, which means it could be impossible to detect if the state\u2019s elections are hacked\u201d. Another concern of Robert Anderson, the CEO of Cyber Defense Labs in Texas and an ex-FBI official overseeing criminal and cyber inquiries, is Florida\u2019s problems with vote counting going back as far as 2000\u2019s hotly contested presidential election which makes it a \u201cstrategic intelligence target\u201d for foreign interference. \u201cFlorida has had ongoing voter tabulation issues that could allow a foreign actor like Russia the ability to penetrate their systems and obfuscate their movements,\u201d Anderson said.",

      "body": "<p>My favourite Jakartan is Evi Mariani Sofian. It\u2019s not just because she knows the city\u2019s spiciest fish restaurants, cheerfully brings her seven-year-old son along on her <a href=\"https://medium.com/@evimariani/telum-talks-to-evi-mariani-managing-editor-the-jakarta-post-dbc833c52391\">assignments for the Jakarta Post</a>, where she is managing editor, and relishes a bit of good-natured ribbing at the expense of naive journalists visiting from London. Rather, at the risk of sounding grandiose, one hot day when Sofian took me to the city\u2019s waterfront she showed me a new kind of journalism.</p> <p>Thousands of residents of Jakarta had been living for decades on the waterfront, in what the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/nov/28/slum-loaded-term-homegrown-neighbourhoods-mumbai-dharavi\">authorities call slums</a>. Certainly, they live in homes built with their own hands, denied access to municipal services such as electricity and running water, and supporting themselves informally, through fishing, kiosks and services such as cutting hair.</p> <p>They were told the bulldozers weren\u2019t coming \u2013 but one night they did anyway, crushing the neighbourhood into a field of grey rubble. Grimly Sofian led me across a landscape that in devastation, though not of course in body count, rivalled the scenes then playing out in Syria. She introduced me to the men and women who\u2019d lived here their whole lives, and whose world had been destroyed overnight because hotel developers wanted to build a chain of islands that would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/nov/22/jakarta-great-garuda-seawall-sinking\">look from space</a> like a giant mythical eagle.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb88434319dd4aea55fc9c3d498d9abbe7a8ac55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb88434319dd4aea55fc9c3d498d9abbe7a8ac55/98_228_1270_762/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Michael on stage\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Michael, Guardian Cities editor, on stage at the Deportivo Chavos Banda community centre in Iztapalapa, Mexico City, in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marta Bausells</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some of the residents had rebuilt new shacks, on the same spot, using the very rubble of their bulldozed homes \u2013 an almost crazed but entirely human determination that floors me as much today as it did then. To Sofian, it was Jakarta\u2019s most important story: about who has the right to the city. But nobody had died, it wasn\u2019t a campaign issue, and in many other ways it wasn\u2019t the kind of story we might have told before Guardian Cities launched in 2014.</p> <p>The statistic you always heard back then was that 50% of the world now lived in cities, and by deciding to start a Cities desk the Guardian was jumping smartly on the opportunity to explore that other great 21st-century phenomenon, after the digital revolution: urbanisation. People were moving to cities in their billions, and most of the new growth was happening without a plan.</p> <p>The idea was for Cities to offer something different editorially from the political horse races and procession of fatalities that typically characterises the \u201cnews agenda\u201d, but it wasn\u2019t clear how. Fiery opinions? In-depth policy? Wonkish dissections of the minutiae of transportation planning? (Some readers still get annoyed that we don\u2019t do more of that.) The Atlantic magazine had started Atlantic Cities in 2011 but otherwise there wasn\u2019t really such a thing as \u201curban journalism\u201d.</p> <p>I fancied myself a global journalist, and had broken several stories on international issues \u2013 such as the <a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/2008/04/from-despotandx2019s-pr-man-to-surrey-salesman/\">North Korean regime spokesperson</a> who had tried to start a Glastonbury-style pop music festival in Pyongyang before defecting to Surrey, of all places, where I tracked him down in his new home above a Carphone Warehouse; or my first major scoop, when the members of an Ethiopian circus troupe revealed to me <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/jul/22/audreygillan1\">sexual abuse by their leader</a>, Marc Lachance, who led me, my mentor Marina Jimenez and Canadian police on a trail that ended in the Andes with his suicide.</p> <p>My only real qualification for a job on the Cities desk, however, was that I\u2019d lived and worked in four of them. Before London I\u2019d spent three years in Tokyo at the International New York Times tie-up with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asahi_Shimbun\">Asahi Shimbun</a>, and before that I ran a lifestyle magazine in Montreal and then Toronto with the LA-based <a href=\"https://noproblem.la/\">artist Alex DeJong</a>. (The magazine was called Trucker, and it borrowed Vice\u2019s business model \u2013 parties and American Apparel ads \u2013 without the seedier edge, an omission that I posit to explain why I\u2019m not living in a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/vice-ceo-shane-smith-buys-santa-monica-mansion-for-23-million-2015-8?r=US&amp;IR=T\">\u00a320m villa in Santa Monica</a>.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"378ba3ad4d46972239472850927aa1ac870b09a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/378ba3ad4d46972239472850927aa1ac870b09a1/0_71_1220_732/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Attenborough and Chris Michael\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Attenborough and Chris Michael in London during the Overstretched Cities series.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Geiger/Royal Canadian Geographical Society</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Luckily, Mike Herd, the founding Cities editor, was a firm believer that not being an expert in urbanism was an asset for telling stories about cities. Mike didn\u2019t want Cities to be a site for talking heads, or for politics, or for transport minutiae. He decided Cities would be, in his words, \u201clike the community wing of the foreign desk\u201d, and his biggest idea was the \u201clive week\u201d: our team would decamp for a week to a global megacity, but not to report on a city\u2019s issues for an audience back in London. Instead, we\u2019d give a platform to locals, to tell their own stories in their own words to their own community.</p> <p>It was, and remains, a phenomenally successful idea that I have doubled down on since becoming Cities editor. It is the heart of what \u201curban journalism\u201d has become at the Guardian: reported feature journalism, for global audiences, tackling the big issues of our time, from inequality to gentrification to how we move and live and work, without needing the justification of elections or death (although sometimes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/mar/13/life-death-growth-addis-ababa-racial-tensions\">that happens, too</a>). Along with my team \u2013 Nick Van Mead, deputy editor, Tash Reith-Banks, production editor and Claire Burke, commissioning and community editor \u2013 we have now run live weeks in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/series/guardian-cities-mumbai\">Mumbai</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/series/mexico-city-live\">Mexico City</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/series/guardian-lagos-week\">Lagos</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/series/guardian-moscow-week\">Moscow</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/series/guardian-atlanta-week\">Atlanta</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/series/sao-paulo-live\">S\u00e3o Paulo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/series/guardian-jakarta-live\">Jakarta</a>, where I found myself on the waterfront with Sofian and realised that she, too, was doing urban journalism.</p> <p>Now, I see it everywhere I look. In five years, cities have become big business: universities offer urban studies degrees, multinational corporations such as Siemens and Google sell \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/24/google-toronto-smart-city-sidewalk-project-alphabet-redevelopment\">smart city</a>\u201d technology to punch-drunk mayors, and there are dozens of \u201curban\u201d websites, from <a href=\"https://www.citymetric.com/\">Citymetric</a> to <a href=\"http://archive.citiscope.org/\">Citiscope</a> to the terrific US site <a href=\"https://www.citylab.com/\">Citylab</a> (as Atlantic Cities was renamed), edited by my former Guardian colleague Nicole Flatow.</p> <p>Guardian Cities itself now regularly attracts more than 5m page views each month.

      "bodyText": "My favourite Jakartan is Evi Mariani Sofian. It\u2019s not just because she knows the city\u2019s spiciest fish restaurants, cheerfully brings her seven-year-old son along on her assignments for the Jakarta Post, where she is managing editor, and relishes a bit of good-natured ribbing at the expense of naive journalists visiting from London. Rather, at the risk of sounding grandiose, one hot day when Sofian took me to the city\u2019s waterfront she showed me a new kind of journalism. Thousands of residents of Jakarta had been living for decades on the waterfront, in what the authorities call slums. Certainly, they live in homes built with their own hands, denied access to municipal services such as electricity and running water, and supporting themselves informally, through fishing, kiosks and services such as cutting hair. They were told the bulldozers weren\u2019t coming \u2013 but one night they did anyway, crushing the neighbourhood into a field of grey rubble. Grimly Sofian led me across a landscape that in devastation, though not of course in body count, rivalled the scenes then playing out in Syria. She introduced me to the men and women who\u2019d lived here their whole lives, and whose world had been destroyed overnight because hotel developers wanted to build a chain of islands that would look from space like a giant mythical eagle. Some of the residents had rebuilt new shacks, on the same spot, using the very rubble of their bulldozed homes \u2013 an almost crazed but entirely human determination that floors me as much today as it did then. To Sofian, it was Jakarta\u2019s most important story: about who has the right to the city. But nobody had died, it wasn\u2019t a campaign issue, and in many other ways it wasn\u2019t the kind of story we might have told before Guardian Cities launched in 2014. The statistic you always heard back then was that 50% of the world now lived in cities, and by deciding to start a Cities desk the Guardian was jumping smartly on the opportunity to explore that other great 21st-century phenomenon, after the digital revolution: urbanisation. People were moving to cities in their billions, and most of the new growth was happening without a plan. The idea was for Cities to offer something different editorially from the political horse races and procession of fatalities that typically characterises the \u201cnews agenda\u201d, but it wasn\u2019t clear how. Fiery opinions? In-depth policy? Wonkish dissections of the minutiae of transportation planning? (Some readers still get annoyed that we don\u2019t do more of that.) The Atlantic magazine had started Atlantic Cities in 2011 but otherwise there wasn\u2019t really such a thing as \u201curban journalism\u201d. I fancied myself a global journalist, and had broken several stories on international issues \u2013 such as the North Korean regime spokesperson who had tried to start a Glastonbury-style pop music festival in Pyongyang before defecting to Surrey, of all places, where I tracked him down in his new home above a Carphone Warehouse; or my first major scoop, when the members of an Ethiopian circus troupe revealed to me sexual abuse by their leader, Marc Lachance, who led me, my mentor Marina Jimenez and Canadian police on a trail that ended in the Andes with his suicide. My only real qualification for a job on the Cities desk, however, was that I\u2019d lived and worked in four of them. Before London I\u2019d spent three years in Tokyo at the International New York Times tie-up with the Asahi Shimbun, and before that I ran a lifestyle magazine in Montreal and then Toronto with the LA-based artist Alex DeJong. (The magazine was called Trucker, and it borrowed Vice\u2019s business model \u2013 parties and American Apparel ads \u2013 without the seedier edge, an omission that I posit to explain why I\u2019m not living in a \u00a320m villa in Santa Monica.) Luckily, Mike Herd, the founding Cities editor, was a firm believer that not being an expert in urbanism was an asset for telling stories about cities. Mike didn\u2019t want Cities to be a site for talking heads, or for politics, or for transport minutiae. He decided Cities would be, in his words, \u201clike the community wing of the foreign desk\u201d, and his biggest idea was the \u201clive week\u201d: our team would decamp for a week to a global megacity, but not to report on a city\u2019s issues for an audience back in London. Instead, we\u2019d give a platform to locals, to tell their own stories in their own words to their own community. It was, and remains, a phenomenally successful idea that I have doubled down on since becoming Cities editor. It is the heart of what \u201curban journalism\u201d has become at the Guardian: reported feature journalism, for global audiences, tackling the big issues of our time, from inequality to gentrification to how we move and live and work, without needing the justification of elections or death (although sometimes that happens, too). Along with my team \u2013 Nick Van Mead, deputy editor, Tash Reith-Banks, production editor and Claire Burke, commissioning and community editor \u2013 we have now run live weeks in Mumbai, Mexico City, Lagos, Moscow, Atlanta, S\u00e3o Paulo and Jakarta, where I found myself on the waterfront with Sofian and realised that she, too, was doing urban journalism. Now, I see it everywhere I look. In five years, cities have become big business: universities offer urban studies degrees, multinational corporations such as Siemens and Google sell \u201csmart city\u201d technology to punch-drunk mayors, and there are dozens of \u201curban\u201d websites, from Citymetric to Citiscope to the terrific US site Citylab (as Atlantic Cities was renamed), edited by my former Guardian colleague Nicole Flatow. Guardian Cities itself now regularly attracts more than 5m page views each month. We are expanding into film and podcasts this autumn. I\u2019m even seeing a new kind of urban crossover journalist, brilliant architecture and design critics such as the Guardian\u2019s Oliver Wainwright, the Observer\u2019s Rowan Moore or the New York Times\u2019s Michael Kimmelman who have branched out into telling gripping stories about cities and people, not just buildings. Inside the Guardian, Cities has found a home alongside the foreign desk, as well as environment, science, health and technology, supporting the correspondents and a growing global stable of freelance journalists (send us your pitch!) to break news outside the standard news cycle. How air pollution is choking us. The insidious creep of privately owned public space. Why developers are building segregated playgrounds (hint: so rich and poor kids don\u2019t mix). Where else but Guardian Cities could I have pursued my obsession with concrete? Above all, we\u2019ve been able to tell stories of people banding together to make their cities better when everyone above them is against them. Everywhere we\u2019ve been, I\u2019ve seen it: in Seoul, where the 10,000 small manufacturers who made South Korea into a powerhouse are fighting to save their unique economy; in Mexico City, at the community centre that declared a violence-free zone (and threw us a terrific neighbourhood block party); at the Juhu Beach shelter for street kids without parents in Mumbai; or at the jaw-dropping 8,000-strong tent city of S\u00e3o Paulo, where the activist and presidential candidate Guilherme Boulos told me: \u201cBrazil\u2019s homeless have organised.

As host next year, Trump could invite Putin even if others don\u2019t want to. Trump also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/26/trump-2020-g7-summit-national-doral-miami-resort\">said</a> that he wants to host the G7 at one of his resort properties, another opportunity to enrich himself at the expense of the taxpayer and violate the emoluments clause of the constitution. And it\u2019s scary to try to imagine what kind of policy agenda Trump would set \u2013 and especially terrifying envisioning Trump attempting to run the meetings.</p> <p>And let\u2019s be honest, no one wants this to happen next year. Trump doesn\u2019t <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/france-tries-to-orchestrate-a-no-drama-g-7-summit-but-trump-is-the-x-factor/2019/08/22/342ab388-c4f6-11e9-b72f-b31dfaa77212_story.html\">want</a> to go to these summits.

Of course, the United States won\u2019t retreat from the world while Trump is president, and all these leaders will continue to deal with Trump. This just isn\u2019t a productive setting now, and the good that is achieved on certain issues at the G7 can be achieved through other means. And if it seems fanciful to imagine Trump cancelling the meeting, just remember that he canceled a trip to Denmark because they wouldn\u2019t sell him Greenland.</p> <p>Coordination among the world\u2019s democracies is vital to addressing any of the grave challenges we face in the 21st century, and the G7 should get back to business when Trump is gone. But right now, it\u2019s not working. And maybe cancelling the summit one year will serve as a powerful reminder of the importance of the values that these democracies are supposed to stand for, and how necessary the G7 is when it lives up to its mission.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Michael H Fuchs is a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, and a former deputy assistant secretary of state for east Asian and Pacific affairs.

As host next year, Trump could invite Putin even if others don\u2019t want to. Trump also said that he wants to host the G7 at one of his resort properties, another opportunity to enrich himself at the expense of the taxpayer and violate the emoluments clause of the constitution. And it\u2019s scary to try to imagine what kind of policy agenda Trump would set \u2013 and especially terrifying envisioning Trump attempting to run the meetings. And let\u2019s be honest, no one wants this to happen next year. Trump doesn\u2019t want to go to these summits. Other G7 leaders don\u2019t want to attend. And we can all avoid the embarrassing spectacles and stark reminders that today, not even the world\u2019s oldest democracies are united in shared values. Canceling the next summit is not some ridiculous recommendation \u2013 it is a way to cope with the current realities and preserve a semblance of American credibility abroad. Of course, the United States won\u2019t retreat from the world while Trump is president, and all these leaders will continue to deal with Trump. This just isn\u2019t a productive setting now, and the good that is achieved on certain issues at the G7 can be achieved through other means. And if it seems fanciful to imagine Trump cancelling the meeting, just remember that he canceled a trip to Denmark because they wouldn\u2019t sell him Greenland. Coordination among the world\u2019s democracies is vital to addressing any of the grave challenges we face in the 21st century, and the G7 should get back to business when Trump is gone. But right now, it\u2019s not working. And maybe cancelling the summit one year will serve as a powerful reminder of the importance of the values that these democracies are supposed to stand for, and how necessary the G7 is when it lives up to its mission.

Initial estimates indicate 600 hectares of rainforest have been destroyed in the north-eastern region of Ben\u00ed, where the fires now threaten indigenous populations. \u201cThis is the biggest ever catastrophe for biodiversity in Bolivia,\u201d said Fernando Vargas, an indigenous leader in the Isiboro S\u00e9cure Indigenous territory and national park, known as Tipnis by its Spanish acronym. \u201cBut this is not a natural disaster but a manmade one,\u201d he told the Guardian. Bolivia\u2019s president, Evo Morales, had previously rejected offers of international help to battle the fires, but on Sunday he announced that he would interrupt his re-election campaign for a week to help coordinate foreign aid efforts. \u201cAny cooperation is welcome, whether it comes from international organisations, celebrities or from the presidents who offered to help,\u201d Morales said in Cochabamba, where he had been campaigning for a fourth term in office. The leading opposition candidate, Carlos Mesa, also suspended his election campaign in response to the national crisis. Morales said he had been called by global leaders, including the presidents of Paraguay, Chile and Spain, as the G7 group of the world\u2019s richest nations announced an aid package to fight Amazon fires. Firefighters from Chile and Argentina as well as France, Spain and Russia were deployed to help fight the flames, according to local media reports. However protesters and the political opposition say Morales\u2019 government needs to declare a state of emergency in the zone in order to allow foreign help in. More than 2,700 fires had been registered by Bolivia\u2019s early warning fire detection agency on Monday, in a swath of flames across the country, from the Amazon north-east to the south-eastern Chaco biome. \u201cIt\u2019s not a coincidence that less than a month ago the president declared a law which permitted slash and burn farming practices,\u201d said Adriana Rico, a Bolivian biologist. Known in Bolivia as chaqueo, slash-and-burn is often practiced by migrant small farmers as a cheap and easy way to clear land, she added. Blazes haves destroyed part of the Chiquitano forest, the Amazon and Bolivia\u2019s Pantanal region which it shares with Brazil and Paraguay. \u201cIt\u2019s very sad for we indigenous peoples, we\u2019ve lost our means of survival,\u201d said Adolfo Ch\u00e1vez, the former president of the Bolivian indigenous confederation CIDOB. He said Morales had turned his back on indigenous peoples by allowing the destruction of their habitat for the advance of agribusiness. Last week, the pan-Amazon indigenous organisation COICA accused Morales, and his Brazilian counterpart, Jair Bolsonaro, of \u201cgutting every environmental and social strategy to strengthen environmental governance of the Amazon\u201d. It declared the two governments as not welcome in the Amazon and held them personally accountable for the \u201ccultural and environmental genocide\u201d in the world\u2019s largest wilderness. \u201cThis month\u2019s devastating fires are the all-too-predictable consequence of the Morales government\u2019s decree authorising new land claims on cleared land\u201d, said Carwil Bjork-James, an anthropology professor at Vanderbilt University. \u2022 This article was amended on 29 August 2019 to correct the conversion of 1m hectares into acres.",

Dinner is a more sophisticated menu, featuring razor clams, grilled octopus, tuna steaks and other fish. We ate there for a treat one night \u2013 a huge slab of cod for me, and two giant shrimps on rice for my partner.</p> <p>There\u2019s a cheaper dinner option a five-minute walk along the beach. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/acasadopisao.pt/\" title=\"\">Casa do Pisao</a> is a small family-run restaurant with a simple menu \u2013 we ordered rice with prawns and clams for \u20ac7.50, which was delicious and exactly what we wanted on a windswept beach.

Or so I thought. My partner was happy reading a book by the pool and, as predicted, my son was reluctant to leave his gang of new friends; and so it was just me who joined a few other guests for a lesson. The waves on the nearby beaches were too strong for our group of novices so our instructor, Nuno, drove us up to Peniche, telling us how he had left a good job working for a construction company to teach surfing and \u201cfound his tribe\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"03b3bc8002c258f7aeea8701f6309d5feccadc53\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/03b3bc8002c258f7aeea8701f6309d5feccadc53/0_52_1500_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Surf lessons on Santa Cruz\u2019s sandy beach\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Surf lessons on Santa Cruz\u2019s sandy beach</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Once we were on the beach, Nuno explained how to find our centre of balance on the board, which made perfect sense when I was practising on a stationary board on the sand. In the water, the theory washed away. I couldn\u2019t stay on the board while lying down let alone standing up; nonetheless, an hour and a half of paddling into the waves, waiting for the right one and attempting to ride back into shore without falling off was both exhilarating and calming as my mind emptied of all thoughts other than what the sea was doing and how I should respond to it.</p> <p>Back at the hotel we sat on the terrace looking out at the hazy expanse of sand. \u201cSanta Cruz is my paradise!\u201d said Godinho when we met a couple of days later. \u201cIt was where I holidayed growing up.\u201d I wonder if she ever imagined the role she would be playing in its transformation when she played on the beach as a child. <br><br> \u2022 <em>Accommodation was provided by <a href=\"https://www.i-escape.com/noah-surf-house\" title=\"\">i-escape.com</a>, which has apartments for three at Noah from \u00a3148</em><em>B&amp;B.

Before the Surf House came the Noah Beach House restaurant (more distressed wood and artfully arranged fishing paraphernalia and driftwood), which offers surprisingly reasonable lunches (\u20ac3.50 sandwiches and a substantial burger for \u20ac8.90) in a mesmerising setting on the sand. Dinner is a more sophisticated menu, featuring razor clams, grilled octopus, tuna steaks and other fish. We ate there for a treat one night \u2013 a huge slab of cod for me, and two giant shrimps on rice for my partner. There\u2019s a cheaper dinner option a five-minute walk along the beach. Casa do Pisao is a small family-run restaurant with a simple menu \u2013 we ordered rice with prawns and clams for \u20ac7.50, which was delicious and exactly what we wanted on a windswept beach. It was chilly and windy when we were there, so we sat inside and watched the steel-blue sea. A few kilometres north at the Santa Rita car park there\u2019s another no-frills option \u2013 Gr\u00e3o d\u2019Areia overlooking the long, sandy expanse of Praia de Santa Rita Norte, though it was sadly shut on the afternoon we pitched up in search of ice-cream after a windswept walk on the deserted beach. You can\u2019t come to Noah and not surf. Or so I thought. My partner was happy reading a book by the pool and, as predicted, my son was reluctant to leave his gang of new friends; and so it was just me who joined a few other guests for a lesson. The waves on the nearby beaches were too strong for our group of novices so our instructor, Nuno, drove us up to Peniche, telling us how he had left a good job working for a construction company to teach surfing and \u201cfound his tribe\u201d. Once we were on the beach, Nuno explained how to find our centre of balance on the board, which made perfect sense when I was practising on a stationary board on the sand. In the water, the theory washed away. I couldn\u2019t stay on the board while lying down let alone standing up; nonetheless, an hour and a half of paddling into the waves, waiting for the right one and attempting to ride back into shore without falling off was both exhilarating and calming as my mind emptied of all thoughts other than what the sea was doing and how I should respond to it. Back at the hotel we sat on the terrace looking out at the hazy expanse of sand. \u201cSanta Cruz is my paradise!\u201d said Godinho when we met a couple of days later. \u201cIt was where I holidayed growing up.\u201d I wonder if she ever imagined the role she would be playing in its transformation when she played on the beach as a child. \u2022 Accommodation was provided by i-escape.com, which has apartments for three at Noah from \u00a3148B&amp;B. Bungalows sleeping three-four also available from \u00a3148 as well as dorm beds from \u00a350 B&amp;B. Car hire was provided by Centro de Portugal, Flights were provided by TAP, from \u00a383 return including all taxes and surcharges, flytap.com Looking for a holiday with a difference?

      "bodyText": "An Aboriginal man has been awarded $400,000 in damages for a \u201ccowardly and brutal attack\u201d by counter-terrorism police officers who used unreasonable force to arrest him during a dawn raid in Melbourne. Eathan Cruse was 19 years old on 18 April 2015, when masked, armed and armoured officers from the joint counter-terrorism team entered his parents\u2019 house and then assaulted him while he was in handcuffs. It was one of six dawn raids conducted that morning in an investigation into a reported plot to kill police and civilians on Anzac Day. Eades was released without charge and another man was later convicted and sentenced to 14 years in jail. The supreme court judge Melinda Richards said the conduct of the police officers involved in the arrest was \u201ca shocking departure from the standards set for police officers by parliament and expected of them by the community\u201d. Cruse told the court he had been restrained with cable ties while lying on the floor of the hallway, hit several times to the side of the head, then moved to the kitchen where he was thrown against the fridge, pushed on to the floor and struck a number of times on the head, neck and upper body. While he was lying on the floor, he said, police told him there was \u201cmore to come\u201d. Richards, who handed down a decision in the case on Tuesday after a three-day trial last month, said she believed Cruse\u2019s account of events. \u201cI have concluded that the arrest was not lawful,\u201d she said. Richards referred the case to the Independent Broad-based Anti-Corruption Commission. Cruse\u2019s account was supported by evidence from his father, who said he could not see everything happening in the kitchen from where he was held but: \u201cI\u2019ve heard it. I know what a beating sounds like.\u201d Richards found that police involved had given \u201cfalse denials\u201d that were accepted by the Victorian government in its decision to fight Cruse\u2019s claim for damages. \u201cOne or more police officers, armed and armoured, their faces masked, struck Mr Curse repeatedly on to his head, neck and upper body while he was lying, handcuffed and defenceless, on his parents\u2019 kitchen floor,\u201d Richards said. \u201cMr Cruse feared he might die then and there.\u201d She also found that police had wrongly suggested that Cruse resisted arrest, unreasonably suggested they were concerned he had a knife, and did not have reasonable grounds to suspect him of involvement in the terrorist plot. \u201cAt no stage has the state acknowledged what occurred or expressed regret or contrition for the conduct of its police officers,\u201d Richards said. Cruse has suffered major depression and untreated post-traumatic stress disorder since the attack. Richards said the damages awarded were \u201cnot sufficient to bring home to the state of Victoria and Victoria police the enormity of the abuse of power that occurred here\u201d but they would help Cruse obtain medical treatment. The chief executive of the Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service, Nerita Waight, said Cruse had attempted to deal with the matter through Victoria police\u2019s official complaints system before eventually taking it to court. A Robinson Gill Lawyers principal lawyer, Jeremy King, said the judgment addressed systemic police misconduct. \u201cThe police accountability system unilaterally failed Eathan,\u201d King said. \u201cPeople should not have to take their matters to the supreme court to get justice for police misconduct.\u201d The Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission is conducting an inquiry into Victoria police\u2019s handling of complaints of serious misconduct made by Aboriginal people.

All you need is some pocket money and a smartphone. But what is fascinating about this new subculture is that it is not taking place in crowded moshpits or twilit parks, but quietly in bedrooms. \u201cI don\u2019t go out much,\u201d says Provenzano. \u201cMy friends come here or we go to their houses \u2026 but we don\u2019t really <em>go</em> places.\u201d</p> <p>Aiman Sheeraz, a 17-year-old from Manchester, says: \u201cMy favourite skill is blending.

She asked, \u2018Are you sure this is for Halloween?'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>After her mum died two and a half years ago, Sheeraz started doing makeovers on her family and friends, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/aimansheeraz/?hl=en\" title=\"\">posting the results online</a>. \u201cI thought, why not get my talent out there?\u201d At first, Sheeraz did the makeup thing to honour her mum. But soon it took on a life of its own. \u201cIt was never what I wanted to do full-time,\u201d says Sheeraz, who is studying for an apprenticeship in accountancy. \u201cIt\u2019s more something to do on her behalf and make her happy. But now I really enjoy it myself. I guess I\u2019m doing it for her in a way.\u201d</p> <p>As with any subculture, there are different tribes. Fans tend to divide into two camps: the first are lovers of the haute-glam look popularised by the Kardashian-Jenners and makeup artists such as <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/makeupbymario/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Mario Dedivanovic</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/kevynaucoin/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Kevyn Aucoin</a>. Sheeraz falls into this category, describing her style as \u201cAsian glam\u201d: \u201ca very glowy base, full coverage, bright lips and eyes, but also something that you can wear to weddings and events \u2013 it won\u2019t just look nice in pictures.\u201d Meanwhile, creative makeup fans prefer art-driven, colourful looks. \u201cWith creative makeup there aren\u2019t many rules, you can do what you want,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/makeupby_niamhx/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Niamh Dunne</a>, a 19-year-old supermarket worker from Corby, Northamptonshire. Dunne takes inspiration from films or TV shows such as Stranger Things. After the Lion King reboot came out, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B0jJP0lpEm4/\" title=\"\">she freehand-painted</a> the amber and ochre colours of an African sunset on her chest. It took three hours.</p> <p>Critics may say that young people shouldn\u2019t be messing around with blusher \u2013 they should be focusing on their careers. But this is wildly missing the mark: beauty is a very lucrative career choice. Just ask Kylie Jenner, who built a billion-dollar fortune off the back of her cosmetics company (although sales <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/07/28/kylie-jenners-cosmetics-sales-fall-14-percent-as-gloss-dims/\" title=\"\">are rumoured to be down</a>).

They all bat those concerns away. \u201cMost of the time I\u2019m actually barefaced,\u201d Sheeraz says. \u201cWhen I go to work, I don\u2019t wear it, because I\u2019d rather spend the time sleeping.\u201d Dunne agrees: \u201cWith teenage girls, there is so much pressure on the way you look \u2013 getting surgery and lip fillers and all of that stuff,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think it should be like that. I don\u2019t wear it because I think I need it. I wear it because I enjoy doing it.\u201d</p> <p>It is not just girls who are perfecting makeup techniques you\u2019ve never heard of, such as <a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/a19137299/halo-brows-halo-eyebrow-trend/\" title=\"\">halo brows</a> or <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tanyachen/also-who-is-licking-their-lollipops-like-this\" title=\"\">lollipop lips</a>. Brands such as Milk Makeup and Fluide have created genderless cosmetics ranges, while legacy players including Chanel and Givenchy have launched male lines. They are targeting consumers like 17-year-old Matt Tierney. \u201cI remember sneakily telling my mum I had a Halloween party to go to when I was 14, so we could go to Superdrug and buy some makeup. She asked, \u2018Are you sure this is for Halloween?\u2019\u201d He laughs. Through YouTube, Tierney built up the confidence to experiment with makeup. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t see people doing it online, I\u2019d never have gotten into it. I live in a little village in Northamptonshire. I\u2019ve never seen anyone walking around with a rainbow eye or in drag. You don\u2019t see that here.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"89fceccf51465c740cdae38e1508f4aeb6f21541\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89fceccf51465c740cdae38e1508f4aeb6f21541/0_102_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aiman Sheeraz at home in Manchester.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018This is what YouTube has taught me \u2013 to blend my life away!\u2019 Aiman Sheeraz at home in Manchester.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of course, marketing makeup to men doubles the amount of product brands can sell. And there is no doubt that consumerism is at the heart of this subculture \u2013 to an alarming extent. Provenzano takes me to her local Superdrug. \u201cIf I\u2019m in town, I\u2019ll come in to have a look,\u201d she says, fingering a yellow Revolution eyeshadow lovingly. (Provenzano favours affordable brands \u2013 although she has a few high-end eyeshadow palettes by the US brand Lime Crime \u2013 that aren\u2019t tested on animals.) Makeup influencers such as Jaclyn Hill have landed themselves in trouble with their young fanbases over the quality of their products \u2013 in one case, her lipstick was said to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-48745293\" title=\"\">contain</a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-48745293\" title=\"\"> metal shards</a>. Tierney bought the James Charles x Morphe palette after seeing it hyped online. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was that great, to be honest. Maybe everyone saying it was amazing was on his payroll.\u201d</p> <p>Regulators have started to step in. In the US, the Federal Trade Commission <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katienotopoulos/ftc-cracks-down-harder-on-celebrity-instagram-ads\" title=\"\">wrote</a> to <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/foia_requests/all_of_the_signed_letters.pdf\" title=\"\">high-profile influencers</a> to warn them against \u201cstealth shilling\u201d, where they fail to disclose they are being paid by brands. Earlier this year, the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jan/23/celebrity-social-media-influencers-pledge-to-change-way-they-post\" title=\"\">secured formal commitments</a> from celebrities to be more transparent about paid-for endorsements.</p> <p>Even then, young people may not be able to recognise when their favourite online makeup artists are pushing products because they are paid to advertise them. \u201cWhat we see in the research is that they don\u2019t really recognise the advertising in vlogs or on Instagram as advertising, as much as they do on TV,\u201d warns Steffi de Jans of Ghent University. She characterises most beauty vlogs as effectively advertising: the vloggers are either being paid by the brand directly, or receiving free products. And this isn\u2019t just a 30-second cereal advert in a commercial break. \u201cIt\u2019s hours and hours in a row of advertising messages, and they\u2019re really engaging with it.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/apr/05/its-genuine-you-know-why-the-online-influencer-industry-is-going-authentic\">\u2018It\u2019s genuine, you know?\u2019: why the online influencer industry is going \u2018authentic\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Subcultures have always been consumer-adjacent: you buy records, safety pins, miniskirts. But the act of consumerism isn\u2019t peripheral to this emerging beauty subculture \u2013 it\u2019s integral to it. This is consumerism <em>as</em> subculture. Sheeraz estimates she has spent about \u00a31,000 on products from brands including Anastasia Beverly Hills and Huda Beauty, whose palettes retail for \u00a340 to \u00a360. Can a community that is so predicated on consumer consumption truly be considered a subculture?</p> <p>Probably not, says Dr Rehan Hyder of the University of the West of England, explaining that it is better to think of these teenagers according to the concept of creative fandom, as coined by academic Henry Jenkins. \u201cFans aren\u2019t just consumers, but producers. They\u2019re not participating passively, but creating a community in which you share expertise, skills and collective intelligence.\u201d In the beauty world, they use makeup to establish themselves as persons of influence and skill \u2013 like Tierney, who aims to achieve 100k followers. \u201cThat would be a massive milestone,\u201d he says.</p> <p>As teenage pursuits go, however, it is hard to think of a more clean-living way for young people to be spending their time \u2013 a bottle of shoplifted vodka being passed around a park this is not. \u201cI\u2019m not really a going-out person,\u201d says Dunne. \u201cYou just get hungover and can\u2019t be productive the next day.\u201d Tierney thinks that makeup gives young people something to do. \u201cIt\u2019s quite wholesome,\u201d he laughs. \u201cPeople who have no lives, sitting in their room with a ring light on, blending makeup on their eyes!\u201d (He recently got one of these lights himself.)</p> <p>Ring lights, contour kits, an arsenal of brushes to make Picasso blush: for teenagers today, makeup isn\u2019t a superficial hobby, but a way of expressing their creativity, hopes and dreams. Back in her bedroom, Provenzano does my makeup while telling me about her ambitions for the future \u2013 she aspires to be a makeup artist for fashion shows. \u201cGoing to London,\u201d she says dreamily, eyeshadow brush in hand. \u201cThe fashion weeks \u2013 Milan, London, Paris. Obviously I can\u2019t stay in Kettering and do runways, because it\u2019s so small.\u201d And as she applies my eyeshadow with precision of a surgeon performing keyhole surgery, I close my eyes and think: \u201cYou\u2019ll get there.\u201d</p>",

Sheeraz falls into this category, describing her style as \u201cAsian glam\u201d: \u201ca very glowy base, full coverage, bright lips and eyes, but also something that you can wear to weddings and events \u2013 it won\u2019t just look nice in pictures.\u201d Meanwhile, creative makeup fans prefer art-driven, colourful looks. \u201cWith creative makeup there aren\u2019t many rules, you can do what you want,\u201d says Niamh Dunne, a 19-year-old supermarket worker from Corby, Northamptonshire. Dunne takes inspiration from films or TV shows such as Stranger Things. After the Lion King reboot came out, she freehand-painted the amber and ochre colours of an African sunset on her chest. It took three hours. Critics may say that young people shouldn\u2019t be messing around with blusher \u2013 they should be focusing on their careers. But this is wildly missing the mark: beauty is a very lucrative career choice. Just ask Kylie Jenner, who built a billion-dollar fortune off the back of her cosmetics company (although sales are rumoured to be down). Of the 80 women on Forbes\u2019s so-called \u201cself-made women\u201d rich list this year, 10 are from the makeup and skincare industries. Sheeraz wants to become like her idol, the beauty mogul Huda Kattan. \u201cBeing a woman of colour and getting to where she is from being an average person is really inspirational to me.\u201d I wonder if any of the teens think it may be damaging to be so focused on their appearance. They all bat those concerns away. \u201cMost of the time I\u2019m actually barefaced,\u201d Sheeraz says. \u201cWhen I go to work, I don\u2019t wear it, because I\u2019d rather spend the time sleeping.\u201d Dunne agrees: \u201cWith teenage girls, there is so much pressure on the way you look \u2013 getting surgery and lip fillers and all of that stuff,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think it should be like that. I don\u2019t wear it because I think I need it. I wear it because I enjoy doing it.\u201d It is not just girls who are perfecting makeup techniques you\u2019ve never heard of, such as halo brows or lollipop lips. Brands such as Milk Makeup and Fluide have created genderless cosmetics ranges, while legacy players including Chanel and Givenchy have launched male lines. They are targeting consumers like 17-year-old Matt Tierney. \u201cI remember sneakily telling my mum I had a Halloween party to go to when I was 14, so we could go to Superdrug and buy some makeup. She asked, \u2018Are you sure this is for Halloween?\u2019\u201d He laughs. Through YouTube, Tierney built up the confidence to experiment with makeup. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t see people doing it online, I\u2019d never have gotten into it. I live in a little village in Northamptonshire. I\u2019ve never seen anyone walking around with a rainbow eye or in drag. You don\u2019t see that here.\u201d Of course, marketing makeup to men doubles the amount of product brands can sell. And there is no doubt that consumerism is at the heart of this subculture \u2013 to an alarming extent. Provenzano takes me to her local Superdrug. \u201cIf I\u2019m in town, I\u2019ll come in to have a look,\u201d she says, fingering a yellow Revolution eyeshadow lovingly. (Provenzano favours affordable brands \u2013 although she has a few high-end eyeshadow palettes by the US brand Lime Crime \u2013 that aren\u2019t tested on animals.) Makeup influencers such as Jaclyn Hill have landed themselves in trouble with their young fanbases over the quality of their products \u2013 in one case, her lipstick was said to contain metal shards. Tierney bought the James Charles x Morphe palette after seeing it hyped online. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was that great, to be honest. Maybe everyone saying it was amazing was on his payroll.\u201d Regulators have started to step in. In the US, the Federal Trade Commission wrote to high-profile influencers to warn them against \u201cstealth shilling\u201d, where they fail to disclose they are being paid by brands. Earlier this year, the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority secured formal commitments from celebrities to be more transparent about paid-for endorsements. Even then, young people may not be able to recognise when their favourite online makeup artists are pushing products because they are paid to advertise them. \u201cWhat we see in the research is that they don\u2019t really recognise the advertising in vlogs or on Instagram as advertising, as much as they do on TV,\u201d warns Steffi de Jans of Ghent University. She characterises most beauty vlogs as effectively advertising: the vloggers are either being paid by the brand directly, or receiving free products. And this isn\u2019t just a 30-second cereal advert in a commercial break. \u201cIt\u2019s hours and hours in a row of advertising messages, and they\u2019re really engaging with it.\u201d Subcultures have always been consumer-adjacent: you buy records, safety pins, miniskirts. But the act of consumerism isn\u2019t peripheral to this emerging beauty subculture \u2013 it\u2019s integral to it. This is consumerism as subculture. Sheeraz estimates she has spent about \u00a31,000 on products from brands including Anastasia Beverly Hills and Huda Beauty, whose palettes retail for \u00a340 to \u00a360. Can a community that is so predicated on consumer consumption truly be considered a subculture? Probably not, says Dr Rehan Hyder of the University of the West of England, explaining that it is better to think of these teenagers according to the concept of creative fandom, as coined by academic Henry Jenkins. \u201cFans aren\u2019t just consumers, but producers. They\u2019re not participating passively, but creating a community in which you share expertise, skills and collective intelligence.\u201d In the beauty world, they use makeup to establish themselves as persons of influence and skill \u2013 like Tierney, who aims to achieve 100k followers. \u201cThat would be a massive milestone,\u201d he says. As teenage pursuits go, however, it is hard to think of a more clean-living way for young people to be spending their time \u2013 a bottle of shoplifted vodka being passed around a park this is not. \u201cI\u2019m not really a going-out person,\u201d says Dunne. \u201cYou just get hungover and can\u2019t be productive the next day.\u201d Tierney thinks that makeup gives young people something to do. \u201cIt\u2019s quite wholesome,\u201d he laughs. \u201cPeople who have no lives, sitting in their room with a ring light on, blending makeup on their eyes!\u201d (He recently got one of these lights himself.) Ring lights, contour kits, an arsenal of brushes to make Picasso blush: for teenagers today, makeup isn\u2019t a superficial hobby, but a way of expressing their creativity, hopes and dreams. Back in her bedroom, Provenzano does my makeup while telling me about her ambitions for the future \u2013 she aspires to be a makeup artist for fashion shows. \u201cGoing to London,\u201d she says dreamily, eyeshadow brush in hand. \u201cThe fashion weeks \u2013 Milan, London, Paris. Obviously I can\u2019t stay in Kettering and do runways, because it\u2019s so small.\u201d And as she applies my eyeshadow with precision of a surgeon performing keyhole surgery, I close my eyes and think: \u201cYou\u2019ll get there.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Collapsible Breffni Holahan gives a searing performance as Essie in Margaret Perry\u2019s corrosive play about a woman\u2019s disintegration. Essie is trapped atop a stone plinth dusted in dirt. Gigantic spikes of rock splinter the air around her. Her feet dangle. Having lost her job and broken up with her girlfriend, she is in every way ungrounded. This is where Perry\u2019s play is rooted: in the queasy gap between her feet and the floor. KW At HighTide festival, Aldeburgh, 10-15 September. Read our four-star review All of Me This used to be a lighter, more hopeful kind of show about depression, Caroline Horton explains. But she became ill again, so now All of Me is unashamedly bleak. Her depression is interwoven with myth, switching abruptly from ancient narrative to everyday hopelessness. One moment, Horton is approaching the guardians of the underworld; the next, she\u2019s lying on the floor in unwashed clothes. Through layers of storytelling, song and looped sound we hear the overwhelming noise of despair \u2013 as well as its occasional absurdity. CL At the Yard, London, 10-28 September. Read our four-star review Hard to Be Soft: A Belfast Prayer Dancer and choreographer Oona Doherty\u2019s Hard to be Soft: A Belfast Prayer is about the toughness of her home-town; the carapace of swagger and sass, rage and resilience built up by men and women in a place where the conflict seems intractable and horizons are limited by constrictions of class and religion. AW At the Southbank Centre, London, on 11 October. Read our five-star review Jonny and the Baptists \u2018As of right now, we\u2019re no longer political.\u201d That\u2019s the conceit of this new show from Jonny and the Baptists, AKA musical comics Jonny Donahoe and Paddy Gervers. They have made their name setting-up (and sending up) leftwing causes to Gervers\u2019 emphatic guitar-playing and Donahoe\u2019s big bluesy voice \u2013 and where has it got them? Or any of us? So instead, they are making a show about love. That\u2019s the pitch, although you can\u2019t take it entirely seriously after an opener that loudly choruses \u201cyou\u2019re either against capitalism or for the end of the world.\u201d BL At Tom Thumb theatre, Margate, on 12 September. Then touring until 18 December. Read our four-star review Since U Been Gone The ache of lost time is contained in this delicate monologue grappling with grief and gender. With simple stagecraft and raw storytelling, Teddy Lamb\u2019s Since U Been Gone is about the people who make us, and how they continue to do so long after they\u2019re gone. However tough its subject matter, Since U Been Gone is buoyant, as theatre becomes a place of exploration, distraction and safety. Lamb bursts with charisma and generosity. KW At HighTide festival, Aldeburgh, on 19 September and at Camden People\u2019s theatre, London, 19-20 November. Read our four-star review Lucy McCormick: Post Popular Utterly indelicate and completely unpredictable, Post Popular is a wild ride. Lucy McCormick\u2019s ludicrous performance-lecture-cum-cabaret-cum-rage-room is built with so many layers of irony and mockery that its core would be rotten by the time you dug down to it. If only more history lessons were like this. Within minutes she\u2019s intimately licking one of her backing dancers. But far more than a gratuitous joke, this singalong search for a hero is a sabre-toothed comedy about women\u2019s place in the limelight. KW At Soho theatre, London, 3-14 December. Read our four-star review Baby Reindeer If you followed Richard Gadd\u2019s career up to his Edinburgh comedy award-winning Monkey See Monkey Do three years ago, you might think he\u2019d had his lifetime\u2019s fill of trauma and that happily, it had culminated in that cathartic triumph. Among its startling achievements, Baby Reindeer leaves that notion in tatters. Gadd\u2019s solo theatre debut recounts his horrifying experiences with a stalker. He took pity on and flirted with Martha when she propped up the bar where he worked, six years ago. If that mistake didn\u2019t quite prove fatal, it was the next worst thing. BL At the Bush theatre, London, 9 October-9 November. Read our four-star review Sexy Lamp The words from Seth MacFarlane\u2019s opening number at the 2013 Oscars \u2013 in which the host name-checked the nude scenes of female actors in the audience \u2013 are heard at the start of Katie Arnstein\u2019s smart solo show. That sort of routine wouldn\u2019t happen now, we might think, but by the end of Arnstein\u2019s show it is uncomfortably clear how much the #MeToo momentum must be maintained. Sexy Lamp is full of sharp insights into the ways actors are exploited \u2013 groomed, even \u2013 by the machinations of an entire industry. CW At Upstairs at the Western, Leicester, 12-13 September. Read our four-star review Total Immediate Collective Imminent Terrestrial Salvation And, lo, as it was foretold, Tim Crouch came to work with the National Theatre of Scotland. As it is written in the scriptures, he arrived empty-handed, with neither set nor props, to present a show about a messianic cult leader at the end of days. As the prophets set down, he required the audience to gather, congregation-like, in a big circle, as if we too were readying ourselves for the apocalypse. It was called Total Immediate Collective Imminent Terrestrial Salvation and we saw that it was good. MF At the Royal Court, London, 3\u201321 September. Then touring. Read our four-star review Ahir Shah: Dots Ahir Shah has long joked about the contrast between what he looks like and how he sounds: his brown skin and posh accent. Now a new faultline has appeared between his substance and style, as the ardent polemicist of his early work gives way to a more conflicted thinker. But the emphatic tones remain. Dots describes the collapse of the certainties Shah felt in his youth, in the voice of a man who thinks he is right about everything. BL At Soho theatre, London, 16-28 September. Read our four-star review Life Is No Laughing Matter Demi Nandhra\u2019s solo show focuses on her experience of depression and the inadequate care she was offered when she sought help. One doctor prescribes exercise and bananas; another suggests that Nandhra might feel better if she got married. The internet, meanwhile, tells her that getting a dog could be the answer. Nandhra sends up each of these suggestions in turn, star-jumping while stuffing bananas into her mouth or chasing her gleefully disobedient pup around the stage. CL At Arena theatre, Wolverhampton, on 14 October. At Camden People\u2019s theatre, London, 21-22 November. Read our four-star review Pops Ties of love and betrayal bind the father and daughter in Pops. But in Charlotte Josephine\u2019s play, the real drama lives and breathes in what\u2019s not said. Josephine and director Ali Pidsley are unafraid of silence, painting as much with pauses as with words. These wordless sequences are bold, lasting for longer than is comfortable. And when the characters do speak, their repeated banalities \u2013 \u201chi love\u201d, \u201csit down\u201d \u2013 break all the rules that writers are taught. Plays are not meant to look like this. CL At HighTide festival, Aldeburgh, 14-15 September. Read our four-star review Until the Flood Dael Orlandersmith\u2019s play both is and isn\u2019t about the 2014 shooting of black teenager Michael Brown by white police officer Darren Wilson. This event is the catalyst for Until the Flood, which digs into the aftermath of the shooting and unearths ugly truths about race in the United States. In front of a candle-filled, flickering memorial to Brown, each speaker is fully inhabited and dispassionately held up for inspection. With a single item of clothing and a subtle shifting of her limbs, Orlandersmith transforms into her characters one by one. CL At the Arcola theatre, London, 4-28 September. Read our four-star review Jordan Brookes: I\u2019ve Got Nothing \u2018In all sincerity \u2026\u201d says Jordan Brookes at the beginning of the heartfelt audience address that closes his Edinburgh Comedy award-winning show. But sincerity is a devalued currency in Brookes\u2019s shows, and he knows it. The point of I\u2019ve Got Nothing is that nothing he does can be trusted or taken for granted. He drills deep into the constituent parts of a comedy show, looking for cogs to disable or sprockets to twist into new, destabilising shapes. It\u2019s always gripping. You seldom know what he\u2019s up to, or what he\u2019ll do next. BL At Soho theatre, London, 2, 6 and 7 September, then 10-15 February.

Alabanza tries to reconcile themselves with this random (yet commonplace) act of violence, by taking control of the offending weapon.

      "body": "<p>Katie Arnstein tells a story of a day at drama school when a tutor told her to perform her graduation show in a bra \u201cbecause I\u2019m a blonde with a big chest\u201d. It is one of several experiences that informed Arnstein\u2019s solo show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/18/sexy-lamp-review-edinburgh-2019\">Sexy Lamp</a>, performed at the Edinburgh fringe this month. The title comes from writer Kelly Sue DeConnick\u2019s theory that, if you can replace a female character with a lamp and the story still basically works, maybe you need another draft.</p> <p>Arnstein wrote her play, which features shocking revelations about auditions and casting call notices, because she felt so galvanised by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/metoo-movement\">#MeToo </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/metoo-movement\">movement</a> that followed the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/us/harvey-weinstein-harassment-allegations.html\">numerous allegations of rape and sexual assault</a> levelled at Harvey Weinstein since 2017. (Allegations he continues to deny in the run-up to his trial in September.) \u201cI was inspired by the strength shown by people who have called out abuse in the acting industry,\u201d Arnstein says. \u201cThis play is my version of the #MeToo story, my journey of being an actor and the challenges I continue to face because of my gender.\u201d</p> <p>She is not alone in putting abuse on the stage. Several playwrights have taken on the Weinstein story directly, treating the allegations in imaginative and sometimes incendiary ways. Among the first was David Mamet, known for his preoccupation with power and its abuse, often refracted through lethally predatory masculinity in his plays. He <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jan/29/david-mamet-play-bitter-wheat-harvey-weinstein-john-malkovich\">announced in early 2019</a> that he was working on Bitter Wheat, a \u201cdark farce\u201d starring John Malkovich as a shamed movie mogul called Barney Fein, who has uncanny similarities to Weinstein.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d99569047ce4a4c377ff2fcd4834eae5ee7cc6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d99569047ce4a4c377ff2fcd4834eae5ee7cc6e/0_210_5760_3548/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shocking revelations \u2026 Katie Arnstein in Sexy Lamp.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"616\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shocking revelations \u2026 Katie Arnstein in Sexy Lamp.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jun/19/bitter-wheat-review-malkovich-and-mamets-monstrous-misfire\">Bitter Wheat landed with a thud this summer in London</a>. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/nov/20/steven-berkoff-interview-baddies-harvey-weinstein-play\">Steven Berkoff</a> beat Mamet to the first, no-holds-barred play enacting the story from the predator\u2019s perspective with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/feb/13/harvey-review-steven-berkoff-harvey-weinstein-playground-theatre-london\">Harvey</a>, a scrappy 45-minute monologue that was still being workshopped when it was performed in February at the Playground theatre in London. In a static performance, Berkoff sat in the centre of an almost bare stage wearing tracksuit bottoms and T-shirt. Delivering a monologue that was part-confession, part-justification of his acts, Berkoff\u2019s narcissistic, misogynistic character attempted to implicate the women who met him in hotel rooms. The monologue was interspersed with bilious summaries of abusive encounters, from hotel-room assaults to grim masturbatory episodes.</p> <p>The staging of Mamet and Berkoff\u2019s dramas raised questions of timing and sensitivity. Did we want to be inside the head of a sexual predator at a time when the unheard stories of women, and victims, were beginning to be dramatised?</p> <p>Other directors and playwrights mobilised plans of action to foreground women\u2019s perspectives. Vicky Featherstone, artistic director of the Royal Court, curated <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0b7pfcr/episodes/guide\">Snatches</a>, a series of monologues for BBC4 with an all-female lineup of writers, directors and actors. Among them was Compliance, a drama written by Abi Morgan about a young female actor meeting a senior producer in a hotel bedroom to \u201crun through a scene\u201d. Its lead was played by Romola Garai, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/09/actor-romola-garai-felt-violated-after-harvey-weinstein-encounter\">was among the first women to speak out about Weinstein</a>, describing an audition that took part in his hotel room at the Savoy when he opened the door to his room dressed in just a bathrobe. Garai, 18 at the time, reflected on how it left her feeling \u201cviolated\u201d but that such behaviour was accepted in an industry that was \u201cvery very very misogynistic\u201d.</p> <p>There were signs of a reckoning for silenced women from the past, too, the most prominent of which was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/aug/16/emilia-review-speculative-history-of-shakespeares-lover-brims-with-wit-and-rage\">Emilia</a>, co-produced by Nica Burns, in which Morgan Lloyd Malcolm dramatised the life of Emilia Bassano, a poet and contemporary of William Shakespeare who, Lloyd Malcolm argues, was the unacknowledged inspiration for his plays. Commissioned in 2016, it was written after the Weinstein case made headlines, says Burns. \u201cEmilia could not get published in her time because she was a woman. It\u2019s all about women wanting their voices to be heard.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"33fbe8169b5500fa00b4686cdf260f1a2c67e7cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33fbe8169b5500fa00b4686cdf260f1a2c67e7cf/0_113_4247_2548/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Unacknowledged inspiration \u2026 Emilia by Morgan Lloyd Malcolm.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Unacknowledged inspiration \u2026 Emilia by Morgan Lloyd Malcolm.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rose McGowan, who alleges she was raped by Weinstein, performed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jul/01/rose-mcgowan-edinburgh-harvey-weinstein-me-too\">a one-woman show</a> at Edinburgh this month, taking the audience \u201con a healing journey of discovery\u201d. More #MeToo plays by female writers are in the pipeline. Emily McLaughlin, head of new work at the National Theatre, speaks of an exceptional play in development by a writer \u201cwho has found a brilliant device to look at sexual abuse and harassment in the film industry\u201d.</p> <p>In the US, there has been an assortment of #MeToo-related dramas, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jan/13/pussy-grabber-plays-donald-trump-natasha-stoynoff\">The Pussy Grabber Plays</a>, inspired by the stories of women who had accused Donald Trump of sexual assault or harassment. Its co-creators, Kate Pines and Sharyn Rothstein, distilled their testimonies into drama. \u201cI felt very much that the women who had come forward over Trump were the precursors to the women who came forward over Weinstein,\u201d says Pines. \u201cThe stories about Trump had been largely ignored and relegated to a footnote of the elections.\u201d</p> <p>Natasha Stoynoff, a journalist whose story was dramatised in The Pussy Grabber Plays, thought it was important for her account to be preserved in a more complex way than she had seen it presented in news clips. \u201cKate and Sharyn wanted to go deeper into the women\u2019s stories \u2026 We\u2019d all become headshots flashed on a TV screen, like victims of a serial killer.\u201d She hopes it might serve as a comfort to women in similar situations \u2013 and help men, too. \u201cIf even one man walks out of the theatre more aware of his own actions regarding women and boundaries, that\u2019s progress,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4bd03f3051d0f1f89cbf419a1dba6e5c540df44e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4bd03f3051d0f1f89cbf419a1dba6e5c540df44e/1561_1489_1446_1807/800.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Weinstein was brought down because change was happening\u2019 \u2026 Vicky Featherstone.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Weinstein was brought down because change was happening\u2019 \u2026 Vicky Featherstone.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pines has reservations over Bitter Wheat. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in his perspective. The playwright <a href=\"http://secure.orchardproject.com/family/mathilde-dratwa\">Mathilde Dratwa</a> has written A Play About David Mamet Writing a Play About Harvey Weinstein and, between the two, I\u2019m much more tempted to see that.\u201d Should men be telling women\u2019s #MeToo stories at all? Of course, says Featherstone. \u201cWe can\u2019t start censoring writers.\u201d But she adds: \u201cIt is ironic that the only two plays which deal head-on with the predator are by two middle-aged men.\u201d</p> <p>Rothstein thinks this is symptomatic of imbalances in the industry. \u201cThe first major West End production of the #MeToo story is told by a white American male. This fact alone is indicative of a much deeper issue and the way in which the system is structured. It\u2019s not that Mamet shouldn\u2019t be writing about this incredibly topical issue. It\u2019s that his play should not be the only one that gets staged in the West End. You need everyone\u2019s perspective, including those of the survivors of abuse.\u201d</p> <p>Liv Warden\u2019s play <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jan/11/anomaly-review-old-red-lion-theatre-london-liv-warden\">Anomaly</a>, staged at the Red Lion theatre, London, in January, was about a fictional shamed media mogul. Warden made the decision not to have him appear on stage. He is a silenced character and his three daughters, who have to deal with the fallout of his misconduct, are the focus of her plot. \u201cWhen [Weinstein] was arrested,\u201d she says, \u201cI saw that he had a wife and two young children. One of my first thoughts was about them and how this was going to change their lives. I wanted to show the grey area. There is not the victim-predator divide here and there are questions of why the women connected with these men didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d</p> <p>But there are women in theatre who feel men\u2019s stories about this subject deserve to be heard, too, as long as they are delivered responsibly. Priscilla Holbrook is part of a production that dramatises the lives of male sex offenders in a rural American community. <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/america-is-hard-to-see\">America Is Hard to See</a>, which was staged at the Edinburgh fringe, is set to music and lyrics composed by Holbrook and is an investigative theatre piece based on verbatim interviews. \u201cWe see the victims mainly through the men\u2019s stories but this does not minimise them,\u201d says Holbrook. What is essential for drama about sex abuse, she adds, is for it to be attuned to the prospect of retraumatising those who have experienced it. \u201cYou have to ask, \u2018Does a piece of art retraumatise or does it nudge you to a bigger, expanded place?\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5f88b1686cad8051086933330ca7d6f919d61ef4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f88b1686cad8051086933330ca7d6f919d61ef4/221_121_2488_1493/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Testimonies distilled into drama \u2026 The Pussy Grabber Plays.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Testimonies distilled into drama \u2026 The Pussy Grabber Plays.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jenny Anderson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A hotel room scene in Bitter Wheat shows Malkovich\u2019s character attempting to have coercive sex with a young actress. \u201cIt\u2019s such an important scene,\u201d says Burns. \u201cI bet it\u2019s quite an eye-opener for men because they don\u2019t normally see what it\u2019s like for her \u2013 or they profess not to.\u201d</p> <p>Yet Berkoff and Mamet\u2019s dramas seemed so closely tethered to real events that they offer little insights beyond what we already know from news stories. \u201cWhen something has been in the news, what does theatre add to it?\u201d asks Featherstone.

      "bodyText": "Katie Arnstein tells a story of a day at drama school when a tutor told her to perform her graduation show in a bra \u201cbecause I\u2019m a blonde with a big chest\u201d. It is one of several experiences that informed Arnstein\u2019s solo show Sexy Lamp, performed at the Edinburgh fringe this month. The title comes from writer Kelly Sue DeConnick\u2019s theory that, if you can replace a female character with a lamp and the story still basically works, maybe you need another draft. Arnstein wrote her play, which features shocking revelations about auditions and casting call notices, because she felt so galvanised by the #MeToo movement that followed the numerous allegations of rape and sexual assault levelled at Harvey Weinstein since 2017. (Allegations he continues to deny in the run-up to his trial in September.) \u201cI was inspired by the strength shown by people who have called out abuse in the acting industry,\u201d Arnstein says. \u201cThis play is my version of the #MeToo story, my journey of being an actor and the challenges I continue to face because of my gender.\u201d She is not alone in putting abuse on the stage. Several playwrights have taken on the Weinstein story directly, treating the allegations in imaginative and sometimes incendiary ways. Among the first was David Mamet, known for his preoccupation with power and its abuse, often refracted through lethally predatory masculinity in his plays. He announced in early 2019 that he was working on Bitter Wheat, a \u201cdark farce\u201d starring John Malkovich as a shamed movie mogul called Barney Fein, who has uncanny similarities to Weinstein. Bitter Wheat landed with a thud this summer in London. But Steven Berkoff beat Mamet to the first, no-holds-barred play enacting the story from the predator\u2019s perspective with Harvey, a scrappy 45-minute monologue that was still being workshopped when it was performed in February at the Playground theatre in London. In a static performance, Berkoff sat in the centre of an almost bare stage wearing tracksuit bottoms and T-shirt. Delivering a monologue that was part-confession, part-justification of his acts, Berkoff\u2019s narcissistic, misogynistic character attempted to implicate the women who met him in hotel rooms. The monologue was interspersed with bilious summaries of abusive encounters, from hotel-room assaults to grim masturbatory episodes. The staging of Mamet and Berkoff\u2019s dramas raised questions of timing and sensitivity. Did we want to be inside the head of a sexual predator at a time when the unheard stories of women, and victims, were beginning to be dramatised? Other directors and playwrights mobilised plans of action to foreground women\u2019s perspectives. Vicky Featherstone, artistic director of the Royal Court, curated Snatches, a series of monologues for BBC4 with an all-female lineup of writers, directors and actors. Among them was Compliance, a drama written by Abi Morgan about a young female actor meeting a senior producer in a hotel bedroom to \u201crun through a scene\u201d. Its lead was played by Romola Garai, who was among the first women to speak out about Weinstein, describing an audition that took part in his hotel room at the Savoy when he opened the door to his room dressed in just a bathrobe. Garai, 18 at the time, reflected on how it left her feeling \u201cviolated\u201d but that such behaviour was accepted in an industry that was \u201cvery very very misogynistic\u201d. There were signs of a reckoning for silenced women from the past, too, the most prominent of which was Emilia, co-produced by Nica Burns, in which Morgan Lloyd Malcolm dramatised the life of Emilia Bassano, a poet and contemporary of William Shakespeare who, Lloyd Malcolm argues, was the unacknowledged inspiration for his plays. Commissioned in 2016, it was written after the Weinstein case made headlines, says Burns. \u201cEmilia could not get published in her time because she was a woman. It\u2019s all about women wanting their voices to be heard.\u201d Rose McGowan, who alleges she was raped by Weinstein, performed a one-woman show at Edinburgh this month, taking the audience \u201con a healing journey of discovery\u201d. More #MeToo plays by female writers are in the pipeline. Emily McLaughlin, head of new work at the National Theatre, speaks of an exceptional play in development by a writer \u201cwho has found a brilliant device to look at sexual abuse and harassment in the film industry\u201d. In the US, there has been an assortment of #MeToo-related dramas, including The Pussy Grabber Plays, inspired by the stories of women who had accused Donald Trump of sexual assault or harassment. Its co-creators, Kate Pines and Sharyn Rothstein, distilled their testimonies into drama. \u201cI felt very much that the women who had come forward over Trump were the precursors to the women who came forward over Weinstein,\u201d says Pines. \u201cThe stories about Trump had been largely ignored and relegated to a footnote of the elections.\u201d Natasha Stoynoff, a journalist whose story was dramatised in The Pussy Grabber Plays, thought it was important for her account to be preserved in a more complex way than she had seen it presented in news clips. \u201cKate and Sharyn wanted to go deeper into the women\u2019s stories \u2026 We\u2019d all become headshots flashed on a TV screen, like victims of a serial killer.\u201d She hopes it might serve as a comfort to women in similar situations \u2013 and help men, too. \u201cIf even one man walks out of the theatre more aware of his own actions regarding women and boundaries, that\u2019s progress,\u201d she says. Pines has reservations over Bitter Wheat. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in his perspective. The playwright Mathilde Dratwa has written A Play About David Mamet Writing a Play About Harvey Weinstein and, between the two, I\u2019m much more tempted to see that.\u201d Should men be telling women\u2019s #MeToo stories at all? Of course, says Featherstone. \u201cWe can\u2019t start censoring writers.\u201d But she adds: \u201cIt is ironic that the only two plays which deal head-on with the predator are by two middle-aged men.\u201d Rothstein thinks this is symptomatic of imbalances in the industry. \u201cThe first major West End production of the #MeToo story is told by a white American male. This fact alone is indicative of a much deeper issue and the way in which the system is structured. It\u2019s not that Mamet shouldn\u2019t be writing about this incredibly topical issue. It\u2019s that his play should not be the only one that gets staged in the West End. You need everyone\u2019s perspective, including those of the survivors of abuse.\u201d Liv Warden\u2019s play Anomaly, staged at the Red Lion theatre, London, in January, was about a fictional shamed media mogul. Warden made the decision not to have him appear on stage. He is a silenced character and his three daughters, who have to deal with the fallout of his misconduct, are the focus of her plot. \u201cWhen [Weinstein] was arrested,\u201d she says, \u201cI saw that he had a wife and two young children. One of my first thoughts was about them and how this was going to change their lives. I wanted to show the grey area. There is not the victim-predator divide here and there are questions of why the women connected with these men didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d But there are women in theatre who feel men\u2019s stories about this subject deserve to be heard, too, as long as they are delivered responsibly. Priscilla Holbrook is part of a production that dramatises the lives of male sex offenders in a rural American community. America Is Hard to See, which was staged at the Edinburgh fringe, is set to music and lyrics composed by Holbrook and is an investigative theatre piece based on verbatim interviews. \u201cWe see the victims mainly through the men\u2019s stories but this does not minimise them,\u201d says Holbrook. What is essential for drama about sex abuse, she adds, is for it to be attuned to the prospect of retraumatising those who have experienced it. \u201cYou have to ask, \u2018Does a piece of art retraumatise or does it nudge you to a bigger, expanded place?\u2019\u201d A hotel room scene in Bitter Wheat shows Malkovich\u2019s character attempting to have coercive sex with a young actress. \u201cIt\u2019s such an important scene,\u201d says Burns. \u201cI bet it\u2019s quite an eye-opener for men because they don\u2019t normally see what it\u2019s like for her \u2013 or they profess not to.\u201d Yet Berkoff and Mamet\u2019s dramas seemed so closely tethered to real events that they offer little insights beyond what we already know from news stories. \u201cWhen something has been in the news, what does theatre add to it?\u201d asks Featherstone. In recent years, she has seen \u201ca new anger and fearlessness in women\u2019s stories. And a sense of not needing to be liked or even a desire to create likable female characters on stage. The work that has been talked about since #MeToo was already in development before the Weinstein case.

Most inhabitants would certainly agree. But to love your country is not to think it greater than others, nor incapable of making grievous mistakes. Britain has not, as yet, made the fateful error of actually electing Boris Johnson and his cabinet of undesirables. Nor did it vote for a no-deal Brexit. But on he drives, accelerating towards the abyss.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s that insouciant ignorance that drives businesses mad; the devil-may-care fecklessness, ignoring the boring details. Andrea Leadsom, our improbable business secretary, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/08/24/will-do-everything-power-help-businesses-seize-vast-opportunities/\" title=\"\">writes in the Sunday Telegraph</a> that she has met firms of all kinds and guess what? \u201cThey were overwhelmingly positive about our future.\u201d She ends: \u201cBritain\u2019s best years for business and for all our people lie ahead.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>All three of these very different businesses make the same complaint. No one listens. They can\u2019t get the ear of any ministers</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Andrew Varga was driving along when he heard David Davis laughing on the Today programme as he expounded similar airy nonsense about the \u201ctrusted trader scheme\u201d \u2013 goods checked in warehouses away from the border, all easy-peasy.</p> \n<p>\u201cI was climbing the wall! Drives me to despair!\u201d says Varga, managing director of Seetru, a Bristol manufacturer of industrial safety valves. Perhaps Leadsom has only met happy businesses by refusing to hear from those like Varga, a Cambridge engineering PhD, who has failed to find a hearing with any branch of government for the inconvenient facts from companies like his.</p> \n<p>\u201cMy local Tory MP, Michelle Donelan, wouldn\u2019t come to the factory: when I saw her in her surgery she couldn\u2019t get rid of me fast enough.\u201d Labour MPs have listened and visited but no Tory to date. At a large meeting with Suella Braverman, then Brexit minister, she parroted the usual empty phrases: \u201ctrusted trader\u201d and \u201cWTO rules\u201d. Since 2016 he has been trying to raise the alarm, but \u201cno one wants to know\u201d. He wrote to the prime minister, who passed it on to Steve Baker, then at the Department for Exiting the European Union, but got a useless stock reply.</p> \n<p>At one time his exports were growing fast, with 130 employees and eight apprentices training to high standards, but since the referendum things have quickly changed. \u201cSome EU customers instantly decided it was too much trouble and switched to EU manufacturers \u2013 we lost 10% of the business.\u201d Others with his valves embedded will cut them out next time they redesign their machines. To trade in the EU he needs to obey rules of origin, recording every raw material, tracking every component, requiring \u201chorrendous\u201d new IT systems, his various valves containing 30,000 different configurations and \u201ctripling our admin workload\u201d. New security rules require fencing and guards round his perimeter with checks on staff, costing millions. Delays due to checks \u201care anathema to our just-in-time customers. They give us three chances: late once is a warning, twice is a final warning and then you\u2019re out.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b146305d-32c1-4dc9-9f4d-b60ce025264f\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>At 11pm UK time on 31 October the UK would, by default, become a \u201cthird country\u201d in terms of relations with the EU, with no overarching post-Brexit plan in place and no transition period. The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.<br></p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>This is not just about the bottom line. There are emotional shocks too. \u201cOur EU customers were our friends, but there was a sudden chill after 2016. I hear antagonism, nationalism rising, as if we are \u2018other\u2019 and not one of them any more. My people are upset by conversations with old customers who say: \u2018You bloody Brits! You\u2019re ruining everything, and we\u2019re not going to pay the extra duty.\u2019\u201d His office staff are remainers, but the factory floor is split in half. \u201cEveryone tiptoes around each other or it gets too heated. The Brexiters are aggressive, the remainers creep into their shell.\u201d</p> \n<p>His father praised 1972\u2019s entry into the common market. \u201cFantastic. Overnight just one gold standard for every product exported to every European country instead of a plethora of kite marks.\u201d When Brexiters castigate EU regulations, \u201cthey have no idea how good they are for us\u201d. Varga is a \u201ccongenitally liberal Tory, but I can no longer support that party\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2fdcfff7541718207b4bd7ea16be842000fd7dad\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2fdcfff7541718207b4bd7ea16be842000fd7dad/0_155_3080_1848/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Suella Braverman MP on ITV's Peston programme\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018At a large meeting with Suella Braverman, then Brexit minister, she parroted the usual empty phrases: \u201ctrusted trader\u201d and \u201cWTO rules\u201d.\u2019</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Hordle/ITV/REX/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Talk to others in quite different trades and the crescendo of despair rises as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/25/brexit-boris-johnson-britain-will-leave-eu-31-october-do-or-die\" title=\"\">\u201cdo or die\u201d day nears</a>. Chris Slowey, head of Manfreight, a hauliers in Northern Ireland with 300 employees and 120 indirect jobs, lists just some of the crises ahead: they take Kerry Foods from the Republic to places like Leeds, but with a no deal \u201ctaking just one quiche across the border needs three vet certificates, for the milk, the ham and the eggs.

Five jobs have been lost so far. \u201cEurope is our main market, lovely students bringing lovely money to Britain, a great export. But they sense they\u2019re not welcome, they think we\u2019re a bit xenophobic, a bit fascist \u2013 and they might need a visa. So they go to Ireland, whose schools are booming.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/25/brexit-no-deal-mps-panic\">A bumpy no-deal Brexit could turn panicking MPs against Johnson | Isabel Hardman</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>All three of these very different businesses make the same complaint. No one listens. They can\u2019t get the ear of any ministers. No one wants to know what Brexit is doing already, or the devastation no deal will cause to companies like theirs. They warn that bogus reassurances about the UK\u2019s preparedness will come unstuck. Lorry delays at ports may be sorted within weeks, but Varga says his problems are mostly \u201cfrog-boilers\u201d \u2013 the steady loss of customers that has started already. Why hasn\u2019t business shouted louder from day one? He tried, but others took fright in the face of hostile press coverage. He says businesses were warned that pro-leave customers would turn their back on products from companies that spoke out against Brexit.</p> \n<p>What these businesspeople share is sheer incredulity at what is happening, at politicians charging ahead deliberately remaining ignorant of the damage done. Expect the mighty \u00a3138m public information campaign to be empty propaganda. HMRC promises to contact \u201cevery known trader\u201d, but why bother when they refuse to hear what they\u2019d rather not know?

      "bodyText": "We\u2019ll easily cope,\u201d breezes the no-deal prime minister. \u201cThis is a great, great country.\u201d Indeed it is. Most inhabitants would certainly agree. But to love your country is not to think it greater than others, nor incapable of making grievous mistakes. Britain has not, as yet, made the fateful error of actually electing Boris Johnson and his cabinet of undesirables. Nor did it vote for a no-deal Brexit. But on he drives, accelerating towards the abyss. It\u2019s that insouciant ignorance that drives businesses mad; the devil-may-care fecklessness, ignoring the boring details. Andrea Leadsom, our improbable business secretary, writes in the Sunday Telegraph that she has met firms of all kinds and guess what? \u201cThey were overwhelmingly positive about our future.\u201d She ends: \u201cBritain\u2019s best years for business and for all our people lie ahead.\u201d Andrew Varga was driving along when he heard David Davis laughing on the Today programme as he expounded similar airy nonsense about the \u201ctrusted trader scheme\u201d \u2013 goods checked in warehouses away from the border, all easy-peasy. \u201cI was climbing the wall! Drives me to despair!\u201d says Varga, managing director of Seetru, a Bristol manufacturer of industrial safety valves. Perhaps Leadsom has only met happy businesses by refusing to hear from those like Varga, a Cambridge engineering PhD, who has failed to find a hearing with any branch of government for the inconvenient facts from companies like his. \u201cMy local Tory MP, Michelle Donelan, wouldn\u2019t come to the factory: when I saw her in her surgery she couldn\u2019t get rid of me fast enough.\u201d Labour MPs have listened and visited but no Tory to date. At a large meeting with Suella Braverman, then Brexit minister, she parroted the usual empty phrases: \u201ctrusted trader\u201d and \u201cWTO rules\u201d. Since 2016 he has been trying to raise the alarm, but \u201cno one wants to know\u201d. He wrote to the prime minister, who passed it on to Steve Baker, then at the Department for Exiting the European Union, but got a useless stock reply. At one time his exports were growing fast, with 130 employees and eight apprentices training to high standards, but since the referendum things have quickly changed. \u201cSome EU customers instantly decided it was too much trouble and switched to EU manufacturers \u2013 we lost 10% of the business.\u201d Others with his valves embedded will cut them out next time they redesign their machines. To trade in the EU he needs to obey rules of origin, recording every raw material, tracking every component, requiring \u201chorrendous\u201d new IT systems, his various valves containing 30,000 different configurations and \u201ctripling our admin workload\u201d. New security rules require fencing and guards round his perimeter with checks on staff, costing millions. Delays due to checks \u201care anathema to our just-in-time customers. They give us three chances: late once is a warning, twice is a final warning and then you\u2019re out.\u201d This is not just about the bottom line. There are emotional shocks too. \u201cOur EU customers were our friends, but there was a sudden chill after 2016. I hear antagonism, nationalism rising, as if we are \u2018other\u2019 and not one of them any more. My people are upset by conversations with old customers who say: \u2018You bloody Brits! You\u2019re ruining everything, and we\u2019re not going to pay the extra duty.\u2019\u201d His office staff are remainers, but the factory floor is split in half. \u201cEveryone tiptoes around each other or it gets too heated. The Brexiters are aggressive, the remainers creep into their shell.\u201d His father praised 1972\u2019s entry into the common market. \u201cFantastic. Overnight just one gold standard for every product exported to every European country instead of a plethora of kite marks.\u201d When Brexiters castigate EU regulations, \u201cthey have no idea how good they are for us\u201d. Varga is a \u201ccongenitally liberal Tory, but I can no longer support that party\u201d. Talk to others in quite different trades and the crescendo of despair rises as \u201cdo or die\u201d day nears. Chris Slowey, head of Manfreight, a hauliers in Northern Ireland with 300 employees and 120 indirect jobs, lists just some of the crises ahead: they take Kerry Foods from the Republic to places like Leeds, but with a no deal \u201ctaking just one quiche across the border needs three vet certificates, for the milk, the ham and the eggs. That\u2019ll take five times more vets and they\u2019re short already.\u201d He needs customs agents, who are in short supply. He buys 40 HGVs a year from Europe. \u201cEach will cost \u00a316,000 extra in tariffs, plus 16% on parts.\u201d Here\u2019s what just-in-time means for food deliveries \u2013 exactly 47 minutes from factory to ferry, two hours and 10 minutes crossing and eight hours max to stores in Leeds. \u201cAny delay and drivers have to stop and take a break, but food has a short shelf-life.\u201d He fears British stores will stop sourcing from Ireland \u2013 and until the Operation Yellowhammer leaks, neither he nor his Freight Transport Association had any warning of possible fuel shortages. \u201cJust let them see what happens when customers can\u2019t get what they want, people used to strawberries on Christmas Day.\u201d And here\u2019s Val Hennessy, director of International House, a large English language school in Bristol where Brexit is already \u201ca disaster\u201d. Five jobs have been lost so far. \u201cEurope is our main market, lovely students bringing lovely money to Britain, a great export. But they sense they\u2019re not welcome, they think we\u2019re a bit xenophobic, a bit fascist \u2013 and they might need a visa. So they go to Ireland, whose schools are booming.\u201d All three of these very different businesses make the same complaint. No one listens. They can\u2019t get the ear of any ministers. No one wants to know what Brexit is doing already, or the devastation no deal will cause to companies like theirs. They warn that bogus reassurances about the UK\u2019s preparedness will come unstuck. Lorry delays at ports may be sorted within weeks, but Varga says his problems are mostly \u201cfrog-boilers\u201d \u2013 the steady loss of customers that has started already. Why hasn\u2019t business shouted louder from day one? He tried, but others took fright in the face of hostile press coverage. He says businesses were warned that pro-leave customers would turn their back on products from companies that spoke out against Brexit. What these businesspeople share is sheer incredulity at what is happening, at politicians charging ahead deliberately remaining ignorant of the damage done. Expect the mighty \u00a3138m public information campaign to be empty propaganda. HMRC promises to contact \u201cevery known trader\u201d, but why bother when they refuse to hear what they\u2019d rather not know? Gordon Brown rightly calls for parliament to hold an independent inquiry into the consequences of a no-deal withdrawal, as Keir Starmer and the former head of the civil service Lord Kerslake demand that MPs be given all the facts. The prime minister threatens not to honour our EU debts, which would guarantee that no free trade deal could ever be signed. But, he says, none of this is for parliament to decide. As we head towards the cliff-edge, it seems only this most cavalier and feckless of prime ministers is allowed to \u201ctake back control\u201d. \u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist",

They might say it\u2019s over the top, but I\u2019d be surprised if anyone claimed \u201creally\u201d was being misused.</p> <p>But, in their origins, \u201creally\u201d and \u201cliterally\u201d aren\u2019t a million miles apart. Back in the 15th century, \u201creally\u201d wasn\u2019t used for emphasis, like in the tennis example. It meant \u201cin reality\u201d, or \u201cin fact\u201d, ultimately deriving from the Latin <em>res, </em>meaning \u201cthing\u201d. Explaining the religious doctrine of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucharist\">eucharist</a> in 1450, one author wrote \u201cwithin this bread all the sovereign good is put \u2026 bodily and really\u201d \u2013 and meant that the bread actually had the presence of Christ in it. Given time, the word came to mean something more like \u201cindeed\u201d: \u201cYou have really told a very pretty story\u201d (1751); and later still, it started to be used simply for emphasis: \u201cA really pretty maiden\u201d (1824).</p> <p>This is a fairly common process in language evolution, whereby words relating to the facts of a situation tend to become <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectification_(linguistics)\">more subjective</a>. They get bleached of their original meaning, and instead of saying something concrete about the matter at hand, say something about the speaker\u2019s feelings instead. They are used to convince, to emphasise or to intensify a comment. This happened with \u201creally\u201d but it also happened with \u201cvery\u201d (which used to mean \u201ctrue\u201d) and \u201cactually\u201d (which used to mean \u201cin action, rather than thought\u201d) \u2013 to the point that we have got completely used to those changes. Now it\u2019s happening to \u201cliterally\u201d.</p> <p>But literally hasn\u2019t quite settled into its new role. When Swift says \u201cI was literally at breaking point\u201d, it\u2019s fairly clear she\u2019s adding that word to beef her description up, to tell us quite how strongly she feels about what she went through. There are still many people for whom the concrete meaning sounds more natural, though \u2013 and it jars. Some of them may also hold to the false idea that a word\u2019s origin tells you what it should mean \u2013 but that\u2019s easily disproved (for example, \u201csilly\u201d has its origin in a word that meant \u201chappy\u201d).</p> <p>All of which is a roundabout way of saying it\u2019s fine to use literally, figuratively. It makes no sense to argue otherwise, unless you want to junk \u201creally\u201d too. In any case we\u2019ll all soon be doing it. As for Pinker\u2019s criticism? Just shake it off, Tay.</p> <p>\u2022 David Shariatmadari is the author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/don-t-believe-a-word-9781474608435.html\">Don\u2019t Believe A Word: The Surprising Truth About Language</a></p>",

This happened with \u201creally\u201d but it also happened with \u201cvery\u201d (which used to mean \u201ctrue\u201d) and \u201cactually\u201d (which used to mean \u201cin action, rather than thought\u201d) \u2013 to the point that we have got completely used to those changes. Now it\u2019s happening to \u201cliterally\u201d. But literally hasn\u2019t quite settled into its new role. When Swift says \u201cI was literally at breaking point\u201d, it\u2019s fairly clear she\u2019s adding that word to beef her description up, to tell us quite how strongly she feels about what she went through. There are still many people for whom the concrete meaning sounds more natural, though \u2013 and it jars. Some of them may also hold to the false idea that a word\u2019s origin tells you what it should mean \u2013 but that\u2019s easily disproved (for example, \u201csilly\u201d has its origin in a word that meant \u201chappy\u201d). All of which is a roundabout way of saying it\u2019s fine to use literally, figuratively. It makes no sense to argue otherwise, unless you want to junk \u201creally\u201d too. In any case we\u2019ll all soon be doing it. As for Pinker\u2019s criticism? Just shake it off, Tay. \u2022 David Shariatmadari is the author of Don\u2019t Believe A Word: The Surprising Truth About Language",

They have frequently called such projects \u201cwasteful spending\u201d. The Koch organization is also heavily invested in fossil fuels. Phoenix is the nation\u2019s fastest-growing city, according to the most recent US Census figures, but it\u2019s also been named the least sustainable, because of drought, the heat island effect caused by sprawling concrete infrastructure, and continued growth. And a 2018 study found the city is one of the five worst metropolitan areas in the country for air quality, with \u201cdegraded\u201d air quality for nearly one-third of the year. Light rail systems like Phoenix\u2019s offer public transportation options that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The first 20-mile stretch of light rail began operating in 2010, coinciding with a revitalization of the downtown area. Gallego said she has been a champion of light rail since her time as a city council member: \u201cI really want a city that invests in sustainable transportation.\u201d Opposition to the expansion began, however, because it would constrict a main car traffic route. Business and property owners along the planned expansion into south Phoenix criticized the plan because it would reduce the number of car lanes from four to two along Central Avenue, a major thoroughfare, and because of the effect this might have on businesses along the main roadway. Mel Martin, who owns Martin\u2019s Auto Museum as well as several properties and six buildings along the route, helped organize the effort and has put the most money into the campaign, according to campaign finance reports maintained by the city. \u201cWe felt like we were getting cheated,\u201d Martin said. \u201cWe went to the city council with a lot of reasons why they should give us four lanes,\u201d which is what occurred in another part of the city. But the council stuck with their original plans. That\u2019s when Martin and others, who dubbed their group \u201cFour Lanes or No Train\u201d, began considering a ballot measure that would stop the expansion. It\u2019s also when Scott Mussi, the executive director of the Arizona Free Enterprise Club, a not-for-profit that has been funded by multiple Koch brother-connected organizations, such as Americans For Prosperity and American Encore, began attending the meetings, Martin said. As the Phoenix New Times detailed earlier this month after reviewing emails between Mussi and the group\u2019s organizers, Mussi became involved in shaping the ballot measure, including the language on preventing any further expansion of the light rail, and organizing the petition-gathering effort required to get the question on the ballot. Mussi told Martin that no Koch brother money would be put into the effort, Martin said, so he was surprised to see in the latest campaign finance reports that Mussi personally contributed $40,000 to the committee, accounting for a little less than 10% of the total contributions made to the organization. \u201cThat was a shock to me,\u201d Martin said. Mussi did not return phone calls or emails requesting comment. Kory Langhofer, a Phoenix attorney who worked with the group, said that it was fair to compare the effort to stop light rail in Nashville, which was aided by Americans for Prosperity, to the current effort in Phoenix. But he said that Americans for Prosperity is not behind the current effort. \u201cAFP didn\u2019t author, direct or, as far as I know, even fund this project,\u201d Langhofer said. Langhofer has represented Americans for Prosperity in other cases, involving promoting school choice and opposing \u201cdark money\u201d disclosure laws. The campaign to keep the light rail expansion has been supported by a broad coalition of business groups, while the effort to stop light rail in Phoenix has been financially backed by only a small number of individuals, according the the most recent campaign finance filings. Both the mayor and the transit opponents say they will contest today\u2019s result. \u201cWe have plans if we lose,\u201d said Martin, \u201cbut I don\u2019t want to disclose that just yet.\u201d",

It\u2019s enough to trigger my bioabundance anxiety \u2013 a fear that the amount of life on Earth is fading away. I reflect that in the past, cycle rides in mid-August were characterised by a light rain of insects on exposed skin, thunderflies in the eyes; and a gaping mouth was punished by the speedy ingress of animals. Surely it would not have taken two miles of cycling before the first impact. A scatter of rooks stalk mechanically, pausing to pluck at invertebrate prey, on the green playing fields on the edge of the Nene floodplain south of Oundle. Around them a squadron of swallows skim and sweep; apparently there\u2019s enough insect life here to keep them interested. Back at home the nest in the back porch is overflowing with near-fledgings. Viewers of BBC Springwatch were shocked by nests of starving chicks of various species, perishing despite the best efforts of their parents, but here at least we should provide some new feathered bodies for the migration south. At Birdfair, the annual gathering sometimes referred to as the wildlife Glastonbury, talk keeps coming back to the vexed question of insect population size. The conservationists Ken and Linda Smith report finding hardly any insects in eastern woodlands, while a Lancashire woodland is blessed with a contrasting profusion; they wonder if water availability is the key to healthy woodland insect populations and if climate change is driving declines in abundance. The ecologist Lydia Robbins enthuses about a managed woodland that buzzes with life, while its non-intervention neighbour is silent. Where there is hard data, it describes declines in a majority of species of insects, and recent evidence of rapid collapses in flying insect bioabundance in Germany and Denmark has been deeply shocking. Some causes are obvious, but we are just awakening to this unfolding drama and learning how increasingly incongruous weather blends into climate change. Scientists have much work to do before we can clearly see the big picture and put personal experiences into context.",

As the former British colony\u2019s biggest political crisis since the handover to China continued into its 12th week, Lam denied on Tuesday that she had lost control of the situation and vowed to tackle the unrest and restore law and order. \u201cUnfortunately the calm vanished in the past weekend. The protests are becoming more and more violent,\u201d Lam told reporters before a cabinet meeting. \u201cI stress that violence is not the way to resolve problems and shouldn\u2019t be justified and glorified.\u201d The weekend protests, which followed a few days of relative calm, saw police use water cannon for the first time on Sunday along with teargas and beatings as they fought running battles with protesters, who threw bricks and petrol bombs. Six officers drew their pistols and one officer fired a warning shot into the air during a heated confrontation after the protest. Police said they detained 86 people over the weekend, including a 12-year-old child, for offences including unlawful assembly, possession of offensive weapons and assaulting police officers. The confrontations were the fiercest yet between police and demonstrators since early June, when a wave of protests started in opposition to an extradition bill under which individuals could be sent to mainland China for trial. The government suspended the bill in mid-June, but protesters demanded the government completely withdraw the bill, fearing it could be reintroduced again. The protests have since escalated into a broader anti-government, pro-democracy movement as Lam refused to formally retract the bill. Lam said again on Tuesday that she was \u201cnot accepting those demands\u201d and insisted that the bill \u201cwas stopped 2 months ago\u201d. In response to questions on whether the government will resort to declaring a state of emergency in view of the recent chaos, Lam said the government will use existing means in the legal framework to \u201cput a stop to violence and chaos\u201d. A state of emergency would pave way for the Hong Kong government to seek help from the Chinese army to deal with unrest. She insisted that the government would punish violent offenders whatever their political background, saying that police has also arrested dozens for an indiscriminate attack on civilians in a metro station and four of them had been charged with riot. She rejected calls for an independent body to police tactics. She also rejected suggestions that the government has lost control of Hong Kong and refused to step down, saying she wanted to \u201chold the fort and restore society to law and order\u201d. \u201cWe have to say \u2018no\u2019 to violence, end the chaotic situation with law enforcement, but we will not give up on the platform for dialogue,\u201d she said. Lam said last week she would establish platforms for dialogue with people from different political backgrounds, although protesters dismissed her offer and said she needed to respond to their demands. Demonstrators have five demands: the complete withdrawal of the now-suspended extradition bill; the setting up of an independent body to investigate police violence; a halt to the characterisation of protests as \u201criots\u201d; an amnesty for those arrested; and a resumption of political reform to allow the free election of Hong Kong\u2019s leader and legislature.",

That is the view of Amadou Bah, the executive director of Action Mines, a charity that monitors Guinea\u2019s mining industry. He said Russian companies \u201cderive enormous economic benefits for a Russian oligarchy that has considerable weight in the political and economic affairs of this country\u201d.</p> <p>For some years Russia\u2019s interests in Guinea have mostly been in mining. Guinea gets around a third of its revenues <a href=\"https://eiti.org/guinea\">from the extractive sector</a>.</p> <p>Rusal owns the <a href=\"https://rusal.ru/en/about/34/\">Kindia Bauxite Company</a> (CBK), which accounts for a third of Rusal\u2019s bauxite output, as well as the <a href=\"http://mines.gov.gn/en/projects/cobad/\">Dian-Dian Bauxite Company</a> and the <a href=\"https://rusal.ru/en/about/21/\">Friguia complex</a>, which mines bauxite and refines it into alumina.

Companies such as Rusal whose agreements were due to expire had them extended under the old terms for another 25 years. CBK\u2019s, for instance, was extended to 2050. According to a report by the extractive industry watchdog <a href=\"https://www.pwyp.org/\">Publish What You Pay</a>, it is exempt from paying taxes on land and salaries.</p> <p>\u201cThe Russians have a special status in Guinea. That explains the advantages given to their mining companies,\u201d said Bah, alleging that he knew of a secret agreement between the two countries.</p> <p>There is a difference between the Russian government and transnational companies, said Alexandra Arkhangelskaya of the Russian Academy of Sciences\u2019 Institute for African Studies, and the comment made by the ambassador \u201cprobably reflects the Russian attitude and the posture on global affairs,\u201d not Rusal\u2019s interests.</p> <p>Alexis Arieff, an Africa policy analyst at the US Congressional Research Service, said the spurs for Russian interest in African countries could be drawn as a Venn diagram. \u201cDoes the country have useful mineral resources, is the country ripe for challenging the influence of key western actors, is the country a market for Russian arms?\u201d she said. \u201cThose seem to be key circles that when they overlap may lead to greater Russian interest. The other circle that is certainly present in Guinea is: is there a historic Russian diplomatic and military relationship?\u201d</p> <p>Securing valuable votes on the UN security council and worrying western nations are two reasons for the Russian push in Africa, analysts say. Russia has succeeded in the latter: the US general responsible for military operations in Africa <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2019/02/07/politics/us-russia-mercenaries-africa/index.html\">said in February</a> that in CAR \u201celected leaders mortgage mineral rights for a fraction of their worth to secure Russian weapons\u201d.</p> <p>Russia is not the only foreign power with interests in Guinea, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/29/france-guinea-colonial-relationship\">firmly cut ties</a> with its former colonial master, France, after independence.

Do you know many presidents in Africa who do better?\u201d Alexander Bregadze asked in a new year\u2019s broadcast on state television. \u201cIt\u2019s constitutions that adapt to reality, not realities that adapt to constitutions.\u201d The opposition, civil society and the Guinean press were quick to criticise the ambassador\u2019s \u201cpopulist and demagogic\u201d meddling. \u201cHe\u2019s campaigning, supporting the president, encouraging the diplomatic corps to support a third term. It\u2019s anti-constitutional,\u201d said Alpha Bald\u00e9, of the opposition Guinean Democratic Forces Union. In May, leaving his post as ambassador, Bregadze took a job at the Russian aluminium firm Rusal. He now heads up Rusal\u2019s key unit in Guinea, home to its biggest mining interests. Russia has been trying to rekindle Soviet-era relationships with governments across the African continent and build new ties. Arms and military advisers have been supplied to countries such as the Central African Republic. Pro-Kremlin, regime-friendly \u201cobservers\u201d have been sent to fraught elections in Zimbabwe and the DRC, producing positive takes on elections marred by rigging and violence. While it cannot compete with China\u2019s economic might on the African continent, Russia is carving out its own role, focusing on relationships such as that with Guinea. Formerly a self-described Marxist socialist revolutionary state and the first French colony to become independent in Africa, Guinea was ideologically very important for the Soviet Union. Several activists claim Bregadze\u2019s comments are linked to Russia\u2019s economic interests in Guinea. That is the view of Amadou Bah, the executive director of Action Mines, a charity that monitors Guinea\u2019s mining industry. He said Russian companies \u201cderive enormous economic benefits for a Russian oligarchy that has considerable weight in the political and economic affairs of this country\u201d. For some years Russia\u2019s interests in Guinea have mostly been in mining. Guinea gets around a third of its revenues from the extractive sector. Rusal owns the Kindia Bauxite Company (CBK), which accounts for a third of Rusal\u2019s bauxite output, as well as the Dian-Dian Bauxite Company and the Friguia complex, which mines bauxite and refines it into alumina. Nordgold, another Russian company, owns a goldmine in northern Lefa, into which it is pumping ever-greater sums. Early in Cond\u00e9\u2019s first term, Guinea adopted a new mining code that it seemed would change the way mining companies operated, requiring them to pay more tax and protect the environment and the interests of communities around their mines. It was quickly revised when companies froze billions of dollars of investments in the country, and the government showed a willingness to relax the rules for favoured partners. Companies such as Rusal whose agreements were due to expire had them extended under the old terms for another 25 years. CBK\u2019s, for instance, was extended to 2050. According to a report by the extractive industry watchdog Publish What You Pay, it is exempt from paying taxes on land and salaries. \u201cThe Russians have a special status in Guinea. That explains the advantages given to their mining companies,\u201d said Bah, alleging that he knew of a secret agreement between the two countries. There is a difference between the Russian government and transnational companies, said Alexandra Arkhangelskaya of the Russian Academy of Sciences\u2019 Institute for African Studies, and the comment made by the ambassador \u201cprobably reflects the Russian attitude and the posture on global affairs,\u201d not Rusal\u2019s interests. Alexis Arieff, an Africa policy analyst at the US Congressional Research Service, said the spurs for Russian interest in African countries could be drawn as a Venn diagram. \u201cDoes the country have useful mineral resources, is the country ripe for challenging the influence of key western actors, is the country a market for Russian arms?\u201d she said. \u201cThose seem to be key circles that when they overlap may lead to greater Russian interest. The other circle that is certainly present in Guinea is: is there a historic Russian diplomatic and military relationship?\u201d Securing valuable votes on the UN security council and worrying western nations are two reasons for the Russian push in Africa, analysts say. Russia has succeeded in the latter: the US general responsible for military operations in Africa said in February that in CAR \u201celected leaders mortgage mineral rights for a fraction of their worth to secure Russian weapons\u201d. Russia is not the only foreign power with interests in Guinea, which firmly cut ties with its former colonial master, France, after independence. China signed a $20bn infrastructure-for-minerals deal in 2017, under which three Chinese companies get bauxite concessions. The Israeli billionaire Beny Steinmetz\u2019s company BSG Resources recently dropped out of a massive iron ore project after a long dispute. A Rusal spokesman said there was no conflict of interest regarding Bregadze\u2019s appointment and no \u201csecret strategic accords\u201d between Rusal and Guinea. Responding to a follow-up question clarifying that the alleged secret agreement was between Guinea and Russia, the spokesman said: \u201cThe clarification does not change our response. There are no such \u2018secret strategic accords\u2019 concerning Rusal.\u201d The Guinean foreign ministry and the Russian embassy in Conakry were approached for comment. Rusal will want to avoid a repeat of an incident in 2009 when its representative in Guinea was interrogated and berated on the then president\u2019s bizarre late-night television show over the neglect of the company\u2019s factory. Cond\u00e9\u2019s opponents have launched a campaign to prevent him from changing the constitution, and Russia\u2019s backing does not carry the weight that the USSR\u2019s did, according to Bah. \u201cRussia has nothing to teach us in terms of democracy or the functioning of the state,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s up to us to run and develop our country.\u201d Additional reporting by Fatoumata Kant\u00e9 in Conakry \u2022 This article was amended on 27 August 2019 because Rusal\u2019s Friguia complex mines bauxite and refines it into alumina, not aluminium as an earlier version said.",

      "bodyText": "The current New South Wales Labor secretary saw an Aldi bag filled with cash after a visit to the party\u2019s state headquarters by Chinese billionaire and banned donor Huang Xiangmo, a corruption inquiry has heard. The Independent Commission Against Corruption inquiry is examining the circumstances behind $100,000 in cash donations given to NSW Labor in 2015, about the time of the state election. The anti-corruption watchdog has heard evidence that the money came from Huang, a prolific political donor who was banned from re-entering Australia following concerns from security agencies. Huang is prohibited from donating in NSW due to his links to the Yuhu Group, a property developer. The Icac has already heard that 12 straw donors, or fake donors, may have been used to mask the true origin of the money. One of the donors has previously said that he was shocked to find his $500 contribution was inflated to $5,000 on official party records. On Tuesday, the inquiry heard that the current NSW Labor secretary, Kaila Murnain, saw the Aldi shopping bag filled with cash after Huang visited Labor\u2019s Sussex Street headquarters in April 2015. The then NSW Labor boss, Jamie Clements, handed the money to Labor\u2019s community relations director, Kenrick Cheah, to count and process, the inquiry has heard. Cheah gave evidence that Murnain, then the assistant NSW general secretary, knew the bag was filled with a \u201csizeable\u201d amount of cash. Cheah took the bag home because he said there were no secure places to put it in the office. \u201cPretty sure Kaila was the one who said \u2018be careful\u2019, just in terms of safety,\u201d Cheah said. Murnain is expected to be called to give evidence on Wednesday. Other witnesses have already been asked whether the large bag of cash aroused their curiosity, and what they did to ascertain its origins. Cheah underwent a heated cross-examination by Clements\u2019 barrister, Stephen Lawrence. It was put to Cheah that he had \u201cmade up\u201d evidence about Huang visiting Labor HQ with the cash. \u201cIt\u2019s not made up at all, it\u2019s 100% truthful,\u201d Cheah responded. The inquiry heard that Clements and Murnain immensely disliked each other. Lawrence accused Cheah of making scapegoats out of Clements and Huang and trying to \u201cdivert\u201d investigations into who really brought the money in. \u201cI didn\u2019t use anyone as a scapegoat. I just told the facts as they happened to me, or as they occurred to me,\u201d Cheah said. Murnain has previously told Icac investigators that former state MP Ernest Wong had told her the true source of the funds was Huang. Labor records purport to show the $100,000 came from a series of individual donors who attended a Chinese Friends of Labor fundraising dinner in March 2015. At the dinner, Huang was seated at the head table, along with the former Labor leader Bill Shorten. Cheah was asked how Huang managed to get a seat at the head table. \u201cBecause he\u2019s a rich man. You don\u2019t want to offend a rich and powerful guy,\u201d Cheah said. Chief commissioner Peter Hall asked whether being rich and powerful was a criterion for securing prime position at such functions. Cheah said it may have been because Huang was a \u201cluminary\u201d in his community. The inquiry heard that donations were usually made in a variety of payment methods, including cash, cards and cheques. But the $100,000 given to Cheah to count was only in cash. Hall asked Cheah whether he thought this was \u201chighly unusual\u201d, and whether it \u201caroused your curiosity\u201d. \u201cYes, it does seem unusual,\u201d Cheah said. Hall replied: \u201cWell there\u2019s no need to qualify it, it was unusual, on the strength of your evidence that it was normal to have a mixed method of payment.\u201d Cheah said he took no steps to ask anyone why all $100,000 was in cash. The inquiry continues on Tuesday, and is expected to last six weeks.",

      "bodyText": "Ferdinand Piech, the Porsche family patriarch who transformed Volkswagen from a struggling carmaker into a global powerhouse, has died at the age of 82. Piech, the grandson of sports car and VW Beetle pioneer Ferdinand Porsche, died on Sunday in Rosenheim, Bavaria, his wife said. \u201cMy husband ... died suddenly and unexpectedly on 25 August,\u201d Ursula Piech said, after a life \u201cmarked by a passion for cars and the employees who build them\u201d. A representative for the Piech and Porsche families, who still control a majority stake in Volkswagen through their family holding company Porsche SE, had no immediate comment. Volkswagen could not be reached for comment. Born in Vienna, Piech was a brilliant engineer who led VW from 1993 to 2002 before becoming head of the supervisory board until 2015. He left amid the so-called \u201cdieselgate\u201d scandal when it was discovered the company had programmed millions of cars to fool exhaust emissions tests. Piech began his career at Porsche in the 1960s before moving to VW\u2019s upmarket brand, Audi, in 1972 which he turned into a credible competitor to Mercedes-Benz and BMW. After becoming boss of VW in 1993 he gambled on a modular construction technique which allowed Audi, Skoda and VW brands to share up to 65% common parts, helping the group to shift from midsized carmaker to an international titan. \u201cFirst and foremost I always saw myself as a product person, and relied on gut instinct for market demand. Business and politics never distracted me from the core of our mission: to develop and make attractive cars,\u201d Piech wrote in his autobiography. During his nine-year tenure Piech turned a loss equivalent of \u20ac1bn ($1.11bn) into a \u20ac2.6bn profit while spearheading VW\u2019s expansion into a 12-marque empire that includes the Seat, Skoda, Bentley, Audi, Porsche, Bentley and Ducati brands in addition to MAN and Scania trucks. Piech was known for his ability to outmanoeuvre competitors by stoking internal rivalries to his own advantage, even if it resulted in turning against his own managers, including the VW chief executive Bernd Pischetsrieder, to side with VW\u2019s labour leaders. While working as a 31-year old development chief at Porsche in 1968, he invested two-thirds of Porsche\u2019s annual racing budget to build 25 Porsche 917 race cars with an untested radical 600 horsepower air-cooled 12-cylinder engine design. Family members accused Piech of being irresponsible by risking the company\u2019s budget but the Porsche 917 went on to become one of the most successful race cars in history. \u201cIt is not possible to take a company to the top by focusing on the highest level of harmony,\u201d said Piech, who has 12 children with four different women. While working as development chief at Audi, Piech decided to keep his top engineers in the dark about the aerodynamic qualities of the Audi 100 by using wind tunnels in Hamburg, Stuttgart, Wolfsburg and Turin to develop the vehicle.
