      "bodyText": "Senate Republicans have a new plan for preventing mass shootings: require public schools to use surveillance technology to monitor students\u2019 online behavior for signs of violence or self-harm. A new Republican bill that claims \u201cto help prevent mass shootings\u201d includes no new gun control measures. Instead, Republican lawmakers are supporting a huge, federally mandated boost to America\u2019s growing school surveillance industry. Millions of American students, across thousands of school districts, are already being monitored by tech companies that scan everything they write in school emails, chats and shared documents, looking for signs of suicidal thoughts or plans for a school shooting. This surveillance technology doesn\u2019t turn off when the school day is over: anything students type in official school accounts is monitored 24 hours a day, whether they are in their classrooms or their bedrooms. There is still no research evidence that demonstrates whether or not online monitoring of schoolchildren actually works to prevent violence. Despite this, new legislation introduced Wednesday by Senator John Cornyn, a Texas Republican and longtime ally of the National Rifle Association (NRA), would update the Children\u2019s Internet Protection Act to mandate that public schools adopt \u201ca technology protection measure that detects online activities of minors who are at risk of committing self-harm or extreme violence against others\u201d. A spokesperson for Cornyn did not immediately respond to a request for comment on why he and other Senate Republicans are mandating that public schools adopt a new technology before there is any clear evidence that it\u2019s effective in preventing violence. The Cornyn bill, entitled the Response Act, includes a range of other policies without strong evidence of reducing mass shootings, including expediting the federal death penalty for perpetrators of mass shootings, a priority of Donald Trump. Privacy advocates say pervasive surveillance is not appropriate for an educational setting, and that it may actually harm children, particularly students with disabilities and students of color, who are already disproportionately targeted with school disciplinary measures. \u201cYou are forcing schools into a position where they would have to surveil by default,\u201d said Amelia Vance, the director of education privacy at the Future of Privacy Forum. \u201cThere\u2019s a privacy debate to be had about whether surveillance is the right tactic to take in schools, whether it inhibits students trust in their schools and their ability to learn,\u201d Vance said. But \u201cthe bottom line,\u201d she said, is \u201cwe do not have evidence that violence prediction works\u201d. There\u2019s no hard data on how many public schools are already monitoring what students write 24 hours a day. But Vance estimates that only a third of US school districts, at most, currently use this technology. If Cornyn\u2019s bill becomes law, \u201cyou\u2019re going to force probably 10,000 districts to buy a new product that they\u2019re going to have to implement\u201d, she said. That would mean redirecting public schools\u2019 time and money away from strategies that are backed by evidence, such as supporting mental health and counseling services, and towards dealing with surveillance technologies, which often produce many false alarms, like alerts about essays on To Kill a Mockingbird. Fear of school shootings has already fueled rapid growth in the school surveillance industry, particularly after a school shooting in Parkland, Florida, last year left 17 people dead. Companies that sell this technology are marketing it to schools with bold claims of lives saved \u2013 numbers based only on internal, anecdotal estimates, not independent analysis. One leading school surveillance company, Gaggle, says its technology is currently used to monitor 4.5 million students across 1,400 school districts.

Another company, Bark says it works with at least 1,400 school districts across the country, and claims its technology has helped prevent \u201c16 credible school shootings\u201d and detected \u201ctwenty thousand severe self-harm situations\u201d. Bark, which sells a for-profit app to help parents monitor what their children are doing online, offers its surveillance technology to schools for free. First passed in 2000, the Children\u2019s Internet Protection Act was originally designed to make sure that American kids would not be looking at porn on taxpayer-funded school computers. It currently requires schools to monitor students\u2019 \u201conline activities\u201d, although privacy experts say that what that means \u2013 and what constitutional limits there may be on the monitoring \u2013 have never been clearly defined.",

In 2018 Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld disappeared as a result.</p>\n    <p>In terms of habits, shoppers are switching to buying online. The likes of Amazon have an unfair advantage because they have a lower business rate bill, which holds down costs and enables online retailers to woo shoppers with low prices. Business rates are taxes, based on the value of commercial property, that are imposed on traditional retailers with physical stores.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>At the same time, there is a move away from buying \u2018stuff\u2019 as more people live in smaller homes and rent rather than buy. Those pressures have come just as rising labour and product costs, partly fuelled by Brexit, have coincided with economic and political uncertainty that has dampened consumer confidence.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What help do retailers need?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Retailers with a high-street presence want the government to change business rates. They also want more political certainty as the potential for a no deal Brexit means some are not only incurring additional costs for stockpiling goods but are unsure about the impact of tariffs after October 2019. Retailers also want more investment in town centres to help them adapt to changing trends, as well as a cut to high parking charges which they say put off shoppers.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the government doing?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In the October 2018 budget the government announced&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/26/budget-to-offer-business-rates-relief-for-small-shops\">some relief</a>&nbsp;on business rates for independent shopkeepers. It has also set up a \u00a3675m \u2018future high streets\u2019 fund under which local councils can bid for up to \u00a325m towards regeneration projects such as refurbishing local historic buildings and improving transport links. The fund will also pay for the creation of a high street taskforce to provide expertise and hands-on support to local areas.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the outlook in 2019?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Some retailers could go under. Weakened by a difficult Christmas \u2013 which accounts for the entire annual profits of many retailers, and with further Brexit wobbles to come \u2013 retailers are facing a tough 2019. Another rise in the national minimum wage in April and the falling value of the pound against the dollar, which is used to buy goods in the far east, have also added to costs and hit profits.</p>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>More pain could be on the way as research from analysts Retail Economics for advisory firm Alvarez &amp; Marsal suggests major chains have 20% too much store space as a result of a fivefold rise in online shopping in the past decade.

      "bodyText": "The English Football League is to fund research into match-day policing aimed at managing potential flashpoints with a more progressive approach to supporters. The long-term objective of the study is for the police to deploy fewer officers at games. The project, termed \u201cEnable\u201d, carried out observations at five matches last season and reached three key findings: the risks of violence were generally lower than the police had expected, too many officers were on duty and too few talked to supporters. It also suggested forces did not respond by reducing officer numbers when information based on \u201cvery weak\u201d evidence proved unfounded. The EFL hopes supporting research and match observations for a further two years will help reduce costs and the number of officers allocated to matches. Enable, led by academics Prof Clifford Stott and Dr Geoff Pearson, cites an estimated annual cost of \u00a348m to police professional football, of which only \u00a35m is borne by clubs since they are legally responsible only for policing on land they own or control on match days. Last season\u2019s Enable report concluded that high deployment of officers, including those trained for riot and public order control, was often unnecessary and could actually escalate tensions. It also proved too costly and took resources away from more pressing areas of policing. \u201cDespite the good practices we observed, such high levels of resourcing are not sustainable, and consideration must be given to ways of reducing the demand and level of resourcing involved in policing football,\u201d the report said. Several forces have made changes following work by Enable, including the deployment of police liaison teams tasked with talking to supporter groups and placing less emphasis on police riot squads. West Yorkshire police, whose recently retired chief superintendent, Owen West, is a senior consultant with Enable, have reduced their deployments at Leeds, Huddersfield and Bradford. Lancashire police, also part of Enable, reported this week it had cut its resources by 35% from last season for Leeds\u2019 visit to Preston and there had been no incidents of disorder and no arrests at Tuesday\u2019s match. John Nagle, the EFL\u2019s head of policy, said: \u201cThe aim of the project is to promote collaboration between football clubs and police forces to encourage a progressive dialogue about the best, most efficient ways to police football matches and help develop cutting edge crowd management techniques, and so to improve the match-day experience for supporters and help reduce the financial burden on club and policing budgets.\u201d One of last season\u2019s matchday observations found that a group of away fans police had designated as \u201chigh risk\u201d potential troublemakers were in fact less inclined to disorder than the pre-match intelligence.

Firstly the rise in the schooling age and the general increase in the importance of education mean more teenagers stay in school than in the past, and secondly, those over 65 are now much more likely to work.</p> <p>In 1979 fewer than 7% of those over 65 were in the labour force; now over 14% are:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Over 65s participation rate\">  <iframe title=\"Over 65s participation rate\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/5jDfF/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The big rise began in the early 2000s, coinciding with the mining boom. Between 2004 and 2012, both men and women over 65 increased their participation quite steadily.</p> <p>But then the rate of men working levelled off.

      "bodyText": "One consequence of the government\u2019s desire for the Reserve Bank to do most of the work to stimulate growth has been the fall in interest rates, making life tough for savers \u2013 especially those who were planning to retire. Right now, there is a greater percentage of adults in the labour force than ever before. A large reason for that is the increase in women entering the workforce, but another important factor is pressure on older workers putting off retirement. As of July this year the retirement age in Australia is 66 years. After two years, it will rise again to 66-and-a-half, and in July 2023 it will reach 67. The main reason for the policy decision to raise the pension age was the ageing of our population \u2013 a trend which can be clearly seen in a comparison of two age groups. Forty years ago, the number of 15- to 19-year-olds roughly matched the number of Australians over the age of 65. Now, around 4 million people are over 65, with just 1.5 million aged 15-19: Forty years ago, working with someone over 65 was pretty rare. On the current trend, within a couple years there will be more over-65s in the workplace than 15- to 19-year-olds: There are a couple reasons for this. Firstly the rise in the schooling age and the general increase in the importance of education mean more teenagers stay in school than in the past, and secondly, those over 65 are now much more likely to work. In 1979 fewer than 7% of those over 65 were in the labour force; now over 14% are: The big rise began in the early 2000s, coinciding with the mining boom. Between 2004 and 2012, both men and women over 65 increased their participation quite steadily. But then the rate of men working levelled off. From 2012 until the middle of 2017, the participation of men over 65 remained around 17%, while the rate for women over 65 rose from 7% to over 9%. Then, from the middle of 2017, coinciding with the first rise in the pension age from 65 to 65-and-a-half, the participation rate of men over 65 took off. The retirement age is not the only factor in play, however. In the past two years, we also saw a very strong rise in the participation rate of men aged 60-64 \u2013 an increase not in step with the trend among younger men. The rise in the participation rate of women is steady across all ages \u2013 if anything, it is more pronounced among women in their 20s and 30s. But for men, it is all about older workers: What was also happening in 2017 was that earning income from the interest on term deposits became much less viable. Throughout the mining boom years, and even through the global financial crisis, life was pretty good for those with superannuation nest eggs earning interest in term deposits. Between 2002 and 2012, the average real interest rate you could get for \u201cspecial\u201d term deposits of a minimum $10,000 was 2.6% \u2013 that is, 2.6% points higher than the inflation rate. That is a very sweet deal. A 2.6% real return for essentially no risk? Sign me up! But by 2017, the falling cash rate (set by the Reserve Bank) had caused term deposit rates to fall so far that they were barely above inflation. In 2017 the average term deposit rate was 2.3% while inflation was running at 1.9% \u2013 a mere 0.4% real return. Now, the average term deposit rate is even lower \u2013 around 1.3% below the most recent inflation rate of 1.6%. That\u2019s an investment that will make your money worth less in real terms than it was when you gave it to the bank. It does not make for a fun retirement \u2013 and certainly not a situation that has you thinking you can afford to retire if you are nearing 65. And so the confluence of a rising retirement age and falling interest rates has led to an increase in the number of over-65s working. This has an impact on a broader level. One of the reasons the Reserve Bank and the treasurer thought the recent solid employment growth would lift wages was they believed it would lead to a fall in the unemployment rate. But greater participation means you need more new jobs just to keep the unemployment rate steady; as a result the rise in participation has meant the recent job growth has not been enough to lower unemployment and put upward pressure on wages. Had the over-65 participation rate remained where it was in August 2017, the overall participation rate would be 0.3% points lower: That translates to significant gain in the number of older workers whose jobs could be filled by younger people looking for work (or for more hours). There is nothing wrong with older people staying in work, and it sure as heck is not their fault that wages growth is lower than it should be. But it highlights the real consequences of fiscal policy that has forced the Reserve Bank to cut rates rather than hold them higher due to growth being buoyed by fiscal stimulus. In effect, it sets up a vicious circle where lower rates reinforce low wages growth, which is one of the reasons that lower interest rates are needed. And it means retiring will continue to be a tough choice for many. \u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

Specifically, the 2018 blockbuster <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/06/black-panther-review-marvel-wakanda-chadwick-boseman\">Black Panther</a>, in which Nyong\u2019o starred as Nakia, a spy for Wakanda\u2019s Afro-futurist, all-female army the Dora Milaje.</p> <p>It seems that between the 17th and 19th centuries, the Dora Milaje had a real-life equivalent: the Agoji, from the Kingdom of Dahomey in present-day Benin. Armies of eroticised, exoticised and \u201cunnaturally\u201d aggressive women are a common trope in the victor-written history of colonial expansion, but the Dahomey Amazons are also familiar for other reasons. Soon after Nyong\u2019o\u2019s arrival in Benin, she was taken to the palace in Abomey where a centuries-old frieze depicted panthers and crossed swords. \u201cAll the kings of Dahomey are the children of the Panther King,\u201d said the palace guide, to Nyong\u2019o\u2019s amazement. The question of where Marvel should send the royalties cheque was not addressed.</p> <p>This is news to Nyong\u2019o because, while she may be the most prominent African in Hollywood (Djimon Hounsou? Charlize Theron?) she is not from round here. Did you know Africa is a hugely diverse continent, home to more than 3,000 ethnic groups speaking some 2,000 languages?

      "bodyText": "Channel 4\u2019s Black History season continues with this reminder that when television ignores African history, it deprives us of some astounding stories. The story told by the Oscar-winner Lupita Nyong\u2019o in this one-off documentary is like something out of a blockbuster Hollywood movie. Specifically, the 2018 blockbuster Black Panther, in which Nyong\u2019o starred as Nakia, a spy for Wakanda\u2019s Afro-futurist, all-female army the Dora Milaje. It seems that between the 17th and 19th centuries, the Dora Milaje had a real-life equivalent: the Agoji, from the Kingdom of Dahomey in present-day Benin. Armies of eroticised, exoticised and \u201cunnaturally\u201d aggressive women are a common trope in the victor-written history of colonial expansion, but the Dahomey Amazons are also familiar for other reasons. Soon after Nyong\u2019o\u2019s arrival in Benin, she was taken to the palace in Abomey where a centuries-old frieze depicted panthers and crossed swords. \u201cAll the kings of Dahomey are the children of the Panther King,\u201d said the palace guide, to Nyong\u2019o\u2019s amazement. The question of where Marvel should send the royalties cheque was not addressed. This is news to Nyong\u2019o because, while she may be the most prominent African in Hollywood (Djimon Hounsou? Charlize Theron?) she is not from round here. Did you know Africa is a hugely diverse continent, home to more than 3,000 ethnic groups speaking some 2,000 languages? Yep, and sadly, that still needs saying, so Nyong\u2019o said it: \u201cI just get frustrated when other people assume we\u2019re all the same!\u201d Indeed, according to Ancestry DNA, your 19% Benin-by-way-of-Jamaica reviewer has as good a chance as Nyong\u2019o of being descended from a fearsome Agoji warrior.

In subsequent emails between the Telegraph and Moore\u2019s office, the paper justified the figures using a document supplied by Taylor\u2019s office, purporting to be the council\u2019s annual report. City of Sydney\u2019s publicly available annual report shows councillors spent $1,727.77 on overseas travel and $4,206.32 on domestic travel. In total, the council spent $229,000 on travel during 2017-18, under its $300,000 budget. But the document provided to the Telegraph shows wildly different figures, which appeared in a strange format unlike the one used elsewhere in the annual report. It is unclear who altered the document. There is no suggestion that Taylor himself was responsible. The council is adamant that it did not alter the figures. It said it had checked the metadata to establish that the report had not been changed on its website since being posted in November 2018. On the Sunday night before publication of the Telegraph\u2019s story, the council spokesman tried desperately to convince the Telegraph its story was wrong. Moore\u2019s staff had not yet seen Taylor\u2019s letter. It was waiting for them in the office the next morning. Taylor\u2019s letter began by outlining how the government had a comprehensive set of policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, before telling Moore: \u201cYou might be interested to know that there are many practical ways local councils can take real and meaningful action to reduce their carbon emissions. \u201cOne way was to limit unnecessary air travel,\u201d he said, before quoting the erroneous figures. Meanwhile, that morning the Telegraph journalist was being asked by the council to stand up the claims she had made in the story by quoting Taylor. \u201cTaylor\u2019s office printed a copy of your annual report out on September 6,\u201d she wrote in an email to the council\u2019s communications manager. \u201cI have a copy of those relevant pages which I\u2019ll forward you in a second email. But they say that the cost of interstate visits was $14.2 million and overseas visits was $1.7 million. \u201cIf you look online now, that report has been changed or updated to say interstate visits were $4206 and overseas visits were $1727.\u201d A spokesman for the City of Sydney told the Guardian: \u201cI think she was as upset to have been taken for a ride as we were.\u201d Taylor declined to answer detailed questions from Guardian Australia about the document, instead branding it a conspiracy theory by the lord mayor and saying: \u201cI make no apologies.\u201d His letter sent Moore into a rage on Twitter. Moore wrote to Taylor again on Tuesday saying she was referring the Daily Telegraph to the Press Council over its erroneous reporting and asking Taylor for his version of events. \u201cCould you verify The Daily Telegraph\u2019s claims that the erroneous documents originated in your office, or is my office being misled by the newspaper\u2019s journalists?\u201d Moore wrote. \u201cIt is my deep belief that in dealing with important and pressing issues, it is our responsibility as elected officials to deal in facts. Providing false information to journalists and the public further erodes the community\u2019s confidence in elected representatives to lead and serve.\u201d Moore pointed out that the City of Sydney was the first government in Australia to be certified as carbon neutral in 2011 and has offset all emissions, including from flights, since then. This week it signed an agreement to source 100% of its power from wind and solar and its emissions were down 25% to date on 2006. On Thursday morning Taylor issued a statement saying: \u201cI make no apology for suggesting that the Lord Mayor should take real and meaningful action to reduce the City of Sydney\u2019s carbon emissions instead of hollow virtue-signalling through letters.\u201d \u201cOne way to reduce emissions is through limiting unnecessary air travel and I suggest that the Lord Mayor\u2019s flights to Paris for the Women for Climate conference was an unnecessary indulgence.\u201d Moore, the City of Sydney\u2019s chief executive, Monica Barone and her chief of staff, Shehana Teixeira, travelled to Paris in March to attend this year\u2019s Women4Climate Summit. The 2020 conference, which promotes the involvement of young women in action to counter the climate emergency, will be held in Sydney at the Town Hall. A spokesman for the Daily Telegraph said: \u201cThe Daily Telegraph reported on the fact a letter was sent by Federal Minister for Energy Angus Taylor to Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore. \u201cThe letter was newsworthy in its own right and we approached Ms Moore for comment. She disputed figures quoted in Mr Taylor\u2019s letter. The Daily Telegraph accurately reported her response,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Andy Hunter has filed his match report from Genk, so I\u2019ll leave you with that. Thanks for your company - goodnight! Ajax 0-1 Chelsea was the score in tonight\u2019s earlier game. Read all about it. Red Bull Salzburg 2-3 Napoli Unsurprisingly, the other Group E game was a cracker. Napoli nicked it despite two more goals from Erling Braut Haaland. Salzburg have scored 11 goals in three games - but they have lost the last two and will do well to qualify from here. In a way I hope they don\u2019t, because they would be a very lively addition to the Europa League. Peep peep! Liverpool end their run of away defeats in their Champions League group stage with an ultimately comfortable victory. They had too much class and too much nous, even if the scoreline is harsh on a charming Genk side. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain scored twice, the second a delicious goal, with Sadio Mane and Mo Salah getting the others. Liverpool go top of the group and should - should - qualify without alarm from here. 90+1 min Ianis Hagi - yep, him - comes on to replace the impressive Junya Ito. 90 min Three minutes of added time. 89 min \u201cJust thinking what our best midfield three would be if all players were fit and firing,\u201d writes Johnny. \u201cI\u2019d say Fabinho is nailed on, so that leaves Ox/Henderson/Gigi/Milner/Keita/Lallana. That\u2019s quite a strong bunch to choose from! I do think we need someone with a bit more drive than Henderson so would happily have Ox in there as a regular. The season before last he was immense before the injury.\u201d The selection for the City game will be interesting, especially given Oxlade-Chamberlain\u2019s form against them in 2017-18. I agree about Fabinho, who has no obvious replacement. Genk deserve that consolation goal. Uronen bullies Keita off the ball down the left and plays the ball infield to the substitute Ndongala. He twists past Gomez and cuts tbe ball back towards the other substitute Odey, who beats Alisson with a nice shot on the turn from eight yards. Another delightful goal! Salah receives Mane\u2019s pass ball on the edge of the area with his back to goal, wriggles through a non-existent space between Cuesta and Lucami and drags the ball in off the far post with his right foot. The turn was delicious. 84 min Wijnaldum blasts a cross shot just wide. 83 min \u201cGoals from the edge of the box are invaluable for Liverpool,\u201d says Niall Mullen. \u201cWe lack the Man City whirligig that creates space and clear-cut opportunities in and around the box against low block defences. Ox\u2019s ability to stick it top or bottom bins should, in theory, create more space in behind as defenders rush out to block.\u201d Yes, goalscoring from midfield is one of Liverpool\u2019s few weaknesses. I\u2019m not sure who he would replace though. Henderson, at his best, is a really important player. I\u2019ve never been that impressed by Wijnaldum, though I have a vague sense he does things I\u2019m not intelligent enough to understand. 82 min Berge belts one over the bar from distance. It was beautifully struck but a few inches too high. He looks a good player, though. 81 min Stephen Odey replaces Paul Onuachu for Genk. In the other game, Napoli are leading 3-2 in Salzburg. 80 min Divock Origi, who came through the ranks at Genk before leaving for Lille, is warmly applauded by both sets of fans as he comes on to replace Roberto Firmino. That defeat has been confirmed. Firmino finds Salah, who stabs a dainty through pass on the turn towards Mane. He charges onto the ball and lifts it confidently over Coucke. Lovely goal. 76 min That second goal flattened Genk\u2019s morale. They look resigned to defeat now. 73 min Gini Wijnaldum replaces the matchwinner Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. 71 min The Norwegian Sander Berge has had a quietly impressive match in the Genk midfield. He reads the game really well for a 21-year-old, with and without the ball. 70 min Gomez shows impressive pace to beat Ndongala to a through ball from Ito - and then gets himself booked by stopping Ndongala taking a quick throw-in. 69 min \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Drew Gough. \u201cFrom the Fun Fact Department: I\u2019m watching this game in Turkey on a Turkish BeIn Sports feed, and the announcer calls every player by his last name except for James Milner, who is called by both names every time. Hashtag respect hashtag legend.\u201d I\u2019d like to hear commentators double down and call him James Philip Milner. 68 min Oxlade-Chamberlain\u2019s deep, floated corner is headed over by van Dijk. 67 min \u201cMillings!\u201d says Matt Maradony (sic). \u201cMillings has made my heart grow two sizes. I\u2019m only just catching up with the action, as I\u2019ve been puffing and panting around a five-a-side pitch. (One screamer off the post and in, and one goal conceded via a big ol\u2019 annoying nutmeg. The beautiful game.) Two-nil up against the mighty Genk. Number seven in the post.\u201d 66 min A change for Genk: Dieumerci Ndongala replaces the relatively anonymous Theo Bongonda. 64 min \u201cDoes this mean Oxlade-Chamberlain is hitting pre-injury form?\u201d says Roger Theberge. I actually thought he was better in general play when he came on at Old Trafford, but the second goal tonight was a timely reminder of his class. At his best, he\u2019s certainly good enough to be a regular starter for Liverpool and England. 63 min Andy Robertson, who has had a fairly tricky night defensively, is replaced by Joe Gomez. James Milner will move to left-back. 62 min It\u2019s been a good week for the forgotten midfielders of Liverpool. 59 min A good inswinging corner from the left is flicked on and wide of the far post by Samatta. That was half a chance. That\u2019s one of the most stylish goals we\u2019ll see in this season\u2019s Champions League. Firmino played a simple pass back to Oxlade-Chamberlain, lurking inside the D, and he stabbed an insouciant first-time shot with the outside of the boot that curved around Coucke, hit the underside of the bar and dropped into the net. Glorious stuff. It is now! This is an outrageous goal from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain! 55 min Liverpool are still looking unusually sloppy, and Van Dijk administers a rollocking to someone after heading Ito\u2019s cross behind. Their away form will determine what they win this season, because they should win at least 90 per cent of their home games. At the moment it\u2019s not great. 52 min \u201cKlopp\u2019s Liverpool v Houllier\u2019s Liverpool sort of happened in 2001,\u201d says Niall Mullen. \u201cOld Ged cannily predicted a goal glut before parking four buses and an oil tanker.\u201d I remember rushing home from work to watch that first leg. It reminded me of the film Human Traffic: the worse it got, the more determined I became to finish it. I was finally driven to a Twin Peaks VHS after about 70 minutes. 50 min Ito, whose movement is giving Robertson a few problems, wins a corner for Genk. Nothing comes of it, but they have picked up where they left off in the first half. Liverpool need to be careful. Red Bull Salzburg 1-1 Napoli was the half-time score in the other Group E game. You can check all the latest scores here. 47 min \u201cI have been watching the rugby World Cup - why does the review process work so well in rugby?\u201d writes US01. \u201cWhy can we not have the same level of professionalism and respect in football that we see from the excellent people who referee and play the rugby games?\u201d I don\u2019t know enough about rugby to comment, though I\u2019m sure the culture of accepting the referee\u2019s decision is one of the biggest reasons. 46 min Peep peep! Genk begin the second half. Ah, it seems Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain\u2019s goal took a slight deflection, which might explain why the keeper Gaetan Coucke was flat-footed. Half-time reading Half-time chit chat \u201cThe downside to getting rid of VAR is dealing with actual violent conduct,\u201d says Joe Harvey. \u201cIt was only four years ago when Deli All punched someone behind the ref\u2019s back. I wouldn\u2019t be too bothered with getting rid of it except in the case of Zidane-level stuff.\u201d The problem with that is that people would have a different view on what constitutes Zidane-level stuff. Peep peep! Sometimes, despite all the noise and nonsense, football is good, old-fashioned fun. That was a life-affirming - okay, gently uplifting - 45 minutes, with both sides playing with playground enthusiasm and intent. Liverpool deserve their lead, provided by Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain\u2019s early goal, but Genk have had chances and their captain Mbwana Samatta had an immense header ruled out for an offside in the build-up. 45 min Two minutes of added time. 44 min \u201cLiverpool really need to find a way to win away from home against limited opposition who play defensively,\u201d says Niall Mullen, lining up his punchline with tender loving care. \u201cBut enough about Sunday; how are they doing tonight?\u201d I\u2019d love to see Klopp\u2019s Liverpool v Houllier\u2019s Liverpool. 42 min Liverpool\u2019s Champions League group has been a whole heap of fun this season. 40 min Ito\u2019s brilliant low cross from the right just evades the stretching Samatta in the middle. The ball runs beyond Bongonda, who retrieves it and hits a shot that is blocked by Milner. I think Ito might have been offside, had they scored, but it was another exhilarating moment. Genk, and their Tanzanian captain Samatta in particular, have attacked with infectious intent. 39 min \u201cWhat strikes me as strange about VAR is this emphasis on a clear mistake by the ref,\u201d says Drew Gough. \u201cYou\u2019d reckon Liverpool might have had a penalty and that wasn\u2019t checked. Then the ref disallowed a goal for a shove that was overturned for an offside. Then you\u2019d have hoped VAR could have shown there was no contact on Keita and our poor ref might correctly have shown a yellow for the ol\u2019 simulation. But here we are, hey? To summarize, the trouble with all authoritarian surveillance systems is that technology tends to show that the people meant to be making smart decisions are a bunch of ding dongs but we persist with trusting in the correctness of their decisions.\u201d Problem is, if you review everything then matches will last four days. I would get rid of it, but that will never happen, so we might as well just grin and bear it. 36 min A quiet period in the game. 33 min Salah misses a great chance, heading wide from six yards after Lovren flicked on a right-wing corner. He mistimed the header completely. 31 min This is a very entertaining game. The indefatigable Robertson storms onto Mane\u2019s clever flick and hits a shot from a tight angle that is beaten away by Coucke. 31 min Salah curls a good free-kick just over the bar. We\u2019ve now seen a replay of the disallowed goal, and it was unquestionably the correct decision: Ito was marginally offside in the build-up. 30 min Keita dives to win a foul in a good position, 25 yards from goal and to the right of centre. 29 min \u201cBobbie dearest,\u201d says Mac Millings. \u201cLiverpool-supporting Regular Contributor, Matt Dony, should be pleased with things so far, but not as pleased as with the fact that he has an entire World XI inspired by his name: Andony Zubizarreta Dony Rose Wilfried Dony Doneil Lennon Fernando\u00f1yho Nordin Amramatt Shaun Mattdoney Matt Le Donier Malcolm Macdonyald Edson Arantes do Nyscimento Diego Maradony. NO GOAL! It was apparently disallowed for offside in the build-up rather than a foul. I hope that\u2019s the case, because it was a storming header and, although there was a bit of contact with Milner, football is a better game with headers like that. We haven\u2019t seen a replay of the offside yet. I\u2019ll level with you: I haven\u2019t a clue what\u2019s going on. Ach, that\u2019s a shame, and it was a glorious, emphatic header from Samatta at the far post. It\u2019s now being checked by VAR. NO GOAL! It\u2019s been disallowed by the on-field referee for a supposed foul on Milner at the far post. GOAL! Genk 1-1 Liverpool (Samatta 26) What a header! 25 min Coucke makes a vital block from Mane\u2019s close-range shot. The chance came after a delicious one-two with Firmino, who added yet another beauty to his highlights reel with a rabona reverse pass. He\u2019s all kinds of genius, that lad. 24 min Genk have been reasonably dangerous with their no-nonsense counter-attacks, and if they get the next goal this could become lively. If Liverpool get the next goal, we can all pack up and go home. 23 min Some news from the Press Association wires: Liverpool have condemned an \u201coffensive and inappropriate\u201d banner which was hung in the away end before the Champions League match in Genk. The banner, featuring a photoshopped picture of striker Divock Origi, was taken down as soon as the club were made aware of its existence. \u201cWe sought to have it removed as soon as we became aware,\u201d said a spokesman. \u201cThe banner is highly offensive and inappropriate. We condemn its use and we will look to identify those responsible for bringing it into the stadium.\u201d 22 min A Liverpool corner is fumbled by Coucke, who is relieved to see Mane\u2019s follow-up shot blocked by one of the many defenders on the six-yard line. 20 min Genk almost profit from another long ball. This time Ito runs at Lovren in the area, only to slip over at the moment of opportunity. 18 min Liverpool are much the better team, despite the occasional threat of Genk\u2019s front two. They look like a team who want to get qualification wrapped up before their final group game, away to Red Bull Salzburg. 15 min \u201cLiverpool may be playing right to left to you Rob,\u201d says Mark Grindrod, \u201cbut I prefer to view the MBM from the other side of the ground! \u2018For those of you watching in black and white, Tottenham are playing in yellow \u2026\u2019\u201d 12 min Genk are happy/have no option but to play on the break, launching long passes to the quick, muscular front pair of Samatta and Onuachu. I suspect Liverpool will face these tactics a lot away from home this season. 9 min \u201cI LOVED Bros,\u201d says Steve Waterhouse. \u201cWhat you gonna do about it?\u201d Probably nothin\u2019 at all. 8 min: Alisson makes a fine diving save from Onuachu! He looked well ffside as he ran onto another long ball from the back, and I suspect it would have been disallowed had he scored, but Alisson couldn\u2019t be sure of that and he made an outstanding reaction save low to his right. 7 min Liverpool appeal for a penalty when Firmino is eased over in the area. It probably was a foul, though I don\u2019t think it was clear enough for VAR to get involved. Jurgen Klopp does not concur. 5 min A chance out of nothing for Genk. A long ball out of defence puts Samatta clear of the defence, the wrong side of the last man Keita. He chests and then knees the ball into the area before cracking a left-footed shot well wide of the far post. Robertson did well to get back and ensure Samatta had to take the shot earlier than he would have liked. 3 min It wasn\u2019t the fiercest strike from Oxlade-Chamberlain, but it was well placed and might have sneaked in even if Coucke had dived. He is such a fine player, Oxlade-Chamberlain, and it\u2019s great to see him back. A perfect start for Liverpool. Fabinho played a nice little pass to find Oxlade-Chamberlain in a bit of space, 25 yards from goal. He got the ball out of his feet and drove a low shot that beat the unsighted, flat-footed Coucke and rolled into the far corner. That didn\u2019t take long. 1 min Keita redefines the backpass, twisting his body to guide the ball off his shoulder blade into the path of Robertson. Good lad. 1 min Peep peep! Liverpoo, in red, kick off from right to left. Genk are in blue. The players are ready for action. There\u2019s a pulsating atmosphere in the Luminus Arena. Pre-match reading \u201cTrivia question guess: (100% Google search free),\u201d says Peter Oh. \u201cBon Jovi, Livin\u2019 on a Prayer?\u201d I think that was 1987. Anyway, wrong! It was this popular record. Chelsea\u2019s spectacular form looks set to continue: Michy Bathsuayi has given them a late lead in Amsterdam. \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Peter Oh. \u201c\u201cRacing Genk was founded in 1988? I wouldn\u2019t really blame the travelling Liverpool supporters if they break into, \u2018You ain\u2019t got no history!\u2019\u201d Yep, 1st July 1988. A gold star for naming the No1 in the UK charts back then. Ajax v Chelsea The second half has just started in Amsterdam. You will believe the score! Mo Salah returns in what is a strong Liverpool starting line-up. James Milner is preferred to Joe Gomez at right-back. Genk (4-2-3-1) Coucke; Maehle, Cuesta, Lucumi, Uronen; Heynen, Berge; Ito, Samatta Bongonda; Onuachu. Substitutes: Vandevoordt, De Norre, Dewaest, Hrosovsky, Hagi, Ndongala. Liverpool (4-3-3) Alisson; Milner, Lovren, Van Dijk, Robertson; Oxlade-Chamberlain, Fabinho, Keita; Salah, Firmino, Mane. Substitutes: Adrian, Wijnaldum, Gomez, Henderson, Lallana, Brewster, Origi. Referee Slavko Vincic (Slovenia). Good evening. It\u2019s an odd thing to say about a team who are European champions and runaway leaders in England, but Liverpool kind of need to stop playing silly buggers. They have lost their last four group games away from home in Champions League, making qualification for the knockout stages \u2013 when they really come alive \u2013 tougher than it needs to be. They\u2019ll almost certainly be fine, because they\u2019re the best team in Europe right now, but they could do with a win in Belgium tonight to keep everything in order. Genk have not won in 14 attempts in the Champions League proper, going back to 2002, although they have drawn six of their seven games at home \u2013 including a worthy 0-0 against Napoli last month. Like Liverpool\u2019s last European opponents, Red Ball Salzburg, Genk provide a home for future stars. You could make quite a team out of those who have played for or come through the ranks here: Courtois, De Bruyne, Bailey, Koulibaly, Milinkovic-Savic, Ndidi and Liverpool\u2019s own Origi are all on the list. The current, very young side includes the prolific Tanzanian forward Mbwana Samatta and the classy Norwegian midfielder Sander Berge. They also signed Ianis Hagi - yep - from FC Viitorul Constanta in the summer. Genk were surprising but emphatic winners of last year\u2019s Belgian title, their fourth championship since the club was founded in 1988. And while their defence hasn\u2019t started too well, with four defeats in the first 10 games, that doesn\u2019t really matter tonight. They have the chance to beat the European champions, and become legends all over again. Kick off is at 8pm.",

The idea was raised at the defence select committee and is partly aimed at reducing the number of criminal proceedings that British army soldiers are involved in that relate to the 30-year period of violence and disorder in which 3,600 people died. At the hearing, the chairman, Julian Lewis, asked whether the government was considering adopting the \u201ctruth recovery process that was used so brilliantly by Nelson Mandela in South Africa\u201d in Northern Ireland. The Conservative backbench MP argued that was \u201cthe best way of getting at the truth and giving families some closure, whilst protecting people from prosecution for many years after the event\u201d. In reply, Lt Gen Richard Nugee, the chief of defence people, responsible for personnel issues in the military, said \u201cthat is exactly what we are looking at\u201d and added discussions were taking place between government departments. The initiative comes at a time when Conservative backbenchers are demanding that ministers take action to halt historical prosecutions of former soldiers who served in Northern Ireland, unless compelling new evidence emerges. There are also complaints that army veterans do not receive enough support when they are asked to give evidence at inquests relating to deaths in Northern Ireland.

A total of 13 people were killed. Tory backbenchers had hoped Boris Johnson would announce a bill in this month\u2019s Queen\u2019s speech to introduce a statutory presumption against prosecution for soldiers who served both in Northern Ireland and abroad, covering Afghanistan and Iraq. Such a bill did not appear, prompting another member of the committee, the Conservative Mark Francois, to complain that Wallace had allowed a \u201cSinn F\u00e9in/IRA veto\u201d over the scheme.

The 21-year-old has not found it easy since arriving from Borussia Dortmund in the summer. He has looked lost at times and his opportunities have been limited in recent weeks. He was left out altogether when Chelsea won in Lille this month and has not started a Premier League game since August.</p> <p>He also struggled during the last international break, failing to last the 90 minutes when the USA lost to Canada. Americans have watched on with concern.</p> <p>However Pulisic is working for a manager who wants every member of his squad to feel valued, to feel that they are part of the family, even when they are watching from the sidelines. This was a champion night for Lampard, who can do no wrong at the moment, and it was hugely satisfying for him to see two of his less-celebrated players click to seal a win which gives Chelsea a wonderful chance of reaching the last 16.</p> <p>Consider this a victory for coaching. Two months ago Lampard criticised Batshuayi\u2019s application, suggesting that the Belgian needed to work harder if he was to have any future at Chelsea. The message has hit home. Batshuayi has worked his way into Lampard\u2019s good books in recent weeks and he did not disappoint when the chance arrived to atone for the earlier miss, firing Pulisic\u2019s low cross in off the bar to stun Ajax, who came into the game top of Group H and the Eredivisie.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"33a946c84c0fb0ae21ccff845622fb933b907289\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33a946c84c0fb0ae21ccff845622fb933b907289/718_0_1912_1147/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pulisic (centre) celebrates with Michy Batshuayi (left) after the match.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pulisic (centre) celebrates with Michy Batshuayi (left) after the match.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Marsh/BPI/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was Pulisic who had seized the initiative for Chelsea when they needed a moment of class, running at Ajax on the left before dragging the ball into the area for Batshuayi to beat Andr\u00e9 Onana with an emphatic finish. With the USA coach, Gregg Berhalter, watching from the stands, Pulisic looked determined to leave a positive impression and this was a fine demonstration of why Chelsea paid so much money to sign him.</p> <p>Stepping into the void left by Eden Hazard\u2019s departure to Real Madrid has been daunting for Pulisic, a quiet and shy character, but there have been encouraging signs in recent weeks. He made Batshuayi\u2019s goal in the 4-1 win over Southampton this month and he did well after coming on in the victory against Newcastle on Saturday, playing an important role in Marcos Alonso\u2019s late winner.</p> <p>Pulisic\u2019s improvement is further demonstration of the progress Chelsea are making under Lampard, whose young side showed tremendous character in defeating one of last season\u2019s Champions League semi-finalists. There were four academy players in the Premier League side\u2019s starting 11 and nobody epitomised their courage more than Fikayo Tomori, who recovered from an early error to deliver an impeccable performance alongside Kurt Zouma in central defence.</p> <p>Admittedly Chelsea rode their luck at times, especially when Edson \u00c1lvarez headed against a post, but they have won six games in a row now and Lampard\u2019s youngsters showed plenty of technical prowess.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2019/oct/23/ajax-chelsea-champions-league-group-h-live\">Ajax 0-1 Chelsea: Champions League Group H \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tomori produced some fine interventions at the back, especially when he halted a winding run from Ziyech with a calm challenge. Mason Mount caught the eye with his clever touches in midfield. Hudson-Odoi\u2019s runs on the left were a constant threat, moreover, even if the 18-year-old\u2019s end-product left much to be desired.</p> <p>There were also fine performances from the old guard, with C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta a rock at right-back, but the spotlight would belong to Pulisic. He will hope this is just the start.</p>",

Callum Hudson-Odoi had undermined a bright display with his inability to provide a telling final pass, Tammy Abraham spent the evening crying out for better service and it was difficult not to feel that Frank Lampard\u2019s side would have to settle for a point when Michy Batshuayi, on as a substitute, fluffed his lines late on, blazing over when it seemed easier to score. The match would come to be defined as the moment when Pulisic\u2019s Chelsea career finally burst into life, though. The 21-year-old has not found it easy since arriving from Borussia Dortmund in the summer. He has looked lost at times and his opportunities have been limited in recent weeks. He was left out altogether when Chelsea won in Lille this month and has not started a Premier League game since August. He also struggled during the last international break, failing to last the 90 minutes when the USA lost to Canada. Americans have watched on with concern. However Pulisic is working for a manager who wants every member of his squad to feel valued, to feel that they are part of the family, even when they are watching from the sidelines. This was a champion night for Lampard, who can do no wrong at the moment, and it was hugely satisfying for him to see two of his less-celebrated players click to seal a win which gives Chelsea a wonderful chance of reaching the last 16. Consider this a victory for coaching. Two months ago Lampard criticised Batshuayi\u2019s application, suggesting that the Belgian needed to work harder if he was to have any future at Chelsea. The message has hit home. Batshuayi has worked his way into Lampard\u2019s good books in recent weeks and he did not disappoint when the chance arrived to atone for the earlier miss, firing Pulisic\u2019s low cross in off the bar to stun Ajax, who came into the game top of Group H and the Eredivisie. It was Pulisic who had seized the initiative for Chelsea when they needed a moment of class, running at Ajax on the left before dragging the ball into the area for Batshuayi to beat Andr\u00e9 Onana with an emphatic finish. With the USA coach, Gregg Berhalter, watching from the stands, Pulisic looked determined to leave a positive impression and this was a fine demonstration of why Chelsea paid so much money to sign him. Stepping into the void left by Eden Hazard\u2019s departure to Real Madrid has been daunting for Pulisic, a quiet and shy character, but there have been encouraging signs in recent weeks. He made Batshuayi\u2019s goal in the 4-1 win over Southampton this month and he did well after coming on in the victory against Newcastle on Saturday, playing an important role in Marcos Alonso\u2019s late winner. Pulisic\u2019s improvement is further demonstration of the progress Chelsea are making under Lampard, whose young side showed tremendous character in defeating one of last season\u2019s Champions League semi-finalists. There were four academy players in the Premier League side\u2019s starting 11 and nobody epitomised their courage more than Fikayo Tomori, who recovered from an early error to deliver an impeccable performance alongside Kurt Zouma in central defence. Admittedly Chelsea rode their luck at times, especially when Edson \u00c1lvarez headed against a post, but they have won six games in a row now and Lampard\u2019s youngsters showed plenty of technical prowess. Tomori produced some fine interventions at the back, especially when he halted a winding run from Ziyech with a calm challenge. Mason Mount caught the eye with his clever touches in midfield. Hudson-Odoi\u2019s runs on the left were a constant threat, moreover, even if the 18-year-old\u2019s end-product left much to be desired. There were also fine performances from the old guard, with C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta a rock at right-back, but the spotlight would belong to Pulisic. He will hope this is just the start.",

Top stories Angus Taylor baselessly accused Sydney\u2019s lord mayor of driving up carbon emissions by spending $15m on travel, a claim that was later backed up with a doctored council document provided to the Daily Telegraph, which reported the figure. City of Sydney\u2019s publicly available annual report shows councillors spent $1,727.77 on overseas travel and $4,206.32 on domestic travel. In total, the council spent $229,000 on travel during 2017-18 under its $300,000 budget. But the document provided to the Telegraph shows wildly different figures, which appeared in a strange format unlike the one used elsewhere in the annual report. It is unclear who altered the document and there is no suggestion that Taylor himself was responsible.

It would be better to go to voters having finished the job.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson\u2019s cabinet is divided over how to proceed with Brexit, as the prime minister faces the stark choice of pressing ahead with his deal or gambling his premiership on a pre-Christmas general election. After an inconclusive meeting with Jeremy Corbyn on Wednesday morning in an attempt to agree an acceptable timetable for parliament to consider the bill, the prime minister told MPs at Wednesday\u2019s PMQs that he was awaiting the decision of the EU27 over whether to grant an extension before settling his next move. The EU\u2019s decision is unlikely to come before Friday. Some cabinet ministers, including the Northern Ireland secretary, Julian Smith, are cautious about asking for an election. They believe the majority of 30 achieved by the government on the second reading of the Brexit bill on Tuesday suggests Johnson\u2019s deal has enough support to carry it through all its stages in parliament. Smith, who was Theresa May\u2019s chief whip, has examined the various amendments to the withdrawal agreement bill, and does not believe any of them would necessitate pulling it. \u201cJulian\u2019s view is that the numbers are there,\u201d said an ally. Some Tory MPs said there also were serious misgivings on the back benches about the idea of an immediate election. \u201cThere\u2019s a big, big fight going on, basically,\u201d one said. \u201cThe parliamentary party is split 50/50. Personally, I don\u2019t think an election is a very good idea.\u201d Another said: \u201cI\u2019d rather we focused more on passing the bill. It would be better to go to voters having finished the job. I feel that\u2019s what most colleagues want.\u201d However, hard Brexit supporters appear to be more gung-ho, with leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg fearing support for the bill could yet fall away \u2013 if the 19 Labour rebels who backed it fail to secure the amendments they would like to see, for example. Members of the Eurosceptic European Research Group (ERG) are also nervous about the legislation being amended in a way that they would find unacceptable \u2013 such as obliging the government to seek a customs union. After Johnson\u2019s meeting with Corbyn on Wednesday, Downing Street briefed that Corbyn had \u201cmade clear Labour have no policy except more delays\u201d and hinted heavily that Johnson\u2019s next move would be to ask MPs to support a December election. \u201cAny time that parliament gets a vote for delay, it will always choose delay,\u201d said a Downing Street source. \u201cTherefore, if this parliament is unwilling to vote for a deal, we will have to go for a general election.\u201d Despite the bullish rhetoric, Johnson\u2019s chief whip, Mark Spencer, later met his Labour counterpart, Nick Brown, to explore whether a new timetable could be agreed for scrutinising the bill. That suggested the idea of trying to pilot the bill through parliament had not been ditched altogether \u2013 particularly if only a short extension is granted. In the meeting between the two party leaders, held in the same Westminster office where Corbyn had previously confronted May, Dominic Cummings suggested MPs should be prepared to sit all night to hit next week\u2019s Halloween deadline, according to one witness. Meanwhile, Johnson has been trying to persuade EU leaders not to grant an extension \u2013 or at least to keep it short. The PM spoke to Donald Tusk on Wednesday morning, telling the European council\u2019s president, who has called for EU leaders to allow a further Brexit extension, that he does not personally want a delay. He also discussed the issue with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. Johnson\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cThe PM was clear in restating his position that he does not believe that any delay beyond 31 October is in the interests of the UK or the EU and that we need to get the deal through parliament before that point.\u201d The prime minister was forced to write to the EU on Saturday to seek a delay until 31 January under a backbench-instigated law averting no deal, but had hoped to rush the bill putting his plan into law through parliament this week, to meet the current 31 October deadline. Corbyn used all his questions at PMQs to ask Johnson about elements of the bill, including standards for environmental, consumer and workers\u2019 rights, and the continued inclusion of Northern Ireland in elements of the EU\u2019s customs union. After Johnson incorrectly said there would be \u201cno checks between Northern Ireland and GB [Great Britain]\u201d, Corbyn accused him of having not properly read his own bill. \u201cThe prime minister unlawfully prorogued parliament; he said he would refuse to comply with [the] law; he threw Northern Ireland under a bus; he ripped up protections for workers\u2019 rights and environmental protections; lost every vote along the way; and tried to prevent genuine, democratic scrutiny and debate,\u201d the Labour leader said. \u201cEven worse than that, he\u2019s not that familiar with it.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Jacob Steinberg on Christian Pulisic ... https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/oct/23/chelsea-christian-pulisic-frank-lampard-ajax-champions-league David Hytner was at the Johan Cruyff Arena for the Guardian. Here\u2019s how he saw an entertaining game unfold. Frank Lampard speaks: \u201cI\u2019m so happy.,\u201d he tells BT Sport. \u201cTo come here, I knew how tough this game would be \u2013 they\u2019re a really strong side. To play and beat them - and we deserved to beat them \u2013 is so satisfying. I was so, so proud of the performance.\u201d He goes on to praisde various players, including his substitutes - those who got a game and some who didn\u2019t. \u201cI think we deserved our luck today,\u201d he says of the VAR decision. \u201cYou make your luck on that one and the one that hit the post.\u201d Chelsea worth their win? I think so, on balance. It was a game of ebb and flow which could have gone either way, but ultimately Chelsea had that little bit of finesse in the final third, which helped separate the men from the boys. You may not read or hear much about this in the match coverage of assorted media outlets, but Frank Lampard fielded quite a few young players tonight. It\u2019s a policy of his that\u2019s being kept very low key ... Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeep! It\u2019s all over in Amsterdam, where Chelsea have taken three points courtesy of a second half winner from the substitute Michy Batshuayi. 90+4 min: It\u2019s all going Pete Tong for Ajax, who finally get theb all into the Chelsea half, only to concede a free-kick which their visitors are in no big rush to take. 90+3 min: Chelsea, playing most of their football in the Ajax right-back position, win another free-kick and play the ball towards the corner. 90+2 min: Pulisic loses the ball in the corner and it\u2019s hacked downfield by Ajax. Jorginho is on hand to deal with it and play it forward again. 90+1 min: We enter added time and Chelsea have the ball deep in Ajax territory. Batshuayi smashes a shot towards Onana, who is unable to hold it and concedes a corner. Unsurprisingly, Chelsea opt to play it short. They win another corner, Christian Pulisic doing the honours. 90 min: Chelsea substitution: Reece James on for Callum Hudson-Odoi. 87 min: Ajax double substitution: Klaus Jan-Huntelaar and Siem De Jong on for Joel Veltman and Edson Alvarez. Chelsea lead! Christian Pulisic provides the pull-back from the left and the ball squirms through to Batshuayi . He digs it out from under his feet and scores with a shot that goes in off the underside of the cross-bar. 83 min: Azpilicueta finds himself in space on the left flank and tries to send a cross into the Ajax penalty area. It\u2019s a poor effort that Tagliafico blocks easily. Ajax gallop up the field in a two-on-two counter-attack, which Jorginho puts a stop to with some excellent defending. 82 min: Pulisic has looked lively since coming on and goes close with a low drive from distance. It\u2019s wide of the left upright, but not by a great deal. 80 min: Zouma appeals for handball and a penalty after jumping alongside Tagliafico to contest a high ball. Replays show the Argentinian had no case to answer. 77 min: Pulisic tries to tee up Hudson-Odoi in the Ajax penalty area, but Edson Alvarez lunges in with a potentially goal-saving tackle before the Chelsea youngster can pull the trigger. A corner for Chelsea, from which nothing comes. 76 min: Ajax break up the field on the counter-attack, but the move breaks down on the back of a wayward pass from Martinez to Neres. 75 min: Ajax substitution: Quincy Promes off, David Neres on. 73 min: Michy Batshuayi misses an absolute sitter after being teed up by a deflected shot from Pulisic that looped up in the air and could scarcely have fallen more kindly for him. He\u2019s seven yards from goal with only the goalkeeper to beat, the ball drops beautifully and he somehow contrives to balloon his effort over the bar. Oh Michy, as Tony Basil famously sang. 71 min: Hakim Ziyech and Donny van de Beek combine down the right, but the latter loses the ball in a rare show of sloppiness. 70 min: Chelsea substitution: Michi Batshuayi on, Tammy Abraham off. 69 min: Tadic trips Zouma deep inside Chelsea territory and Kepa takes the free-kick ... eventually, to the soundtrack of jeers from the Ajax fans. It\u2019s getting a bit scrappy now. 67 min: Chelsea substitution: Christian Pulisic on, Willian off. 66 min: An accidental finger in the eye, I hasten to add. He caught the Brazilian with a stray arm as he tried to get away 65 min: Now Lisandro Martinez gets cautioned after catching Jorginho with a finger in the eye as he tried to get away from the Chelsea midfielder. 64 min: Callum Hudson-Odoi gets booked for a tug on the shirt of Tadic, who had just robbed him of possession. 61 min: Azpilicueta gallops forward and plays the ball wide to Willian near the right touchline. His cross is cut out and cleared by Joel Veltman. 60 min: Ajax corner, which Donny van der Beek delivers to perfection. Edson Alvarez hits the post with a diving header at the near post, that fizzes across the face of gal and hits the far one. So close. 56 min: Ten minutes into the second half and Chelsea appear to have grown in confidence. There\u2019s still not much in it, mind. It\u2019s an entertaining, evenly matched game with both teams lacking that little bit of finesse in the final third. 53 min: Martinez plays the ball wide to the excellent5 Ziyech near the corner flag. He directs a cross towards Promes in the Chelsea penalty area, but the visitors clear. 51 min: Mount wins a corner after an attempted cross towards Abraham and Hudson-Odoi is intercepted. The ball\u2019s played in towards Alonso, but Lisandro puts it out for another corner. Nothing comes of it. 49 min: Chelsea attack, with Alonso on the ball down the left flank. The ball\u2019s played inside to Mason Mount, who attempts to shoot from distance. Daley Blind blocks. 48 min: Dusan Tadic is booked for a clash with Willian, who he caught with an accidental clothesline. There\u2019s a break in play so the Chelsea player can receive treatment. 46 min: Play resumes for the second half and Ajax win two corners in quick succession. Quincy Promes takes the second one short to Ziyech, who plays it back to the striker. He crosses the ball into the Chelsea penalty area, from where it\u2019s cleared. Peep! It\u2019s all square at the break in an absorbing, entertaining game. Ajax thought they\u2019d scored through Quincy Promes, only to have their goal ruled out in a VAR review. The Ajax striker was offside by the most slender of margins. Chelsea have had chances of their own in a match that could still go either way. 45 min: Now Hakim Ziyech tries his luck from distance, but his effort is also high, wide and handsome. 43 min: Azpilicueta tries a hopelessly optimistic shot that sails high and wide. 39 min: Cesar Azpilicueta slides in with a perfectly timed tackle to prevent Quincy Promes from firing off a shot from close range in the Chelsea penalty area. After a wonderfully neat passing move, Van De Beek picked out the striker with a pass towards the far post but Alonso did wonderfully. It remains scoreless, after Promes\u2019s is found to have been a toenail offside before he slid in with a leg outstretched to poke home the delivery from Ziyech. It remains all square. Promes scores! Ajax take the lead courtesy of Quincy Promes, who slides in at the far post to prod home a cross from the right. But it\u2019s going to VAR! 31 min: It\u2019s fairly evenly matched a third of the way into the game. Both teams have had reasonable chances without anything too clear cut. Donny van der Beek looks a terrific player, much like he did throughout most of last season\u2019s Champions League campaign. 26 min: Mason Mount on the ball, down by the corner flag. He plays it short to Alonso, who sends in a cross from the touchline. Ziyech\u2019s feeble defensive header strays into the path of Callum Hudson-Odoi, who shoots wide from a good scoring position. 25 min: Callum Hudson-Odoi drives into the box from the inside left channel before curling a shot well wide. 23 min: There\u2019s a brief break in play so the referee can walk to the touchline and brandish a yellow card in the direction of Frank Lampard\u2019s assistant, Jody Morris. I suspect he\u2019s been badgering the fourth official, who has tired of the aural assault. 21 min: Daley Blind wellies the ball long towards Quincy Promes after a Chelsea counter-attack, started when Tammy Abraham picked Lisandro Martinez\u2019s pocket in midfield, is thwarted. Fikayo Tomori is able to judge the bounce and clear under pressure. 19 min: Hakim Ziyech gets on the ball through the centre and plays a nice pass out to Quincy Promes on left flank. He moves it forward and sends in a cross, which Ziyech is on hand to collect at the far post. He attempts to drill the ball back across the face of goal, but his effort is blocked. 17 min: Chelsea win a throw-in deep in their own half. Marcos Alonso steals a cheeky 10 metres before chucking the ball back into play. 15 min: Good play from Mount, who brings a smart save out of Ajax goalkeeper Andre Onana at the near post. Chelsea have a corner. Callum Hudson-Odoi swings the ball into the mixer, Marcos Alonso gets a flick and the ball is skimmed wide. 12 min: Willian fouls Nicolas Tagliafico near the halfway line and Ajax win themselves another free-kick. They\u2019re having the better of things in these early stages, but there\u2019s not much between the two sides. 10 min: Ajax win a corner, which is arrowed into space at the far post. Donny van de Beek peels away from his man into space and catches the dropping ball with a sweet, sweet volley. Kurt Zouma blocks his fine effort. 9 min: Ajax central defender Joel Veltman tries a shot from distance. His low drive is pulled wide of the right upright. 7 min: Ajax attack down the left touchline, before Quincy Promes misplaces a pass aimed for Donny van de Beek into the Chelsea penalty area. Chelsea attempt to clear, but Fikayo Timori gives the ball away. 6 min: Tammy Abraham is penalised for a late challenge on Joel Veltman, conceding a free-kick inside the Ajax half. 4 min: Crikey! It\u2019s a lively start. Chelsea win another corner and it\u2019s taken on the right-hand side by Willian. Fikayo Timori gets a free header, but is unable to steer his effort on goal. 3 min: Ajax gallop up field on the counter after Fikayo Timori gives the ball away in midfield, with Donny van de Beek on the ball. He plays a one-two with Quincy Promes, kicks the ball against the arm of Marcos Alonso in the Chelsea penalty area and appeals for a spot-kick. On the touchline the linesman raises his flag and it\u2019s ... offside. 2 min: Callum Hudson-Odoi plays the corner deep towards the far post, aiming for Kurt Zouma. Ajax goalkeeper is quick to punch clear. 1 min: Ajax get the ball rolling, their players wearing red and white shirts, white shorts and white socks. The players of Chelsea wear black shirts with orange trim, black shorts and black socks. Chelsea press high and win an early corner courtesy of Jorginho. Not long now: The teams are out and lined up either side of the match officials for the Champions League anthem. We\u2019re just a coin-toss and some ineffectual-but-compulsory posing for photos with cardboard anti-racism #slogans away from kick-off. That stat has made me feel very old: Josh McEachran currently plays for Birmingham City, in case you\u2019re wondering. He made his first appearance of the season in yesterday evening\u2019s 1-0 win over Blackburn Rovers. He has previously claimed in a BBC Radio 5 Live interview that claims he lost his confidence after being bounced around a series of Championship club \u2013 Swansea City, Middlesbrough, Watford, Wigan \u2013 on loan, before leaving Chelsea for Brentford, where his progress was halted by injury. Ajax: Onana, Dest, Veltman, Blind, Tagliafico, Alvarez, Martinez, Ziyech, van de Beek, Promes, Tadic. Subs: Bruno Varela, Schuurs, Neres, Huntelaar, Mazraoui, De Jong, Marin. Chelsea: Arrizabalaga, Azpilicueta, Tomori, Zouma, Alonso, Jorginho, Kovacic, Hudson-Odoi, Mount, Willian, Abraham. Subs: Caballero, Giroud, Pulisic, Batshuayi, James, Emerson Palmieri, Gilmour. Referee: Ovidiu Alin Hategan (Romania) Frank Lampard speaks: \u201cWe have confidence in ourselves, but it\u2019s a tough match,\u201d said Chelsea\u2019s manager, when asked if he and his team have confidence in themselves and if he thought it would be a tough match. \u201cI watched them play last year and I know their team has changed slightly. I\u2019m very aware of the new threats they have. They\u2019ve won their two Champions League games convincingly.\u201d And on his thoughts and dreams? \u201cWe expect a really tough match against a team that performed last year and have won both games in this group comfortably. It\u2019s going to be a tough match, I don\u2019t think the five wins [in a row Chelsea are on] mean anything other than that hopefully we have some confidence. But this will be a completely different challenge which we obviously need to be ready for.\u201d Erik ten Hag speaks: \u201cAjax is no favourite when we play against a Premier League club,\u201d said the home manager, possibly upon being told his team are the bookie\u2019s favourites to win tonight. \u201cBut we are going for the win, that is always our intention. We want to play our own game to our own strengths. \u201cIn top competitions you have to be prepared to battle. But a sensible approach is always better. We have to be very good on the ball and not try to match their pace. We must be patient on the ball and choose the right moments to go deep.\u201d Stirring stuff. Ross Barkley misses out after injuring his ankle in Chelsea\u2019s win over Newcastle on Saturday, while N\u2019Golo Kante will also sit this one out after injuring his groin while on international duty with France. Andreas Christensen (hamstring) and Antonio Rudiger (groin) have also been left at home. Nicolas Tagliafico makes a welcome return to the Ajax ranks after missing out on their laboured Eredivisie victory over bottom-dwellers RKC Waalwijk at the weekend through suspension. His inclusion means Erik ten Hag is in the enviable position of having a fully fit squad to choose from. The Amsterdam Arena is the venue for what could be a fascinating encounter between last year\u2019s semi-finalists and the reigning Europa League champions. Erik ten Hag\u2019s men sit top of the group with two wins from two, while Frank Lampard\u2019s side have won one of their two games and sit level on points with Valencia. Lille currently sit bottom of the group with what our friends in France might describe as nul points. Kick-off tonight is at 5.55pm (BST), but stay tuned in the meantime for team news and build-up.",

      "body": "<p>Ask the residents of the Ribble Valley whether they would swap their rural lives for a busy city one, and the answer is straightforward: \u201cDefinitely not. The thought of it horrifies me,\u201d said Jonathan Gledhill, the landlord of the Red Pump Inn, a village dining pub in this quiet part of mid-Lancashire.</p> <p>Just north of the former mill towns of south Lancashire, this green and pleasant part of the north-west \u2013 which includes the vast and unspoilt Forest of Bowland \u2013 is officially the happiest place in the UK, according to the <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/wellbeing/bulletins/measuringnationalwellbeing/april2018tomarch2019\">Office for National Statistics</a>. On a scale of 0 to 10, Ribble Valley residents scored an average of 8.30 when asked by government surveyors about how happy they felt. This compared with an average of 7.56 for the country at large.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not surprising. People here derive a great pleasure from living their lives, as opposed to gathering material possessions. They might have bit of money and a nice house, but they\u2019re not on a city centre treadmill,\u201d said Gledhill, who moved to the tiny parish of Bashall Eaves five years ago with his wife, Fran, to run the Red Pump.</p> <p>The quiet lanes of the Ribble Valley \u2013 with the old market town of Clitheroe at its heart - may seem far from city stresses, but here a rural life for city workers is within easy reach. Manchester is only a short train ride away, while the west coast mainline and motorway networks snake around the Trough of Bowland to bring in piles of visitors, supporting an economy shifting away from agriculture to tourism.</p> <p>Once best known for its small Norman castle and countryside surrounds, Clitheroe and the Ribble Valley has developed a reputation as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/feb/05/clitheroe-lancashire-uk-top-50-gastropubs\">gastronomic hotspot</a> in recent years, with a cluster of award-winning inns. It attracts clientele from across the north and further afield, and won welcome exposure when Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon visited the Inn at Whitewell for their TV series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2010/nov/27/the-trip-northern-england-restaurants\">The Trip</a>.</p> <p>\u201cPeople don\u2019t realise how accessible it is,\u201d said Steven Smith, the chef-proprietor of the award-winning Freemasons at Wiswell, who frequently visits London on business via a two-hour train ride from Preston.</p> <p>\u201cMy customers work in Manchester, London and so forth. Here you can get that little step out and that \u2018breathe\u2019 factor. Its beautiful, but not a million miles from anywhere,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6cc39b802ab8876e1c931356ed4402ea11c36f65\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6cc39b802ab8876e1c931356ed4402ea11c36f65/0_0_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chef proprietor Steven Smith of the Freemasons at Wiswell.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chef proprietor Steven Smith of the Freemasons at Wiswell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Calton/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The former head of the Professional Footballers Association Gordon Taylor, who plied his trade as a winger at nearby Bolton Wanderers, lives in the quiet village. Smith said executives from firms across the north-west called the area home \u2013 including those from BAE Systems, one of the biggest employers in the county, with several factories near Preston.</p> <p>Earnings are above average, and people are more likely to be homeowners.

      "bodyText": "Ask the residents of the Ribble Valley whether they would swap their rural lives for a busy city one, and the answer is straightforward: \u201cDefinitely not. The thought of it horrifies me,\u201d said Jonathan Gledhill, the landlord of the Red Pump Inn, a village dining pub in this quiet part of mid-Lancashire. Just north of the former mill towns of south Lancashire, this green and pleasant part of the north-west \u2013 which includes the vast and unspoilt Forest of Bowland \u2013 is officially the happiest place in the UK, according to the Office for National Statistics. On a scale of 0 to 10, Ribble Valley residents scored an average of 8.30 when asked by government surveyors about how happy they felt. This compared with an average of 7.56 for the country at large. \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising. People here derive a great pleasure from living their lives, as opposed to gathering material possessions. They might have bit of money and a nice house, but they\u2019re not on a city centre treadmill,\u201d said Gledhill, who moved to the tiny parish of Bashall Eaves five years ago with his wife, Fran, to run the Red Pump. The quiet lanes of the Ribble Valley \u2013 with the old market town of Clitheroe at its heart - may seem far from city stresses, but here a rural life for city workers is within easy reach. Manchester is only a short train ride away, while the west coast mainline and motorway networks snake around the Trough of Bowland to bring in piles of visitors, supporting an economy shifting away from agriculture to tourism. Once best known for its small Norman castle and countryside surrounds, Clitheroe and the Ribble Valley has developed a reputation as a gastronomic hotspot in recent years, with a cluster of award-winning inns. It attracts clientele from across the north and further afield, and won welcome exposure when Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon visited the Inn at Whitewell for their TV series The Trip. \u201cPeople don\u2019t realise how accessible it is,\u201d said Steven Smith, the chef-proprietor of the award-winning Freemasons at Wiswell, who frequently visits London on business via a two-hour train ride from Preston. \u201cMy customers work in Manchester, London and so forth. Here you can get that little step out and that \u2018breathe\u2019 factor. Its beautiful, but not a million miles from anywhere,\u201d he said. The former head of the Professional Footballers Association Gordon Taylor, who plied his trade as a winger at nearby Bolton Wanderers, lives in the quiet village. Smith said executives from firms across the north-west called the area home \u2013 including those from BAE Systems, one of the biggest employers in the county, with several factories near Preston. Earnings are above average, and people are more likely to be homeowners. Ribble Valley has among the top rates of owner occupation in Lancashire, ranking well ahead of towns such as Blackburn, Burnley and Preston. Young people, however, can find it hard to get on the housing ladder, while cuts to the public bus services have made life harder for those without transport. Residents number about 60,000, and are widely dispersed and rapidly ageing. About a quarter of the population are over 65, above the national average of about 18%, in an area popular with retirees from across the country. But Rachel McQueen, chief executive of Marketing Lancashire, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a place where families enjoy a great work-life balance, an active outdoor life in commutable distance to work, good schools and some of the country\u2019s finest universities, so we\u2019re not surprised that residents of Lancashire\u2019s Ribble Valley are amongst the happiest in the UK.\u201d Against a backdrop of immense political stress and uncertainty, Britain as a whole has got steadily happier in the six years since the government\u2019s statisticians began to assess the wellbeing of the nation, but the north-west has recorded the largest improvement. The surveys show that money and power aren\u2019t everything. London boroughs, such as Islington and Camden, are on paper among the most prosperous places in the country, with wages well above average. But their residents are consistently less happy than the national average.

Trump\u2019s efforts to press Ukraine for an investigation of the Bidens are now the subject of a House impeachment inquiry.

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn is facing significant pressure from his own MPs to resist any government calls for an immediate general election, as Labour refused to confirm when they might back such a poll even if a lengthy Brexit extension is agreed. While the official Labour position remains that Corbyn will support an election once the immediate threat of a no-deal Brexit no longer exists, the party leadership is refusing to be pinned down on what reassurances would be needed for this to happen. The deliberate ambiguity is partly caused by extreme anxiety among Labour MPs about the prospect of abandoning the idea of a Brexit referendum for a pre-Christmas election, especially with the party a dozen or so percentage points behind the Conservatives in recent polls. One Labour backbencher told the Guardian they believed up to half the parliamentary party could rebel if Corbyn decided to whip his MPs to support a motion seeking an election under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act (FTPA). Another MP described the opposition to an election within Labour as \u201cvery strong and widespread\u201d. A party source added: \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say there\u2019s not a great appetite for an election in December.\u201d Under the FTPA, which came into force in 2011, if a government wants to force a general election sooner than the standard five-year cycle it must pass a motion with a two-thirds majority in the House of Commons, or at least 430 votes. Boris Johnson has twice called such a vote to seek an election, but failed to attract the necessary number of votes after Labour abstained. One ardently pro-remain Labour MP said some colleagues believe a general election may be the party\u2019s last, best hope of blocking Brexit, and he was \u201ctotally split\u201d about whether to support it. Another warned: \u201cI think only a very small fraction would vote for it.\u201d At the shadow cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Corbyn loyalists including Dan Carden and Laura Pidcock spoke out in favour of supporting an early poll \u2013 but others would prefer to push for a referendum. Corbyn\u2019s spokesman, giving a briefing to reporters after prime minister\u2019s questions on Wednesday, repeated that the party\u2019s policy remained backing an election once no-deal was prevented, but repeatedly refused to say whether this would happen if the EU agreed a Brexit delay until 31 January. \u201cExactly how the extension is made, and how it\u2019s communicated and what the legal status is, will determine whether we consider [no deal] taken off the table, and the risk of a crash-out there or not,\u201d he said. \u201cAs soon as the threat of a no-deal crash-out is off the table, and that is clear and guaranteed, then of course we would support an election.\u201d The spokesman declined to say what further guarantees would be sought on preventing no deal, saying only: \u201cWe need to wait and see what it is that they\u2019re going to come up with, which I think is going to be quite soon.\u201d Asked if the concern would be the fact that under law, if Labour supported an election motion under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act then it would be up to the government to set a poll date, the spokesman said this was \u201cone of the worries\u201d, but not the only one. If Corbyn did decide to support an election, it would seem unlikely that a backbench Labour rebellion could prevent this. If Conservatives in the Commons were joined by the SNP and Liberal Democrats, both of whom have liaised with Labour over whether to back an election, it would need little more than a third of Labour MPs to back the plan for it to reach 430 votes. Additionally, Labour whips would try to suppress any rebellion by impressing on MPs the need to show the party as united before an election. The timing of any election hinges in part on whether Johnson pushes for an immediate poll or tries instead to again shepherd his Brexit-enabling withdrawal agreement bill through the Commons after MPs rejected the accelerated timetable on Tuesday. At a meeting between Corbyn and Johnson on Wednesday, called to discuss a possible revised parliamentary timetable, Dominic Cummings, the PM\u2019s chief of staff, appeared keenest on pushing Brexit through parliament in time to hit the 31 October deadline \u2013 even if it meant holding all-night sittings. The meeting was good-natured but inconclusive, according to one person present, who claimed the No 10 side had kicked off by asking how Labour might respond if a Brexit extension was vetoed by France. While Theresa May and her advisers faced Corbyn across the table in her Westminster office, Johnson, who has inherited the room, chose to conduct the conversation on sofas. While the talks were described as \u201ccordial\u201d, it quickly became clear that there was no common ground at all over Labour\u2019s idea of a longer timetable for the Brexit bill. Asked if the process would resume, a Downing Street source said: \u201cI do not expect any further talks.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The England and Wales Cricket Board has insisted the Hundred will be judged a success only if it \u201cgrows the game as a whole\u201d after the controversial new cricket format came under sustained scrutiny from MPs. Executives from cricket\u2019s governing body, including the chairman, Colin Graves, and the chief executive, Tom Harrison, were in Westminster to give evidence to the digital, culture, media and sport select committee. The subject of inquiry was \u201cthe future of English cricket\u201d and, flanked by two World Cup trophies, the most senior figures in the game laid out their plans for what Clare Connor, managing director of women\u2019s cricket, called \u201cthe biggest opportunity ever, for both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s games\u201d. At the top of the list is the Hundred, a new format which will be played by eight city-based teams over the course of six weeks next summer. Some games will be shown on the BBC, marking live cricket\u2019s return to terrestrial TV after a 15-year absence. But the competition has been accused of sucking attention and resources from other parts of the game and with opponents \u2013 complete with Stop the Hundred T-shirts \u2013 sitting in on proceedings, there was no avoiding the topic. Asked by the Conservative MP Julian Knight about the \u201cextraordinary\u201d controversy over the format, Harrison said the Hundred \u201cis about growing the game and protecting things we value the most\u201d and cited as proof the 50-over World Cup this summer. \u201cWe\u2019ve just seen grounds across country packed full of fans,\u201d he said. \u201cForty per cent of those were first-time buyers. The vibrancy, colour, noise and energy from those matches will live with all of us. The Hundred is an attempt to replicate some of that and bring it back every year. It\u2019s not to take away from the counties but to make sure we use every advantage to grow the game. \u201cResearch shows we have 1.5 million who regularly watch cricket but over 10 million who like the sport. We have to bridge that gap, to reach out to children and families. We want every community to say \u201cit\u2019s a game for me\u201d. To that end we\u2019ve deliberately put teams in large conurbations with different target markets. \u201cWe hope county cricket fans turn up in their droves. We do not want to cannibalise T20 in any way. We will benchmark the Hundred\u2019s success on whether it grows the game. Within four or five years cricket has to show it has the ability to grow.\u201d Asked why the ECB had not simply rethought its offering in Twenty20, the shorter form of the game that was first devised in England and has become a global sensation thanks to the Indian Premier League, Graves said: \u201cThe new tournament brought TV back to the table. If we had stuck with T20, terrestrial would not have been there. T20 works for a market. We believe there is a market there for a new tournament.\u201d Graves claimed there were \u201cat least\u201d four other countries looking at implementing the Hundred, if it proves a success. The involvement of terrestrial TV (alongside Sky, which will show the majority of the Hundred matches live) has been a central selling point of the Hundred. It was also a source of some wry amusement to the committee who noted the decline in cricket participation that followed the departure of live cricket to pay TV in 2005, following England\u2019s spectacular Ashes triumph. The Labour MP Ian Lucas asked about the decision, ending his question with the entreaty, \u201cplease don\u2019t do it again\u201d. Graves, who was chairman of Yorkshire Cricket Club in 2005, said the ECB had \u201cat that time possibly missed one or two tricks\u201d but claimed the organisation was now in the process of \u201csquaring the circle\u201d. One positive structural change this time has been the creation of professional cricket in England for women and the Hundred will be the first sporting competition to have men\u2019s and women\u2019s tournaments from the outset. \u201cOur plan for the women\u2019s game in the next five years will see \u00a350m invested,\u201d Connor said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking to increase representation in playing, coaching and other workforce roles. There will be three times as many professionals. Ten years ago you couldn\u2019t earn a living as a female playing the sport, now you can. We should all celebrate that.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "California\u2019s largest utility has begun widespread blackouts affecting nearly half a million people as dangerous fire weather returned to the state. The Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Company said on Wednesday the shutoffs would begin around 2pm in the Sierra foothills, followed soon after by blackouts north of the San Francisco Bay Area. In all, the power will be cut to portions of 17 counties. The outages will last about 48 hours, the utility said. The Santa Rosa fire department tweeted that shutoffs had started in the city and it was getting multiple reports of outages. Meanwhile, Southern California Edison said it could cut power on Thursday to more than 308,000 customers in seven counties and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric is warning of power shutoffs to about 24,000 customers. The utilities said they were concerned that winds forecast to top 60mph (97km/h) could throw branches and debris into power lines or topple them, sparking wildfires. PG&amp;E cut power to more than 2 million people across California in rolling blackouts earlier this month, the largest deliberate blackout to prevent wildfires in state history. The shutoffs caused schools to close and many businesses to shutter. Residents complained PG&amp;E communicated late and ineffectively, even failing to keep its website running smoothly during the outages. The utility \u2013 the largest in the United States - declared bankruptcy in January, in part because of potential liabilities from its role in some of the 2017 northern California fires and the 2018 Camp fire. Experts and authorities are warning that shutoffs may be the new normal in the state amid a deepening climate crisis. \u201cThere were bad fires in the 20th century, but more or less, there was a power system that worked,\u201d Michael Wara, the director of the Climate and Energy Policy program at Stanford University, told the Guardian last month. \u201cI think what\u2019s different is the weather extremes are much more extreme and that\u2019s a predictable effect of climate change.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s not panic per se, just, \u2018Eh, we gotta do this again?\u2019\u201d said Kim Schefer, the manager of Village True Value Hardware in Santa Rosa. Schefer directed customers to gas cans and batteries as they prepared for what many see as a costly, frustrating new routine. The California governor, Gavin Newsom, sent a sharply worded letter on Tuesday to Bill Johnson, PG&amp;E CEO, blaming the unprecedented mass outage earlier this month on the company\u2019s failure to maintain and upgrade its equipment. State rules leave utilities to control when they will shut down the power, and how they will choose to do it. PG&amp;E says the shutdowns are not about money. The only goal \u201cis to prevent a catastrophic wildfire\u201d, Johnson said in a Tuesday briefing.",

      "body": "<p>Tis the season to be canvassing. The odds on the first December election for nearly a century have dramatically shortened. With Boris Johnson\u2019s commitment to Brexit happening by 31 October now dead in a ditch, the Vote Leave faction of his administration is pushing hard for the \u201cparliament versus the people\u201d contest they have always craved. The political calculations now made by Labour will prove critical to the prospects of the embattled Corbyn project.</p> \n<p>It was a strategic blunder for Labour and other opposition parties not to accept the election gauntlet when it was first thrown down <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/04/you-great-big-girls-blouse-boris-johnson-appears-to-insult-corbyn-during-pmqs\" title=\"\">in September</a>. There were two reasons: the first was a genuine fear that no deal could be engineered mid-campaign. This was not baseless paranoia: the Johnson administration had proved itself to be devoid of trustworthiness, and the prime minister\u2019s special adviser, Dominic Cummings, had fed the prospect to the media. The second was driven by those who believed a pre-election people\u2019s vote was possible, potentially facilitated by a so-called government of national unity.</p> \n<p>But as one Labour source put it to me, the mistake everyone made was to presume that Johnson would not strike a deal with the EU. It wasn\u2019t his political ingenuity that was underestimated, but rather his willingness to capitulate to EU red lines, throw his DUP allies under a bus and consent to a customs border down the Irish Sea which Theresa May once proclaimed \u201cno UK prime minister could ever agree\u201d to, and then for the Tory party to line up cravenly behind him.</p> \n<p>All Labour MPs believe in the inevitability of an election but are divided over the timing and circumstances. Some senior figures believe that there is a coordinated campaign within the parliamentary Labour party to put off an election until the spring.</p> \n<p>Partly, that\u2019s down to some MPs who represent majority leave communities fearing that their seats are at risk in a Brexit-defined election. Anti-Jeremy Corbyn MPs believe that there is still space for a government of national unity which, for them, has the advantage of removing Corbyn from his position. For obvious reasons, Corbyn sympathisers would rather push ahead with an election.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/23/johnson-and-corbyn-fail-to-agree-timetable-for-paused-brexit-bill\">Election rumours intensify after Johnson and Corbyn Brexit stalemate</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>How the electorate will respond to their Christmas shopping being interrupted by yet another vote worries MPs from all parties. One senior Labour shadow minister I spoke to is worrying about \u201ccampaigning in the rain and cold and dark \u2026 especially as tensions are so high\u201d, and is not alone in that fear.

      "bodyText": "Tis the season to be canvassing. The odds on the first December election for nearly a century have dramatically shortened. With Boris Johnson\u2019s commitment to Brexit happening by 31 October now dead in a ditch, the Vote Leave faction of his administration is pushing hard for the \u201cparliament versus the people\u201d contest they have always craved. The political calculations now made by Labour will prove critical to the prospects of the embattled Corbyn project. It was a strategic blunder for Labour and other opposition parties not to accept the election gauntlet when it was first thrown down in September. There were two reasons: the first was a genuine fear that no deal could be engineered mid-campaign. This was not baseless paranoia: the Johnson administration had proved itself to be devoid of trustworthiness, and the prime minister\u2019s special adviser, Dominic Cummings, had fed the prospect to the media. The second was driven by those who believed a pre-election people\u2019s vote was possible, potentially facilitated by a so-called government of national unity. But as one Labour source put it to me, the mistake everyone made was to presume that Johnson would not strike a deal with the EU. It wasn\u2019t his political ingenuity that was underestimated, but rather his willingness to capitulate to EU red lines, throw his DUP allies under a bus and consent to a customs border down the Irish Sea which Theresa May once proclaimed \u201cno UK prime minister could ever agree\u201d to, and then for the Tory party to line up cravenly behind him. All Labour MPs believe in the inevitability of an election but are divided over the timing and circumstances. Some senior figures believe that there is a coordinated campaign within the parliamentary Labour party to put off an election until the spring. Partly, that\u2019s down to some MPs who represent majority leave communities fearing that their seats are at risk in a Brexit-defined election. Anti-Jeremy Corbyn MPs believe that there is still space for a government of national unity which, for them, has the advantage of removing Corbyn from his position. For obvious reasons, Corbyn sympathisers would rather push ahead with an election. How the electorate will respond to their Christmas shopping being interrupted by yet another vote worries MPs from all parties. One senior Labour shadow minister I spoke to is worrying about \u201ccampaigning in the rain and cold and dark \u2026 especially as tensions are so high\u201d, and is not alone in that fear. Britain\u2019s already febrile political circumstances will only worsen when Johnson\u2019s \u201cdo or die\u201d Brexit pledge is broken, after all. The latest an election can take place in 2019 is 12 December; it would need to be called by early November to allow sufficient time for campaigning. Is a new year election possible if the EU offers an extension until the end of January? It seems far-fetched, but the EU \u2013 which will never be forced into a position where it takes the blame for no deal \u2013 has made it clear it would offer an extension in the event of a poll, and could plausibly add a month to allow a 2020 election to take place. But it is difficult to see how such a scenario could be agreed this side of Christmas, and Johnson may have succeeded in ramming his deal through by then anyway. Some of the pro-deal Labour MPs believe that the party will be liberated from the Brexit prison if Johnson\u2019s deal is voted through, freed to campaign on its core, bread and butter issues. This may provide a comforting rationalisation for politicians who are willing to lend votes to a hard-right project, but their actions will be relentlessly seized upon by a Liberal Democrat party seeking to exploit the subsequent fury of remainers. Both Jo Swinson and Johnson share a common aim: for the Lib Dems to eat into the Labour vote, the former to win a few more MPs, the latter to secure a majority for a hard-right government. Labour\u2019s least bad option, then, is to agree to an election, when it is proposed, after an extension is offered by the EU. Its current prospects seem bad. Its polling is terrible. But if it loses badly, it won\u2019t be because of an excessively radical domestic policy prospectus \u2013 which played a key role in its 2017 surge \u2013 but rather excessive triangulation and moderation on Brexit as the country polarised. It should have adopted its current policy of \u201ca referendum in all circumstances with remain on the ballot paper\u201d earlier. Centrists have now embraced the culture war enveloping the body politic \u2013 seeing remain as a new lasting identity allowing their political rebirth \u2013 while Johnson\u2019s forces eye working-class leavers in the small-town north and Midlands. Both phenomena pose huge challenges to Labour. The party transformed its fortunes last time, starting significantly further behind the Tories than now; but have views on both the Labour leader and the Brexit culture war become too entrenched?

It should confidently trumpet its \u201clet the people decide\u201d Brexit policy, offering the only plausible route back for remainers: a compromise position between hard Brexit and the Lib Dems\u2019 arrogantly undemocratic revoke. It understandably fears an election defined by Brexit, but offering clarity about a genuinely uncomplicated position gives it permission to talk about the issues it cares about, as well as winning back supporters who have fled to the Lib Dems and Greens. It must put domestic issues \u2013 taxing the rich and big business, public ownership, solving the housing crisis and a real living wage \u2013 centre stage, in part by emphasising that such \u201cburning injustices\u201d led to Brexit in the first place and offering optimistic can-do solutions. Given the existential climate threat facing humanity \u2013 and the urgency required to deal with the issue \u2013 it must make this a climate emergency election, buoyed by polls which show the environment has surged as an issue. Labour must pitch itself against an arrogant, entitled establishment personified by Johnson himself. Corbyn flourishes in campaigning mode: there is every prospect of reversing bad personal ratings, 2017-style. The Brexit culture war may devour the Corbyn project yet. But an election is coming, and Labour has no alternative but to embrace it. It is not a done deal for Johnson: his own cabinet ministers fret over the possible outcome.

      "body": "<p>Republicans push the bar ever lower. This president still cannot clear it. Even a month ago, Democrats were at pains to stress that a request for foreign interference in domestic politics was impeachable in and of itself, whether or not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\" title=\"\">Donald Trump</a> had offered a quid pro quo to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. There was a principled reason for this. Mr Trump and his supporters should not be allowed to present the manipulation of US diplomacy for private interests as normal practice. A country like Ukraine is hardly in a position to antagonise the American president; no explicit threat or inducement need be added to the scales. But in any case, the bargaining simply makes a terrible act much worse.</p> <p>Of course, the Democrats had a pragmatic reason for drawing the line: the knowledge that it might be hard to prove the attempted trading of interests. This is why Tuesday\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/22/us-ambassador-bill-taylor-ukraine-trump-military-aid-biden\" title=\"\">testimony</a> to impeachment inquiry hearings by Bill Taylor, the acting ambassador to Kyiv, drew gasps. It is not a surprise to anyone that the president should pursue such a course. But Mr Taylor, a veteran diplomat, laid out clearly, precisely and damningly how Mr Trump sought to make a summit meeting and military aid to Ukraine conditional on its government launching two investigations: one into his political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter, and another into the conspiracy theory that it was Ukraine (not Russia) that interfered in the 2016 election to benefit Hillary Clinton (rather than Mr Trump).</p> <p>The ambassador\u2019s evidence, building on testimony from the former top Russia adviser Fiona Hill, and his ousted predecessor Marie Yovanovitch, laid out the way this administration created a foreign policy back channel for this purpose, undermining its conventional diplomacy. It was run by the president through his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and figures including the ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, a donor to Trump\u2019s inauguration with no former diplomatic experience.</p> <p>Mr Taylor says Mr Sondland told him there was no quid pro quo \u2013 before spelling out an arrangement that is the very definition of a quid pro quo. Last week the acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/17/mick-mulvaney-trump-ukraine-quid-pro-quo\" title=\"\">agreed that there was</a>, but that it only related to 2016 \u2013 so \u201cget over it\u201d. (He subsequently walked back his remarks.) The White House continues to insist that there was no quid pro quo. To claim that no quid pro quo existed is like the rest of us claiming that Mr Trump is not the president. Life would be better if it were true, but wishful thinking does not make inconvenient facts disappear.</p> <p>The past cannot be undone, and things can be improved only if there is the will to do so. The Democrats\u2019 will was galvanised when they launched impeachment proceedings. Republicans are still floundering. Most managed to criticise Mr Trump\u2019s claim that he was facing a \u201clynching\u201d, a deliberately offensive and ridiculous attempt to distract from Mr Taylor\u2019s evidence and to rally his base with racialised imagery. But they continue to balk at taking him on for fear that they will be politically punished. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, refused to back Mr Trump\u2019s claims that he had described the president\u2019s call with Mr Zelenskiy as \u201cinnocent\u201d.</p> <p>That is as far as he has gone. Like his colleagues, he seeks to avoid the taint of Mr Trump without actually cutting him loose. They have no will to protect the standards of office \u2013 just the hope that all this will go away if they keep lowering very basic expectations for the highest office in the land.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Republicans push the bar ever lower. This president still cannot clear it. Even a month ago, Democrats were at pains to stress that a request for foreign interference in domestic politics was impeachable in and of itself, whether or not Donald Trump had offered a quid pro quo to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. There was a principled reason for this. Mr Trump and his supporters should not be allowed to present the manipulation of US diplomacy for private interests as normal practice. A country like Ukraine is hardly in a position to antagonise the American president; no explicit threat or inducement need be added to the scales. But in any case, the bargaining simply makes a terrible act much worse. Of course, the Democrats had a pragmatic reason for drawing the line: the knowledge that it might be hard to prove the attempted trading of interests. This is why Tuesday\u2019s testimony to impeachment inquiry hearings by Bill Taylor, the acting ambassador to Kyiv, drew gasps. It is not a surprise to anyone that the president should pursue such a course. But Mr Taylor, a veteran diplomat, laid out clearly, precisely and damningly how Mr Trump sought to make a summit meeting and military aid to Ukraine conditional on its government launching two investigations: one into his political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter, and another into the conspiracy theory that it was Ukraine (not Russia) that interfered in the 2016 election to benefit Hillary Clinton (rather than Mr Trump). The ambassador\u2019s evidence, building on testimony from the former top Russia adviser Fiona Hill, and his ousted predecessor Marie Yovanovitch, laid out the way this administration created a foreign policy back channel for this purpose, undermining its conventional diplomacy. It was run by the president through his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and figures including the ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, a donor to Trump\u2019s inauguration with no former diplomatic experience. Mr Taylor says Mr Sondland told him there was no quid pro quo \u2013 before spelling out an arrangement that is the very definition of a quid pro quo. Last week the acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney agreed that there was, but that it only related to 2016 \u2013 so \u201cget over it\u201d. (He subsequently walked back his remarks.) The White House continues to insist that there was no quid pro quo. To claim that no quid pro quo existed is like the rest of us claiming that Mr Trump is not the president. Life would be better if it were true, but wishful thinking does not make inconvenient facts disappear. The past cannot be undone, and things can be improved only if there is the will to do so. The Democrats\u2019 will was galvanised when they launched impeachment proceedings. Republicans are still floundering. Most managed to criticise Mr Trump\u2019s claim that he was facing a \u201clynching\u201d, a deliberately offensive and ridiculous attempt to distract from Mr Taylor\u2019s evidence and to rally his base with racialised imagery. But they continue to balk at taking him on for fear that they will be politically punished. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, refused to back Mr Trump\u2019s claims that he had described the president\u2019s call with Mr Zelenskiy as \u201cinnocent\u201d. That is as far as he has gone. Like his colleagues, he seeks to avoid the taint of Mr Trump without actually cutting him loose. They have no will to protect the standards of office \u2013 just the hope that all this will go away if they keep lowering very basic expectations for the highest office in the land.",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump Democrats announced an official impeachment inquiry into Trump on 24 September following a whistleblower\u2019s complaint about Trump\u2019s interactions with the president of Ukraine. A White House summary of a 25 July call shows Trump pressed Volodymyr Zelenskiy to work with the US attorney general and Rudy Giuliani, to investigate his political rival Joe Biden in the run-up the 2020 US election. Trump told Zelenskiy to look into unfounded and debunked allegations that Biden helped remove a Ukrainian prosecutor who had investigated a company tied to his son Hunter. Volodymyr Zelenskiy Ukraine\u2019s new president was a wildcard candidate who had no experience of politics save for playing the president in a television comedy. In a remarkable plot twist, he\u2019s now been thrust into the centre of an American political scandal. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be involved in democratic elections of the USA,\u201d Zelenskiy said in September, visibly embarrassed after the release of the summary. \u201cWe had a good phone call. It was normal. You read it. Nobody pushed me.\u201d Joe Biden Currently a strong candidate in the 2020 race for the Democratic presidential nomination, Biden was the vice-president in 2016, when the Obama administration pressured Ukraine to remove Viktor Shokin, the country\u2019s top prosecutor; the US and other western countries said Shokin was corrupt. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden. \u201cThis is not a Republican issue or a Democratic issue. It is a national security issue,\u201d Biden said. Hunter Biden Joe Biden\u2019s second son served on the board of Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian gas producer, from 2014 to 2019. Burisma had been investigated by Shokin for alleged corruption, but the investigation had been dropped by the time the US government urged Ukraine to fire Shokin. Viktor Shokin The former Ukrainian prosecutor general was widely seen as having blocked the prosecutions of corrupt oligarchs. Reform-minded Ukrainian politicians and international partners pressured the Ukrainian government to remove him for some time, and he was finally dismissed in 2016. He was later reinvented as a kind of heroic victim by Giuliani, who claimed \u2013 without evidence \u2013 that Shokin was fired on Biden\u2019s orders. Rudy Giuliani The former mayor of New York is Trump\u2019s personal attorney, most strident TV defender and, it seems, occasional diplomat. The rough transcript of the Trump-Zelenskiy phone call shows Trump telling the Ukraine president to work with Giuliani in investigating Joe Biden. According to the whistleblower\u2019s complaint, US officials were concerned about Giuliani\u2019s role in communications with Kyiv. William \u2018Bill\u2019 Barr The attorney general is named by Trump in the call with Zelenskiy, the president saying Zelenskiy should work with Barr \u2013 and Giuliani \u2013 to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden. The Department of Justice, which Barr oversees, said Trump had not asked Barr to work with Ukraine. The DoJ examined the Trump-Zelenskiy call but decided not to open an investigation \u2013 a decision which has been criticized by legal analysts. The whistleblower Little is known about the identity of the person who ignited the firestorm engulfing Trump. Testifying on Thursday before Congress, the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, said he did not know who the whistleblower was; Trump has said the same. The whistleblower has retained a lawyer and is said to be willing to testify before Congress. The New York Times reported the whistleblower is a CIA officer. Kurt Volker The former US special envoy to Ukraine, Volker resigned from the state department and met with congressional investigators, turning over records of WhatsApp chats in which he and other US diplomats worked to arrange a deal between Zelenskiy and Trump in which Trump would invite Zelenskiy to the White House and Zelenskiy would make a public statement that Ukraine had opened investigations of Burisma and election tampering. \u201cI think Potus really wants the deliverable,\u201d Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union, said on the chats. Gordon Sondland A wealthy hotelier, Trump mega-donor and now US ambassador to the European Union. In the chats turned over by Volker, Sondland, whose usual portfolio does not include Ukraine, pushed Volker and a third diplomat, Bill Taylor, to get what Trump wants from Zelenskiy.

Taylor delivered testimony in October seen as devastating. He described how diplomats and Giuliani pursued Trump\u2019s demand that Zelenskiy go on CNN and announce of investigation of Biden. Taylor said Sondland told him that both military aid and a White House visit \u2013 \u201ceverything\u201d \u2013 hinged on Zelenskiy\u2019s willingness to announce the investigation. In the chats, Taylor repeatedly expressed alarm about the deal Sondland was trying to put together. \u201cAs I said on the phone, I think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d Taylor wrote.

The acting director said he thought issues raised in the complaint might be covered by executive privilege, and he said he consulted with officials at the justice department and White House lawyers over whether to pass the complaint to Congress. The White House eventually published the complaint. Michael Atkinson After receiving the complaint, Atkinson, the inspector general for the intelligence community, recommended it be shared with Congress. This put Atkinson at odds with his superior, Maguire, who blocked it from being shared. While the complaint was being withheld, Atkinson alerted lawmakers to its existence, saying it raised issues of \u201curgent concern\u201d. Nancy Pelosi The speaker of the House, and the most powerful woman in Congress, Pelosi decided to initiate an impeachment inquiry after the rough transcript of the Trump-Zelenskiy call was published on Wednesday. In doing so, Pelosi succumbed to long-mounting pressure from Democratic members of Congress, some of whom had been pushing for an impeachment inquiry to begin for more than a year. Yuriy Lutsenko A veteran on the political scene, Lutsenko replaced Shokin as Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general but was also viewed with suspicion by reformers. Lutsenko met Giuliani and appears to have been amenable to opening an investigation into unsubstantiated claims of Ukrainian interference in the 2016 US election on behalf of the Democrats. Ukrainian officials have denied any effort to help Hillary Clinton in the election. Marie Yovanovitch Yovanovitch was the US ambassador to Ukraine for almost three years before being unexpectedly recalled by Trump in May this year. Trump criticized Yovanovitch in his call with Zelenskiy, describing her as \u201cbad news\u201d. In March, Yovanovitch called on Ukraine to do more to address corruption. Then Lutsenko accused Yovanovitch of giving Ukraine \u201ca list of people whom we should not prosecute\u201d. Lutsenko has since said Yovanovitch did not give him such a list. Serhiy Leshchenko One of the new brand of politicians who entered the scene after Ukraine\u2019s Maidan revolution, Leshchenko was a leading political journalist who wrote widely on corruption and became an MP. In May 2016, he published information from a so-called \u201cblack ledger\u201d that showed under-the-table payments from the pro-Russian former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych\u2019s regime to various figures including Trump\u2019s former 2016 campaign manager Paul Manafort.

      "bodyText": "History never repeats itself but, according to the IMF, it might this time (Red alert as world ignores history lesson, 17 October). Despite countless publications and studies related to the 2008 financial crisis and its effect on the whole economic system, politicians, central banks and economic institutions seem to keep using the same logic that they used 10 years ago. The decrease in interest rates caused by central banks\u2019 policies provoked the boom of private debt held by companies. Together with the constant diminution of companies\u2019 abilities to repay their debts, this presents a clear underlying problem and a terrible outlook of a new global economic crisis. By favouring short-term decisions and policies in order to maintain growth at an acceptable rate as the recent IMF report proves, central banks keep committing the same errors. Will the world economic system be able to avoid another crisis if we continue to accumulate more and more risk factors? Milan Bollecker Paris, France \u2022 Larry Elliott, in his analysis (A King\u2019s sad lament shows the lessons of 2008 were not learned, 21 October), gives a frightening picture of the confused economic thinking coming from the IMF\u2019s annual meeting, and this does not include the ideas of its own Global Housing Watch \u201cthat there is abundant evidence that housing cycles can be a threat to financial and macroeconomic stability\u201d so that that \u201cthe era of benign neglect of house price booms is over\u201d. As a long-time adherent of Henry George, via the Labour Land Campaign, I wonder how the neglect of house prices can ever be benign, since it ends up with people priced out of housing by high rents and mortgages, so using up the spending power provided to workers by capitalists to buy their products and services.

John Richards Oxford \u2022 Your editorial (22 October) ponders the return of James Joyce\u2019s ashes to Dublin, the city of his birth. Last summer, during a 150-minute open-top bus tour of the city, I did not hear the author\u2019s name mentioned once. I wonder, do Dubliners want him back? Dick Curtis Gloucester \u2022 There isn\u2019t much to smile about at Swansea station car park. But the signs put up earlier this year, since taken down, had that effect: \u201cPay before existing\u201d (Letters, 23 October). Richard Daugherty Swansea \u2022 Wouldn\u2019t it be a refreshing change to see Mr Cummings leaving No 10 Downing Street (Report, 22 October)?

Prof Ian Shanks, who has been fighting for compensation for 13 years, has been awarded compensation by the supreme court. Shanks came up with a prototype of the electrochemical capillary fill device (ECFD) while working for a subsidiary of Unilever in Bedford in the 1980s. Shanks told the Guardian in 2010 that he had been inspired by LCD technology to create a device in which a small, known volume of blood was drawn up into a cell between two glass plates and the concentration of particular substances within it measured. \u201cI thought about it a while, and I demonstrated it at home using glass slides from my daughter\u2019s toy microscope kit,\u201d he said at the time. Shanks took his invention to his employer, who told him that the company owned it. Unilever went on to patent the invention and from the 1990s it sold licences to other companies to use the technology. Lord Kitchin, a justice of the supreme court, noted that \u201cECFD technology eventually appeared in most glucose testing products\u201d. Shanks\u2019s idea became ubiquitous, with the technology underpinning a new type of glucose sensor that was cheap and required very little blood to use.

Kitchin said Shanks was entitled to a fair share of the benefit seen by the company, even though Shanks accepted that Unilever owned the rights to his invention. The justice said the rewards Unilever enjoyed \u201cwere substantial and significant, were generated at no significant risk, reflected a very high rate of return, and stood out in comparison with the benefit Unilever derived from other patents.\u201d A Unilever spokesperson said: \u201cWe are disappointed with the decision to overturn the previous three judgments and award Dr Shanks a share of the licence revenue obtained by Unilever in addition to the salary, bonuses and benefits he was compensated with while employed to develop new products for the business.\u201d",

Family reunion routes \u2013 that is, those granted refugee status in the UK being able to apply to bring relatives to join them \u2013 have been drastically curtailed.</p> <p>The UK gave protection \u2013 grants of asylum, humanitarian protection or alternative forms of leave and resettlement \u2013 to 18,519 people in the year ending June 2019, according to the most recently available figures.</p> <p>However, it is relatively hard to secure asylum in the UK, which hosts less than 1% of the world\u2019s refugees.</p> <p>Furthermore, the hostile environment policy, including the UK\u2019s use of immigration detention (it is one of the only countries in the world where the period of detention is not capped), is likely to have deterred some people from wanting to seek asylum at all for fear they will end up in purgatory.</p> <p>The Dublin regulation, an EU law which states that an individual is eligible to be given asylum only in the first safe country they arrive in, encouraged people with good reasons for wanting to travel to the UK \u2013 for example, good command of the language \u2013 to attempt to do so by dangerous backdoor routes, often facilitated by ruthless people smugglers.</p> <p>The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants said: \u201cNobody should be in any doubt that the ultimate responsibility for these deaths lies with government policy, which has deliberately shut down safe and legal routes to the UK.</p> <p>\u201cWe need more than empty expressions of sadness and shock from Priti Patel and Boris Johnson. We need a commitment to opening safe and legal routes to the UK and quick decisions for people seeking to make a better life for themselves in the UK. People move \u2013 they always have and they always will. Nobody should have to risk their life to do so.\u201d</p> <p>The National Crime Agency has responsibility for tackling what it calls organised immigration crime. This stands apart from modern slavery and human trafficking because it involves consent on the part of the individual travelling, while the latter involves coerced movement across borders. However, there is an obvious overlap and the incident in Essex could be either of the two.</p> <p>A range of methods are used in organised immigration crime, including clandestine entry from near Europe, air-facilitated migration, use of false or fraudulently obtained documents and abuse of legitimate entry and leave to remain.</p> <p>In 2018 new migrant camps emerged in the Grande-Synthe and Puythouck Lake areas near Dunkirk, where organised crime gangs are known to be active, recruiting migrants for onward movement to the UK.</p> <p>Juxtaposed border controls remain the main targets for clandestine entry into the UK. These controls are part of an arrangement between the UK, France and Belgium whereby immigration checks on certain cross-Channel routes take place before boarding a train or ferry, rather than on arrival.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/23/essex-lorry-borders-governments\">The Essex lorry deaths throw up so many questions. It\u2019s vital we ask the right ones | Daniel Trilling</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 2018 the number of Eritreans detected at juxtaposed controls increased notably, with Eritrean nationals found concealed in refrigerated lorries and containers, probably indicating growing levels of organisation.</p> <p>The Guardian understands that last year more than 35,000 attempts to cross the Channel illegally were prevented at the UK\u2019s juxtaposed controls in northern France and Belgium. During the same 12-month period, more than 8,000 people were detected in the UK, either at ports of entry or having entered the country illegally on a vehicle.</p> <p>The top 10 nationalities of undocumented people found at juxtaposed controls in 2018 were Eritrean, Iraqi, Afghan, Iranian, Albanian, Sudanese, Vietnamese, Pakistani, Syrian and Ethiopian.</p> <p>What could be done in the UK to reduce the chance of individuals attempting such risky journeys?

      "bodyText": "The discovery of 39 people dead in the back of a lorry in Essex has renewed focus on the risks taken by undocumented migrants to travel to the UK to seek safety and shelter. A lack of safe and legal routes into the UK is in part driving a dependence on life-threatening methods including squeezing into the back of refrigerated lorries or riding in vulnerable dinghies across wild seas. People fleeing the threat of torture, rape or death cannot claim asylum in the UK without physically reaching Britain, aside from a few limited programmes including the Syrian refugee resettlement programme. Family reunion routes \u2013 that is, those granted refugee status in the UK being able to apply to bring relatives to join them \u2013 have been drastically curtailed. The UK gave protection \u2013 grants of asylum, humanitarian protection or alternative forms of leave and resettlement \u2013 to 18,519 people in the year ending June 2019, according to the most recently available figures. However, it is relatively hard to secure asylum in the UK, which hosts less than 1% of the world\u2019s refugees. Furthermore, the hostile environment policy, including the UK\u2019s use of immigration detention (it is one of the only countries in the world where the period of detention is not capped), is likely to have deterred some people from wanting to seek asylum at all for fear they will end up in purgatory. The Dublin regulation, an EU law which states that an individual is eligible to be given asylum only in the first safe country they arrive in, encouraged people with good reasons for wanting to travel to the UK \u2013 for example, good command of the language \u2013 to attempt to do so by dangerous backdoor routes, often facilitated by ruthless people smugglers. The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants said: \u201cNobody should be in any doubt that the ultimate responsibility for these deaths lies with government policy, which has deliberately shut down safe and legal routes to the UK. \u201cWe need more than empty expressions of sadness and shock from Priti Patel and Boris Johnson. We need a commitment to opening safe and legal routes to the UK and quick decisions for people seeking to make a better life for themselves in the UK. People move \u2013 they always have and they always will. Nobody should have to risk their life to do so.\u201d The National Crime Agency has responsibility for tackling what it calls organised immigration crime. This stands apart from modern slavery and human trafficking because it involves consent on the part of the individual travelling, while the latter involves coerced movement across borders. However, there is an obvious overlap and the incident in Essex could be either of the two. A range of methods are used in organised immigration crime, including clandestine entry from near Europe, air-facilitated migration, use of false or fraudulently obtained documents and abuse of legitimate entry and leave to remain. In 2018 new migrant camps emerged in the Grande-Synthe and Puythouck Lake areas near Dunkirk, where organised crime gangs are known to be active, recruiting migrants for onward movement to the UK. Juxtaposed border controls remain the main targets for clandestine entry into the UK. These controls are part of an arrangement between the UK, France and Belgium whereby immigration checks on certain cross-Channel routes take place before boarding a train or ferry, rather than on arrival. In 2018 the number of Eritreans detected at juxtaposed controls increased notably, with Eritrean nationals found concealed in refrigerated lorries and containers, probably indicating growing levels of organisation. The Guardian understands that last year more than 35,000 attempts to cross the Channel illegally were prevented at the UK\u2019s juxtaposed controls in northern France and Belgium. During the same 12-month period, more than 8,000 people were detected in the UK, either at ports of entry or having entered the country illegally on a vehicle. The top 10 nationalities of undocumented people found at juxtaposed controls in 2018 were Eritrean, Iraqi, Afghan, Iranian, Albanian, Sudanese, Vietnamese, Pakistani, Syrian and Ethiopian. What could be done in the UK to reduce the chance of individuals attempting such risky journeys? Refugee and asylum seeker rights campaigners have been calling for an extension to refugee family reunion rules to include a wider definition of family, allowing individuals safely based in the UK to bring family members to join them. There have also been calls for the resettlement programme for Syrian refugees, which is run by the UN refugee agency, to be extended to other countries. \u2022 This article was amended on 24 October 2019 because an earlier version referred to the Syrian refugee settlement programme as the only one which operates without the person reaching Britain. The Syrian programme is one of a small number of limited refugee resettlement schemes.",

response of studied fury to <strong>Boris Johnson</strong>\u2019s response to SNP Westminster leader <strong>Ian Blackford</strong> during FMQs today that the Scottish parliament \u201chas no role\u201d in approving his current withdrawal deal.</p> \n  <p>While it was immediately pointed out that the bill\u2019s own explanatory notes list more than a dozen instances where consent of the devolved administrations is required, the first ministers of Scotland and Wales, Nicola Sturgeon and Mark Drakeford, this afternoon accused the prime minister of trying to rush through the EU withdrawal agreement without scrutiny. </p> \n  <p>They both added that said the Scottish parliament and Welsh assembly were likely to refuse to give consent for the withdrawal agreement bill, and called for the devolved nations to be given a greater say.</p> \n  <p>SNP MP and Brexit legal challenger Joanna Cherry said that the prime minister was \u201cwholly wrong\u201d and \u201ca stranger to the truth\u201d, while Scotland\u2019s Brexit secretary, Michael Russell, described Johnson\u2019s dismissal as \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d, adding that the Scottish government had already identified a number of additional parts of the bill that required legislative consent too.</p> \n  <p>Point of info: since 1999, the Sewel convention has held that Westminster will not legislate on devolved matters without the consent of the devolved parliaments, but in 2017 the supreme court appeared to undermine this convention by ruling that because it is political in nature, enforcing it was not a matter for the courts.<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-23T15:42:11.309Z\">at 4.42pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div

the prime minister negotiated a new withdrawal agreement with the EU which will end the uncertainty, secure the implementation period and ensure we leave with a business-friendly deal.</p> \n   <p>As

The full article is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/22/what-just-happened-in-the-commons-and-whats-next-for-brexit\">here</a> and a selection of answers are below:</p> \n  <h2>So what just happened?</h2> \n  <p>In brief: the bill seeking to put into law Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal was passed by MPs on its second reading, the initial opportunity that MPs have to vote on a bill. It passed by 329 votes to 299, the first time the Commons has formally approved a Brexit plan. However, only 20 minutes later, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/22/mps-reject-boris-johnsons-attempt-to-fast-track-brexit-deal\">MPs rejected the government\u2019s so-called programme motion</a>, which set out the accelerated timetable for the bill, by 308 votes in favour to 322 against.</p> \n  <h2>So what happens now?<br></h2> \n  <p>Under a backbench-instigated law intended to ward off a no-deal Brexit, Johnson wrote to the EU on Saturday to formally request a delay to departure until 31 January, despite the PM not wanting this to happen. Responding in the Commons, Johnson said he would \u201cpause this legislation\u201d and await information from the EU on a possible delay. In the interim, he said, no-deal preparations would be ramped up. For now, the bill is \u201cin limbo\u201d, Speaker John Bercow said, using what he said was the technical term.</p> \n  <h2>Is the bill getting pulled?</h2> \n  <p>Downing Street had strongly hinted this would be the response to losing the programme motion. However, this seems to have been a lever to pressure MPs into backing the motion. Speaking during the debate ahead of the votes, Johnson pledged he would pull the bill and seek an election in the event of a delay until January or longer. But he did not promise to do this in any circumstances, holding open the possibility of a brief delay being acceptable. After the vote, Johnson was similarly equivocal, saying: \u201cOne way or another, we will leave the EU with this deal.\u201d</p> \n  <h2>Does all this make a general election more likely?</h2> \n  <p>Probably. If the EU insists on a lengthy delay, which is put in place, Johnson could push for an election. Crucially, if an imminent no-deal Brexit was now averted, Labour would be expected to now back an election, making it happen. However, for all his protestations against a longer delay, the 30-vote majority for his Brexit deal could tempt Johnson into trying to push the bill through parliament before an election, allowing him to stand as the prime minister who delivered departure.</p> \n  <h2>What will MPs do for the rest of this week?</h2> \n  <p>On Wednesday and Thursday, when they should have been finishing off the stages of the WAB, they will instead return to debating the Queen\u2019s speech. Remember that? The government\u2019s planned legislative programme was presented on Monday last week, but the scheduled five-day debate was suspended for the WAB debate.

      "bodyText": "On this week\u2019s episode of the Guardian\u2019s politics weekly podcast, Heather Stewart is joined by Polly Toynbee, Jill Rutter and Tom McTague to discuss what Boris Johnson will do after parliament voted to reject his timetable for the passage of the Brexit withdrawal bill. Peter Walker also reports on who\u2019s in the running to be the next Speaker of the House of Commons Thanks for following the blog today. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow morning. One last footnote though in relation to moves we reported on earlier this week by Ukip to suspend its leader Richard Braine amid a fresh power struggle within the party. This comes from Companies House filings: \u2022 Downing Street is pushing the possibility of a general election after talks between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn on a new timetable for his Brexit bill broke up without agreement, but Labour declined to say it would support an immediate poll. No 10 also said that Johnson spoke to Donald Tusk on Wednesday morning, telling the European council\u2019s president, who has called for EU leaders to allow a further Brexit extension, that he does not personally want one. \u2022 The Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, and the European parliament\u2019s president have backed Donald Tusk\u2019s call to grant the UK government a Brexit delay up to 31 January 2020. Following a phone call between Tusk, the president of the European council, and Varadkar on Wednesday morning, the two men agreed the EU27 should agree to the request reluctantly tabled by Boris Johnson on Saturday. \u2022 Unionist MPs have branded the government\u2019s approach to Northern Ireland in the Brexit talks \u201cdespicable\u201d and a \u201cbetrayal\u201d. In his first appearance before the Northern Ireland affairs select committee, Julian Smith, the Northern Ireland secretary, was questioned about plans to require businesses selling or transiting goods from the region to Britain to complete special paperwork in order to trade post-Brexit. \u2022 The home secretary, Priti Patel, has told MPs that immigration officials were working closely with the police after 39 bodies were found inside a Bulgarian-registered lorry on an industrial estate in Essex. A murder investigation is under way after police officers were called by the ambulance service shortly before 1.40am on Wednesday following the discovery of a container with people inside. Appearing at the home affairs committee, Patel said: \u201cAs a live investigation, there is not much we can add to that right now. And from what I gather things are moving quite quickly on that. The European parliament\u2019s Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, has this on a meeting today, which adds weight to shortening odds of a \u201cFlextension\u201d being the preferred reply to the UK government\u2019s request for an extension. The Tory former leader of the House of Commons, Mel Stride, has been elected as the new chairman of the influential Treasury committee. The Speaker, John Bercow, informed MPs of the result of the ballot in the Commons in a statement during the Queen\u2019s speech debate. Stride, who was present alongside his fellow nominees to hear the news, said he hoped his committee could \u201cbring forward some illumination and light\u201d at a time of \u201cgreat sound and fury in this chamber\u201d. Proposals for \u201cA&amp;E locals\u201d were compared to Tesco Express shops as Labour raised concerns about government reforms to the NHS during the ongoing debate on the Queen\u2019s speech. The shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, sought answers over changes to the Princess Royal hospital in Telford after the health secretary, Matt Hancock, asked NHS England to keep open the service. It is among those being considered under plans for \u201cA&amp;E locals\u201d although health bosses have questioned what this means. Ashworth also claimed the government\u2019s immigration plans could leave 60,000 NHS workers unable to stay in the UK. Speaker John Bercow selected Labour\u2019s amendment which notes \u201cregret\u201d over the Queen\u2019s Speech failure to repeal the Health and Social Care Act 2012, arguing this needs to happen to \u201cprotect\u201d the NHS from future trade agreements which could allow increased privatisation. Any Brexit extension is likely to be a flexible one that would allow the UK to leave the EU prior to the end of January, Ireland\u2019s deputy premier has said. Simon Coveney, said the Irish government would be supportive of an extension but he cautioned that he was not speaking on behalf of the other EU states and said it was a case of \u201cwait and see\u201d if any of them raised \u201cissues\u201d with the move. Speaking to business leaders in Belfast, he said: From the Irish government\u2019s perspective we are supportive of facilitating an extension. I think that extension will be a flexible one that will allow the United Kingdom to leave the EU, if they can get a deal done, well in advance of the end of that extension period, which looks like it might be the end of January. The former Labour (now independent) MP, Ivan Lewis, appears to have moved with some certainty into the cohort of those supporting the prime minster\u2019s Brexit deal. Lewis, who voted against Theresa May\u2019s deal, has tweeted: YouGov has been carrying out some snap polling and finds that votes are fairly split on when they would prefer a general election. One in the spring (40% support) shades it over one by the end of the year. Government thinking on development and aid priorities following Brexit should take note of new research out today showing that the British public remains firmly behind efforts to support people in poorer countries, according to aid organisations. Almost two-thirds of people canvassed in a survey of EU citizens believe that maintaining overseas aid at its current level should be \u201ca major priority\u201d, the Guardian\u2019s Lucy Lamble reports. It\u2019s perhaps worth keeping in mind also that while any impending general election is likely to be firmly centred around Brexit, overseas aid has increasingly become a political football, with the Brexit party making pledges to slash the spending. The results from Eurobarometer, the EU\u2019s polling organisation, also found that almost 90% of people thought helping people in developing countries should be a priority of the EU and national governments. Claire Godfrey, interim director of policy, advocacy and research at Bond, the British network for organisations working in international development, said the survey was \u201cincredibly timely\u201d as the UK government begins to redefine its role in a post-Brexit world. The government, and any future government, should take note of these results when thinking about what our development and aid priorities should be following Brexit. There has been a response of studied fury to Boris Johnson\u2019s response to SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford during FMQs today that the Scottish parliament \u201chas no role\u201d in approving his current withdrawal deal. While it was immediately pointed out that the bill\u2019s own explanatory notes list more than a dozen instances where consent of the devolved administrations is required, the first ministers of Scotland and Wales, Nicola Sturgeon and Mark Drakeford, this afternoon accused the prime minister of trying to rush through the EU withdrawal agreement without scrutiny. They both added that said the Scottish parliament and Welsh assembly were likely to refuse to give consent for the withdrawal agreement bill, and called for the devolved nations to be given a greater say. SNP MP and Brexit legal challenger Joanna Cherry said that the prime minister was \u201cwholly wrong\u201d and \u201ca stranger to the truth\u201d, while Scotland\u2019s Brexit secretary, Michael Russell, described Johnson\u2019s dismissal as \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d, adding that the Scottish government had already identified a number of additional parts of the bill that required legislative consent too. Point of info: since 1999, the Sewel convention has held that Westminster will not legislate on devolved matters without the consent of the devolved parliaments, but in 2017 the supreme court appeared to undermine this convention by ruling that because it is political in nature, enforcing it was not a matter for the courts. Businesses and the public should continue to get ready for a no-deal Brexit, the government has warned, as a minister said there was still uncertainty about how the UK will leave the EU. This was from earlier when minister without portfolio James Cleverly told MPs that the \u201conly responsible course of action\u201d, is to \u201caccelerate\u201d no-deal planning. He said more preparations were needed because the EU has not yet responded to calls for an extension to the 31 October Brexit deadline. Cleverly told the Commons: Making sure business and the public are ready for Brexit is a priority of the government; that is why the prime minister negotiated a new withdrawal agreement with the EU which will end the uncertainty, secure the implementation period and ensure we leave with a business-friendly deal. As the EU has not responded to parliament\u2019s letter, the only responsible course of action now is to accelerate preparations for a no-deal outcome. Those comments are interesting to read alongside this piece in the Guardian by a civil servant who is currently part of the Operation Yellowhammer planning for a no-deal scenario. Much of this Yellowhammer shtick is just for show, they write, adding: Heaven help us if no deal actually happens. Because, even with the best efforts of civil servants like me, Operation Yellowhammer won\u2019t be enough, even with its enormous price tag. Not even close. And while \u2013 outrageously \u2013 there won\u2019t be any economic analysis prepared by the government on the impact of the new deal, we already know \u2013 thanks to Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts \u2013 that the impact of no deal will make the \u00a36.3bn spent this year on no-deal planning look like peanuts. The intransigence of members of the hardline European Research Group (ERG) in the face of attempts by Theresa May to get MPs to accept her Brexit deal was one of the principle flashpoints of her time in office. So what changed? Phil Burton-Cartledge, a lecturer in sociology at the University of Derby, argues that their volte-face may have been encouraged by aligned financial interests: A deskilled, low-wage workforce with few rights, and the UK a playground for footloose corporations to shake their tail at the EU\u2019s regulatory regime from 21 miles across the Channel, would suit them perfectly. Therefore when you look at the kind of businesses associated with or owned by ERG notables, such as Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s emerging markets fund or Steve Baker\u2019s financial services holdings, it suggests their penchant for transforming the country into a no-regulation tax haven may align with their interests. Ideology and principles come second. If the EU does agree to a three-month delay to Brexit until 31 January then the prime minister has three options if he decides to push for an election. The Guardian\u2019s Kate Proctor has been looking at all three, which are: \u2022 A motion for a general election. \u2022 A one-line bill. \u2022 A no-confidence motion. Of the first option, which is seen as the government\u2019s favoured option because it is unamendable and gives a fixed election date, she writes: Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, an election may be called if it is agreed by two-thirds of the total number of MPs. Boris Johnson presented motions for an election on 4 and 9 September and failed on both occasions when the majority of Labour MPs abstained. Jeremy Corbyn said he would only back an election once the threat of a no-deal Brexit had been taken off the table. Johnson could try this again and potentially get Labour backing because the Benn act has removed the imminent possibility of a no-deal Brexit. For those wondering when Brussels will make any concrete pronouncements on that reluctant Boris Johnson request for a Brexit extension: Businesses remain \u201cat a loss\u201d about what Brexit preparations they should be making amid continued confusion about the future, according to a business leader. The Chartered Management Institute (CMI) said progress on parliament\u2019s support for a deal had been undermined by the timetable being voted down and the \u201cinflexibility\u201d of the government\u2019s response. Chief executive Ann Francke said: Businesses are again lost as to what Brexit preparations they should be making, creating economic uncertainty. Are we deal or no-deal? Clearly we should deal. To do so, the prime minister needs to take a pragmatic, cooperative approach to his work with both parliament and the European Union, to ensure the UK secures a deal. Kevin Brundish, chief executive of AGM Batteries, said each day of Brexit uncertainty means firms are withholding key investment decisions. As demand for batteries continues to rise, leading UK manufacturers like ourselves are hoping for the UK government to settle on the right deal, fast. The fragile economy needs promise of ongoing stimulation if we are to keep up with the expansion of the market. One place where there appears to be some confusion around Brexit preparations is at this London bus stop, where government \u201cGet Ready\u201d digital advertising appears to be in some disarray. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has criticised the abuse directed at the 19 Labour MPs who voted to support the WAB\u2019s second reading on Tuesday. As reported earlier, Lisa Nandy MP tweeted emails sent to her labelling her \u201cscum\u201d. A spokesman for Corbyn told the Press Association: \u201cHe has made very clear that there shouldn\u2019t be abuse inside the Labour party or inside politics and that we would seek to rely on persuasion to keep the Labour party together in this process and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done all the way through.\u201d Asked whether there would be repercussions for the Labour rebels after defying the whip, the spokesman said: \u201cAs Jeremy has made clear throughout the whole Brexit process, we have sought to rely on persuasion in relation to keeping the Labour party together in parliament and outside. \u201cI think most of those MPs were making clear their support for a second reading was in order to try and make changes to the proposals to bring them into line with the kind of Brexit deal we have been talking about. \u201cThe chief whip has made clear these things will be taken into account as a whole once the process is finished.\u201d Adam Bienkov, UK Political Editor of Business Insider, tweets an exchange he had with the prime minister\u2019s spokesman when attempting to ask why Boris Johnson has insisted that there won\u2019t be checks between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, even though his own impact assessment states that there will. A useful overview now of where things really stand in relation to the Brexit timetable which MPs rejected this week, the EU\u2019s response and whether or not European leaders will agree to a Brexit extension. Dan Boffey, the Guardian\u2019s Brussels bureau chief, reports that Donald Tusk, president of the European council, will be arguing that the EU should remain neutral. Dan adds: By granting the UK government the extension it requested, the bloc can best avoid being dragged into the British debate. Should Johnson formally and publicly propose a different extension length, then the situation will be very different. The successful vote on the second reading has offered some hope to Brussels that there is a majority for ratification, and that a general election might not be necessary. But a new request from Johnson would not appear to be in compliance with the Benn act, which instructed him to make a specific request and then agree it with the EU if they were in accord. Sources in Paris have suggested there should be a further delay of only a \u201cfew days\u201d to allow for ratification. That would leave the EU jointly culpable for a no-deal Brexit, if swift ratification was not possible. Tusk will counsel against it. Poland\u2019s Europe minister has rejected a plea by the Polish-born Tory MP Daniel Kawczynski to veto an extension to Brexit, according to Jakub Krupa, the former UK correspondent for the Polish Press Agency. Krupa was told that a \u201cno-deal Brexit is not in the Polish interest and we will have no part in this\u201d. Not that the news comes as any particular surprise. A split in Downing Downing street has opened up between Boris Johnson\u2019s chief aide, Dominic Cummings, other senior officials and Tory ministers and MPs over what to do after the failed attempt to ram a Brexit deal through parliament this week, BuzzFeed reports. A piece from Alex Wickham says: \u201cIt is the latest dividing line in the story of Johnson\u2019s \u201ctwo governments\u201d \u2013 the factional rivalry of two sides of Number 10 vying for influence that has been one of the defining features of his premiership. \u201cCummings has been the main driving force behind the renewed push for an immediate election, multiple sources familiar with the conversations in Downing Street told BuzzFeed News.\u201d Sky\u2019s Sam Coates tweets a denial from Downing Street: A bit more is coming out now on where things stand in relation to engagement between Labour and the Tories on a possible election. From a Labour briefing, the BBC\u2019s Nick Watt says on Twitter that it looks like the party would need a cast iron legally binding assurance from the prime minister of an election date before backing it. If the EU grants an extension to 31 January then Labour would need a legal guarantee of election before then, he adds. Boris Johnson said earlier that the events which had come to light in Essex were \u2018truly heartbreaking,\u2019 while other MPs, including Jeremy Corbyn, also spoke about the incident and paid tribute to the emergency services. We\u2019ve got some footage of those contributions: The SNP MP Peter Grant asked the home secretary what assurances could be given to anyone with information about the case in Essex but who were afraid to come forward that they would be treated as a victim of crime. Patel described this as a really important point but that the legislation which had been put in place on modern slavery meant that there were active support measures in place and she would encourage anyone with information to come forward. Hywel Williams, a Plaid Cymru MP for Arfon, said: \u201cHolyhead is the second busiest roll on, roll off port in the United Kingdom, yet there is no permanent immigration enforcement presence at the port.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d Patel replied that she had made it clear that when it came to Border Force and checks they took place through intelligence-led operations. Because what was being dealt with in Essex was potentially an illegal criminal act she wanted to leave it to investigators to deal with. During questions to the home secretary in the House of Commons, the DUP MP Ian Paisley junior said around 39 to 40 MPs were sitting on the benches on his side of the House of Commons. One way of getting a picture of the scale of human destruction inside the lorry container in Essex was to bear that in mind. While not commenting on the specific case in Essex, he went on to urge Priti Patel to look into what he said was a broader problem of paramilitary gangs in Northern Ireland attempting to circumvent border checks and to see what additional checks were needed on the UK\u2019s existing border along Northern Ireland. John Woodcock made a call for sentencing in relation to people smuggling to be brought into line with sentences allotted in the case of murder. Unionist MPs have branded the government\u2019s approach to Northern Ireland in the Brexit talks \u201cdespicable\u201d and a \u201cbetrayal\u201d. In his first appearance before the Northern Ireland affairs select committee, Julian Smith, the Northern Ireland secretary, was questioned about plans to require businesses selling or transiting goods from the region to Britain to complete special paperwork in order to trade post-Brexit. Smith\u2019s said the checks would be minimal and the focus should be on the \u201cgreat opportunities\u201d awaiting Northern Ireland. He said the government would work with businesses to ensure the withdrawal agreement bill would as far as possible allow unfettered trade between Northern Ireland and Britain. Ian Paisley, the DUP MP for North Antrim, said it was disgraceful to expect any business to complete paperwork for goods being sold in \u201cour country, not a foreign country\u201d. In the House of Commons, the former immigration minister Damian Green has sought assurances from Priti Patel that the UK border force authorities would be able to cover not just Holyhead and other major ports but all ports around the UK. \u201cIt is going to require a defence of the whole United Kingdom if we are going to be be successful in saving lives in the future,\u201d said Green. Patel replied that there had been a \u201cgreat deal of work\u201d done on preventing people trafficking through routes such as Kent on small boats and the UK was committed to working far more collaboratively to ensure all ports are prepared. Christine Jardine, an Edinburgh Liberal Democrat MP, asked Patel to agree with her that \u201cwe have to look at our own immigration system and repair it to ensure that what we provide is fair, compassionate and effective for those who want to come here\u201d. Thanking Jardine for her comments, Patel added: \u201cI think today is not the day to be talking about an immigration system at all.\u201d \u201cWe have migration challenges that we are seeing around the world. People are being displaced in record numbers and many are being displaced and preyed upon through some of the most appalling behaviours, through criminal gangs.\u201d This is Ben Quinn picking up the liveblog now from Frances.

Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn met on Wednesday morning but failed to agree a timetable for pressing ahead with the \u201cpaused\u201d Brexit bill. Corbyn was accompanied by his key adviser Seumas Milne, and Johnson by Dominic Cummings, as well as the two parties\u2019 respective chief whips. The meeting took place in the prime minister\u2019s House of Commons office. The pair later clashed at prime minister\u2019s questions. Both said the discovery of 39 bodies in a lorry in Essex was a horrible tragedy. Labour\u2019s shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon has said that his party would back a general election if the EU grants the UK an extension to its deadline for Brexit. He told Sky news: I\u2019d like to see an election before Christmas. I want to get Boris Johnson and his Thatcherite mates out of Downing Street as soon as possible. So as soon as the EU has agreed that extension, so that Boris Johnson cannot push us through a no-deal without a mandate to do so, then we want a general election. The Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, and the European parliament\u2019s president have backed Donald Tusk\u2019s call to grant the UK government a Brexit delay up to 31 January 2020. Following a phone call between Tusk, the president of the European council, and Varadkar on Wednesday morning, the two men agreed the EU27 should agree to the request reluctantly tabled by Boris Johnson on Saturday. \u201cThe taoiseach confirmed his support for President Tusk\u2019s proposal to grant the request for an extension, which was sought by the UK,\u201d a statement from the Irish government said. David Sassoli, the European parliament president, pointed out there was only one request \u201con the table\u201d and it deserved the EU27\u2019s support. Home secretary Priti Patel has made a statement to the commons on the discovery of 39 bodies in a shipping container in Essex. She said: \u201cMy thoughts and my condolences are with the victims and their loved ones at this utterly terrible time.\u201d Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said it was a \u201cterrible tragedy, the worst of its kind\u201d. \u201cEach of the 39 will have partners, family and friends who perhaps even now don\u2019t know how their loved one died and the horrible circumstances,\u201d she said. Responding to Patel, Labour\u2019s shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said: Any death under these circumstances is truly appalling. The fact that there has been 39 reported deaths in this incident, it\u2019s a terrible tragedy, one of the worst of its kind. And each of the 39 will have partners, family and friends who perhaps even now don\u2019t know how their loved one died and the horrible circumstances \u2026 It\u2019s important to remember that these 39 poor, unfortunate people are the victims in this. They are preyed on by the greedy, the unscrupulous and people who simply have a wilful disregard for the lives of others. But we should take account of the wider context. Nobody leaves the homes on a journey like this with so much risk and fear on a whim. They often do it because they are actually desperate, they can be victims of economic privation, war, famine, catastrophic climate change. There are many adverse conditions that people are fleeing from\u2026 I would also like an assurance from the home secretary that the cooperation with the EU27 on people trafficking, which is vital to make sure these events don\u2019t happen in the future, will actually not become harder or imperilled because we are actually leaving the EU\u2026 There should be safe and legal routes for genuine refugees to make their way here. If they do not, then I fear there could be more tragedies like this. The home secretary, Priti Patel, just read a statement to the Commons on the discovery of 39 bodies in a shipping container in Essex. She said that police were called to an industrial park at 1.40am. The bodies of 38 adults and one teenager were found. The vehicle is believed to be from Bulgaria and entered the country at Holyhead. A 25-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder. I think the whole house will agree that this is a truly shocking incident. My thoughts and my condolences are with the victims and their loved ones at this utterly terrible time and I\u2019m sure the whole house will also convey their condolences at this sad time. She said the nationalities of the victims were not known, but her officials were providing all the assistance they could. Here\u2019s our story on that meeting between the prime minister and Jeremy Corbyn. Some more details are emerging about the meeting held between Corbyn and Boris Johnson this morning. The father of the house, Kenneth Clarke, says that the PM got the Commons to vote \u201cby a comfortable majority\u201d for Brexit. He says that if Johnson proceeds in a sensible way he could deliver Brexit in a month or two\u2019s time. \u201cWill my right honourable friend get over his disappointment and accept that Oct 31 is now Halloween and it is devoid of any symbolic or political content and will fade away into historical memory very rapidly,\u201d he says. He asks Johnson to table a reasonable timetable motion. Johnson says he still thinks it is in the best interests of the country to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d by 31 October. He says he is waiting for the EU to decide whether or not to grant the UK a Brexit extension. The SNP leader in Westminster says: \u201cOur parliament doesn\u2019t matter, that\u2019s what this prime minister thinks ... He wants Scotland to trust him, but how can we? \u2026 The parliament of Scotland cannot trust this prime minister.\u201d Blackford says the PM should secure an extension then \u201cbring on an election\u201d. Johnson says Blackford\u2019s support for an election is an exciting development. \u201cPerhaps he might pass some of his courage down the line [to the Labour party],\u201d he says. The SNP\u2019s Ian Blackford says that the first ministers of Scotland and Wales have joined forces to stop \u201cthis toxic Tory Brexit\u201d. He asks him to confirm that he won\u2019t allow the legislation to pass unless consent is given by the Scottish parliament. Johnson says that the Scottish parliament has no role in approving the deal \u2013 it is up to the members of the Westminster parliament. Johnson asks him to back a general election. Corbyn says: Northern Ireland will remain on single market rules within the EU on goods and agricultural products, the rest of the UK will not \u2026 It does create a very real border down the Irish sea, something he said in terms to a DUP conference he would never do, and it wasn\u2019t that long ago. Johnson says the UK is preserved \u201cwhole and entire\u201d in the deal and the whole of the UK will be allowed to come out of the EU customs union. \u201cThere will be no checks between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. There will be no tariffs between Northern Ireland and Great Britain because we have protected the customs union.\u201d He attacks Corbyn\u2019s defence of the union again, citing \u201chis support of the IRA\u201d, and his support for a second independence referendum in Scotland. Corbyn says the deal damages the fabric of the union. Johnson says it\u2019s a bit rich to hear from the Labour leader about his \u201csentimental attachment\u201d to the union when he has spend most of his political lifetime supporting the IRA. Corbyn says: I hate it to break it to the prime minister, but under his government and that of his predecessor privatisation has more than doubled to \u00a310bn in our NHS. There are currently 20 NHS contracts out to tender. And when he\u2019s promised 40 hospitals, he then reduced that to 20 and then it turns out reconfiguration is taking place in just six hospitals. Johnson says Corbyn is completely wrong in his assessment of privatisation in the NHS. He says the 47,000 extra clinical staff he\u2019s promised were paid for from public funds and that was possible because the Tories believe in sound management of the economy. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that the right honourable gentleman has no other purpose in seeking to frustrate Brexit than to cause a second referendum,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cI must say I find it peculiar that [Corbyn] now wants this bill back because he voted against it last night and he whipped his entire Labour party against it,\u201d says Johnson. Corbyn says the prime minister has not answered his question on workers\u2019 rights and that the provisions in the Brexit bill offer no real protections. Johnson says it was a remarkable thing that so many MPs approved the second reading of the Brexit bill last night, but a great shame that they voted for a delay. Jeremy Corbyn stands up and expresses his own remorse for those who were found dead in Essex. \u201cThis is an unbelievable human tragedy that happened in our country at this time,\u201d he says. He says we should think about what inhumanity is done to other human beings. Corbyn goes on to say that yesterday the prime minister \u201cdecided to delay his own withdrawal bill\u201d. Predictably, Tory MPs don\u2019t like that interpretation of events. Johnson opens with the horrible news that 39 bodies have been found in a lorry in Essex. He says it is an awful tragedy. Labour MP Rupa Huq asks him why he doesn\u2019t get rid of Dominic Cummings. Johnson says he receives excellent advice from his advisers and he takes full responsibility for everything the government does. Boris Johnson is in his place for prime minister\u2019s questions. My colleague Daniel Avelar and I will bring you updates when he starts speaking. The EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has said the EU27 need some clarification on what the UK will do next, before they decide on another Brexit extension. This is from the Times\u2019s political editor, Francis Elliott: The shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon, said this morning that the withdrawal agreement would take \u201ca couple of weeks\u201d to debate, not months. \u201cI don\u2019t think three months will be required to discuss the bill,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cI would have thought it can be done in a matter of weeks, but it\u2019s not for me to decide. The reality is, what was put forward was completely insufficient.\u201d You can see a reminder here of what exactly a programme motion is \u2013 The first minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, and the first minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, are holding a press conference in Westminster to set out the Welsh and Scottish governments\u2019 position on the Brexit withdrawal bill. Guardian political correspondent Peter Walker is there tweeting. In comments briefed ahead of the conference, Sturgeon said: The UK government has sought to pass the withdrawal bill through Westminster without an opportunity for detailed scrutiny in either the UK or Scottish parliaments. That is unacceptable. It is imperative that this bill is subject to detailed scrutiny in all of the UK\u2019s legislatures and that the views of the Scottish parliament and Welsh assembly are taken into account. The European parliament, which doesn\u2019t have a say over the decision, has also come out in support of an extension until 31 January. President of the European parliament, David Sassoli, said: After the vote of the British parliament to allow more time to examine details of the withdrawal agreement and Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to pause the bill following the vote, the British government\u2019s request for an extension until January 31 remains on the table. I think it is advisable, as requested by President Donald Tusk, that the European council should accept this extension. This extension will allow the United Kingdom to clarify its position and the European parliament to exercise its role. Donald Tusk, president of the European council, tweeted last night that he would recommend the EU27 accept the UK request for an extension. Here is a story from the Guardian\u2019s Brussels bureau chief, Daniel Boffey: The Irish taoiseach (prime minister), Leo Varadkar, has hinted that a Brexit extension to 31 January is the panacea to the latest impasse to hit Boris Johnson\u2019s deal. He spoke to the European council president, Donald Tusk, today and they \u201cnoted\u201d that an extension to the end of January would not prohibit an earlier departure from the bloc. The issue will be discussed at a key meeting in Brussels tonight. Here\u2019s the full statement from the Irish government: An Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, spoke with the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, this morning regarding the UK\u2019s request for an extension. The Taoiseach confirmed his support for President Tusk\u2019s proposal to grant the request for an extension which was sought by the UK. They noted that it would still be possible for the UK to leave before January 31st 2020 if the Withdrawal Agreement has been ratified in advance of that date. The matter is likely to be discussed further at tonight\u2019s meeting of the Committee of Permanent Representatives in Brussels. More from Lisa O\u2019Carroll, who is watching Northern Ireland secretary Julian Smith giving evidence at the Northern Ireland affairs committee. Anti-Brexit activist Gina Miller has been making the case for a general election \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. Nigel Farage has told the BBC that a general election is now the \u201conly possible route to get some resolution\u201d. The Brexit party leader said: Obviously what they want is a general election or a second referendum - they want some degree of resolution. So I would have thought at least until the end of January, perhaps even longer. On an electoral pact, he said: I would work with anybody that wanted to honour the result of the referendum for us to leave the European Union and to leave its institutions and to be an independent country, but right at the moment that looks very unlikely. Guardian readers have reacted to last night\u2019s developments in the commons. \u201cThis may seal Boris\u2019s fate. The EU looks [prepared] to grant the extension now because there will be nothing to stop the vote of no confidence and a GE [general election],\u201d said one. \u201cThe outcome of that is obviously uncertain, but in this situation, risks have to be taken to try to avert catastrophe.\u201d Boris Johnson has issued a short statement about the 39 people who were found dead in a lorry container in Essex. Guardian Brexit correspondent, Lisa O\u2019Carroll, is following the Northern Ireland select committee. The Northern Ireland secretary Julian Smith is giving evidence at the Northern Ireland affairs committee. He said the government would be doing anything they could make any checks on goods moving between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK as \u201creduced and limited as possible\u201d. Smith said we now have a deal where Northern Ireland is out of the European Union. A reminder of what we have to look forward to in the commons today. Proceedings kick off with questions to the cabinet office minister Michael Gove at 11.30am, before prime minister\u2019s questions at midday. Since the progress of the withdrawal agreement bill has been paused, the queen\u2019s speech is back on the agenda. MPs will debate it this afternoon, with a special focus on the NHS. From the former chancellor \u2013 Good point here from the Guardian\u2019s diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour. Speaker John Bercow said he would stand down by 31 October. Former Conservative deputy prime minister Michael Heseltine has been speaking to Sky News. Asked whether he thought the Tories would win an election, he said: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d The issue is can the Brexit aspect of the Tory party peel off enough Labour votes, enough Labour marginal constituencies, to counter the number that the Tories are going to lose. They are going to lose seats in Scotland and seats to the Lib Dems. I think they have alienated the Irish to such an extent that they won\u2019t come back and support them, so you can see quite clearly where the Tories are going to lose seats. And I know where they think they can win Labour seats, but when it comes to it that\u2019s a pretty big gamble. My own guess is that a general election will be a re-run of what we have today \u2013 another period of uncertainty. He said an election might put Johnson back in No 10, but without a majority. Here are the full Burgon quotes from Sky News \u2013 I\u2019d like to see an election before Christmas. I want to get Boris Johnson and his Thatcherite mates out of Downing Street as soon as possible. So as soon as the EU has agreed that extension, so that Boris Johnson cannot push us through a no-deal without a mandate to do so, then we want a general election. Not only to get Brexit sorted by under a Labour government putting it to a public vote between a credible leave option and remain, but also sorting out all the other crises that the Tories have caused in the last nine years in government, whether it be housing, jobs, public services or austerity. Former Conservative and now independent MP Ken Clarke has told BBC News that the narrative on last night\u2019s debate has been spun by \u201cthese strange people that Boris has put in Downing Street\u201d (aka Dominic Cummings). He said parliament voted by a clear majority in favour of leaving the European Union with a deal. \u201cThe only thing that was killed off was the idea that it had to be on halloween,\u201d he said. It\u2019s always been a mystery to me why that date has been given a sacred significance. It\u2019s a completely unimportant date. It was plucked out of the air last time the eurosceptics caused delay and stopped us leaving twice earlier this year and it has no significance. Clarke said that even ministers were still discovering yesterday what the deal in its present form actually means. He said the Brexit secretary found out yesterday that, as it stands, the deal requires customs documents for all goods that pass between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. \u201cThings like that have got to be sorted out,\u201d he said. \u201cParliament is not defying the people, it is just insisting that we have something that is sensible and works and is practical.\u201d Asked about the idea that \u201cparliament is broken\u201d, Clarke says: \u201cThis bloke in Downing Street (Cummings) keeps saying that. Even Boris has not said that ... The government has just got the second reading of its bill.\u201d Richard Burgon has been clear about Labour\u2019s position when speaking to Sky news. The Lord chancellor and justice secretary Robert Buckland has been speaking to Sky news. Asked why the government wouldn\u2019t just allow parliament to debate the withdrawal agreement bill for a bit, he says that the EU chose the 31 October deadline date and that we should respect that. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to give up and walk away and pretend that this is too difficult,\u201d he said. Labour\u2019s justice secretary Richard Burgon has been speaking to the BBC. He said more time was needed for the government and the opposition to discuss a sensible way forward. He refused to put an exact number of days on how long was needed to examine a withdrawal agreement bill, saying it didn\u2019t make a difference to people if it was debated for two or two and a half weeks. Burgon said it was the government who is allowing the matter to drag on \u2013 One of the reasons it\u2019s dragging on is because the government is putting a stop to the progression of the bill. The second reason was passed in parliament \u2013 though we voted against it \u2013 but the government isn\u2019t proceeding with it at the moment. They could be. So actually it\u2019s the government who are behaving in a strange way, not the other political parties. But we need to get this sorted. Burgon dodged the question of whether Labour would back an election if the EU granted the UK an extension. This is from ITV\u2019s political correspondent \u2013 Former attorney general Dominic Grieve has been speaking on Sky news. Grieve said that the fixed-term parliaments act 2011 \u2013 which makes it harder for a prime minister to call a general election at a time that is convenient for them \u2013 was a terrible piece of legislation, which he regrets. Former Tory culture secretary John Whittingdale, appearing on Sky just now, said he agreed with Grieve on the fixed-term parliaments act. He said that the 31 October deadline would probably be missed. I think Boris has pulled off an extraordinary achievement. Not only did he manage to get the EU to reopen the deal and make the changes necessary for people like me to support it, he then managed to get it through the House of Commons. Stephen Kinnock from Labour said that while he was open to voting for a deal, he couldn\u2019t vote for this one which \u201cwould make a bonfire of workers rights, environmental standards and consumer protection\u201d. He said that the prime minister should sit down with Corbyn and agree a sensible programme motion so the bill could be scrutinised and amended. \u201cI have huge respect for colleagues who too the decision to vote last night in the way that they did. It simply wasn\u2019t a deal I could support,\u201d he said. David Lidington, a former Tory Europe minister, was just on the BBC\u2019s Today programme. He said that the EU would want to ensure that they don\u2019t get blamed for a no-deal Brexit, so will offer an extension. He said the majority for the withdrawal agreement bill was bigger than most people had expected and that the government should propose a longer timetable to try and get it through parliament again. \u201cI see no way that the October 31st deadline can be met anyway now the bill has been paused in the commons,\u201d he said. I think the fear in Downing street is partly of rafts of amendments to the bill, but also about the difficulty of governing without a majority ... There are broader questions that underly the disputes about the timings of the Brexit bill Lidington said the most likely timing for an election was the end of November or early December, though he warned that the public would not welcome an election in the run-up to Christmas. It\u2019s Frances Perraudin here now, taking over from Kate Lyons. You can contact me on @fperraudin or below the line. An unpleasant start to the day for Lisa Nandy, Labour MP for Wigan. Peter Walker has this extremely helpful Q&amp;A in which he answers some key questions. The full article is here and a selection of answers are below: So what just happened? In brief: the bill seeking to put into law Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal was passed by MPs on its second reading, the initial opportunity that MPs have to vote on a bill. It passed by 329 votes to 299, the first time the Commons has formally approved a Brexit plan. However, only 20 minutes later, MPs rejected the government\u2019s so-called programme motion, which set out the accelerated timetable for the bill, by 308 votes in favour to 322 against. So what happens now? Under a backbench-instigated law intended to ward off a no-deal Brexit, Johnson wrote to the EU on Saturday to formally request a delay to departure until 31 January, despite the PM not wanting this to happen. Responding in the Commons, Johnson said he would \u201cpause this legislation\u201d and await information from the EU on a possible delay. In the interim, he said, no-deal preparations would be ramped up. For now, the bill is \u201cin limbo\u201d, Speaker John Bercow said, using what he said was the technical term. Is the bill getting pulled? Downing Street had strongly hinted this would be the response to losing the programme motion. However, this seems to have been a lever to pressure MPs into backing the motion. Speaking during the debate ahead of the votes, Johnson pledged he would pull the bill and seek an election in the event of a delay until January or longer. But he did not promise to do this in any circumstances, holding open the possibility of a brief delay being acceptable. After the vote, Johnson was similarly equivocal, saying: \u201cOne way or another, we will leave the EU with this deal.\u201d Does all this make a general election more likely? Probably. If the EU insists on a lengthy delay, which is put in place, Johnson could push for an election. Crucially, if an imminent no-deal Brexit was now averted, Labour would be expected to now back an election, making it happen. However, for all his protestations against a longer delay, the 30-vote majority for his Brexit deal could tempt Johnson into trying to push the bill through parliament before an election, allowing him to stand as the prime minister who delivered departure. What will MPs do for the rest of this week? On Wednesday and Thursday, when they should have been finishing off the stages of the WAB, they will instead return to debating the Queen\u2019s speech. Remember that? The government\u2019s planned legislative programme was presented on Monday last week, but the scheduled five-day debate was suspended for the WAB debate. It now comes back. But it\u2019s hard to beat the Sun\u2019s front page today. Most of today\u2019s papers \u2013 whose fronts pages we round up here \u2013 blame Parliament for the latest sting in the Brexit tale. Here is a selection: This from the Brexit coordinator for the European Parliament Hello and welcome to the politics blog, bringing you the latest out of Westminster and Brussels in the wake of Tuesday night\u2019s partial victory in the Commons for Boris Johnson. Here\u2019s a very brief summary of events to get you started: Donald Tusk has said he will recommend the EU 27 leaders accept Johnson\u2019s somewhat reluctant request for a Brexit extension. He made the request as soon as MPs rejected the PM\u2019s three-day timetable to push through his deal. Downing Street will have to decide whether to carry through with the PM\u2019s threat to abandon the bill and call for a general election in the event of a lengthy extension. Here is a video of his speech. Note: he dropped the threat after losing the second vote, but No 10 is still making noises about it in the event of an extension until January. However, an EU source said that if the bloc was to think again on the length of the extension then Johnson would need to make a second formal request for a shorter delay. Jeremy Corbyn has urged the government to agree to an alternative timetable, to allow the legislation to continue to be debated. I\u2019ll be gently steering us through these choppy news waters during the early hours before handing over to my esteemed and highly entertaining colleagues.

Breeders also mix dogs with desirable traits from different breeds. It started when Wally Conron joined a labrador and a poodle in the 1980s to create a guide dog that had the right temperament to escort a person with impaired vision but didn\u2019t trigger allergic reactions.</p> <p>Since the offspring from this mating were creatively dubbed \u201clabradoodles\u201d, the craze for designer mongrels with comical names has taken off. A survey by Petsure has found the number of designer crossbreed dogs being registered for insurance <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jul/06/owners-urged-to-snub-fashion-as-high-cost-of-flat-faced-dogs-revealed\">is on the rise</a> in Australia. In the US, the American Canine Hybrid Club has registered<a href=\"http://www.achclub.com/index2.html\"> 151 new hybrid breeds</a><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20090204120138/http://www.achclub.com/modules.php?name=Breeders\"> in the last decade</a>, with 711 currently listed. Now we have bullypits (American pit bull terrier x bull dog) morkies (Maltese x yorkies), doxiepoos (dachshund x poodle), puggles (beagle x pug), dalmadoodles (dalmatian x poodle) and peke-a-pins (miniature pinscher x Pekingese). <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/sep/26/labradoodle-inventor-lifes-regret-frankenstein-monster\">Conron is not happy about it.</a></p> <p>He may have started a craze, but did his experiment to produce a hypoallergenic guide dog actually work?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jul/06/owners-urged-to-snub-fashion-as-high-cost-of-flat-faced-dogs-revealed\">Owners urged to snub fashion as high cost of flat-faced dogs revealed</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2019-09-23/labradoodle-guide-dogs-designer-regret/10717186\">According to the ABC</a>, he sent hair and saliva samples from the labradoodle pups to their potential owner\u2019s husband \u2013 who was allergic to dogs \u2013 in Hawaii to test if he reacted to them. Only one dog \u2013 Sultan \u2013 didn\u2019t elicit any allergic symptoms, and he became the world\u2019s first labradoodle guide dog.</p> <p>As far as dogs that are marketed as hypoallergenic today, despite some breeders\u2019 claims, research support is lacking. In fact, a 2012 study found <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674912007932\">no evidence</a> of it when comparing \u201chypoallergenic\u201d breeds including poodles and labradoodles with labrador retrievers and a control group. Anecdotally, though, people have reported less reactions to certain breeds. For instance, Dr <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/profiles/susan-hazel-402495\">Susan Hazel</a>, lecturer in the University of Adelaide\u2019s School of Animal and Veterinary Science, says her partner\u2019s granddaughter was allergic to their previous dog but was fine when they opted for a poodle.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4420f3cfde0f3a52304e6bb74b425c9a65c04a99\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4420f3cfde0f3a52304e6bb74b425c9a65c04a99/0_236_1200_1433/837.jpg\" alt=\"A labradoodle \u2013 a labrador and poodle crossbreed that is said to be better for allergy sufferers\" width=\"837\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A labradoodle \u2013 a labrador and poodle crossbreed that is said to be better for allergy sufferers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hydrangea/Wikipedia</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So, crossbreeding doesn\u2019t guarantee a dog that is better for an allergic owner\u2019s health \u2013 but what about the dogs themselves? It\u2019s complicated.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.instituteofcaninebiology.org/blog/coi-faqs-understanding-the-coefficient-of-inbreeding\">Breeding purebreds</a> can create the predictable, desirable traits associated with specific breeds \u2013 like the easy going and affectionate nature of <a href=\"https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever#/slide/1\">goldens</a> \u2013 but it can <a href=\"https://www.instituteofcaninebiology.org/blog/coi-faqs-understanding-the-coefficient-of-inbreeding\">reduce genetic diversity</a> and hence vitality and survival.</p> <p>As a general rule, the offspring of two different species or breeds has greater genetic diversity, creating <a href=\"https://www.scienceabc.com/nature/what-is-hybrid-vigor-definition-examples-and-a-brief-explanation.html\">hybrid vigour</a> \u2013 enhanced fertility, health and survival. However, when, say, a labradoodle, is produced, mating it with another labradoodle is comparable to joining two dogs from the same breed, and genetic diversity is once again reduced. To keep any hybrid vigour going, you need to keep mating the original two breeds.</p> <p>But while the UK Kennel Club has been <a href=\"https://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/getting-a-dog-or-puppy/finding-the-right-dog/crossbreed-dogs/\">registering crossbreeds</a> on its database for more than 50 years, record-keeping of their parentage has been <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27387730\">lacking</a>, making it difficult for scientists to assess their hybrid vigour.</p> <p>\u201cAt the moment, when veterinarians or anybody else classifies a crossbred dog they just call it a crossbred dog,\u201d says <a href=\"https://sydney.edu.au/science/people/frank.nicholas.php\">Frank Nicholas</a>, emeritus professor of animal genetics at the University of Sydney. \u201cThe prediction is that there will be some [hybrid vigour], based on <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090023316300673\">extrapolating from other species</a>, but the evidence really is frustratingly lacking at the moment.\u201d</p> <p>Nicholas <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090023316300673\">identified</a> just three studies in dogs with clear data on their lineage. Two found enhanced behavioural outcomes when crossing a labrador with a golden retriever, producing a better guide dog, but one found a detrimental impact of mating a lab-golden cross with a poodle. The latter offspring had greater risk of a <a href=\"https://www.bva.co.uk/uploadedFiles/Content/Canine_Health_Schemes/20160321%20CHS%20Eye%20leaflet%202016%20v8A.pdf\">hereditary eye disease</a> than their respective purebred lines. But due to tainted data overall, Nicholas stresses the importance of keeping careful records so canine hybrid vigour can be scrutinised.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a0baa80fcee5aa89cb7aa7da8f67c7128916c09\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a0baa80fcee5aa89cb7aa7da8f67c7128916c09/0_0_850_1500/567.jpg\" alt=\"A cockapoo, which is mix between a cocker spaniel and poodle.\" width=\"567\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A cockapoo, which is mix between a cocker spaniel and poodle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luke Truicko/Wikipedia</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hybrid vigour is the \u201cmirror image\u201d of <a href=\"https://cosmosmagazine.com/biology/chips-off-the-old-block-most-potatoes-suffer-depression\">inbreeding depression</a>, Nicholas <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090023316300673\">writes</a>, weakening of certain features as a result of excessive breeding with close relatives. Everyone carries deleterious genes that have mutated, and the more closely parents are related, the more likely these mutations are to appear and become more concentrated down the bloodline \u2013 like the European <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3716267/\">royal dynasties</a> who proliferated haemophilia within their exclusive circles.

      "bodyText": "It would take a hard heart not to melt at the beseeching brown eyes, soft, floppy caramel ears and white paws of Ollie, the dorgi. What\u2019s a dorgi, you say? It\u2019s a corgi crossed with a dachshund, who \u2013 like many of our contemporary four-legged friends \u2013 even has his own Instagram page. Someone bred two cute types of dog together to create a hybrid that\u2019s even more adorable. Cute factor isn\u2019t the only reason to crossbreed. Breeders also mix dogs with desirable traits from different breeds. It started when Wally Conron joined a labrador and a poodle in the 1980s to create a guide dog that had the right temperament to escort a person with impaired vision but didn\u2019t trigger allergic reactions. Since the offspring from this mating were creatively dubbed \u201clabradoodles\u201d, the craze for designer mongrels with comical names has taken off. A survey by Petsure has found the number of designer crossbreed dogs being registered for insurance is on the rise in Australia. In the US, the American Canine Hybrid Club has registered 151 new hybrid breeds in the last decade, with 711 currently listed. Now we have bullypits (American pit bull terrier x bull dog) morkies (Maltese x yorkies), doxiepoos (dachshund x poodle), puggles (beagle x pug), dalmadoodles (dalmatian x poodle) and peke-a-pins (miniature pinscher x Pekingese). Conron is not happy about it. He may have started a craze, but did his experiment to produce a hypoallergenic guide dog actually work? According to the ABC, he sent hair and saliva samples from the labradoodle pups to their potential owner\u2019s husband \u2013 who was allergic to dogs \u2013 in Hawaii to test if he reacted to them. Only one dog \u2013 Sultan \u2013 didn\u2019t elicit any allergic symptoms, and he became the world\u2019s first labradoodle guide dog. As far as dogs that are marketed as hypoallergenic today, despite some breeders\u2019 claims, research support is lacking. In fact, a 2012 study found no evidence of it when comparing \u201chypoallergenic\u201d breeds including poodles and labradoodles with labrador retrievers and a control group. Anecdotally, though, people have reported less reactions to certain breeds. For instance, Dr Susan Hazel, lecturer in the University of Adelaide\u2019s School of Animal and Veterinary Science, says her partner\u2019s granddaughter was allergic to their previous dog but was fine when they opted for a poodle. So, crossbreeding doesn\u2019t guarantee a dog that is better for an allergic owner\u2019s health \u2013 but what about the dogs themselves? It\u2019s complicated. Breeding purebreds can create the predictable, desirable traits associated with specific breeds \u2013 like the easy going and affectionate nature of goldens \u2013 but it can reduce genetic diversity and hence vitality and survival. As a general rule, the offspring of two different species or breeds has greater genetic diversity, creating hybrid vigour \u2013 enhanced fertility, health and survival. However, when, say, a labradoodle, is produced, mating it with another labradoodle is comparable to joining two dogs from the same breed, and genetic diversity is once again reduced. To keep any hybrid vigour going, you need to keep mating the original two breeds. But while the UK Kennel Club has been registering crossbreeds on its database for more than 50 years, record-keeping of their parentage has been lacking, making it difficult for scientists to assess their hybrid vigour. \u201cAt the moment, when veterinarians or anybody else classifies a crossbred dog they just call it a crossbred dog,\u201d says Frank Nicholas, emeritus professor of animal genetics at the University of Sydney. \u201cThe prediction is that there will be some [hybrid vigour], based on extrapolating from other species, but the evidence really is frustratingly lacking at the moment.\u201d Nicholas identified just three studies in dogs with clear data on their lineage. Two found enhanced behavioural outcomes when crossing a labrador with a golden retriever, producing a better guide dog, but one found a detrimental impact of mating a lab-golden cross with a poodle. The latter offspring had greater risk of a hereditary eye disease than their respective purebred lines. But due to tainted data overall, Nicholas stresses the importance of keeping careful records so canine hybrid vigour can be scrutinised. Hybrid vigour is the \u201cmirror image\u201d of inbreeding depression, Nicholas writes, weakening of certain features as a result of excessive breeding with close relatives. Everyone carries deleterious genes that have mutated, and the more closely parents are related, the more likely these mutations are to appear and become more concentrated down the bloodline \u2013 like the European royal dynasties who proliferated haemophilia within their exclusive circles. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important for humans \u2013 and pedigree dogs like labradors and golden retrievers \u2013 to keep relations with sisters and cousins platonic. Mind you, this isn\u2019t a huge problem in dogs, according to Nicholas. \u201cI mean there is some mating of close relatives,\u201d he says, \u201cbut it\u2019s not as big a deal as what it\u2019s made out to be.\u201d A bigger problem is the sad fate of pedigrees bred for desirable qualities that damage their health, like the cute flat faces and short skulls of pugs, French bulldogs and Cavalier King Charles spaniels that constrict their breathing. This isn\u2019t an issue for hybrid dogs that don\u2019t have health-threatening breed standards \u2013 although if you cross a pug with a Frenchie you will likely end up with a dog that struggles to get air into its lungs. Purebreds also have more than 300 genetically inherited defects. Fortunately, most of these come from autosomal recessive genes. In purebred dogs, like in humans, both parents have to carry the recessive gene for their offspring to have a chance of inheriting the defect. So it\u2019s highly improbable that hybrids will, although they\u2019re not completely off the hook \u2013 some traits are carried by different breeds, such as hip dysplasia, a common disorder in labradors, goldens and other large dogs. Crossbreeding does have its own dark side. Designer pooches with fancy names are a marketable commodity that ruthless breeders exploit. Hazel says they can even be more expensive than purebred dogs. And, \u201cif people are in it just for the profit, the risk is the welfare of the animals\u201d, she says. Puppy farms \u2013 which usually service pet shops \u2013 are a heartbreaking manifestation of this, where dogs become breeding machines as soon as they reach reproductive age. According to the RSPCA, puppies and mums aren\u2019t given enough food, water, grooming or exercise and miss out on affection and play. Added to unhygienic conditions like floors covered in faeces and urine, they end up mentally and physically sick, yet untreated. They are \u201cliterally being \u2018bred to death\u2019\u201d. Illegitimate breeders also don\u2019t do the genetic testing required to ensure healthy offspring that don\u2019t carry inherited diseases \u2013 whether pure- or cross-bred. Even legitimate breeders can\u2019t create the perfect dog.

      "bodyText": "A 17-year-old girl was among more than 20 Extinction Rebellion activists strip-searched in the Brisbane City police watch house recently during a week of climate protests. On 9 October, the third day of Extinction Rebellion civil disobedience, a protester had brought a phone undetected into her cell at the watch house and livestreamed video for about 15 minutes to a private Facebook page. Police warned the woman she would be strip-searched if she was arrested again, but responded the following day by repeatedly searching, then strip-searching, every activist arrested. One of those activists, a 17-year-old girl, told Guardian Australia she had questioned police about whether they had the right to search her. \u201cI said I\u2019m 17, can you strip-search me?\u201d the girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said. \u201cThey said actually it doesn\u2019t matter. \u201cIt was done in a private room at the watch house ... the thing is when you\u2019re in the watch house it\u2019s already dehumanising, you lose all your right to any dignity. It\u2019s not great, it really isn\u2019t.\u201d Strip-searches of young music festivalgoers and environmental activists could wake up middle-class Australians to a practice that routinely affects the poor, Indigenous and disadvantaged, a leading advocate for the rights of prisoners has said. Debbie Kilroy, the founder of the organisation Sisters Inside, likened the practice of strip-searching to \u201csexual assault by the state\u201d. \u201cIf I did that to you, or you did that to me in the street, we\u2019d be facing serious criminal charges,\u201d Kilroy said. \u201cSo why do we allow it to happen in prisons and watch houses?\u201d Her comments come after revelations in the NSW Law Enforcement Conduct Commission that police strip-searches, including searches on a 16-year-old girl at the Splendour in the Grass music festival, may have been illegal. Kilroy has been campaigning for a decade to end the practice in prisons and police custody. She says where some might be shocked to hear about minors being subjected to strip-searches, the reality is that they are used by authorities on a daily basis. \u201cIt\u2019s predominantly Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who are criminalised, it\u2019s predominantly very poor people, it\u2019s homeless people, it\u2019s people with mental illness,\u201d Kilroy said. \u201cThey already know what the experience is like. \u201cThe more we see young people and people on the streets protesting \u2026 there\u2019s going to be more and more people exposed to police brutality. We\u2019re going to see middle- and upper-class people on the streets who are concerned about the climate crisis. We are seeing already laws enacted to criminalise them. \u201cNow the middle class is being targeted by the expansion of laws to control them and gag them. Their eyes are going to be opened by this. The experience will connect the divide.\u201d Kilroy said the way certain groups are criminalised or viewed with automatic suspicion feeds into decisions by authorities to conduct searches, which they can do lawfully where they have reasonable suspicion. \u201cIn prison, if you come to prison for whatever reason, there\u2019s an automatic suspicion. Across the country in prisons it\u2019s a common practice. Based on their own statistics, it actually doesn\u2019t uncover the contraband and the weapons. That\u2019s actually a myth. It\u2019s about social control and the further sexual assault of women by the state. \u201cWe know the high numbers of women and girls who are sexually abused or raped. These women get strip-searched in a way that is retraumatising them, clothes ripped off them or cut off them. \u201cIf you\u2019re menstruating you have to remove your tampon or your pad and hand that over. \u201cThese women [might] try to protect themselves, but police put it in a frame where they\u2019re attacking police, but they\u2019re actually trying to protect themselves and stop being violated. \u201cThis is nothing but sexual assault by the state by prison officers [and police] who do this day in day out.\u201d Kilroy said the practice happened at prisons which had airport-style scanners that could easily be used to replace invasive searches. Several Extinction Rebellion activists spoke with Guardian Australia about being strip-searched after being arrested on the Thursday of Rebellion Week. Each said they had already been throughly pat-down searched by police before arriving at the watch house. \u201cIt was a full pat down, right up under my bra, in all my pockets, there was no way they could have missed anything,\u201d said Vicki, 49, a mother and childcare worker. \u201cIt was pretty shit. It was pretty shocking because I had no understanding of why I was being strip-searched. They didn\u2019t say to me \u2018do you have anything on your body that is dangerous?\u2019\u201d Vicki and other activists said the searches seemed like a \u201cknee-jerk reaction\u201d to the embarrassment caused to police by the livestreaming, and that police had been unnecessarily aggressive to people who posed no threat. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to hurt people, our biggest thing is we\u2019re non-violent protesters. Police are responding to peaceful protesters with violence.\u201d Police said in a statement the safety and security of people in custody, watch house staff and support agencies was paramount. \u201cWhen a person is admitted to a watch house they are searched according to legislation, policy, procedures and information known to police,\u201d the statement said. \u201cPeople are searched by an officer of the same sex in a private section to maintain the dignity of the person being searched. \u201cChildren are searched according to the same standards however a higher threshold is applied in acknowledgement of a child\u2019s vulnerability.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions will stop rising and gradually start to fall over the next three years as the country feels the effects of the recent renewable energy boom, engineering researchers say. Academics from the Australian National University estimate national emissions will dip by 3%-4% by 2022, ending the year-on-year increases recorded since the abolition of the carbon price scheme. But they found deeper emissions cuts through the 2020s to meet the target set under the Paris climate agreement would depend on the federal and, to a lesser extent, state governments supporting further expansion of solar and wind by ensuring adequate new electricity transmission and storage. Andrew Blakers, a professor of engineering, said a policy briefing published on Thursday, co-authored with colleague Matthew Stocks, was a \u201cmessage of hope\u201d about reducing pollution at lowest cost. \u201cSolar and wind energy offers the cheapest way to make deep cuts in emissions because of their low and continually falling cost,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the renewable energy pipeline is stopped or slowed because of insufficient transmission and storage, then emissions may rise again from 2022.\u201d While the call for improved transmission is near universal, Blakers and Stocks differ from most energy experts in placing relatively little weight on the need for government policy to continue to drive what has been a surge in clean energy investment since 2017. The current boom is largely driven by the 2020 federal renewable energy target. It led to nearly 3.5 gigawatts of capacity being built last year, three times more than the year before. But the target, equivalent to about 23% of national electricity demand, has now been met, the Morrison government has not replaced it and there is evidence investment has slowed. A growing number of businesses have signed renewable energy contracts independent of government support, but many analysts say the boom is unlikely to continue without a policy with bipartisan political support to drive the transformation to a cleaner grid. Blakers said clean technology was so cheap that adequate government support for transmission and storage would be enough to deliver 50% renewable energy by 2024 and 75% by 2030.

Labor\u2019s shadow agriculture minister, Joel Fitzgibbon, called on the government not to \u201crun up the white flag on our farmers\u201d, calling for more financial assistance rather than funding for exit payments. \u201cThe National Farmers\u2019 Federation has declared it is all too hard and I don\u2019t accept that,\u201d Fitzgibbon said. \u201cWhen farmers are struggling and they\u2019re dealing with the psychological impact, they don\u2019t want to hear the National Farmers\u2019 Federation, they don\u2019t want to hear Barnaby Joyce say they should just get out of the business.\u201d Mike Guerin, from the Queensland agriculture group Agforce, said he expected only a small number of farmers to take up exit payments if they were offered by the commonwealth but said it was a welcome initiative. \u201cTo allow those that would like to leave with dignity to do so I think is an important thing to do,\u201d Guerin told Guardian Australia. \u201cBut we have a sense that it would only be a small percentage that would take it up \u2026it wouldn\u2019t be a wholesale walkout.\u201d NSW Farmers Drought Taskforce chairman, Wayne Dunford, said he thought exit payments might help struggling farmers who were working with financial counsellors make the difficult decision to leave the land with some financial assistance. \u201cIt could be the thing that helps them make that decision,\u201d Dunford said. But he said that the most important measure needed for communities suffering from the extended drought was a \u201ccash injection\u201d, and said he supported the NFF\u2019s call for council rate relief. Exit packages for farmers have previously been offered by the federal government, with an \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d exit payment announced by the Howard government in 2007 taken up by only 138 individuals. The Productivity Commission recommended the payments be scrapped, finding that there was low uptake of the packages because of the grant\u2019s strict eligibility requirements and a failure to address the non-monetary reasons why many farmers remained on the farm.

On 13 October, Kurdish leaders agreed to allow Syrian regime forces to enter some cities to protect them from being captured by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey\">Turkey</a>&nbsp;and its allies. The deal effectively hands over control of huge swathes of the region to Damascus.</p>\n    <p>That leaves north-eastern&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria\">Syria</a>&nbsp;divided between Syrian regime forces, Syrian opposition militia and their Turkish allies, and areas still held by the SDF \u2013 for now.</p>\n    <p>On 17 October Turkish president,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan\">Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan</a>, agreed with US vice-president Mike Pence, to suspend Ankara\u2019s operation for&nbsp; five days in order to allow Kurdish troops to withdraw. The following week, on 22 October, Erdo\u011fan and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/22/turkey-and-russia-agree-deal-over-buffer-zone-in-northern-syria\">agreed on the parameters of the proposed Turkish \u201csafe zone\u201d</a> in Syria.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How did the SDF come to control the region?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Before the SDF was formed in 2015, the Kurds had created their own militias who mobilised during the Syrian civil war to defend Kurdish cities and villages and carve out what they hoped would eventually at least become a semi-autonomous province.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>In late 2014, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/20/turkey-iraqi-kurds-kobani-isis-fighters-us-air-drops-arms\">Kurds were struggling</a>&nbsp;to fend off an Islamic State siege of Kobane, a major city under their control. With US support, including arms and airstrikes, the Kurds managed to beat back Isis and went on to win a string of victories against the radical militant group. Along the way the fighters absorbed non-Kurdish groups, changed their name to the SDF and grew to include 60,000 soldiers.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why does Turkey oppose the Kurds?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>For years, Turkey has watched the growing ties between the US and SDF with alarm. Significant numbers of the Kurds in the SDF were also members of the People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG), an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK) that has fought an insurgency against the Turkish state for more than 35 years in which as many as 40,000 people have died. The PKK initially called for independence and now demands greater autonomy for Kurds inside&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey\">Turkey</a>.</p>\n    <p>Turkey claims the PKK has continued to wage war on the Turkish state, even as it has assisted in the fight against Isis. The PKK is listed as a terrorist group by Turkey, the US, the UK, Nato and others and this has proved awkward for the US and its allies, who have chosen to downplay the SDF\u2019s links to the PKK, preferring to focus on their shared objective of defeating Isis.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are Turkey\u2019s objectives on its southern border?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Turkey aims firstly to push the SDF away from its border, creating a 20-mile (32km) buffer zone that would have been jointly patrolled by Turkish and US troops until Trump\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/07/us-withdrawal-from-syria-leaves-fate-of-isis-fighters-and-families-in-detention-uncertain\">recent announcement</a>&nbsp;that American soldiers would withdraw from the region.</p>\n    <p>Erdo\u011fan has also said he would seek to relocate more than 1 million Syrian refugees in this \u201csafe zone\u201d, both removing them from his country (where their presence has started to create a backlash) and complicating the demographic mix in what he fears could become an autonomous Kurdish state on his border.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How would a Turkish incursion impact on Isis?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Nearly 11,000 Isis fighters, including almost 2,000 foreigners, and tens of thousands of their wives and children, are being held in detention camps and hastily fortified prisons across north-eastern Syria.</p>\n    <p>SDF leaders have warned they cannot guarantee the security of these prisoners if they are forced to redeploy their forces to the frontlines of a war against Turkey. They also fear Isis could use the chaos of war to mount attacks to free their fighters or reclaim territory.<br></p>\n    <p>On 11 October, it was reported that at least five detained Isis fighters had escaped a prison in the region. Two days later, 750 foreign women affiliated to Isis and their children managed to break out of a secure annex in the Ain Issa camp for displaced people, according to SDF officials.</p>\n    <p>It is unclear which detention sites the SDF still controls and the status of the prisoners inside.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michael-safi\"><b>Michael Safi</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Some troops would remain in Syria\u2019s oilfields, Trump said. \u201cWe have secured the oil and, therefore, a small number of US troops will remain in the area where they have the oil.\u201d</p> \n<p>As Trump was speaking, his special envoy for Syria, James Jeffrey, told the US Congress that American forces had seen \u201cseveral incidents of what we consider war crimes\u201d by Turkish forces, during the recent attack on the Kurds.</p> \n<p>Jeffrey also said that \u201cover 100\u201d Islamic State prisoners had escaped during the Turkish offensive and \u201cwe do not know where they are.\u201d</p> \n<p>Earlier on Wednesday, Syrian and Russian media showed footage of Russian military police vehicles on the outskirts of the important towns of Manbij and Kobani, one day after Erdo\u011fan, met Vladimir Putin in Sochi.</p> \n<p>A statement carried on Russia\u2019s Interfax agency said Russian patrols had already begun inside Manbij, a town that until two weeks ago was a key US base in the region.</p> \n<p>The deal was hailed as a \u201cbig success\u201d by Trump, although his critics say it cements Russia\u2019s role as prime powerbroker in the Middle East.</p> \n<p>In an earlier tweet, the US president claimed the Kurds were safe and Isis prisoners secured.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1186985455058898945\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Big success on the Turkey/Syria Border.

The SDF and Kurdish politicians are yet to comment on the Sochi deal.</p> \n<p>It is believed they will retain control of the approximately 90,000 men, women and children with links to Islamic State being held in Kurdish-run prisons and detention camps.</p> \n<p>Turkish officials including Erdo\u011fan threatened on Wednesday that Ankara would resume the offensive if neither Russia nor the US guaranteed the total withdrawal of Kurdish fighters from the border region.</p> \n<p>Ankara says the YPG is indistinguishable from the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK), which has waged an insurgency against the Turkish state for decades. Erdo\u011fan said Putin responded by saying he would not let that happen.</p> \n<p>The border towns of Ras al-Ayn and Tel Abyad, which have experienced fierce fighting, remained quiet on Wednesday, one day after a separate, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/18/fighting-continues-on-syria-turkey-border-despite-ceasefire\">poorly</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/18/fighting-continues-on-syria-turkey-border-despite-ceasefire\"> observed</a> US-brokered ceasefire expired.</p> \n<p>Erdo\u011fan is scheduled to visit the White House next month.</p> \n<p>At least 120 Syrians have died and 176,000 people have fled their homes over the last two weeks of violence, with 20 Turkish civilian deaths on the other side of the border.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has announced that the US will lift sanctions on Turkey, taking credit for a ceasefire deal that should end Ankara\u2019s attack on Kurdish-led forces \u2013 at the price of ending the Kurds\u2019 dream of local autonomy. The US president, who has come under withering criticism for abruptly withdrawing US troops \u2013 and paving the way for a deadly Turkish offensive against the Kurds \u2013 said on Wednesday that a \u201csmall number\u201d of US troops would remain in Syria\u2019s oilfields. In a televised address on Wednesday, Trump emphasized that US troops were \u201csafe\u201d and said America would leave other powers to fight each other in the region. He added: \u201cLet someone else fight over this long-bloodstained sand. Wednesday\u2019s announcement came as Russian troops expanded their presence across north-eastern Syria, the result of an agreement between Ankara and Moscow. Just a week ago, Trump announced a series of financial punishments on Ankara \u2013 including the reimposition of 50% tariffs on Turkish steel \u2013 after Turkey launched its attack on Kurdish-led forces in north-eastern Syria. That offensive began hours after a phone call between Trump and Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan in which the Turkish president, informed Trump of his plans, and understood the US president to give a green light. \u201cThe government of Turkey informed my administration that they would be stopping combat and their offensive in Syria, and making the ceasefire permanent,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI have, therefore, instructed the secretary of the Treasury to lift all sanctions imposed October 14,\u201d he added. \u201cHow many Americans must die in the Middle East in the midst of these ancient sectarian and tribal conflicts?\u201d Trump said. \u201cI am committed to pursuing a different course, one that leads to victory for America.\u201d Some troops would remain in Syria\u2019s oilfields, Trump said. \u201cWe have secured the oil and, therefore, a small number of US troops will remain in the area where they have the oil.\u201d As Trump was speaking, his special envoy for Syria, James Jeffrey, told the US Congress that American forces had seen \u201cseveral incidents of what we consider war crimes\u201d by Turkish forces, during the recent attack on the Kurds. Jeffrey also said that \u201cover 100\u201d Islamic State prisoners had escaped during the Turkish offensive and \u201cwe do not know where they are.\u201d Earlier on Wednesday, Syrian and Russian media showed footage of Russian military police vehicles on the outskirts of the important towns of Manbij and Kobani, one day after Erdo\u011fan, met Vladimir Putin in Sochi. A statement carried on Russia\u2019s Interfax agency said Russian patrols had already begun inside Manbij, a town that until two weeks ago was a key US base in the region. The deal was hailed as a \u201cbig success\u201d by Trump, although his critics say it cements Russia\u2019s role as prime powerbroker in the Middle East. In an earlier tweet, the US president claimed the Kurds were safe and Isis prisoners secured. Turkish troops, allied Syrian rebel proxies, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and soldiers belonging to the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, are now all present in the border zone, with Russia the only negotiating force between them. The talks on Tuesday between Erdo\u011fan and the Russian president defined the contours of Turkey\u2019s long-proposed border \u201csafe zone\u201d: Turkish troops in the area seized since the offensive began on 9 October will remain in situ, and Russian soldiers and the Syrian army will control the rest of the frontier. Moscow and Damascus will supervise the removal of Kurdish fighters and weaponry to the depth of 18 miles (29km) from their current positions on the border before 26 October, after which joint Russian-Turkish patrols will begin across the entire border area to a depth of six miles, with the exception of the de facto Kurdish capital, Qamishli. On Wednesday, the Russian ministry of defence published a map showing 15 planned border observation posts that will be manned by the Syrian regime. The deal in effect redraws the map of northern Syria and ends five years of semi-autonomy carved out by the local Kurdish administration and its military forces, after Kurdish officials reached an agreement with Assad, their former enemy, for military reinforcements to fend off the Turkish attack. However, the fate of local military councils set up by the SDF in border towns previously under their control and what happens to the SDF\u2019s non-Kurdish units remains unclear. The SDF and Kurdish politicians are yet to comment on the Sochi deal. It is believed they will retain control of the approximately 90,000 men, women and children with links to Islamic State being held in Kurdish-run prisons and detention camps. Turkish officials including Erdo\u011fan threatened on Wednesday that Ankara would resume the offensive if neither Russia nor the US guaranteed the total withdrawal of Kurdish fighters from the border region. Ankara says the YPG is indistinguishable from the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK), which has waged an insurgency against the Turkish state for decades. Erdo\u011fan said Putin responded by saying he would not let that happen. The border towns of Ras al-Ayn and Tel Abyad, which have experienced fierce fighting, remained quiet on Wednesday, one day after a separate, poorly observed US-brokered ceasefire expired. Erdo\u011fan is scheduled to visit the White House next month. At least 120 Syrians have died and 176,000 people have fled their homes over the last two weeks of violence, with 20 Turkish civilian deaths on the other side of the border.",

On 13 October, Kurdish leaders agreed to allow Syrian regime forces to enter some cities to protect them from being captured by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey\">Turkey</a>&nbsp;and its allies. The deal effectively hands over control of huge swathes of the region to Damascus.</p>\n    <p>That leaves north-eastern&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria\">Syria</a>&nbsp;divided between Syrian regime forces, Syrian opposition militia and their Turkish allies, and areas still held by the SDF \u2013 for now.</p>\n    <p>On 17 October Turkish president,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan\">Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan</a>, agreed with US vice-president Mike Pence, to suspend Ankara\u2019s operation for&nbsp; five days in order to allow Kurdish troops to withdraw. The following week, on 22 October, Erdo\u011fan and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/22/turkey-and-russia-agree-deal-over-buffer-zone-in-northern-syria\">agreed on the parameters of the proposed Turkish \u201csafe zone\u201d</a> in Syria.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How did the SDF come to control the region?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Before the SDF was formed in 2015, the Kurds had created their own militias who mobilised during the Syrian civil war to defend Kurdish cities and villages and carve out what they hoped would eventually at least become a semi-autonomous province.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>In late 2014, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/20/turkey-iraqi-kurds-kobani-isis-fighters-us-air-drops-arms\">Kurds were struggling</a>&nbsp;to fend off an Islamic State siege of Kobane, a major city under their control. With US support, including arms and airstrikes, the Kurds managed to beat back Isis and went on to win a string of victories against the radical militant group. Along the way the fighters absorbed non-Kurdish groups, changed their name to the SDF and grew to include 60,000 soldiers.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why does Turkey oppose the Kurds?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>For years, Turkey has watched the growing ties between the US and SDF with alarm. Significant numbers of the Kurds in the SDF were also members of the People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG), an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK) that has fought an insurgency against the Turkish state for more than 35 years in which as many as 40,000 people have died. The PKK initially called for independence and now demands greater autonomy for Kurds inside&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey\">Turkey</a>.</p>\n    <p>Turkey claims the PKK has continued to wage war on the Turkish state, even as it has assisted in the fight against Isis. The PKK is listed as a terrorist group by Turkey, the US, the UK, Nato and others and this has proved awkward for the US and its allies, who have chosen to downplay the SDF\u2019s links to the PKK, preferring to focus on their shared objective of defeating Isis.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are Turkey\u2019s objectives on its southern border?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Turkey aims firstly to push the SDF away from its border, creating a 20-mile (32km) buffer zone that would have been jointly patrolled by Turkish and US troops until Trump\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/07/us-withdrawal-from-syria-leaves-fate-of-isis-fighters-and-families-in-detention-uncertain\">recent announcement</a>&nbsp;that American soldiers would withdraw from the region.</p>\n    <p>Erdo\u011fan has also said he would seek to relocate more than 1 million Syrian refugees in this \u201csafe zone\u201d, both removing them from his country (where their presence has started to create a backlash) and complicating the demographic mix in what he fears could become an autonomous Kurdish state on his border.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How would a Turkish incursion impact on Isis?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Nearly 11,000 Isis fighters, including almost 2,000 foreigners, and tens of thousands of their wives and children, are being held in detention camps and hastily fortified prisons across north-eastern Syria.</p>\n    <p>SDF leaders have warned they cannot guarantee the security of these prisoners if they are forced to redeploy their forces to the frontlines of a war against Turkey. They also fear Isis could use the chaos of war to mount attacks to free their fighters or reclaim territory.<br></p>\n    <p>On 11 October, it was reported that at least five detained Isis fighters had escaped a prison in the region. Two days later, 750 foreign women affiliated to Isis and their children managed to break out of a secure annex in the Ain Issa camp for displaced people, according to SDF officials.</p>\n    <p>It is unclear which detention sites the SDF still controls and the status of the prisoners inside.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michael-safi\"><b>Michael Safi</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The US president was planning to make a fresh statement on the issue on Wednesday morning.

Business representatives believe the big companies such as supermarket chains will be able to put systems in place to deal with any checks but will be looking for government assistance to help smaller businesses.</p>\n    <p>The extent and type of checks will not be clear until the detail of the deal emerges, but essentially they fall into two categories: tariffs and VAT. Excise duties also apply but will not trouble most importers as they generally apply to a limited amount of controlled goods including alcohol, cigarettes and fuel.</p>\n    <p>Customs declarations apply for both exports and imports and, although the trade is domestic, for the purposes of this version of a Brexit backstop, the checks will be made on behalf of the EU. It is concerned about goods from a third country leaking into Ireland and therefore the single market.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Will there be a border through the Irish Sea immediately if parliament votes for a deal?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>No. The discussion over the Irish border is part of Boris Johnson\u2019s alternative arrangements to the controversial backstop.

A change can only happen if it is voted on by the Stormont assembly.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Consent</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Stormont will have a key role in future Brexit arrangements. And if there is cross-community support to remain aligned to the EU rather than the UK the consent will hold for eight years.</p>\n    <p>The arrangements in this deal will automatically kick in for a mandated four years if there is a breakdown in trade talks, so it remains a \u201cbackstop\u201d but with a permanent tinge.</p>\n    <p>That four-year period will start at the end of December 2020.</p>\n    <p>Two months before the end of the four-year period, that is October 2024, Stormont will be asked to vote on whether to remain aligned to the EU in ways outlined by this deal or not.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Checks on border, ports and airports</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Under the deal, the UK and the EU are \u201cunderlining their firm commitment to no customs and regulatory checks or controls and related physical infrastructure at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland\u201d.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Future trade deals</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The EU and the UK will aim for a zero-tariff deal with unlimited quotas. The entire UK, including Northern Ireland, will be free to sign trade deals. The line in the political declaration that \u201cthe United Kingdom will consider aligning with union rules in relevant areas\u201d in any future trade talks has been ditched.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Customs</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Northern Ireland will remain legally in the UK customs territory but practically in the EU customs unions. There will therefore be no customs checks on the border but tariffs will be payable on certain commercial goods.</p>\n    <p>No customs duties will be payable on \u201cpersonal property\u201d being transited from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. That protects online shopping and all items bought for personal rather than commercial use.</p>\n    <p>Customs duties will be payable on goods imported from the UK for commercial use unless it can be demonstrated that the goods remain in Northern Ireland or are for personal use, as above.</p>\n    <p>A system of rebates will allow importers to be reimbursed.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>West/east trade</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The commitment to frictionless trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain is restated.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>VAT</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>EU law on VAT will apply in Northern Ireland.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Single electricity market</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The island of Ireland is considering a single market for electricity so homes in Northern Ireland can get their energy from a supplier in Northern Ireland or the republic. There were fears this could be disrupted by Brexit. Under the Johnson deal, the provisions of union law remain so nothing will change.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Level playing field</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This guarantees that the UK will remain in line with EU conventions on climate, environment and workers rights in a future trade agreement.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lisaocarroll\"><b>Lisa O'Carroll</b></a>&nbsp;<i>Brexit correspondent</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The DUP\u2019s Jim Shannon said it was an \u201cabsolutely despicable deal\u201d and the union flag in Northern Ireland was hanging \u201ca wee bit tattered at the moment\u201d.</p> \n<p>The government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/eu-withdrawal-agreement-bill\">Brexit impact assessment paper</a> that accompanied the publication of the withdrawal agreement bill on Monday night shows that east-west checks would affect 3,517 businesses.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson\u2019s hopes of achieving Brexit by his \u201cdo or die\u201d deadline of 31 October may look increasingly remote, but there is little immediate sign that Labour is going to be able to capitalise. The Conservatives already enjoy a healthy poll lead of 10 points, on average, according to Britain Elects, with the government on 35%. That leaves Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s opposition on 25%, while the Liberal Democrats sit at 18%. It is a figure so dismal that the party is behind where Michael Foot was in the run-up to the 1983 election, according to the elections expert John Curtice of Strathclyde University \u2013 and would result in a Conservative majority of about 60 on forecasts prepared by Electoral Calculus based on October\u2019s polling. And this is with Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party at 12%. The same firm\u2019s regional analysis has the Conservatives losing seats in Scotland to the dominant Scottish National party and the south-west to the Liberal Democrats. But it is forecast to win far more straight from Labour in Wales (where the Tories are ahead), Yorkshire, the north-westof England and in the West and east Midlands \u2013 where elections are lost and won. Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal has already landed better than Theresa May\u2019s did last November \u2013 which included a number of resignations from cabinet. The circumstances are different: when the 29 March deadline was missed that was the final straw for May after an extended period of Tory feuding. The polling firm Deltapoll believes that Johnson is better able to rally the Conservative base. Joe Twyman, a founder of the firm, said: \u201cJohnson is trusted by leave voters in a way that May was not; our sense is that few leave voters will blame the prime minister for the latest Brexit extension in the short term.\u201d Deltapoll\u2019s research showed that 32% of the British public supported the deal, marginally more than the 29% that were set against it. Equally as significant, 39% were undecided \u2013 giving Labour something to play for if it could reset opinion with its warnings about the economic impact or lack of protection for workers\u2019 rights. The high proportion of deal undecideds underscores the volatility that remains a well-remarked feature of the political scene. During October, Conservative poll leads have varied between three and 15 points, making a hung parliament with the Tories as the largest party a very real possibility. A fortnight ago, the British Election Study \u2013 providing long-running research on voting behaviour \u2013 reported the two most volatile elections in postwar history were 2015 followed by 2017, where 43% and 33% of voters respectively opted for a different party than the one they had voted for in previous elections. The argument is that traditional loyalties have been eroded by a series of shocks: the financial crash, the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition, the Scottish referendum and Brexit. But, despite what some Labour MPs were hoping for, it is hard to believe the latest Brexit delay represents a shock in itself. An election, Twyman observed, would be \u201ca major gamble\u201d for both parties, but in Westminster Conservative MPs are keener. It is easy to find anxious Labour MPs sitting on small majorities \u2013 and even ones with larger majorities in inner-city seats who are fretting about the unambiguously pro-remain Liberal Democrats and the response to Corbyn on the doorstep. Labour insiders countered by saying the 2017 result showed that, in an election campaign, the focus should broaden from Brexit, and the party\u2019s anti-austerity agenda would again prove popular. The party\u2019s problem is that Conservatives are prepared for this too, having increased school funding and police numbers. Corbyn and other Labour figures have said they want an election once no deal has been \u201ctaken off the table\u201d. Against this polling background it would not be surprising, however, if the opposition party found more reasons for delay.",

      "bodyText": "Soaring deforestation coupled with the destructive policies of Brazil\u2019s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, could push the Amazon rainforest dangerously to an irreversible \u201ctipping point\u201d within two years, a prominent economist has said. After this point the rainforest would stop producing enough rain to sustain itself and start slowly degrading into a drier savannah, releasing billions of tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere, which would exacerbate global heating and disrupt weather across South America. The warning came in a policy brief published this week by Monica de Bolle, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington DC. The report sparked controversy among climate scientists. Some believe the tipping point is still 15 to 20 years away, while others say the warning accurately reflects the danger that Bolsonaro and global heating pose to the Amazon\u2019s survival. \u201cIt\u2019s a stock, so like any stock you run it down, run it down \u2013 then suddenly you don\u2019t have any more of it,\u201d said de Bolle, whose brief also recommended solutions to the current crisis. Bolsonaro has vowed to develop the Amazon, and his government plans to allow mining on protected indigenous reserves. Amazon farmers support his attacks on environmental protection agencies. His business-friendly environment minister, Ricardo Salles, has met loggers and wildcat miners, while deforestation and Amazon fires have soared since he assumed office in January. The policy brief noted that Brazil\u2019s space research institute, INPE, reported that deforestation in August was 222% higher than in August 2018. Maintaining the current rate of increase INPE reported between January and August this year would bring the Amazon \u201cdangerously close to the estimated tipping point as soon as 2021 \u2026 beyond which the rainforest can no longer generate enough rain to sustain itself\u201d, de Bolle wrote. De Bolle is also head of the Latin American studies programme at Johns Hopkins University and last month addressed a US Congress committee on preserving the Amazon. She called her prediction a \u201cprovocation\u201d. \u201cIf Bolsonaro is serious about developing the Amazon without paying any attention to sustainability or maintaining the forest\u2019s standing, these rates would happen within his mandate,\u201d she said. Carlos Nobre, one of Brazil\u2019s leading climate scientists and a senior researcher at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s Institute for Advanced Studies, questioned her calculation that estimated deforestation would quadruple from an estimate of nearly 18,000 km2 this year to nearly 70,000 km2 by 2021. \u201cIt seems very improbable to me \u2013 the projected deforestation increase is more an economic calculation than ecological,\u201d he said. However, he added: \u201cWe are seeing an increase in deforestation, I am not questioning this.\u201d Last year, Nobre argued in an article written with celebrated American conservation biologist Thomas Lovejoy that the Amazon tipping point could happen in eastern, southern and central Amazonia when 20% to 25% of the rainforest has been felled \u2013 not expected for 20 to 25 years. He has since brought forward his prediction by about five years. \u201cThe Amazon is already 17% deforested, so when you calculate at the current rate of deforestation, this 20% to 25% is reached in 15 to 20 years,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope she is wrong.

Mongabay reported last month that Brazil looks increasingly unlikely to meet its Paris targets. Deforestation began rising under Rousseff in 2013 after nine years of decline and has accelerated under Bolsonaro. Claudio Angelo of the Climate Observatory \u2013 an umbrella of non-profit environmental groups \u2013 said he thought de Bolle\u2019s calculations were too pessimistic, but praised her brief\u2019s other recommendations. These included expanding the Amazon fund, which finances sustainable rainforest projects to include the United States and other countries so that Brazil is not expected to fund rainforest protection virtually on its own. The Amazon Fund is currently financed by Norway and Germany, but both countries suspended payments in August. De Bolle said Brazil should revive a resolution that made rural credit financed by public banks dependent on lenders proving that they complied with environmental and other laws. \u201cThat\u2019s a big stick,\u201d she said. Angelo said \u201cthe points [de Bolle] made are quite real\u201d. \u201cFor all the madness, Bolsonaro did manage to make people talk about the Amazon,\u201d he said.",

His old buddy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/21/francis-ford-coppola-scorsese-was-being-kind-marvel-movies-are-despicable\">Francis Ford Coppola</a> backed Scorsese up: \u201cHe\u2019s right because we expect to learn something from cinema, we expect to gain something, some enlightenment, some knowledge, some inspiration \u2026 I don\u2019t know that anyone gets anything out of seeing the same movie over and over again.\u201d Bam! When asked, a fair number of film-makers think the same, it turns out. Earlier this week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/22/superhero-films-are-cynical-exercise-to-make-profits-for-corporations-ken-loach\">Ken Loach dismissed Marvel movies</a> as \u201ccommodities, like hamburgers\u201d designed to \u201cmake a profit for a big corporation\u201d. Thwack!</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/alan-moore\">Alan Moore</a>, who has distanced himself from all film and TV adaptations of his work, <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2016/09/alan-moore-jerusalem-comics-writer.html\">said pretty much the same thing in an interview</a> a few years ago: \u201cWhat are these movies doing other than entertaining us with stories and characters that were meant to entertain the 12-year-old boys of 50 years ago?\u201d he asked, adding, \u201cI tend to see a lot of these current figures as the focus of a kind of unhealthy escapism.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cd598ecc8cfa2c6e302f667e27cdd77fc7b494ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd598ecc8cfa2c6e302f667e27cdd77fc7b494ae/0_0_3085_2365/1000.jpg\" alt=\"City-trashing epic \u2026 Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"767\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">City-trashing epic \u2026 Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied by LMK</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many have rushed to the defence of comic-book content, and argued that it doesn\u2019t have to be an either/or debate, but there\u2019s a sense that these fantasies can only reach so far into the real world before they\u2019re confronted with their own absurdity. Post-Watchmen, the genre has been on a steady journey towards greater realism, at least on screen. You can mark it in the difference between Tim Burton\u2019s 1989 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,,558607,00.html\">Batman</a>, set in a cartoonish Gotham City, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/jul/25/actionandadventure1\">Christopher Nolan\u2019s grittier Batman trilogy</a>, set in what could be 21st-century reality. The contradictions opened up as the genre arrived at city-trashing epics like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/27/batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice-observer-review\">Batman v Superman</a> (Who\u2019s going to clean up all that destruction? How many civilian casualties were there?). Or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/20/captain-america-civil-war-review-an-aspartame-rush\">Captain America: Civil War</a>, where one politician describes Marvel\u2019s superhero team as \u201cUS-based, enhanced individuals who routinely ignore sovereign borders, who inflict their will wherever they choose, and who frankly seem unconcerned about what they leave behind.\u201d The record-breaking <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/24/avengers-infinity-war-review-supremely-entertaining-showdown-in-the-grand-marvel-tradition\">Avengers: Infinity War</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/23/avengers-endgame-review-unconquerable-brilliance-takes-marvel-to-new-heights\">Endgame</a> subsequently steered away from such complexities, and set up a fantasy good-v-evil showdown taking place far from populated areas. That could be read as a retreat back into \u201ccomic book\u201d realms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5e803f41c68c6c8aaeb6f5b4f2fcacb3352a0316\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e803f41c68c6c8aaeb6f5b4f2fcacb3352a0316/0_0_3328_1484/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Malin Akerman and Billy Crudup as Dr Manhattan in the 2009 film version of Watchmen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"446\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Not the most stable \u2026 Malin Akerman and Billy Crudup as Dr Manhattan in the 2009 film version of Watchmen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Warner Bros/Everett/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Moore despaired of Watchmen\u2019s effect on the comics industry, which he described as \u201clike being in a hall of mirrors in a funfair, where you can only see ugly, distorted reflections of yourself\u201d.

At the heart of the 12-part story was the suggestion that in reality (or a parallel version of it), those who felt compelled to dress up in costumes and inflict extrajudicial violence upon strangers might not be the most stable members of society. In Watchmen\u2019s alternate reality, costumed vigilantes first appear in the 1940s (mirroring the rise of comic books themselves), and largely turn out to be psychopaths, rapists, sexual \u201cdeviants\u201d, violent fascists and self-interested schemers. They become such a problem, they are outlawed in the 1970s. By the mid-1980s when the main story is set, these caped crusaders have either quietly retired, defied the ban and kept going, become shady government operatives, or leveraged their celebrity into business. There is only one genuinely superpowered being in the story: Doctor Manhattan, a physicist who gains godlike powers as the result of a nuclear accident. He helps the US win the Vietnam war, but ultimately tires of human affairs and emigrates to Mars. There are no good or evil characters and no evident \u201cheroes\u201d to the tale.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>In Moore's Watchmen, costumed vigilantes largely turn out to be psychopaths, rapists, 'deviants', fascists and schemers</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The new Watchmen series, written by Damon Lindelof (creator of Lost and The Leftovers), takes the story in a different direction but retains the spirit of the original, not least in its jaded view of vigilantism.

      "bodyText": "Alan Moore\u2019s celebrated 1986 series Watchmen revolved around a conspiracy to kill off masked vigilantes, and in effect that\u2019s what it did in real life. Compared with the complex, mature, literary nature of Watchmen, most other comic-book titles looked juvenile and two-dimensional. This was at a time when \u201ccomic-book movies\u201d meant Christopher Reeve\u2019s wholesome Superman series, and when the only inhabitant of the Marvel movie universe was Howard the Duck. The entire industry had to up its game, and a new era of mature \u201cgraphic novels\u201d was born. Now we appear to have come full circle \u2013 which is fitting for a story so heavy with clock symbolism. With uncanny timing, HBO\u2019s lavish new Watchmen series arrives at a moment when comic-book movies are again in what you might call a decadent phase of the cycle. They have decisively conquered our screens and our box offices, with ever grander and more improbable forms of spectacle, to the extent that we\u2019re now beginning to question how much more of them we need. Could Watchmen kill off the superheroes once again? The backlash has been building with surprising speed. Earlier this month, Martin Scorsese struck a nerve by confessing he\u2019d tried to watch Marvel\u2019s movies but did not consider them to be \u201ccinema\u201d. At least, not in the sense of \u201chuman beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being\u201d. Pow! His old buddy Francis Ford Coppola backed Scorsese up: \u201cHe\u2019s right because we expect to learn something from cinema, we expect to gain something, some enlightenment, some knowledge, some inspiration \u2026 I don\u2019t know that anyone gets anything out of seeing the same movie over and over again.\u201d Bam! When asked, a fair number of film-makers think the same, it turns out. Earlier this week Ken Loach dismissed Marvel movies as \u201ccommodities, like hamburgers\u201d designed to \u201cmake a profit for a big corporation\u201d. Thwack! Alan Moore, who has distanced himself from all film and TV adaptations of his work, said pretty much the same thing in an interview a few years ago: \u201cWhat are these movies doing other than entertaining us with stories and characters that were meant to entertain the 12-year-old boys of 50 years ago?\u201d he asked, adding, \u201cI tend to see a lot of these current figures as the focus of a kind of unhealthy escapism.\u201d Many have rushed to the defence of comic-book content, and argued that it doesn\u2019t have to be an either/or debate, but there\u2019s a sense that these fantasies can only reach so far into the real world before they\u2019re confronted with their own absurdity. Post-Watchmen, the genre has been on a steady journey towards greater realism, at least on screen. You can mark it in the difference between Tim Burton\u2019s 1989 Batman, set in a cartoonish Gotham City, and Christopher Nolan\u2019s grittier Batman trilogy, set in what could be 21st-century reality. The contradictions opened up as the genre arrived at city-trashing epics like Batman v Superman (Who\u2019s going to clean up all that destruction? How many civilian casualties were there?). Or Captain America: Civil War, where one politician describes Marvel\u2019s superhero team as \u201cUS-based, enhanced individuals who routinely ignore sovereign borders, who inflict their will wherever they choose, and who frankly seem unconcerned about what they leave behind.\u201d The record-breaking Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame subsequently steered away from such complexities, and set up a fantasy good-v-evil showdown taking place far from populated areas. That could be read as a retreat back into \u201ccomic book\u201d realms. Moore despaired of Watchmen\u2019s effect on the comics industry, which he described as \u201clike being in a hall of mirrors in a funfair, where you can only see ugly, distorted reflections of yourself\u201d. He wrote Watchmen to bury the superhero genre, not to reinvigorate it. At the heart of the 12-part story was the suggestion that in reality (or a parallel version of it), those who felt compelled to dress up in costumes and inflict extrajudicial violence upon strangers might not be the most stable members of society. In Watchmen\u2019s alternate reality, costumed vigilantes first appear in the 1940s (mirroring the rise of comic books themselves), and largely turn out to be psychopaths, rapists, sexual \u201cdeviants\u201d, violent fascists and self-interested schemers. They become such a problem, they are outlawed in the 1970s. By the mid-1980s when the main story is set, these caped crusaders have either quietly retired, defied the ban and kept going, become shady government operatives, or leveraged their celebrity into business. There is only one genuinely superpowered being in the story: Doctor Manhattan, a physicist who gains godlike powers as the result of a nuclear accident. He helps the US win the Vietnam war, but ultimately tires of human affairs and emigrates to Mars. There are no good or evil characters and no evident \u201cheroes\u201d to the tale. The new Watchmen series, written by Damon Lindelof (creator of Lost and The Leftovers), takes the story in a different direction but retains the spirit of the original, not least in its jaded view of vigilantism. Just as the first Watchmen reflected the Doomsday-clock nuclear paranoia of the cold war, so this story, set 35 years later, chimes with America\u2019s current racial tensions.

Unlike some of his aggressive and fiercely personal attacks on opponents, the US president appeared to be struggling early on Wednesday in any attempt to discredit the explosive account given by Taylor \u2013 a career diplomat who discussed his role in detail with the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, earlier this year before accepting the post of acting ambassador to Ukraine. Trump resorted to quoting, on Twitter, the Texas Republican congressman John Ratcliffe, who claimed on Fox News that Ukraine had not been aware that Trump was holding back congressionally approved military aid for the country when he requested an investigation into Joe Biden. However, news reports on Monday cast doubts on Trump\u2019s denials of a quid pro quo. The New York Times reported that Ukrainian officials were aware of the aid freeze beginning in early August, contradicting Trump\u2019s assertion that there could not have been a quid pro quo because Kyiv did not previously know the funding had been held up. Meanwhile, the Associated Press reported that the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, voiced concern to advisers as early as May about Trump pressuring him to investigate Biden. Trump had earlier repeated one of his most common protests, that investigations against him, whether the Trump-Ukraine impeachment inquiry or the previous Trump-Russia investigation conducted by the special counsel Robert Mueller, add up to nothing more than a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d. He then added on Twitter on Wednesday morning that the fight to regain the majority in the House of Representatives for the Republicans in the 2020 election \u2013 after losing control in the 2018 midterm elections \u2013 is on. On Tuesday, in 10 hours of testimony behind closed doors, Taylor provided congressional committees conducting impeachment hearings a detailed account of how Trump repeatedly sought to make a summit meeting for Zelenskiy, at the White House and a military aid package to Ukraine conditional on Zelenskiy launching investigations into Trump\u2019s political opponents. Taylor\u2019s testimony was the latest in a series of depositions by serving and former administration officials, as part of the impeachment inquiry, about Trump\u2019s use of the presidency to put pressure on the Ukrainian government to procure compromising information on his political rivals. And it was the most detailed and damning to date. The veteran diplomat said that soon after arriving in Kyiv, he became concerned \u201cour relationship with Ukraine was being fundamentally undermined by an irregular informal channel of US policymaking, and by the withholding of vital security assistance for domestic political reasons\u201d. Taylor said this irregular channel was run by Trump through several emissaries: his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani; the departing energy secretary, Rick Perry; the ambassador to the EU, Gordon Sondland; and the special Ukraine envoy, Kurt Volker. They became focused solely on persuading Zelenskiy to announce investigations that would damage Democrats and especially Biden, the former vice-president and a leading contender to the be the 2020 Democratic nominee. Democrats declared it to be the clearest account to date of Trump\u2019s abuse of office in the Ukraine scandal. The White House spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham, issued a statement late on Tuesday denouncing the congressional hearings as \u201ca coordinated smear campaign from far-left lawmakers and radical unelected bureaucrats waging war on the constitution\u201d. According to Taylor\u2019s statement, published by the Lawfare website, Sondland made clear that both aid and a White House summit were conditional on the launch of two investigations. One into a Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, which had employed Biden\u2019s son Hunter.

Stretching along the Atlantic coast, some 300 miles north of Madrid, the region could be mistaken for Switzerland with its snow-capped Picos de Europa range and bovine traffic jams, or for Ireland with its quiet fishing ports and shamrock-blanketed hills, were it not for its distinctive singsongy language and palpable Spanish alegr\u00eda. Spaniards have long been enamoured with Asturias \u2013 the Spanish press has never stopped cooing about its nature or beaches or cuisine \u2013 but only recently has the rest of the world started to catch on to this secret Eden, hiding in plain sight. For starters, if Asturias didn\u2019t have such a culinary show-off (San Sebasti\u00e1n) for a neighbour, it would probably be the country\u2019s top food destination. Ultra-fresh ingredients from land and sea make for a cuisine defined by its simplicity and variety: fabes con almejas (beans with clams) might be followed by pix\u00edn a la sidra (cider-braised monkfish) and frixuelos (hot, sugared cr\u00eapes). Inland, Asturian Valley beef reigns supreme, while along the coast, lunch is often whatever scaly critter flopped on to the wharf that morning, simply grilled, fried or stewed. Cheese is a mainstay everywhere; try cabrales, Spain\u2019s eye-wateringly pungent answer to roquefort, if you dare. Soak up the views with a glass of sidra, properly poured from head height, and some cabrales And then there\u2019s the sidra (cider). In Asturias it stands in for wine, and locals guzzle it by the gallon in raucous sidrer\u00edas. There\u2019s a reason Anthony Bourdain called Asturias the most extraordinary place he had ever been to. Architecture buffs might agree with Bourdain, since Asturias boasts a jaw-dropping ensemble of Unesco-protected, pre-Romanesque (8th-12th century) buildings, most of which are open to the public. The magnificently preserved churches and monasteries are a testament to the Asturians\u2019 fierce resistance to the Moors, who could never quite gain a foothold in the region, despite conquering much of the rest of the peninsula. Think of a trip to Asturias as a rejuvenating, under-the-radar alternative (or counterpoint) to Madrid\u2019s frenetic bustle, the Basque country\u2019s overcrowded pintxo bars, or Barcelona\u2019s swarmed tourist sites. Here are some of the region\u2019s highlights. Beaches The Asturian coast mixes up sandy beaches, rocky outcrops and outstanding surfing spots The Atlantic might be bracing out of the summer, but with a bit of pluck (and perhaps some neoprene), you can blissfully swim or surf the day away. For serenity and sheer Insta-prettiness, Playa del Silencio (Casta\u00f1eras) is an obligatory stop: it occupies a pebbly cove, sheltered by craggy grey cliffs that jut out into the sea. Surfers shouldn\u2019t miss Playa de Rodiles (Villaviciosa) and Playa de los Quebrantos (Soto del Barco).

It is far from the madding crowds that occasionally mar the Camino Frances \u2013 the most popular pilgrim route to Santiago de Compostela, and therefore occasionally chock-a-block with walkers. I like the almost 200-mile-long Camino Primitivo precisely because of its less-trod character. You\u2019d be forgiven for assuming that the Primitivo was, well, primitive. It\u2019s not, of course. The Spanish word translates best into English as \u201coriginal\u201d because it is the original camino \u2013 or so the people of Asturias will tell you. A long and winding history The Camino Primitivo takes in some of Spain\u2019s most stunning holy sites, such as the monastery of Santa Mar\u00eda La Real de Obona (above) and the Cathedral of San Salvador It all goes back to Alfonso the Chaste who, in AD791, ascended the throne of the Kingdom of Asturias, aged 31. An austere fellow say the histories, he married, but apparently never consummated the union (and how do they know, one might ask), devoting himself instead to living as a Christian aesthete and ruling for a thumping 51 years. Alfonso settled in Oviedo (or Uvi\u00e9u in Asturian) and declared the city the capital of Asturias, which it remains to this day. From here, in 813, he set out on his horse for Galicia, on the other side of the mountains, having been told by the Bishop of Flavia that the remains of the apostle St James the Great, had been discovered there, in a place known as the field of stars. James is to Spain what Patrick is to Ireland \u2013 both brought Christianity to the respective countries, ridding them of the heathen influence of pagans. And so the spot in Galicia where the bones were allegedly found quickly became Santiago de Compostela, where Alfonso mandated the construction of a chapel to hold the remains. It is said that Alfonso became the first pilgrim to the site, which quickly became a pilgrimage destination for devotees of the saint. The fact that this fortuitous discovery coincided with La Reconquista, Catholic Spain\u2019s ultimately successful war to drive the Moors from Iberia, is perhaps more than a little coincidental. Setting out While there are fewer churches along the Primitivo than the more developed, nearly 500-mile-long Camino Frances, what they lack in number they make up in ecclesiastical significance. In the Cathedral of San Salvador, for instance, the nave houses a giant stone urn reputed to be one of those that held the water Christ turned into wine at the wedding in Cana. Also in the cathedral is a shroud in which Christ\u2019s head was allegedly wrapped after his death. The cathedral will issue you with your must-have credencial, or camino passport \u2013 to be stamped by each albergue stayed in and essential for getting your compostela certificate in Santiago. Strike out from Oviedo in the early morning, guided by yellow arrows and the bronze scallop shells set into granite pavement flags. The way soon leads into the mountains, the valleys below blanketed in early morning mist; the hedgerows drenched in dew. Asturias is associated with a lot of old industries. The Romans mined there for gold; while its mountains were exploited for coal and iron ore throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. But those days are gone and, now, the region is reinventing itself successfully as a natural paradise. On the road In the calm, early summer morning on the Primitivo, nature feels intensely close. Walking along dirt tracks or narrow country lanes, drink in the sounds and smells of the countryside. Aspects of country life that used to be commonplace in the UK and Ireland \u2013 dung-spattered tracks, the sound of mooing in the distance and the clockwork humming of milking machinery in barns, many of them pleasingly old wooden structures \u2013 are still part and parcel of the everyday here. The hedgerows and trees are alive. Birds sing; bells tinkle in fields; water trickles along ditch streams and cocks crow in farmyards. The upland meadows are filled with colour. In the late spring and early summer, the fields are not yet cut for hay and so wild flowers thrive and sway gently in the breeze. As the sun gets higher and the temperature rises, the insects stir and chatter.

And with it, the joy of arrival, of walking, maybe hand-in-hand with someone special, under a stone archway with the sound of Galician pipes ricocheting through the air, and into that magnificent cathedral square \u2026 There really is nothing else quite like it.

She co-authored a number of advisory commentaries on influenza virus risks and was a key person in signing off the annually revised composition of the influenza virus vaccine for the northern hemisphere.

      "body": "<p>There are several ways a person who doesn\u2019t want to be found can conceal themselves in a lorry. If you are able-bodied and strong enough, you can crawl between the wheel-axles and the base, and hang on for as long as your arms hold out. If not, you can try to cram yourself into the tiny storage box that sits between the wheels, a feat of contortion as well as endurance. Or, if you have the means, you can unlock and climb inside the main container, which may or may not be airtight. You do these things because you want to cross an international border you do not have permission to cross.</p> <p>Every so often, as with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/23/driver-arrested-after-39-bodies-found-in-lorry-container-in-essex\" title=\"\">today\u2019s news that 39 people have been found dead in a lorry in Essex</a>, the risks of this mode of transport become impossible to ignore. I have met people who have travelled by all these means, and all of them were taking a leap into the unknown. Jamal, a young man from Sudan who spent time in Calais, kept hiding underneath lorries he thought were bound for Britain then having to jump off on the motorways of France and Belgium when they turned out to be heading elsewhere. A Kurdish man I know who made his way from Iran to Europe a decade ago had to watch the smugglers who offered him safe passage beat up other travellers, and wonder if they would do the same to him. Zainab, an Iraqi mother of three, climbed into a refrigerated lorry with her children one night in France in the autumn of 2014, expecting the driver to set off for the Channel. Instead, he remained parked and switched off the ventilation.

      "bodyText": "There are several ways a person who doesn\u2019t want to be found can conceal themselves in a lorry. If you are able-bodied and strong enough, you can crawl between the wheel-axles and the base, and hang on for as long as your arms hold out. If not, you can try to cram yourself into the tiny storage box that sits between the wheels, a feat of contortion as well as endurance. Or, if you have the means, you can unlock and climb inside the main container, which may or may not be airtight. You do these things because you want to cross an international border you do not have permission to cross. Every so often, as with today\u2019s news that 39 people have been found dead in a lorry in Essex, the risks of this mode of transport become impossible to ignore. I have met people who have travelled by all these means, and all of them were taking a leap into the unknown. Jamal, a young man from Sudan who spent time in Calais, kept hiding underneath lorries he thought were bound for Britain then having to jump off on the motorways of France and Belgium when they turned out to be heading elsewhere. A Kurdish man I know who made his way from Iran to Europe a decade ago had to watch the smugglers who offered him safe passage beat up other travellers, and wonder if they would do the same to him. Zainab, an Iraqi mother of three, climbed into a refrigerated lorry with her children one night in France in the autumn of 2014, expecting the driver to set off for the Channel. Instead, he remained parked and switched off the ventilation. The police arrived just as other passengers began to suffocate. The 38 adults and one teenager whose bodies were discovered today have yet to be identified and concrete details of their journey are still emerging, though it appears that the lorry came from Bulgaria. It echoes other similar incidents: the 58 men and women found dead in a lorry at Dover in 2000; the 71 decomposing bodies abandoned in a lorry at the side of a motorway in Austria in 2015; or the 35 men, women and children discovered in a shipping container at Tilbury Docks in 2014, suffering from hypothermia and severe dehydration. Our immediate reaction is usually shock, and a desire to prevent things like this from happening again.

      "body": "<p>The music industry has a woman problem. It\u2019s a long-standing fact. Looking at last year\u2019s biggest hit singles in the UK, there were three times as many male as female pop stars. It lingers behind the scenes, too; women made up just <a href=\"http://assets.uscannenberg.org/docs/aii-inclusion-recording-studio-2019.pdf\">12% of songwriters and 2% of producers</a> on the Billboard Hot 100 between 2012 and 2018.</p> <p>Despite years of head-scratching over the cause, one reason is hiding in plain sight. Or, perhaps it is intentionally overlooked. New figures from the Musicians\u2019 Union \u2013 which represents more than 31,000 artists, from rock musicians to orchestral players \u2013 suggests almost half of its members have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/23/artists-quitting-music-business-abuse-and-sexism-says-musicians-union\">experienced harassment at work</a>. More than four in five did not report it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/23/artists-quitting-music-business-abuse-and-sexism-says-musicians-union\">Artists quitting music business due to abuse and sexism, says union</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The music industry has consistently struggled to reconcile its female presence with the \u201csex sells\u201d mantra at its very core, resulting in objectification at the very least and abuse at its worst. Last year, the #MeToo movement had its moment at the Golden Globes, with several high-profile actors donning black dresses in solidarity with survivors and female activists in tow. In the same year, the Grammys awkwardly skirted around the issue, uncharacteristically coy when it came to making a statement.</p> <p>Eye-contact was only briefly afforded to the elephant in the room, in the form of the white roses worn by a handful of attendees to mark their support for the Time\u2019s Up campaign. In addition, Kesha, after levelling accusations of sexual assault against producer Dr Luke, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/28/grammys-2018-bruno-mars-wins-kesha-metoo-timesup-performance\">performed a heartwrenching rendition of Praying</a>, a song widely believed to be about him. With a celebrity choir comprised of Camila Cabello, Cyndi Lauper, Bebe Rexha and others, it was rousing enough to make you momentarily forget that the original version of the song was released via Dr Luke\u2019s Kemosabe Records, because she is unable to get out of her contract. It feels as if there are far more songs that glorify sexual harassment released by record labels than there are voices within them condemning it.</p> <p>The 2018 Grammys were <a href=\"https://variety.com/2018/music/news/grammys-so-male-women-recording-academy-president-neil-portnow-1202679902/\">widely criticised for failing to recognise female achievements</a> \u2013 with only one woman even nominated in the four major categories. Which is why 2019\u2019s Grammys had an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/feb/11/diversity-wins-as-female-artists-and-hip-hop-triumph-at-grammys\">unapologetically female focus</a>. Alicia Keys hosted, bringing her \u201csisters\u201d Michelle Obama, Jennifer Lopez, Lady Gaga and Jada Pinkett Smith to the stage. And there were the female winners, from Kacey Musgraves to Cardi B, who became the first solo woman to win best rap album. These are all welcome changes, but I can\u2019t help thinking it feels more like a \u201cGirl Power\u201d-branded plaster placed on the music industry\u2019s deep-seated rot.</p> <p>Strides have been made. Off the back of the harrowing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jan/07/surviving-r-kelly-documentary-lifetime-what-we-can-learn\">Surviving R Kelly</a> documentary at the beginning of the year, several musicians have removed their collaborations with him from streaming services and Sony Music has dissolved his recording contract. In July this year, Kelly was arrested on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/12/r-kelly-arrested-on-federal-sex-trafficking-charges\">13 federal sex-trafficking charges</a>. But looking at the world in which he and artists like him have come up, it is unsurprising that his fall has taken so long. It is a culture that normalises abuse, and it is yet to be adequately challenged.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The music industry has a woman problem. It\u2019s a long-standing fact. Looking at last year\u2019s biggest hit singles in the UK, there were three times as many male as female pop stars. It lingers behind the scenes, too; women made up just 12% of songwriters and 2% of producers on the Billboard Hot 100 between 2012 and 2018. Despite years of head-scratching over the cause, one reason is hiding in plain sight. Or, perhaps it is intentionally overlooked. New figures from the Musicians\u2019 Union \u2013 which represents more than 31,000 artists, from rock musicians to orchestral players \u2013 suggests almost half of its members have experienced harassment at work. More than four in five did not report it. The music industry has consistently struggled to reconcile its female presence with the \u201csex sells\u201d mantra at its very core, resulting in objectification at the very least and abuse at its worst. Last year, the #MeToo movement had its moment at the Golden Globes, with several high-profile actors donning black dresses in solidarity with survivors and female activists in tow. In the same year, the Grammys awkwardly skirted around the issue, uncharacteristically coy when it came to making a statement. Eye-contact was only briefly afforded to the elephant in the room, in the form of the white roses worn by a handful of attendees to mark their support for the Time\u2019s Up campaign. In addition, Kesha, after levelling accusations of sexual assault against producer Dr Luke, performed a heartwrenching rendition of Praying, a song widely believed to be about him. With a celebrity choir comprised of Camila Cabello, Cyndi Lauper, Bebe Rexha and others, it was rousing enough to make you momentarily forget that the original version of the song was released via Dr Luke\u2019s Kemosabe Records, because she is unable to get out of her contract. It feels as if there are far more songs that glorify sexual harassment released by record labels than there are voices within them condemning it. The 2018 Grammys were widely criticised for failing to recognise female achievements \u2013 with only one woman even nominated in the four major categories. Which is why 2019\u2019s Grammys had an unapologetically female focus. Alicia Keys hosted, bringing her \u201csisters\u201d Michelle Obama, Jennifer Lopez, Lady Gaga and Jada Pinkett Smith to the stage. And there were the female winners, from Kacey Musgraves to Cardi B, who became the first solo woman to win best rap album. These are all welcome changes, but I can\u2019t help thinking it feels more like a \u201cGirl Power\u201d-branded plaster placed on the music industry\u2019s deep-seated rot. Strides have been made. Off the back of the harrowing Surviving R Kelly documentary at the beginning of the year, several musicians have removed their collaborations with him from streaming services and Sony Music has dissolved his recording contract. In July this year, Kelly was arrested on 13 federal sex-trafficking charges. But looking at the world in which he and artists like him have come up, it is unsurprising that his fall has taken so long. It is a culture that normalises abuse, and it is yet to be adequately challenged.",

His diligence in researching Lewis\u2019s most distant antecedents lent an authenticity to his wildest flights of the imagination, as similar efforts were to do in the books on Martin, an enigma whose Rat Pack success seemed to feed on his own utter indifference to fame and its rewards, and Liston, whose family\u2019s story he traced back to the 19th century, investigating how a black world champion came to bear a name going back to the Norman invasion of Britain, and proceeding to his mysterious death, possibly at the hands of the mafia, in Las Vegas. His love of recondite figures was displayed in Unsung Heroes of Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll (1984) and Where Dead Voices Gather (2001), the latter a richly detailed portrait of the blackface vaudevillian Emmett Miller, who embodied the dying tradition of minstrelsy. Power on Earth (1986) and King of the Jews (2001) were riffs on the lives of Michele Sindona, the corrupt Sicilian banker, and the racketeer Arnold Rothstein, the model for The Great Gatsby\u2019s Meyer Wolfsheim. His output of fiction began in 1988 with Cut Numbers, set among small-time gamblers and grifters in the milieu he had witnessed in his father\u2019s bar. Trinities (1994) portrayed the battles inside the heroin trade, In the Hand of Dante (2002) veered between the 14th century and the present day, linking the author of The Divine Comedy with a fictionalised Tosches called in to authenticate one of his manuscripts, while Under Tiberius (2015) rewrote the life of Christ through the invented memoir of a Roman functionary. All were written with an increasingly profane and reckless brio, supercharged with a dazzling breadth of references. There were various plans to turn his books into films. Ving Rhames was going to play Liston. Martin Scorsese was going to direct Dino, with Tom Hanks in the lead. Johnny Depp had bought the rights to In the Hand of Dante and was going to play Tosches. None of them would see a green light. In his later years, Tosches acquired the looks of a figure emerging from the shadows of a lost Caravaggio: part Roman senator, part southern politician with secrets. He is said to have been briefly married, to Sunny, in 1972. \u2022 Nick Tosches, biographer, novelist and poet, born 23 October 1949; died 20 October 2019",

      "bodyText": "Never let it be said that the pace of change at the Royal &amp; Ancient is anything but glacial. As the institution hurtles towards its pride and joy, the Open Championship\u2019s 150th birthday in 2021, relative revolution is in the pipeline. Five years have passed since the R&amp;A was dragged, virtually at the point of a bayonet, towards something approaching the 21st century by allowing women to become members. That time-honoured traditions (discrimination), even slower to break down at Muirfield, lasted so long is as farcical now as was the case in 2014. In early 2017, it was revealed there were still no changing facilities for females within the R&amp;A clubhouse. The R&amp;A was unrepentant about a policy whereby women had to wander up the street at St Andrews to Forgan House when seeking a shower or place of privacy to switch clothing. \u201cWe were delighted to welcome women as members of the club and made a substantial investment in our facilities to provide a modern and comfortable locker room for women members to use,\u201d said the R&amp;A at the time. \u201cForgan House is an integral part of the club and is key to the service we provide to all our members as a mixed-sex golf club.\u201d In one memorable encounter with a high-profile, enraged R&amp;A member the \u201cintellectual paucity\u201d of the article which pointed out the desperately embarrassing message given out by the locker-room situation was emphasised. He did apologise. Belatedly \u2013 and surprisingly \u2013 this scenario is to change. In a move that must be linked in part to the backlash the R&amp;A suffered almost three years ago, a female changing room is to be built into the historic clubhouse. It says everything about lingering perceptions that this is notable in the first place. \u201cWe are in the early stages of planning upgrades to the clubhouse, including the installation of women\u2019s changing rooms,\u201d a spokesman for the R&amp;A said. \u201cWe are consulting with members before we finalise our plans. There is no firm timetable but it will be a phased programme which will take us beyond 2021.\u201d The number of women among the R&amp;A\u2019s global membership of around 2,000 is unknown. Princess Anne, Laura Davies and Annika Sorenstam were among the first to gain admission. Perhaps it is unfair to castigate the R&amp;A for doing the right thing. The clubhouse, as opened in 1854, will not be a particularly easy building to modify. The enhancements will be costly. Nonetheless, it is bizarre that having admitted women to such fanfare, the delivering of equal facilities was not an immediate goal. For five years and counting the R&amp;A has been happy to portray an image of inclusivity and fairness where practicalities imply otherwise. The R&amp;A has not sought publicity for its upcoming alterations but we should not be showering it with rose petals for the delivery of equality. The vast income of the Open, as controlled by the R&amp;A\u2019s corporate wing \u2013 in which women feature prominently \u2013 means bucket collections will not be called for. The R&amp;A was a key constituent of the Women in Golf Charter, as unveiled to inspire \u201can industry-wide commitment to developing a more inclusive culture within golf around the world and enable more women and girls to flourish and maximise their potential at all levels of the sport.\u201d As recently as last year the St Andrews Town Match \u2013 where R&amp;A members and staff take on local clubs \u2013 was male only.

      "bodyText": "Freiburg have been delivered a huge blow after the Bundesliga club were told they cannot stage night games or matches between 1pm and 3pm on Sundays at their new \u20ac80m stadium, which is due to open next season, because of fears over noise. The administrative court of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg has ruled that Freiburg will be prevented from holding matches at key times in German football\u2019s schedule \u2013 deemed \u201cdaily rest periods\u201d by the state authority and anxious local residents. The court specified that \u201cgames are allowed on weekdays from 8am to 8pm and Sundays from 9am to 1pm and 3pm to 8pm\u201d. Key kick-off times in the Bundesliga affected are currently Fridays at 8.30pm, Saturdays at 6.30pm, Sundays at 1.30pm and Mondays at 8.30pm, leaving the Freiburg with just Saturday afternoon kick-off times to stage fixtures. The ruling follows protests from nearby residents of Mooswald about anticipated levels of noise at the new 34,700-capacity stadium, which is slated for completion for next summer and at a cost of around \u20ac80m, according to StadiumDB.com. In May, the club, currently sixth in the Bundesliga after eight games, beat a legal challenge to halt construction after local residents had filed a lawsuit against the building permit, citing concerns over noise and increased traffic. Freiburg\u2019s home since 1954 has been 24,000-capacity Schwarzwald-Stadion. On announcing the club\u2019s plans had been granted a planning green light two years ago, Freiberg stated: \u201cIt should become a home, support identity and do justice to the high demands of design and functionality. There are already so many great ideas and so much passion, love and effort in this stadium \u2013 imagine what it will be like when it is brought to life by Freiburg fans?\u201d",

Swietlik glows with pride at the career progression of \u201cher team\u201d, citing groomers who began on the shop floor: \u201cIn my experience, I would say about 60% of our salon managers were bred by us.\u201d</p> <p>Swietlik, who was a salon manager before being promoted, says it\u2019s increasingly difficult to find the 20 or more breeds that trainees need to practise on. \u201cMost dogs we groom now are poodle crosses: cockapoos, labradoodles, goldendoodles \u2013 they\u2019re our bread and butter, if you like. Literally 60-70% of our dogs will be like this, followed by lots of double coats.\u201d Double-coated breeds have a short undercoat that sheds regularly and range from German shepherds to pomeranians, like Marcel. One of the most popular tools to use on these breeds is the deshedding treatment, which removes dead hair, strengthens the hair follicles and reduces shedding overall. As well as coat maintenance, grooming is the perfect opportunity to check for parasites, infections, lumps and bumps, and other issues your dog may pick up over the course of its life \u2013 so it\u2019s important to make grooming part of your dog\u2019s regular healthcare.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"2b9fa1262e5c361ef2636ebea588558ed8f37fc6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b9fa1262e5c361ef2636ebea588558ed8f37fc6/0_273_1167_1458/800.jpg\" alt=\"Marcel the pomeranian being shampooed: As well as seasonal shampoos, Pets at Home also offers seasonal spa packages, such as the Halloween Spa package.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"5160f81226c25f5261327e6d18a8cdb6c2ca8be2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5160f81226c25f5261327e6d18a8cdb6c2ca8be2/1_35_805_1007/799.jpg\" alt=\"Marcel having his fur trimmed\" width=\"799\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"aad91c31d5931fe1e89836922e96b50aaa8cf9e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aad91c31d5931fe1e89836922e96b50aaa8cf9e2/0_204_1167_1458/800.jpg\" alt=\"190924 Inside The Dog Groomers Project#5 Shot 04 033\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"4e8388158ca44e9ca7c6e2a5c0ca3b1380f42286\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e8388158ca44e9ca7c6e2a5c0ca3b1380f42286/0_120_1167_1458/800.jpg\" alt=\"Marcel after being groomed\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>A shampoo and a trim leaves Marcel\u2019s coat in top condition</p></li> </ul> <p>After two shampoos \u2013 one to remove the dirt \u2013 Marcel\u2019s conditioner is left to do its work for five minutes.

But all dogs enjoy different things \u2013 one could love a facial but hate being brushed, like Marcel. \u201cIt\u2019s personal with dogs, just like with humans, but most of them really like the attention,\u201d she says. For those that don\u2019t \u2013 perhaps due to previous experiences elsewhere \u2013 there are shorter treatments to ease them in, or quiet sessions on a Sunday before the rest of the store is open.

She finishes the drying swiftly and lets him sit on her lap while she finishes brushing out his fur.</p> <p>Now Marcel\u2019s owner has returned, Swietlik has some tips to make grooming better for them both. But first she starts off with asking what food the pooch is on \u2013 if your dog isn\u2019t eating the right food, she would usually recommend a nutrition consultation with a colleague. \u201cYou could try adding fish or cod-liver oil to his diet to keep his coat soft,\u201d she says, adding that a hydrated coat is easier to brush. The direction of shampooing and brushing is also key: \u201cIf you go from the front you will be brushing over the top of the tangles underneath, plus most dogs are more sensitive at the back so it\u2019s best to get it over with first.\u201d And if that doesn\u2019t work? \u201cBribery!

The tech firm\u2019s rival, IBM, was swift to dismiss the excitement. Google has not, it asserts, achieved the highly prized goal of quantum supremacy.</p> <p>Google <a href=\"https://nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1666-5\">published its claim</a> in the journal Nature on Wednesday after an earlier report on the work appeared briefly on a Nasa website last month. The paper describes how a team led by John Martinis, leader of the research team working on quantum supremacy, built a superconducting quantum processor named Sycamore that harnesses the weirdness of quantum physics to crunch through thorny problems.</p> <p>To demonstrate the device\u2019s computational prowess, the scientists set it the deeply contrived task of checking the randomness of a sequence of numbers.

Writing in the journal, the authors state: \u201cTo our knowledge, this experiment marks the first computation that can be performed only on a quantum processor. Quantum processors have thus reached the regime of quantum supremacy.\u201d</p> <p>Not so, say the IBM researchers. In a <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2019/10/on-quantum-supremacy/\">blogpost</a> written in response to the work, they argue that the Oak Ridge supercomputer could solve the randomness problem in 2.5 days, perhaps less, depending on how it was programmed. They add that because \u201cquantum supremacy\u201d requires a quantum computer to solve a problem that is beyond a classical computer, Google\u2019s claim does not hold up.</p> <p>\u201cGoogle\u2019s experiment is an excellent demonstration of the progress in superconducting-based quantum computing,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2019/10/on-quantum-supremacy/\">the IBM scientists argue</a>. \u201cBut it should not be viewed as proof that quantum computers are \u2018supreme\u2019 over classical computers.\u201d</p> <p>Standard computers and quantum computers are radically different. While standard computers perform calculations with \u201cbits\u201d, which must be either 0 or 1, quantum computers have \u201cqubits\u201d that can take any value between 0 and 1. Another quirk of quantum physics allows qubits to be \u201centangled\u201d such that the value of one is tied to the values of those around it. Make a quantum computer that is stable enough \u2013 a tough enough feat in itself \u2013 and it can, in principle, explore multiple solutions to a problem at once.</p> <p>Since the advent of the first experimental qubits, tech firms have been racing to demonstrate what the US physicist John Preskill dubbed \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/02/quantum-supremacy-computers\">quantum supremacy</a>\u201d. Preskill coined the phrase to define the turning point in computing history when quantum computers showed their true potential by trouncing standard machines.</p> <p>Google\u2019s Sycamore processor used 53 qubits to plough through the arcane task its masters gave it. According to Pichai, the breakthrough is a step towards using quantum computers to solve real-world problems, such as creating new drugs, designing more efficient batteries, and making fertilisers with less energy. \u201cWe\u2019ve already peeled away from classical computers, on to a totally different trajectory,\u201d a Google spokesperson said.</p> <p>Asked about IBM\u2019s reaction to the achievement, Sergio Boixo on the Google team said: \u201cIt\u2019s very important to test the proposals on real supercomputers, because things don\u2019t always work as expected.\u201d Martinis added: \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to having them look at our data and validate our results some more.\u201d</p> <p>Christopher Monroe, a physicist at the University of Maryland and co-founder of the quantum computing startup IonQ, said Google\u2019s paper might be a milestone in quantum computing, but it was an academic one. \u201cThe problem is not likely to be useful for anything, except showing something that appears to be really hard using normal computers,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But work towards <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/02/quantum-supremacy-computers\">useful quantum computers</a> was \u201cmarching along\u201d, Monroe added, saying the devices were likely to help solve a raft of problems, from logistics to understanding the structures of large molecules. \u201cProblems like this can only be solved on a quantum computer,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Steve Brierley, CEO of the Cambridge-based quantum software company Riverlane, said: \u201cIt\u2019s clearly an amazing achievement. I think this is going to be one of those moments when people look back and say, \u2018That was the time that really changed this field of quantum computing.\u2019 It is also a great moment in time to stop talking about quantum supremacy, which has unfortunate historical connotations, and move on to talking about quantum advantage, which has a useful application.\u201d</p> <p>In an accompanying article in Nature, William Oliver, a physicist at MIT, compares Google\u2019s achievement to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/picture/2012/dec/17/wright-brothers-first-flight\">first flights of the Wright brothers</a>. The Wright Flyer was not the first airborne vehicle to fly, nor did it solve any pressing problem, but it demonstrated a radical new possibility, the implications of which became clear only decades later. \u201cIt is what the event represented, rather than what it practically accomplished, that was paramount.

And in certain cases that could threaten public health.\u201d A spokesperson from the Responsible Use of Medicines in Agriculture (Ruma) Alliance said UK farmers and vets had almost halved antibiotic use since 2013 and now had some of the lowest use in Europe. \u201cThey have worked transparently with the Veterinary Medicines Directorate while doing thi,s and have achieved change responsibly through improving animal health and welfare as well as facilities and biosecurity. We are encouraged that at the same time as these reductions are happening at farm level, antibiotic-resistant bacteria found in farm animal surveillance are staying static or starting to fall,\u201d said the spokesperson. Elizabeth Andoh-Kesson, a food policy adviser at the British Retail Consortium, which represents a number of UK supermarkets, said: \u201cBRC members work closely with farmers and suppliers and advocate the principles set by Ruma to ensure antibiotics are responsibly used in food production. Suppliers must follow all legal requirements on the acceptable use of antibiotics, balancing animal welfare with the reduction and refinement of antibiotic use in UK agriculture.\u201d A spokesperson for Tesco said: \u201cAll our UK chicken suppliers meet the strict legal requirements on antibiotic residues, and we are working closely with our suppliers to reduce antibiotic use across our supply chain without compromising on animal welfare.\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s deferred to Moy Park\u2019s statement, but added that it also ran routine tests on antibiotic residues. Ocado said it did not wish to add anything beyond the BRC statement. A spokesperson for the Northern Ireland Department of health said: \u201cThese matters form part of an ongoing multi-agency investigation led by the Department of Health\u2019s medicines regulatory group in pursuance of offences under the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 and the Veterinary Medicines Regulations 2013. Daera, under its statutory role in the surveillance and sampling for veterinary medicine residues in food producing animals, is providing assistance to the investigation. As this case is ongoing the department cannot comment further at this time.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>On the morning of 14 November 1994, a train glided into the Gare du Nord in Paris. It had left London Waterloo three hours earlier with around 700 passengers, then meandered \u2013 frustratingly slowly in those days \u2013 through Kent. Near Folkestone it dived underground, into a tunnel bored through the chalk under the seabed, before emerging 20 minutes later near Calais, where it could at last accelerate to 186mph and finally arrive at the French capital three minutes ahead of schedule. Or rather late, perhaps, depending on how you look at it.</p> <p>After all, it was nearly two centuries earlier, in 1802, that a French mining engineer named Albert Mathieu-Favier first proposed the idea of a tunnel under the Channel. It involved horse-drawn carriages and oil lamps and was quickly abandoned. Numerous other ideas and schemes followed; surveys were carried out and tunnels were even started. Digging began in 1881, but the project was ditched when British politicians and the press stirred up fears of an invasion.</p> <p>Just over a century later, in 1986, an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/21/world/britain-and-france-announce-plans-for-rail-tunnel-under-the-channel.html\">agreement between France and Britain to build the tunnel</a> was signed in the presence of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and Margaret Thatcher. Digging began from both sides in 1988; on 1 December 1990, two miners, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5V-Hks0oDM\" title=\"\">Englishman Graham Fagg and Frenchman Philippe Cozette</a>, broke through the service tunnel and shook hands. A further four years later, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/1994/may/06/railtravel.wonders.channeltunnel\">high-speed trains were running through the tunnel</a>.</p> <p>Since then over 200 million passengers have travelled on the Eurostar \u2013 including the Queen, presidents, prime ministers, Beatles and Rolling Stones, ambassadors, Wags, fans, and a lot of ordinary people. I spoke to some of those passengers, and the people who helped them travel.</p> <h2>I drove the first train to Paris</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"199d2e83772ed1982b06a43910ec0703c4529f47\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/199d2e83772ed1982b06a43910ec0703c4529f47/0_160_2416_1449/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bob Priston and Eurostar engine\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I thought, blimey, that\u2019s a lot of pressure\u2019 ... Bob Priston.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eurostar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My co-driver Lionel Stevenson and I were told the Friday before that we were rostered on the first train to Paris. I thought: \u201cBlimey, that\u2019s a lot of pressure,\u201d but we were well trained and ready to go. The day went very fast. We left Waterloo within a minute of the right time, had a pretty clear run and in northern France we accelerated to 300kmh. We were aware that it was a historic moment \u2013 that if anything went wrong, that\u2019s what would be reported.</p> <p>Before that I was an InterCity driver on British Rail. The Eurostar train is a lot faster; we loved that, but it was something we had to get used to. Then there were the different signalling systems; French and Belgian rules and regulations. We were given 600 hours of French language training, including two residential stays in France.</p> <p>It always gives you a buzz, going into the tunnel, especially if you get slowed down on the approach and then accelerate into the tunnel. We don\u2019t get much overtaking us. The nearest I\u2019ve come to it was many years ago when there was a 170kph speed restriction in France. There was a BMW on the left-hand side, just in front of the train. As we came off the speed restriction I looked over and he was accelerating at the same rate, up to about 250-260kph, before I gently eased past him.</p> <p>We had a couple of stowaways once. They were on the outside of the train and were spotted as we left Lille for London. There are a number of places \u2013 without giving too much away \u2013 where you can wedge yourself in. As we approached Calais I was told we would stop and the French police took them away.</p> <p>And I have had a couple of fatalities. It\u2019s not a pleasant side of the job. It takes a while to get your head around. The company provides counsellors. There\u2019s nothing we can do about it \u2013 that\u2019s the starting place for dealing with it, but it\u2019s not pleasant, especially when you find out a bit about the people involved.</p> <p><em>Bob Priston,</em><em> train driver</em><strong>.</strong></p> <h2>I met my husband on the Eurostar</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b920f9ddc3c4ed2216709bfecd026c978336a4c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b920f9ddc3c4ed2216709bfecd026c978336a4c5/0_2018_3792_2842/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jenny and Chris Wheeler at their wedding\" width=\"1000\" height=\"749\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I thought, I\u2019m going to take a chance\u2019 ...

I had come to the UK with one suitcase, but when it was time to go back I had three, so I left some behind. I was on my final trip from Paris to London to pick up the last suitcase when I met my husband. He was on a business trip and wasn\u2019t even supposed to be on that train \u2013 he had just missed the previous one. I did notice him in the queue, but he wasn\u2019t my type, if I\u2019m honest \u2013 although there was something nice about him. Then, when I came to sit next to him on the train, I thought: \u201cOh, it\u2019s that guy.\u201d</p> <p>We both had Discmans and that was probably the start of the conversation: \u201cOoh, what are you listening to?\u201d I was probably listening to PJ Harvey and Radiohead \u2013 he was more dance. He\u2019s a DJ at heart, even if he has to work in the City.</p> <p>He offered me a beer. I think I spilled a bit on him. I offered him a Bonne Maman chocolate tartlet \u2013 it\u2019s really cliched! We were talking in English for the first hour and a half, then suddenly he spoke French. He had kept that one quiet. I was quite impressed. It was a fun three hours. I didn\u2019t think \u201cI\u2019m falling in love\u201d, but we exchanged numbers.</p> <p>I told my friends how I had met this guy, he was nice, carried my suitcase \u2013 the embodiment of the proper Englishman. They said, you\u2019ve got to call him. I went back to Paris and we arranged to meet, because he was coming to Paris again. We went to one of those bars opposite Gare du Nord. I went to the UK maybe a couple of weeks later, to see him. We got on so well I decided to move in. I had quite a good job in Paris, but I thought: \u201cI\u2019m still young, I\u2019m going to take a chance.\u201d</p> <p><em>Jenny Wheeler</em><em> lives with Chris and their two children on the Essex/Suffolk border.</em></p> <h2>I helped build the tunnel</h2> <p>I\u2019m actually sitting on the Eurostar right now, leaving in seven minutes. I was public affairs manager for Eurotunnel, involved in the tunnel and the start of services. I\u2019ve been following it ever since. In 1980 or 81 Margaret Thatcher indicated that if a fixed link across the Channel could be built and financed without public money, then we could do it. We had people from <a href=\"https://www.doverport.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Dover Harbour Board</a> saying the tunnel was going to be the longest crematorium in the world \u2013 we had to struggle against that.</p> <p>The decision to make it a rail tunnel was very significant. Some of the alpine road tunnels have had lots of problems, as well as the issues of exhaust emissions. But Mrs Thatcher didn\u2019t like trains, she liked cars. When she asked our chairman how you get the cars across, he said: \u201cOh, you put them on shuttles,\u201d and she never asked what a shuttle was. Of course, it was a train.</p> <p>I always thought it was an important way of linking us to the continent \u2013 not just business, but pleasure and culture. The train has helped integrate communities in a way that didn\u2019t happen before. That\u2019s what\u2019s so sad about Brexit: they are doing their best to wreck it.</p> <p><em>Anthony Fitzhardinge Gueterbock, Lord Berkeley</em><em>.</em></p> <h2>The Eurostar is at the centre of my marriage</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1416d5ac0c2f6952f01f4b4123da31c7714f72fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1416d5ac0c2f6952f01f4b4123da31c7714f72fe/0_264_2448_3000/816.jpg\" alt=\"Backwards and forwards at weekends ...

We met by chance in a London bar \u2013 I was a sociology student at Brunel University on a girls\u2019 night out. We married in 2010. I live in London and he lives in Paris. We travel by Eurostar backwards and forwards to see each other at weekends. He comes twice a month, I go one weekend over there, or I stay longer because I have more flexibility. I do an art course and even did a big model of the Eurostar, with pictures of myself and Antoine inside.</p> <p><em>Bryony Hoskins is a professor of comparative social science at the University of Roehampton.</em></p> <h2>I was a passenger on the first train to Paris</h2> <p>The most disappointing thing was that you never actually saw the sea: it\u2019s because of the way the tunnel had to start in front of a hill on the British side and takes you quite a way beyond Calais. It\u2019s a brilliant piece of railway engineering: I\u2019ve travelled in the cab, an amazing experience. But the other great disappointment is that Brexit has happened. Despite the fact you can hop on the Eurostar and end up in France, it hasn\u2019t made us feel more European. As a railway person I\u2019m loath to say it, but maybe it<strong> </strong>would have been better if you could have driven across. It might have made for more casual connections.</p> <p>It\u2019s undoubtedly the best way to travel between London, Paris and Brussels. But if you want to go to Amsterdam it only works one way round. Eurostar doesn\u2019t sell tickets to many destinations either, so it\u2019s<strong> </strong>not really connecting us to lots of places in Europe. Kent is one of the most pro-Brexit areas. If they had connected France with England on that kind of level it would have done enormous amounts for European relations. Instead it\u2019s almost like taking a plane \u2013 you have to go to St Pancras or Ashford International, through security. If you go from France to Belgium or France to Italy you just hop on a train or in the car and you\u2019re there.</p> <p>You can\u2019t blame Brexit on Eurostar, but it could have done more to prevent it. It has missed an opportunity \u2013 politically, symbolically and culturally.</p> <p><em>Christian Wolmar</em><em>, writer and railway historian</em><em>.</em></p> <h2>I commute on the Eurostar</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"08745dd37c30a5ee8307f5f26cb3a55159a2b801\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08745dd37c30a5ee8307f5f26cb3a55159a2b801/0_110_750_450/500.jpg\" alt=\"Boulogne-based ...

Just the site alone was something like \u00a3600,000. It was a clear day and we could see France \u2013 that sort of piqued our interest. I do a lot of urban design, using maps to analyse how close things are in time, rather than distance. If you put a pin in King\u2019s Cross \u2013 where my wife Bernice and I both work \u2013 in one of these interactive maps, most of northern France is closer in time than most of south-east England: Eurostar stretches northern France into what would, timewise, be considered a suburb of London. It\u2019s 55 minutes to Calais-Fr\u00e9thun. So we came over for the weekend, looked at eight properties and chose the fourth \u2013 in the old town of Boulogne, between the cathedral and the castle.</p> <p>We both run our own businesses and commute every day or weekly, as we see fit. Obviously it\u2019s expensive; if I did it every day it would be double or triple what I would pay for a Brighton season ticket \u2013 but you would need several lifetimes of that before you got near the cost of property differential. I used to come up from Brighton and sit in someone\u2019s armpit \u2013 if the train worked at all. In general I would say the prices in northern France are 10% of south-east England\u2019s: not 10% <em>off</em>, 10% <em>of</em>. The house next door to ours, once occupied by the writer Alain-Ren\u00e9 Lesage, who wrote Gil Blas, just sold for 40,000 euros.</p> <p>We spend our weekends walking on the beautiful beaches, cliffs and dunes of the C\u00f4te d\u2019Opale national park and eating some of the best seafood in Europe.</p> <p><em>Harry Dobbs,</em><em> Boulogne.</em></p> <h2>My train broke down for a night<strong> </strong></h2> <p>I commute weekly between Brussels and London, and in November 2014 I was on a train that broke down in northern France, en route to Brussels. After a while the power went out; it was around 9pm and we were sitting in darkness. It quickly became apparent we would be stuck for a long time. Everyone made a dash for the bar, which sold out in about 20 minutes. It was cold outside, but when the aircon broke the carriage warmed up. The problem was that the train was on a bend and tilted, which meant we were all leaning to the right (or the left if facing backwards). In the end we spent the whole night on the train, trying to sleep, while leaning to the right.</p> <p>Finally we were towed away by another train and arrived in Brussels at 6am \u2013 nine hours late. The woman next to me listened to nothing but Coldplay (loudly) during the delay. Everyone\u2019s phone batteries started to run out except hers, which went on for ever. It was a very long night.</p> <p><em>Paul, who lives in Brussels and works in London</em><em>.</em></p> <h2> I had sex on the Eurostar and founded the 45 Metre Underground Club</h2> <p>I was with my girlfriend \u2013 it was 2011, we hadn\u2019t been going out long. It was a morning train. I think we did have a drink on the train, but we were very much in control of our senses. I had the idea as we were heading out of St Pancras. She didn\u2019t take much persuasion: it was a sort of pioneering thing. I imagine we weren\u2019t the first to do it, but we were the first to do it in the spirit of this new club we wanted to set up.</p> <p>The Mile High Club is aspirational: what could be sexier and naughtier than sex on a plane? But now flight shame puts the Mile High Club in a different light. The 45 Metre Underground Club is the low-carbon option. But you have to be doing it when you are under the Channel.</p> <p>Honestly, I think we were in there for about five or 10 minutes, before emerging gingerly but extremely pleased with ourselves. I would absolutely recommend it. There is a huge body of water above you, you are hurtling along at high speed through a dark tunnel under the Channel, knowing you are on a low-carbon adventure.</p> <p><em>Matt Mellen, founder of the <a href=\"https://ecohustler.com/\">Ecohustler online magazine</a>, lives in Frome, Somerset.</em> </p> <h2>My train hit a wild boar</h2> <p>One cold November evening I boarded a 7pm train at St Pancras. The journey proceeded through the tunnel, across the flat French countryside and I was looking forward to checking into my hotel. Suddenly there was a loud bang, followed by an all-consuming scraping noise that seemed to go on for ever. Eventually we ground to a halt.</p> <p>We saw train staff wandering around outside with torches. After an hour, we finally started up again. There was a very loud grinding noise, then we stopped. After two to three hours of further waiting, we finally had an announcement: \u201cYour Eurostar has hit a wild boar and is badly damaged.\u201d They didn\u2019t tell us what happened to the boar, but I guess that at 180mph it had probably been quite badly damaged too.</p> <p>Time passed: another two hours; three hours. But the bar was open and the wifi was working. We were stuck, but it was comfortable. Eventually, at about 4am, they commandeered another train and towed our broken Eurostar into a nearby station at about 10mph. We finally made it into Paris shortly after 8am, where they left us with a free breakfast, huge apologies, a full refund and tickets for another free trip.</p> <p><em>Chris Allen lives in Suffolk.</em></p> <h2>I sat next to the England Wags</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9fb9a3eca33197a05d1884d4d88ae9b04ebb6328\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9fb9a3eca33197a05d1884d4d88ae9b04ebb6328/141_0_2931_1758/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wives And girlfriends of the England football team, World Cup 1998.

The train got almost to the tunnel, had a problem and had to turn back to London. Eventually we were all bussed to a hotel near Wembley stadium. The following morning I insisted on a place on an early train. I had a first-class ticket and argued I should be able to get back to work asap. Eventually I was given a ticket rather grudgingly and collected a free copy of the Daily Telegraph at Waterloo. Before boarding I read an illustrated article about the England football team\u2019s wives. This was before the term \u201cWags\u201d was in use, but it was the World Cup and that evening England were playing Argentina. When I found my carriage a man tried to stop me boarding, saying the carriage was fully booked, but I insisted on getting on. The carriage had few people in it, all women under 35, very well dressed.</p> <p>My seat was at a table of four. The three women all knew each other, and another seated across the aisle. I offered to swap places so they could sit together. Gradually it dawned on me this was a carriage reserved for the wives and girlfriends of the England team. I remember recognising Paul Scholes\u2019s wife from the picture. I think Victoria Beckham was the only one not present. They were very jolly. I thought the last thing they wanted was a male trying to engage in conversation. I would just sit back and tell my mates about it. At Lille they all departed, exiting the carriage in a wave of expensive fragrance.</p> <p><em>Tom, who did not wish to give his surname.</em> <em>England lost to Argentina on penalties.</em></p> <h2>I am the French ambassador</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f58710bc9f4b4e934d3eb9945c6373fb9d6e7087\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f58710bc9f4b4e934d3eb9945c6373fb9d6e7087/0_407_6240_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Catherine Colonna on her visit to Dover and Folkestone\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I always take the Eurostar\u2019 ...

Seeing it made me think that great vision is needed in politics. There had been talk about it for so long, but they actually decided to do it. And it works. It is the easiest, safest, most ecological way from the UK to France and the continent. I always take the Eurostar. It symbolises that we are so close to each other. When I visited Dover, you could see France from the cliffs. It\u2019s not my job to make predictions, but I can\u2019t say I think much will change.

      "bodyText": "On the morning of 14 November 1994, a train glided into the Gare du Nord in Paris. It had left London Waterloo three hours earlier with around 700 passengers, then meandered \u2013 frustratingly slowly in those days \u2013 through Kent. Near Folkestone it dived underground, into a tunnel bored through the chalk under the seabed, before emerging 20 minutes later near Calais, where it could at last accelerate to 186mph and finally arrive at the French capital three minutes ahead of schedule. Or rather late, perhaps, depending on how you look at it. After all, it was nearly two centuries earlier, in 1802, that a French mining engineer named Albert Mathieu-Favier first proposed the idea of a tunnel under the Channel. It involved horse-drawn carriages and oil lamps and was quickly abandoned. Numerous other ideas and schemes followed; surveys were carried out and tunnels were even started. Digging began in 1881, but the project was ditched when British politicians and the press stirred up fears of an invasion. Just over a century later, in 1986, an agreement between France and Britain to build the tunnel was signed in the presence of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and Margaret Thatcher. Digging began from both sides in 1988; on 1 December 1990, two miners, Englishman Graham Fagg and Frenchman Philippe Cozette, broke through the service tunnel and shook hands. A further four years later, high-speed trains were running through the tunnel. Since then over 200 million passengers have travelled on the Eurostar \u2013 including the Queen, presidents, prime ministers, Beatles and Rolling Stones, ambassadors, Wags, fans, and a lot of ordinary people. I spoke to some of those passengers, and the people who helped them travel. I drove the first train to Paris My co-driver Lionel Stevenson and I were told the Friday before that we were rostered on the first train to Paris. I thought: \u201cBlimey, that\u2019s a lot of pressure,\u201d but we were well trained and ready to go. The day went very fast. We left Waterloo within a minute of the right time, had a pretty clear run and in northern France we accelerated to 300kmh. We were aware that it was a historic moment \u2013 that if anything went wrong, that\u2019s what would be reported. Before that I was an InterCity driver on British Rail. The Eurostar train is a lot faster; we loved that, but it was something we had to get used to. Then there were the different signalling systems; French and Belgian rules and regulations. We were given 600 hours of French language training, including two residential stays in France. It always gives you a buzz, going into the tunnel, especially if you get slowed down on the approach and then accelerate into the tunnel. We don\u2019t get much overtaking us. The nearest I\u2019ve come to it was many years ago when there was a 170kph speed restriction in France. There was a BMW on the left-hand side, just in front of the train. As we came off the speed restriction I looked over and he was accelerating at the same rate, up to about 250-260kph, before I gently eased past him. We had a couple of stowaways once. They were on the outside of the train and were spotted as we left Lille for London. There are a number of places \u2013 without giving too much away \u2013 where you can wedge yourself in. As we approached Calais I was told we would stop and the French police took them away. And I have had a couple of fatalities. It\u2019s not a pleasant side of the job. It takes a while to get your head around. The company provides counsellors. There\u2019s nothing we can do about it \u2013 that\u2019s the starting place for dealing with it, but it\u2019s not pleasant, especially when you find out a bit about the people involved. Bob Priston, train driver. I met my husband on the Eurostar In 2002 I was studying English and went to live in London, but eventually ran out of money and had to go home to Paris. I had come to the UK with one suitcase, but when it was time to go back I had three, so I left some behind. I was on my final trip from Paris to London to pick up the last suitcase when I met my husband. He was on a business trip and wasn\u2019t even supposed to be on that train \u2013 he had just missed the previous one. I did notice him in the queue, but he wasn\u2019t my type, if I\u2019m honest \u2013 although there was something nice about him. Then, when I came to sit next to him on the train, I thought: \u201cOh, it\u2019s that guy.\u201d We both had Discmans and that was probably the start of the conversation: \u201cOoh, what are you listening to?\u201d I was probably listening to PJ Harvey and Radiohead \u2013 he was more dance. He\u2019s a DJ at heart, even if he has to work in the City. He offered me a beer. I think I spilled a bit on him. I offered him a Bonne Maman chocolate tartlet \u2013 it\u2019s really cliched! We were talking in English for the first hour and a half, then suddenly he spoke French. He had kept that one quiet. I was quite impressed. It was a fun three hours. I didn\u2019t think \u201cI\u2019m falling in love\u201d, but we exchanged numbers. I told my friends how I had met this guy, he was nice, carried my suitcase \u2013 the embodiment of the proper Englishman. They said, you\u2019ve got to call him. I went back to Paris and we arranged to meet, because he was coming to Paris again. We went to one of those bars opposite Gare du Nord. I went to the UK maybe a couple of weeks later, to see him. We got on so well I decided to move in. I had quite a good job in Paris, but I thought: \u201cI\u2019m still young, I\u2019m going to take a chance.\u201d Jenny Wheeler lives with Chris and their two children on the Essex/Suffolk border. I helped build the tunnel I\u2019m actually sitting on the Eurostar right now, leaving in seven minutes. I was public affairs manager for Eurotunnel, involved in the tunnel and the start of services. I\u2019ve been following it ever since. In 1980 or 81 Margaret Thatcher indicated that if a fixed link across the Channel could be built and financed without public money, then we could do it. We had people from Dover Harbour Board saying the tunnel was going to be the longest crematorium in the world \u2013 we had to struggle against that. The decision to make it a rail tunnel was very significant. Some of the alpine road tunnels have had lots of problems, as well as the issues of exhaust emissions. But Mrs Thatcher didn\u2019t like trains, she liked cars. When she asked our chairman how you get the cars across, he said: \u201cOh, you put them on shuttles,\u201d and she never asked what a shuttle was. Of course, it was a train. I always thought it was an important way of linking us to the continent \u2013 not just business, but pleasure and culture. The train has helped integrate communities in a way that didn\u2019t happen before. That\u2019s what\u2019s so sad about Brexit: they are doing their best to wreck it. Anthony Fitzhardinge Gueterbock, Lord Berkeley. The Eurostar is at the centre of my marriage Antoine was a software engineer who came to the UK when they were building the tunnel under London in about 1998. We met by chance in a London bar \u2013 I was a sociology student at Brunel University on a girls\u2019 night out. We married in 2010. I live in London and he lives in Paris. We travel by Eurostar backwards and forwards to see each other at weekends. He comes twice a month, I go one weekend over there, or I stay longer because I have more flexibility. I do an art course and even did a big model of the Eurostar, with pictures of myself and Antoine inside. Bryony Hoskins is a professor of comparative social science at the University of Roehampton. I was a passenger on the first train to Paris The most disappointing thing was that you never actually saw the sea: it\u2019s because of the way the tunnel had to start in front of a hill on the British side and takes you quite a way beyond Calais. It\u2019s a brilliant piece of railway engineering: I\u2019ve travelled in the cab, an amazing experience. But the other great disappointment is that Brexit has happened. Despite the fact you can hop on the Eurostar and end up in France, it hasn\u2019t made us feel more European. As a railway person I\u2019m loath to say it, but maybe it would have been better if you could have driven across. It might have made for more casual connections. It\u2019s undoubtedly the best way to travel between London, Paris and Brussels. But if you want to go to Amsterdam it only works one way round. Eurostar doesn\u2019t sell tickets to many destinations either, so it\u2019s not really connecting us to lots of places in Europe. Kent is one of the most pro-Brexit areas. If they had connected France with England on that kind of level it would have done enormous amounts for European relations. Instead it\u2019s almost like taking a plane \u2013 you have to go to St Pancras or Ashford International, through security. If you go from France to Belgium or France to Italy you just hop on a train or in the car and you\u2019re there. You can\u2019t blame Brexit on Eurostar, but it could have done more to prevent it. It has missed an opportunity \u2013 politically, symbolically and culturally. Christian Wolmar, writer and railway historian. I commute on the Eurostar I\u2019m an architect and my wife and I were looking at a site to build a property by the sea near Rye. Just the site alone was something like \u00a3600,000. It was a clear day and we could see France \u2013 that sort of piqued our interest. I do a lot of urban design, using maps to analyse how close things are in time, rather than distance. If you put a pin in King\u2019s Cross \u2013 where my wife Bernice and I both work \u2013 in one of these interactive maps, most of northern France is closer in time than most of south-east England: Eurostar stretches northern France into what would, timewise, be considered a suburb of London. It\u2019s 55 minutes to Calais-Fr\u00e9thun. So we came over for the weekend, looked at eight properties and chose the fourth \u2013 in the old town of Boulogne, between the cathedral and the castle. We both run our own businesses and commute every day or weekly, as we see fit. Obviously it\u2019s expensive; if I did it every day it would be double or triple what I would pay for a Brighton season ticket \u2013 but you would need several lifetimes of that before you got near the cost of property differential. I used to come up from Brighton and sit in someone\u2019s armpit \u2013 if the train worked at all. In general I would say the prices in northern France are 10% of south-east England\u2019s: not 10% off, 10% of. The house next door to ours, once occupied by the writer Alain-Ren\u00e9 Lesage, who wrote Gil Blas, just sold for 40,000 euros. We spend our weekends walking on the beautiful beaches, cliffs and dunes of the C\u00f4te d\u2019Opale national park and eating some of the best seafood in Europe. Harry Dobbs, Boulogne. My train broke down for a night I commute weekly between Brussels and London, and in November 2014 I was on a train that broke down in northern France, en route to Brussels. After a while the power went out; it was around 9pm and we were sitting in darkness. It quickly became apparent we would be stuck for a long time. Everyone made a dash for the bar, which sold out in about 20 minutes. It was cold outside, but when the aircon broke the carriage warmed up. The problem was that the train was on a bend and tilted, which meant we were all leaning to the right (or the left if facing backwards). In the end we spent the whole night on the train, trying to sleep, while leaning to the right. Finally we were towed away by another train and arrived in Brussels at 6am \u2013 nine hours late. The woman next to me listened to nothing but Coldplay (loudly) during the delay. Everyone\u2019s phone batteries started to run out except hers, which went on for ever. It was a very long night. Paul, who lives in Brussels and works in London. I had sex on the Eurostar and founded the 45 Metre Underground Club I was with my girlfriend \u2013 it was 2011, we hadn\u2019t been going out long. It was a morning train. I think we did have a drink on the train, but we were very much in control of our senses. I had the idea as we were heading out of St Pancras. She didn\u2019t take much persuasion: it was a sort of pioneering thing. I imagine we weren\u2019t the first to do it, but we were the first to do it in the spirit of this new club we wanted to set up. The Mile High Club is aspirational: what could be sexier and naughtier than sex on a plane? But now flight shame puts the Mile High Club in a different light. The 45 Metre Underground Club is the low-carbon option. But you have to be doing it when you are under the Channel. Honestly, I think we were in there for about five or 10 minutes, before emerging gingerly but extremely pleased with ourselves. I would absolutely recommend it. There is a huge body of water above you, you are hurtling along at high speed through a dark tunnel under the Channel, knowing you are on a low-carbon adventure. Matt Mellen, founder of the Ecohustler online magazine, lives in Frome, Somerset. My train hit a wild boar One cold November evening I boarded a 7pm train at St Pancras. The journey proceeded through the tunnel, across the flat French countryside and I was looking forward to checking into my hotel. Suddenly there was a loud bang, followed by an all-consuming scraping noise that seemed to go on for ever. Eventually we ground to a halt. We saw train staff wandering around outside with torches. After an hour, we finally started up again. There was a very loud grinding noise, then we stopped. After two to three hours of further waiting, we finally had an announcement: \u201cYour Eurostar has hit a wild boar and is badly damaged.\u201d They didn\u2019t tell us what happened to the boar, but I guess that at 180mph it had probably been quite badly damaged too. Time passed: another two hours; three hours. But the bar was open and the wifi was working. We were stuck, but it was comfortable. Eventually, at about 4am, they commandeered another train and towed our broken Eurostar into a nearby station at about 10mph. We finally made it into Paris shortly after 8am, where they left us with a free breakfast, huge apologies, a full refund and tickets for another free trip. Chris Allen lives in Suffolk. I sat next to the England Wags I was returning home to Brussels in 1998. The train got almost to the tunnel, had a problem and had to turn back to London. Eventually we were all bussed to a hotel near Wembley stadium. The following morning I insisted on a place on an early train. I had a first-class ticket and argued I should be able to get back to work asap. Eventually I was given a ticket rather grudgingly and collected a free copy of the Daily Telegraph at Waterloo. Before boarding I read an illustrated article about the England football team\u2019s wives. This was before the term \u201cWags\u201d was in use, but it was the World Cup and that evening England were playing Argentina. When I found my carriage a man tried to stop me boarding, saying the carriage was fully booked, but I insisted on getting on. The carriage had few people in it, all women under 35, very well dressed. My seat was at a table of four. The three women all knew each other, and another seated across the aisle. I offered to swap places so they could sit together. Gradually it dawned on me this was a carriage reserved for the wives and girlfriends of the England team. I remember recognising Paul Scholes\u2019s wife from the picture. I think Victoria Beckham was the only one not present. They were very jolly. I thought the last thing they wanted was a male trying to engage in conversation. I would just sit back and tell my mates about it. At Lille they all departed, exiting the carriage in a wave of expensive fragrance. Tom, who did not wish to give his surname. England lost to Argentina on penalties. I am the French ambassador A few days after my arrival in September I went to Dover to see the traffic and the harbour \u2013 preparedness, shall we say, on the English side, for various scenarios. I went to Folkestone as well. In the operations centre there is a photograph of Mme Thatcher and President Mitterrand when they signed that agreement in 1986. Seeing it made me think that great vision is needed in politics. There had been talk about it for so long, but they actually decided to do it. And it works. It is the easiest, safest, most ecological way from the UK to France and the continent. I always take the Eurostar. It symbolises that we are so close to each other. When I visited Dover, you could see France from the cliffs. It\u2019s not my job to make predictions, but I can\u2019t say I think much will change. My guess is just as many people will travel from one country to the other, as before. The Channel will not become wider overnight. Catherine Colonna is France\u2019s ambassador to the UK. I wore a banana-yellow jacket to serve drunk rugby fans, the wrong Rolling Stone and the right Beatle I served on the Eurostar for two summers, 1998 and 99, to pay off my student debts. I went to the interview thinking I could speak fluent French, but completely froze. They still gave me the job. We had to be on the platform an hour and 15 minutes before departure to get the train ready. We had these banana-yellow blazers, designed by Pierre Balmain, with a yellow and blue clip-on bowtie. It was horrendous. The idea, if you were working in standard class, was to sell as much produce as possible and 1999 was the Rugby World Cup \u2013 I\u2019ve never seen so many people drink so much alcohol in my life: when Wales were playing France in Paris, the whole train ran out. Once, when we were preparing the train to depart at Gare du Nord, the French crew were very excited because Mick Jagger was on the platform. I thought, that is actually an A-list celebrity, worth a look, so I went out. It was actually Charlie Watts, but I didn\u2019t want to disappoint my colleagues by correcting them. In those days, one of the carriages was dedicated to what was called premium class. The only person who regularly travelled premium was Paul McCartney. His daughter was just starting work for Chlo\u00e9 in Paris. He would always refuse the food and fill out a comments card saying the vegetarian options would be better if it used Linda McCartney food. The job was good fun and very well-paid, for what it was: bilingual coffee serving. I liked chatting in French and it cleared my overdraft. Twice. I kept my banana-yellow blazer for a few years afterwards. Tom Wolfe is now an English literature teacher in Yangon, Myanmar. I got my A-level results on the Eurostar I was going to the south of France on holiday with my boyfriend. For some reason we booked for the day my A-level results were coming out. It was an early train, and as soon as I could ring the school I did. I didn\u2019t want to call in front of everyone, so I went to the little space between the carriages.

      "bodyText": "Not many rugby players have described moving to Manchester as a blessing but Faf de Klerk is a singular scrum-half and not just because he looks half the height and weight of most of South Africa\u2019s pack. He has become one of the players adopted by the Japanese media following the departure of their team from the tournament after losing against the Springboks. No player trod more over the dreams of the host nation than De Klerk, whose kicking, sniping and ability to read Japan\u2019s lines of attack and snuff out moves at their point of origin earned him the award for man of the match, although some in South Africa complained he should have released the ball more, a tactic that got Ireland nowhere in their group match against the hosts. Yet two years ago, De Klerk\u2019s prospects of appearing in this tournament looked no more likely than Jaco Peyper being made honorary president of the French Referees\u2019 Society. De Klerk made his Test debut in the summer of June 2016 in the series against Ireland, the first of 11 caps in a year that turned out to be South Africa\u2019s worst with eight defeats, culminating in a reverse against Wales in Cardiff where he was sent to the sin-bin. Five scrum\u2011halves, none of whom is here, were to be tried by South Africa before De Klerk\u2019s time unexpectedly came again. He left the Lions for Sale in 2017. South Africa then had a rule that overseas players with fewer than 30 caps would not be considered by the Springboks but, such was the immediate impact he made, the stipulation was dropped when Rassie Erasmus took charge at the beginning of last year. \u201cThe main thing for me at Sale was that the role I was given needed me to make a difference to the team,\u201d De Klerk said. \u201cResponsibility came my way in terms of how we wanted to play, whether kicking or running.

I also hope we will be talking about how little we noticed the officials and not how much.</p> \n<p>I\u2019ve had a look at four players that may be the spark to a victory for their respective teams and I\u2019ll start with the pre-tournament and, in my eyes, still the slight favourites to win the World Cup for the third time in succession \u2013 New Zealand and the quite brilliant Beauden Barrett.</p> \n<p>I first came across Beauden when he was playing for the New Zealand sevens team in 2010. He was young and pretty green but balanced, quick and not afraid to try things. Fast forward to last weekend and one moment that was actually a botched one, to me summed up his approach to the game. The All Blacks were on the attack, had a knock-on advantage and Barrett had just slightly overrun the ball. He tried to do a back heel. He missed the ball but it revealed so much more.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Not many would open themselves up to look a bit daft by trying something he knew his skills had a small chance of pulling off. He is brimming with confidence and swagger right now \u2013 as that attacking threat at the back and second receiver at the front, he is unlike anyone else in the tournament. The other three sides have not got a full-back who offers them so much in those areas. If there is one player England need to subdue for the entire match, it\u2019s him.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"407505f1667c33203a90ba7e03908dcdc60c0ebc\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/407505f1667c33203a90ba7e03908dcdc60c0ebc/0_378_3233_4471/723.jpg\" alt=\"Makazole Mapimpi only made his South Africa Test debut last year.\" width=\"723\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Makazole Mapimpi only made his South Africa Test debut last year.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Harry How/World Rugby via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In their quarter-final, hosts Japan finally ran aground against South Africa. Makazole Mapimpi, the Boks\u2019 29-year-old wing from Mdantsane, racked up his 13th try in 12 Test matches. Cheslin Kolbe is normally the headliner but Mapimpi is a deadly finisher. Opportunities will be few against Wales but the chance of him converting even the slimmest of those is high.</p> \n<p>The first member of his family to play rugby, he attended schools that had no history of producing players and worked his way through the levels by scorching through defences and scoring tries. The emphasis in the semi-finals will be scoring points against miserly defences. That\u2019s what Mapimpi does.</p> \n<p>South Africa will have to get the ball to him and players such as Faf de Klerk are going to be pivotal but when you get to this stage it\u2019s high success rates in your kicking and high conversion rates in your attacks that count. That\u2019s his strength. Not 90-metre bursts up field so much but, like a running-back in the NFL, getting those crucial final yards right.</p> \n<p>They will have to get past Justin Tipuric, however, whose bottomless box of tools will give Warren Gatland\u2019s men options in almost every area of the game. You see it not only his high tackle count and work rate in defence that gives his team a vital link in Shaun Edwards\u2019 defensive plans. It\u2019s also Tipuric\u2019s attacking prowess, in which his sevens background is definitely an advantage: he passes brilliantly and has a loping stride that often catches out a defender. He can also pick lines that get him on the edges of players to bust through or pass out of to break a defensive line. At the lineout he has been used a lot as a jumper and that is in attack and in defence.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6fef03be-90e4-4479-a966-6b06ac24f770\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u2022&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/18/rugby-world-cup-2019-fixtures-tables-and-results\">Fixtures, tables and results</a></p>\n    <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/20/top-try-and-points-scorers-for-the-2019-rugby-world-cup-japan\">Top try and points scorers</a></p>\n    <p>\u2022&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/19/rugby-world-cup-2019-stadium-guide\">Stadium guide</a></p>\n    <p>\u2022&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/19/rugby-world-cup-2019-guide-to-the-referees\">Referee guide</a><br></p>\n    <p>\u2022 Our latest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/minutebyminute+sport/rugby-union\">minute-by-minute live reports</a></p>\n    <p>\u2022&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/18/sign-up-to-the-breakdown\">Sign up to The Breakdown</a>, our free rugby union email newsletter</p>\n    <p><b>Team guides</b><br>Pool A: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/09/rugby-world-cup-2019-ireland-team-guide\">Ireland</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/09/rugby-world-cup-2019-japan-team-guide\">Japan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/10/rugby-world-cup-2019-russia-team-guide\">Russia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/10/rugby-world-cup-2019-samoa-team-guide\">Samoa</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/11/rugby-world-cup-2019-scotland-team-guide\">Scotland</a><br>Pool B: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/11/rugby-world-cup-2019-canada-team-guide\">Canada</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/12/rugby-world-cup-2019-italy-team-guide\">Italy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/12/rugby-world-cup-2019-namibia-team-guide\">Namibia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/13/rugby-world-cup-2019-new-zealand-team-guide\">New Zealand</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/13/rugby-world-cup-2019-south-africa-team-guide\">South Africa</a><br>Pool C: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/14/rugby-world-cup-2019-argentina-team-guide\">Argentina</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/14/rugby-world-cup-2019-england-team-guide\">England</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/15/rugby-world-cup-2019-france-team-guide\">France</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/16/rugby-world-cup-2019-tonga-team-guide\">Tonga</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/15/rugby-world-cup-2019-usa-team-guide\">USA</a><br>Pool D: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/17/rugby-world-cup-2019-australia-team-guide\">Australia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/18/rugby-world-cup-2019-fiji-team-guide\">Fiji</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/17/rugby-world-cup-2019-georgia-team-guide\">Georgia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/18/rugby-world-cup-2019-uruguay-team-guide\">Uruguay</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/16/rugby-world-cup-2019-wales-team-guide\">Wales</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>If he was in your fantasy football team he would be Trent Alexander-Arnold, Kevin De Bruyne and Tammy Abraham wrapped up into one.

      "bodyText": "It can all be cart before the horse in the days preceding such big games as we await the World Cup semi-finals in Japan. Coaches take to front and centre \u2013 some by choice, others by the path of convention and process. Perhaps it\u2019s mindgames to distract their opponents or perhaps to allow players the shelter before the show. However, if those coaches have got their planning and peaking right then they will slowly step back into the shadows and it will be their players that step into the limelight. I think we all want the two semi-finals to be decided by moments of brilliance and not crass stupidity as shown by S\u00e9bastien Vahaamahina for France in the quarter finals. I also hope we will be talking about how little we noticed the officials and not how much. I\u2019ve had a look at four players that may be the spark to a victory for their respective teams and I\u2019ll start with the pre-tournament and, in my eyes, still the slight favourites to win the World Cup for the third time in succession \u2013 New Zealand and the quite brilliant Beauden Barrett. I first came across Beauden when he was playing for the New Zealand sevens team in 2010. He was young and pretty green but balanced, quick and not afraid to try things. Fast forward to last weekend and one moment that was actually a botched one, to me summed up his approach to the game. The All Blacks were on the attack, had a knock-on advantage and Barrett had just slightly overrun the ball. He tried to do a back heel. He missed the ball but it revealed so much more. Not many would open themselves up to look a bit daft by trying something he knew his skills had a small chance of pulling off. He is brimming with confidence and swagger right now \u2013 as that attacking threat at the back and second receiver at the front, he is unlike anyone else in the tournament. The other three sides have not got a full-back who offers them so much in those areas. If there is one player England need to subdue for the entire match, it\u2019s him. In their quarter-final, hosts Japan finally ran aground against South Africa. Makazole Mapimpi, the Boks\u2019 29-year-old wing from Mdantsane, racked up his 13th try in 12 Test matches. Cheslin Kolbe is normally the headliner but Mapimpi is a deadly finisher. Opportunities will be few against Wales but the chance of him converting even the slimmest of those is high. The first member of his family to play rugby, he attended schools that had no history of producing players and worked his way through the levels by scorching through defences and scoring tries. The emphasis in the semi-finals will be scoring points against miserly defences. That\u2019s what Mapimpi does. South Africa will have to get the ball to him and players such as Faf de Klerk are going to be pivotal but when you get to this stage it\u2019s high success rates in your kicking and high conversion rates in your attacks that count. That\u2019s his strength. Not 90-metre bursts up field so much but, like a running-back in the NFL, getting those crucial final yards right. They will have to get past Justin Tipuric, however, whose bottomless box of tools will give Warren Gatland\u2019s men options in almost every area of the game. You see it not only his high tackle count and work rate in defence that gives his team a vital link in Shaun Edwards\u2019 defensive plans. It\u2019s also Tipuric\u2019s attacking prowess, in which his sevens background is definitely an advantage: he passes brilliantly and has a loping stride that often catches out a defender. He can also pick lines that get him on the edges of players to bust through or pass out of to break a defensive line. At the lineout he has been used a lot as a jumper and that is in attack and in defence. If he was in your fantasy football team he would be Trent Alexander-Arnold, Kevin De Bruyne and Tammy Abraham wrapped up into one. Priceless to hopes of Wales winning the World Cup. Finally it\u2019s Owen Farrell. This is the most important game he has ever played in. Without him, England will not win the World Cup.

      "body": "<p>My husband, Mark Kinghorn, who has died of cancer aged 58, spent his career working with people with learning difficulties and mental health issues. He constantly challenged the injustices that many of them faced, particularly those living in London and Edinburgh.</p> <p>He was brought up near Hawick, on the Scottish borders, where he was from a long line of shepherds whose housing and livelihoods had always depended on the whims of the land-owning aristocracy.</p> <p>Mark\u2019s family had to move home many times and he attended several primary schools. Those experiences shaped him first in a fierce desire not to perpetuate the pattern, then in an appreciation of the history and politics that underlay them. Over time he turned a deep anger into a dedication to socialist politics.</p> <p>Mark was born in Jedburgh, one of four children of Rea, a shepherd in Hawick, and Bett, who kept the home farm. When he left Hawick, in 1979, he spent a year as an unlikely business studies student in Edinburgh and then went to Thames Polytechnic (now the University of Greenwich) in London, where he could embrace literature, history and politics. He was active during the miners\u2019 and print workers\u2019 strikes and was a union steward for Unison for 35 years.</p> <p>In London he was also able to live his life in music, which culminated with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yl2-DyLVR7w\" title=\"\">singing</a> in a group formed with some college friends, the Love Act. Nearly 30 years later he was both surprised and delighted to see the band, along with a picture of him wearing a pearly king jacket, featured in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jun/11/jangle-unchained-in-defence-of-c86-nme\" title=\"\">a Guardian article</a> that appeared to somehow link them to the birth of indie music.</p> <p>Mark and I met in London in the mid-1980s, in the early days of the Care in the Community programme, when we both worked in one of the first re-provisioning teams closing a long-stay hospital. None of us really knew what we were doing, but Mark had a natural ability to take vulnerable people as they came, to listen and to support them in making decisions that would help them leave behind the years of incarceration and build new lives. We married in 1987 and Mark threw himself into family life; he adored being a father.</p> <p>We moved to Edinburgh, where he completed his master\u2019s degree in social work, became a social worker and then a mental health officer, transforming his natural empathy and ability into a discerning and thoughtful professionalism.</p> <p>His life was filled with family, friendships and his great passions \u2013 politics, music and cricket. Over the years he never really changed, he just grew into himself and had the loveliest way of living, enjoying every encounter.</p> <p>After one such chance meeting on the street during an Edinburgh festival, the poet laureate Carol Ann Duffy sent him a poem that was later read at his funeral.</p> <p>He never let life diminish him, even during the most challenging of recent times and truly believed that with compassion, friendship, communication and organisation, anything from personal challenge to political injustice could and would be overcome.</p> <p>Mark is survived by me, our children, Alice and Joe, his mother, brother, William, and sister, Jane. His other brother, Alan, predeceased him.</p>",

      "bodyText": "My husband, Mark Kinghorn, who has died of cancer aged 58, spent his career working with people with learning difficulties and mental health issues. He constantly challenged the injustices that many of them faced, particularly those living in London and Edinburgh. He was brought up near Hawick, on the Scottish borders, where he was from a long line of shepherds whose housing and livelihoods had always depended on the whims of the land-owning aristocracy. Mark\u2019s family had to move home many times and he attended several primary schools. Those experiences shaped him first in a fierce desire not to perpetuate the pattern, then in an appreciation of the history and politics that underlay them. Over time he turned a deep anger into a dedication to socialist politics. Mark was born in Jedburgh, one of four children of Rea, a shepherd in Hawick, and Bett, who kept the home farm. When he left Hawick, in 1979, he spent a year as an unlikely business studies student in Edinburgh and then went to Thames Polytechnic (now the University of Greenwich) in London, where he could embrace literature, history and politics. He was active during the miners\u2019 and print workers\u2019 strikes and was a union steward for Unison for 35 years. In London he was also able to live his life in music, which culminated with singing in a group formed with some college friends, the Love Act. Nearly 30 years later he was both surprised and delighted to see the band, along with a picture of him wearing a pearly king jacket, featured in a Guardian article that appeared to somehow link them to the birth of indie music. Mark and I met in London in the mid-1980s, in the early days of the Care in the Community programme, when we both worked in one of the first re-provisioning teams closing a long-stay hospital. None of us really knew what we were doing, but Mark had a natural ability to take vulnerable people as they came, to listen and to support them in making decisions that would help them leave behind the years of incarceration and build new lives. We married in 1987 and Mark threw himself into family life; he adored being a father. We moved to Edinburgh, where he completed his master\u2019s degree in social work, became a social worker and then a mental health officer, transforming his natural empathy and ability into a discerning and thoughtful professionalism. His life was filled with family, friendships and his great passions \u2013 politics, music and cricket. Over the years he never really changed, he just grew into himself and had the loveliest way of living, enjoying every encounter. After one such chance meeting on the street during an Edinburgh festival, the poet laureate Carol Ann Duffy sent him a poem that was later read at his funeral. He never let life diminish him, even during the most challenging of recent times and truly believed that with compassion, friendship, communication and organisation, anything from personal challenge to political injustice could and would be overcome. Mark is survived by me, our children, Alice and Joe, his mother, brother, William, and sister, Jane. His other brother, Alan, predeceased him.",

The private equity firm pledged to invest \u00a3400m and within months it was boasting of a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/01/scunthorpe-steelworkers-enjoy-happy-outcome-to-act-of-faith\">return to profit and a bright future ahead</a>. Three years later it collapsed. In a letter to staff, the British Steel chief executive blamed weak market demand, high raw material prices, the weakness of sterling and uncertainty over the outcome of Brexit discussions.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How much is Brexit to blame?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>It is not the only factor in the crisis but it is very important. Steel contracts are typically agreed well in advance of the product being delivered. As things stand, the UK is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/11/may-agrees-to-october-brexit-after-franco-german-carve-up\">due to leave the EU on 31 October</a>&nbsp;and the terms of that separation are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/21/may-offers-mps-vote-on-second-referendum-in-new-brexit-deal\">yet to be agreed</a>, meaning British Steel\u2019s overseas customers do not know what tariffs will apply to steel they buy from the company. Sources close to the company said orders from customers in the EU and further afield have dried up as a result.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Can the company survive in some form?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>While many of the fundamental problems affecting it remain, the prospective new owners, the Turkish military pension fund Oyak, appear committed to investing in expanding production and preserving large numbers of jobs \u2013 a key priority for the government.

      "bodyText": "The proposed takeover of British Steel by Turkey\u2019s military pension fund is in danger of collapse, after the government said it was preparing to open discussions with rival bidders. Ataer Holdings, a division of Turkish army pension fund Oyak, has been in exclusive talks with the official receiver, the government official overseeing a sale it was hoped could save more than 4,500 jobs and the Scunthorpe steelworks, which makes 96% of all the UK\u2019s railway tracks. But a 10-week exclusivity period ends on Thursday, amid reports that Ataer\u2019s interest has stalled because of difficulties in convincing British Steel\u2019s suppliers to accept lower prices for goods and services. \u201cWhile discussions with Ataer are continuing, discussions with other parties who have expressed continued and renewed interest in acquiring the whole British Steel business will now be possible,\u201d said David Chapman, the official receiver. \u201cI have instructed the special managers [the accountancy firm EY] to engage with these additional interested parties. \u201cDiligence team members from these parties are expected to visit the company\u2019s sites over the coming days and weeks. Meanwhile, Ataer remain very much interested in acquiring the business and we remain in detailed discussions with them to conclude a sale.\u201d Liberty House, which is run by the steel magnate Sanjeev Gupta, is expected to rekindle its interest, while the Chinese firm Jingye is also thought to be waiting in the wings. The Guardian approached Ataer for comment, but had received no response at the time of publication. The shadow steel minister, Gill Furniss, said: \u201cThe Tories continue to treat our steel sector with contempt and their inaction is having a real impact on the lives of workers and their families. \u201cFive thousand direct jobs and many more in the supply chain depend on a deal going through. The government must do everything it can to ensure a responsible and credible buyer is found to secure the future of these important steelworks.\u201d She said Labour would \u201ccreate a level playing field\u201d for UK steel firms by bringing down energy prices, investing in technology and preventing foreign firms from dumping cheap steel on the market. Oyak\u2019s suitability as a buyer for British Steel has been called into question in recent weeks after trade union officials and MPs said they were concerned about its connections to the army and the government of Turkey because of its incursion into northern Syria. The Guardian has previously revealed that Oyak was accused of corruption by a parliamentary inquiry in Turkey and that it planned to move a chemicals firm it owns out of the UK, at the cost of dozens of jobs. The collapse of British Steel this year threatened the future of the Scunthorpe site, one of the last two blast furnace steelworks in the UK. The government is understood to have offered buyers of British Steel grants, indemnities and loans worth \u00a3300m to support a deal that can save the site. The Insolvency Service is funding the company\u2019s operations in the meantime. This has increased pressure on finding a buyer because of the mounting cost to taxpayers. \u201cI remain focused on achieving a sale of the business and assets of British Steel as quickly as possible, to achieve the best possible outcome for the company\u2019s creditors,\u201d said Chapman. \u201cThe conclusion of the exclusivity period allows us to consider all of the options available at this point in the process.

The shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon, reiterated on Wednesday that Labour\u2019s policy is to back an election if the party can guarantee it will not be bounced into a no-deal scenario.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson is expected to push for a general election if the EU agrees to a three-month delay to Brexit until 31 January. He has three options: A motion for a general election Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, an election may be called if it is agreed by two-thirds of the total number of MPs. When Theresa May held one of these votes before the snap 2017 election, 522 MPs to 18 voted in favour of returning to the polls earlier than 2020. Boris Johnson presented motions for an election on 4 and 9 September and failed on both occasions when the majority of Labour MPs abstained. Jeremy Corbyn said he would only back an election once the threat of a no-deal Brexit had been taken off the table. Johnson could try this again and potentially secure Labour backing, because the Benn act has removed the imminent possibility of a no-deal Brexit. The shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon, reiterated on Wednesday that Labour\u2019s policy is to back an election if the party can guarantee it will not be bounced into a no-deal scenario. However, Labour may feel the threat has not truly been removed and may need further reassurances. It is seen as the favoured option because it is unamendable and gives a fixed election date. A one-line bill This lowers the threshold of MPs needed to trigger a general election because it requires a simple majority to pass. This could work in Johnson\u2019s favour. However, it is amendable, which can involve the moving of an election date to a time that works for the opposition. The former Conservative Ken Clarke said such a bill could also be amended to lower the voting age to 16, and there could be other surprise changes thrown in by opposition parties. Johnson has so far resisted this, as it is seen as giving him less power over the process and, with no majority, amendments would be likely to pass.

Therefore their staunch opposition was about power politics, and so their \u201ccapitulation\u201d to Johnson\u2019s deal is nothing of the sort. This is a group getting used to their victory.

Contrary to popular belief, the Tories have never been the party of business as a whole. Throughout its history they have, as a rule, tended to represent and organise only certain sectors and types of business. Since the inception of the modern Conservative party in the 1830s, financial interests \u2013 the City, banks, owners of large property portfolios, overseas speculators and the like \u2013 have tended to trump those of industry. For instance, while Thatcher framed her programme in terms of reversing national decline, she catered for finance with tax cuts, deregulation, and privatisation; the labour movement was brought to heel and manufacturing collapsed, taking whole sections of British capital along with it. Nevertheless, finance itself is no monolith, and can be variously divided by the sectors it chooses to invest in, the extent it engages in directly speculative activity, and whether it tends to look toward Britain, Europe, or the rest of the world for its returns. These orientations offer a useful way of reading Tory divisions on the EU.</p> <p>On the one hand you might expect to find finance that is more interested in domestic property or markets outside the EU less disposed to the bloc\u2019s regulatory \u201cinterference\u201d than for those whom it is a normal part of doing business inside the EU. After all, different businesses have different markets, located in different places. Forty-plus years of economic integration with the UK\u2019s closest neighbours has produced a wing of finance capital for whom EU-based investments is the route to profit, and are therefore happy to comply with EU regulations. Meanwhile Eurosceptic finance would find ready allies in industries that would benefit from the eradication of those regulations, such as agriculture and labour-intensive sectors for whom holding down wages is always a priority. The ERG and the external Tory party organised by Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party are representatives of this coalition. Some of these concerns are shared by EU-oriented capital, which is why they cohabited happily under David Cameron, but once the dam burst during the referendum, the prospect of restricted access to EU markets became real, and the relations between EU and overseas-oriented finance more antagonistic.</p> <p>Therefore the goal the ERG seeks \u2013 of a deregulated and effectively deindustrialised UK \u2013 looks completely irrational from the perspective of the health of British capitalism as a whole. The EU remains the UK\u2019s largest export market, as well as the largest provider of imports. For most sections of business, new barriers to these flows of goods and capital will hit earnings and therefore profits. This is less the case in terms of the ERG\u2019s sectional interests. They are prepared and happy to sacrifice the general business interest for their narrower concerns. A deskilled, low-wage workforce with few rights, and the UK a playground for footloose corporations to shake their tail at the EU\u2019s regulatory regime from 21 miles across the Channel, would suit them perfectly. Therefore when you look at the kind of businesses associated with or owned by ERG notables, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/22/jacob-rees-mogg-second-irish-fund-scm\" title=\"\">Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s emerging markets fund</a> or Steve Baker\u2019s financial services holdings, it suggests their penchant for transforming the country into a no-regulation tax haven may align with their interests.

Like a fatberg blocking the sewers of Capitol Hill, Trump\u2019s sense of victimhood and love of lying is creating unbearable pressure in a system designed to flush away an extraordinary volume of political waste material. So Republicans were talking about Trump\u2019s self-styled lynching instead of defending Trump from the blockbuster impeachment evidence of his current ambassador to Ukraine. Until now, Trump has drawn what he might call a \u201cred line in the sand\u201d around the notion that there was no quid pro quo in Ukraine \u2013 no withholding of military aid in exchange for political dirt on the Biden family. But ambassador William Taylor flatly contradicted Trump\u2019s defence, much like his chief of staff Mick Mulvaney did last week \u2013 before Mulvaney was forced to swallow his words and regurgitate them back into the public square in an unspeakable puddle. Never mind all that quidding and quoing now. It\u2019s time to run for the vomitorium. How did the party that gave the world freedom fries find itself locked in this Trump-shaped prison? The simple answer is that they built it themselves. Trump didn\u2019t invent it; he\u2019s not nearly enough of a very stable genius. In the days after the 9/11 attacks, Republicans looked at the world and decided to see its enemies: an amorphous group of freedom-haters. Only Republicans could protect America from such global threats. But in the absence of a torrent of al-Qaida insurgents at America\u2019s borders, the party rapidly switched to protecting America from Latinos. Once you unleash the politics of fear, you create the space for your own fear-peddling president. Where you once pretended to be strong on terrorism, you now follow a president who just conspired with Turkey and Russia to revive Isis from near-death in Syria. Where you once claimed Obamacare was an abuse of the constitution, you now support a president who claims that some part of the same founding document is phony. Where you once claimed to defend freedom, you no longer have the freedom to speak your mind or your values. Unless you call yourself Pierre and join the cheese-eating surrender monkeys on Twitter. Until now, Trump has assumed he can get away with murder because Republican senators will acquit him in an impeachment trial. That may be a reasonable assumption, even for someone as smart as Trump.

Smuggled was due to have its first screening on Monday and was billed by the broadcaster as the largest test of the UK\u2019s borders ever conducted by the media. Promotional material for the two-part series said it would follow eight British citizens as they attempted to enter Britain from a variety of locations around continental Europe. It asked: \u201cWithout using their passport, evading Border Force authorities altogether, how many of them will make it undetected?\u201d Channel 4 said it had commissioned the show, made by ScreenDog Productions, at a time when the UK was preparing to \u201ctake back control\u201d through Brexit and border security had become a major political concern. The promotional material added: \u201cFrom boats to lorries, ferries to car boots, all of the contributors attempt routes that have been used by those seeking to enter the country clandestinely or by people traffickers and drug dealers.\u201d Alf Lawrie, the head of factual entertainment at Channel 4, said in August: \u201cThis dramatic series has real purpose at its heart.

MEPs blocked revised legislation that was said to ignore the risk to bee larvae from long-term exposure to chemicals, known as chronic toxicity. The MEPs instead argued a guidance document (pdf) produced by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in 2013 should be fully implemented. The guidance seeks both to protect bees from adverse effects from a single exposure or multiple exposures over a short period of time, known as acute toxicity, and also long-term exposure. Sixteen member states, which have not been publicly named, lobbied against the full implementation of the guidance before the new rules are brought to a vote in the European parliament. Green MEPs who led the way on the parliamentary veto claimed the new generation of systemic pesticides, which are applied via seed treatment rather than spraying, made chronic exposure particularly relevant. Bee populations have collapsed around the world and the use of pesticides is said to be the main cause. A 2019 analysis of 353 wild bee and hoverfly species in the UK found the insects have been lost from a quarter of the places in which they were found in 1980.

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s anti-corruption agency has applied for an employment tribunal, brought against it by one of its former senior employees, to be held in secret. The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) is being sued for unfair dismissal by Tom Martin, a former prosecutor responsible for leading corruption investigations. He was sacked last year for gross misconduct, after allegedly swearing at an FBI agent in a pub. The SFO confirmed it had asked for a hearing of the employment tribunal, which is scheduled for December, to be held behind closed doors. It has asked for reporters to be barred from attending the hearing. Martin led the agency\u2019s investigation into allegations that Unaoil, a Monaco-based oil and gas consultancy, paid large bribes to secure contracts in the energy industry around the world. The investigation, one of the largest being run by the SFO, was launched in March 2016 following reports by investigative reporters working for the Australian newspaper the Age. The inquiry has involved extensive collaboration with prosecutors in the USA, including the FBI and the Department of Justice. Martin was dismissed last December after the agency decided he had sworn at an FBI agent and called him a \u201cquisling\u201d and a spy, according to a document outlining his claim before the employment tribunal. The incident is alleged to have happened in May 2016 after British and American prosecutors working on the investigation went to a London pub after a meeting. Martin is alleging that relations, particularly with the American prosecutors, were at times considerably strained, according to the document. He is arguing that strong language among law enforcement was commonplace and would not constitute gross misconduct.

There seems to have been a hangover into 2019, with customers calculating that waiting to book is a productive strategy.</p>\n    <p><b>Competition</b><br>A pincer movement of Airbnb and budget holidays has changed consumer behaviour, though Thomas Cook still managed to sell 11m package holidays last year.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Banks and debt</b><br>The tour operator has been attempting to shoulder a&nbsp; huge pile of debt for the past decade \u2013 \u00a31.7bn worth at the last count. Successive managements failed to remove meaningful chunks. The banks argue they have supported an overstretched company for years and the details of why it could not be saved may have to await the report from the Insolvency Service.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Bad management</b><br>Thomas Cook\u2019s borrowings were too high.

Tell me more Bill Taylor, a career diplomat and former ambassador to Ukraine, ignored a White House gag order to testify before Congress for almost 10 hours. Taylor testified that Trump\u2019s White House sought a quid pro quo with Ukraine involving US military aid in exchange for a public announcement by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, that he was investigating a company tied to former vice-president Joe Biden.

The results from Eurobarometer, the EU\u2019s polling organisation, also found that almost 90% of people thought helping people in developing countries should be a priority of the EU and national governments. Romilly Greenhill, UK director of the advocacy group the One Campaign, said it was \u201cheartening\u201d that the vast majority of British people believe that helping people in developing countries is the right thing to do. \u201cDespite the gloomy picture often painted, British people support building a more peaceful, progressive and prosperous world for all,\u201d she said. Greenhill was encouraged by the finding that showed almost two-thirds of the British public think tackling poverty in developing countries should be \u201ca major priority\u201d for the UK government. \u201cWhile Britain\u2019s relationship with the world is changing, this shows we are still an outward looking country,\u201d Greenhill said. The annual poll, which was conducted face to face in June 2019 among 26,464 Europeans, canvassed views on migration, the private sector and gender. It also asked what people thought should be the role of national governments and the EU in development. Claire Godfrey, interim director of policy, advocacy and research at Bond, the British network for organisations working in international development, said the survey was \u201cincredibly timely\u201d as the UK government begins to redefine its role in a post-Brexit world. British respondents were among the most positive about helping people in developing countries, but more sceptical than last year about development as a means to tackle migration. In line with the EU average, British citizens think that the EU should strengthen its partnership with African countries and increase financial investment in the continent. \u201cPoliticians in Westminster should heed this news,\u201d said Greenhill. \u201cWhatever the problems they grapple with today, British people are focusing on tomorrow, and believe that helping people in developing countries contributes to a more peaceful and fairer world.\u201d Across the 28 member countries, the poll revealed broad consensus among European citizens on the significance of cross-border cooperation and development. Just as in the UK, almost 90% of EU citizens said that it is important to support people in developing countries, confirming a trend established over recent years. Development emerged as one of the most positively perceived EU policies. The European commissioner for International Cooperation and Development, Neven Mimica, said he was \u201cvery happy\u201d to see that Europeans continue their \u201cstrong support\u201d for development and key priorities like \u201cstrengthening partnerships with Africa; deepening our engagement to create jobs; and bringing in more private investments\u201d. Mimica said this support was a \u201csolid basis for the union to maintain its leading global role and address the significant challenges that remain\u201d. Bond has been working with its members on continuity in funding and service following Brexit. Godfrey said it was reassuring to see that, \u201cdespite the loud voices shouting down the importance and public support behind UK aid, in fact seven out of 10 people think our aid contribution doesn\u2019t need changing or even should be increased, while over 60% of those interviewed think tackling poverty in developing countries should be a main priority of government\u201d. The British public understood that \u201cfairer trade, tax, ethical investments, transparency and tackling climate change are good for reducing poverty, inequality and combating environmental harm,\u201d she said. Looking ahead, Godfrey said: \u201cThe government, and any future government, should take note of these results when thinking about what our development and aid priorities should be following Brexit.\u201d In 2013, the UK joined the leading group of donors that have met the UN-target of spending 0.7% of gross national income on aid, laid down in 1970. Despite backbench opposition, this commitment was then enshrined in law in 2015. This year\u2019s survey follows closer scrutiny of the rules that mean refugee costs can formally be counted as \u201cofficial development assistance\u201d \u2013 the convention agreed by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development for what is eligible as part of 0.7% commitment. Funding for detention centres, border security and patrols, and the costs of returning failed asylum-seekers are now clearly excluded.

This is the bit where democracies are so evolved and self\u2011assured they sell their freedom of speech to totalitarian regimes. I know! But kind of logical, when you think about it. There was basically nothing left to flog. For those who\u2019ve missed the saga of the NBA\u2019s travails in China, have no fear. It isn\u2019t going away any time soon, with last weekend\u2019s development being groups of fans wearing masks and \u201cStand With Hong Kong\u201d T-shirts standing in protest at the Brooklyn Nets preseason finale at the Barclays Center, in a show of support unlikely to be looked on fondly by the People\u2019s Republic. Tuesday night\u2019s opening NBA games were duly blacked out by China\u2019s state broadcaster. First, though, a recap of the story: earlier this month, the Houston Rockets general manager, Daryl Morey, tweeted his support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. In fairly short order, the Rockets stated that his views did not reflect those of the team, while the NBA informed the world it was \u201cregrettable\u201d Morey\u2019s tweet had caused offence. You know you\u2019re in dangerous territory when you\u2019re reduced to nodding along with Ted Cruz, but the Texas senator declared: \u201cWe\u2019re better than this; human rights shouldn\u2019t be for sale and the NBA shouldn\u2019t be assisting Chinese communist censorship.\u201d Suggesting there may yet be one bipartisan issue left in the US, the Democratic hopeful Beto O\u2019Rourke was soon voicing similar sentiments. Alas, none of these were really what the Chinese government wanted to hear, leading to the state threatening to cut ties with the NBA. Some Chinese companies have pulled sponsorship. Slightly changing tack, the NBA mounted a grimly mealy-mouthed defence of Morey, with the NBA commissioner, Adam Silver, explaining: \u201cI understand there are consequences from his freedom of speech and we will have to live with those consequences.\u201d Over to Chinese state television. \u201cWe\u2019re strongly dissatisfied and oppose Adam Silver\u2019s claim to support Morey\u2019s right to freedom of expression,\u201d CCTV said in a statement. \u201cWe believe any remarks that challenge national sovereignty and social stability are not within the scope of freedom of speech.\u201d As for who should give a toss what they believe, unless you\u2019re Chinese and have no choice \u2026 enter LeBron James. Given what a powerful voice the Lakers star has been for civil rights in the US, there was a certain amount of disappointment that he opted to say of Morey: \u201cI believe he wasn\u2019t educated about the situation at hand and he spoke.

They accused the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) of drawing a false equivalence between what it described as racial harassment against white British students and staff and the racism suffered by their black and minority ethnic peers. According to the watchdog\u2019s student survey, 9% of white British students experienced racial harassment, compared with 29% of black students and 27% of Asian students. The report, Tackling Racial Harassment: Universities Challenged, highlighted examples of anti-English sentiment at Scottish and Welsh universities. A white English member of staff told the inquiry that two Welsh colleagues used a slur when referring to English people: \u201cShe was speaking in English and changed to Welsh for that word thinking I wouldn\u2019t understand.

He had served as ambassador there before, between 2006-2009. Taylor said he had reservations about taking up the role because his predecessor, Marie Yovanovitch, had been \u201cpoorly treated\u201d and caught up \u201cin a web of political machinations both in Kyiv and Washington\u201d. Taylor said he agreed on condition the US\u2019s policy of strong military and political support for Ukraine continued, at a time when it was under Russian attack. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, confirmed this. Taylor arrived in Kyiv in June. He took with him a letter from Trump inviting Ukraine\u2019s new president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/volodymyr-zelenskiy\">Zelenskiy</a> to the White House.</p> <h2><strong>What did he find</strong><strong> when he arrived?</strong></h2> <p>Two foreign policies. In Kyiv, Taylor said he found a \u201cconfusing\u201d and \u201cultimately alarming\u201d situation. On the plus side, the new Zelenskiy government did appear to be making progress in tackling the country\u2019s corruption. But Taylor said he discovered two distinct channels of \u201cUS policymaking\u201d. One was regular. It included diplomatic support for reform. The other was \u201chighly irregular\u201d and run by some of Trump\u2019s closest aides. They included special envoy Kurt Volker; the EU ambassador, Gordon Sondland; and the energy secretary, Rick Perry. Taylor said he later learned Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani was involved. In late June Taylor said he \u201csensed something odd\u201d about a planned call with Zelenskiy. Sondland told him that \u201cregular interagency participants\u201d would be excluded. And that he would pass on a demand from Trump to \u201cget to the bottom of things\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>What did that mean?</strong></h2> <p>Taylor said in mid-July it was clear that Trump wanted Zelenskiy to \u201cinvestigate\u201d two things. One was the conspiracy theory that Ukraine colluded with Hillary Clinton in 2016 to help her win the presidential election. The other was Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company where Hunter Biden \u2013 son of Joe Biden \u2013 had served on the board. The allegation, subsequently found to be untrue, was that Joe Biden had put pressure on the previous government of Petro Poroshenko to fire the prosecutor investigating Burisma, in order to help his son. Taylor said Giuliani was behind the \u201cirregular policy channel\u201d and that Trump would only meet with Zelenskiy if the Ukrainian president carried out these investigations. There was an explicit quid pro quo, Taylor suggested.</p> <h2><strong>What happened next?</strong></h2> <p>The White House put on hold almost $400m of military assistance promised to Ukraine. Taylor said he was astonished to learn of this, during a July conference call. The secretaries of defense and state, the CIA director and national security adviser all tried to get this overturned \u2013 without success. Taylor told Washington that Ukrainians in the east of the country would die without the assistance. Meanwhile, senior figures were furious that Trump was insisting on \u201cinvestigations\u201d before a meeting with Zelenskiy could take place. John Bolton called this \u201ca drug deal\u201d and told Fiona Hill, Trump\u2019s senior Russia expert, to \u201cbrief the lawyers\u201d. Taylor began keeping notes. Understandably, the Ukrainians were \u201cconfused\u201d about US policy, he said.</p> <h2><strong>Was there a phone call?</strong></h2> <p>The notorious phone call between Trump and Zelenskiy took place on 25 July. Before the call, Sondland reportedly told Zelenskiy to tell Trump he would \u201cleave no stone unturned\u201d in investigating Biden. Taylor said he wasn\u2019t given a readout of the conversation, which was \u201cstrange\u201d. The ambassador became increasingly concerned by the lack of military aid to Ukraine. He asked Tim Morrison, Hill\u2019s replacement on the National Security Council, about this and was told bluntly: \u201cThe president doesn\u2019t want to provide any assistance at all.\u201d Taylor said he wrote a cable to Pompeo setting out his concerns and saying it would be \u201cfolly\u201d to deny the Ukrainians help when they were under attack.</p> <h2><strong>What about CNN?</strong></h2> <p>According to Taylor, Trump insisted that Zelenskiy make a public statement before he would meet with him. The Ukrainian president should appear on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/cnn\">CNN</a> and announce that he was opening an investigation into Biden and Ukraine\u2019s 2016 election interference. Trump \u2013 according to Taylor \u2013 said that Zelenskiy had to \u201cclear things up\u201d and if he didn\u2019t there would be \u201cstalemate\u201d. Taylor took that to mean no American weapons would be delivered. Zelenskiy was on the brink of caving in to Trump\u2019s request but wanted the White House to announce a Trump-Zelenskiy meeting first. This sequence didn\u2019t happen and so Zelenskiy didn\u2019t appear on CNN, to Taylor\u2019s great relief. The ambassador finally learned about the contents of the Zelenskiy-Trump phone call on 25 September, when the White House declassified it. The Ukrainians were \u201clivid\u201d, he said.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Taking off the steamer lid and tearing into these soft and fluffy buns is a joyful moment. To simplify these, don\u2019t add the panda faces, and don\u2019t fill the buns. You can also change the filling, although it\u2019s best not to use anything too watery. Try chocolate or a thick creme pat.</p> <p><em>Makes: 12-14</em></p> <p><em><strong>Ingredients:</strong></em><br><strong>300g plain flour</strong><br><strong>3g fast-action instant yeast</strong><br><strong>60g caster sugar</strong><br><strong>90g tepid whole milk (will work with plant-based milk, too, to make it vegan)</strong><br><strong>80g tepid water</strong><br><strong>1 tbsp vegetable oil</strong></p> <p><em><strong>Plus:</strong></em><br><strong>Black gel food dye</strong><br><strong>100g red bean paste</strong><br><strong>Extra water and plain flour</strong></p> <p>Put the flour, yeast and sugar in a large bowl (or stand mixer, if using). Stir together. Add the milk, water and vegetable oil.</p> <p>If using a stand mixer, knead the bread with the dough hook attachment until smooth and elastic. If working by hand, use a spoon to stir the dough into a rough mass, then turn out on to a floured surface and knead by hand until smooth and elastic.</p> <p>Tear off a small piece of dough (about 30-40g) and knead in black gel food dye, until the colour is well distributed. Place the doughs into separate oiled bowls, and cover with cling film. Leave for about an hour, or until about 50% increased in size.</p> <p>Divide the plain dough into 12 38-40g pieces. To shape the bao, use your fingers to press a piece of dough into a small circle (thinner at the edges than the centre). Then spoon a teaspoon of red bean paste into the centre. Gather the edges upwards and press together to seal in the filling. Turn the bao smooth side up. Try to make sure the surface is as smooth as possible. It helps to rotate the bao while pressing the palms of your hands together, to ensure it is nice and tall to start with (as it will spread sideways when steamed). Brush the bao with a little water, then attach small pieces of black dough to create the panda\u2019s face. Ensure the ears are stuck on well by squeezing firmly to attach them to the white dough.

      "bodyText": "Taking off the steamer lid and tearing into these soft and fluffy buns is a joyful moment. To simplify these, don\u2019t add the panda faces, and don\u2019t fill the buns. You can also change the filling, although it\u2019s best not to use anything too watery. Try chocolate or a thick creme pat. Makes: 12-14 Ingredients: 300g plain flour 3g fast-action instant yeast 60g caster sugar 90g tepid whole milk (will work with plant-based milk, too, to make it vegan) 80g tepid water 1 tbsp vegetable oil Plus: Black gel food dye 100g red bean paste Extra water and plain flour Put the flour, yeast and sugar in a large bowl (or stand mixer, if using). Stir together. Add the milk, water and vegetable oil. If using a stand mixer, knead the bread with the dough hook attachment until smooth and elastic. If working by hand, use a spoon to stir the dough into a rough mass, then turn out on to a floured surface and knead by hand until smooth and elastic. Tear off a small piece of dough (about 30-40g) and knead in black gel food dye, until the colour is well distributed. Place the doughs into separate oiled bowls, and cover with cling film. Leave for about an hour, or until about 50% increased in size. Divide the plain dough into 12 38-40g pieces. To shape the bao, use your fingers to press a piece of dough into a small circle (thinner at the edges than the centre). Then spoon a teaspoon of red bean paste into the centre. Gather the edges upwards and press together to seal in the filling. Turn the bao smooth side up. Try to make sure the surface is as smooth as possible. It helps to rotate the bao while pressing the palms of your hands together, to ensure it is nice and tall to start with (as it will spread sideways when steamed). Brush the bao with a little water, then attach small pieces of black dough to create the panda\u2019s face. Ensure the ears are stuck on well by squeezing firmly to attach them to the white dough. Place the finished bao on a small square of baking paper, and place in a bamboo steamer. Cover lightly with cling film or the steamer lid. Repeat, but don\u2019t overcrowd the buns in the steamer, as they need space to rise. Leave the bao to rise for about 30 mins (it may be much quicker or longer, depending on the room temperature), until about 50% bigger than their original size. Heat a pan of water until just starting to bubble, then turn down to the lowest heat setting and place your bamboo steamer on top of the pan (ideally, the steamer will fit on top without a gap). Wrap the lid in a tea towel, then fit over the base (this soaks up any steam, preventing it dripping on to the bao). Don\u2019t open the lid while steaming.

      "body": "<p>Last month at the New York art book fair, three people approached Paul Graham independently to tell him how moved they were <a href=\"https://mackbooks.co.uk/products/mother-br-paul-graham\">by his new book, Mother</a>. \u201cThey essentially said the same thing, that it struck a deep chord with them,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s my most personal, intimate series of portraits and that is perhaps the reason it resonates so strongly.\u201d</p> <p>Mother is, indeed, a deeply moving book, not least for its simplicity: 14 portraits, all but one of which are studies of Graham\u2019s elderly mother, Dorothy, as she dozes in an armchair in an English retirement home. (The exception, in which she looks straight at the camera as if suddenly alert to its presence, appears like an almost accusatory jolt in the middle of the sequence.) There is no accompanying text, but the portraits speak quietly and heartbreakingly of intimate but universal subjects: unconditional love, familial duty and tenderness, the slow, inexorable passing of time, the silence that falls on and around the very old.</p> <p>\u201cMy mother was 88 when I started the series and she is 90 now,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/apr/11/paul-graham-interview-whitechapel-ohagan\">Graham, who is 63</a>. \u201cI suppose I wanted to somehow create an extended portrait of her in old age, a clear-eyed look at her and her last years on Earth. For myself, but also for my family. I have a young son now, and with that came the realisation of what it really means to look after a child. Plus, you find yourself reflecting on your own memories of being looked after as a child. It\u2019s the continuity of a line.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae565afb43ca7c82d8ae6d02be67d89237e3e386\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae565afb43ca7c82d8ae6d02be67d89237e3e386/0_0_871_1161/750.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I kept everything constant: the same chair, the same daylight through the window.\u2019\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I kept everything constant: the same chair, the same daylight through the window.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Graham</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What, though, prompted him to make a book of the images, to put them out in the world rather than keep them in the family? \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a difficult decision to make,\u201d he says. \u201cI asked my mum, of course, and she agreed, though to be honest, she would bless anything I do. And I trusted in my instinct. There is nothing embarrassing or undignified in the portraits. There are no fancy camera angles. I kept everything constant: the same chair, the same daylight through the window. The only things that change are her cardigans and tops. For me, it was a very conscious and contemplative process.\u201d</p> <p>The end result bears that out. Mother is, one one level, an exploration of old age as a kind of hinterland, a suspended state in which the world shrinks to the size of a room and consciousness fragments. Throughout, Graham\u2019s patient, painterly approach demands and repays attentiveness, and one\u2019s eye is drawn inevitably to small details: how the camera\u2019s focus shifts almost imperceptibly from portrait to portrait, highlighting the lines on his mother\u2019s face or the silvery grey of her hair.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I would sit there for hours listening to the ticking of the clock, the wind blowing outside, very consciously aware of time passing</p> <footer> <cite>Paul Graham</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There is nothing obtrusive, just light falling gently on a sleeping face and on the soft pinks and violets of a floral blouse.

This may, in part, be a reaction to his teenage years, which were spent amid the precisely ordered conformity of Harlow new town in Essex. An entirely self-taught photographer, his early books, such as <a href=\"http://www.paulgrahamarchive.com/a1.html#a\">A1 \u2013 the Great North Road (1983)</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/mar/02/paul-graham-shimmer-possibility\">Beyond Caring (1986)</a>, gave the impression that he belonged to a still unfolding tradition of British social documentary as practised by the likes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jan/05/the-big-picture-chris-killip-the-last-ships-tyne-wallsend\">Chris Killip</a> and Graham Smith.

      "bodyText": "Last month at the New York art book fair, three people approached Paul Graham independently to tell him how moved they were by his new book, Mother. \u201cThey essentially said the same thing, that it struck a deep chord with them,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s my most personal, intimate series of portraits and that is perhaps the reason it resonates so strongly.\u201d Mother is, indeed, a deeply moving book, not least for its simplicity: 14 portraits, all but one of which are studies of Graham\u2019s elderly mother, Dorothy, as she dozes in an armchair in an English retirement home. (The exception, in which she looks straight at the camera as if suddenly alert to its presence, appears like an almost accusatory jolt in the middle of the sequence.) There is no accompanying text, but the portraits speak quietly and heartbreakingly of intimate but universal subjects: unconditional love, familial duty and tenderness, the slow, inexorable passing of time, the silence that falls on and around the very old. \u201cMy mother was 88 when I started the series and she is 90 now,\u201d says Graham, who is 63. \u201cI suppose I wanted to somehow create an extended portrait of her in old age, a clear-eyed look at her and her last years on Earth. For myself, but also for my family. I have a young son now, and with that came the realisation of what it really means to look after a child. Plus, you find yourself reflecting on your own memories of being looked after as a child. It\u2019s the continuity of a line.\u201d What, though, prompted him to make a book of the images, to put them out in the world rather than keep them in the family? \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a difficult decision to make,\u201d he says. \u201cI asked my mum, of course, and she agreed, though to be honest, she would bless anything I do. And I trusted in my instinct. There is nothing embarrassing or undignified in the portraits. There are no fancy camera angles. I kept everything constant: the same chair, the same daylight through the window. The only things that change are her cardigans and tops. For me, it was a very conscious and contemplative process.\u201d The end result bears that out. Mother is, one one level, an exploration of old age as a kind of hinterland, a suspended state in which the world shrinks to the size of a room and consciousness fragments. Throughout, Graham\u2019s patient, painterly approach demands and repays attentiveness, and one\u2019s eye is drawn inevitably to small details: how the camera\u2019s focus shifts almost imperceptibly from portrait to portrait, highlighting the lines on his mother\u2019s face or the silvery grey of her hair. There is nothing obtrusive, just light falling gently on a sleeping face and on the soft pinks and violets of a floral blouse. I have long been fascinated by the idea of quiet photographs, but here the silence is almost Beckettian. \u201cI would sit there for hours,\u201d says Graham, \u201clistening to the ticking of the clock, the wind blowing outside, very aware of time passing. I knew I had to find some way of conveying the stretching and unravelling of time as I experienced it in that room.\u201d Graham has always been an artist concerned with the otherness of the everyday. This may, in part, be a reaction to his teenage years, which were spent amid the precisely ordered conformity of Harlow new town in Essex. An entirely self-taught photographer, his early books, such as A1 \u2013 the Great North Road (1983) and Beyond Caring (1986), gave the impression that he belonged to a still unfolding tradition of British social documentary as practised by the likes of Chris Killip and Graham Smith. The first clue that this was not the case came with 1994\u2019s Ceasefire, a photo-book about Northern Ireland published the same year as the IRA\u2019s actual ceasefire. It comprised images of the sky over Ballymurphy, the Bogside and various other neighbourhoods associated with the Troubles. American Night followed in 2003, some of its photographs printed to look almost opaque, a visual metaphor, he said at the time, for the disorientation he felt when working in the dazzling sunlight of the American south. Since then, the critically acclaimed and multi-volumed book, A Shimmer of Possibility (2007), and 2014\u2019s Does Yellow Run Forever? \u2013 images of rainbows in the west of Ireland, his partner sleeping, and American gold stores \u2013 have continued Graham\u2019s singular exploration of what he calls \u201celusive and nebulous subject matter\u201d. In 2001, he told me: \u201cThe photography I most respect pulls something out of the ether of nothingness.\u201d With Mother, he set himself a similar but different challenge: to evoke his mother\u2019s presence when that presence was becoming ever more elusive. Encroaching mortality may be the subtext, but the tenderness of Graham\u2019s gaze betokens something else: the weight of love and loss conveyed through the act of deep looking.

A staunch Catholic, he viewed the war and ensuing dictatorship as something of a religious crusade against anarchist, leftist and secular tendencies in Spain.

If all goes to plan, the 1.5-tonne slab that has covered the dictator\u2019s tomb will be lifted at 10.30am on Thursday and the coffin removed and flown by helicopter or taken by road to Mingorrubio-El Pardo municipal cemetery. Franco\u2019s remains have had pride of place in the basilica, which is 40 miles (64km) north-west of Madrid, since his death in 1975. Although the Valley of the Fallen and its 150-metre (490ft) cross ostensibly commemorate all those killed in the Spanish civil war, for many people, it serves only to glorify Franco and his four-decade dictatorship. The government said the dictator\u2019s remains needed to be moved as they could no longer \u201cremain in a public mausoleum that exalts his figure\u201d, adding that the removal would \u201csymbolically close the circle of Spanish democracy\u201d. The move has been bitterly opposed by the Franco family, the foundation that bears his name, and the Benedictine abbot who presides over the basilica. But after months of appeals and legal arguments, Spain\u2019s supreme court gave permission for the exhumation at the end of September. On Thursday morning, 22 members of the Franco family will gather in the basilica, along with Spain\u2019s justice minister, Dolores Delgado, in her role as first notary of the kingdom. A canopy has been erected to cover the grave and guard against any attempts to film the exhumation. Those present will be checked for electronic devices to make sure there are no images or sound recordings of the exhumation. Last Saturday, a journalist dressed as a monk and equipped with a climbing harness was arrested at the valley, allegedly while trying to gain access to the site to set up cameras. Once the heavy slab has been lifted using hydraulic jacks, the wooden coffin will be inspected to see how well it has endured 44 years of burial and checked for possible water damage. The coffin was surrounded with lead and concrete to protect it against underground streams. Franco\u2019s body is further protected by a zinc box within the coffin, which is expected to be in good condition. If necessary, the zinc box containing the remains will be placed in a new coffin. The exhumation phase could take between one and three hours, after which the remains will be blessed by the prior, Santiago Cantera, and the coffin carried out of the basilica by family members. If flying conditions are suitable, an air force helicopter will transport the body, Delgado and one Franco family member to Mingorrubio-El Pardo cemetery, a 15-minute flight from the valley. Airspace over the route will be closed to traffic and drones. If it is too foggy or windy, the coffin will be driven in a hearse, which could take 40 minutes. A private family service will be held inside the Franco mausoleum, where the dictator\u2019s widow, Carmen Polo, was buried after her death in 1988. At the family\u2019s request, mass will be said by Ram\u00f3n Tejero. The priest is the son of Antonio Tejero, the Guardia Civil lieutenant colonel who led the failed 1981 military coup that sought to seize control of the country after its return to democracy following Franco\u2019s death. According to the government, the exhumation and reinterment will cost about \u20ac63,000 (\u00a354,000). Twelve years ago, the previous socialist government of Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero introduced the historical memory law, which sought to help the country come to terms with its past and assist people in finding and exhuming the bodies of relatives killed in the civil war. About 100,000 victims of the conflict are thought to lie in the unmarked graves where they were buried during the conflict. Spain is believed to have more mass graves than any country except Cambodia. The Valley of the Fallen, partly built by the forced labour of political prisoners, is Spain\u2019s largest mass grave and holds the bodies of more than 33,000 people from both sides of the civil war. In July last year, the Spanish government announced plans to establish a truth commission to investigate crimes against humanity committed by the Franco regime. The government, led by the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, said it would compile a census of the victims of the civil war and the ensuing dictatorship, and also open an estimated 1,200 mass graves.",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s almost 10 years since the release of the last single-player Star Wars game, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/nov/14/star-wars-force-unleashed-2-review\">Force Unleashed II</a>, which feels a long time ago and a galaxy far, far away from EA\u2019s controversial <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/nov/19/star-wars-battlefront-game-review-force\">Battlefront</a> series. While those games offered some exhilarating moments of first-person blasting action, Star Wars fans have been longing for another epic adventure, something with the role-playing complexity of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2003/sep/04/games.shopping2\">Knights of the Old Republic</a> or the Force powers of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/sep/15/game.starwars\">Unleashed</a>. Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order promises to meet at least some of these criteria.</p> <p>Developed by Respawn Entertainment \u2013 the team behind sci-fi shooter series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/titanfall\">Titanfall</a> and battle royale hit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/feb/15/apex-legends-review-fortnite-has-some-stiff-competition\">Apex Legends</a> \u2013 Fallen Order introduces Cal Kestis, a Jedi padawan and one of the last of his kind. The game follows on from Revenge of the Sith, with the Jedi Order in ruin after being destroyed from within by Darth Vader. Cal had been forced into hiding when the Empire announces Order 66, demanding the extermination of all Jedi. Now it\u2019s time to fight back.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wWkQXUMQYI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1wWkQXUMQYI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>At the start of the game, however, Cal has been in hiding so long he has become completely disconnected from the Force and is unable to use his Jedi powers, a setup that echoes the story of Luke Skywalker in Star Wars: A New Hope. It\u2019s not about being a Jedi, it\u2019s about becoming one. Throughout the game, the player earns XP via combat and mission objectives, while an RPG-style skill tree helps emphasise the sense of progression as Cal rediscovers his Jedi powers and unlock new ones such as Dash Strike, a lightsaber lunge that\u2019s perfect for closing gaps during combat.</p> <p>At a recent press event in Los Angeles, journalists were given hands-on time with near-complete game code. Judging by this, the combat in Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order feels natural and intuitive, allowing players to combine Force powers with brutally elegant lightsaber strikes. Focusing on just two actions \u2013 attack and block \u2013 it\u2019s a simple system that soon gives access to a flurry of lightsaber moves, like the intuitive melee combat in a Batman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/20/batman-arkham-rocksteady-dark-knight-comic\">Arkham</a> title. With good timing, parries turn into counter attacks. You can even deflect blaster bolts directly back to the stormtrooper who fired them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/jul/05/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-feel-the-force-respawn-entertainment\">Can Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order help fans feel the Force?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The addition of Force powers allows for some pleasing combos. Using Force Push to deflect an incoming rocket as you rush lightsaber-first into a group of stormtroopers is exciting, but combat is often far more measured and grounded, especially when it comes to lightsaber duels. These structured boss fights have a cinematic feel, with cut scenes punctuating longer, drawn out fights. Lightsaber duels are an iconic part of Star Wars and here they don\u2019t feel like easy wins. Battling the Ninth Sister (a member of Darth Vader\u2019s Inquisitorius) is a fight for survival, and learning to anticipate and counter her moves is key. It\u2019s clear Respawn wants players to get a true sense of accomplishment from taking down formidable foes, and has perhaps been looking toward <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/jun/01/dark-souls-remastered-review-dark-fantasy-rpg-makes-glorious-return\">Dark Souls</a> for this sense of tactical challenge.</p> <p>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order also introduces a new Force ability, Force Slow: a bullet-time system that allows Cal to manipulate enemies and objects in extended time. We saw something similar in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/star-wars-episode-vii\">The Force Awakens</a>, where Kylo Ren slows a blaster bolt in midair. But here it creates interesting new gameplay dynamics, locking down enemies for a few seconds and giving you time to thin out waves of stormtroopers before taking on their commander.</p> <p>According to Respawn CEO Vince Zampella, the addition of a fresh Jedi ability required some negotiation. \u201cWe worked with the story group to hone what\u2019s acceptable and what\u2019s not, and to figure out how to play within the rules of the Star Wars universe,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was back and forth on how that should work and how much is okay. Everyone thinks through all the implications of what anything new could be. It\u2019s a gigantic universe and we\u2019re playing in a small piece of it. They have to worry about what implications it has for everything.\u201d</p> <p>As your powers grow, so do your Force Slow options: an upgrade unlocked via the skill tree allows you to target entire groups of enemies at the same time, accentuating the crowd control possibilities.</p> <p>Learning the classic Force Push ability, which shoves enemies around the landscape, allows for some interesting combos, too. A Force Slowed stormtrooper can be used as a barrier, which you can then hurl at other enemies with a quick Force Push. Force Slow can also help with some of the trickier platforming aspects, and it\u2019s essential to progress past certain quick-moving obstacles. It\u2019s here, however, that the ability starts to feel a little stale: stopping a fan so that you can move between its blades is a tiresomely familiar mechanic.</p> <p>Interestingly, Fallen Order adds <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/tomb-raider\">Tomb Raider</a>-style puzzles, with a Star Wars twist. Throughout the game, there are environmental enigmas to solve, often blocking progression by way of a closed-off route. At times, it feels like Lara Croft with a lightsaber, but the addition of Force powers creates some unique challenges you won\u2019t find in the Tomb Raider universe. Right now, progression can feel a little frustrating \u2013 the HUD is minimal, and it\u2019s often not obvious where you have to go, especially when certain puzzles involve doubling back on yourself multiple times. The lack of a waypoint means you\u2019ll have to pay extra attention to your map.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1070d13a47656df5f76a06f87c1bbba285dfe90\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1070d13a47656df5f76a06f87c1bbba285dfe90/35_0_1363_818/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order brings back some familiar enemies and allies, including Forest Whitaker\u2019s Saw Gerrera.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order brings back some familiar enemies and allies, including Forest Whitaker\u2019s Saw Gerrera.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: EA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Between mission areas, you\u2019re on Cal\u2019s starship, the Stinger Mantis. Designed by Doug Chiang, who worked on The Force Awakens and Rogue One, it feels like a classic Star Wars craft. Indeed, the design throughout Fallen Order hits a perfect Star Wars sweet spot, capturing the aesthetic of the old movies while doing its own thing. Your companion robot, BD-1, is a good example, acting as a lighthearted tension breaker in a clear reference to R2-D2. There are some familiar characters, too, with Forest Whitaker back as Saw Gerrera. It\u2019s clear there will be other appearances from well-loved Star Wars movie characters as the game progresses.</p> <p>As a game, Fallen Order\u2019s key features are extremely familiar, combining popular elements of other franchises rather than taking major risks. It\u2019s clearly inspired by big narrative adventures such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/apr/12/god-of-war-review-violent-vengeful-and-more-brilliant-than-ever\">God of War</a>, as well as action RPGs such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/28/mass-effect-andromeda-tips-beginners\">Mass Effect</a>. There\u2019s an emphasis on the emotional journey, on personal progression, and on skill trees and personalisation \u2013 such as the ability to customise your lightsaber with a variety of hilts, crystals, switches and sleeves, which can be discovered throughout the world.</p> <p>But at this stage, the key takeaway is that Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order feels like a proper Star Wars game \u2013 and more than that, a proper Star Wars story. \u201cThere are definitely some emotional pieces in there,\u201d says Zampella. \u201cWe can\u2019t talk about them, but there\u2019s some moments that are like \u2018ahhhh\u2019. As a Star Wars fan, it\u2019s a dream come true to be able to portray that.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.ea.com/games/starwars/jedi-fallen-order\">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</a> is released on 15 November for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.</p>",

Developed by Respawn Entertainment \u2013 the team behind sci-fi shooter series Titanfall and battle royale hit Apex Legends \u2013 Fallen Order introduces Cal Kestis, a Jedi padawan and one of the last of his kind. The game follows on from Revenge of the Sith, with the Jedi Order in ruin after being destroyed from within by Darth Vader. Cal had been forced into hiding when the Empire announces Order 66, demanding the extermination of all Jedi. Now it\u2019s time to fight back. At the start of the game, however, Cal has been in hiding so long he has become completely disconnected from the Force and is unable to use his Jedi powers, a setup that echoes the story of Luke Skywalker in Star Wars: A New Hope. It\u2019s not about being a Jedi, it\u2019s about becoming one. Throughout the game, the player earns XP via combat and mission objectives, while an RPG-style skill tree helps emphasise the sense of progression as Cal rediscovers his Jedi powers and unlock new ones such as Dash Strike, a lightsaber lunge that\u2019s perfect for closing gaps during combat. At a recent press event in Los Angeles, journalists were given hands-on time with near-complete game code. Judging by this, the combat in Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order feels natural and intuitive, allowing players to combine Force powers with brutally elegant lightsaber strikes. Focusing on just two actions \u2013 attack and block \u2013 it\u2019s a simple system that soon gives access to a flurry of lightsaber moves, like the intuitive melee combat in a Batman Arkham title. With good timing, parries turn into counter attacks. You can even deflect blaster bolts directly back to the stormtrooper who fired them. The addition of Force powers allows for some pleasing combos. Using Force Push to deflect an incoming rocket as you rush lightsaber-first into a group of stormtroopers is exciting, but combat is often far more measured and grounded, especially when it comes to lightsaber duels. These structured boss fights have a cinematic feel, with cut scenes punctuating longer, drawn out fights. Lightsaber duels are an iconic part of Star Wars and here they don\u2019t feel like easy wins. Battling the Ninth Sister (a member of Darth Vader\u2019s Inquisitorius) is a fight for survival, and learning to anticipate and counter her moves is key. It\u2019s clear Respawn wants players to get a true sense of accomplishment from taking down formidable foes, and has perhaps been looking toward Dark Souls for this sense of tactical challenge. Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order also introduces a new Force ability, Force Slow: a bullet-time system that allows Cal to manipulate enemies and objects in extended time. We saw something similar in The Force Awakens, where Kylo Ren slows a blaster bolt in midair. But here it creates interesting new gameplay dynamics, locking down enemies for a few seconds and giving you time to thin out waves of stormtroopers before taking on their commander. According to Respawn CEO Vince Zampella, the addition of a fresh Jedi ability required some negotiation. \u201cWe worked with the story group to hone what\u2019s acceptable and what\u2019s not, and to figure out how to play within the rules of the Star Wars universe,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was back and forth on how that should work and how much is okay. Everyone thinks through all the implications of what anything new could be. It\u2019s a gigantic universe and we\u2019re playing in a small piece of it. They have to worry about what implications it has for everything.\u201d As your powers grow, so do your Force Slow options: an upgrade unlocked via the skill tree allows you to target entire groups of enemies at the same time, accentuating the crowd control possibilities. Learning the classic Force Push ability, which shoves enemies around the landscape, allows for some interesting combos, too. A Force Slowed stormtrooper can be used as a barrier, which you can then hurl at other enemies with a quick Force Push. Force Slow can also help with some of the trickier platforming aspects, and it\u2019s essential to progress past certain quick-moving obstacles. It\u2019s here, however, that the ability starts to feel a little stale: stopping a fan so that you can move between its blades is a tiresomely familiar mechanic. Interestingly, Fallen Order adds Tomb Raider-style puzzles, with a Star Wars twist. Throughout the game, there are environmental enigmas to solve, often blocking progression by way of a closed-off route. At times, it feels like Lara Croft with a lightsaber, but the addition of Force powers creates some unique challenges you won\u2019t find in the Tomb Raider universe. Right now, progression can feel a little frustrating \u2013 the HUD is minimal, and it\u2019s often not obvious where you have to go, especially when certain puzzles involve doubling back on yourself multiple times. The lack of a waypoint means you\u2019ll have to pay extra attention to your map. Between mission areas, you\u2019re on Cal\u2019s starship, the Stinger Mantis. Designed by Doug Chiang, who worked on The Force Awakens and Rogue One, it feels like a classic Star Wars craft. Indeed, the design throughout Fallen Order hits a perfect Star Wars sweet spot, capturing the aesthetic of the old movies while doing its own thing. Your companion robot, BD-1, is a good example, acting as a lighthearted tension breaker in a clear reference to R2-D2. There are some familiar characters, too, with Forest Whitaker back as Saw Gerrera. It\u2019s clear there will be other appearances from well-loved Star Wars movie characters as the game progresses. As a game, Fallen Order\u2019s key features are extremely familiar, combining popular elements of other franchises rather than taking major risks. It\u2019s clearly inspired by big narrative adventures such as God of War, as well as action RPGs such as Mass Effect. There\u2019s an emphasis on the emotional journey, on personal progression, and on skill trees and personalisation \u2013 such as the ability to customise your lightsaber with a variety of hilts, crystals, switches and sleeves, which can be discovered throughout the world. But at this stage, the key takeaway is that Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order feels like a proper Star Wars game \u2013 and more than that, a proper Star Wars story. \u201cThere are definitely some emotional pieces in there,\u201d says Zampella. \u201cWe can\u2019t talk about them, but there\u2019s some moments that are like \u2018ahhhh\u2019. As a Star Wars fan, it\u2019s a dream come true to be able to portray that.\u201d \u2022 Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is released on 15 November for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.",

      "bodyText": "Metro Bank\u2019s founder has resigned as chairman with immediate effect weeks before he was expected to step down, leaving his successor to handle a regulatory investigation into an accounting error. The high street challenger said Vernon Hill, who founded the bank in 2010, would stay on as a non-executive director until 31 December. He has been granted the honorary position of emeritus chairman in recognition of his \u201cextraordinary contribution to Metro Bank\u201d, the lender said in a regulatory announcement. Sir Michael Snyder, a member of the board, will serve as interim chairman until a replacement is found. Hill will continue receiving his full chairman\u2019s pay over the next two months, despite his scaled-down role, including a \u00a310,000 monthly travel allowance. The announcement was made before the publication of the bank\u2019s third-quarter results on Wednesday afternoon. They showed a loss of \u00a36.7m in the three months to September, compared with \u00a3900,000 in thesecond quarter . This was due in part to continuing costs linked to its \u201ctransformation and remediation programmes\u201d, which are meant to cut costs and address its accounting error. Metro Bank did not provide comparative figures for 2018, but said it swung to an underlying loss of \u00a32.2m compared to a \u00a315.1m profit last year. The bank was also hit by \u00a3235m worth of deposit outflows from large business customers last month after it spooked markets by postponing a crucial bond sale. Its chief executive, Craig Donaldson, said the bank was evaluating its future growth plans, signalling that it intends to reveal a fresh strategy when it reports its full-year results next year. It has been a turbulent period for the bank, which is still awaiting the outcome of an investigation by City regulators after it classified \u00a3900m of loans as less risky than they actually were. Metro originally announced in July that Hill would step down as chairman but stay on the board as a non-executive director and president. However, by the start of this month the plan had changed and it said he would step down from the board entirely by the end of the year. The bank is trying to repair its reputation after a string of controversies, including the payment of \u00a325m in fees to an architecture firm owned by Hill\u2019s wife, Shirley. John Cronin, a financial analyst at the stockbroker Goodbody, said: \u201cWhile we don\u2019t know what is behind the early departure, we have heard the murmurs around regulatory discontent in the context of Hill remaining on the board. Of course, Hill may have simply just had enough.\u201d Snyder said: \u201cThe board thanks Vernon for his vision, which inspired and created Metro Bank 10 years ago.

The message to all of us was clear: the rights of Sterigenics to make a profit mattered more to the IEPA than the rights of thousands of people living in its vicinity not to be subjected to cancer-causing air.

Taylor\u2019s explosive testimony marks \u2018sea change\u2019, say Dems The acting US ambassador to Kyiv has told Congress that Donald Trump repeatedly pressed Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden in return for the release of US military aid. In the most damning testimony of the impeachment inquiry so far, Bill Taylor said soon after taking the post in June, he grew concerned \u201cour relationship with Ukraine was being fundamentally undermined by an irregular informal channel of US policymaking, and by the withholding of vital security assistance for domestic political reasons\u201d. \u2018Lynching\u2019 comparison. Trump faced fresh criticism on Tuesday, including from Republican lawmakers, after describing the impeachment inquiry on Twitter as a \u201clynching\u201d. Anonymous official. The anonymous Trump official who wrote a controversial New York Times op-ed last year, describing an internal \u201cresistance\u201d movement to thwart the president, has written a book on the subject, set to be published in November. Turkey and Russia agree deal for buffer zone in northern Syria The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, have agreed to carve up territory previously controlled by Kurdish forces in northern Syria, creating a Turkish \u201csafe zone\u201d and cementing Moscow\u2019s new role as the region\u2019s leading powerbroker. The deal, which Erdo\u011fan described as \u201chistoric,\u201d, was hashed out in more than six hours of talks in the Russian Black Sea city of Sochi on Tuesday. Border control. Turkish troops will remain in the zones they have occupied since their offensive began this month, at the expense of Kurdish-led forces, while Russian troops and the Syrian army will control the remainder of the Turkish-Syrian border. Booker bill would fight neglected diseases of poverty Cory Booker has introduced a Senate bill aimed at detecting and eradicating diseases that are commonly associated with developing countries, but which have flourished among the poor in the US. The Study, Treat Observe and Prevent Neglected Diseases of Poverty Act \u2013 or Stop for short \u2013 targets illnesses such as hookworm and dengue fever, which thrive amid communities enduring extreme poverty, substandard housing and sanitation or unsafe drinking water, affecting as many as 12 million Americans. \u2018Appalling realities\u2019. The 2020 Democratic presidential candidate previously backed similar legislation on environmental justice and drinking water. \u201cAcross the poorest parts of our country people are facing appalling realities that would shock the consciousness of many Americans,\u201d he said. China reportedly plans to replace Hong Kong chief China is reportedly planning to replace Carrie Lam, Hong Kong\u2019s embattled chief executive, with an interim leader next year. Lam has been the focal point for the territory\u2019s pro-democracy protests, which began in June as she attempted to pass a controversial extradition bill. That bill was at last formally withdrawn on Wednesday, just as the murder suspect whose case prompted its creation was released from prison in Hong Kong. NBA blackout. China\u2019s state broadcaster CCTV did not broadcast any NBA games on the opening day of the new season, a break from tradition apparently resulting from the dispute over a tweet in support of Hong Kong protesters by the Houston Rockets general manager, Daryl Morey. Cheat sheet Civil rights groups and tech experts have warned a new rule proposed by the Trump administration\u2019s housing department would make it \u201cnearly impossible\u201d for Americans to sue for housing discrimination caused by computer algorithms. Former homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said repeatedly: \u201cI don\u2019t regret enforcing the law\u201d over her part in the family separation policy, during an interview at Fortune magazine\u2019s most powerful women summit on Tuesday. British MPs have blocked Boris Johnson\u2019s attempt to ram his Brexit agreement through parliament in time for the country to leave the European Union by 31 October, raising the likelihood of a further extension to the departure deadline. Two members of the far-right Proud Boys group have been sentenced to four years in prison for their roles in a vicious street fight with anti-fascist protesters outside an event at New York\u2019s Metropolitan Republican Club last year. Must-reads S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s anti-Bolsonaro underground music scene S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s underground musical community vehemently opposed the election of Brazil\u2019s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro. Now they are expressing their resistance to his regime, not with bossa nova, but through a lesser-known Brazilian tradition of hardcore and post-punk, as Philip Bloomfield discovers. Pulitzer winner chronicles One Day in America Gene Weingarten chose the subject of his new book at random, asking strangers to pick a date from a hat \u2013 28 December 1986 \u2013 and then delving into the events, large and small, of that single day across the US. \u201cThe deeper you drill into anything, the more eerily intertwined things become,\u201d he tells Adrian Horton. Gullah Geechee nation fears a climate wipeout The Gullah Geechee nation is a small, distinct cultural community made up of descendants of African slaves and native Americans, who today live on the low-lying coastal fringes of South Carolina and Georgia. That puts them on the frontline of the climate crisis, as Oliver Milman reports. The lost history of Soviet hippies The Soviet hippy subculture of the 1960s and 70s was inspired by the west, shaped by communism and closely monitored by the KGB. Now it is the subject of a new documentary by the Estonian writer-director Terje Toomistu. \u201cIn the west, nobody was arrested simply for having long hair,\u201d he tells Luke Harding. Opinion Hinsdale is listed in the top 1% of the wealthiest towns in Illinois. But its privileged position among Chicago\u2019s suburbs did not protect the community from potentially deadly corporate pollution, says Hinsdale resident Chantal Panozzo.

In built-up areas they are parked on the roadside or left in large car parks. The RAC estimates there are <a href=\"https://www.racfoundation.org/assets/rac_foundation/content/downloadables/facts_on_parking.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">between 17,000 and 20,000 non-residential car parks in Great Britain</a> providing between 3m and 4m spaces.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6ed8df79a33d5ad2af45f164a56695034b9377a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ed8df79a33d5ad2af45f164a56695034b9377a3/0_0_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Detail of city streets\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>By contrast, CAVs will no longer have to remain at their destination. They could drop passengers, move on, pick up new ones and eventually park on the periphery in stacked spaces when not needed. Meanwhile, fleets managed by lift-sharing companies could further bridge private car ownership and public transport. These trends would likely free up road space and render large car parks in town centres increasingly unnecessary.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/provoking-progress/2019/oct/23/fail-fast-fail-often-why-its-time-to-move-on-from-this-over-hyped-mantra\">Fail fast, fail often: why it\u2019s time to move on from this over-hyped mantra</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are signs this is already happening: Amsterdam recently announced planning to <a href=\"https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2019/03/amsterdam-cars-parking-spaces-bike-lanes-trees-green-left/586108/\" rel=\"nofollow\">eliminate 11,000 parking spaces</a> by 2025 \u2013 they\u2019ll be replaced by trees, bike parking, and wider pavements.</p> <p>\u201cA huge amount of infrastructure dedicated to parking could be freed up for new development,\u201d says Baumgardner. \u201cIn antique cities, such as New York and London, where housing is at a premium, those spaces could be converted to homes or offices. Some architects argue you can\u2019t make a class A apartment out of a garage, but they used to say that about old industrial buildings. People who are creative with these spaces will reap the benefits. And if you can\u2019t make money out of it from housing then freed-up space could be converted into parks.\u201d</p> <p>Tom Cohen at the Centre for Transport Studies, University College London, agrees: \u201cGarages could be superfluous to electric cars. Reusing central space is a very attractive thought, but that will have to mean fewer vehicles all round.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, if autonomous vehicle use is made cheaper and more convenient, there is always the possibility that traffic will actually increase, thanks to greater demand. The hope is that their connectedness will mitigate for that. For example, improved algorithms might mean that cars could travel closer together and avoid bottlenecks by sharing information. The data they generate could allow congestion charging at peak times to control journeys and raise revenue lost from parking.</p> <p>In the city of Wuxi, China, Audi is working with local government to smooth traffic flow by using data to help cars adjust their speed to catch more green lights. The system, called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHgpATg-FQU\" rel=\"nofollow\">Audi Traffic Light Information (TLI)</a>, uses data shared between cars and traffic management infrastructure.</p> <p>Other possibilities include CAVs being allowed to travel much faster on designated routes, which would mean commuting distances could increase. Another potential avenue is to step up the segregation of space. \u201cIf you look at Hong Kong, you have a city where pedestrians and vehicles are already separated to some extent,\u201d says Baumgardner. \u201cPeople use skyways, vehicles have unrestricted road space, almost the way you could imagine an autonomous city operating in the future if you scale it up.\u201d</p> <p>Amid all the utopian visions of the future, however, Cohen sounds a note of caution. He is currently working on a two-year project titled <a href=\"https://driverless-futures.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Driverless Futures?</a> funded by the Economic and Social Research Council. \u201cWe need to govern the emergence of this technology in a positive and constructive way before it\u2019s too late,\u201d he says. \u201cCurrently policy is being led by innovation, but that needs careful analysis to ensure its practical application is not overlooked.\u201d</p> <p>Many businesses approach technological change by trying to balance the competing impulses of open-minded enthusiasm and soberly considered scepticism. But the advent of driverless cars shows us that, when we think through the wide-ranging ramifications of technology fully enough, enthusiasm and careful consideration can be the same thing.</p>",

The RAC estimates there are between 17,000 and 20,000 non-residential car parks in Great Britain providing between 3m and 4m spaces. By contrast, CAVs will no longer have to remain at their destination. They could drop passengers, move on, pick up new ones and eventually park on the periphery in stacked spaces when not needed. Meanwhile, fleets managed by lift-sharing companies could further bridge private car ownership and public transport. These trends would likely free up road space and render large car parks in town centres increasingly unnecessary. There are signs this is already happening: Amsterdam recently announced planning to eliminate 11,000 parking spaces by 2025 \u2013 they\u2019ll be replaced by trees, bike parking, and wider pavements. \u201cA huge amount of infrastructure dedicated to parking could be freed up for new development,\u201d says Baumgardner. \u201cIn antique cities, such as New York and London, where housing is at a premium, those spaces could be converted to homes or offices. Some architects argue you can\u2019t make a class A apartment out of a garage, but they used to say that about old industrial buildings. People who are creative with these spaces will reap the benefits. And if you can\u2019t make money out of it from housing then freed-up space could be converted into parks.\u201d Tom Cohen at the Centre for Transport Studies, University College London, agrees: \u201cGarages could be superfluous to electric cars. Reusing central space is a very attractive thought, but that will have to mean fewer vehicles all round.\u201d Of course, if autonomous vehicle use is made cheaper and more convenient, there is always the possibility that traffic will actually increase, thanks to greater demand. The hope is that their connectedness will mitigate for that. For example, improved algorithms might mean that cars could travel closer together and avoid bottlenecks by sharing information. The data they generate could allow congestion charging at peak times to control journeys and raise revenue lost from parking. In the city of Wuxi, China, Audi is working with local government to smooth traffic flow by using data to help cars adjust their speed to catch more green lights. The system, called Audi Traffic Light Information (TLI), uses data shared between cars and traffic management infrastructure. Other possibilities include CAVs being allowed to travel much faster on designated routes, which would mean commuting distances could increase. Another potential avenue is to step up the segregation of space. \u201cIf you look at Hong Kong, you have a city where pedestrians and vehicles are already separated to some extent,\u201d says Baumgardner. \u201cPeople use skyways, vehicles have unrestricted road space, almost the way you could imagine an autonomous city operating in the future if you scale it up.\u201d Amid all the utopian visions of the future, however, Cohen sounds a note of caution. He is currently working on a two-year project titled Driverless Futures? funded by the Economic and Social Research Council. \u201cWe need to govern the emergence of this technology in a positive and constructive way before it\u2019s too late,\u201d he says. \u201cCurrently policy is being led by innovation, but that needs careful analysis to ensure its practical application is not overlooked.\u201d Many businesses approach technological change by trying to balance the competing impulses of open-minded enthusiasm and soberly considered scepticism. But the advent of driverless cars shows us that, when we think through the wide-ranging ramifications of technology fully enough, enthusiasm and careful consideration can be the same thing.",

      "body": "<p>We are all drawn to the night. It\u2019s a hidden world full of danger, magic, excitement, night shifts and nights out. Out in the dark, landscapes that were familiar to us in daylight are transformed. The darkness smothers both the beautiful and the bad, and it reminds us of the things we can never know, and never conquer \u2013 although we try our best with coffee and blue screens.</p> <p>I was drawn to write about the landscape after dark because I love being outside beneath the night sky. When the rest of the world is asleep and you are alone in nature, there is nothing so peaceful and restorative as gazing up at the stars \u2013 and the thrill of being out in the dark keeps me on my toes. Looking up at the night sky has helped me to find a wider perspective on my place in the universe. Not only are my everyday problems diminished when I remember how small we all are, but I am filled with wonder at how lucky I am that the right atoms came together to form my mind and body.</p> <p>The night has captured our imaginations since the beginning of time. After all, half our lifetimes are spent in darkness, and when our instincts kick in and our more primitive senses are heightened, who knows what weird and wonderful stories will unearth themselves? As Byron wrote in his poem Manfred, at night we can learn \u201cthe language of another world\u201d.</p> <p>Here are 10 of my favourite books featuring the night:</p> <p><strong>1. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/an-astronomer-s-tale-9781784754389.html\">An Astronomer\u2019s Tale: A Bricklayer\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy</a> by Gary Fildes<br></strong>Earlier this year, I visited Kielder Observatory in Northumberland and picked up this book written by the man who founded it. Not only is it a beautiful nature memoir about understanding the night sky, it\u2019s also a wonderful reminder of how anyone, no matter where life has taken them, can follow their dreams and aspirations. Fildes left school at 16 and entered the building trade, but after years of harbouring a secret love for astronomy, he finally followed his passion and helped to bring thousands of other people closer to the stars.</p> <p><strong>2. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/jul/30/jonathanbouquet\">The Midnight Folk</a> by John Masefield<br></strong>A childhood classic filled with everything the young imagination might conjure up from the shadows: witches, wizards, talking animals, seafaring adventures and rides on flying broomsticks. Young Kay Harker sets out on a midnight quest to recover a long-lost treasure stolen from his great-grandfather, but soon finds himself up against dark and terrible forces and must rely on his friends, the \u201cmidnight folk\u201d, to help him. Often frightening but always enchanting, this was always a favourite story of mine to read by lamplight.</p> <p><strong>3. <a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/acquainted-with-the-night-9781596917682/\">Acquainted with the Night: Excursions </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/acquainted-with-the-night-9781596917682/\">Through the World After Dark</a> by Christopher Dewdney<br></strong>The Canadian author takes his reader on a beautifully woven journey through our relationship with the night, from science and art to storytelling and anthropology, examining our love for sunsets, fireworks, astronomy, nightclubs, sleep and bedtime stories. His writing is engaging and poetic, speckled with comedic anecdotes and rich in detail. Part fact, part philosophy, this is the perfect read for sleepless nights.</p> <p><strong>4. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/tristessa-9780241388990.html\">Tristessa</a> by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jul/24/jack-kerouac-13-volume-memoir\">Jack Kerouac</a><br></strong>This noisy and humid novella-memoir takes place on the Mexican streets, as the protagonist travels through the night to visit the morphine-racked sex worker he believes he has fallen in love with. An uncomfortable tale, ebbing and flowing between the pain of its impoverished characters and the cyclical numbing of their addictions.</p> <p><strong>5. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-night-is-darkening-round-me-9780141398471.html\">The Night is Darkening Round Me</a> by Emily Bronte\u0308<br></strong>A poem to share with friends on a dark and stormy night, this is one of the most evocative and menacing verses from my favourite Bronte\u0308 sister. Its descriptions of the wild, untameable weather and the unexplained tension captured in the repeated phrase \u201cI will not, cannot go\u201d pull the reader right back into the shadowy corners of Wuthering Heights.</p> <p><strong>6. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/04/the-taxidermists-daughter-kate-mosse-review-novel\">The Taxidermist\u2019s Daughter by Kate Mosse</a><br></strong>Mosse is the master of eerie historical thrillers and this 2014 novel, based around a remote stretch of the Sussex coast, does not disappoint. Opening as residents gather in a misty churchyard to celebrate St Mark\u2019s Eve \u2013 a night when the ghosts of those fated to die in the coming year are said to appear \u2013it plunges into a shadowy world of murder, secrets and amnesia. Delightfully disturbing, impossible to put down.</p> <p><strong>7. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/nightwalk-9780007448708.html\">Nightwalk</a> by Chris Yates<br></strong>For those drawn to nature writing, Nightwalk is a magical journey into the author\u2019s intimate relationship with the outdoors. His love of walking and angling have given him a gift for deep observation, noticing every slight shift in his surroundings, every bird call and blossoming flower. Yates watches the countryside landscape change as night falls, inviting readers to slow down and take notice of the world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"afe6ed8fadfe0a645c0af8885cdfdfa625ef28e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/afe6ed8fadfe0a645c0af8885cdfdfa625ef28e8/191_51_998_599/500.jpg\" alt=\"Gwendoline Christie as Titania, David Moorst as Puck and Oliver Chris as Oberon in the Bridge Theatre\u2019s 2019 production of A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gwendoline Christie as Titania, David Moorst as Puck and Oliver Chris as Oberon in the Bridge Theatre\u2019s 2019 production of A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bridge Theatre/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>8. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/apr/10/best-shakespeare-productions-a-midsummer-nights-dream\">A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream by William Shakespeare</a><br></strong>\u201cIll met by moonlight, proud Titania.\u201d The original midnight adventure, Shakespeare\u2019s most enchanting comedy follows four Athenian lovers as they are manipulated by a herd of forest fairies intent on causing mischief. While Samuel Pepys called it \u201cthe most insipid, ridiculous play\u201d he ever saw, it remains one of Shakespeare\u2019s best-known and most adored comedies.</p> <p><strong>9. At Night: A Journey Round Britain from Dusk Till Dawn by Dixe Wills<br></strong>A travel guide with a difference, Wills approaches nightwalking from a more practical angle, exploring how familiar landscapes change during darkness. He meanders gently between geography and history, and offers his readers useful tips on walking safely in the dark, enjoying what our nocturnal landscapes have to offer.</p> <p><strong>10. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jul/14/end-night-paul-bogard-review\">The End of Night: Searching for Natural Darkness in an Age of Artificial Light</a> by Paul Bogard<br></strong>Light pollution may not get as much attention as the climate crisis and air pollution, but it is a growing environmental problem, researched meticulously by Bogard. He asks why dark skies are so important to people and wildlife, exploring both nature conservation and our ancestral connection with the night sky.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/dark-skies-9781472964595.html\">Dark Skies by Tiffany Francis-Baker</a> is published by Bloomsbury.</p>",

      "bodyText": "We are all drawn to the night. It\u2019s a hidden world full of danger, magic, excitement, night shifts and nights out. Out in the dark, landscapes that were familiar to us in daylight are transformed. The darkness smothers both the beautiful and the bad, and it reminds us of the things we can never know, and never conquer \u2013 although we try our best with coffee and blue screens. I was drawn to write about the landscape after dark because I love being outside beneath the night sky. When the rest of the world is asleep and you are alone in nature, there is nothing so peaceful and restorative as gazing up at the stars \u2013 and the thrill of being out in the dark keeps me on my toes. Looking up at the night sky has helped me to find a wider perspective on my place in the universe. Not only are my everyday problems diminished when I remember how small we all are, but I am filled with wonder at how lucky I am that the right atoms came together to form my mind and body. The night has captured our imaginations since the beginning of time. After all, half our lifetimes are spent in darkness, and when our instincts kick in and our more primitive senses are heightened, who knows what weird and wonderful stories will unearth themselves? As Byron wrote in his poem Manfred, at night we can learn \u201cthe language of another world\u201d. Here are 10 of my favourite books featuring the night: 1. An Astronomer\u2019s Tale: A Bricklayer\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy by Gary Fildes Earlier this year, I visited Kielder Observatory in Northumberland and picked up this book written by the man who founded it. Not only is it a beautiful nature memoir about understanding the night sky, it\u2019s also a wonderful reminder of how anyone, no matter where life has taken them, can follow their dreams and aspirations. Fildes left school at 16 and entered the building trade, but after years of harbouring a secret love for astronomy, he finally followed his passion and helped to bring thousands of other people closer to the stars. 2. The Midnight Folk by John Masefield A childhood classic filled with everything the young imagination might conjure up from the shadows: witches, wizards, talking animals, seafaring adventures and rides on flying broomsticks. Young Kay Harker sets out on a midnight quest to recover a long-lost treasure stolen from his great-grandfather, but soon finds himself up against dark and terrible forces and must rely on his friends, the \u201cmidnight folk\u201d, to help him. Often frightening but always enchanting, this was always a favourite story of mine to read by lamplight. 3. Acquainted with the Night: Excursions Through the World After Dark by Christopher Dewdney The Canadian author takes his reader on a beautifully woven journey through our relationship with the night, from science and art to storytelling and anthropology, examining our love for sunsets, fireworks, astronomy, nightclubs, sleep and bedtime stories. His writing is engaging and poetic, speckled with comedic anecdotes and rich in detail. Part fact, part philosophy, this is the perfect read for sleepless nights. 4. Tristessa by Jack Kerouac This noisy and humid novella-memoir takes place on the Mexican streets, as the protagonist travels through the night to visit the morphine-racked sex worker he believes he has fallen in love with. An uncomfortable tale, ebbing and flowing between the pain of its impoverished characters and the cyclical numbing of their addictions. 5. The Night is Darkening Round Me by Emily Bronte\u0308 A poem to share with friends on a dark and stormy night, this is one of the most evocative and menacing verses from my favourite Bronte\u0308 sister. Its descriptions of the wild, untameable weather and the unexplained tension captured in the repeated phrase \u201cI will not, cannot go\u201d pull the reader right back into the shadowy corners of Wuthering Heights. 6. The Taxidermist\u2019s Daughter by Kate Mosse Mosse is the master of eerie historical thrillers and this 2014 novel, based around a remote stretch of the Sussex coast, does not disappoint. Opening as residents gather in a misty churchyard to celebrate St Mark\u2019s Eve \u2013 a night when the ghosts of those fated to die in the coming year are said to appear \u2013it plunges into a shadowy world of murder, secrets and amnesia. Delightfully disturbing, impossible to put down. 7. Nightwalk by Chris Yates For those drawn to nature writing, Nightwalk is a magical journey into the author\u2019s intimate relationship with the outdoors. His love of walking and angling have given him a gift for deep observation, noticing every slight shift in his surroundings, every bird call and blossoming flower. Yates watches the countryside landscape change as night falls, inviting readers to slow down and take notice of the world. 8. A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream by William Shakespeare \u201cIll met by moonlight, proud Titania.\u201d The original midnight adventure, Shakespeare\u2019s most enchanting comedy follows four Athenian lovers as they are manipulated by a herd of forest fairies intent on causing mischief. While Samuel Pepys called it \u201cthe most insipid, ridiculous play\u201d he ever saw, it remains one of Shakespeare\u2019s best-known and most adored comedies. 9. At Night: A Journey Round Britain from Dusk Till Dawn by Dixe Wills A travel guide with a difference, Wills approaches nightwalking from a more practical angle, exploring how familiar landscapes change during darkness. He meanders gently between geography and history, and offers his readers useful tips on walking safely in the dark, enjoying what our nocturnal landscapes have to offer. 10. The End of Night: Searching for Natural Darkness in an Age of Artificial Light by Paul Bogard Light pollution may not get as much attention as the climate crisis and air pollution, but it is a growing environmental problem, researched meticulously by Bogard. He asks why dark skies are so important to people and wildlife, exploring both nature conservation and our ancestral connection with the night sky. \u2022 Dark Skies by Tiffany Francis-Baker is published by Bloomsbury.",

For spring/summer 2019, every model at Prada wore padded designs, from pink satin to black and beaded. Brands including Erdem, Dolce &amp; Gabbana and Simone Rocha have had them, too. The more ornate ones have also been linked to the Renaissance being so hot right now \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/shortcuts/2019/oct/16/renaissancecore-why-everyone-is-dressing-like-anne-boleyn\" title=\"\">a portrait of Anne Boleyn from circa 1533 has the then-queen wearing a very 2019 pearl headband</a>. Accessorize is selling a simple, black style called the Boleyn for \u00a39.</p> <p>Headbands have history before 1533. Fashion historian Tony Glenville says they can be traced back to the Greeks and Romans, and from medieval times, head-dresses \u2013 similar to Boleyn\u2019s \u2013 were used by women to tie long hair back. Until the 20th century, women did not commonly cut their hair, he says.</p> <p>The alice band we know today originates in John Tenniel\u2019s illustrations for 1871\u2019s Through the Looking Glass, in which Alice wears a ribbon to tie her hair back. Glenville says this image means the headband has always been seen as a \u201csimple and youthful style\u201d and in the 1920s they were worn, across the forehead, by the Bright Young Things. You could argue the Sloanes, attending parties such as the Rose Ball in their headbands and puffball dresses, were picking up on the history of those hedonistic rich kids. \u201cThe original idea is about simplicity and practicality,\u201d says Glenville. \u201cThe ribbon holding long, luxuriant hair back.\u201d</p> <p>While there have been other headband moments since the 1980s (see Blair Waldorf in Gossip Girl), York says the trend is properly back now because \u2013 in common with most fashion revivals \u2013 enough time has passed between revivals, and we\u2019re able to see the charm of those 80s references. This is certainly true for Emma Elwick-Bates, contributing editor of American Vogue, and headband aficionado. \u201cTo me, the style recalls young Diana and Fergie, at ease and joyful,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd my perennial fashion favourite - Princess Caroline.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"edf5a97dd3ecd6a2d55794e4e5586e2d2612b4d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/edf5a97dd3ecd6a2d55794e4e5586e2d2612b4d5/0_0_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tamu McPherson and Anne Boleyn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tamu McPherson and Anne Boleyn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Getty Images &amp; Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet as York says: \u201cToffs don\u2019t dominate people\u2019s imagination in the way they [once] did.\u201d Indeed, a survey of current celebrity culture finds several headband wearers who like me, probably don\u2019t have Ascot on their yearly calendar. The US model Chrissy Teigen, for instance, has made HOTD \u2013 headband of the day \u2013 happen on her Instagram Stories since 2018. Zendaya \u2013 a hair icon for me as Rue in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria_(American_TV_series)\" title=\"\">Euphoria</a> \u2013 wore one to the Met Ball in May.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3b280d70c43deee0b03791a0efcbffa4fd61010c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b280d70c43deee0b03791a0efcbffa4fd61010c/772_385_2664_2174/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Diana, Princess of Wales.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"816\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Diana, Princess of Wales.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Princess Diana Archive/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And they are big with influencers who are \u2013 in theory at least \u2013 a meritocratic breed (the merit being based on your ability to look nonchalant while wearing a catwalk-fresh outfit and posing in the middle of a road). <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/pernilleteisbaek/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Pernille Teisbaek</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tamumcpherson/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Tamu McPherson</a> and Veronika Heilbrunner all wear headbands, as does Camila Carril, who has 146,000 followers, and excellent standing-in-the-road skills. Carril pre-ordered the pink Prada headband from the SS19 collection, and it is still a favourite. She says they provide a finishing touch: \u201cThe other day I was going for dinner and I wore a gorgeous, floral Zimmerman dress,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was pretty on its own, [but] I felt the need to have an accessory to complement it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"34e96df64dc089d1c259fe70ea907dbfbcd9fa6a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/34e96df64dc089d1c259fe70ea907dbfbcd9fa6a/0_0_5766_3461/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Camila Carril street style.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Camila Carril street style.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Saira MacLeod/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s this idea that could make headbands work for people like me, who are a bit allergic to dressing up. In theory, could I do my bit for sustainability by recycling an old outfit and adding a headband (which I could also <a href=\"https://www.ebay.co.uk/b/Womens-Headbands/45220/bn_1525863?rt=nc&amp;LH_ItemCondition=3000\" title=\"\">buy second-hand</a>)? And would it mean I had \u201cA Look\u201d despite minimal effort? Elwick-Bates bought a Prada padded band last year, and she says it has become central to her wardrobe. \u201cIt [the Prada headband] rang in the new year, but came into its own in Richard Curtis season come May,\u201d she says. \u201cSeveral weddings later, I still love it.\u201d</p> <p>Whether it is through sheer laziness or a way to be more Teigen, I\u2019m starting to think the headband could be reclaimed beyond those who appear in Debrett\u2019s. I\u2019m going to give it a try this party season. If you see me on the tube, try not to laugh.</p>",

Zendaya \u2013 a hair icon for me as Rue in Euphoria \u2013 wore one to the Met Ball in May. And they are big with influencers who are \u2013 in theory at least \u2013 a meritocratic breed (the merit being based on your ability to look nonchalant while wearing a catwalk-fresh outfit and posing in the middle of a road). Pernille Teisbaek, Tamu McPherson and Veronika Heilbrunner all wear headbands, as does Camila Carril, who has 146,000 followers, and excellent standing-in-the-road skills. Carril pre-ordered the pink Prada headband from the SS19 collection, and it is still a favourite. She says they provide a finishing touch: \u201cThe other day I was going for dinner and I wore a gorgeous, floral Zimmerman dress,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was pretty on its own, [but] I felt the need to have an accessory to complement it.\u201d It\u2019s this idea that could make headbands work for people like me, who are a bit allergic to dressing up. In theory, could I do my bit for sustainability by recycling an old outfit and adding a headband (which I could also buy second-hand)? And would it mean I had \u201cA Look\u201d despite minimal effort? Elwick-Bates bought a Prada padded band last year, and she says it has become central to her wardrobe. \u201cIt [the Prada headband] rang in the new year, but came into its own in Richard Curtis season come May,\u201d she says. \u201cSeveral weddings later, I still love it.\u201d Whether it is through sheer laziness or a way to be more Teigen, I\u2019m starting to think the headband could be reclaimed beyond those who appear in Debrett\u2019s. I\u2019m going to give it a try this party season. If you see me on the tube, try not to laugh.",

Maybe that idea has gone under the cardboard bus as well as Boris. I, for one, cannot stand more months of this pissing about. It\u2019s affecting my mental health, and probably [that of] many others in the country. Call a second referendum and scrap this bill. How can any of this possibly be better than where we are now?

The EU looks [prepared] to grant the extension now because there will be nothing to stop the vote of no confidence and a GE [general election]. The outcome of that is obviously uncertain, but in this situation, risks have to be taken to try to avert catastrophe. <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/134651103\">PowerlessAngryVictim</a></strong></p> \n<h2>\u2018It\u2019s wrong on so many levels\u2019</h2> \n<p>Cannot believe that 19 Labour MPs voted for Boris\u2019s deal and didn\u2019t vote for Theresa\u2019s deal, which did legally protect workers. It\u2019s wrong on so many levels. <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/134650986\">ADH1969</a></strong></p> \n<h2>\u2018As a voter you would have no idea what you would be getting by voting Labour\u2019</h2> \n<p>It is noble of Labour to say they respect diversity of opinion and Labour MPs can vote as they like, but what is the voter supposed to think about all this? If you stand for anything and everything, you stand for nothing. And you will get nothing done as a consequence. Labour should at the very least try to agree on the basics \u2013 do they support a referendum on the deal, do they support workers\u2019 rights, do they support the environment, do they stand up for job creation and social equality, etc. Once you agree on the principles, it should be easy to vote on the content of the bill. You know what you stand for and you check the bill if it is aligned to that. Alas, Labour is all over the place and hence a complete chaos. As a voter, you would have no idea what you would be getting by voting Labour. <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/134650760\">curiosity19</a></strong></p> \n<h2>\u2018I now appreciate the wisdom of Scotland\u2019s court of session\u2019</h2> \n<p>I think I now fully appreciate the wisdom of Scotland\u2019s court of session in keeping that sword of Damocles dangling over Boris Johnson\u2019s head. <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/134651072\">SporadicWit</a></strong></p> \n<h2>\u2018Johnson has backed himself into his own corner\u2019</h2> \n<p>Boris Johnson has backed himself into his own corner with all his ridiculous rhetoric. If he were a proper adult rather than a five-year-old in adult clothes, he would simply allow enough time for proper debate about his deal. Why is that such a problem? He might have to accept a few amendments, but that happens to every government. He has just made error after error since becoming PM. It\u2019s not clever to get rid of 21 [members] of your party. And as for the ERG [European Research Group] complaining about MPs voting against the government \u2013 the pot calling the kettle black \u2013 we wouldn\u2019t be in this situation if they had voted for Theresa May\u2019s deal. <strong><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13690375\">barriecooper</a></strong></p> \n<h2>\u2018Overall a good night for Labour\u2019</h2> \n<p>Don\u2019t worry about Labour MPs voting against the whip. It was only the second reading. These MPs can now demonstrate that they supported their constituents. If it does progress, judge them on their efforts to make amendments and their votes on the third reading \u2013 if it happens. Overall, a good night for Labour, Bonzo [Johnson] delayed his own Brexit bill and [Lisa] Nandy, [Dan] Jarvis et al now have the freedom to support amendments. Suck that one up, [Dominic] Cummings. <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/134650829\">YorksTyke</a></strong></p> \n<h2>\u2018This is rapidly disappearing up its own backside\u2019</h2> \n<p>As someone who has followed this keenly over the past few years, I don\u2019t feel much shame in admitting I\u2019ve found many elements of the past few days confusing. Not so much the procedures, but trying to understand tactics on all sides. I\u2019m convinced a general election will give another hung parliament. In turn, that gives little chance of agreement, a second referendum or revocation. Just more delay. This is rapidly disappearing up its own backside. <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/134650237\">DrDestruction</a></strong></p>",

Maybe that idea has gone under the cardboard bus as well as Boris. I, for one, cannot stand more months of this pissing about. It\u2019s affecting my mental health, and probably [that of] many others in the country. Call a second referendum and scrap this bill. How can any of this possibly be better than where we are now? The government has proposed no financial, economic and wellbeing benefits for leaving the EU in this state. AnotherAlan \u2018Risks have to be taken to try to avert catastrophe\u2019 This may seal Boris\u2019s fate. The EU looks [prepared] to grant the extension now because there will be nothing to stop the vote of no confidence and a GE [general election]. The outcome of that is obviously uncertain, but in this situation, risks have to be taken to try to avert catastrophe. PowerlessAngryVictim \u2018It\u2019s wrong on so many levels\u2019 Cannot believe that 19 Labour MPs voted for Boris\u2019s deal and didn\u2019t vote for Theresa\u2019s deal, which did legally protect workers. It\u2019s wrong on so many levels. ADH1969 \u2018As a voter you would have no idea what you would be getting by voting Labour\u2019 It is noble of Labour to say they respect diversity of opinion and Labour MPs can vote as they like, but what is the voter supposed to think about all this? If you stand for anything and everything, you stand for nothing. And you will get nothing done as a consequence. Labour should at the very least try to agree on the basics \u2013 do they support a referendum on the deal, do they support workers\u2019 rights, do they support the environment, do they stand up for job creation and social equality, etc. Once you agree on the principles, it should be easy to vote on the content of the bill. You know what you stand for and you check the bill if it is aligned to that. Alas, Labour is all over the place and hence a complete chaos. As a voter, you would have no idea what you would be getting by voting Labour. curiosity19 \u2018I now appreciate the wisdom of Scotland\u2019s court of session\u2019 I think I now fully appreciate the wisdom of Scotland\u2019s court of session in keeping that sword of Damocles dangling over Boris Johnson\u2019s head. SporadicWit \u2018Johnson has backed himself into his own corner\u2019 Boris Johnson has backed himself into his own corner with all his ridiculous rhetoric. If he were a proper adult rather than a five-year-old in adult clothes, he would simply allow enough time for proper debate about his deal. Why is that such a problem? He might have to accept a few amendments, but that happens to every government. He has just made error after error since becoming PM. It\u2019s not clever to get rid of 21 [members] of your party. And as for the ERG [European Research Group] complaining about MPs voting against the government \u2013 the pot calling the kettle black \u2013 we wouldn\u2019t be in this situation if they had voted for Theresa May\u2019s deal. barriecooper \u2018Overall a good night for Labour\u2019 Don\u2019t worry about Labour MPs voting against the whip. It was only the second reading. These MPs can now demonstrate that they supported their constituents. If it does progress, judge them on their efforts to make amendments and their votes on the third reading \u2013 if it happens. Overall, a good night for Labour, Bonzo [Johnson] delayed his own Brexit bill and [Lisa] Nandy, [Dan] Jarvis et al now have the freedom to support amendments. Suck that one up, [Dominic] Cummings. YorksTyke \u2018This is rapidly disappearing up its own backside\u2019 As someone who has followed this keenly over the past few years, I don\u2019t feel much shame in admitting I\u2019ve found many elements of the past few days confusing. Not so much the procedures, but trying to understand tactics on all sides. I\u2019m convinced a general election will give another hung parliament. In turn, that gives little chance of agreement, a second referendum or revocation. Just more delay. This is rapidly disappearing up its own backside. DrDestruction",

The authority\u2019s annual report stated that a \u201csizeable proportion\u201d of residential care providers were making a loss and a number of smaller providers were seeking to leave the sector.

He\u2019s said so, again and again. Last week, in a <a href=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/10/mark-zuckerberg-stands-for-voice-and-free-expression/\">speech </a><a href=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/10/mark-zuckerberg-stands-for-voice-and-free-expression/\">at Georgetown University</a>, he defended the company\u2019s laissez-faire approach to political misinformation, saying: \u201cAs a principle, in a democracy, I believe people should decide what is credible, not tech companies. Of course there are exceptions, and even for politicians we don\u2019t allow content that incites violence or risks imminent harm \u2013 and of course we don\u2019t allow voter suppression.\u201d</p> <p>That same desire, to absent himself and his company from any responsibility to shepherd the democratic process, is also what lies behind Facebook\u2019s tortuous third-party factchecking programme, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/16/facebook-fake-news-system-problems-fact-checking\">introduced in 2016</a>. To wit: the company selects professional factchecking organisations, ranging from respected impartial nonprofits (<a href=\"https://fullfact.org/\">FullFact </a>in the UK, <a href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/\">FactCheck.org</a> in the US) to \u2026 others (Tucker Carlson\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/apr/17/facebook-teams-with-rightwing-daily-caller-in-factchecking-program\">Daily Caller</a>).</p> <p>It pays those nonprofits to focus some of their time and attention on viral posts on Facebook and Instagram. If they flag a specific post or claim as false, Facebook then marks it as such on its own sites, and makes unspecified tweaks to its undocumented algorithms to reduce how many people see the posts. On Monday, the company announced that it would also start hiding false pictures and videos behind a clickthrough link declaring them as incorrect, and warning users if the post they are about to share is untrue.</p> <p>All of which, three years after the programme was launched, adds up to a vaguely reasonable system to keep some of the clearest falsehoods from going mega-viral on Facebook\u2019s social networks. But the bizarre hoops the company has jumped through to achieve those ends have nothing to do with whether or not they are the best way to actually fight misinformation, and everything to do with Facebook\u2019s desire to be seen as a company that is powerless over the content it hosts.</p> <p>It\u2019s this same factchecking programme that Facebook recently exempted political candidates from, in a move that had the knock-on effect of explicitly allowing those candidates to lie in adverts on the site. Not content with tying itself to the mast, Facebook bound the factcheckers alongside it: it wasn\u2019t going to decide what was credible, but neither were they. Never mind that that\u2019s their job; Facebook needs to be seen to have its hands off politics.</p> <p>But Facebook\u2019s problem is that politics is always in its hands. There\u2019s a longstanding myth about the 1960 presidential election: that Richard Nixon came off better among voters who listened to the debates on radio, but that John F Kennedy won amongst those who watched on TV. The story goes that the shifting technological base of the US helped the eventual winner shore up his vote.</p> <p>Sixty years on, we have another shifting technological base. God help a candidate who comes off worse in vertical video, the format favoured by so many mobile apps. But not every change in the media environment is purely technological. Some are deliberate. Over the past few years, for instance, Facebook has artificially intervened in its timeline to boost video, then live video, then quality news, then posts from your friends.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"712167505c56b0a723b2d3c09987190e8b07229d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/712167505c56b0a723b2d3c09987190e8b07229d/0_138_3981_2389/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook and Instagram ads that appeared during the 2016 presidential campaign\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Facebook\u2019s problem is that politics is always in its hands.\u2019 Facebook and Instagram ads that appeared during the 2016 presidential campaign.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Elswick/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Suppose one of the presidential candidates in the 2020 election comes off better in livestreams, while the other looks more natural in slickly edited videos. What would Facebook do in response? Would it commit to boosting both types of content equally? Would it freeze its algorithm in place for six months? Or declare that it doesn\u2019t want to pick which candidate gets an advantage, so it\u2019s ditching videos altogether until after the election? Of course not. But if Facebook did decide to boost livestreams over the following period, it would be hard to escape the conclusion that, just like in 1960, the medium had defined the message.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/19/elizabeth-warren-facebook-break-up\">'Too much power': it's Warren v Facebook in a key 2020 battle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps that\u2019s too far-fetched. Suppose, instead, that one candidate was extremely good at wielding falsehoods for political gain, while another had built a reputation for their deep knowledge of arcane policy issues. What would we say, then, about a decision to crack down on misinformation in politics? Or, conversely, a decision to explicitly allow any and all falsehoods to gain the full weight of the viral machine?</p> <p>Facebook is like a giant who wanders into a busy town, then closes its eyes and declares that if it can\u2019t see where it\u2019s going, it\u2019s not their fault who gets crushed underfoot. Ultimately there\u2019s only two ways to stop it changing everything: keep it away entirely \u2013 or bring it down to size.</p> <p>\u2022 Alex Hern is the UK technology editor for the Guardian</p>",

To wit: the company selects professional factchecking organisations, ranging from respected impartial nonprofits (FullFact in the UK, FactCheck.org in the US) to \u2026 others (Tucker Carlson\u2019s Daily Caller). It pays those nonprofits to focus some of their time and attention on viral posts on Facebook and Instagram. If they flag a specific post or claim as false, Facebook then marks it as such on its own sites, and makes unspecified tweaks to its undocumented algorithms to reduce how many people see the posts. On Monday, the company announced that it would also start hiding false pictures and videos behind a clickthrough link declaring them as incorrect, and warning users if the post they are about to share is untrue. All of which, three years after the programme was launched, adds up to a vaguely reasonable system to keep some of the clearest falsehoods from going mega-viral on Facebook\u2019s social networks. But the bizarre hoops the company has jumped through to achieve those ends have nothing to do with whether or not they are the best way to actually fight misinformation, and everything to do with Facebook\u2019s desire to be seen as a company that is powerless over the content it hosts. It\u2019s this same factchecking programme that Facebook recently exempted political candidates from, in a move that had the knock-on effect of explicitly allowing those candidates to lie in adverts on the site. Not content with tying itself to the mast, Facebook bound the factcheckers alongside it: it wasn\u2019t going to decide what was credible, but neither were they. Never mind that that\u2019s their job; Facebook needs to be seen to have its hands off politics. But Facebook\u2019s problem is that politics is always in its hands. There\u2019s a longstanding myth about the 1960 presidential election: that Richard Nixon came off better among voters who listened to the debates on radio, but that John F Kennedy won amongst those who watched on TV. The story goes that the shifting technological base of the US helped the eventual winner shore up his vote. Sixty years on, we have another shifting technological base. God help a candidate who comes off worse in vertical video, the format favoured by so many mobile apps. But not every change in the media environment is purely technological. Some are deliberate. Over the past few years, for instance, Facebook has artificially intervened in its timeline to boost video, then live video, then quality news, then posts from your friends. Suppose one of the presidential candidates in the 2020 election comes off better in livestreams, while the other looks more natural in slickly edited videos. What would Facebook do in response? Would it commit to boosting both types of content equally? Would it freeze its algorithm in place for six months? Or declare that it doesn\u2019t want to pick which candidate gets an advantage, so it\u2019s ditching videos altogether until after the election? Of course not. But if Facebook did decide to boost livestreams over the following period, it would be hard to escape the conclusion that, just like in 1960, the medium had defined the message. Perhaps that\u2019s too far-fetched. Suppose, instead, that one candidate was extremely good at wielding falsehoods for political gain, while another had built a reputation for their deep knowledge of arcane policy issues. What would we say, then, about a decision to crack down on misinformation in politics? Or, conversely, a decision to explicitly allow any and all falsehoods to gain the full weight of the viral machine? Facebook is like a giant who wanders into a busy town, then closes its eyes and declares that if it can\u2019t see where it\u2019s going, it\u2019s not their fault who gets crushed underfoot. Ultimately there\u2019s only two ways to stop it changing everything: keep it away entirely \u2013 or bring it down to size. \u2022 Alex Hern is the UK technology editor for the Guardian",

We have to come up with a plan to get into their half.\u201d South Africa\u2019s back-row Francois Louw dismissed the odds being offered by bookmakers on Wales who have not lost a competitive match since February\u2019s Six Nations defeat to Ireland in Dublin. \u201cThey are there to make money,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no way we are taking Wales lightly. They have been playing consistently well for a number of years, won the [Six Nations] grand slam earlier this year and were top of the world rankings for a few hours or days. \u201cThey are a fantastic outfit, a highly organised, structured side in which players wholeheartedly believe in their systems. They have a very effective defence and while they had a close call against France in the quarter-final, they will take a lot from that. It is play-off rugby. Anything can happen.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The former prime minister of Tuvalu has said he was \u201cstunned\u201d by Scott Morrison\u2019s behaviour at the recent Pacific Islands Forum, which he thought communicated the view that Pacific leaders should \u201ctake the money \u2026 then shut up about climate change\u201d. Enele Sopoaga, speaking at the national conference of the Australian Council for International Development (Acfid) in Sydney on Wednesday, said Morrison\u2019s behaviour at the forum, which Tuvalu hosted in August, was \u201cdismissive\u201d of the concerns of the Pacific regarding the climate crisis. \u201cAs the PIF chairman I was stunned by the un-Pacific tenor and manner of the Australian prime minister to water down the wording of the communique and to limit the concerns about climate change, much against the concerns and the tears that were shed by the Pacific Island leaders,\u201d he said in his keynote address. \u201cI thought, perhaps too ambitiously, that hosting the 50th PIF in Tuvalu, my country, which is perhaps the most threatened atoll nation due to impacts of climate change, would secure genuine sympathy and loyal understanding on our Tuvalu plea calling for urgent and complete response to climate change. \u201cSadly, making money took precedence over saving lives in [small island developing states].\u201d Sopoaga made the comments as 120 Australian international development NGOs backed calls by Pacific leaders for Australia to cease thermal coal exports by 2030, to increase Australia\u2019s domestic climate ambition in line with the Paris agreement and to refrain from using Kyoto carryover credits to meet its goals under the Paris agreement. The resolution mirrors calls by leaders at the Pacific Island Forum in Tuvalu, which was riven with tensions after Australia refused to back calls to commit to not opening new coalmines and to take action to limit global warming to under 1.5C. Speaking to the Guardian after his speech, Sopoaga added that he was \u201cvery, very insulted and deeply angry\u201d at comments made by the Australian deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, in August, as the Pacific Island Forum was going on in Tuvalu, in which he said Pacific Island nations affected by the climate crisis would continue to survive due to Australian aid and \u201cbecause many of their workers come here to pick our fruit\u201d. McCormack made the comments at a business function in Wagga Wagga, adding that he got \u201cannoyed\u201d with Pacific Islanders \u201cpointing the finger at Australia\u201d over the climate crisis. Sopoaga called the comments, for which McCormack eventually offered a qualified apology, \u201ccondescending, irrational, disrespectful\u201d and \u201cunbecoming\u201d. While Sopoaga reserved most of his criticism for the deputy prime minister, he said he felt Morrison\u2019s behaviour during the forum communicated the same attitude to Pacific leaders and did serious reputational damage to Australia in the region. \u201cThe same sort of thinking was there, although he didn\u2019t express it openly. It\u2019s part of his thinking, governmental thinking: take the money, you should be thankful you\u2019ve got that $500m and have got jobs to come to Australia to work, you should be thankful about that, then shut up about climate change. \u201cI think that\u2019s the meaning of [McCormack\u2019s] remarks, as far as I can understand it. And as the leader of the most vulnerable member country, I was very, very insulted and deeply angry about that.\u201d Before the Pacific Islands Forum, Morrison announced the Australian government would give $500m over five years to the Pacific region for climate change adaptation and mitigation. Sopoaga said that while Pacific nations \u201cappreciate\u201d funding from Australia, he criticised the Australian government for the fact that the promised $500m came from Australia\u2019s existing aid budget and should not be seen by the Australian government as a way of stopping Pacific leaders from vocal advocacy on the climate crisis. \u201cThis funding is repackaged from the existing ODA [official development assistance] to the Pacific and other sectors.

If he is alive, there is nothing we can do.\u201d Brazilian journalist Amauri Gonzo is recalling the moment that he knew Jair Bolsonaro would be elected his country\u2019s president. The stabbing of the far-right candidate seemed to confirm the picture of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/brazil\">Brazil</a> that Bolsonaro had been painting to voters: lawless, unsafe, and in need of a leader unafraid to meet violence with violence. Just two months later, in protest at five years dogged by economic crisis, corruption scandals and political turmoil, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/28/jair-bolsonaro-wins-brazil-presidential-election\">Brazil chose</a> the openly racist, misogynistic, homophobic and anti-environmentalist former paratrooper as its leader. The underground musical community, which had come out in force against the extreme right candidate, was stunned. \u201cIt all went quiet,\u201d says Gonzo, \u201clike, \u2018Oh, what do we do now?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Brazilian music might bring to mind the warm breeze of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/01/bossa-nova-highest-culture-brazil\">bossa nova</a>, or a sound humid with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2018/feb/12/spirit-of-samba-the-best-of-rio-carnival-in-pictures\">the sweat of carnival</a>, but a group of loosely connected S\u00e3o Paulo artists are making much harsher music to reflect, and resist, the Bolsonaro era, underlining values of community and artistic freedom.</p> <p>It\u2019s worth mentioning first that the country\u2019s long history of resistance through music runs directly parallel to its past as a colony, a slave state and as a military dictatorship.

Encompassing poetry, art and music, it subversively critiqued the regime.

Samba, he says, was initially a way for his African ancestors to access the heritage from which they had been violently cut off. For him, the roots of Brazil\u2019s current trauma date back just as far, to conquest, genocide and slavery. \u201cThe way we deal with what identity is and what culture is, is really fragmented.

But they prefer to avoid the kind of political anachronisms associated with punk. \u201cWe are not interested in cultivating nihilism \u2026 in cultivating crisis,\u201d he says, explaining that Deafkids\u2019 philosophy is not rooted in opposition. \u201cWe are more interested in trying to think of other ways to say yes, of other things and other practices to embrace and other ideas to spread.\u201d</p> <p>What this means in practice, he says, is bringing back communality to music. He has in mind everything from <em>cumbia</em> and classical Indian music to the radical techno of Underground Resistance, music that has been \u201cshunned as music which is not deep because it is related to the body\u201d. Deafkids, he says, want to engage with the body from the neck down, to make music that is \u201cmore transcendental in a less rational way\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"be94c6a23beb9237e5fb708a5c1ff88323fc4d78\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be94c6a23beb9237e5fb708a5c1ff88323fc4d78/0_0_3686_3686/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018It has never been easy to live in Brazil\u2019 \u2026 Rakta.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It has never been easy to live in Brazil\u2019 \u2026 Rakta.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andr\u00e9 Penteado</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The body itself is at the centre of post-punk group <a href=\"https://youtu.be/t5fweycpVCA\">Rakta</a>\u2019s work. \u201cBeing a woman and occupying a space in the Brazilian music scene is a social and political act in and of itself,\u201d says member Paula Rebellato, adding that, in Brazil, a woman is murdered every two hours. For them, Bolsonaro, who opposes gender equality and once taunted a female congresswoman that she was \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/23/maria-do-rosario-jair-bolsonaro-brazil-rape\">unworthy of rape</a>\u201d, is an open manifestation of Brazil\u2019s history of misogyny. \u201cIt has never been easy to live in Brazil,\u201d bandmate Carla Boregas adds poignantly, but now, because of Bolsanaro and others like him, people no longer bother to hide their misogyny, racism, homophobia \u201cand a host of other prejudices\u201d.</p> <p>Inspired by the attitude and the activism of the Brazilian hardcore scene of the late 80s and 90s, Rakta refract their experiences of growing up in Latin America\u2019s largest city through droning psychedelia. Boregas says that lyrics by 90s hardcore group Invasores de Cerebros (\u201cS\u00e3o Paulo dangerous city \u2026 S\u00e3o Paulo violent city\u201d) spoke directly to her experiences growing up in a working-class neighbourhood bordered by favelas. Their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/series/sao-paulo-live\">S\u00e3o Paulo is a city of enormous disparities</a>, a \u201cchaotic and vibrating\u201d place where you can experience the \u201ccomplete raw and hard duality of being a human in a capitalist society\u201d, she says.</p> <p>Similarly to Deafkids, with whom they toured this spring, unity is at the heart of their music, present in the \u201cstrong, intimidating, powerful and mysterious\u201d energy that comes from the female \u201cegregore\u201d (collective mind) of the group. Through their performances, which they describe as \u201ctemporary zones of reality that we co-create\u201d with the audience, Rakta want to create islands of sound in a sea of oppression, where \u201cpeople end up finding a little comfort, and feel hosted and integrated\u201d, says Boregas. The band may not be able to heal literal wounds, but they still have the artistic freedom with which they can ease some of the anxiety and distress that comes with daily life in Brazil under Bolsonaro.</p> <p>The idea of community as a small breach in an oppressive reality is also at the centre of S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s underground club culture. Around 2010, a new kind of party began to appear: self-organised, self-financed and inclusive. Often held in the street or in occupied buildings, they represent what Amauri Gonzo calls the proud Brazilian countercultural tradition of the street as both a party and a political venue.</p> <p>\u201cEverything was born out of a necessity to fill a blank spot in the culture of our city,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVcxNl9xftE\">Amanda Mussi</a>, a techno DJ and promoter. But successive mayoral administrations, seeking to clean up the downtown area, have made this harder, applying increasingly arcane and demanding safety regulations that these promoters say are not even met by S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s more upmarket, commercial clubs. Beyond that, there\u2019s endemic systemic corruption. \u201cIt\u2019s not just one permit,\u201d says Mussi. \u201cIt\u2019s a permit of a permit of a permit. You have to pay several charges and taxes, but this all goes to someone\u2019s pocket \u2013 it\u2019s not real.\u201d The agenda of the mayor\u2019s office is clear for these collectives and activists: a revitalised downtown is simply too potentially profitable to be left in the hands of community organisers. Now that the inner city has life again, it won\u2019t be long before the cycle of gentrification reaches its next step, with property developers moving in to create manicured, homogenised neighbourhoods.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"36ada9df3a60969224e0b46c5a41b275d594d9b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/36ada9df3a60969224e0b46c5a41b275d594d9b2/0_889_1365_963/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Playful activism \u2026 Teto Preto performing in 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"705\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Playful activism \u2026 Teto Preto performing in 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jesse Hunniford</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019re an open wound downtown,\u201d says Laura Diaz, a colleague of Mussi, and co-founder of the <a href=\"https://boilerroom.tv/article/contemporary-scenes-mamba-negra\">Mamba Negra</a> collective, S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s most renowned underground party. The roots of the collective, like many of those active today, can be found in the aftermath of the 2013 S\u00e3o Paulo protests. Initially sparked by an increase in transport fares, the demonstrations would culminate in 1m people taking to the street to protest against corruption, police brutality and a long list of other grievances. These protests demonstrated Brazil\u2019s disenchantment not just with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workers%27_Party_(Brazil)\">the ruling leftwing PT</a>, but the political class in general. With the sting of teargas still in the air, Diaz, a former student activist, met Carol Schutzer (who DJs as Cashu) and with the help of friends and collaborators, the two set about creating a party in their own image: \u201ca naughty, venomous snake\u201d.</p> <p>That image is perhaps best represented by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbPmnFaNgCE\">Teto Preto</a>, the electronic act fronted by Diaz and sinewy performance artist Lo\u00efc Koutana, who merge playfulness with activism: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0XzDN-Gv3A\">the video to their signature track Gasolina</a> features Koutana writhing and weaving along a line of police in riot gear, a call to ignite the fuel in the hearts and minds of their fellow Brazilians. Both Teto Preto and Mamba Negra are a re-vindication of the spirit of Brazil\u2019s week-long Carnaval street parties: joyously anarchic and riotously flamboyant.</p> <p>But it\u2019s about more than just dancing. Diaz says the aim was not only to create a safe space where women and LGBTQ people could party, but also where they can become protagonists who are recognised for their work. \u201cWe pay our taxes, we want to be respected, we want the right to work and the means to do it,\u201d she says. The ambition behind that statement burns especially brightly in a place where homophobia was criminalised only in May this year, a move swiftly denounced as \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d by Bolsonaro.</p> <p>That Mamba Negra and the Bolsonaro presidency were both born out of the smoke and anger of the 2013 protests demonstrates the division at the heart of Brazil. Out of that moment, each saw an opportunity: one side detected the potential for a Brazil that celebrates the country\u2019s diversity, and the other side saw the opportunity to use the chaos to drag the country back to its colonial divisions. That they still haven\u2019t escaped that colonial legacy is an issue that haunts these artists and their peers. But, equally, what keeps them from succumbing to the inevitability of that outcome is also written into Brazil\u2019s history: their faith in the unbreakable bonds of autonomous communities.

It\u2019s worth mentioning first that the country\u2019s long history of resistance through music runs directly parallel to its past as a colony, a slave state and as a military dictatorship. The 1964\u201385 dictatorship, for which Bolsonaro has openly professed his admiration, inspired Brazil\u2019s most famous moment of artistic resistance: the Tropic\u00e1lia movement. Encompassing poetry, art and music, it subversively critiqued the regime. The movement was already effectively over when in 1969 its musical leaders, Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil, were arrested as part of a crackdown and sent into a three-year exile in London. Less well known, but perhaps just as influential, are the hardcore and post-punk movements that swirled up in the early 80s as the dictatorship teetered and fell.

      "body": "<p>In the late 17th century, the cheese of Suffolk had a terrible reputation. Suffolk bang was said to have a meagre flavour and was so rock hard \u2013 \u201charder than the devil\u201d \u2013 that it needed to be warmed up to become vaguely edible. This disappointing foodstuff was known as a \u201cflotten\u201d cheese because it was made from skimmed milk. But the cheesemakers of the county insisted that it wasn\u2019t their fault their cheese, once highly regarded, had \u201cgrown into disrepute\u201d. In 1690, they wrote a petition to parliament complaining that the cheesemongers of London had forced them to skim ever more cream off their milk to make butter, the result being that Suffolk\u2019s cheeses had become \u201conly fit for slaves\u201d.</p> <p>As this story illustrates, cheese in Britain has always been up and down. At the moment, happily, it is up, argues Ned Palmer, a former jazz pianist turned cheesemonger, in this delightful and informative romp through centuries of British cheesemaking.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The war not only wiped out some of our cheese but changed the very nature of those that survived</p> <footer> <cite>Ned Palmer</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Palmer suggests that the long history of cheese in Britain is not one of simple decline or progress but of cycles of excellence followed by periods of compromise and disappointment. The 15th century, for example, seems to have been a golden era for British cheese, when hard, Parmesan-like cheeses were sold in foreign markets on the back of the wool trade. An Italian expert wrote that Britain\u2019s rich pastures made the country\u2019s cheeses excellent and abundant. Some of those sold in late medieval England included nettle (equivalent to Cornish Yarg today), cream cheese, morning milk cheese (similar to single gloucester) and angelot cheese, a reblochon-style creation made from the very creamiest milk. Yet a few centuries later, with industrialisation, the abundance and diversity were waning. In November 1935, TS Eliot wrote a letter to the Times suggesting that good British cheese, from Stilton to \u201cnoble old cheshire\u201d, was on the brink of extinction.</p> <p>Now, according to Palmer, we are once again in an era of miraculous resurgence for British cheese. In the UK, there are perhaps 700 varieties, \u201cfrom soft cheeses like the fresh and delicate goat\u2019s milk Perroche to full-on, funky washed-rinds like the aptly named Renegade Monk\u201d. The fact that this is so is largely due to two generations of inventive British cheesemakers and sellers including the late <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/13/mary-holbrook-goat-cheese-somerset-tymsboro\" title=\"\">Mary Holbrook</a>, creator of the lovely Tymsboro, which Palmer describes as \u201ca salty-peppery ash-covered pyramid\u201d made from goat\u2019s milk. Palmer\u2019s sensuous descriptions made me ravenous for cheese, from buttery lancashires to nutty Lincolnshire Poacher, a relatively recent British invention that occasionally tastes of pineapple. \u201cNobody knows why,\u201d he writes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5053d09afa949a1401db04286680519294772f6b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5053d09afa949a1401db04286680519294772f6b/0_581_3400_4432/767.jpg\" alt=\"Nettle cheese \u2026 Cornish Yarg.\" width=\"767\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nettle cheese \u2026 Cornish Yarg.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Food and Drink Photos/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The return of good British cheese is a surprise, given that for most of the 20th century, it looked as much of a dying commodity as shoes hand-stitched by cobblers. Palmer notes that in 1939 there were 333 British farms producing cheddar. By 1974, 300 of these farms had been lost and many of those that remained produced cheddars lacking the old character. The problems of British cheese were partly the problems of late 20th century food in general. Too much of it was mass-produced, globalised and dull. Factory cheese started being produced in the UK in the 1870s, but increasingly it could not compete with cheap imports from Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands. By 1929, New Zealand cheddar was \u201cfourpence a pound cheaper than its British farmhouse equivalent\u201d. In the 1930s, most British dairies switched from cheese production to liquid milk, which, strangely, gave bigger profits than butter or cheese. In 1933 the Milk Marketing Board was founded, whose mission was to stabilise the milk price rather than to protect cheese.</p> <p>British cheese took a further hit during the second world war. Food historians sometimes note that in terms of pure nutrition, the British never ate as well on average as they did under wartime rationing, when the Ministry of Food ensured an adequate diet for all. True, but rationing was a disaster for cheese. Under the cheese ration, most civilians had an ounce per person (with an extra 3 oz if you were vegetarian). This favoured block cheeses that could be easily cut into tiny cubes, and militated against anything too creamy or crumbly. Government-approved cheeses during the war included cheddar, cheshire, dunlop, lancashire, leicester and derby, but in reality, whichever cheese you asked for, what you got was a chunk of nondescript mousetrap, and you were grateful for it. This legacy of mediocre cheese continued long after the war had ended. As Palmer writes: \u201cBy pruning cheese varieties and blurring the distinctions between them, the war not only wiped out some of our cheese but changed the very nature of those that survived.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/apr/19/whats-the-best-way-to-store-cheese\">What\u2019s the best way to store cheese? | Kitchen Aide</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For decades after the war, British cheese had a very low reputation compared with that of France or Italy. This only started to change during the period that Palmer calls \u201cthe great cheese renaissance of the 1980s\u201d. In 1976, in a \u201crat-infested derelict bit of Covent Garden called Neal\u2019s Yard\u201d, entrepreneur Nicholas Saunders opened a warehouse selling wholefoods. After a few years, he added a cheese shop, which was managed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/may/01/how-randolph-hodgson-and-neals-yard-dairy-gave-cheese-a-chance\" title=\"\">Randolph Hodgson</a>. At first, Hodgson found he didn\u2019t have much to sell, so he set off on a quest through Britain and Ireland, tracking down anyone who was still making farmhouse cheeses and encouraging others to start.</p> <p>Almost all of the great cheeses of modern Britain have some connection with Randolph Hodgson and Neal\u2019s Yard Dairy. One of Palmer\u2019s favourites is Gorwydd Caerphilly, whose grey rind ripens the cheese \u201cfrom the outside in, breaking its firm dry texture down into something almost liquid and softening the bright citric acidity of the young cheese into a rich, cabbage creaminess\u201d. This cheese \u2013 so much more pleasing than a factory Caerphilly \u2013 was the creation of Todd Trethowan in the 1990s. Trethowan was planning to start a degree in archaeology when he happened to pass Neal\u2019s Yard Dairy and had what Palmer calls a \u201ccheese epiphany\u201d. This book \u2013 which would make a fine Christmas present, along with a wedge of Sparkenhoe red leicester \u2013 is full of such cheese epiphanies. A critic might argue that in paying so much attention to artisans, Palmer is glossing over the fact that the average cheese-eater in Britain is still eating dull block cheddars. But I was cheered by his passion. In this world of grief and division, it is heartwarming to be reminded that not everything is getting worse. These days, they are even making good cheeses in Suffolk: the mushroomy baron bigod, made near Bungay. \u201cUnlike the old Suffolk bang,\u201d Palmer observes, \u201cthis is not a cheese you could sharpen knives on.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 A Cheesemonger\u2019s History of the British Isles by Ned Palmer is published by Profile (RRP \u00a316.99) To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com or call 0330 333 6846.

There was no history or assessment to suggest the man was high-risk.</p> <p>The AHRC expressed serious concern over the use of restraints on a man with a mental illness and no history of aggressiveness, and on two people in wheelchairs.</p> <p>The report also found cases of officers turning off their bodyworn cameras during incidents.</p> <p>The AHRC president, Prof Rosalind Croucher, said any use of force in such a setting had to be appropriately justified.</p> <p>\u201cThe particular environment of immigration detention means that the use of force may occasionally be necessary,\u201d she wrote.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, the use of force on detainees directly engages their rights. In particular, people who are deprived of their liberty have the right to be treated with humanity and with respect for their inherent dignity.\u201d</p> <p>Several of the complaints related to an operation to move 19 families from Darwin\u2019s Wickham Point detention centre to Melbourne in April 2015, the day after a detainee protest.</p> <p>The transfers were without notice because, the department said, \u201coperational security requirements \u2026 over[rode] detainee notification requirements\u201d.</p> <p>Among the cases, the AHRC found that Emergency Response Team (ERT) officers made a \u201csignificant breach\u201d of the privacy rights of a 19-year-old woman, referred to as Ms KG.</p> <p>\u201cAt least four masked ERT officers entered the bedroom of Ms KG, then aged 19, unannounced before dawn and refused her the opportunity to get dressed without them being present,\u201d the report said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>She said that they did not speak to her, and motioned to her not to speak. She said that she was only wearing a nightdress and asked if she could put on some clothes for modesty. She said that the ERT officers indicated that she could put on clothes but that she had to leave her bathroom door open while doing so. She said that they did not leave her room while she was dressing and that she put on clothes over her nightdress in front of the officers. Ms KG alleged that this experience was humiliating, culturally inappropriate and insensitive, and that it invaded her privacy.</p> </blockquote> <p>The AHRC reviewed CCTV footage and confirmed at least four officers, wearing balaclavas, body armour and helmets, entered the woman\u2019s room.</p> <p>In its response to the AHRC the department said it was necessary to make Ms KG keep her door open while dressing so she didn\u2019t lock herself in or commit self-harm.

      "bodyText": "A 19-year-old woman who was forced to dress in the presence of masked male guards, and a mother who was separated from her newborn daughter for 32 hours and denied access to a lawyer are among a number of human rights breaches in onshore detention. A new report by the Australian Human Rights Commission, on the use of force in immigration detention, has called for a public inquiry, and recommended compensation be paid in multiple cases for unjustifiable use of force. The commission investigated 14 separate complaints and found nine cases breached international human rights law. It examined complaints about the use of metal cuffs, including on someone with a \u201csignificant wrist wound\u201d for more than eight hours; flexi cuffs, including on a 17-year-old boy; and dawn transfers of children, including a seven-year-old. It also noted the handcuffing of a man for 12 hours of flying between detention centres, which the department\u2019s response suggested was because \u2013 at least in part \u2013 he was Vietnamese and the department believed they were more likely to abscond. There was no history or assessment to suggest the man was high-risk. The AHRC expressed serious concern over the use of restraints on a man with a mental illness and no history of aggressiveness, and on two people in wheelchairs. The report also found cases of officers turning off their bodyworn cameras during incidents. The AHRC president, Prof Rosalind Croucher, said any use of force in such a setting had to be appropriately justified. \u201cThe particular environment of immigration detention means that the use of force may occasionally be necessary,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHowever, the use of force on detainees directly engages their rights. In particular, people who are deprived of their liberty have the right to be treated with humanity and with respect for their inherent dignity.\u201d Several of the complaints related to an operation to move 19 families from Darwin\u2019s Wickham Point detention centre to Melbourne in April 2015, the day after a detainee protest. The transfers were without notice because, the department said, \u201coperational security requirements \u2026 over[rode] detainee notification requirements\u201d. Among the cases, the AHRC found that Emergency Response Team (ERT) officers made a \u201csignificant breach\u201d of the privacy rights of a 19-year-old woman, referred to as Ms KG. \u201cAt least four masked ERT officers entered the bedroom of Ms KG, then aged 19, unannounced before dawn and refused her the opportunity to get dressed without them being present,\u201d the report said. She said that they did not speak to her, and motioned to her not to speak. She said that she was only wearing a nightdress and asked if she could put on some clothes for modesty. She said that the ERT officers indicated that she could put on clothes but that she had to leave her bathroom door open while doing so. She said that they did not leave her room while she was dressing and that she put on clothes over her nightdress in front of the officers. Ms KG alleged that this experience was humiliating, culturally inappropriate and insensitive, and that it invaded her privacy. The AHRC reviewed CCTV footage and confirmed at least four officers, wearing balaclavas, body armour and helmets, entered the woman\u2019s room. In its response to the AHRC the department said it was necessary to make Ms KG keep her door open while dressing so she didn\u2019t lock herself in or commit self-harm. The woman had been assessed as low-risk, including a low risk of becoming aggressive or engaging in self-harm. The AHRC said the Serco guards\u2019 actions were neither reasonable nor proportionate to a legitimate purpose and there were alternatives available, noting a female officer who was accompanying Ms KG\u2019s nine-year-old brother during the extraction could have gone in alone. The report examined the extraction of the whole family, who now live in community detention, noting that several members had been treated for PTSD symptoms, including recurrent and distressing memories and nightmares. During the same mass transfer of the Wickham Point families, guards also separated a young mother, referred to as Ms LC, from her newborn baby and husband, and handcuffed her for an hour and 40 minutes while she was taken to a police watchhouse. \u201cShe was not charged with any offence. Detainees were merely held at the watchhouse pending transfer to Melbourne the following day,\u201d the report said. \u201cMs LC was separated from her husband and baby for 32 hours. Ms LC asked to speak with a lawyer and this request was denied.\u201d The report said Ms LC was suffering postnatal depression at the time. The commissioner found the treatment breached her human right to be treated \u201cwith humanity and with respect for her human dignity\u201d, and breached the right of her baby \u201cnot to be separated from her mother\u201d. The AHRC recommended compensation be paid to eight parties, including the two women and their families, and an apology from the commonwealth to reflect the loss and damage suffered. The department said it did not accept that there was a meaningful prospect of legal liability in relation to the circumstances provided in the findings. The report made 24 recommendations, including changes to security risk assessments, the recording of use of force incidence, and reforms in the use of handcuffs and detainee transfers between centres. While the department accepted many, including an independent review of security risk assessment procedures, it rejected calls for a public inquiry, and defended others \u2013 such as prior notice of transfer to detainees \u2013 as already being part of policy. It accepted that families should not be separated during transfers, and agreed to have updated its policies by June of this year. \u201cThere needs to be effective oversight of the use of force in immigration detention,\u201d Croucher said. \u201cThis requires robust authorisation procedures, filming of all pre-planned uses of force in their entirety, and appropriate record keeping so that incidents can be properly assessed.\u201d \u201cToday\u2019s landmark report shows the frightening abuses of men, women and children who have sought safety and been detained by the Government in its detention centres,\u201d the Human Rights Law Centre\u2019s legal director, David Burke, said.",

      "bodyText": "Jacqui Lambie is set to pass the Coalition\u2019s union penalty bill despite John Setka\u2019s exit from the Labor party, after Anthony Albanese got his wish to remove the controversial unionist. On Wednesday \u2013 two days ahead of a national executive meeting to push him out of the party \u2013 Setka tendered his resignation. He also abandoned an appeal he had filed to contest the process initiated by Albanese, who alleged Setka had brought Labor into disrepute. Albanese declared the move a win for Labor values including respect for women, prompting Setka to issue a blistering statement attacking his leadership and attempting to link the decision to wider labour movement anger at Labor\u2019s position on the Indonesian free-trade agreement. A spokeswoman for Lambie confirmed to Guardian Australia that the senator\u2019s position remains that if Setka does not resign as Victorian secretary of the Construction Forestry Mining Maritime and Energy Union she will vote for the ensuring integrity bill. Given Centre Alliance\u2019s Rex Patrick has said he will not support the bill in its current form and is seeking amendments, Lambie\u2019s vote is critical to passing the bill which gives new powers to the federal court to make orders about the governance of unions and allows employers to request the deregistration or disqualification of union officials for breaches of industrial law. Albanese told reporters in Canberra that Setka\u2019s removal was important because it allowed Labor to demonstrate that \u201c[its] values as a party are greater than any individual and that we\u2019re prepared to stand up for those values\u201d. \u201cI think that this is a good outcome for the Australian Labor party that allows us to draw the line under these issues and to confront a government that attacks workers\u2019 rights, that doesn\u2019t stand up for working values,\u201d he said. Albanese said Labor believed in the right to collectively bargain and to \u201cdeal with the power imbalance that\u2019s there between individual workers and employers\u201d. \u201cI will stand up for the rights of trade unions, but I\u2019ll also lead a Labor party.\u201d In his statement, Setka said he \u201ccannot continue to be a member of the Labor party while Anthony Albanese is its leader\u201d. Setka accused Albanese of attempting to push him out \u201cbased on false allegations [motivated] by old-fashioned political payback\u201d after he decided his branch would stop financial contributions to Labor. Setka accused Albanese of \u201cturning his back on the values that underpin both the party and the union movement\u201d, citing the fact he had abandoned Bill Shorten\u2019s policy promises to \u201c[stand] up for a progressive tax system, properly [fund] education and [abolish] the undemocratic, anti-union Australian Building and Construction Commission\u201d. \u201cJust when I thought the Labor party couldn\u2019t betray its principles and workers any further, it sided with the Morrison government on new free-trade deals with Indonesia, Hong Kong and Peru.\u201d Setka accused Labor of having \u201cgone missing in action in the fight to stop the ensuring integrity bill\u201d. Albanese moved against Setka in June, citing comments denigrating the work of the anti-violence campaigner Rosie Batty \u2013 which Setka denies making \u2013 and later adding convictions for breaching a family violence intervention order and harassment as reasons for him to go. The Australian Council of Trade Unions and many of its affiliates supported calls for Setka to resign but Setka refuses to leave his union position \u2013 a fact that will not change despite his exit from Labor, unless he is blasted out by his own members.

More than 30 heath snails (Xerolenta obvia), which have never before been detected in Australia, were found by the Department of Agriculture in shipments of the luxury German car. Australian biosecurity officers have taken the emergency measure of sending all 900 affected cars back to Europe, the department announced on Wednesday. The exotic gastropods are a pest that eat wheat, barley and fruit trees, and carry a range of parasites and fungal diseases. \u201cIn excess of 30 snails have been found to date,\u201d the department said. \u201cHeath snail have also been shown to transmit spores of Alternaria sp, Fusarium sp, and spores of rust have been found in its faeces. \u201cThis species may also be infected by Protostrongylidae larvae that affect sheep and goats, including the exotic parasite Protostrongylus brevispiculum, Neostrongylus linearis, and potentially other Protostrongylidae species.\u201d All kinds of Mercedes-Benz, from cars to vans, are believed to be affected, and the snail infestation could delay the orders of Australian customers, Drive.com.au reported. The company told Drive it was \u201cworking closely with the Department of Agriculture\u201d and was investigating the cause. The snail-affected shipments were carried on five different vessels from Europe, and arrived in Melbourne, Brisbane, Fremantle in Western Australia and Port Kembla in New South Wales. \u201cThe heath snail is an exotic snail to Australia and populations are understood only to exist in south-eastern Europe and localised populations in Canada and the United States of America,\u201d a spokeswoman said. \u201cThe department has considered all known and approved treatment options to manage the risk onshore and determined that the most appropriate action is to export the vehicles from Australian territory.\u201d The heath snail is also considered a pest in Canada and the US. However, the department stressed that the snails discovered were not giant African snails, the mollusc that can grow up to 30cm and is also a pest in Australia. In October, the giant snails were found on a shipment from Vietnam that contained wind turbine parts. Ten shipments this year have been found to contain the snail.

Half of Kilo\u2019s regulars do big weekly shops in Digbeth, diligently bringing containers from home for refills, but Bournville has the potential to unlock little-and-often, packaging-free shopping for a wider demographic.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey won\u2019t have to bulk buy because it\u2019s only round the corner,\u201d says Wong. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a realistic option because they can walk.\u201d</p> \n<p>Pell agrees: \u201cIt\u2019ll probably be smaller basket spends there: \u2018I\u2019ve just run out of rice, I\u2019ll top this container up.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>This is of a piece with the duo\u2019s mission to turn zero-waste shopping from a niche activity into something more everyday. \u201cWe were one of the first zero-waste shops to move away from just dry goods,\u201d says Wong. \u201cWe put fruit and veg in, a deli counter and a freezer, because we wanted the shop to be a convenient, realistic way of shopping.\u201d </p> \n<p>That has meant seeking out packaging-free oils, butter, body lotion, yogurt, shampoo and even un-bagged crisps from Just Crisps in Staffordshire</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/oct/23/ofm-awards-2019-best-ethical-food-project-runners-up\">OFM Awards 2019: Best ethical food project \u2013 the runners-up</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Pricing is crucial, too. Stung by comparisons during filming for BBC One\u2019s <em>Eat Well For Less?</em> this summer, Pell and Wong reduced the cost of staples such as pasta and rice. Its non-homogenised milk from a small Shropshire farm is 99p a litre, similar to local convenience stores, while certain products, notably herbs and spices, are frequently cheaper than their equivalents. \u201cWe have limitations. We can\u2019t bulk buy and [75%] of our products are organic, but we want to be accessible,\u201d says Wong.</p> \n<p>Despite plastic-free innovations at some supermarkets, Pell suspects higher costs (staffing, supply-chain investment etc.) will make it harder for many to swiftly dispense with packaging. Stores such as Kilo might nudge them in the right direction \u2013 \u201cWe\u2019ve raised awareness,\u201d says Wong \u2013 but \u201cunique, authentic\u201d independents will remain in the green vanguard. Indeed, the Clean Kilo offers consultancy services to emerging zero-waste retailers. \u201cLook at the carrier bag charge,\u201d says Wong. \u201cCustomer habits can and have changed.\u201d <br><em><a href=\"https://www.thecleankilo.co.uk/\">thecleankilo.co.uk</a></em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2019/10/ofm-awards-label-2019-atom\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

      "bodyText": "OFM last met Jeanette Wong and Tom Pell in April and, since then, the owners of Birmingham zero-waste, plastic-free store the Clean Kilo have been busy. Customer numbers are up 33%, its range of 600 lines has doubled in the last year and, this month, OFM\u2019s 2019 Best Ethical Food Project will open a second site, in Bournville. Unlike the first Kilo in central Birmingham\u2019s Digbeth district, the Bournville site is densely residential. Half of Kilo\u2019s regulars do big weekly shops in Digbeth, diligently bringing containers from home for refills, but Bournville has the potential to unlock little-and-often, packaging-free shopping for a wider demographic. \u201cThey won\u2019t have to bulk buy because it\u2019s only round the corner,\u201d says Wong. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a realistic option because they can walk.\u201d Pell agrees: \u201cIt\u2019ll probably be smaller basket spends there: \u2018I\u2019ve just run out of rice, I\u2019ll top this container up.\u2019\u201d This is of a piece with the duo\u2019s mission to turn zero-waste shopping from a niche activity into something more everyday. \u201cWe were one of the first zero-waste shops to move away from just dry goods,\u201d says Wong. \u201cWe put fruit and veg in, a deli counter and a freezer, because we wanted the shop to be a convenient, realistic way of shopping.\u201d That has meant seeking out packaging-free oils, butter, body lotion, yogurt, shampoo and even un-bagged crisps from Just Crisps in Staffordshire Pricing is crucial, too. Stung by comparisons during filming for BBC One\u2019s Eat Well For Less? this summer, Pell and Wong reduced the cost of staples such as pasta and rice. Its non-homogenised milk from a small Shropshire farm is 99p a litre, similar to local convenience stores, while certain products, notably herbs and spices, are frequently cheaper than their equivalents. \u201cWe have limitations. We can\u2019t bulk buy and [75%] of our products are organic, but we want to be accessible,\u201d says Wong. Despite plastic-free innovations at some supermarkets, Pell suspects higher costs (staffing, supply-chain investment etc.) will make it harder for many to swiftly dispense with packaging. Stores such as Kilo might nudge them in the right direction \u2013 \u201cWe\u2019ve raised awareness,\u201d says Wong \u2013 but \u201cunique, authentic\u201d independents will remain in the green vanguard. Indeed, the Clean Kilo offers consultancy services to emerging zero-waste retailers. \u201cLook at the carrier bag charge,\u201d says Wong. \u201cCustomer habits can and have changed.\u201d thecleankilo.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>When Apple launched its smartwatch in 2015 to a lukewarm reception, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/23/will-apple-be-the-smartwatch-saviour\">some critics claimed</a> it would never take off like the iPod or iPhone. But sales of the Apple Watch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/28/apple-watch-smartwatch-sales-analysis\">quickly eclipsed</a> every other smartwatch and with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/05/apple-finds-wearables-count-iphone-sales-slip\">wearable technology sales soaring</a> it is expected this year to outsell all of the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/29/fashion/smartwatches-apple-tag-heuer.html\">Swiss watchmakers combined</a>.</p> <p>The latest Apple Watch Series 5 iteration, though still pricey at \u00a3399 and up, looks likely to continue the firm\u2019s domination of the smartwatch market and deservedly so.</p> <p>If you are unfamiliar with Apple\u2019s smartwatches, they only work if you also have an Apple iPhone 6S or newer connecting to the smartphone via Bluetooth. It\u2019s a genius link-up that ties buyers into the Apple ecosphere, while adding an important alternative revenue stream as people hold onto their phones. But that doesn\u2019t take away from the extraordinary qualities of this watch.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"281303aaf9f6a36df3e32d200eed79784f901c60\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/281303aaf9f6a36df3e32d200eed79784f901c60/636_732_3578_2147/1000.jpg\" alt=\"apple watch series 5 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Each of the watch faces, such as the Numerals Duo shown here, now has a low-power version that displays when you\u2019re not actively using the watch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Series 5 builds on last year\u2019s larger-screen redesign of the Apple Watch, making one small but important change: the screen now stays on all the time.</p> <p>It\u2019s a feature every other smartwatch has had for years and is important for actually telling the time, which is absolutely essential for something to have a permanent place on my wrist.</p> <p>Until now Apple Watch owners had to either tap the face or do an elaborate wrist rotation gesture to get the screen to light up \u2013 and it never worked when I really needed it to, such as when running for a train. Now you can see the time at a glance at any time or angle. </p> <p>The rest of the Apple Watch has always been top notch. Equipped with the right strap \u2013 if you haven\u2019t tried the Sport Loop or one of its many clones you absolutely must \u2013 the Apple Watch is the most comfortable timepiece I\u2019ve had the pleasure of strapping to my wrist, beating some of the very best the Swiss watchmakers have to offer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1190ff699cda910ad84cb07dcb1d286a5ee483e5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1190ff699cda910ad84cb07dcb1d286a5ee483e5/721_558_3681_2209/1000.jpg\" alt=\"apple watch series 5 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Apple Watch is just over 1cm thick, but wears its depth well, fitting under most shirt cuffs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s neither heavy nor light, and hides the heart rate sensor in a curved lump on its belly comfortably sitting atop your wrist. It fits easily under shirt cuffs, which some larger smartwatches don\u2019t. It\u2019s water resistant to depths of 50m, which means you\u2019ll likely never have to worry about it when you take a dip in the pool.</p> <p>The screen is bright and crisp, clearly visible in all circumstances. I\u2019ve never been a massive fan of the rectangular shape, preferring my watches to be of the circular variety, but the Series 5 has won me round over the last month.</p> <p>Apple still leads the way on haptics \u2013 the little vibrations and taps the watch makes to let you know something has happened. I loved them with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/apr/28/apple-watch-review-smartwatch-iphone-taptic-siri\">original in 2015</a>, and they\u2019re still miles better than anything else on the market five generations later.</p> <h2>Victim of its own success</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24dc37fb2f7bf51b2e318cc84f92e804541f5569\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24dc37fb2f7bf51b2e318cc84f92e804541f5569/236_222_4160_2497/1000.jpg\" alt=\"apple watch series 5 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The digital crown, side button and the ability to press harder into the screen to activate functions augment simple taps and swipes on the touchscreen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One thing you might not appreciate until you strap one to your wrist is that there are so many of them out there in the wild, all looking the same. I\u2019m not one to conform to any particular fashion or club, so I often get that twinge of embarrassment you feel when you walk into a room and spot someone wearing the same shirt or dress.</p> <p>It\u2019s made a little better with the Series 5 now you can have the screen on all the time and pick a slightly different face, but by putting one on you instantly become one of the Apple Watch people.</p> <p>Apple provides loads of watch faces, which are all infinitely tweakable in colour, with many having dial customisation. Then there\u2019s a sizeable collection of widgets for things like timers, the weather, activity and others called \u201ccomplications\u201d. But I\u2019ve found there\u2019s always something not quite perfect about each face that I can\u2019t change. I love the new Numerals Duo face, but I wish it could have the date on it too. I really like the Meridian analogue face too, but wish it had an option for numerals not just ticks.</p> <p>I also find the round analogue faces hard to read at a glance even on the 44mm Series 5 because they\u2019re just bit too small. I\u2019m being picky here, but that\u2019s the thing about something you wear \u2013 if it\u2019s not quite how you want it you\u2019re going to notice it and be annoyed by it over and over.</p> <h2>Apps and things</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1c6cfb7c69ba1d4755459c599e5ae8405602338e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c6cfb7c69ba1d4755459c599e5ae8405602338e/559_389_4023_2414/1000.jpg\" alt=\"apple watch series 5 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">There\u2019s a calculator. It\u2019s a bit small, but will do in a pinch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of course the Apple Watch does more than just tell the time. </p> <p>Notifications are a high point. A little tap on the wrist and you know something has happened. Most you can interact with in some way. All of Apple\u2019s apps work well, of course, but so do third-party apps. The Nest and Ring apps show photos of events from cameras for instance.</p> <p>Messaging apps including Signal and WhatsApp can be marked as read or replied to straight from your wrist. You can dictate what you want to Siri, draw out letters one at a time or send canned responses or emojis.</p> <p>Most Apple Watch apps aren\u2019t up to much, but one that bucks the trend is the Spotify app, which gives you full control of playback on your iPhone from your wrist, including volume control using the digital crown. But it can\u2019t store music offline unlike the Apple Music app. </p> <h2>Apple Pay and Siri</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b60d400633e17d9f78ef9b9159db7a76fbb38e92\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b60d400633e17d9f78ef9b9159db7a76fbb38e92/770_603_3459_2076/1000.jpg\" alt=\"apple watch series 5 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Siri on the Apple Watch is unsurprisingly similar to Siri on the iPhone, with the same strengths and weaknesses.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Apple Pay on your wrist is great too. Double press the big side button to bring up the card and then just put it near the reader as you would a phone or contactless credit card.</p> <p>Siri is great when it works, but can be hamstrung by poor network conditions. </p> <p>\u201cHey, Siri\u201d works fine, but activates fairly often when I don\u2019t want it to, ditto for raising your wrist to speak to Siri. I deactivated both features and didn\u2019t miss them. Setting timers, reminders, alarms and other bits via Siri work great, but things start to fall apart with more complex tasks or questions. It\u2019s the same on an iPhone, more or less.</p> <p>There\u2019s no Google Maps app on the Apple Watch, which is disappointing. Apple Maps is getting better, but it\u2019s really not that great in the UK. Citymapper offers an Apple Watch app, which is certainly better for getting around London and other major cities.</p> <h1>Health</h1>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1bdc9f32c4a67f975a515eb6d8f9bbfa43458433\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1bdc9f32c4a67f975a515eb6d8f9bbfa43458433/501_363_3971_2383/1000.jpg\" alt=\"apple watch series 5 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Apple Watch is one of the best consumer heart trackers available.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Apple has slowly turned its smartwatch into one of the best multipurpose fitness trackers available. You name it, the Apple Watch can track or record it, apart from one glaring omission: sleep.</p> <p>The workout app has modes to track a huge list of activities and sports, from your usual running, walking, hiking, cycling and swimming to yoga, tai chi, dance, football, badminton, hockey, table tennis and even fishing.</p> <p>The Apple Watch automatically looks out for some workouts too. I get a notification to track an outdoor walk twice a day on my commute, which I found annoying enough to turn the feature off.</p> <p>For running the Apple Watch is surprisingly good, tracking everything a mid-range dedicated Garmin running watch would, including performance stats such as VO2 Max. It\u2019s got a long enough battery life with everything going to track a marathon, but I certainly feel it more as a lump on my wrist than my go-to Garmin Forerunner 235. There\u2019s a dedicated Strava app for the Apple Watch if that\u2019s your jam.</p> <p>Day-to-day health tracking is solid. The heart rate sensor measures your beats per minute throughout the day, logging it upwards of 12 times an hour or on-demand for you to view in the newly revitalised health app on your phone. But it can also notify you of abnormal heart rates, which are typically high when you\u2019re not doing anything.</p> <p>You can also manually take an electrocardiogram (ECG) by placing your finger on the crown for 30 seconds or so. The apps shows you the waveform in real time and notifies you if your heart beat <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208931\">looks irregular</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cfd3fa5528a530c94b0f80535abfc568a622c614\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cfd3fa5528a530c94b0f80535abfc568a622c614/649_527_3763_2258/1000.jpg\" alt=\"apple watch series 5 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The noise app helps you be aware of noisy environments that may permanently damage your hearing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other daily activity tracking takes the form of Apple\u2019s activity rings: move in calories, exercise in minutes and stand in hours, complete with nags to stand up each hour if you haven\u2019t already. Steps and distance are also recorded, along with flights of stairs climbed, and you get awards if you beat your goals. Exporting your activity is fairly restricted, but as all the data is stored in Apple Health you can connect to third-party apps.</p> <p>Included too are menstrual cycle tracking and fall detection. New for the Series 5 is the noise app, which monitors environmental noise and warns you if you\u2019re in conditions that could damage your health. It also measures headphone volume on the iPhone, which may be just as useful for those listening to music too loudly.</p> <h2>Battery life</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d76ddb3c0997cb3df21ae1a04c3f3175a0befb1c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d76ddb3c0997cb3df21ae1a04c3f3175a0befb1c/296_0_4372_2624/1000.jpg\" alt=\"apple watch series 5 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Series 5 uses the same magnetic wireless charging puck as the first generation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Battery life was the key worry for the Apple Watch with an always-on screen. Thankfully, I can report in day-to-day usage I was left with no less than 40% battery at the end of a day. It won\u2019t manage two 7am till 11pm days, but it won\u2019t fail you if you go for a run during the day or similar.</p> <p>An 18-minute, 4km run with GPS, heart rate monitoring, pace alerts and the screen always on consumed only 3% battery so marathons should be no bother.</p> <h2>Observations</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09e8a1a61675ea9f77d2d8383a4dcebb16933945\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09e8a1a61675ea9f77d2d8383a4dcebb16933945/479_118_4193_2517/1000.jpg\" alt=\"apple watch series 5 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Swapping out straps is super quick and easy with quick-release buttons on either side of the watch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>The default app view is still the old honeycomb matrix of apps, which is hard to use, but can be switched to an easier and faster simple list with a hard press</p></li> <li><p>Taking calls on your wrist is novel and works amazingly well, but embarrassing when people stare at you in public (which is similar to attempting to talk to Siri)</p></li> <li><p>4G is only useful if you happen to go out without your phone, so you can stay in touch seeing notifications, receiving messages and calls, or using maps if you\u2019re lost</p></li> </ul> <h2>Price</h2> <p>The Apple Watch Series 5 comes in two sizes, various different materials and models with the option of 4G.</p> <p>The aluminium or Nike versions are available with or without 4G.

But for the Series 5 that\u2019s changed. It\u2019s not just the best smartwatch for the iPhone. The Apple Watch is now a solid reason to buy an iPhone in the first place.</p> <p>The screen being on all the time that was the last piece in the Apple Watch puzzle. What started out as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/apr/28/apple-watch-review-smartwatch-iphone-taptic-siri\">a bit of a let down in 2015</a> has since been refined, sped up and had meaningful features added to it that make it far more than the sum of its parts.</p> <p>After five generations Apple has finally nailed it, but that\u2019s not to say the Series 5 is perfect. It would be great to have sleep tracking to close the circle on health tracking. It would be better if it lasted at least two days so you could go on a weekend away without bringing the charger.</p> <p>I wish there was a circular version too for variety, and it would be better for everyone if they didn\u2019t all look the same like some sort of clone army. Strap one of these to your wrist and you become part of a tribe: the Apple Watch wearers.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s the price. At \u00a3399 and up the Apple Watch Series 5 is in no way cheap. The Series 3 is still on sale from \u00a3199, but doesn\u2019t do it for me with that mostly-off screen. With the competition mostly coming in at under \u00a3300 the Series 5 has Apple\u2019s typical premium \u2013 but it\u2019s a premium anyone considering an Apple Watch has already paid for their iPhone.</p> <p>Simply put, the Apple Watch Series 5 is the best smartwatch you can buy right now. You might just need to also buy an iPhone to get it.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Pros:</strong> excellent haptics, always-on screen, ECG, great health tracking, great activity tracking, solid running watch, 50m water resistance, all-day battery life, offline music, loads of watch faces, quick-swap straps, comfortable, Apple Pay</p> <p><strong>Cons:</strong> expensive, only works with an iPhone, no sleep tracking, too popular</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cfb0968a1799bbe3b8e95124c4b8ad39addac175\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cfb0968a1799bbe3b8e95124c4b8ad39addac175/766_660_3551_2132/1000.jpg\" alt=\"apple watch series 5 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">You can alter lots of things on each watchface, but somehow they\u2019re never quite perfect.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Other reviews</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/01/iphone-11-review-iphone-xr-dual-camera-a13-smartphone\">iPhone 11 review: an iPhone XR with a better camera</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/07/iphone-11-pro-the-best-small-phone-available\">iPhone 11 Pro review: the best small phone available</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/09/iphone-11-pro-max-review-battery-camera-screen\">iPhone 11 Pro Max review: salvaged by epic battery life</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/14/sony-wf-1000xm3-review-updated-noise-cancelling-earbuds-sound-great\">Sony WF-1000XM3 review: updated noise-cancelling earbuds sound great</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/20/libratone-track-air-review-the-noise-cancelling-airpods-apple-wont-give-you\">Libratone Track Air+ review: the noise-cancelling AirPods Apple won\u2019t give you</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/08/bose-frames-review-smart-audio-sunglasses-are-a-blast\">Bose Frames review: smart audio sunglasses are a blast</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/01/best-true-wireless-earbuds-airpods-samsung-jabra-sennheiser-anker-compared-and-ranked\">Best true wireless earbuds 2019: AirPods, Samsung, Jabra, Beats and Anker compared and ranked</a></strong></p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "When Apple launched its smartwatch in 2015 to a lukewarm reception, some critics claimed it would never take off like the iPod or iPhone. But sales of the Apple Watch quickly eclipsed every other smartwatch and with wearable technology sales soaring it is expected this year to outsell all of the Swiss watchmakers combined. The latest Apple Watch Series 5 iteration, though still pricey at \u00a3399 and up, looks likely to continue the firm\u2019s domination of the smartwatch market and deservedly so. If you are unfamiliar with Apple\u2019s smartwatches, they only work if you also have an Apple iPhone 6S or newer connecting to the smartphone via Bluetooth. It\u2019s a genius link-up that ties buyers into the Apple ecosphere, while adding an important alternative revenue stream as people hold onto their phones. But that doesn\u2019t take away from the extraordinary qualities of this watch. The Series 5 builds on last year\u2019s larger-screen redesign of the Apple Watch, making one small but important change: the screen now stays on all the time. It\u2019s a feature every other smartwatch has had for years and is important for actually telling the time, which is absolutely essential for something to have a permanent place on my wrist. Until now Apple Watch owners had to either tap the face or do an elaborate wrist rotation gesture to get the screen to light up \u2013 and it never worked when I really needed it to, such as when running for a train. Now you can see the time at a glance at any time or angle. The rest of the Apple Watch has always been top notch. Equipped with the right strap \u2013 if you haven\u2019t tried the Sport Loop or one of its many clones you absolutely must \u2013 the Apple Watch is the most comfortable timepiece I\u2019ve had the pleasure of strapping to my wrist, beating some of the very best the Swiss watchmakers have to offer. It\u2019s neither heavy nor light, and hides the heart rate sensor in a curved lump on its belly comfortably sitting atop your wrist. It fits easily under shirt cuffs, which some larger smartwatches don\u2019t. It\u2019s water resistant to depths of 50m, which means you\u2019ll likely never have to worry about it when you take a dip in the pool. The screen is bright and crisp, clearly visible in all circumstances. I\u2019ve never been a massive fan of the rectangular shape, preferring my watches to be of the circular variety, but the Series 5 has won me round over the last month. Apple still leads the way on haptics \u2013 the little vibrations and taps the watch makes to let you know something has happened. I loved them with the original in 2015, and they\u2019re still miles better than anything else on the market five generations later. Victim of its own success One thing you might not appreciate until you strap one to your wrist is that there are so many of them out there in the wild, all looking the same. I\u2019m not one to conform to any particular fashion or club, so I often get that twinge of embarrassment you feel when you walk into a room and spot someone wearing the same shirt or dress. It\u2019s made a little better with the Series 5 now you can have the screen on all the time and pick a slightly different face, but by putting one on you instantly become one of the Apple Watch people. Apple provides loads of watch faces, which are all infinitely tweakable in colour, with many having dial customisation. Then there\u2019s a sizeable collection of widgets for things like timers, the weather, activity and others called \u201ccomplications\u201d. But I\u2019ve found there\u2019s always something not quite perfect about each face that I can\u2019t change. I love the new Numerals Duo face, but I wish it could have the date on it too. I really like the Meridian analogue face too, but wish it had an option for numerals not just ticks. I also find the round analogue faces hard to read at a glance even on the 44mm Series 5 because they\u2019re just bit too small. I\u2019m being picky here, but that\u2019s the thing about something you wear \u2013 if it\u2019s not quite how you want it you\u2019re going to notice it and be annoyed by it over and over. Apps and things Of course the Apple Watch does more than just tell the time. Notifications are a high point. A little tap on the wrist and you know something has happened. Most you can interact with in some way. All of Apple\u2019s apps work well, of course, but so do third-party apps. The Nest and Ring apps show photos of events from cameras for instance. Messaging apps including Signal and WhatsApp can be marked as read or replied to straight from your wrist. You can dictate what you want to Siri, draw out letters one at a time or send canned responses or emojis. Most Apple Watch apps aren\u2019t up to much, but one that bucks the trend is the Spotify app, which gives you full control of playback on your iPhone from your wrist, including volume control using the digital crown. But it can\u2019t store music offline unlike the Apple Music app. Apple Pay and Siri Apple Pay on your wrist is great too. Double press the big side button to bring up the card and then just put it near the reader as you would a phone or contactless credit card. Siri is great when it works, but can be hamstrung by poor network conditions. \u201cHey, Siri\u201d works fine, but activates fairly often when I don\u2019t want it to, ditto for raising your wrist to speak to Siri. I deactivated both features and didn\u2019t miss them. Setting timers, reminders, alarms and other bits via Siri work great, but things start to fall apart with more complex tasks or questions. It\u2019s the same on an iPhone, more or less. There\u2019s no Google Maps app on the Apple Watch, which is disappointing. Apple Maps is getting better, but it\u2019s really not that great in the UK. Citymapper offers an Apple Watch app, which is certainly better for getting around London and other major cities. Health Apple has slowly turned its smartwatch into one of the best multipurpose fitness trackers available. You name it, the Apple Watch can track or record it, apart from one glaring omission: sleep. The workout app has modes to track a huge list of activities and sports, from your usual running, walking, hiking, cycling and swimming to yoga, tai chi, dance, football, badminton, hockey, table tennis and even fishing. The Apple Watch automatically looks out for some workouts too. I get a notification to track an outdoor walk twice a day on my commute, which I found annoying enough to turn the feature off. For running the Apple Watch is surprisingly good, tracking everything a mid-range dedicated Garmin running watch would, including performance stats such as VO2 Max. It\u2019s got a long enough battery life with everything going to track a marathon, but I certainly feel it more as a lump on my wrist than my go-to Garmin Forerunner 235. There\u2019s a dedicated Strava app for the Apple Watch if that\u2019s your jam. Day-to-day health tracking is solid. The heart rate sensor measures your beats per minute throughout the day, logging it upwards of 12 times an hour or on-demand for you to view in the newly revitalised health app on your phone. But it can also notify you of abnormal heart rates, which are typically high when you\u2019re not doing anything. You can also manually take an electrocardiogram (ECG) by placing your finger on the crown for 30 seconds or so. The apps shows you the waveform in real time and notifies you if your heart beat looks irregular. Other daily activity tracking takes the form of Apple\u2019s activity rings: move in calories, exercise in minutes and stand in hours, complete with nags to stand up each hour if you haven\u2019t already. Steps and distance are also recorded, along with flights of stairs climbed, and you get awards if you beat your goals. Exporting your activity is fairly restricted, but as all the data is stored in Apple Health you can connect to third-party apps. Included too are menstrual cycle tracking and fall detection. New for the Series 5 is the noise app, which monitors environmental noise and warns you if you\u2019re in conditions that could damage your health. It also measures headphone volume on the iPhone, which may be just as useful for those listening to music too loudly. Battery life Battery life was the key worry for the Apple Watch with an always-on screen. Thankfully, I can report in day-to-day usage I was left with no less than 40% battery at the end of a day. It won\u2019t manage two 7am till 11pm days, but it won\u2019t fail you if you go for a run during the day or similar. An 18-minute, 4km run with GPS, heart rate monitoring, pace alerts and the screen always on consumed only 3% battery so marathons should be no bother. Observations The default app view is still the old honeycomb matrix of apps, which is hard to use, but can be switched to an easier and faster simple list with a hard press Taking calls on your wrist is novel and works amazingly well, but embarrassing when people stare at you in public (which is similar to attempting to talk to Siri) 4G is only useful if you happen to go out without your phone, so you can stay in touch seeing notifications, receiving messages and calls, or using maps if you\u2019re lost Price The Apple Watch Series 5 comes in two sizes, various different materials and models with the option of 4G. The aluminium or Nike versions are available with or without 4G. The 40mm costs \u00a3399 or \u00a3499 with 4G. The 44mm costs \u00a3429 or \u00a3529 with 4G. All other Apple Watch versions support 4G. The stainless steel model costs \u00a3699 (40mm) or \u00a3749 (44mm), while the titanium Edition starts at \u00a3799, the ceramic Edition starts at \u00a31,299 and the Hermes starts at \u00a31,249. For comparison, Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Watch Active 2 starts at \u00a3269, the Fossil Gen 5 smartwatch starts at \u00a3279, the Huawei Watch GT 2 costs \u00a3200 and the Fitbit Versa 2 starts at \u00a3200. Verdict Since its second generation the Apple Watch has been the best smartwatch for the iPhone. But for the Series 5 that\u2019s changed. It\u2019s not just the best smartwatch for the iPhone. The Apple Watch is now a solid reason to buy an iPhone in the first place. The screen being on all the time that was the last piece in the Apple Watch puzzle. What started out as a bit of a let down in 2015 has since been refined, sped up and had meaningful features added to it that make it far more than the sum of its parts. After five generations Apple has finally nailed it, but that\u2019s not to say the Series 5 is perfect. It would be great to have sleep tracking to close the circle on health tracking. It would be better if it lasted at least two days so you could go on a weekend away without bringing the charger. I wish there was a circular version too for variety, and it would be better for everyone if they didn\u2019t all look the same like some sort of clone army. Strap one of these to your wrist and you become part of a tribe: the Apple Watch wearers. Then there\u2019s the price. At \u00a3399 and up the Apple Watch Series 5 is in no way cheap. The Series 3 is still on sale from \u00a3199, but doesn\u2019t do it for me with that mostly-off screen. With the competition mostly coming in at under \u00a3300 the Series 5 has Apple\u2019s typical premium \u2013 but it\u2019s a premium anyone considering an Apple Watch has already paid for their iPhone. Simply put, the Apple Watch Series 5 is the best smartwatch you can buy right now. You might just need to also buy an iPhone to get it. Pros: excellent haptics, always-on screen, ECG, great health tracking, great activity tracking, solid running watch, 50m water resistance, all-day battery life, offline music, loads of watch faces, quick-swap straps, comfortable, Apple Pay Cons: expensive, only works with an iPhone, no sleep tracking, too popular Other reviews iPhone 11 review: an iPhone XR with a better camera iPhone 11 Pro review: the best small phone available iPhone 11 Pro Max review: salvaged by epic battery life Sony WF-1000XM3 review: updated noise-cancelling earbuds sound great Libratone Track Air+ review: the noise-cancelling AirPods Apple won\u2019t give you Bose Frames review: smart audio sunglasses are a blast Best true wireless earbuds 2019: AirPods, Samsung, Jabra, Beats and Anker compared and ranked",

Templeman acknowledges that the largest companies want to make their fleets more energy-efficient, but points out: \u201cWe\u2019re coming from the opposite direction and offering emission-free shipping right now, while asking what sail shipping could have been with another 100 years of development.\u201d Marcus Pomeroy-Rowden adds: \u201cWe\u2019re waving a flag to say the world can\u2019t carry on as it is. We\u2019re also showing what can be done in a different way.\u201d Bockermann stresses that industrial shipping is only cheap because it externalises the environmental costs. \u201cWhat you normally pay a shipping company doesn\u2019t account for the damage to the environment, pollution or health. Our costs are comparatively high but if you had to pay for the damage of conventional shipping then we wouldn\u2019t seem expensive.\u201d Geldenhuys adds: \u201cWe might not be the solution to how everything is shipped in the world but we can make people think about what they\u2019re buying and how it\u2019s getting here. It\u2019s easy to feel overwhelmed and helpless. But we can all do something. We don\u2019t need one solution to everything, we need a thousand solutions that can exist simultaneously.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

The result, he suggests, is that this most urgent of contemporary subject matter is being exiled to the borderlands of genre fiction, while literary fiction is in danger of becoming irrelevant. Unsurprisingly, he has been criticised for so summarily dismissing science fiction as an unworthy or less significant vehicle for the description, discussion and analysis of important subjects. The climate has been a central concern in sci-fi for more than five decades. Taking Ghosh\u2019s argument on its own terms, though, I am sure he would agree that the tide is beginning to turn. If climate chaos was previously too big a subject for \u201cserious\u201d writers to wrestle with, it is now too big to ignore. Any writer who does not seek to address it in some way runs the risk of joining the dinosaurs in their oblivion.</p> <p>With recent novels from Megan Hunter, Jenni Fagan, Richard Powers, Ben Smith, John Lanchester and Ghosh himself working hard to imagine the effects of climate crisis at both the global and the personal level, <em>Stillicide</em> can be added to the growing roster of powerful and urgent meditations on the future.

But while statistics like the fact that more than a quarter of minority ethnic students have faced both physical and verbal racist attacks are shocking, they\u2019re not new. Last year the Student Room found that <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/students-racism-university-campus-witness-higher-education-a8290561.html\">one in two students had witnessed or faced racism on campus</a>, while a <a href=\"https://www.nus.org.uk/en/news/race-for-equality/\">National Union of Students (NUS) report</a> said that incidents of racism made students of colour want to discontinue their education.</p> <p>I have heard anecdotes such as these firsthand. When the EHRC enquiry was launched I was serving as black students\u2019 officer at the NUS, where I was regularly contacted by students of colour to support them with the racism they were experiencing on and off campus. Some of these stories made it into the news, with stories of leaked <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/warwick-university-students-rape-threats-ban-racism-facebook-group-chat-campus-a8756126.html\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/exeter-university-student-reveals-why-he-leaked-friends-racist-whatsapp-messages-a3830741.html\">WhatsApp chats</a>, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/lancaster-university-students-tshirts-murder-abuse-rape-jokes-t-shirts-sugarhouse-society-a8631751.html\">pictures of socials</a>, and videos in <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-england-45683870/woman-racially-abused-while-at-university-speaks-out\">halls</a> going viral.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/oct/10/elite-universities-are-too-obsessed-with-tradition-to-tackle-racism-effectively\">Elite universities are too obsessed with tradition to tackle racism effectively | Clive Nwonka</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These stories and statistics can no longer be waved away as an aberration or minor part of some people\u2019s experiences. For students of colour, racism is a constant in their lives. It is woven into every part of their so-called \u201cstudent experience\u201d, from being freshers to finding employment. For black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) staff, the challenge of getting a job in a university is surpassed only by the difficulty in getting promoted in a profession in <a href=\"https://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/policy-and-analysis/reports/Documents/2019/bame-student-attainment-uk-universities-closing-the-gap.pdf\">which </a><a href=\"https://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/policy-and-analysis/reports/Documents/2019/bame-student-attainment-uk-universities-closing-the-gap.pdf\">only 0.6% of </a><a href=\"https://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/policy-and-analysis/reports/Documents/2019/bame-student-attainment-uk-universities-closing-the-gap.pdf\">UK professors are black</a>. Although some universities have begun to make progress on these issues, often by using the Race Equality Charter framework, too many are sitting idly by and failing students and staff.</p> <p>The problem is that racism and other forms of oppression are not something institutions want to readily admit exist, let alone begin the difficult work of rectifying. The marketisation of higher education has led to universities shifting focus from teaching and learning to protecting their reputations for fear of dropping in the league tables and losing out on students. In such a system, how can we expect universities to address racism, when the threat of bankruptcy looms with every low student intake? Meanwhile universities that are successful enough to expand are incentivised to increase their surplus, rather than looking after their students by increasing student support services or grants to the students\u2019 union.</p> <p>The focus on protecting the reputation of the institution was a theme of the EHRC report. One student said their university \u201cwas more bothered about covering the incident up to maintain a \u2018spotless\u2019 reputation than it was about tackling racism\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The extent of racism in UK universities has been yet again exposed by a new Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) report. But while statistics like the fact that more than a quarter of minority ethnic students have faced both physical and verbal racist attacks are shocking, they\u2019re not new. Last year the Student Room found that one in two students had witnessed or faced racism on campus, while a National Union of Students (NUS) report said that incidents of racism made students of colour want to discontinue their education. I have heard anecdotes such as these firsthand. When the EHRC enquiry was launched I was serving as black students\u2019 officer at the NUS, where I was regularly contacted by students of colour to support them with the racism they were experiencing on and off campus. Some of these stories made it into the news, with stories of leaked Facebook and WhatsApp chats, pictures of socials, and videos in halls going viral. These stories and statistics can no longer be waved away as an aberration or minor part of some people\u2019s experiences. For students of colour, racism is a constant in their lives. It is woven into every part of their so-called \u201cstudent experience\u201d, from being freshers to finding employment. For black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) staff, the challenge of getting a job in a university is surpassed only by the difficulty in getting promoted in a profession in which only 0.6% of UK professors are black. Although some universities have begun to make progress on these issues, often by using the Race Equality Charter framework, too many are sitting idly by and failing students and staff. The problem is that racism and other forms of oppression are not something institutions want to readily admit exist, let alone begin the difficult work of rectifying. The marketisation of higher education has led to universities shifting focus from teaching and learning to protecting their reputations for fear of dropping in the league tables and losing out on students. In such a system, how can we expect universities to address racism, when the threat of bankruptcy looms with every low student intake? Meanwhile universities that are successful enough to expand are incentivised to increase their surplus, rather than looking after their students by increasing student support services or grants to the students\u2019 union. The focus on protecting the reputation of the institution was a theme of the EHRC report. One student said their university \u201cwas more bothered about covering the incident up to maintain a \u2018spotless\u2019 reputation than it was about tackling racism\u201d. Universities have begun to fear that talking openly about racism will deter potential applicants, but an honest conversation about race in our universities is desperately needed. This has been called for by students, staff and academics for decades, but has gained momentum over the past few years with the Why is my curriculum white? and decolonising movements enabling people to articulate their visions of a fairer campus. For far too long universities have been exempt from public criticism thanks to their perception as elevated spaces of knowledge; places where liberalism and tolerance rule and which have meritocracy at their very heart. But studies like the EHRC report or research by the NUS black students\u2019 campaign have begun to tear down this myth. Yet for many, this myth never existed. Their experience at university isn\u2019t discussing lofty ideas in dreaming spires. It\u2019s being stopped by security; being asked to represent your \u201cpeople\u201d in a seminar; watching your junior colleagues getting promoted above you; being fearful of being referred to the home office at every student demonstration you attend; hearing lecturers use the \u201cn\u201d word; not using your \u201cethnic\u201d name when applying for graduate schemes and fearing the prevent duty. The truth is that from a historical perspective, universities have never been meritocratic or liberal. Many were created with the sole purpose of enabling people of wealth and prestige to accumulate further wealth and prestige. Their legacy includes training the next generation of people to run the British empire, funding from slavery and intellectualising eugenics to justify the racism on which the empire was built.

      "bodyText": "Some drug offences should be decriminalised in an attempt to stem the rising number of related deaths, an influential cross-party group of MPs has said in a call for radical change to the UK\u2019s drugs policy. The approach to drugs was \u201cclearly failing\u201d and policies should focus on healthcare, not prosecution, a report by the health and social care committee found. The committee, which is chaired by the Liberal Democrat Sarah Wollaston and includes the minister for military personnel and veterans, Johnny Mercer, said drug possession for personal use should be a civil rather than a criminal matter. A consultation on decriminalisation should be launched and significant investment directed into treatment services as a matter of urgency, the report said. The recommendations were broadly backed by campaigners and medical experts, but the government moved swiftly to say it had no plans to decriminalise drug possession. Wollaston said decriminalisation alone would not be sufficient and there needed to be a \u201cradical upgrade in treatment and holistic care for those who are dependent on drugs, and this should begin without delay\u201d. She added: \u201cEvery drug death should be regarded as preventable and yet across the UK, the number of drugs-related deaths continues to rise to the scale of a public health emergency. \u201cRecommendations put forward in this report propose changes to drugs policy that are desperately needed to prevent thousands of deaths. Avoidable drug deaths are increasing year on year across the UK, but there has been a failure to act on the evidence.\u201d The government should look at the system used in Portugal, where possession of all drugs had been decriminalised, the MPs said, adding such a move would save money from the criminal justice system and allow for more investment in treatment. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported that 4,359 deaths from drug poisoning were recorded in England and Wales in 2018, the highest since records began in 1993. Scotland\u2019s drug-related death toll also hit a record high of 1,187, according to data released in July, putting the country on a par with the US in per capita terms. Decriminalisation could save lives, the committee said, as it called for sufficient funding for alternative approaches, such as a pilot of drug consumption rooms \u2013 supervised healthcare facilities where users can take drugs in safer conditions. There should be needle and syringe exchanges and take-home naloxone, which can reverse the effects of opioids, the MPs said. Niamh Eastwood, the executive director of drug charity Release, said: \u201cThe committee is absolutely right to conclude that current UK drug policy is failing, with record levels of drug-related deaths \u2013 the highest for the seventh year in a row with 11 people dying every day. The recommendations of this report must be urgently implemented to reduce these avoidable deaths. \u201cWe welcome the support for increased funding for drug treatment and support for drug consumption rooms. \u201cThe call for the government to consult on decriminalisation is a positive move. The evidence from other countries that have ended criminal sanctions for possession offences shows that, when coupled with harm reduction and treatment, it can significantly reduce drug-related deaths.\u201d Prof David Nutt, the government\u2019s former chief drug misuse adviser who was sacked a decade ago for claiming ecstasy and LSD were less dangerous than alcohol, said: \u201cThis is not the first time parliamentary committees have recommended major changes to the drug and alcohol laws. Let\u2019s hope that this one is the last, and that the government take heed of this report.\u201d Nutt, now the director of the neuropsychopharmacology unit in the division of brain sciences at Imperial College London, added: \u201cFor this to happen the government must accept the vast body of evidence that they have ignored for decades and make the recommended changes.

      "body": "<p>How\u2019s your Black History Month going so far? I\u2019ve given a dozen talks \u2013 including one at a large firm where I was heckled by a senior partner who was furious that I was stressing the integral role of black people in British history. I\u2019ve talked to hundreds of black people about what life is like for them in predominantly white spaces.</p> <p>If I were to boil all those interactions down to one issue, it would be how we remember what really happened \u2013 what place it has in the nation, what visual guides exist to help us actually see this history, what narratives we tell. And the problem with Black History Month is that it\u2019s still just that. A month. Even in the best-case scenario where it gets maximum airtime, it\u2019s still just a twelfth of our annual headspace. That\u2019s a minimisation that echoes the lived experience of black people, still feeling the pressure to make themselves smaller in a world that too often regards us as marginal.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The wrecks of slave ships speak of African resistance, of remarkable rebellions and subversion on the high seas</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That there is very little of this history to see is undeniably part of the problem. Delivering this message to mostly white audiences, no matter how well intentioned, during the first half of Black History Month often makes me feel exoticised. So my survival strategy is to spend the second half in Ghana, whose flag blazes a black star, because here blackness is a source of both pride and normality.</p> <p>Yet the same pressures of erasure have operated on the way history is remembered in Africa, too. One of the first events I went to this month, once I arrived in the Ghanaian capital, Accra, was about a project to take the architectural plans of the almost 50 slave forts \u2013 built by the British and other Europeans, and which pepper the Ghanaian coast \u2013 and turn them into pieces of art. These castles are being described as a crucial, visible part of the puzzle for those still struggling to understand the interconnectedness of people of African heritage to British history.</p> <p>Another set of artworks, which I have spent this year exploring, is the wrecks of slave ships that are littered across the bed of the Atlantic Ocean but are barely seen or acknowledged. These watery graveyards speak to the full scale of European exploitation of Africans, but also of African resistance and agency, of remarkable rebellions and subversion on the high seas.</p> <p>As I and others have <a href=\"https://theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/18/universities-glasgow-slavery-pasts-legacy\" title=\"\">argued before</a>, one reason that British people feel complacent about Britain\u2019s role in pioneering slavery, and the racism that underpinned it, is that it happened slightly farther away. The Caribbean is Britain\u2019s own Deep South, where enslavement and segregation as brutal as anything that existed on American soil took place at the hands of British people. And that distance facilitates denial.</p> <p>If there is one useful thing we can all do this Black History Month, it is to bridge that distance. And that raises the question: why is there no memorial to enslaved Africans, on whose backs Britain was built, on British soil?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f361dbb9d3263036c472e23b7d05e44683942f71\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f361dbb9d3263036c472e23b7d05e44683942f71/0_62_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A maquette of memorial slavery statue by the sculptor Les Johnson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Despite the work of one tireless group \u2013 Oku Ekpenyon and her organisation Memorial 2007 \u2013 campaigning for such a memorial for nearly two decades, the government has failed to support it.\u2019 A maquette of memorial slavery statue.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johnny Green/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s a simple answer, and a complex one. The straightforward explanation is that despite the work of one tireless group \u2013 Oku Ekpenyon and her organisation <a href=\"http://www.memorial2007.org.uk/about\" title=\"\">Memorial 2007</a> \u2013 campaigning for such a memorial for nearly two decades, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/04/slavery-memorial-london-dropped\" title=\"\">government has failed to support it</a>. Ekpenyon\u2019s \u201cRemembering Enslaved Africans and Their Descendants\u201d memorial secured planning permission for a space in the rose gardens in Hyde Park, commissioned a design by the sculptor <a href=\"https://sculptors.org.uk/artists/les-johnson\" title=\"\">Les Johnson</a> and raised nearly \u00a3100,000. Many black British people \u2013 myself included \u2013 have given our money, time or energy to supporting it. But on 7 November the planning permission will expire, and the site will be lost if \u00a34m cannot be raised.</p> <p>That\u2019s not for want of a sophisticated campaign, or high-profile backing. Patrons of Memorial 2007 include Kate Davson, the great-great-great-granddaughter of the abolitionist William Wilberforce; the archbishop of York, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/john-sentamu\" title=\"\">John Sentamu</a>; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/paul-boateng\" title=\"\">Paul Boateng</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/may/30/uk.Whitehall1\" title=\"\">first black cabinet minister</a> in British history; and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/doreen-lawrence\" title=\"\">Doreen Lawrence</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/08/from-emperors-to-inventors-the-unsung-heroes-to-celebrate-in-black-history-month\">From emperors to inventors: the unsung heroes to celebrate in Black History Month</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But without the support of the government, \u00a34m is an impossible target to reach. Memorial 2007 has tried repeatedly to secure that support, having reached out to every prime minister from Tony Blair to Boris Johnson. The announcement in 2015 of \u00a350m in support for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/24/team-led-david-adjaye-design-uks-holocaust-memorial\" title=\"\">Holocaust memorial</a> raised the group\u2019s hopes.

      "bodyText": "How\u2019s your Black History Month going so far? I\u2019ve given a dozen talks \u2013 including one at a large firm where I was heckled by a senior partner who was furious that I was stressing the integral role of black people in British history. I\u2019ve talked to hundreds of black people about what life is like for them in predominantly white spaces. If I were to boil all those interactions down to one issue, it would be how we remember what really happened \u2013 what place it has in the nation, what visual guides exist to help us actually see this history, what narratives we tell. And the problem with Black History Month is that it\u2019s still just that. A month. Even in the best-case scenario where it gets maximum airtime, it\u2019s still just a twelfth of our annual headspace. That\u2019s a minimisation that echoes the lived experience of black people, still feeling the pressure to make themselves smaller in a world that too often regards us as marginal. That there is very little of this history to see is undeniably part of the problem. Delivering this message to mostly white audiences, no matter how well intentioned, during the first half of Black History Month often makes me feel exoticised. So my survival strategy is to spend the second half in Ghana, whose flag blazes a black star, because here blackness is a source of both pride and normality. Yet the same pressures of erasure have operated on the way history is remembered in Africa, too. One of the first events I went to this month, once I arrived in the Ghanaian capital, Accra, was about a project to take the architectural plans of the almost 50 slave forts \u2013 built by the British and other Europeans, and which pepper the Ghanaian coast \u2013 and turn them into pieces of art. These castles are being described as a crucial, visible part of the puzzle for those still struggling to understand the interconnectedness of people of African heritage to British history. Another set of artworks, which I have spent this year exploring, is the wrecks of slave ships that are littered across the bed of the Atlantic Ocean but are barely seen or acknowledged. These watery graveyards speak to the full scale of European exploitation of Africans, but also of African resistance and agency, of remarkable rebellions and subversion on the high seas. As I and others have argued before, one reason that British people feel complacent about Britain\u2019s role in pioneering slavery, and the racism that underpinned it, is that it happened slightly farther away. The Caribbean is Britain\u2019s own Deep South, where enslavement and segregation as brutal as anything that existed on American soil took place at the hands of British people. And that distance facilitates denial. If there is one useful thing we can all do this Black History Month, it is to bridge that distance. And that raises the question: why is there no memorial to enslaved Africans, on whose backs Britain was built, on British soil? There\u2019s a simple answer, and a complex one. The straightforward explanation is that despite the work of one tireless group \u2013 Oku Ekpenyon and her organisation Memorial 2007 \u2013 campaigning for such a memorial for nearly two decades, the government has failed to support it. Ekpenyon\u2019s \u201cRemembering Enslaved Africans and Their Descendants\u201d memorial secured planning permission for a space in the rose gardens in Hyde Park, commissioned a design by the sculptor Les Johnson and raised nearly \u00a3100,000. Many black British people \u2013 myself included \u2013 have given our money, time or energy to supporting it. But on 7 November the planning permission will expire, and the site will be lost if \u00a34m cannot be raised. That\u2019s not for want of a sophisticated campaign, or high-profile backing. Patrons of Memorial 2007 include Kate Davson, the great-great-great-granddaughter of the abolitionist William Wilberforce; the archbishop of York, John Sentamu; Paul Boateng, the first black cabinet minister in British history; and Doreen Lawrence. But without the support of the government, \u00a34m is an impossible target to reach. Memorial 2007 has tried repeatedly to secure that support, having reached out to every prime minister from Tony Blair to Boris Johnson. The announcement in 2015 of \u00a350m in support for a Holocaust memorial raised the group\u2019s hopes. It suggested that there was a renewed interest in remembering painful historic events. But that interest, it seems, does not extend to black Britons. It\u2019s true that the country\u2019s treatment of people descended from this history could not be more shameful. From the institutionalised racism they experienced fighting for Britain in both world wars, to the attempts to deport members of the Windrush generation just last year, they have endured the worst of what Britain has had to offer. But this campaign is not requesting a favour for a marginal section of society. The history of how we came to be this nation is a history for us all. If we can\u2019t dignify it with a simple memorial, one whose location, design, importance and even planning permission have already been established, then we really have lost the plot. \u2022 Afua Hirsch is a Guardian columnist",

She later grew disillusioned with the action-adventure gigs offered to her (she mentions getting jaded after working on a Michael Bay film \u2013 The Rock, judging from her IMDb page \u2013 before adding, \u201cMaybe I shouldn\u2019t use any names?\u201d) and decided to go into academia. It was at USC that she first made plans with colleague-turned-producer Bobette Buster to assemble a documentary adapting her lectures for a single bite-sized package. They floated some plans in the early 2000s, but had to wait a decade and change for the protections on fair use law to beef up so that they could excerpt major movie clips without paying an arm and a leg.</p> <p>The courts have since ruled that sampling footage will be acceptable so long as it\u2019s done in the spirit of public edification, and just like that, Costin was off. Between the connections she\u2019d made in the industry and favors called in from fellow sound people, she put together an all-star lineup of commentators. From her former student Ryan Coogler to Steven Spielberg, who named her the Kay Rose chair at USC\u2019s School of Cinematic Arts, the deep bench of experts dissect scenes classic and contemporary to illustrate the great quantities of work that go into creating and fine-tuning a soundscape. Spielberg, for example, goes into the subtly expressionistic quality of the shellshocking beach invasion that opens Saving Private Ryan.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"26924e43123ea16643984deafa13b14243958ba2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26924e43123ea16643984deafa13b14243958ba2/0_0_3039_1824/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Walter Murch mixing Apocalypse Now.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Walter Murch mixing Apocalypse Now.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matson Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Just about everyone takes good audio work for granted, from the casual viewer to the budget-balancers at the studios. \u201cThey say sound is 50% of the story, but on the films I was doing, the post-production sound budget would be 1% to 1.5% of the total,\u201d Costin recalls. \u201cThe average moviegoer thinks that when you turn on the camera, it starts also recording sound. They don\u2019t even get that they\u2019re recorded separately and synced. How much work going into sound, when done correctly, isn\u2019t even perceptible.\u201d</p> <p>She organized the many different roles in the audio side of the film world within a \u201ccircle of talent\u201d likening the conjunction of voice, sound effects and music to the cooperating sections of an orchestra. Each role requires precision, patience and perseverance. Smashing watermelons to approximate the noise of splintering femurs is all fun and games, but some tasks can be more tedious.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you think about doing footsteps, you\u2019ve got to do them for everyone. Everybody has their own unique footsteps,\u201d Costin says. \u201cSo many American films go abroad, and when you take out the production track, you lose everything. If someone\u2019s tapping their fingers while talking, you\u2019ll lose the tapping when they dump the dialogue for redubbing. The rerecording is extensive. They even have what\u2019s called a \u2018cloth track\u2019, where they just rub various fabrics to get the sound of people shifting in their chair or getting up \u2026 Sometimes, the most important sound can be a creak or a breath.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f4afdaf206058dee1912797261a32e1b425da66\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f4afdaf206058dee1912797261a32e1b425da66/0_143_4291_2575/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Midge Costin at the 2019 London film festival.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Midge Costin at the 2019 London film festival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Phillips/Getty Images for BFI</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her film concludes with an eye toward the future, focusing on technology as the driving force for sound\u2019s advancement in the theater and the home. Unlike the film purists that continue to keep mechanical methods alive, the audio set has fully embraced the computerized era. \u201cSome people will say it just sounds better with analog equipment,\u201d Costin concedes. \u201cBut the variety of things you can do, what you can see on the digital readouts, it gives you so many more options. Aside from the difference, which is hard to hear for a lot of people, we\u2019re all pretty happy to be on digital.\u201d</p> <p>On the consumer end, she\u2019s of two minds. She\u2019s gladly watched equipment affordable to the average family grow more sophisticated, but that\u2019s come with its own issues. \u201cThe problem sometimes comes down to how people have their home systems set up. Theaters get carefully calibrated, but listening at home leaves a lot of room for error. I\u2019d love for people to see movies in theaters.\u201d</p> <p>However the tools of its creation or display may change, Costin knows that her life\u2019s passion will be secure. Cinema needs sound to be its fullest, most exhilarating self, and sound needs artists to bring it to life. \u201cAs we watch things on smaller screens, sound gets even more important. The smaller someone\u2019s face gets, the more reliant we are on audio cues for emotion and tone of a scene.\u201d With a laugh, she adds, \u201cYou all need us!\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>Making Waves: The Art of Cinematic Sound is released in the US on 25 October and in the UK on 1 November</p></li> </ul>",

She later grew disillusioned with the action-adventure gigs offered to her (she mentions getting jaded after working on a Michael Bay film \u2013 The Rock, judging from her IMDb page \u2013 before adding, \u201cMaybe I shouldn\u2019t use any names?\u201d) and decided to go into academia. It was at USC that she first made plans with colleague-turned-producer Bobette Buster to assemble a documentary adapting her lectures for a single bite-sized package. They floated some plans in the early 2000s, but had to wait a decade and change for the protections on fair use law to beef up so that they could excerpt major movie clips without paying an arm and a leg. The courts have since ruled that sampling footage will be acceptable so long as it\u2019s done in the spirit of public edification, and just like that, Costin was off. Between the connections she\u2019d made in the industry and favors called in from fellow sound people, she put together an all-star lineup of commentators. From her former student Ryan Coogler to Steven Spielberg, who named her the Kay Rose chair at USC\u2019s School of Cinematic Arts, the deep bench of experts dissect scenes classic and contemporary to illustrate the great quantities of work that go into creating and fine-tuning a soundscape. Spielberg, for example, goes into the subtly expressionistic quality of the shellshocking beach invasion that opens Saving Private Ryan. Just about everyone takes good audio work for granted, from the casual viewer to the budget-balancers at the studios. \u201cThey say sound is 50% of the story, but on the films I was doing, the post-production sound budget would be 1% to 1.5% of the total,\u201d Costin recalls. \u201cThe average moviegoer thinks that when you turn on the camera, it starts also recording sound. They don\u2019t even get that they\u2019re recorded separately and synced. How much work going into sound, when done correctly, isn\u2019t even perceptible.\u201d She organized the many different roles in the audio side of the film world within a \u201ccircle of talent\u201d likening the conjunction of voice, sound effects and music to the cooperating sections of an orchestra. Each role requires precision, patience and perseverance. Smashing watermelons to approximate the noise of splintering femurs is all fun and games, but some tasks can be more tedious. \u201cWhen you think about doing footsteps, you\u2019ve got to do them for everyone. Everybody has their own unique footsteps,\u201d Costin says. \u201cSo many American films go abroad, and when you take out the production track, you lose everything. If someone\u2019s tapping their fingers while talking, you\u2019ll lose the tapping when they dump the dialogue for redubbing. The rerecording is extensive. They even have what\u2019s called a \u2018cloth track\u2019, where they just rub various fabrics to get the sound of people shifting in their chair or getting up \u2026 Sometimes, the most important sound can be a creak or a breath.\u201d Her film concludes with an eye toward the future, focusing on technology as the driving force for sound\u2019s advancement in the theater and the home. Unlike the film purists that continue to keep mechanical methods alive, the audio set has fully embraced the computerized era. \u201cSome people will say it just sounds better with analog equipment,\u201d Costin concedes. \u201cBut the variety of things you can do, what you can see on the digital readouts, it gives you so many more options. Aside from the difference, which is hard to hear for a lot of people, we\u2019re all pretty happy to be on digital.\u201d On the consumer end, she\u2019s of two minds. She\u2019s gladly watched equipment affordable to the average family grow more sophisticated, but that\u2019s come with its own issues. \u201cThe problem sometimes comes down to how people have their home systems set up. Theaters get carefully calibrated, but listening at home leaves a lot of room for error. I\u2019d love for people to see movies in theaters.\u201d However the tools of its creation or display may change, Costin knows that her life\u2019s passion will be secure. Cinema needs sound to be its fullest, most exhilarating self, and sound needs artists to bring it to life. \u201cAs we watch things on smaller screens, sound gets even more important. The smaller someone\u2019s face gets, the more reliant we are on audio cues for emotion and tone of a scene.\u201d With a laugh, she adds, \u201cYou all need us!\u201d Making Waves: The Art of Cinematic Sound is released in the US on 25 October and in the UK on 1 November",

      "bodyText": "Cases of anorexia are on the rise among preteen children in the UK and Ireland, research suggests, with rates having as much as doubled in 10 years. The study, which looked at cases of anorexia diagnosed by psychiatrists in hospitals or specialist clinics, estimates that 3.2 per 100,000 children aged between eight and 12 met criteria for anorexia for the first time in 2015, compared with 1.5 to 2.1 per 100,000 in 2006. Trends for older children could not be examined due to lack to comparable historical data. The research follows reports of a doubling in hospital admissions for eating disorders in the past six years, with the surge driven by an uptick in cases among teenage girls and women in their early 20s. Sarah Byford, a professor of health economics at King\u2019s College London and co-author of the new study, said those potentially vulnerable to developing an eating disorder may be being exposed to risk factors at an earlier age, including pressure to diet or do well at school. Alternatively, she said, the figures may be a positive story: \u201cThis finding might simply be that we are getting better at identifying young people [with anorexia],\u201d she said. Tom Quinn, of the eating disorder charity Beat, also urged further research into the trend, and said health service providers should ensure they were making the most of the available resources. \u201cSince 2016, substantial extra funding has been made available to the NHS in England for investment in specialist eating disorder services for under 18s, but not all commissioners and providers have prioritised these services sufficiently,\u201d he said. To conduct the study, published in the journal BMJ Open, Byford and colleagues asked all child and adolescent consultant psychiatrists based in hospitals, universities or community settings in the UK and Ireland to report the number of anorexia cases they had seen every month from February to September 2015. If a clinician reported a case, they were subsequently asked to fill in a questionnaire to allow the team to gather details of the patient and their diagnosis. Over the eight-month period, 305 cases were reported that met requirements for the study, with the vast majority in girls and people of white ethnicity. To calculate the rate of new cases of anorexia, the team took into account that only half of clinicians responded and others did not complete the questionnaire. The results suggest that among children aged eight to 17 years old, there are 13.7 new cases of anorexia per 100,000 people per year. Among girls the estimate was higher, at 25.7 per 100,000, with the age of diagnosis peaking at 15 years old. The team then focused on eight- to 12-year-olds, finding a marked increase in cases in recent years. But Byford said it was important to look at the figures in context. \u201cFor the younger children aged eight to 12 we are only talking maybe 250 [new cases a year],\u201d she said. Byford said that both the latest figures and earlier estimates probably underestimated the true incidence of anorexia, pointing out that many do not seek help, while older teenagers may go to adult services. The Royal College of Psychiatrists has said that fewer than a quarter of people with eating disorders in the UK receive treatment. Dr Agnes Ayton, chair of the eating disorders faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said \u201cThis study shows what psychiatrists have been seeing every day, which is a worrying rise in the number of young people suffering from the most deadly mental illness. The causes are complex, and much more research needs to be done in order to better support those affected.

      "bodyText": "Eastern parts of Australia will experience their hottest October day in years on Thursday as forecasters warn temperatures could hit 16C above average in some areas as the risk of bushfires increases. The Bureau of Meteorology says southern parts of South Australia, west and central parts of New South Wales and much of Victoria and Tasmania will see temperatures peak well above average on Thursday. By Saturday, temperatures will drop, but this will see a rise in bushfire risk for parts of northern NSW and south-east Queensland. NSW has already seen more bushland burned this fire season than in the two previous seasons combined. Diana Eadie, a meteorologist at the bureau, said: \u201cThis is a period of the year where we see extremes and can still get cooler days with exceptionally warm outbreaks. \u201cBut we have not had such a warm day for a number of years, and now we are also seeing elevated bushfire risk.\u201d Much of the heat, Eadie said, was being pulled into southern regions from the north of Australia, where temperatures had been unusually high earlier this week. On Monday, Darwin airport\u2019s thermometer recorded its second hottest daytime temperature on record at 38.2C, which was 0.7C short of the record set in 1982. The temperature record at that site goes back to 1941. Areas predicted to see the highest temperatures above average were in south-east South Australia and north-west Victoria. The bureau was not forecasting widespread record-breaking temperatures for Thursday, although Mount Gambier in South Australia could experience its hottest October day on record, with temperatures forecast to hit 35C. The city\u2019s record is 33.3C set in 1977. For Thursday, Melbourne could reach 32C, Hobart 27C and Canberra 31C. Sydney\u2019s peak for temperatures will come on Friday, with 33C forecast. A predicted 36C in Adelaide would be its hottest October day in four years. There was no strong signal for rain, outside of expected showers and storms as a cooler front moves through most of the south-east on Friday, moving through Sydney on Saturday. Concerns are also increasing about falling dam levels in Greater Sydney. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, a NSW government briefing document estimates it will take one metre of rainfall to \u201cbreak the current drought\u201d when the annual average was just 850mm. Inspector Ben Shepherd, of the NSW Rural Fire Service, said people should use the advance warning to discuss their survival plans \u201cand to know what they will do if they are threatened\u201d. He said this fire season had already seen more than 500,000 hectares of bushland burned, which was more than the past two seasons combined. More than 100 homes had been lost. Earlier this month an elderly couple died in their home in Coongbar, northern NSW, after a bushfire swept the area. Shepherd said: \u201cFrom Thursday we will start to see hot air moving in to NSW with westerly winds. That\u2019s going to see broad areas of high fire danger.\u201d He said some areas would be subject to severe fire risk on Friday, heading into Saturday. High temperatures, low humidity and high winds were driving up the risks, and those conditions would head to the southern parts of the state on Friday and Saturday. In South Australia, total fire bans are expected in much of the state. Yvette Dowling, SA Country Fire Service state duty commander, said: \u201cFor those areas of the state with total fire bans, we are asking the community to cease any risky activities, such as angle grinding.\u201d In south-east Queensland, the community of Peregian Beach on the Sunshine Coast was again threatened by a bushfire early on Wednesday, which Queensland Fire and Emergency Services said was now under control, with firebombing taking place. Adam Stevenson, the QFES acting deputy commissioner, said several regions would experience very high fire dangers on Friday, particularly in northern parts of the state. By Saturday, south-east Queensland would also see \u201cvery high\u201d fire danger, with areas bordering northern NSW reaching \u201csevere\u201d on Saturday. He advised vigilance and for the public to keep checking QFES and community messages. \u201cOur season started a little earlier than expected and we are certainly prepared for it to go on longer than expected, given the long range rainfall outlook from the bureau of meteorology, with a lack of rainfall across Queensland.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The former Australian border force boss Roman Quaedvlieg is to be the first witness called at public hearings next week into corruption allegations involving the agency\u2019s treatment of Crown casino high-rollers. The hearings, to be held in Melbourne by the Australian Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Michael Griffin, will also hear from the current border force deputy commissioner, Mandy Newton, and the first assistant secretary of Peter Dutton\u2019s home affairs department, Peta Dunn. Quaedvlieg, who was sacked for misbehaviour in March last year over allegations he denies, has claimed he was lobbied by two ministers and another MP to help smooth the way through border security for Crown\u2019s Chinese high-rollers. Nine newspapers have also alleged that a border force officer moonlighted as security for one of Crown\u2019s junket operators who was on Interpol\u2019s \u201cred notice\u201d list of international fugitives from justice. News that Quaedvlieg intends to give evidence comes ahead of Crown Resorts\u2019 annual shareholder meeting, to be held in Melbourne on Thursday, at which the company is likely to face questions about the series of investigations it is facing. Tuesday\u2019s ACLEI hearings will be the first the body, which investigates allegations relating to federal law enforcement officials, has held in public in its 13-year history. Griffin said the hearings would \u201cexamine the extent to which interactions between the Department of Home Affairs and Crown Casino raise issues of corruption\u201d. He said the issues involved \u201cand the significant public interest in those matters, has led me to conclude that this particular investigation will be best served by hearing matters in public where appropriate\u201d. The Sydney barrister David McLure SC, an Army Reserve colonel, will act as counsel assisting Griffin. Hearings are set to run until Friday and more are likely to be called as the investigation, dubbed Operation Angove, goes on. The ACLEI is one of six agencies investigating Crown after Nine newspapers and the media company\u2019s flagship TV current affairs program, 60 Minutes, levelled a series of allegations against the James Packer-backed casino group. Crown has furiously denied the Nine allegations, with its entire board signing a letter attacking \u201cunbalanced and sensationalised reporting [which] is based on unsubstantiated allegations, exaggerations, unsupported connections and outright falsehoods\u201d. The board also denied Crown ever sought to circumvent visa requirements. Two members of the board, which includes the former Howard-era minister for communications Helen Coonan, face re-election on Thursday: the former Australian Football League boss Andrew Demetriou and the advertising guru Harold Mitchell. Both have endured questions about their suitability as company directors. Demetriou was grilled in court earlier this year about his involvement with failed training group Acquire Learning, while Mitchell is currently fighting moves by the corporate regulator to have him disqualified from the boardroom over allegations that in late 2012 and early 2013, while at Tennis Australia, he helped the Seven Network get a cheap deal to broadcast the Australian Open. Meanwhile, in Victoria, home to Crown\u2019s biggest casino, the Victorian Commission for Gambling and Liquor Regulation is currently conducting two investigations into the casino group. One, which has been on foot for two years, focuses on the jailing of 19 Crown staff for gambling promotion crimes by Chinese authorities in 2016. The other, called by the Victorian gaming minister, Marlene Kairouz, in early August to look into allegations raised by Nine and others, was supposed to report back within three weeks but has also been delayed. \u201cThe investigation remains ongoing while the VCGLR endeavours to collect any additional relevant information and evidence,\u201d the regulator said in its annual report, tabled in state parliament last week. More public hearings are to be held in a separate inquiry in New South Wales into the fitness of Crown to hold the licence to run a mammoth casino currently under construction at Barangaroo. The NSW Independent Liquor &amp; Gaming Authority inquiry, run by the former judge Patricia Bergin, will investigate issues including whether Packer\u2019s decision to sell almost 20% of Crown to the Hong Kong billionaire Lawrence Ho\u2019s Melco empire breached the Barangaroo licence. Ho\u2019s father, Stanley, and some other members of the Ho family, are banned from involvement from Barangaroo over allegations the elder Ho has links to triad organised crime. Stanley Ho has always denied the allegations. As the Guardian has previously reported, one of Melco\u2019s ultimate shareholders, a company called Great Respect, has previously been linked to Stanley Ho. In addition, Lawrence Ho was a director of another company banned from Barangaroo due to its links with his father at the time he took possession of 10% of Crown. The Gaming and Wagering Commission of Western Australia is also investigating the allegations raised by Nine, while the federal anti-money laundering agency Austrac is working with the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission to look into the presence of organised crime in casinos.",

      "bodyText": "The Melbourne Press Club is in crisis after the resignation of three of its leadership team in the space of a few hours, including the Nine newspapers investigative journalist Adele Ferguson and the ABC\u2019s Michael Rowland. The resignations of club president Ferguson, the vice-president Rowland, and the chief executive Mark Baker, a former editor of the Canberra Times and senior editor at the Age, have thrown the future of the Quill awards, the Perkin award and other journalism programs in jeopardy. Rowland, the co-host of ABC News Breakfast, was the first to resign, telling the press club board on Tuesday night he could no longer tolerate the ongoing dispute between Baker and veteran club member and former Age editor Michael Smith. Rowland\u2019s resignation followed a failed attempt at mediation between the two men. \u201cDespite all the months of work we have put in trying to resolve the issue between Mark Baker and Mike Smith, it has become clear to me that it is unlikely to happen,\u201d Rowland said. \u201cI think it has reached a stage where the reputation of the club is now at serious risk and the matter needs to be urgently addressed at next week\u2019s meeting.\u201d Baker and Smith fell out over plans for the publication of a second press club book featuring Australian journalists who have been inducted into the Australian Media Hall of Fame. The dispute centred on the choice of publisher, Wilkinson Publishing, which Baker objected to because the Melbourne company had bought the Australian rights to the Milo Yiannopoulos book Dangerous, which was cancelled by Simon &amp; Schuster in 2017. The Hall of Fame was founded in 2011 and includes reporters, editors, broadcasters, photographers, cartoonists, commentators and publishers who have contributed to Australian society. The first book, Media Legends: Journalists who Helped Shape Australia, co-written by Smith and Baker, was published in 2014. Baker and Ferguson have confirmed they have resigned but have declined to comment. Smith also declined to comment. \u201cI have made this difficult decision after an unsatisfactory end to the lengthy mediation process between the Melbourne Press Club and Mike Smith,\u201d Rowland said in his letter. \u201cThat process culminated today with a formal mediation hearing involving myself, Adele Ferguson and Richard Leder (all appearing on behalf of the board) and Mike Smith. \u201cI have tried my best for the past eight months (as have Adele and Richard), and am completely spent.\u201d The Quill awards for excellence in Victorian journalism were established in 1995, joining the Perkin award for journalist of the year which carries a $20,000 cash prize. In August a separate dispute erupted at the club, when Baker dumped the family trust of the late Age investigative reporter David Wilson as the sponsor of the Quill for young journalist of the year in favour of a more lucrative offer from the Commonwealth Bank \u2013 whose \u201cunconscionable banking practices\u201d had been exposed by Ferguson, in a series that won her a Gold Walkley.",

So it can be quite daunting to push yourself and take that risk.\u201d</p> <p>If Cohen-Hatton is driven and tenacious, it may come partly from her experience of homelessness as a teenager, after her relationship with her mother broke down when she was 15. Sleeping rough in Newport, where she went to secondary school, she would get the bus to Monmouth and sell the Big Issue every day. After a year, she had managed to save enough to move away and rent a small flat in Risca, a town in south Wales, where she says \u201cno one would look at me with pity \u2013 I wanted to start afresh\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/04/grenfell-tower-report-to-be-released-a-day-before-brexit-deadline\">Grenfell Tower report to be released a day before Brexit deadline</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It took her a couple of attempts to get off the streets. \u201cIt\u2019s not as easy as getting a roof over your head and everything is fine: you\u2019re in a really vulnerable and volatile environment.

I guess I wanted to rescue other people in a way that no one had been able to rescue me,\u201d she says. Social work was out, because growing up she\u2019d thought of social workers as the enemy, although she now rates them.</p> <p>Cohen-Hatton has thrived in the fire service. \u201cI absolutely love it,\u201d she says. \u201cI still miss going to fires, because I think it\u2019s something you train so intensively for, it becomes part of your identity.

I\u2019ve received unsolicited and very inappropriate pictures [from other colleagues].\u201d Then, still in her late teens, Cohen-Hatton says she didn\u2019t report it because she was young and insecure. \u201cI felt like the balance of power was against me. And I was afraid that if I did speak out about it, then it would affect my reputation.\u201d</p> <p>Although she says the fire service today is \u201cworlds away\u201d from the service she joined in 2001, Cohen-Hatton \u201cabsolutely\u201d wants to encourage her staff to speak out: \u201cI have been very vocal in urging people who have experienced discrimination to come forward,\u201d she says.</p> <p>And the fire service has changed her life. \u201cI\u2019ve made some of the best friends of my life and have been around people who believe in me so strongly that they\u2019ve given me the self-belief to do things I never thought I\u2019d be capable of doing\u201d. Among those things are a PhD in behavioural neuroscience and writing a book, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-heat-of-the-moment-9780857525765.html\" title=\"\">The Heat of the Moment</a>, part memoir, part manual for how to respond in life and death situations. Published earlier this year, the production company behind Broadchurch has optioned the TV rights and it has brought her to the attention of the media and wider public. She was a recent guest on Radio 4\u2019s <a href=\"Https://www.Bbc.Co.Uk/programmes/m0008xy6\" title=\"\">Desert Island Discs</a>. </p> <p>During the terror attacks in Westminster in March 2017, Cohen-Hatton, then a deputy assistant commissioner<strong> </strong>at the London Fire Brigade, led its coordinating centre. \u201cIt was my job to decide what resources to dispatch, where it was safest to send in crews, and how to maintain a service for the rest of the city in case another incident occurred,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of pressure. I\u2019m conscious that the decisions I make can affect whether people live or die.\u201d A few months later, Cohen-Hatton ran the LFB\u2019s welfare centre after the Grenfell Tower fire to make sure firefighters had psychological support. \u201cGrenfell Tower was the biggest incident I, and many of my colleagues, will ever work on. The dedication, steely determination and effort to do all they could makes me proud of what our fire crews did that day. The scale and enormity of Grenfell changed so many lives. I was involved in the aftermath, and seeing pictures of the missing posted on walls and lamp posts on my way home the next day really hit home. The brigade\u2019s crews were exposed to things that many had never seen before and most are never likely to see again.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5352e00e61abfba52ed4b83067411081af353410\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5352e00e61abfba52ed4b83067411081af353410/0_61_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018The brigade\u2019s crews were exposed to things that many had never seen before and most are unlikely to see again.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The brigade\u2019s crews were exposed to things that many had never seen before and most are unlikely to see again.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While the inquiry is ongoing, Cohen-Hatton won\u2019t be drawn on whether the government has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/17/delays-to-safety-reforms-risk-a-repeat-of-grenfell-disaster\" title=\"\">learned the lessons from Grenfell</a>, but she is clear that preventing future incidents requires money. \u201cNationally, we have all felt the impact of austerity, which has affected the resources we have available to deliver our services. Between 2010 and 2017 the number of firefighters in the UK has decreased by more than one fifth. Average response times to primary fires have increased from 8.2 minutes to 8.7 minutes and the likelihood of a fire resulting in a fatality has similarly risen.\u201d</p> <p>West Sussex, like other fire services, is expecting to have to do more fire protection work in the light of Grenfell. This includes assessing high-risk buildings (including residential high-rises) to ensure public safety and provide reassurance about the risks of fire. \u201cWe also know that groups of people that are at greater risk of experiencing a fire are increasing. We have an increasingly ageing population, and more people with mobility problems or mental health issues. As these groups grow, we need to do more prevention work to stop them being affected by a fire.\u201d</p> <p>So, like other fire chiefs, Cohen-Hatton wants the government to increase funding. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that we can show we are efficient, but we need to have enough resources to be resilient as well,\u201d she says.</p> <p>She has joined West Sussex at a tricky time. In June, a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-48709369\" title=\"\">devastating report by Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire &amp; Rescue Services</a> found shortcomings in every area of the fire service, with its treatment of staff rated inadequate. <a href=\"http://www2.westsussex.gov.uk/ds/mis/mis240719.pdf\" title=\"\">West Sussex county council has given the fire service \u00a35.1m</a> over three years to make the necessary improvements. Cohen-Hatton says the main focus will be staff morale.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the first challenges for me coming in was to get people back into believing that their ideas are valuable, where they have a say and can make a contribution to improving the future.\u201d</p> <p> The absolute key to everything is getting the people bit right, because culture will eat strategy for breakfast every time.\u201d</p> <p>Cohen-Hatton is an ambassador for the Big Issue and is passionate about social mobility. \u201cYour circumstances don\u2019t have to define you: I want to challenge the perception of what a firefighter might look like. It\u2019s about being calm under pressure, being decisive and working well as part of a team.\u201d</p> <p>She admits that on paper she didn\u2019t look like a brilliant prospect. \u201cIt\u2019s a principle that I\u2019ve lived every day since: to always take people not on face value, but on the strength of who they could be.\u201d</p>",

And I was afraid that if I did speak out about it, then it would affect my reputation.\u201d Although she says the fire service today is \u201cworlds away\u201d from the service she joined in 2001, Cohen-Hatton \u201cabsolutely\u201d wants to encourage her staff to speak out: \u201cI have been very vocal in urging people who have experienced discrimination to come forward,\u201d she says. And the fire service has changed her life. \u201cI\u2019ve made some of the best friends of my life and have been around people who believe in me so strongly that they\u2019ve given me the self-belief to do things I never thought I\u2019d be capable of doing\u201d. Among those things are a PhD in behavioural neuroscience and writing a book, The Heat of the Moment, part memoir, part manual for how to respond in life and death situations. Published earlier this year, the production company behind Broadchurch has optioned the TV rights and it has brought her to the attention of the media and wider public. She was a recent guest on Radio 4\u2019s Desert Island Discs. During the terror attacks in Westminster in March 2017, Cohen-Hatton, then a deputy assistant commissioner at the London Fire Brigade, led its coordinating centre. \u201cIt was my job to decide what resources to dispatch, where it was safest to send in crews, and how to maintain a service for the rest of the city in case another incident occurred,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of pressure. I\u2019m conscious that the decisions I make can affect whether people live or die.\u201d A few months later, Cohen-Hatton ran the LFB\u2019s welfare centre after the Grenfell Tower fire to make sure firefighters had psychological support. \u201cGrenfell Tower was the biggest incident I, and many of my colleagues, will ever work on. The dedication, steely determination and effort to do all they could makes me proud of what our fire crews did that day. The scale and enormity of Grenfell changed so many lives. I was involved in the aftermath, and seeing pictures of the missing posted on walls and lamp posts on my way home the next day really hit home. The brigade\u2019s crews were exposed to things that many had never seen before and most are never likely to see again.\u201d While the inquiry is ongoing, Cohen-Hatton won\u2019t be drawn on whether the government has learned the lessons from Grenfell, but she is clear that preventing future incidents requires money. \u201cNationally, we have all felt the impact of austerity, which has affected the resources we have available to deliver our services. Between 2010 and 2017 the number of firefighters in the UK has decreased by more than one fifth. Average response times to primary fires have increased from 8.2 minutes to 8.7 minutes and the likelihood of a fire resulting in a fatality has similarly risen.\u201d West Sussex, like other fire services, is expecting to have to do more fire protection work in the light of Grenfell. This includes assessing high-risk buildings (including residential high-rises) to ensure public safety and provide reassurance about the risks of fire. \u201cWe also know that groups of people that are at greater risk of experiencing a fire are increasing. We have an increasingly ageing population, and more people with mobility problems or mental health issues. As these groups grow, we need to do more prevention work to stop them being affected by a fire.\u201d So, like other fire chiefs, Cohen-Hatton wants the government to increase funding. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that we can show we are efficient, but we need to have enough resources to be resilient as well,\u201d she says. She has joined West Sussex at a tricky time. In June, a devastating report by Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire &amp; Rescue Services found shortcomings in every area of the fire service, with its treatment of staff rated inadequate. West Sussex county council has given the fire service \u00a35.1m over three years to make the necessary improvements. Cohen-Hatton says the main focus will be staff morale. \u201cOne of the first challenges for me coming in was to get people back into believing that their ideas are valuable, where they have a say and can make a contribution to improving the future.\u201d The absolute key to everything is getting the people bit right, because culture will eat strategy for breakfast every time.\u201d Cohen-Hatton is an ambassador for the Big Issue and is passionate about social mobility. \u201cYour circumstances don\u2019t have to define you: I want to challenge the perception of what a firefighter might look like. It\u2019s about being calm under pressure, being decisive and working well as part of a team.\u201d She admits that on paper she didn\u2019t look like a brilliant prospect. \u201cIt\u2019s a principle that I\u2019ve lived every day since: to always take people not on face value, but on the strength of who they could be.\u201d",

Minutes earlier, he had been giving me a masterclass in how to trash-talk your opponent: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to pick something that will hurt their ego. They\u2019re confident, they\u2019re out there. So you say: \u2018Waste of time you being here. Are you just making up the numbers?\u2019\u201d But now Wolf is telling me about the little girl with cancer who used to visit the live shows and he is welling up. It turns out the Wolfman is a big old softie.</p> <p>Before meeting Wolf \u2013 real name Michael van Wijk, but of course we will call him Wolf \u2013 I lie in my hotel room, watching <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9jaLmdvbMU\" title=\"\">a two-and-a-half-hour supercut of his best bits </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9jaLmdvbMU\" title=\"\">on YouTube</a>. It is a tremendous montage of Wolf throwing his helmet at competitors and eating yellow cards and shouting at the referee John Anderson. I am watching Wolf square up to a contender when my phone vibrates. He is here.</p> <p>In real life, Wolf is a softly spoken, uxorious sweetheart, who buys me a Coke and bears scant resemblance to the menacing baddie we learned to love and hate in the 90s. He recalls the Wolfman persona with detached amusement. \u201cI approached the producers and said: \u2018Can I be bad?\u2019 They said: \u2018No. Everyone is squeaky clean in this. It\u2019s for kids \u2013 you can\u2019t be bad.\u2019 I said: \u2018Please \u2013 the name lends itself to it. Big bad wolf. If you don\u2019t like it, I\u2019ll never do it again.\u2019 They said: \u2018OK, for one show.\u2019 I did it and the crowd just exploded.\u201d The Wolf character evolved over time. \u201cI realised you can\u2019t be bad every show. Sometimes you have to be nice.\u201d He puts on the Wolf voice for me. \u201cHe\u2019s big, he\u2019s bad,\u201d Wolf growls. I am in raptures.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1850b377a6eb031654f1cd2e3d23772350885dfd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1850b377a6eb031654f1cd2e3d23772350885dfd/0_0_1888_1339/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The 1998 lineup of Gladiators\" width=\"1000\" height=\"709\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The 1998 lineup of Gladiators ... back row: Warrior, Raider, Hunter, Saracen and Trojan; middle: Falcon, Rhino, Cobra, Nightshade, Wolf and Panther; front: Amazon, Vogue, Lightning, Jet and Zodiac.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The main thing Wolf would like you to know is that, almost 20 years after Gladiators left terrestrial TV, he is still in thunderously good shape and could take on any challenge the producers threw at him, were they to bring back the show. We discuss his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jan/07/high-on-fat-low-on-evidence-the-problem-with-the-keto-diet\" title=\"\">keto diet</a> and training regimen. \u201cLots of men let their legs go,\u201d Wolf says. \u201cNot me.\u201d (I suspect this is why he is wearing athletic shorts in October.) It is clear he misses the glory days of performing before a 10,000-capacity crowd, all madly rooting for him and baying for his blood at the same time. Sky brought him back as a team captain for its 2008 reboot, but it wasn\u2019t the same. \u201cIt was like going to someone\u2019s wedding when it should be you getting married. I wanted to take part. I was fit and ready.\u201d</p> <p>To this day, Gladiators enjoys a hypnotic pull on the British consciousness. I know this first-hand. A child of the 90s, I am so cravenly excited to meet Wolf that my most-used emoji in the week leading up to our interview is a tiny wolf. His voice \u2013 unmistakably low, dangerous \u2013 was the voice of my childhood reveries and the prepubescent inkling that being bad could be good. I am not alone. Stop the average thirtysomething in the street and boom: \u201cContenders \u2026 ready!\u201d at them and they will respond: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_dLpKUxNc\" title=\"\">Gladiators \u2026 ready!</a>\u201d with religious zeal.

His cheery air and deep tan cannot hide the traces of his recent illness. (The 55-year-old was hospitalised with pneumonia earlier this year.) As I look at Cobra sitting underneath the photo of himself in his prime, his hair permed to a magnificent scrubbing brush, he intuits what I am thinking. \u201cI keep seeing people bringing photos of me from 20 years ago and it\u2019s depressing,\u201d he says. \u201cBut what can you do?\u201d</p> <p>Leaning in, he lets me in on a secret: sometimes he would be drunk during filming. \u201cI remember looking at the Wall and thinking: \u2018I\u2019ve got to chase this guy up it and I\u2019m bleeding drunk<em>.\u2019\u201d</em> He almost got fired by the producer Nigel Lythgoe, but the crew stuck up for him.

I am struck by how vulnerable many of her \u2013 mostly male \u2013 fans seem to be. One man\u2019s hands shake as he unpacks a plastic wallet full of photographs for signing. Another presents her with a handmade twine bracelet, which she accepts graciously. Although she spends a long time chatting with fans and seems genuinely invested in their stories, watching some of them part with money in exchange for autographs and photos makes me uneasy.</p> <p>After the event, I catch up with Jet at her hotel. Dressed in a chunky jumper, her hair still in that famous side-sweep, Jet appears tired from the day\u2019s exertions \u2013 I recognise a fellow introvert \u2013 and rarely makes eye contact. She trained as a choreographer before being recruited for the show at 22. (She is now 49.) Fame was jarring. \u201cIt was weird,\u201d she laughs, face in hands. \u201cBeing famous was never on my trajectory.\u201d What was it like, being the show\u2019s sex symbol? \u201cI hated it. You know how I\u2019d do the hair flick and cartwheels and the funny naff dancing? There was a reason for it. When the camera was coming to me, I wouldn\u2019t stand still \u2026 When you\u2019re moving, people can\u2019t look at your cellulite.\u201d</p> <p>Jet left the show in 1996, after sustaining a neck injury falling from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5_ivBV7FMo\" title=\"\">the Pyramid</a>. (It was notorious for injuries \u2013 Amazon, Rhino and Wolf also injured themselves there.) She tried presenting, before qualifying as a psychotherapist. Her training enabled her to reflect critically on her fame. \u201cThere is something that happens in that moment where someone discovers you are famous \u2026 You can\u2019t be who you genuinely are.\u201d She is thankful that most people know her by the Jet persona, not her real name. \u201cIt\u2019s Jet that\u2019s famous. Diane is a private person.\u201d</p> <p>Looking back, it is easy to forget the level of fame the gladiators enjoyed. Rhino \u2013 real name Mark Smith \u2013 got recognised on safari in Zimbabwe. \u201cWe were in the Land Rover and someone leaned over and said: \u2018Eh, Rhino, do you think we might see a rhino?\u2019\u201d (They did.) He is speaking on the phone from Los Angeles, where he works as an actor and producer. \u201cI think I\u2019m the most successful gladiator!\u201d Rhino laughs. \u201cI\u2019ve been very lucky.\u201d He recently produced the forthcoming Orlando Bloom film <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3833480/\" title=\"\">The Outpost</a> \u2013 and celebrated turning 50 by going skydiving.</p> <p>\u201cMy ambition is to get Hang Tough in churches,\u201d says Ace (Warren Furman) as we sit drinking coffee in the shadow of York Minster. That was the game in which gladiators swung themselves across the arena on a series of hanging rings. \u201cYou know how you do the communion? I reckon you should be able to Hang Tough your way straight up there. I think people would enjoy that.\u201d It takes me a few beats to realise he is serious \u2013 he has the equipment already and just needs to persuade a church to let him rig it up.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I took a contract for the Ace biscuit, not knowing that the strapline was \u2018The incredibly thick chocolate biscuit\u2019</p> <footer> <cite>Ace (Warren Furman)</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Ace, 47, became a born-again Christian five years ago and is charmingly self-aware about his conversion. \u201cThe other gladiators think I\u2019ve completely lost my mind.\u201d I like Ace \u2013 he is hilarious and sincere and doesn\u2019t try to convert me.

He goes: \u2018You ain\u2019t a real gladiator.\u2019 I was like: I\u2019m such a loser.\u201d After that debacle, Ace prayed: \u201cI said: \u2018Father, you need to get me something \u2026 You need to get me some proper gladiator armour.\u2019\u201d The prayer was soon answered: Ace found an original costume from the 2000 Russell Crowe film Gladiator on Gumtree, for \u00a360.</p> <p>Earlier, standing in the cathedral\u2019s crypt, Ace tells me about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/jun/07/york-gladiator-graveyard\" title=\"\">mass grave of Roman gladiators</a> that was unearthed nearby. Whether physical or psychological, a gladiator always pays a price. Ace recalls standing on the arena floor during the 2015 Gladiators reunion. \u201cIt was melancholy,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were all ringing each other afterwards and saying: \u2018Remember when we were young?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Yes: I remember the gladiators when they were young and in their prime, godlike in the rubber and foam of 90s entertainment TV. I need only to close my eyes and I am eight again, crossed-legged on the floor, palms slick with excitement. On the telly, a gladiator stretches a hand towards the next hanging ring. Eternally swinging: above them, Mount Olympus; beneath them, crash mats.</p>",

      "bodyText": "I am sitting in the reception of a Best Western hotel in Stoke-on-Trent with Wolf from Gladiators and I think he is about to cry. Minutes earlier, he had been giving me a masterclass in how to trash-talk your opponent: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to pick something that will hurt their ego. They\u2019re confident, they\u2019re out there. So you say: \u2018Waste of time you being here. Are you just making up the numbers?\u2019\u201d But now Wolf is telling me about the little girl with cancer who used to visit the live shows and he is welling up. It turns out the Wolfman is a big old softie. Before meeting Wolf \u2013 real name Michael van Wijk, but of course we will call him Wolf \u2013 I lie in my hotel room, watching a two-and-a-half-hour supercut of his best bits on YouTube. It is a tremendous montage of Wolf throwing his helmet at competitors and eating yellow cards and shouting at the referee John Anderson. I am watching Wolf square up to a contender when my phone vibrates. He is here. In real life, Wolf is a softly spoken, uxorious sweetheart, who buys me a Coke and bears scant resemblance to the menacing baddie we learned to love and hate in the 90s. He recalls the Wolfman persona with detached amusement. \u201cI approached the producers and said: \u2018Can I be bad?\u2019 They said: \u2018No. Everyone is squeaky clean in this. It\u2019s for kids \u2013 you can\u2019t be bad.\u2019 I said: \u2018Please \u2013 the name lends itself to it. Big bad wolf. If you don\u2019t like it, I\u2019ll never do it again.\u2019 They said: \u2018OK, for one show.\u2019 I did it and the crowd just exploded.\u201d The Wolf character evolved over time. \u201cI realised you can\u2019t be bad every show. Sometimes you have to be nice.\u201d He puts on the Wolf voice for me. \u201cHe\u2019s big, he\u2019s bad,\u201d Wolf growls. I am in raptures. The main thing Wolf would like you to know is that, almost 20 years after Gladiators left terrestrial TV, he is still in thunderously good shape and could take on any challenge the producers threw at him, were they to bring back the show. We discuss his keto diet and training regimen. \u201cLots of men let their legs go,\u201d Wolf says. \u201cNot me.\u201d (I suspect this is why he is wearing athletic shorts in October.) It is clear he misses the glory days of performing before a 10,000-capacity crowd, all madly rooting for him and baying for his blood at the same time. Sky brought him back as a team captain for its 2008 reboot, but it wasn\u2019t the same. \u201cIt was like going to someone\u2019s wedding when it should be you getting married. I wanted to take part. I was fit and ready.\u201d To this day, Gladiators enjoys a hypnotic pull on the British consciousness. I know this first-hand. A child of the 90s, I am so cravenly excited to meet Wolf that my most-used emoji in the week leading up to our interview is a tiny wolf. His voice \u2013 unmistakably low, dangerous \u2013 was the voice of my childhood reveries and the prepubescent inkling that being bad could be good. I am not alone. Stop the average thirtysomething in the street and boom: \u201cContenders \u2026 ready!\u201d at them and they will respond: \u201cGladiators \u2026 ready!\u201d with religious zeal. But before Gladiators became an unstoppable cultural force that caused grownups to go completely gaga, it was London Weekend Television\u2019s flagship light-entertainment show. Launched in 1992, it gave PAs, chartered surveyors and mums from Liverpool the chance to bash athletic superstars with giant pugil sticks in the National Indoor Arena (now Arena Birmingham). This was the golden age of Saturday-night TV, a prelapsarian period when Noel Edmonds and our Cilla ruled the airwaves, when there were only four channels (until the arrival of Channel 5 in 1997) and the Wolfman and Mr Blobby would face off in the weekly ratings battle. It came to an end in 2000, when LWT cancelled the show due to falling ratings. The gladiators disbanded. But when you have been a gladiator in the foam and the muck of Saturday-night telly, where do you go? In Wolf\u2019s case, New Zealand. When the panto bookings and personal appearance gigs dried up \u2013 no more rainy Wednesday mornings opening branches of Argos \u2013 he opened a chain of gyms. He needed to earn a living \u2013 they all did. \u201cThe money for Gladiators was pathetic,\u201d says Wolf, now 67. Unlike the gladiators on the US version of the show, none of the British stars received repeat fees; mostly, they made money from corporate gigs. Because Wolf was the star of the show, he got the most work, which caused some resentment among his colleagues. But none of that tension is on display the following day at the comic convention Stoke Con Trent. Children take photos with Iron Man and a man in a Chewbacca outfit drinking coffee. Bradley from S Club 7 sits behind a folding table, charging \u00a35 for selfies and \u00a315 for a signed photo. At the back of the room, four gladiators \u2013 Cobra (Michael Anthony Willson), Lightning (Kim Betts), Wolf and fan favourite Jet (Diane Youdale) \u2013 are perched on stools.

Now he sees Gladiators as an advantage for his Christian evangelism \u2013 he appears in schools dressed as a gladiator, spreading the good news. But his first attempt at proselytising in a primary school didn\u2019t go to plan. He had bought a plastic gladiator outfit from eBay, but it was cheap-looking and naff. \u201cThis kid comes up to me, grabs the plastic sword and taps it. He goes: \u2018You ain\u2019t a real gladiator.\u2019 I was like: I\u2019m such a loser.\u201d After that debacle, Ace prayed: \u201cI said: \u2018Father, you need to get me something \u2026 You need to get me some proper gladiator armour.\u2019\u201d The prayer was soon answered: Ace found an original costume from the 2000 Russell Crowe film Gladiator on Gumtree, for \u00a360. Earlier, standing in the cathedral\u2019s crypt, Ace tells me about the mass grave of Roman gladiators that was unearthed nearby. Whether physical or psychological, a gladiator always pays a price. Ace recalls standing on the arena floor during the 2015 Gladiators reunion. \u201cIt was melancholy,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were all ringing each other afterwards and saying: \u2018Remember when we were young?\u2019\u201d Yes: I remember the gladiators when they were young and in their prime, godlike in the rubber and foam of 90s entertainment TV. I need only to close my eyes and I am eight again, crossed-legged on the floor, palms slick with excitement. On the telly, a gladiator stretches a hand towards the next hanging ring. Eternally swinging: above them, Mount Olympus; beneath them, crash mats.",

The documentary explores a subculture that was inspired by the west yet distinctly homegrown \u2013 existing in a society shaped by communism and watched over by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/19/spies-spooks-hitmen-kgb-never-went-away-russia-putin\">the KGB</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIn the west, nobody was arrested simply for having long hair or wearing strange clothes,\u201d Toomistu explains.

The first red hippies were the sons or daughters of the privileged Soviet nomenklatura<em> </em>\u2013 well-behaved kids from elite families. They had access to music from the capitalist world and to jeans. By the early 70s, the movement had grown sufficiently big and unruly to alarm the authorities \u2013 though it probably only ever numbered a few thousand, Toomistu says. The secret police began tailing the long-haired to school. In June 1971, the hippies were given permission to demonstrate against the Vietnam war outside the US embassy in Moscow.</p> <p>This was a trap. The KGB rounded up and arrested demonstrators, with the goal of wiping out hippy culture. Some demonstrators were sent to psychiatric facilities and injected with insulin; others dispatched to the army and camps near the Chinese border. The film re-creates this grim clampdown and uses surveillance photos found in KGB archives in Lithuania.</p> <p>According to Lampmann, harassment by the police and KGB was common. \u201cOne of my close friends ended up in prison,\u201d he says.

They said \u2018look they\u2019re not going to come back to pick them up.\u2019\u201d He said the photographs could be seen as an extreme form of hypocrisy. But he also found them \u201cincredibly touching\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m almost envious of the photographer that they could take these portraits of these guys \u2026 the Taliban then were the absolute personification of evil and you have them holding hands with plastic flowers. It is very confusing but I like that.\u201d Dworzak published a book of the pictures and was criticised by some for making fun of the men; by others of showing them in too positive a light. \u201cI never expected that reaction. A lot of people also thought I took the pictures. \u201cWhat is important I think is that this is not a Taliban-specific aesthetic. It is something you can find in the sub-continent, in India and Pakistan. The extra twist is the Taliban banned photography.\u201d The photographs will be included in a major group show titled Masculinities: Liberation Through Photography featuring work by 50 artists including Annette Messager, Richard Avedon, Isaac Julien and Catherine Opie. It is part of a wider year-long season at the Barbican called Inside Out, exploring the relationship between people\u2019s inner lives and creativity. Theatrical highlights will include two shows directed by Ivo van Hove \u2013 an adaptation of Thomas Mann\u2019s Death in Venice and Tennessee Williams\u2019 The Glass Menagerie starring Isabelle Huppert as Amanda; and a new production from Belarus Free Theatre which is being staged 10 years since it was put in political exile. \u2022 Masculinities: Liberation through Photography is at the Barbican art gallery 20 February-17 May.",

Express sympathy with Mrs Joyce and explain inability to attend funeral.\u201d</p> <p>Consequently, no official representative of the Irish state was present at the burial of one of the century\u2019s most significant cultural figures, and probably the most celebrated Irishman in history.</p> <p>Joyce\u2019s relationship with his country was famously vexed. He left for good in his early 20s, driven out \u2013 \u201cexiled\u201d, as he himself liked to put it \u2013 by its spiritual impoverishment, its relentless oppression of those who tried to live and think beyond its parochial norms. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/04/100-best-novels-ulysses-james-joyce-robert-mccrum\" title=\"\">Ulysses</a> was never officially banned in Ireland for the simple reason that no bookseller was reckless enough to attempt getting it through customs. And yet for all the world-encircling magnitude of his genius, the universality of his themes, it was Ireland, and specifically Dublin, that remained the inexhaustible subject of his work. When he was asked toward the end of his life whether he would ever consider returning to the place, he answered: \u201cHave I ever left it?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If you care about his work, as opposed to the revenue streams it might represent, Dublin is inseparable from Joyce</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This question of return has lately been raised again, in the form of two Dublin city councillors, Dermot Lacey and Paddy McCartan, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/15/bid-to-repatriate-james-joyce-remains-ulysses-centenary\" title=\"\">proposing a motion to seek</a> the repatriation of his remains in time for the centenary of Ulysses\u2019s publication in 2022. There is no evidence that Joyce himself ever expressed a desire to be buried in the country of his birth, but the councillors cited an apparent effort by his widow Nora in the late 1940s to have his remains returned to Dublin. \u201cThe benefit of this,\u201d said Lacey, \u201cis that you\u2019re honouring someone\u2019s last wishes.\u201d But of course the honouring of Nora\u2019s wishes \u2013 evidence for which, as the Joyce scholar Sam Slote pointed <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/letters/james-joyce-s-final-resting-place-1.4051566\" title=\"\">out in the Irish Times,</a> is not all that compelling \u2013 was hardly the true motivation for digging up her husband\u2019s earthly remains and sticking them on the next Ryanair flight out of Zurich. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be cynical about bones,\u201d Lacey said, before immediately going on to be quite cynical about bones: \u201cI think it\u2019s something Joycean lovers would appreciate. I don\u2019t want to calculate something like this in shillings and pence but I don\u2019t think it would do any harm. I think it would do some good.\u201d</p> <p>There is a distasteful irony to this whole idea. Joyce could neither live nor work in the Ireland of his time \u2013 a suffocating theocracy that foreclosed every possibility of freedom: intellectual, sexual and existential. \u201cDo you know what Ireland is?\u201d as Stephen Dedalus puts it in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/dec/29/colm-toibin-james-joyce-a-portrait-of-the-artist-as-a-young-man\" title=\"\">A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</a>. \u201cIreland is the old sow that eats her farrow.\u201d A century after the publication of Ulysses, capitalism \u2013 which has since supplanted Catholicism as Ireland\u2019s officially professed faith \u2013 has come to see the value of Joyce and his work, and he has taken his place in the pantheon of Irish brands, as a sort of <a href=\"https://www.irishcentral.com/roots/history/arthur-guinness-history-legend\" title=\"\">Arthur Guinness</a> of literary modernism. The old sow wants the bones of her farrow back, because there is still some meat to gnaw on.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d4a5d7e8b7c4af91d19db415ba0131b6710da9f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d4a5d7e8b7c4af91d19db415ba0131b6710da9f1/0_76_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bloomsday celebrations in Dublin, 2015\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It would become one more way for Dublin to present itself as a literary mecca.\u2019 Bloomsday celebrations in Dublin, 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ruth Medjber</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not that it seems particularly likely to happen. As Fritz Senn, director of the Zurich James Joyce Foundation, has pointed out, in the absence of any compelling evidence that this is what Joyce would have wanted, there is little incentive for the Swiss to give up his body: \u201cI think there would certainly be some resistance because, after all, Joyce is one of the major tourist attractions that people come to see.

      "bodyText": "When James Joyce died in Zurich in 1941, the Irish government\u2019s chief diplomat in Switzerland contacted the secretary of the Department of External Affairs in Dublin to inform him of the news. \u201cPlease wire details about Joyce\u2019s death,\u201d responded the secretary. \u201cIf possible find out if he died a Catholic? Express sympathy with Mrs Joyce and explain inability to attend funeral.\u201d Consequently, no official representative of the Irish state was present at the burial of one of the century\u2019s most significant cultural figures, and probably the most celebrated Irishman in history. Joyce\u2019s relationship with his country was famously vexed. He left for good in his early 20s, driven out \u2013 \u201cexiled\u201d, as he himself liked to put it \u2013 by its spiritual impoverishment, its relentless oppression of those who tried to live and think beyond its parochial norms. Ulysses was never officially banned in Ireland for the simple reason that no bookseller was reckless enough to attempt getting it through customs. And yet for all the world-encircling magnitude of his genius, the universality of his themes, it was Ireland, and specifically Dublin, that remained the inexhaustible subject of his work. When he was asked toward the end of his life whether he would ever consider returning to the place, he answered: \u201cHave I ever left it?\u201d This question of return has lately been raised again, in the form of two Dublin city councillors, Dermot Lacey and Paddy McCartan, proposing a motion to seek the repatriation of his remains in time for the centenary of Ulysses\u2019s publication in 2022. There is no evidence that Joyce himself ever expressed a desire to be buried in the country of his birth, but the councillors cited an apparent effort by his widow Nora in the late 1940s to have his remains returned to Dublin. \u201cThe benefit of this,\u201d said Lacey, \u201cis that you\u2019re honouring someone\u2019s last wishes.\u201d But of course the honouring of Nora\u2019s wishes \u2013 evidence for which, as the Joyce scholar Sam Slote pointed out in the Irish Times, is not all that compelling \u2013 was hardly the true motivation for digging up her husband\u2019s earthly remains and sticking them on the next Ryanair flight out of Zurich. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be cynical about bones,\u201d Lacey said, before immediately going on to be quite cynical about bones: \u201cI think it\u2019s something Joycean lovers would appreciate. I don\u2019t want to calculate something like this in shillings and pence but I don\u2019t think it would do any harm. I think it would do some good.\u201d There is a distasteful irony to this whole idea. Joyce could neither live nor work in the Ireland of his time \u2013 a suffocating theocracy that foreclosed every possibility of freedom: intellectual, sexual and existential. \u201cDo you know what Ireland is?\u201d as Stephen Dedalus puts it in A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. \u201cIreland is the old sow that eats her farrow.\u201d A century after the publication of Ulysses, capitalism \u2013 which has since supplanted Catholicism as Ireland\u2019s officially professed faith \u2013 has come to see the value of Joyce and his work, and he has taken his place in the pantheon of Irish brands, as a sort of Arthur Guinness of literary modernism. The old sow wants the bones of her farrow back, because there is still some meat to gnaw on. Not that it seems particularly likely to happen. As Fritz Senn, director of the Zurich James Joyce Foundation, has pointed out, in the absence of any compelling evidence that this is what Joyce would have wanted, there is little incentive for the Swiss to give up his body: \u201cI think there would certainly be some resistance because, after all, Joyce is one of the major tourist attractions that people come to see. Many people go to his grave so there would be an issue.\u201d It\u2019s also worth remembering that any plan to remove the body from the family plot would first have to be approved by the writer\u2019s grandson, Stephen Joyce, a literary executor so legendarily unaccommodating that he once informed a performance artist that he\u2019d infringed on copyright by merely memorising passages of Finnegans Wake. If Dublin city council were to somehow pass the resolution, and then somehow convince the Irish government to seek the repatriation of Joyce\u2019s body, and if the Irish government in turn were to somehow convince the Swiss authorities to relinquish it from their soil, what would happen? What would happen, we can be confident, is that Joyce\u2019s body would become one more tourist trap in a city that is essentially a gigantic tax loophole filled with tourists in expensive raingear and homeless bodies in sleeping bags. What would happen is that it would become one more way for Dublin to present itself as a literary mecca, while in reality transitioning into a cultural wasteland where creative spaces are closing down to make way for more hotels, where artists can\u2019t afford to live due to a brutal and unregulated rental market \u2013 one presided over by a ruling party, Fine Gael, many of whose parliamentary members are also landlords. What would happen is that Joyce\u2019s bones would bring more tourists to a city that, were he alive today, he would still have to leave because he couldn\u2019t afford to live in it. And what would furthermore happen, I may as well warn you now, is that I would personally dig up those bones in the dead of night, haul them into eternity along Sandymount strand, and heave them into the snot-green, scrotum-tightening sea. The fact, in any case, is that to remove those bones from Zurich and put them in the ground beneath Dublin would be in some fundamental sense a meaningless gesture. Joyce\u2019s presence in this city is already radically overdetermined, overbearing in its intimacy and immanence.

The same is true of countless places I, as a Dubliner, encounter every day, such as the large Georgian house on the quays I walk by with my son on the way to school, a house that is abandoned and crumbling like so many other buildings in a city in the throes of a housing crisis, and which happens to be where the short story The Dead is set. Even in his absence, there is no getting away from Joyce. The whole city of Dublin is haunted by his words. Let Zurich keep his bones. \u2022 Mark O\u2019Connell is a writer based in Dublin and author of To Be a Machine",

Raised in Stuttgart, Bechtler moved to London in 1970, initially to train in fine art. She then worked in film, and likes the idea that she brings an outsider\u2019s eye to British theatre. \u201cBeing a designer is constantly changing, depending on the people you work with,\u201d she says. \u201cIdeally, you forget everything. Collaborators are crucial, and the skill of the director is in creating the team. I\u2019ve only had one bad experience with a director in my 30-odd years.\u201d Electra Linda Nylind for the Guardian Bechtler\u2019s 1988 production with Deborah Warner and Fiona Shaw of Sophocles\u2019s tragedy for the RSC began a collaboration that continued for a decade. \u201cI wasn\u2019t really familiar with Deborah\u2019s work, but I liked the way she talked. When she asked me about Electra, I had just turned down a film I had been offered. It was a pivotal decision, and very good timing! It led to a very intense 10-year working relationship with her and Fiona.\u201d Natasha Parry as Clytemnestra and Fiona Shaw as Electra at the Pit, Barbican, London, in 1988. Photograph: Neil Libbert \u201cOne of the first things Fiona said was that she might smoke cigarettes, and Deborah said she saw rusty containers. So that immediately means you will not have to go to classical Greece! That was maybe the only conversation we had before I came up with some suggestions. It wasn\u2019t based on big discussions or dissecting the text. It was more an instinctive arrival at something unfathomable.\u201d \u201cLike many people, I had been using the escalators at King\u2019s Cross station after the tube fire, and was very affected by how it still appeared burned. For Electra, I had the idea of the water, ash and an altar. It was to do with essential elements \u2013 I made the walls of this enclosed prison courtyard the colour of ash. The door at the back was real metal, which gave great sound possibilities. And there was a channel of water running to the front of the stage, which eventually ran red with blood.\u201d \u201cI wanted Electra to be dressed in black and showing quite a lot of skin. Fiona cut her hair very short. She looked amazing. She was doing so much physical work, crouching and standing. We cut her dress on one side so that one thigh was exposed.

It\u2019s not life and death \u2013 it\u2019s show business.\u201d Oresteia Photograph: Manuel Harlan Bechtler\u2019s ongoing collaboration with Robert Icke began with his version of the trilogy by Aeschylus at London\u2019s Almeida in 2015. \u201cI hadn\u2019t seen much of Rob\u2019s work, but I sensed something during one of our first conversations. One of the main things we talked about was family. When I think of a German or Italian family especially, I think about sitting around a table and eating together. That was the starting point. I knew the table had to be meaningful, as it was almost the only furniture. There was a nod to Greece in the slightly marble-like material, architectural but built into the Almeida\u2019s own brick.\u201d Photograph: Manuel Harlan \u201cOur innovation was the \u2018electric\u2019 glass, which we could make opaque or transparent at the flick of a switch. I don\u2019t know of a show that had used it before. We felt strongly about looking through to see corridors, other spaces, opening to the bath or the altar. We needed this glass to stage Iphigenia\u2019s death as brutally and shockingly as possible. We took a huge risk \u2013 the glassalmost ate the whole budget, so we had to commit to it. But lots of people use it now.\u201d \u201cMy drafts of the Oresteia included a large video screen. We never used it in this production, but it became completely right for Hamlet at the Almeida. There\u2019s talk of us combining the Oresteia and Hamlet in one world, and making it site-specific to the Armory in New York, which would be an amazing challenge.\u201d Oedipus Photograph: Jan Versweyveld Bechtler and Icke\u2019s version of Sophocles\u2019s tragedy premiered at the Internationaal Theater Amsterdam in 2018 and was staged at the Edinburgh festival in 2019. \u201cOur Oedipus is a politician on election night. We approached the play as being about the feeling that something was coming to an end, that it felt worn out and tired. I came up with an idea where we would have the stage completely filled with the remnants of the old world. It would be packed up during the play, and we\u2019d end up with nothing. When we took the design sketch to the theatre in Amsterdam, we were told that we had massively overestimated our budget! So, literally back to the drawing board. We ended up doing the opposite.\u201d An early model above and a later version below \u201cFortunately, we were with the Toneelgroep company, which has been together for so many years, doing amazing work. It was a revelation. Hans Kesting as Oedipus \u2013 what a phenomenon, what a collaborator.\u201d The Exterminating Angel Photograph: Monika Rittershaus/Salzburg Festival This opera by Thomas Ad\u00e8s, based on Luis Bu\u00f1uel\u2019s film, was directed by Tom Cairns at Salzburg in 2016, before travelling to New York and London. \u201cI\u2019d never designed a contemporary opera on such a big scale. It had to work for the Met in New York, Covent Garden and Salzburg, which have very different prosceniums. The design ended up so simple purely because it went through countless work. I considered far more architectural, enclosed spaces.\u201d \u201cIt was the first time I worked with a company of international singers who not only rehearsed together for weeks, but did so on the built set. They were like an ensemble rehearsing a play.\u201d \u201cBecause the principals could never be off stage, the revolve was used to make sure we always got the action closest to where we needed it. The relevant action always had to be in focus. We used it like a camera to create a closeup. It felt disorienting and queasy, because our big arch on the stage moved independently. It was very creepy.\u201d Photograph: Monika Rittershaus/Salzburg Festival \u201cWe had to make identical versions of each of the characters\u2019 couture-type costumes because they are totally destroyed during the story. We had them made in advance so the singers could wear them in rehearsal and then break them down in the way each felt they should.\u201d The Damnation of Faust Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian Bechtler and Terry Gilliam staged Berlioz\u2019s unwieldy opera for ENO at London\u2019s Coliseum in 2011. \u201cI knew Terry a little bit socially, because my husband, Bill Paterson, was in some of his films, but he didn\u2019t know I was a stage designer. When ENO brought us together, I thought it was a risky idea, because he\u2019s a very distinctive and visual film director. But it became a significant collaboration for me.\u201d Model storyboard for The Damnation of Faust \u201cThe opera is famously difficult to stage. Terry\u2019s version was set in Germany during the first half of the 20th century. I grew up in Stuttgart in the 50s and left in 1970 because I felt burdened by that history. So this was a very important project for me.\u201d \u201cWorking with Terry, I was forced in a direction I would never have gone in. Although you can have any concept you like, opera has rigid musical demands and timings. Unlike film, you can\u2019t simply edit out the bits you don\u2019t like! Terry grasped this, and I would never have produced anything like it with someone else. He was very knowledgeable and incredibly respectful, letting me bring all the visuals to him. The joy of the opera was to work with a great collaborator.\u201d The Almeida\u2019s production of The Doctor, designed by Hildegard Bechtler, is at the Duke of York\u2019s theatre, London, 20 April-11 July 2020.",

For Weingarten, a two-time Pulitzer prize winner for feature writing, the date-from-a-hat gimmick \u2013 mining a random, seemingly ordinary day for its complexities, tracing its refractions into the present \u2013 tested a central conceit in his career as a journalist: \u201cIf you have the patience to find it and the skill to tell it, there\u2019s a story behind everyone and everything,\u201d he writes. \u201cThat although great matters make for strong narratives, power can also lurk in the latent and mundane.\u201d</p> <p>Humble yet profound, One Day is \u201cthe culmination of too many years of work\u201d, Weingarten, 68, joked to the Guardian \u2013 the project ballooned four years past its deadline as Weingarten re-reported stories, chased leads, dead-ended and restarted, and conducted over 500 interviews.

      "bodyText": "I came to understand Australia through drinking milk at the beach. Beach milk. To me, it is more important than the pie, the pav or Vegemite. I grew up largely in south London, in compressed trains and compressed streets, and the whole idea of \u201cAustralia\u201d was about as relatable as outer space. It was an untidy but necessary move here as a kid in the late 1980s, with far fewer anchors than I was ready for. My introduction to Australian life was the glorious red brick suburban panorama of Pascoe Vale. It seemed entirely alien and surreal to me; you had an abundance of dogs, an electric blue sky where the clouds should be, no building ever dared to grow beyond two storeys, and your grass was literally greener. A few days after arrival, shaken by jet lag and your baroque television aesthetics (Tuckerbag, Expo 88, Press Your Luck), I was entrusted to walk around the corner to the \u201cmilk bar\u201d (whatever that was) to buy myself a treat. Through that plastic curtain, across that checkerboard lino, past the rows of those strange chocolate bars, sat three loudly humming fridges. A baritone glass and steel choir promising alien soft drinks and absurd ice-creams. It was on that warm April morning that I experienced my first Egg Flip-flavoured Big M. It felt like passing some kind of delicious test. An initiation. Outside the front of the milk bar, I spied a simple window sticker of the very same thing I was drinking: two lithe figures walking into the sunset surf, with a Big M in the foreground. \u201cWhy are they drinking milk at the beach? Should I be drinking milk at the beach?\u201d My images of Australia had been the same as anybody else\u2019s in England; blazing hot beaches, broad smiles and fruit for miles.

I\u2019m so fucking glad we got Osuna!\u2019 The outburst was offensive and frightening enough that another Houston staffer apologized.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/oct/22/world-series-game-1-washington-nationals-v-houston-astros-live\">World Series Game 1: Washington Nationals 5-4 Houston Astros \u2013 live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While a member of the Toronto Blue Jays last year, Roberto Osuna, the Houston closer, allegedly assaulted the mother of his child. Charges were dropped after the woman decided not to testify, <a href=\"https://www.si.com/mlb/2018/06/22/roberto-osuna-suspension-domestic-violence-toronto-blue-jays\">but MLB suspended Osuna for 75 games</a>. The Astros, Apstein wrote, saw the opportunity to acquire an asset on the cheap, and in trading for the pitcher without giving up much of value, \u201cused assault as a market inefficiency\u201d.</p> <p>The Astros\u2019 initial rebuttal was preposterous, especially since Osuna had pitched poorly and blown a two-run lead: \u201c[Taubman\u2019s] comments had everything to do with the game situation that just occurred and nothing else\u201d. It also accused Sports Illustrated of \u201cfabricating\u201d the story.</p> <p>This was spin in the old-fashioned them-against-us genre, a closing of ranks in the clubhouse - but also a very modern and familiar attempt at media manipulation. Gaslighting instead of apologising; when accused of misconduct, especially by a woman, deny, smear and yell fake news, because truth is fungible now and victory belongs to the brazen.</p> <p>After the account in the article was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HunterAtkins35/status/1186474194772598784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1186474194772598784&amp;ref_url=https://theathletic.com/1313356/2019/10/22/witnesses-confirm-si-report-of-astros-exec-brandon-taubman-yelling-at-female-reporters-about-roberto-osuna/\">corroborated</a> by multiple reporters, Taubman <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/astros/press-release/press-release-10-22-19-astros-statements?t=astros-press-releases\">issued a statement</a> conceding that he \u201cused inappropriate language for which I am deeply sorry and embarrassed\u201d, but insisting that his \u201coverexuberance\u201d was \u201cmisinterpreted\u201d. Astros owner Jim Crane said the team takes domestic violence seriously, while the league equivocally said it would \u201cinterview those involved before commenting further\u201d. There was no apology for the original statement, while Taubman concluded with, \u201cI am sorry if anyone was offended by my actions.\u201d <em>If</em>?</p> <p>For all the brilliance and appeal of star players such as Jose Altuve, George Springer, Carlos Correa, Alex Bregman, and the genial manager, AJ Hinch, the incident has made some wonder if the Astros are auditioning for the role of baseball\u2019s Evil Empire now that the Yankees have endured a decade without reaching the World Series.</p> <p>The episode has left Houston open to accusations that they care little about domestic violence or the truth; that this club, painstakingly built for success <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/oct/24/los-angeles-dodgers-houston-astros-analytics-world-series-baseball\">using cutting-edge data analytics and bold big-money trades</a>, has a culture that marries toxic locker-room banter with boorish arrogance redolent of Silicon Valley\u2019s tech bro excesses.</p> <p>Tuesday\u2019s game, at least, was great fun.

But that rarely-retracted roof helps keep the deafening crowd noise pinging around the ballpark.

      "bodyText": "You can play indoors and still be under a cloud. On the field, the Washington Nationals conjured a surprise victory in the first game of the World Series as the aura of invincibility around the Houston Astros\u2019 Gerrit Cole was punctured by the power of Juan Soto, the 20-year-old slugger. But as one of the finest pitchers in Major League Baseball lost for the first time since 22 May, the fallout lingered from a distasteful off-field episode. Sports Illustrated\u2019s Stephanie Apstein reported that after the American League Championship Series-clinching win over the New York Yankees last Saturday that sent the Astros to the World Series, \u201cassistant general manager Brandon Taubman turned to a group of three female reporters, including one wearing a purple domestic-violence awareness bracelet, and yelled, half a dozen times, \u2018Thank God we got Osuna! I\u2019m so fucking glad we got Osuna!\u2019 The outburst was offensive and frightening enough that another Houston staffer apologized.\u201d While a member of the Toronto Blue Jays last year, Roberto Osuna, the Houston closer, allegedly assaulted the mother of his child. Charges were dropped after the woman decided not to testify, but MLB suspended Osuna for 75 games. The Astros, Apstein wrote, saw the opportunity to acquire an asset on the cheap, and in trading for the pitcher without giving up much of value, \u201cused assault as a market inefficiency\u201d. The Astros\u2019 initial rebuttal was preposterous, especially since Osuna had pitched poorly and blown a two-run lead: \u201c[Taubman\u2019s] comments had everything to do with the game situation that just occurred and nothing else\u201d. It also accused Sports Illustrated of \u201cfabricating\u201d the story. This was spin in the old-fashioned them-against-us genre, a closing of ranks in the clubhouse - but also a very modern and familiar attempt at media manipulation. Gaslighting instead of apologising; when accused of misconduct, especially by a woman, deny, smear and yell fake news, because truth is fungible now and victory belongs to the brazen. After the account in the article was corroborated by multiple reporters, Taubman issued a statement conceding that he \u201cused inappropriate language for which I am deeply sorry and embarrassed\u201d, but insisting that his \u201coverexuberance\u201d was \u201cmisinterpreted\u201d. Astros owner Jim Crane said the team takes domestic violence seriously, while the league equivocally said it would \u201cinterview those involved before commenting further\u201d. There was no apology for the original statement, while Taubman concluded with, \u201cI am sorry if anyone was offended by my actions.\u201d If? For all the brilliance and appeal of star players such as Jose Altuve, George Springer, Carlos Correa, Alex Bregman, and the genial manager, AJ Hinch, the incident has made some wonder if the Astros are auditioning for the role of baseball\u2019s Evil Empire now that the Yankees have endured a decade without reaching the World Series. The episode has left Houston open to accusations that they care little about domestic violence or the truth; that this club, painstakingly built for success using cutting-edge data analytics and bold big-money trades, has a culture that marries toxic locker-room banter with boorish arrogance redolent of Silicon Valley\u2019s tech bro excesses. Tuesday\u2019s game, at least, was great fun. Minute Maid Park is among the best of baseball\u2019s boxes; drawbacks include those carbuncles at the corners, the Chick-fil-A \u201cfowl poles\u201d, and decisions to keep the roof closed even on days such as Tuesday, when the weather is perfect. But that rarely-retracted roof helps keep the deafening crowd noise pinging around the ballpark. So the sound of silence in the rocking orange madhouse was especially striking when Ryan Zimmerman, the first baseman who has been with the Nationals since they emigrated from Montreal in 2005, launched a 413ft home run off Cole in the second inning. Though the Nationals had a week of rest after their 4-0 National League Championship Series stroll past the St Louis Cardinals, the Astros \u2013 winners of the World Series for the first time in 2017 \u2013 entered the series as heavy favourites, with Cole\u2019s imperiousness a big factor. He had allowed a solitary run in his past three postseason starts, all wins. Yet on the biggest stage, he stumbled. Though the Astros raced into a 2-0 lead courtesy of Yuli Gurriel\u2019s two-run double off Max Scherzer in the first inning, their lead was erased by the fourth through Zimmerman and then an even bigger solo blast from Soto, up to the train tracks above left field. After overcoming adversity against the Milwaukee Brewers and Los Angeles Dodgers in previous rounds to give the capital city its first Fall Classic since 1933, there is a zany quality to these Nationals, a subversive streak that complements their obvious talent.

Last year, the Astros traded for reliever Robert Osuna, <a href=\"https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2859296-report-multiple-astros-officials-were-appalled-by-2018-roberto-osuna-trade\">who was serving a 75 game suspension for domestic violence</a>. (The charges were eventually dropped when the woman in question refused to testify, but the league\u2019s investigation determined there was enough there to warrant the suspension.) He has since gone on to become the team\u2019s closer.</p> <p>According to<a href=\"https://www.si.com/mlb/2019/10/22/houston-astros-roberto-osuna-suspension\"> a report by Sports Illustrated\u2019s Stephanie Apstein</a>, a report which was later collaborated by other witnesses, after the Astros Game 6 victory over the Yankees, Astros assistant GM Brandon Taubman turned to a group of female reporters present and yelled \u201cThank God we got Osuna! I\u2019m so f---ing glad we got Osuna!\u201d in a taunting manner. (This, despite the fact that Osuna had actually blown the save in Game 6 and only received a win thanks to Jose Altuve\u2019s walk-off home run.)<br></p> <p>The Astros quickly released a statement <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Chandler_Rome/status/1186468857566941184\">denying that the incident happened as described</a>. Following further corroboration, the Astros then decided that this strategy wasn\u2019t going to work out so today they issued further statements that did little to undo the damage already done. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Feinsand/status/1186714845862907904\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Astros Assistant GM Brandon Taubman and owner Jim Crane have released the following statements: <a href=\"https://t.co/6v5nfXQNCE\">pic.twitter.com/6v5nfXQNCE</a></p>&mdash; Mark Feinsand (@Feinsand) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Feinsand/status/1186714845862907904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 22, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The MLB <a href=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19310459/MLB_Statement_re_Astros_and_Sports_Illustrated_Story_102219.0.pdf\">is now investigating the incident</a>, all but ensuring that we haven\u2019t heard the end of the story.

The Houston Astros were the best team in baseball for a long stretch, winning a ridiculous 107 games, a handful more than the New York Yankees team that they defeated in the American League Championship Series. </p> <p>The Washington Nationals\u2019 93-69 regular season record doesn\u2019t look too bad in a vacuum, but it was only enough for a second place finish in their division and only guaranteed an appearance in the National League Wild Card game. Of course, they beat the Milwaukee Brewers in that game, stunned the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLDS and then swept an inert St Louis Cardinals team on their way to the World Series. Essentially, we\u2019re getting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/21/houston-astros-washington-national-world-series\">the best team in baseball vs. the hottest team in the postseason</a>. </p> <p>How did they get there? Well, it turns out that <a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/2019/10/22/20926157/gerrit-cole-justin-verlander-max-scherzer-stephen-strasburg-world-series-pitching\">starting pitching is somewhat important</a>. Houston has the luxury of putting out Gerrit Cole, Justin Verlander and Zack Greinke as their top three alongside a very potent lineup of hitters. The Nationals are countering with Max Scherzer, Stephen Strasburg, Patrick Corbin and veteran Anibal Sanchez who is on an impressive run. The Nationals bullpen is, well, not quite as good as the Astros\u2019, but it hasn\u2019t mattered much recently. One of the advantages of skipping a Game 5 and 6 is that you don\u2019t have as many innings to hand off to your lesser pitchers.<br></p> <p>So, who has the advantage in this all-important Game 1? Well, Cole and the Astros have the luxury of starting this game at their own stadium but the. Can Washington\u2019s bats find a way to get to Cole and pull off the upset and reclaim home field advantage? </p> <p>Well, we\u2019re about to find out.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s Tom Dart\u2019s thoughts on a tense game - and a tense week for the Astros: Email from Kenneth A Miller: You stand corrected. From Wikipedia, John Marshall Smith (September 27, 1906 - May 9, 1982) was a utility player in Major League Baseball who played briefly for the Boston Red Sox during the 1931 season Okay perhaps Joe Smith doesn\u2019t have the most generic name in baseball history (although he did have the best pitched inning of the game). I did, at the very least, get things right when I said that the Nationals would pull off the upset today. They have to be relieved: if they had managed to lose this game, it would have been nearly impossible to recover from, they couldn\u2019t expect to get five runs off of Cole a second time around. While it\u2019s not the best of circumstances for Houston, they have a solid shot at righting the ship with a win tomorrow where they will have Justin Verlander on the mound. The Guardian will have live coverage of tomorrow\u2019s Game 2, as well as every game for what could be a truly dramatic World Series. This will conclude today\u2019s liveblog however, thanks to everybody who followed along and particularly those who contributed. Ciao! Juan Soto The story of the game has to be Juan Soto, the 20 year old outfielder who went 3-for-4 with a homer and a double and was responsible for three of the five Washington runs. The Washington Nationals have handed Gerrit Cole his first loss since May of this year in Game 1 of the World Series! With the win, they have successfully stolen home field advantage from the Houston Astros. Nationals 5-4 Astros, FINAL And Correa lines out to Robles on one pitch! Sometimes the last three outs end up being the least stressful! Nationals 5-4 Astros, bottom 9th Gurriel is up next. Doolittle\u2019s first two pitches are outside. 2-0. He flies out to Robles on the next pitch. The Nationals are one out away from taking a 1-0 lead in the World Series. Nationals 5-4 Astros, bottom 9th I would imagine the Nationals are hoping that Doolittle can get them three more outs and end this thing here. He has to face Bregman to start things off, which, you know, no pressure. Bregman takes a ball just outside and then a strike that\u2019s just a little bit closer. 1-1. The next pitch? Not so close. 2-1. Doolittle throws a strike right down the middle that Bregman lays off for some reason. 2-2. And\u2026 Bregman strikes out! Two away! BEHIND THE SCENES: I just grabbed a bottle of ice tea because I\u2019m 100% certain that we\u2019re going to be here for a while. This feels like a game destined for extra innings. Nationals 5-4 Astros, top 9th Kurt Suzuki is up next, he takes a strike and then just barely gets out of the way of a ball outside. 1-1. Suzuki fouls the next pitch off. 1-2. Smith, something of a submariner, then gets a strike three call and in an instant there are two out. And in another instant, Robles pops up to short. Can the Astros rally in the bottom of the ninth? Let\u2019s find out! Nationals 5-4 Astros, top 9th Joe Smith, the most generically name major leaguer in baseball history, is up now for the Astros. He will be facing Ryan Zimmerman who grounds out immediately. Nationals 5-4 Astros, bottom 8th The left-handed Doolittle, Baseball Twitter\u2019s unofficial mascot, is in the game to get Brantley. His first pitch is a strike up in the zone. 0-1. He gets a call on the next pitch, a tad borderline perhaps, but it gets the job done. 0-2. Brantley fouls off the next pitch. Still 0-2. Brantley makes good contact on the next pitch but it\u2019s an out to Soto in the outfield. The Nationals are out of the inning, but they are still going to need three more outs. Nationals 5-4 Astros, bottom 8th This one is going extra innings isn\u2019t it? Altuve is on, with Springer on second with just one out. Altuve chases a 1-1 pitch to make it a 1-2. He fouls the next off but just barely. Altuve flies out on the next pitch, which will bring up Brantley. Martinez is out to get Hudson and in comes Sean Doolittle. Nationals 5-4 Astros, bottom 8th Springer is up and he hits one looooong\u2026 NEARLY out of the park but it just barely stays in. Tucker scores and it\u2019s a one run game! Nationals 5-3 Astros, bottom 8th Diaz, still hitless this post season, is here with Tucker on. He flies out, but he does get the runner to second so it\u2019s not unproductive. Nationals 5-3 Astros, bottom 8th Kyle Tucker is in to pinch-hit against Hudson, who I guess the Nationals hope can make it through the eighth. Tucker has other plans as he hits a single. Nationals 5-3 Astros, top 8th It\u2019s up to Cabrera here, that is if Soto doesn\u2019t get caught off the bag as he seems to still have Houston\u2019s attention. Harris\u2019 first pitch to Cabrera is a breaking ball for a strike and his second is fouled off. Washington has one more strike left here in the eighth. Protecting the plate, Cabrera fouls the next pitch off. Still 0-2. Harris throws a pitch that the catcher has to cover. 2-1. Harris\u2019s next pitch is a ball and Soto steals second when the throw goes into the outfield. It doesn\u2019t matter as Cabrera strikes out on the very next pitch. Nationals 5-3 Astros, top 8th Howie Kendrick is up with Soto at first. Given the bullpen, an extra run here would be massive. That\u2019s one of the reasons that Harris is paying attention to Soto at first, worried that he might try to get into scoring position on his lonesome. Soto goes on Kendrick\u2019s swing, but it\u2019s a routine fly and he has to scurry back. Nationals 5-3 Astros, top 8th Juan Soto, the hero of the game, is up here. He falls behind 0-2 quickly but then pokes a single up the middle. Nationals 5-3 Astros, top 8th Righthander Will Harris will be pitching the top of the 8th for Houston, facing Rendon, who hits one in the air to Altuve. Nationals 5-3 Astros, bottom 7th Correa hits an infield single to load the bases. It\u2019s all up to Alvarez here for the Astros. He takes a strike on the outside corner. 0-1. He fouls the next one off. 0-2. Have to expect the next one will be outside here. It is, it\u2019s high, and Alvarez swings any way and makes no contact. Hudson leaves them loaded! Davey Martinez\u2019s gambit pays off! Nationals 5-3 Astros, bottom 7th Daniel Hudson is in to face the dangerous Gurriel. Good for Washington for using their best reliever in what could be the most key moment of the game (although it\u2019s worth wondering where the Nationals go from here). Gurriel fouls back Hudson\u2019s first pitch, takes a pitch and then fouls another one. Hudson\u2019s ahead 2-1 and he gets Gurriel to sky one high for an easy out. Two down in the inning. Nationals 5-3 Astros, bottom 7th Rainey falls behind Bregman 2-0. That\u2019s six straight pitches off the plate. Make that seven. Daniel Hudson warms up with purpose in the bullpen although he\u2019s the nominal closer. Bregman takes a strike. It\u2019s a 3-1 count. The Astros crowd is getting loud. Bregman takes a pitch on a corner for\u2026 a strike. 3-2. Bregman fouls off the next offering. Still 3-2 as the payoff pitch doesn\u2019t pay off. And the next pitch is outside and that\u2019s going to do it for Rainey. Nationals 5-3 Astros, bottom 7th Or, never mind, Rainey walks Brantley on four pitches and here comes Alex Bregman. Nationals 5-3 Astros, bottom 7th Rainey doesn\u2019t seem too rattled as he gets Altuve to strike out on four pitches (and he barely lays off the one ball). Nationals 5-3 Astros, bottom 7th Tanner Rainey comes out of the bullpen (no fans of 1980s political satire, he does not have the number 88). His inning begins with Springer and\u2026 there it is, we have an official Springer Dinger! I never get tired of this. Nationals 5-2 Astros, top 7th Adam Eaton flies one out and Cole finally has a 1-2-3 inning. We\u2019re at the Seventh Inning Stretch! Nationals 5-2 Astros, top 7th Cole falls behind Turner 3-0 before getting a called strike. Turner lunges at a ball just to foul it off. It\u2019s 3-2 and Turner gets into protect-the-plate mode, fouling off two straight Cole pitches as Cole hits the century mark. On pitch 102, Turner strikes out. Nationals 5-2 Astros, top 7th Cole is still in the game, facing Robles. Diaz remains in the game, playing left field as Brantley shifts to right and I don\u2019t even finish getting all that straight before Robles takes his own fascist strikeout. Daniel Stauss: Tom Hanks had the second-best philosophy of baseball. The first, of course, is from Crash Davis: Strikeouts are boring and fascist, ground balls are more democratic. Of course, the writer of \u201cBull Durham\u201d borrowed that particular philosophy from eccentric junkballer Bill Lee who pitched for both the Boston Red Sox and the Montreal Expos a.k.a. the team the Nationals used to be. Nationals 5-2 Astros, bottom 6th Aledmys Diaz comes off the bench to face Corbin with two out and a runner on first. He takes a mighty cut on Corbin\u2019s first pitch, a 94 mph heater. Diaz fouls off the next one and he\u2019s already in a hole. 0-2. He grounds out to second to end the inning. We\u2019re headed to the seventh. Nationals 5-2 Astros, bottom 6th Maldonado is up next and he works a full count before striking out. Nationals 5-2 Astros, bottom 6th Alvarez hits a single on a 2-1 pitch, the Astros have a one-out baserunner. Nationals 5-2 Astros, bottom 6th Corbin\u2019s first batter is Correa and he strikes him out. That\u2019s as good as way as any to introduce one\u2019s self. Nationals 5-2 Astros, top 6th Suzuki flies out and that\u2019s not a real 1-2-3 inning because there was a hit in there, but it\u2019s close enough for me. It\u2019s looking like Corbin is pitching the bottom of the sixth for Washington. Nationals 5-2 Astros, top 6th And Zimmerman immediately grounds into a double play. Man did Cole need that. Nationals 5-2 Astros, top 6th Cole is still in the game for the Astros. Cabrera is at the plate. I love American League games: you get continuity. Until like the seventh and managers try to piece together innings with like four different relievers who throw like two pitches each (stay tuned for that). Cabrera hits a clean single to start things off. Now it\u2019s Houston\u2019s time to start getting their bullpen stirring. The trailer for the Tom Hanks movie about Mr. Rogers comes on which is inconvient because I cannot tear up right out I\u2019m doing a baseball blog and if there\u2019s one thing that Tom Hanks told me about baseball... Nationals 5-2 Astros, bottom 5th Gurriel who is responsible for the Astros runs is up next, possibly as Scherzer\u2019s last hitter of the night. He makes Scherzer work, getting into a 2-2 count and then fouling a few pitches off but he swings and misses to end the inning. Nationals 5-2 Astros, bottom 5th This would be a great time for Bregman to come out of his postseason funk. Meanwhile, starter Patrick Corbin is throwing in the bullpen because Washington doesn\u2019t quite trust their relieving core. Bregman grounds out, but only barely. Zimmerman has to dig out a long throw from short to get the second out of the inning. Nationals 5-2 Astros, bottom 5th Now comes the interesting part: how long does Scherzer stay in the game. If this were a regular season game, the manager might try to get their starter through five so they could get the win. These individual stats are not things that should matter in the World Series but who knows. Scherzer\u2019s out there to start the fifth, at least, with Brantley at the plate. Grantley hits his 99th pitch to Robles. That\u2019s one down in the bottom of the 5th. Nationals 5-2 Astros, top 5th Soto\u2019s on second and Howie Kendrick is at the plate. He nearly drives him home but Correa makes an outstanding diving catch to end the inning. Nationals 5-2 Astros, top 5th Juan Soto has to jump out of the way of Cole\u2019s first pitch. Cole\u2019s second pitch is also well outside. 2-0. The next is even further outside. 3-0. He\u2019s very close to loading the bases. Cole gets a strike on the next pitch to make it 3-1. Soto takes a crazy swing at a changeup and Cole actually could get out of this one. It\u2019s 3-2. Cole doesn\u2019t, Soto takes a sweet swing on a slider and drives in two more runs with a double. Wow! Nationals 3-2 Astros, top 5th Rendon beats out a double play to keep Washington alive. Robles is at third, but there are two outs now. Nationals 3-2 Astros, top 5th Big spot for Adam Eaton who takes a strike that he couldn\u2019t have done much with and then knocks in Suzuki to give the Nationals their first lead of the Series! Nationals 2-2 Astros, top 5th Trea Turner takes a ball that\u2019s way off and then takes a mighty cut just to foul the next offering from Cole. On 1-1 he takes a pitch outside. 2-1. He barely checks a swing on a ball outside. 3-1. He skies one for an out, but at least Suzuki is able to make it to third on the play, so the Nationals can take a lead on an out here. Of course, that requires making contact off of Cole. Nationals 2-2 Astros, top 5th Robles is up next with a runner on first. He\u2019s trying to bunt here and he falls behind 0-2 which serves him right. He decides that it would make more sense to get a base hit, which he does. That\u2019s runners on first and second with nobody out. Do the Nationals have something cooking here? Nationals 2-2 Astros, top 5th Kurt Suzuki, who has been doing a masterful job blocking the plate this game, is up to start the fifth inning. He takes the first ball four that Cole has issued tonight. That was an epic at-bat and it showed you both the strengths and weaknesses of the Astros this postseason: they work counts, they get on base but they don\u2019t always get that big hit. That will probably change when they aren\u2019t, you know, facing Scherzer. Nationals 2-2 Astros, bottom 4th Altuve takes a swing on Scherzer\u2019s first pitch but it\u2019s a foul ball. 0-1. Scherzer\u2019s next pitch is outside, it certainly feels like this could be the biggest at-bat of the game. Scherzer throws a 95 mph heater that Altuve lunges at, man did he need that. 1-2. The next pitch is very low. 2-2. Altuve chops one foul. We\u2019re still at 2-2. Scherzer\u2019s next pitch is outside and it\u2019s 3-2. Good god this is stressful no matter who you are rooting for, to be honest. So of course Altuve just fouls off the next pitch. That\u2019s the seventh of this at-bat alone. The Nationals are not going to get the max out of Scherzer tonight, innings-wise. They\u2019ll settle for getting out of this one. And they do, Altuve chops it back to the pitcher and the inning is finally over. Nationals 2-2 Astros, bottom 4th Scherzer throws two balls to start of Springer. It\u2019s exhausting just to watch his delivery to be honest. He throws a strike to make it 2-1. 85 pitches now. He\u2019s really going to want to get Springer here if he wants to get much farther in this game. His 86th pitch is a ball. Springer has a hitter\u2019s count now but he swings right through a gorgeous breaking ball. 3-2. And it\u2019s a ball. There\u2019s two on now and Altuve is up. Not what you want. Nationals 2-2 Astros, bottom 4th Josh Reddick swings and immediately complains that the bat hit Suzuki\u2019s mitt but umpires fail to call catcher\u2019s interference. A break for Washington. Scherzer\u2019s next two pitches are outside and Reddick pops one up to Soto irritated at the fact that he probably should have been awarded first. Nationals 2-2 Astros, bottom 4th Maldonado shows bunt and falls behind 0-2. I question this strategy. Scherzer throws another ball that Suzuki has to block and then another pitch well outside. It\u2019s 2-2. And then 3-2. 77 pitches now for Scherzer. On pitch 78, Maldonado hits one long but not that long and it\u2019s just the first out. Nationals 2-2 Astros, bottom 4th Alvarez hits a single to start off the fourth. He\u2019s not going to get a 1-2-3 inning in this game, is he? Nationals 2-2 Astros, bottom 4th And Zimmerman strikes out as well. We have a brand new ballgame here, but now the question is how much does Scherzer have in the tank. Nationals 2-2 Astros, top 4th Apparently, Washington hitting coach Kevin Long had called Soto\u2019s home run off of Cole\u2026 yesterday. In any case, Cole isn\u2019t rattled, he gets Cabrera to strike out on three pitches. Zimmerman is up next. Nationals 2-2 Astros, top 4th Howie Kendrick is up next and he hits a fly ball for the inning\u2019s first out. Nationals 2-2 Astros, top 4th Juan Soto is up representing the tying run\u2026 and HE IS THE TYING RUN. He elevates Cole\u2019s second pitch into the atmosphere. I\u2019m not going to say it. I\u2019m not going to say it. I\u2019m not going to say it... Nationals 1-2 Astros, bottom 3rd Robles looks a little bit shook up and now the umpires get into a conference about whether Houston\u2019s third base coach committed interference but they don\u2019t call it. With two runners in scoring position, Correa is up with a chance to do big damage. Instead he swings and misses on what was probably a ball. Scherzer is finally out of the inning. He doesn\u2019t allow any runs but he has been made to work. Nationals 1-2 Astros, bottom 3rd Bregman is up now with one out and one on and he\u2026 strikes out. Still not in a groove it seems. Next comes Gurriel, who had the big hit of the Series so far. This time around\u2026 he hits a flyball that Robles can\u2019t get to. The runners hold up on second and third. Nationals 1-2 Astros, bottom 3rd Brantley gets a piece of a Scherzer cutter and hits a solid single. This is not going to be a quick inning, it seems. Nationals 1-2 Astros, bottom 3rd Altuve\u2019s up to lead off the third, he hits a lazy flyball out as the FOX cameras fixate on the Houston Texans\u2019 J.J. Watt who is in the stands to support the hometown team. Daniel Stauss: In one of the ALCS games (game 5?), Houston was up 5 in the 9th and Alex Bregman worked a 9-pitch at bat for a walk. This is a merciless lineup. It\u2019s weird that they struggled to hit with runners in scoring position during the Yankees series, but maybe that was a side effect of them always getting on base. It\u2019s easy to strand baserunners when you have so many of them. Nationals 1-2 Astros, top 3rd Adam Eaton smokes a single into the outfield, so there\u2019s a man on for Rendon. Cole gets ahead of Rendon 0-2 and he just barely checks his swing on a pitch outside to stay alive. On 1-2, Eaton almost gets picked off. That\u2019s two close-calls. Rendon fouls off Cole\u2019s next two pitches. Rendon hits a long fly but it\u2019s not long enough. Springer is there to catch it and end the threat. Nationals 1-2 Astros, top 3rd Cole throws a looping breaking ball out of the strike zone to Victor Robles who then pops up to Gurriel. That\u2019s a quick start. Turner grounds out almost immediately afterward. The Houston strategy: Nationals 1-2 Astros, bottom 2nd Springer is thinking homer on his first swing, but doesn\u2019t connect and then takes a heater on the bottom half of the plate for strike two. Scherzer tries to get Springer to chase a ball way too wide (or maybe he just misses his spot badly). On 1-2, Scherzer throws a change up that doesn\u2019t catch the plate. 2-2. The next pitch is way outside. Another full count. No matter what happens, we\u2019re going to see the Washington bullpen. He does get a call on a 3-2 pitch to end the inning though. Nationals 1-2 Astros, bottom 2nd Josh Reddick is up next and he takes two balls, Scherzer\u2019s been outside the zone quite a bit this outing so far. On 2-0, Reddick fouls one off and takes ball 3. Scherzer\u2019s up to 40 pitches now, which is what you want to see if you\u2019re rooting for Houston. On 3-1, Reddick fouls another off. And on 3-2, Reddick hits a pop up. Two down and a good chance to get out of this inning without any damage. Unless there is a Springer Dinger. Nationals 1-2 Astros, bottom 2nd Martin Maldonado is up there with a runner on first. Scherzer gets ahead 0-2 and is about to throw a pitch when time is called by\u2026 somebody. Everybody seems annoyed. Scherzer\u2019s next pitch is very wild but Suzuki blocks it and Maldonado hits a harmless flyball for the first out of the inning Nationals 1-2 Astros, bottom 2nd Scherzer is back out there to face Yordan Alvarez who thinks he\u2019s walked on a 3-1 pitch but it\u2019s a pitch right on the corner. He does walk on the very next pitch however. Nationals 1-2 Astros, top 2nd FOX measures the home run at 413 feet. Not a cheapie, in other words. Kurt Suzuki follows it up with a solid at-bat, working a 3-2 count, but he grounds out to short despite nearly beating the tag. Still, a very big inning for Washington. Nationals 1-2 Astros, top 2nd And we\u2019re already at a 2-1 game so maybe my low-scoring game prediction was off. Longtime National Ryan Zimmerman hits a home run and it\u2019s a one-run game. Nationals 0-2 Astros, top 2nd Asdrubal Cabrera is up next, he pops up to the infield. Nationals 0-2 Astros, top 2nd Cole throws a strike to Howie Kendrick who not only is still in the league but has been the Nationals\u2019 most important player. This time around he just grounds out to short. Email from Lafcadio Zuccarello: It\u2019s been two years since I first emailed you about saying Springer-Dinger when he hits a home run. I\u2019m just getting in early this series! Well a walk and a run isn\u2019t quite a home run but it\u2019s worth the same for the Astros. Nationals 0-2 Astros, bottom 1st Carlos Correa is up to bat now, with Gurriel on second. Correa works a full count, Scherzer\u2019s already up to 25 pitches and gets a strikeout on the 26th but Houston has struck first and that may be all that Gerrit Cole needs. Nationals 0-2 Astros, bottom 1st Yuli Gurriel is up next and Scherzer immediately gets ahead of him 0-2. He\u2019s a strike away from getting out of the early jam\u2026 and his next pitch is, uh, not that strike. And Gurriel hits a double that scores two! The Astros are immediately on top! Nationals 0-0 Astros, bottom 1st Scherzer would like a strikeout here, but he throws another pitch that catcher Kurt Suzuki has to block. On 2-2, Bregman strikes out but, on the K, Altuve takes second. Nationals 0-0 Astros, bottom 1st Scherzer gets ahead of Bregman 0-2 and then uncorks a wild pitch that allows Springer to slide into third and now the Astros can score on an out. Nationals 0-0 Astros, bottom 1st Scherzer gets ahead of Michael Brantley 0-2 and then gets Brantley to swing and miss for the first out of the bottom of the 1st. ANd here comes Alex Bergman, to MVP chants. Nationals 0-0 Astros, bottom 1st Jose Altuve picks up right where he left off, scalding a single and the Astros have runners on first and second and nobody out. In a game that could very well be a low-scoring game this could be decided right here and now. Nationals 0-0 Astros, bottom 1st George Springer leads off for Houston against the Nationals\u2019 Max Scherzer and he works a full count walk. So both sides get their leadoff man on. Email from Sammy Lopez Metta Bexar: Being from and in Texas, I suppose I default root for the Astros (even as a Cubs fan)... But I wonder, given all the talk of pitching and bullpen, wouldn\u2019t it be good to have a relief MBMer? Bottom of the 6th, to step in when the going gets too dang long? Considering my many whiffs and errors in the preamble I could have used an Opener for this one. Nationals 0-0 Astros, top 1st Juan Soto comes out with a chance to drive in Turner and instead he flails and leaves Turner at second. The single and stolen base don\u2019t come back to hurt him. , Nationals 0-0 Astros, top 1st Anthony Rendon is up next trying to drive in an early run against Cole. Instead, he strikes out on three straight pitches. Nationals 0-0 Astros, top 1st Eaton attempts to bunt Turner over but instead pops it right up for the first out of the game. Nationals 0-0 Astros, top 1st Trea Turner takes the first pitch for a ball and then hits a single after the second. Then he steals second with Adam Eaton at the plate. There\u2019s a decent start for Houston. Email from Daniel Stauss: I\u2019d like to see the Astros sweep, just to finally shake off the sadness that was 2005, but I don\u2019t see that happening. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll be done in 5, but like any good Houston fan, I can\u2019t ever rule out the possibility of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. I\u2019ll be a wreck until the final out, regardless. I can\u2019t see a sweep as good as Houston has been but five games wouldn\u2019t be shocking. Normally I spend some time here grading the National Anthem but I had t spending a minute to re-finagle the preamble where, as you have pointed out, I somehow traded Gerrit Cole for Max Scherzer in mid-paragraph. I have since fixed, my apologies to all. Email from Patrick Megan: Greetings from Hong Kong. It\u2019s almost 8am, I\u2019ve got my toast and coffee ready for the start of the game but I have a feeling I\u2019ll be here for lunch too. These playoff games are taking longer than NFL games and that\u2019s saying something. Hang in there. This will either be super-quick, like a relatively crisp pitcher\u2019s battle or we\u2019re going to extra innings and it\u2019s going be like four plus hours. No middle ground. Predictions Since this is Game 1, there\u2019s no better time than now to make a series prediction. I have to say that I think the Astros win in six games but, but, the Nationals are going to give them a scare by pulling out a 2-1 win tonight. Expect lots and lots of strikeouts. Agree? Disagree? Feel free to send your predictions this way, either via email (to hunter.felt.freelance@theguardian.com) or Twitter (@HunterFelt). It\u2019s incredibly weird to see Alex Rodriguez and David Ortiz as analysts rather than players. Baseball definitely has a way to make you feel your age. It is, however, great to see Ortiz on the mend after being seriously hurt in a shooting back in June. I\u2019m sure the MLB was hoping for controversy-free World Series, well the Houston Astros have e. Last year, the Astros traded for reliever Robert Osuna, who was serving a 75 game suspension for domestic violence. (The charges were eventually dropped when the woman in question refused to testify, but the league\u2019s investigation determined there was enough there to warrant the suspension.) He has since gone on to become the team\u2019s closer. According to a report by Sports Illustrated\u2019s Stephanie Apstein, a report which was later collaborated by other witnesses, after the Astros Game 6 victory over the Yankees, Astros assistant GM Brandon Taubman turned to a group of female reporters present and yelled \u201cThank God we got Osuna! I\u2019m so f---ing glad we got Osuna!\u201d in a taunting manner. (This, despite the fact that Osuna had actually blown the save in Game 6 and only received a win thanks to Jose Altuve\u2019s walk-off home run.) The Astros quickly released a statement denying that the incident happened as described. Following further corroboration, the Astros then decided that this strategy wasn\u2019t going to work out so today they issued further statements that did little to undo the damage already done. The MLB is now investigating the incident, all but ensuring that we haven\u2019t heard the end of the story. Nor should we. Welcome to the 2019 World Series which, in grand MLB tradition is between a team that pretty much everybody expected to be here and a team that snuck its way in. The Houston Astros were the best team in baseball for a long stretch, winning a ridiculous 107 games, a handful more than the New York Yankees team that they defeated in the American League Championship Series. The Washington Nationals\u2019 93-69 regular season record doesn\u2019t look too bad in a vacuum, but it was only enough for a second place finish in their division and only guaranteed an appearance in the National League Wild Card game. Of course, they beat the Milwaukee Brewers in that game, stunned the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLDS and then swept an inert St Louis Cardinals team on their way to the World Series. Essentially, we\u2019re getting the best team in baseball vs. the hottest team in the postseason. How did they get there? Well, it turns out that starting pitching is somewhat important. Houston has the luxury of putting out Gerrit Cole, Justin Verlander and Zack Greinke as their top three alongside a very potent lineup of hitters. The Nationals are countering with Max Scherzer, Stephen Strasburg, Patrick Corbin and veteran Anibal Sanchez who is on an impressive run. The Nationals bullpen is, well, not quite as good as the Astros\u2019, but it hasn\u2019t mattered much recently. One of the advantages of skipping a Game 5 and 6 is that you don\u2019t have as many innings to hand off to your lesser pitchers. So, who has the advantage in this all-important Game 1? Well, Cole and the Astros have the luxury of starting this game at their own stadium but the. Can Washington\u2019s bats find a way to get to Cole and pull off the upset and reclaim home field advantage? Well, we\u2019re about to find out. If you would like to contribute to the blog, you can email your thoughts to hunter.felt.freelance@theguardian.com or tweet them to @HunterFelt throughout the next few hours and we\u2019ll include them in this liveblog along the way. It\u2019s Game 1 of the 2019 World Series at Minute Maid Park. First pitch is scheduled around 8:08pm EST but we\u2019ll be back well before then. Hunter will be here shortly, in the meantime here\u2019s how the two teams are shaping up before tonight\u2019s game:",

But decades later, a thorough reckoning has still not been had. The recommendations of Liberia\u2019s Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), published in 2009, have <a href=\"https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/analysis/2019/06/24/liberia-sierra-leone-post-war-justice\">never been implemented</a>, and former rebels and their associates have held some of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/13/liberian-civil-war-warlord-lawsuit\">country\u2019s highest offices</a>.</p> <p>The country\u2019s president, George Weah, appears to be changing tack, however, <a href=\"https://frontpageafricaonline.com/news/liberia-president-seeks-legislatures-advice-for-war-crimes-court/\">writing to parliament</a> in September to ask for advice on implementing the TRC recommendations including setting up the war crimes court that activists have long demanded, and telling the UN the country needs \u201cclosure\u201d on the wounds of 14 years of war \u2013 though he <a href=\"https://frontpageafricaonline.com/liberia-war-crimes-trial/liberia-pres-weah-casts-uncertainty-over-his-support-for-establishment-of-war-crimes-court/\">stopp</a><a href=\"https://frontpageafricaonline.com/liberia-war-crimes-trial/liberia-pres-weah-casts-uncertainty-over-his-support-for-establishment-of-war-crimes-court/\">ed short</a> of openly supporting the establishment of the war crimes court.</p> <p>Dennis has been instrumental in pushing for a resolution on a bill calling for the establishment of such a court, hailed as one of Liberia\u2019s first steps towards addressing the legacy of the civil wars.</p> <p>\u201cI feel all those souls that were lost \u2013 we should account for it,\u201d she says. \u201cIf we don\u2019t hold perpetrators accountable, we will have another war.

      "bodyText": "As a child in Liberia\u2019s first civil war, Rustonlyn Dennis remembers seeing dead bodies in the street. In 1991, her immediate family managed to get out of the shattered capital, Monrovia, and survived, but a dozen relatives starved to death. Civilians were attacked, child soldiers recruited and ethnic groups were targeted in that war, setting a pattern for many of the wars that were to follow on the African continent. Hundreds of thousands of people died. Like Dennis, now a legislator in the west African country\u2019s parliament, most Liberians have a war story to tell. But decades later, a thorough reckoning has still not been had. The recommendations of Liberia\u2019s Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), published in 2009, have never been implemented, and former rebels and their associates have held some of the country\u2019s highest offices. The country\u2019s president, George Weah, appears to be changing tack, however, writing to parliament in September to ask for advice on implementing the TRC recommendations including setting up the war crimes court that activists have long demanded, and telling the UN the country needs \u201cclosure\u201d on the wounds of 14 years of war \u2013 though he stopped short of openly supporting the establishment of the war crimes court. Dennis has been instrumental in pushing for a resolution on a bill calling for the establishment of such a court, hailed as one of Liberia\u2019s first steps towards addressing the legacy of the civil wars. \u201cI feel all those souls that were lost \u2013 we should account for it,\u201d she says. \u201cIf we don\u2019t hold perpetrators accountable, we will have another war. People fought the war because of corruption, nepotism and greed. These things are happening again.\u201d Dennis says she has faced threats from former warlords because of her fight to bring perpetrators of past human rights violations to justice. Momentum has built, with groups such as the Traditional Chiefs Council gradually coming on board. One of the recommendations of a recently held three-day National Economic Dialogue was to set up the court. At least 52 lawmakers signed the resolution, giving it the requisite support of two-thirds of the House of Representatives. However, recently the Speaker refused to include it on the House agenda, saying that members needed more time to consult their constituents. The country\u2019s Nobel prize-winning former president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, did not act on the TRC\u2019s recommendations, including one that she, along with others, should not hold office for 30 years due to her support for war criminal-turned-president Charles Taylor early in his career. Initially Weah showed every sign of following Sirleaf\u2019s lead, despite having called for justice for those who recruited child soldiers 15 years ago. Addressing the UN in September, however, Weah said he had changed his mind because of a \u201crising chorus of voices\u201d calling for a tribunal, including, he said, \u201calleged perpetrators who seem to wish to clear their names\u201d. Although he said he was at a loss to understand why there was such clamour for the court now and not before, he said: \u201cIt is important to bring closure to the wounds from the 14 years of Liberia\u2019s brutal civil war \u2026 we need to agree on a mechanism that will guarantee the sustenance of peace, stability, justice and reconciliation.\u201d Returning to Liberia from the UN general assembly, however, Weah appeared to backtrack, saying that he had merely informed the UN about the calls for a court, not supported one himself. \u201cI have never one day called for the war-crimes court,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy should we focus on the war crimes court now, when we did not focus on it 12 years ago?\u201d To win the 2017 election, Weah relied on the support of Prince Johnson, a warlord-turned-senator who was involved in the killing of the brutal former military ruler Samuel Doe on camera. Fear of upsetting Johnson, and his many supporters, may have been the reason Weah did not act sooner. Johnson argues a war crimes court would be illegal, though he has said he supports Weah\u2019s request for advice on it from the legislature. People claiming to speak on behalf of Prince Johnson have issued threats to Dennis. She says \u201csince then, there has been this unknown or unlicensed black vehicle that is always tailing me.\u201d Johnson denied any involvement in phone calls to Dennis, adding that he is now a preacher and \u201cvehemently condemn[s] any form of violence against people\u201d. Dennis says she has also received direct threats from other high-profile figures. \u201cI will get to you, and those who sent you will regret [it],\u201d Dennis says she was told in one phone call. Nevertheless, she believes it is a cause worth fighting for. \u201cI just want to walk in light, I just want to walk in justice, and I stand for justice,\u201d she says. \u201cI think the time to be afraid is over, I think they [the warlords] should be afraid now.\u201d It would help the country economically, she says, because nobody wants to invest in a \u201ctotally lawless\u201d country. The economy has sunk since Weah took over in 2017. If there is no accountability, she says, history will repeat itself. \u201cHow sure are we that another group of people will not rise up again for political power? If we don\u2019t set a precedent, there will always be bloodshed, there will always be killing, there will always be murders.\u201d",

The North\u2019s ruler said it was a \u201cmistake\u201d for the resort, on the east coast, to be regarded as the common property of two Koreas given its location on North Korean soil, according to the state news agency KCNA. \u201cMount Kumgang is our land won at the cost of blood and even a cliff and a tree on it are associated with our sovereignty and dignity,\u201d Kim said during a visit to the resort this week, KCNA reported, adding that he thought South Korean facilities were \u201creminiscent of temporary buildings at construction sites\u201d.

The resort, built with investment from South Korean firms, has since hosted occasional reunions of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean war. Pyongyang is reported to have been angered by South Korea\u2019s failure to resume the tours, amid stalled negotiations over Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes The regime has pushed Seoul to ignore US objections to greater inter-Korean cooperation, but any South Korean investment in Kumgang would violate international sanctions imposed on Pyongyang. Kumgang, along with the now-closed Kaesong industrial complex just north of the countries\u2019 heavily armed border, was once seen as an example of what they could achieve despite military and political tensions. The South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, has raised the prospect of resuming tours to Kumgang in an attempt to restart inter-Korean cooperation. During their summit in Pyongyang in September 2018, Moon and Kim agreed to resume tours to Kumgang and reopen Kaesong \u201cas soon as the environment is created\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The New South Wales police watchdog is reviewing whether it is legal for officers to force people to squat during a strip search. On Wednesday, the commissioner of the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission, Michael Adams QC, told an inquiry into the use of strip search powers by police that he was considering whether the practice was legal. The LECC is currently investigating the use of strip-search powers by the NSW police and the allegedly unlawful search of a 16-year-old girl at the 2018 Splendour in the Grass festival. It is alleged the girl was strip-searched at the event without a parent or guardian present, a breach of police search powers. The inquiry has heard the girl, who cannot be named, was left fearful and in tears after she was forced to strip naked and squat in front of a police officer who then \u201clooked underneath\u201d her. Police in NSW commonly force people to squat when being subjected to a strip search. In September, the police published a new personal search manual for the first time which allows officers to instruct people to squat, lift their testicles or breasts, or part their buttock cheeks. On Tuesday, the officer who conducted the search on the 16-year-old \u2013 but says she does not remember conducting it \u2013 gave evidence she commonly instructed people to turn around and squat, before herself bending down \u201cto see if they have got anything inserted inside them in their vagina or anus\u201d. The officer denied looking underneath people but said she examined them \u201cat a distance\u201d. On Wednesday, Adams revealed the commission was considering whether it was legal for police to instruct people to squat, saying it had not been \u201cthe subject of specific decisions of the courts\u201d. \u201cThe question of whether this is lawful is a matter of present considerations and will be considered in the course of this investigation,\u201d Adams said. \u201cIt has not been the subject of specific decisions of the courts and is a matter on which this commission will make a determination or recommendation in due course, assisted by, as I expect submissions to be made by the commissioner of police. \u201cBut squatting is not the only problematic area in strip searches that requires greater clarification.\u201d The officer was questioned at length on Tuesday and Wednesday about how she came to know she was permitted to ask people to squat during a strip-search. She had initially said it was in the NSW police handbook \u2013 which is incorrect \u2013 and later referred to the personal search manual, which was not published until after the 2018 Splendour in the Grass festival. On Wednesday, she said she wasn\u2019t sure when she was trained to do it but that it may have been during her training at the police academy. \u201cThat is how I have been trained to search and [how] I\u2019ve always done it,\u201d she said.",

Ahmad would normally wake at 7am and go to the gym before working from 10am till 6pm. \u201cNow, I can\u2019t sleep until 2am,\u201d he said. \u201cI sleep during daytime because there is nothing to do. [The] gym is also shut.\u201d He has been taking sleeping pills for the last seven weeks and is having nightmares. \u201cI fear getting arrested, then what will happen to my family? Or if I am hit by bullets or a teargas shell. I didn\u2019t expect [the clampdown] to be so long and uncertain.\u201d According to a 2015 survey by M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, nearly 1.8 million adults in Kashmir \u2013 45% of the population \u2013 have shown symptoms of mental distress. More than 41% of the population showed signs of depression, 26% signs of anxiety and 19% showed probable symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Dr Aijaz Ahmad Khan, a clinical psychologist at the SMHS mental clinic, believes the situation is getting worse. \u201cA week after August 5, we saw a change in the patients. We started having patients who had psychological disturbances. It is increasing since then,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is emotional numbness and it is increasing.\u201d He said at least 10% of patients have complaints directly related to the clampdown. A year ago, about 70 to 80 patients visited the Srinagar clinic, but Khan said it was now seeing 130 to 150 a day. The fragile situation in Kashmir has severely affected women, who have fewer opportunities to venture outside. Romana, 22, from Pulwama, said she was suffering paranoia. \u201cI was feeling sick while at home,\u201d said Romana, a computer studies student. \u201cIf a person wants to go somewhere, you can\u2019t. People are panicked, so am I \u2026 I feel scared.\u201d Romana\u2019s prescription says her situation has escalated \u201cdue to the curfew\u201d. Zoya Mir, a clinical psychology student at the Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences in Srinagar, is worried about the future. \u201cWe have become resilient to pain, feelings, and emotions,\u201d said Mir, who has experienced panic attacks. \u201cThere will be a point where it will be beyond repair.\u201d People do not communicate with their families or each other because there is nothing positive to say, added Mir. Even if there was, mobile and internet services remain suspended for millions. Landlines, though apparently restored, are unreliable. As the shadows in the hospital grew longer, Ruhi and Ahmad decided to drive back home together. \u201cIn the car, we will decide our next meeting,\u201d said Ruhi. \u201cWe will meet again now, soon.\u201d Some names have been changed",

They are both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2017/nov/30/donald-trump-sexual-misconduct-allegations-full-list\">extreme, really gross examples</a> of what happens when there\u2019s an unchecked accumulation of power.</p> <p>\u201cBut previously with both men the behaviour wasn\u2019t even called out. We could not identify it because nobody talked about it. People wouldn\u2019t join those who wanted to fight.</p> <p>\u201cSo I think it\u2019s important to acknowledge the fact that these men are not just being allowed to behave that way without any consequences, even if the consequence is just being accused and called out. The fact of the matter is we have a lot of work to do and a long way to go. But what #MeToo has done is sort of blow up an old paradigm and make space for this new one that is more inclusive, and more expansive. Now we can raise our voices, we can galvanise, and that\u2019s a phenomenal leap from where we were 30 years ago.</p> <p>\u201cIf it\u2019s possible to galvanise people starting with a hashtag, to get them to stand up and raise their voices and be counted and be a part of this global community, then so much more is possible.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018The vision has not changed\u2019</h2> <p>Burke\u2019s work began on the streets, helping girls across the US heal from and share their stories of sexual violence at the hands of their friends, family members, carers and strangers in a program of empathy she called Me Too. She is now 46 and the senior director of Girls for Gender Equity in Brooklyn. Despite her public profile, Burke insists her work now is not far removed from where it began in Alabama decades ago.</p> <p>\u201cBack then<em> </em>I was doing this out of my living room, just trying to think of strategy and trying to think of what could make it so that people understood that we have to collectively address sexual violence,\u201d Burke says.</p> <p>\u201cAnd in my lifetime, before I close my eyes, I\u2019m accepting awards in Australia and talking to people in other countries about the very same vision. The vision has not changed, which for me has always been about creating communities for survivors where they can find their own way to healing and activating folks to be leaders in the movement against sexual violence. Nothing about that has changed, but we just have way more people to talk to now.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/14/metoo-two-years-weinstein-allegations-tip-of-iceberg-accusers-zelda-perkins-rosanna-arquette\">#MeToo two years on: Weinstein allegations 'tip of iceberg', say accusers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Towards the top of her list of people to talk to about sexual violence are US voters.

To not hear a response from the people who want to be in leadership in this country is super problematic. So we\u2019ve created a new hashtag, called #MeTooVoter.\u201d</p> <p>Burke believes sexual violence should be addressed by politicians and the media as a public health crisis. If a disease broke out tomorrow affecting millions of people globally, \u201cthe world would literally stop\u201d, she says.</p> <p>\u201cThere would be non-stop coverage asking: what is this disease that everybody has? How did we not see it coming? How did we get here? Where did it come from? You have people that cross every demographic you can think of whose lives are affected by this thing. And that means those people are voters and taxpayers. And I mean, politicians, they\u2019re accountable to us.</p> <p>\u201cThe second thing right behind that question people would be asking is, well, how do we stop it? And then the very next question would be, how do we make sure that we never end up here again?\u201d</p> <p>It is that last question that has Burke\u2019s attention. She wants to explore and expose the roots of sexual violence, which she says can differ between countries and cultures. She is having conversations with #MeToo campaigns in Africa, Sweden and India to understand how the public and policymakers are responding to sexual harassment.</p> <h2>Building a diverse and inclusive movement</h2> <p>Burke will receive the annual Sydney peace prize alongside the Australian author and broadcaster Tracey Spicer, who was part of a Walkley award-winning team that exposed <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/a-highgrade-twisted-abuser-don-burke-a-sexual-harasser-and-bully-claims-series-of-women-20171126-gzt6d2.html\">multiple allegations of sexual harassment and bullying by the Australian TV personality Don Burke</a>.</p> <p>Spicer was elevated to a spokeswoman in Australia for the #MeToo movement thanks to her role in the investigation and public call-out for women to disclose their experiences of sexual harassment.

      "bodyText": "A 20-year-old University of Queensland student is taking the Chinese government\u2019s most senior representative in the state to court over allegations the consul general accused him of anti-Chinese separatism and exposed him to death threats. Drew Pavlou\u2019s claim before the court argues the consul general of the People\u2019s Republic of China in Brisbane, Dr Xu Jie, who is also an adjunct professor at the university, accused Pavlou in a formal statement of \u201cseparatist activities\u201d \u2013 a capital crime in China \u2013 and incited death threats against him. Pavlou, recently elected to the University of Queensland Senate, has made an application under Queensland\u2019s Peace and Good Behaviour Act seeking a retraction of the comments and an apology. Xu has been summoned to appear in the Brisbane magistrates court on 22 November to respond to the complaint. Pavlou, an outspoken supporter of Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy protests, was a key organiser of a July demonstration at UQ in support of Hong Kong. The rally attracted a violent response from pro-Chinese government students, with Pavlou telling the Guardian he was assaulted twice. Pavlou was identified by name in the Global Times \u2013 a state-owned and communist party controlled newspaper \u2013 and in Chinese-language Australian media as a key organiser of the rally. The next day Xu posted a formal statement on the consul general website praising students who responded with \u201cself-motivated patriotic behaviour\u201d and condemning the protest as \u201canti-China separatist activities\u201d. The post read: \u201cA small number of people with ulterior motives carried out anti-China activists at the University of Queensland in Australia, causing indignation and protests from overseas Chinese students of the mainland and Hong Kong. \u201cThe consulate general regards highly the importance of the safety of the overseas Chinese students and affirms the self-motivated patriotic behaviour of the overseas Chinese students. The consulate general resolutely opposes to [sic] any conduct by words or behaviour to split the country \u2026 and to incite anti-China behaviour.\u201d Separatism is a capital crime in China, listed as a crime \u201cendangering national security\u201d in the criminal code, alongside treason, espionage and selling state secrets. Pavlou told the Guardian following the publication of the consul general\u2019s statement his social media accounts were flooded with abuse, warnings of violence and death threats. \u201cI do feel scared for my safety,\u201d Pavlou said. \u201cThe campaign against me is very aggressive, very organised and very personal. People have posted images of me saying, \u2018This is Drew Pavlou, he\u2019s an anti-China separatist\u2019. I have received death threats, threats of violence. I don\u2019t feel safe on campus and I feel like they are trying to intimidate me into being silent.\u201d He said the threats against him were escalating. This week, the Lennon Wall at UQ \u2013 a designated protest space at the university \u2013 was vandalised, and a poster of Pavlou posted with the words \u201cDon\u2019t insult Chinese\u201d written across it. Pavlou said his court application sought an unreserved apology from the consul general. \u201cI want him to retract his statement [and] to apologise \u2026 This has left me fearful for my safety.\u201d Pavlou said in the aftermath of the consul general\u2019s post, the University of Queensland had also asked him to remove anti-China social media posts and told him his enrolment is \u201cunder review\u201d. He has written to UQ asking that the university donate his entire $50,000 salary \u2013 for a two-year term as university senator \u2013 to Amnesty International to assist its work protecting and advocating for members of the oppressed Uyghur Muslim minority in China\u2019s Xinjiang province. Pavlou said he had been approached by some international students at UQ from mainland China who said they agreed with his support for Hong Kong protestors, but that they were afraid to join demonstrations, post on the Lennon Wall, or even be seen talking with Pavlou because they were fearful of retribution. In the days immediately following Xu\u2019s comments, Australia\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, warned that Australia expected foreign diplomats to respect Australia\u2019s rights to free speech and lawful protest, \u201ceven on contentious and sensitive issues\u201d. \u201cThe government would be particularly concerned if any foreign diplomatic mission were to act in ways that could undermine such rights, including by encouraging disruptive or potentially violent behaviour.\u201d The Guardian sought comment from the consul general through the Chinese embassy in Australia regarding Pavlou\u2019s court application, but received no reply. In an earlier statement, the embassy defended Xu\u2019s comments. \u201cWe believe that the remarks made by the spokesperson of the consulate general of the People\u2019s Republic of China in Brisbane on July 25th are appropriate and measured. Any misinterpretation of and over-reaction to the remarks are regrettable and unacceptable.\u201d Pavlou\u2019s lawyer Mark Tarrant said the consul general\u2019s statement carried an extraordinary accusation. \u201cFor a government official to make a statement that the organisers of this protest are engaged in separatism, a capital crime, and for that statement [to be] carried in the Global Times \u2013 a state organ \u2013 is unacceptable.\u201d Tarrant said Pavlou had been left vulnerable because of institutional failures to protect his democratic rights. \u201cHe\u2019s only 20 and nobody\u2019s protecting him. The idea is to go to an independent court for the protection of Drew\u2019s right to peaceful protest. We are looking for the court to uphold the rule of law, and protect this student\u2019s fundamental rights. Nobody else is protecting him. The police won\u2019t protect him, the government won\u2019t.\u201d The Guardian approached the University of Queensland for comment. In a statement online, the university said Xu\u2019s nomination as adjunct professor was supported by the school of languages and cultures, and he will remain an adjunct professor until December 2021. \u201cThe university has no plans for Dr Xu to teach,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIn light of the changing geo-political situation, UQ is continuing to monitor and amend policies and practices in a reasonable and responsible way.\u201d The UQ Senate resolved last month that no serving foreign government officials would be offered honorary or adjunct positions. Existing appointments would not be renewed or extended.",

The prime minister, Scott Morrison, and Paul Fletcher, the minister for the arts, announced the awards at a ceremony in Canberra on Wednesday. The suite of awards offers a prize pool of $600,000, with $80,000 for the winner of each category and $5,000 for each shortlisted author. The other shortlistees for the fiction prize were Rodney Hall\u2019s A Stolen Season, Suneeta Peres da Costa\u2019s Saudade, Laura Elizabeth Woollett\u2019s Beautiful Revolutionary, and Miles Franklin award winner Melissa Lucashenko\u2019s Too Much Lip. Jones\u2019 book has already received wide acclaim: The Death of Noah Glass was longlisted for the 2019 Stella prize and shortlisted for the Miles Franklin. Jones described the book to the Guardian last year as \u201ca novel full of images\u201d. \u201cThese stories are braided to suggest the mystery of families \u2013 the way they share a culture, sayings, habits and memories, while parents and children are essentially unknown to each other,\u201d she said. The Death of Noah Glass pivots around the life of an art historian, his artist son Martin, and his one-time philosopher daughter Evie. Each of the characters follows the journeys of another through Europe on a quest to understand them better. Paul Genoni and Tanya Dalziell\u2019s history of artists living on the Greek island of Hydra between 1955 and 1964, Half the Perfect World, took out the non-fiction prize. Presentations of the awards at the Canberra event were interrupted by a division in the House, with the journalist Annabel Crabb taking over presenting duties from the prime minister as he left to vote. Prizes were also awarded to writers of history, poetry, young adult and children\u2019s literature. Meredith Lake\u2019s cultural history of The Bible in Australia won the prize for Australian history. Judith Beveridge\u2019s Sun Music took out the poetry prize. The longtime writer for young people, Emily Rodda, won the prize for children\u2019s literature with His Name Was Walter, while Michael Gerard Bauer was awarded the prize for young adult literature for The Things That Will Not Stand. \u201cWe are fortunate to have such remarkable authors, poets, illustrators, creators and historians committed to bringing Australian stories to life,\u201d Morrison said in a statement.

      "bodyText": "Two members of the far-right Proud Boys were sentenced Tuesday to four years in prison for their roles in a street fight after a speech last year at New York\u2019s Metropolitan Republican Club. Judge Mark Dwyer said the lengthy sentences were necessary to deter people from engaging in what he called \u201cpolitical street brawls\u201d. The brawl reminded him of political street violence that went unchecked in Europe in the 1930s, fueling the rise of fascism, Dwyer said. The criminal justice system must act as a check on political violence, he argued, \u201cespecially at this time in the country when people are so divided\u201d. Dwyer also had harsh words for the Proud Boys founder, Gavin McInnes, a high-profile media entrepreneur who previously co-founded Vice Media. McInnes claimed that he had quit the Proud Boys a month after the clash outside the Metropolitan Republican Club, where he had been speaking. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame when some people jump up and down on a platform, and their followers, their soldiers, get into trouble,\u201d Dwyer said, in an apparent reference to McInnes, the New York Post reported. For the past three years, law enforcement officials in cities across the country have faced sharp criticism for failing to act as a check on street violence by far-right groups, despite repeated public brawls and evidence that members of the groups prepare and plan for violent confrontations. From Charlottesville to Berkeley to Sacramento to Portland, police have sometimes failed to intervene in street fights, or chosen not to file charges against neo-Nazis and other far-right activists, even when well-documented assaults occur in public. The New York police department faced similar criticism last year after making no immediate arrests of Proud Boys after violence outside the Metropolitan Republican Club event, despite graphic video footage of protesters being beaten, Buzzfeed News reported at the time. New York officials, including the state governor, Andrew Cuomo, responded by publicly calling for arrests and prosecution, arguing that there should be no tolerance for violence fueled by hatred. Maxwell Hare, 27, and John Kinsman, 40, were convicted in August on charges stemming from the October 2018 fight between members of the Proud Boys and anti-fascists, known as Antifa. The trial was unusual in that no victims testified because they are not cooperating with police. Instead, prosecutors relied heavily on video, including security camera footage that showed Proud Boys members starting the fight. Hare and Kinsman apologized Tuesday. Their lawyers have said they acted in self-defense when a masked protester threw a bottle. Members of the Proud Boys and groups that were protesting McInnes\u2019 speech were then seen kicking and punching each other on the sidewalk. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about the whole mess. I regret the entire incident,\u201d said Kinsman, a married father of three from Morristown, New Jersey. Hare, from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, said he \u201cmade a mistake that night\u201d and blamed hasty decision making for his part in the melee. Ten members and associates of the Proud Boys were arrested in the days following the clash. Hare and Kinsman were the first two to go on trial. The Southern Poverty Law Center, an organization that monitors American hate groups, has designated the Proud Boys as a hate group. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has labeled the Proud Boys as an \u201cextremist group with ties to white nationalism\u201d, according to law enforcement officials in Washington state. The Proud Boys made headlines last week when the police chief in East Hampton, Connecticut ruled that an officer\u2019s membership in the group didn\u2019t violate department policies.",

      "bodyText": "David Beckham\u2019s nascent Major League Soccer club have unveiled plans for their new $966m stadium ahead of their entrance to the league for the 2020 season. Inter Miami have shared artist\u2019s renditions of the sprawling commercial and stadium complex which they expect to be completed by 2022, including such glitzy flourishes as a rooftop bar and palm trees on the roof. In the meantime Inter Miami will play in Lockhart is where the MLS\u2019 Miami Fusion played from 1998-2001, eventually folding because of poor attendance. The delay is due in large part to an analysis first reported by the Miami Herald that found arsenic contamination reaching more than twice the legal limit and hazardous debris in surface-level soil samples at the Melreese golf course, where people have played for more than 50 years. The environmental firm EE&amp;G, hired by Inter Miami, took more than 140 soil samples in recent months. Apart from the arsenic, it found barium and lead levels above legal limits \u201cOrganized chaos,\u201d Inter Miami sporting director Paul McDonough said this week as he took a look around the site of the now-demolished Lockhart Stadium where work on the new complex is happening 12 hours a day, seven days a week. \u201cBut we\u2019ll be ready.\u201d At any given time, there are about 225 workers on the job site \u2013 the whereabouts of all of them tracked with an app that gets data from a chip attached to the back of their hard hats. If there\u2019s lightning in the area, work gets halted for 30 minutes until the cell passes. And that\u2019s a big deal, because even with next season still months away every minute counts. Nothing is ready, yet \u2013 but it will be. \u201cThe way it was built out, we\u2019re thinking of the athlete first from the minute they walk in,\u201d said Jacklyne Ramos, the team\u2019s vice president of communications as she stood inside what will be the building containing the locker room and other key spaces for the team. \u201cThe main stadium, that\u2019s for the games. Where we are now, this is where they\u2019ll live.\u201d The Associated Press got a tour on Monday of what will be Inter Miami\u2019s inaugural home.

      "body": "<p>A Honduran woman living in Connecticut has accused a US immigration agent of sexually assaulting her over a period of seven years under the threat of deportation, according to a federal lawsuit. </p> <p>The woman, identified in the lawsuit as Jane Doe, sued the US Department of Homeland Security, the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), and the former Ice agent Wilfredo Rodriguez on Saturday, seeking $10m in damages.</p> <p>\u201cMy only comment is that my client had a choice: cooperate with Ice or be deported with her family,\u201d said George Kramer, the woman\u2019s lawyer. \u201cShe remains in a very fragile psychological state. She is not only seeking compensation for the physical and emotional damage she suffered but to change the way those who are cooperating with Ice are treated by those in a position of power and who often wield total control over the ability to remain in the United States.\u201d</p> <p>An Ice spokesman told the Associated Press he couldn\u2019t comment on litigation but confirmed Rodriguez no longer works for the agency. Homeland security didn\u2019t immediately return a call seeking comment.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/27/migrant-children-sexual-abuse-complaints-filed-documents-hhs\">Thousands of migrant children allegedly sexually abused in US custody</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was not immediately clear whether Rodriguez had a lawyer to speak for him, and a phone listing for him could not immediately be found, according to the AP.</p> <p>Tom Carson, a spokesman for the US attorney\u2019s office in Connecticut, told the AP he could not comment on whether there has been or will be a criminal investigation.</p> <p>The woman first met the Ice agent in 2006 after her brother was arrested for entering the US illegally, according to the lawsuit.</p> <p>Rodriguez found out she was also living in the country illegally and said that to avoid deportation she would have to become an informant by helping Ice locate criminals. According to the lawsuit she did so, but, in 2007, Rodriguez sexually assaulted her in a motel.</p> <p>He called himself the \u201cwolf\u201d and said he was the reason she and her family weren\u2019t deported, she says in the lawsuit.</p> <p>The woman alleges that the assaults continued and resulted in three pregnancies, each followed by abortions, one of which Rodriguez paid for. </p> <p> Later, he told her that he was leaving the agency but that if she told anyone what happened, \u201cshe and her family would pay\u201d, according to the lawsuit.</p> <p>The woman finally told her story last year when her father, living in the US and fearing deportation because of her friendliness with Ice, applied for asylum. She opened up to an agent who approached her about her father\u2019s application, the lawsuit says.</p> <p>The agent, she says, suggested she consult an attorney. </p>",

      "bodyText": "A Honduran woman living in Connecticut has accused a US immigration agent of sexually assaulting her over a period of seven years under the threat of deportation, according to a federal lawsuit. The woman, identified in the lawsuit as Jane Doe, sued the US Department of Homeland Security, the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), and the former Ice agent Wilfredo Rodriguez on Saturday, seeking $10m in damages. \u201cMy only comment is that my client had a choice: cooperate with Ice or be deported with her family,\u201d said George Kramer, the woman\u2019s lawyer. \u201cShe remains in a very fragile psychological state. She is not only seeking compensation for the physical and emotional damage she suffered but to change the way those who are cooperating with Ice are treated by those in a position of power and who often wield total control over the ability to remain in the United States.\u201d An Ice spokesman told the Associated Press he couldn\u2019t comment on litigation but confirmed Rodriguez no longer works for the agency. Homeland security didn\u2019t immediately return a call seeking comment. It was not immediately clear whether Rodriguez had a lawyer to speak for him, and a phone listing for him could not immediately be found, according to the AP. Tom Carson, a spokesman for the US attorney\u2019s office in Connecticut, told the AP he could not comment on whether there has been or will be a criminal investigation. The woman first met the Ice agent in 2006 after her brother was arrested for entering the US illegally, according to the lawsuit. Rodriguez found out she was also living in the country illegally and said that to avoid deportation she would have to become an informant by helping Ice locate criminals. According to the lawsuit she did so, but, in 2007, Rodriguez sexually assaulted her in a motel. He called himself the \u201cwolf\u201d and said he was the reason she and her family weren\u2019t deported, she says in the lawsuit. The woman alleges that the assaults continued and resulted in three pregnancies, each followed by abortions, one of which Rodriguez paid for. Later, he told her that he was leaving the agency but that if she told anyone what happened, \u201cshe and her family would pay\u201d, according to the lawsuit. The woman finally told her story last year when her father, living in the US and fearing deportation because of her friendliness with Ice, applied for asylum. She opened up to an agent who approached her about her father\u2019s application, the lawsuit says. The agent, she says, suggested she consult an attorney.",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it from the liveblog for today. Here\u2019s a recap: Bill Taylor, the acting US ambassador to Ukraine, testified that Donald Trump withheld military aid to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and the 2016 election. Taylor contradicted ongoing insistence from Trump and his allies that there was no quid pro quo. Democrats signaled that the Taylor testimony was a turning point, indicating that the inquiry will be speeding up in the coming days. Trump and his allies, continued to insist on the president\u2019s innocence. Republican lawmakers took to the House floor, reiterating claims that the inquiry was unfair and unethical. Democrats and Republicans condemned Trump\u2019s statements comparing the impeachment inquiry to a \u201clynching\u201d. The US envoy to Syria testified that he wasn\u2019t consulted on the decision to withdraw US troops. Russia won joint control of formerly Kurdish territory in Syria Even as House Republicans rally behind Trump and seek to discredit the impeachment inquiry, Pelosi is promoting a public petition to condemn Trump. There\u2019s no real purpose for such a petition \u2014 but it\u2019s a sign that Pelosi is sticking with her impeachment strategy despite Republican attacks. Several Republican representatives are speaking out against the impeachment inquiry, repeatedly calling it a sham, echoing language from the president, his press secretary, and his associates. Republicans including minority leader Kevin McCarthy are once again arguing that the inquiry is invalid because the House has not taken a vote to open it. Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said that there is no rule or regulation requiring such a vote. Trump held two days of meetings with House Republicans over the weekend at Camp David, signaling that the White House is working hard to ensure support as evidence mounts in favor of impeachment. Republican lawmakers are taking advantage of time allotted for one-minute speeches this evening to reiterate their loyalty to Trump. \u201cThe facts will exonerate our president,\u201d said Mark Meadows of North Carolina. \u201cInstead of wasting valuable time with this baseless inqurity there is so much more we could and should be doing,\u201d said Tim Whalberg of Michigan. One after another, Republicans repeated claims that the impeachment inquiry was illegitimate and unfair. Insisting \u201cthere was no quid pro quo\u201d, the White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, said in a statement: \u201cToday was just more triple hearsay and selective leaks from the Democrats\u2019 politically-motivated, closed-door, secretive hearings.\u201d She also said the inquiry was \u201ca coordinated smear campaign\u201d. \u201cTrump is so desperate not to love to Joe Biden that he threatened to withhold vital military assistance,\u201d said Biden\u2019s campaign manager Kate Bedingfield in a statement. \u201cThe president has betrayed his office,\u201d the statement reads. Trump to Netanyahu: \u2018You are great!\u2019 Trump wished Netanyahu a happy birthday, calling him \u201cone of my closest allies\u201d, in a letter sent on Monday, after the Israeli prime minister announced his failure to form a coalition government. \u201cYou are great!\u201d Trump added, in a handwritten note next to his signature. According to Axios, Netanyahu\u2019s office released the letter to show that he still had strong ties with Trump, who remains popular in Israel. James Jeffrey, the special envoy to Syria, said he wasn\u2019t consulted on the Trump administration\u2019s decision to withdraw troops. In a testimony before the Senate foreign relations committee, he said \u201cI personally was not consulted before the decision.\u201d He defended the administration, saying that Barack Obama and George W Bush both acted in Iraq without consulting him while he worked as an ambassador and a charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires, respectively. \u201cIn my current job, I feel that my views, through Secretary Pompeo have been brought repeatedly and frequently and, I think in many cases, effectively,\u201d he said. But lawmakers were incredulous. \u201cProfessionally are you indifferent to not being consulted about the matter that is in your lifelong expertise?\u201d asked Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia. \u201cWhether you mind it or not, I mind not being consulted.\u201d Bill Taylor\u2019s testimony \u2013 which contradicts claims by the president, his chief of staff and his and his associates \u2013 \u201cis a sea change\u201d, said the Democratic representative Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts. \u201cI think it could accelerate matters,\u201d he said. The Democratic representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida said: \u201cI do not know how you would listen to today\u2019s testimony from Ambassador Taylor and come to any other (conclusion) except that the president abused his power and withheld foreign aid\u201d Meanwhile, other Democrats, including those running for president, have reiterated their support for a speedy impeachment. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Bill Taylor, the acting US ambassador to Ukraine, testified in House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry that he was told Trump was holding up military aid to Ukraine until the country\u2019s president publicly announced investigations into Joe Biden and the 2016 election \u2013 contradicting Trump\u2019s repeated denials of a quid pro quo. Trump sparked outrage by comparing the impeachment inquiry to a \u201clynching\u201d. The anonymous author of a 2018 New York Times op-ed who claimed to be part of an internal White House \u201cresistance\u201d to Trump is now writing a book while maintaining anonymity. Russia has won joint control of formerly Kurdish territory in Syria, marking a crucial victory for Vladimir Putin after the withdrawal of US troops. The UK parliament rejected the Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s proposal to fast-track Brexit, virtually guaranteeing that Britain will not leave the EU by its set deadline at the end of the month. (Follow the Guardian\u2019s UK politics live blog for more.) Maanvi will have more on the news of the day, so stay tuned. Bill Taylor also said in his opening statement to the House committees investigating impeachment that a National Security Council official, Tim Morrison, had offered a less than glowing assessment of Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president. The acting US ambassador to Ukraine said: \u201cMr. Morrison told me that the call \u2018could have been better\u2019 and that President Trump had suggested that President Zelenskyy or his staff meet with Mr. Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr. I did not see any official readout of the call until it was publicly released on September 25.\u201d Morrison\u2019s opinion is a far cry from Trump\u2019s repeated assertions that his call with the Ukrainian president was \u201cperfect\u201d and included nothing improper. A Washington Post reporter summarized the opening statement of Bill Taylor, the acting US ambassador to Ukraine, in this way: According to the opening statement of Bill Taylor, Gordon Sondland said that \u201ceverything,\u201d including the release of military aid to Ukraine, was tied to the country\u2019s president publicly announcing investigations into Joe Biden and the 2016 election. Taylor, the acting US ambassador to Ukraine, said to the House committees investigating impeachment: \u201cAmbassador Sondland also told me that he now recognized that he had made a mistake by earlier telling the Ukrainian officials to whom he spoke that a White House meeting with President Zelenskyy was dependent on a public announcement of investigations \u2013 in fact, Ambassador Sondland said, \u2018everything\u2019 was dependent on such an announcement, including security assistance. \u201cHe said that President Trump wanted President Zelenskyy \u2018in a public box\u2019 by making a public statement about ordering such investigations.\u201d Bill Taylor said in his opening statement to the House committees investigating impeachment that he was preparing to resign in August over the delaying of military aid to Ukraine. The acting US ambassador to Ukraine said that he had a conversation on August 22 with Tim Morrison of the National Security Council. Morrison indicated during the phone call that Trump was opposed to authorizing any military aid to Ukraine. Taylor said: \u201cAs I had told Secretary [Mike] Pompeo in May, if the policy of strong support for Ukraine were to change, I would have to resign. Based on my call with Mr. Morrison, I was preparing to do so.\u201d In his opening statement to the House committees investigating impeachment, Bill Taylor said he was told by an official at the National Security Council that Trump had insisted the Ukrainian president himself publicly announce a probe into Joe Biden and his son. The acting US ambassador to Ukraine said: \u201cPresident Trump did insist that President Zelensky go to a microphone and say he is opening investigations of Biden and 2016 election interference, and that President Zelensky should want to do this himself.\u201d However, Taylor said that Trump had told Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU, he was not seeking a \u201cquid pro quo,\u201d even as military aid to Ukraine hung in the balance. At the risk of stating the obvious: if Trump demanded that the Ukrainian president make public announcements of investigations into Democrats before he would authorize the release of military aid, then his actions were the very definition of a quid pro quo. Bill Taylor said in his opening statement to the House committees investigating impeachment that he was concerned before accepting the role of acting US ambassador to Ukraine about Rudy Giuliani\u2019s role in the country. The longtime diplomat said: \u201cI worried about what I had heard concerning the role of Rudolph Giuliani, who made several high-profile statements about Ukraine and U.S. policy toward the country. \u201cSo during my meeting with Secretary [Mike] Pompeo on May 28, I made clear to him and the others present that if U.S. policy toward Ukraine changed, he would not want me posted there and I could not stay.\u201d After accepting the role, Taylor said he realized that Giuliani \u2013 along with Kurt Volker, Gordon Sondland and Rick Perry \u2013 controlled \u201can irregular, informal channel of U.S. policy-making with respect to Ukraine.\u201d Taylor said: \u201cAlthough this irregular channel was well-connected in Washington, it operated mostly outside of official State Department channels.\u201d The Washington Post has published a copy of Bill Taylor\u2019s opening statement to the House committees investigating impeachment. In the 15-page statement, the acting US ambassador to Ukraine and longtime civil servant describes how he became \u201cincreasingly concerned\u201d that the US-Ukraine relationship was being \u201cfundamentally undermined\u201d by withholding military aid for \u201cdomestic political reasons.\u201d Taylor added that he stood by his Sept. 9 text message to Gordon Sondland and Kurt Volker, in which he said it would be \u201ccrazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d It remains unknown whether the senior Trump administration official who is writing a book about being part of an internal \u201cresistance\u201d is still employed by the White House. According to CNN, the literary agency representing the author declined to comment on whether the person still worked in the administration. Here\u2019s another piece of news that the president will surely hate: The anonymous author of a 2018 New York Times op-ed that described a \u201cresistance\u201d inside the government to help control Trump is now writing a book. The Washington Post reports: The book, titled, \u2018A WARNING,\u2019 is being promoted as \u2018an unprecedented behind-the-scenes portrait of the Trump presidency\u2019 that expands upon the Times column, which ricocheted around the world and stoked the president\u2019s rage because of its devastating portrayal of Trump in office. The column described Trump\u2019s leadership style as \u2018impetuous, adversarial, petty and ineffective,\u2019 and noted that \u2018his impulsiveness results in half-baked, ill-informed and occasionally reckless decisions that have to be walked back.\u2019 ... The forthcoming book will list the author as \u2018Anonymous.\u2019 Although the person does not reveal their identity in the book, they will discuss the reasons for their anonymity, according to people involved in the project. Bill Taylor, the acting US ambassador to Ukraine, reportedly directly contradicted the testimony of Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU, in his opening statement to the House committees investigating impeachment. Several House Democrats involved in the investigation are already calling for Sondland to be called back to testify and answer for the discrepancies between the two men\u2019s accounts. Bill Taylor, the acting US ambassador to Ukraine, said in his opening statement to the House committees investigating impeachment that he was told military aid to Ukraine was contingent upon public announcements of investigations into Democrats, according to the Washington Post. The Post reports: Upon arriving in Kyiv last spring he became alarmed by secondary diplomatic channels involving U.S. officials that he called \u2018weird,\u2019 Taylor said, according to a copy of his lengthy opening statement obtained by The Washington Post. Taylor walked lawmakers through a series of conversations he had with other U.S. diplomats who were trying to obtain what one called the \u2018deliverable\u2019 of Ukrainian help investigating Trump\u2019s political rivals. Taylor said he spoke to Ambassador Gordon Sondland, the U.S. envoy to the European Union. \u2018During that phone call, Amb. Sondland told me that President Trump had told him that he wants President [Volodymyr] Zelensky to state publicly that Ukraine will investigate Burisma and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election,\u2019 Taylor said in the statement. Former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter had been a board member of Burisma, a large Ukrainian gas company. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, denied ever telling Trump that his Ukraine call was \u201cperfect,\u201d as the president has claimed. Asked whether Trump was lying, the Kentucky Republican replied: \u201cYou\u2019d have to ask him.\u201d McConnell also offered some muted criticism of Trump\u2019s use of the word \u201clynching\u201d to describe House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry, calling it \u201can unfortunate choice of words.\u201d There are major news developments happening away from House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry today. Russia and Turkey have just announced a plan to jointly control formerly Kurdish territory in Syria, marking a major victory for Vladimir Putin. The New York Times reports: [O]n Tuesday, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia played host to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, for more than six hours of talks on how they and other regional players will divide control of Syria, a land devastated by eight years of civil war. The negotiations ended with a victory for Mr. Putin: Russian and Turkish troops will take joint control over a vast swath of formerly Kurdish-held territory in northern Syria, in a move that cements the rapid expansion of Russian influence in Syria at the expense of the United States and its Kurdish former allies. Under the terms of the agreement, Syrian Kurdish forces must now retreat more than 20 miles from the border, abandoning land that they had controlled uncontested until earlier this month \u2014 when their protectors, the American military, suddenly began to withdraw from the region. Two Democratic members of the House oversight committee, Gerry Connolly of Virginia and Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois, suggested that Gordon Sondland may have to appear again before congressional investigators to respond to Bill Taylor\u2019s testimony. Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU, testified in the impeachment inquiry last week and insisted in a September text message to Taylor, the acting US ambassador to Ukraine, that there was \u201cno quid pro quo\u201d involved in the delaying of military aid to Ukraine. The Republican members of the House committees investigating impeachment have not been as forthcoming as their Democratic counterparts about Bill Taylor\u2019s testimony. However, even their subdued comments seem to speak volumes about what the acting US ambassador to Ukraine has said behind closed doors. Bill Taylor, the acting US ambassador to Ukraine, reportedly told House impeachment investigators that the Trump White House attempted to tie investigations of the president\u2019s political rivals to the country\u2019s military aid. Politico reports: Taylor prompted sighs and gasps when he read a lengthy 15-page opening statement, two of the sources said. Another person in the room said Taylor\u2019s statement described \u2018how pervasive the efforts were\u2019 among Trump\u2019s allies to convince Ukrainian officials to launch an investigation targeting former Vice President Joe Biden and another probe centering on a debunked conspiracy theory regarding the 2016 election. Taylor also described the extent to which military assistance to Ukraine and a potential White House meeting with Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart were tied to those investigations, the source added. The Twitter account for Merriam-Webster Dictionary is once again weighing in on Trump\u2019s latest controversy, this time reacting to his use of the term \u201clynching\u201d to describe House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. The dictionary\u2019s Twitter account has previously mocked the president for his use (and often misuse) of certain words. When Trump appeared to confuse a hyphen and an apostrophe last month, the dictionary tweeted out this helpful reminder. In some non-impeachment news, treasury secretary Steven Munchin and Jared Kushner reportedly plan to attend a Saudi investment conference a year after avoiding the event due to outrage over the killing of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The New York Times reports: The Treasury Department confirmed that Mr. Mnuchin will be participating in the Future Investment Initiative gathering in Riyadh. Jared Kushner, President Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, will also be attending the conference, alongside Brian H. Hook, the State Department\u2019s special envoy overseeing Iran policy and Avi Berkowitz, an aide to Mr. Kushner, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Mnuchin is expected to participate in a moderated discussion at the event. He initially planned to attend last year, but reversed that decision as global outrage mounted over the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post writer, whose killing in Turkey was orchestrated by the Saudi government. According to CNN, Bill Taylor told the House committees investigating impeachment that Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU, listed a desire for Ukraine to launch investigations into Democrats as one potential reason why military aid to the country was delayed. Representative Stephen Lynch, a Democratic member of the House oversight committee, said that Bill Taylor took \u201cextensive notes\u201d about his communications while serving as acting US ambassador to Ukraine. A number of Democrats sitting in on Taylor\u2019s closed-door appearance said that the longtime diplomat was the most important witness to testify in the impeachment inquiry yet. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Bill Taylor is testifying behind closed doors in House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry against Trump. The acting US ambassador to Ukraine said in a text last month that he thought it was \u201ccrazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d Trump was lambasted by many Democrats (and a much smaller number of Republicans) for comparing the impeachment investigation to a \u201clynching.\u201d A new poll found that half of Americans support impeaching Trump and removing him from office, marking a 13-point increase since late April. The blog will have plenty more coming up, so stay tuned. Another Democratic member of the House foreign affairs committee, Andy Levin of Michigan, described Bill Taylor\u2019s testimony as \u201cvery troubling.\u201d Levin said of the acting US ambassador to Ukraine\u2019s comments: \u201cAll I have to say is that in my 10 short months in Congress \u2013 it\u2019s not even noon, right \u2013 and this is my most disturbing day in Congress so far. Very troubling.\u201d Meanwhile, one of Levin\u2019s colleagues defended Taylor\u2019s reputation against potential smears from Trump\u2019s allies. Meanwhile, representative Mark Meadows, a Republican member of the House oversight committee and a close ally of Trump\u2019s, joked that Bill Taylor\u2019s interview could go on for much longer. The acting US ambassador to Ukraine started his testimony for House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry about three hours ago. The opening statement from Bill Taylor, the acting US ambassador to Ukraine, to the three House committees leading the impeachment inquiry solicited \u201csighs and gasps,\u201d according to a Politico reporter. The opening statements from Maria Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine, and Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU, were quickly leaked to the press, so it\u2019s likely the same will occur with Taylor\u2019s statement. A Republican senator, Susan Collins of Maine, condemned Trump\u2019s use of the term \u201clynching\u201d to describe House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. Collins\u2019 tweet appears to be one of the most forceful criticisms yet from Republicans, as other GOP lawmakers have simply said that they did not \u201cagree\u201d with Trump\u2019s usage of the term. Representative Ted Lieu, a Democratic member of the House foreign affairs committee, just emerged from the closed-door interview with Bill Taylor and said the acting US ambassador to Ukraine\u2019s testimony was \u201cincredibly damaging to the president.\u201d CNN reported earlier today that Taylor intended to use his testimony to fill in some of the gaps surrounding his 9 September text message, in which he said it was \u201ccrazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee who has repeatedly criticized Trump in the past, denounced the president\u2019s use of the term \u201clynching\u201d to describe House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. Steele also chastised Lindsey Graham after the South Carolina senator echoed Trump\u2019s use of the term and said the impeachment probe is \u201ca lynching in every sense.\u201d However, Graham does not appear to be changing his stance at all, insisting that the inquiry is a \u201cpolitical lynching\u201d and refusing to comment on the racist implications of Trump\u2019s comment. Representative Eric Swalwell, a Democratic member of the House intelligence committee, said in a tweet that Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU, asked Trump at one point: \u201cWhat do you want from Ukraine?\u201d Sondland testified in House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry last week and may have shared this detail with the investigating lawmakers behind closed doors, but the transcript of his appearance has not been publicly released. After Bill Taylor said in a text message last month that he thought it was \u201ccrazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d Sondland replied: \u201cBill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump\u2019s intentions. The President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind.\u201d However, reports later emerged that Sondland only sent his \u201cno quid pro quo\u201d message after speaking to Trump. The King Center, which honors the life of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, just tweeted out these facts about lynching after Trump used the term to describe the impeachment inquiry. A White House spokesperson defended Trump\u2019s use of the word \u201clynching\u201d to describe the impeachment inquiry by arguing that the president was not making a historical comparison. This explanation seems highly questionable, given that the word \u201clynching\u201d has almost exclusively been applied to the thousands of people (most of them African American) who were murdered in the late 19th and early 20th century. It seems virtually impossible that Trump is unaware of this history, particularly given that the Senate passed a bill last year to make lynching a hate crime. The president has not yet signed the legislation. Bill Taylor, the acting US ambassador to Ukraine who is currently speaking to House members for Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry against Trump, was reportedly subpoenaed for his testimony. Other officials who have spoken to the three House committees leading the inquiry have similarly been subpoenaed \u2013 including Taylor\u2019s predecessor, Maria Yovanovitch. Senator Tim Scott, the only African American Republican serving in the Senate, offered this muted criticism of Trump\u2019s use of the term \u201clynching\u201d to describe the impeachment inquiry. In some news far from Washington, former president Jimmy Carter, 95, has been hospitalized for the second time this month due to a fall in his Georgia home. The AP reports: Carter Center spokeswoman Deanne Congileo described the fracture as minor. Her statement said that the 95-year-old was in good spirits at the Phoebe Sumter Medical Center after falling on Monday evening, and that he was looking forward to recovering at home. This is the third time Carter has fallen in recent months. He first fell in the spring and required hip replacement surgery. Carter fell again this month and despite receiving 14 stitches, traveled the next day to Nashville, Tennessee to rally volunteers and help build a Habitat for Humanity home. Carter is the oldest living former president in U.S. history. He and 92-year-old Rosalynn recently became the longest married first couple, surpassing George and Barbara Bush, with more than 73 years of marriage. At least one of Trump\u2019s allies on Capitol Hill, House minority leader Kevin McCarthy, said he did not agree with the president\u2019s use of the term \u201clynching\u201d to describe the impeachment inquiry. The California Republican said: \u201cThat\u2019s not the language I would use. ... I don\u2019t agree with that language, pretty simple.\u201d Meanwhile, several House Democrats warned that Trump was simply trying to spark indignation to distract from the testimony of Bill Taylor, the acting US ambassador to Ukraine who said it was \u201ccrazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d One of Trump\u2019s closest congressional allies, senator Lindsey Graham, echoed the president\u2019s use of the term \u201clynching\u201d to describe the impeachment inquiry. Graham has been very critical of Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw US troops from northern Syria, and the South Carolina senator said in a recent interview that he would be open to considering evidence in connection to the president\u2019s possible removal from office. However, it appears that (for now at least) Graham is standing by Trump in slamming the impeachment inquiry in the most controversial terms possible. Despite widespread outrage to Trump\u2019s \u201clynching\u201d tweet, at least one of his congressional allies did not raise much concern about the president invoking centuries of violence against African Americans to criticize the impeachment inquiry. As the acting US ambassador to Ukraine testifies behind closed doors on Capitol Hill, more House Democrats expressed outrage at Trump for comparing the impeachment inquiry to a \u201clynching.\u201d From an Illinois congressman: A Texas congresswoman called it a \u201cdisgrace\u201d: The chairwoman of the congressional black caucus argued that the tweet fits a pattern of Trump using the most vile language possible when he feels cornered: A CNN reporter similarly suggested that the tweet was Trump\u2019s way of trying to distract from the many controversies he is facing at home and abroad right now: In his closed-door testimony, Bill Taylor reportedly intends to describe the events leading up to his text messages about a potential quid pro quo in the delaying of military aid to Ukraine, but he is not looking to issue his own statement. CNN reports: Taylor, who is testifying before the three House committees leading the Democratic impeachment inquiry, will lay out the reasoning behind his different WhatsApp text messages in his opening statement Tuesday, [a source familiar with his testimony] said. Taylor plans to include a chronology of events, according to the source, dating back to June, when Taylor assumed the post as ambassador, through October. ... Taylor will not be bringing any new documents to the committee, he will just be referencing those that have already been made public, the source said. ... Taylor, as the current acting ambassador to Ukraine, is in a difficult and delicate position testifying Tuesday, the source said. Taylor\u2019s view is that he is there to speak to committee and answer their questions, and he\u2019s not looking to issue his own statement publicly. ... Taylor plans to return to Ukraine on Wednesday, the source said. He wants to keep his job, and thinks it is important work. Bill Taylor, the acting US ambassador to Ukraine, has arrived on Capitol Hill to testify in House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry against Trump. The longtime diplomat wrote in a text last month to Kurt Volker, the former US special envoy to Ukraine, and Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU, that it was \u201ccrazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d House Democrats hope Taylor can shed light on whether Trump held up military aid to Ukraine specifically to pressure officials there to investigate Joe Biden. Half of Americans believe that Trump should be impeached and removed from office, according to a CNN/SSRS poll released this morning. The results showed that 50 percent of Americans would support Trump\u2019s removal, compared to 43 percent of Americans who would oppose it. That level of support marks a 13-point increase since late April, following the release of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s redacted report. In comparison, CNN\u2019s polling never surpassed 30 percent when measuring support of Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment, a Bloomberg News reporter noted. Reactions are rolling in to Trump\u2019s description of the impeachment inquiry as a \u201clynching,\u201d and they are unsurprisingly furious. From the president of the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law: From an Atlantic staff writer: Representative Jim Clyburn, Democrats\u2019 House majority whip and a former chairman of the congressional black caucus, urged Trump to \u201cknow the history of that word.\u201d Good morning, live blog readers! It is a big day in House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump. Bill Taylor, the acting US ambassador to Ukraine who took over the the post after the ouster of Maria Yovanovitch, is expected to testify at 9:30 a.m. E.T., and he could provide critical information on whether military aid to the country was held up over Trump\u2019s demand for an investigation into the Democrats. In a September 9 text message to Kurt Volker, the former US special envoy to Ukraine, and Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU, Taylor wrote: \u201cAs I said on the phone, I think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d A number of House Democrats believe that Taylor\u2019s testimony could provide a smoking gun on the question of whether Trump tried to pressure a foreign power to investigate one of his political rivals, Joe Biden. The president is clearly worried about Taylor\u2019s testimony, if his morning Twitter feed is any indication. Trump lashed out against the investigation in a series of tweets, even referring to the probe as a \u201clynching.\u201d Trump\u2019s use of a term that invokes centuries of racist violence against African Americans will certainly incense many Democrats, and it will may also frustrate some of the congressional Republicans who privately say they are growing tired of defending the president\u2019s most controversial comments and decisions. Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping its eye on: Trump will have lunch with secretary of state Mike Pompeo at 12:45 p.m. E.T. Fortune will continue its Most Powerful Women Summit in Washington, where Trump\u2019s former homeland security secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, will be interviewed at 2:35 p.m. E.T. Nielsen\u2019s expected appearance has set off controversy, given her instrumental role in the migrant family separation crisis. House Republican leadership will hold a press conference at 10 a.m. E.T. That\u2019s all still coming up, so stay tuned.",
