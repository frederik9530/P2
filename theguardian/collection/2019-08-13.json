      "bodyText": "Simon Armitage\u2019s latest poem, a \u201cbullet / with cancer\u2019s name / carved brazenly on it\u201d, is yet to be printed or read aloud by the poet laureate from the stage. Instead, the work has been engraved by micro-artist Graham Short on to a 2cm x 1cm chemotherapy pill, in what Short said was probably the hardest job had had ever done. Entitled Finishing It, the poem \u2013 Armitage\u2019s second as poet laureate \u2013 was commissioned by the Institute of Cancer Research in London. It is intended to symbolise the new generation of cancer treatments that the Institute\u2019s planned Centre for Cancer Drug Discovery will create, and which it hopes will turn cancer into a manageable disease. \u201cI can\u2019t configure / a tablet / chiselled by God\u2019s finger,\u201d writes Armitage. Instead, the poet has crafted \u201cthe sugared pill / of a poem, one sentence / that speaks ill // of illness itself\u201d. Running to 51 words, the poem was given to Short to engrave on a replica chemotherapy pill, which is intended to represent the drugs that the Institute hopes to develop in the new centre. \u201cThe pill kept crumbling and it was so difficult to do,\u201d said Short, who swims 10,000 metres a day to lower his resting pulse rate, and works from midnight to 5am to avoid vibrations from passing traffic. \u201cI work in an unusual way, wearing a stethoscope and taking tablets to get my heart rate down to 20-25 bpm. What I\u2019m trying to do then, using very fine needles, is engrave between heartbeats.\u201d Short\u2019s tablet will be displayed in the Centre for Cancer Drug Discovery when it opens in 2020. Currently under construction \u2013 and still requiring an additional \u00a314m in donations to be completed \u2013 the centre is intended to bring together hundreds of scientists to collaborate on a programme that will overcome cancer\u2019s ability to develop resistance to drugs. Armitage said: \u201cScience and poetry are closer associates than many people assume, and it was exciting to work on a project that deals with cutting-edge medical research.

      "bodyText": "Two television ads, one featuring new dads bungling comically while looking after their babies and the other a woman sitting next to a pram, have become the first to be banned under new rules designed to reduce gender stereotyping. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) banned the ads for Philadelphia cream cheese and Volkswagen, following complaints from the public that they perpetuated harmful stereotypes. The new rules, introduced at the beginning of the year, ban the depiction of men and women engaged in gender-stereotypical activities to help stop \u201climiting how people see themselves and how others see them and the life decisions they take\u201d. In the ad for Philadelphia, the Mondelez-owned cream cheese brand, two new dads were shown eating lunch at a restaurant where food circulated on a conveyor belt. While chatting they accidentally find their babies are whisked away on it. \u201cLet\u2019s not tell mum,\u201d one of them says. Complainants said the tongue-in-cheek ad perpetuated a harmful stereotype suggesting men were incapable of caring for children and would put them at risk as a result of their incompetence. Mondelez told the ASA it was stuck in a no-win situation, having specifically chosen two dads to avoid depicting the stereotypical image of showing two new mums handling all the childcare responsibilities. The ASA banned the ad, saying it reinforced the idea that men were ineffective childcarers. The ad for Volkswagen\u2019s electric eGolf vehicle showed a series of scenes including a man and a woman in a tent on a sheer cliff face, two male astronauts, a male para-athlete and a woman sitting on a bench next to a pram. Text stated: \u201cWhen we learn to adapt we can achieve anything.\u201d Complainants said the ad showed men engaged in adventurous activities, that unlike her male counterpart, the female rock climber was \u201cpassive\u201d because she was asleep, and that the woman with the pram was depicted in a stereotypical care-giving role. Volkswagen said its ad was not sexist and that caring for a newborn was a life-changing experience about adaptation, regardless of the gender of the parent depicted. The ASA, however, \u201cconcluded that the ad presented gender stereotypes in a way that was likely to cause harm\u201d. Critics said the new rules were too draconian and that banning even the most innocuous use of gender stereotypes showed the watchdog had gone too far. \u201cIt is concerning to see the ASA take on the role of the morality police,\u201d said Geraint Lloyd-Taylor, an advertising expert at the law firm Lewis Silkin. \u201cIt has let its zeal to enforce the new rules override its common sense in this first batch of rulings. \u201cThe ASA seems to be out of sync with society in general.

O\u2019Grady said: \u201cIt\u2019s time to take the railways back into public hands. Every single penny from every single fare should be invested into our railways.\u201c</p> <p>Labour said passengers were \u201cpaying more for less\u201d and promised to take the take the railway back into state ownership as franchises expired.</p> <p>Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, said: \u201cIt is indefensible and intolerable that many fares may, once again, rise faster than inflation. Rail travel has got more expensive every year in real terms under the Conservatives. What\u2019s worse is that as rail performance and service quality has declined passengers are paying more for less.\u201d</p> <p>But the government defended the planned increase. The rail minister, Chris Heaton-Harris, said: \u201cIt\u2019s tempting to suggest fares should never rise. However, the truth is that if we stop investing in our railway then we will never see it improved.\u201d</p> <p>Bruce Williamson, from the campaign group Railfuture, warned: \u201cIt might be that we\u2019ve now reached the point where we cannot simply put fares up and expect passengers to take the hit. They will just give up and refuse to pay. They will either find another job or another form of transport.\u201d</p> <p>The number of journeys made by commuters using season tickets has dropped by 12.5% in three years, from 712m in 2015-16 to 625m this year.</p> <p>The July RPI figure will dictate the maximum rise to regulated fares, which account for about half of all rail journeys, including season tickets on most commuter routes, off-peak returns on long-distance trains and anytime tickets around major cities.</p> <p>A 2.9% increase would make a Leeds to Manchester annual season ticket \u00a394 more expensive, at \u00a33,366 and would add more than \u00a3120 to a Brighton to London or Edinburgh to Glasgow season ticket, both costing more than \u00a34,200.</p> <p>The previous transport secretary Chris Grayling had discussed abandoning the RPI measure of inflation and raising fares in line with the more common consumer prices index (CPI). The RPI measure is generally higher than CPI and regarded as less accurate.</p> <p>The Campaign for Better Transport called for the government to commit to the change. Its chief executive, Darren Shirley, said: \u201cThere is still no end in sight to these exorbitant increases that will cost commuters dearly from January.\u201d</p> <p>The Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which represents private train operators and Network Rail, said 98p in every \u00a31 taken in fares was put back into running the railway. Robert Nisbet, an RDG director, said: \u201cNo one wants to pay more to get to work but, by holding rises down to no more than inflation, government is ensuring that money from fares continues to cover almost all of the day-to-day costs of running rail services.\u201d</p> <p>News of the increase comes after a year in which the structure and functioning of the railways has been called into question. Major commuter routes have largely recovered from the chaos of the 2018 summer timetable change, when there were thousands of cancellations and the railway recorded its worst punctuality performance in 18 years, but other problems have persisted.</p> <p>The mayors of Greater Manchester and Liverpool city region have demanded that Arriva be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/may/29/manchester-and-liverpool-mayors-call-for-termination-of-northern-rail-franchise\">stripped of its Northern rail franchise</a>, saying little had improved in a year of misery for passengers since the timetable chaos. The promised withdrawal of notorious rolling stock only saw the first Pacer train retired this week.</p> <p>Strikes have persisted on routes including South Western and Northern, and a bigger row could loom over rail pensions. The RMT has threatened a national strike without assurances over a near \u00a36bn deficit in the industry\u2019s staff pension fund.</p> <p>This summer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/28/strikes-damaged-infrastructure-more-misery-train-passengers\">new problems have developed</a>, with trains struggling to run in the June heatwave and commuters left stranded around the network last week due to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/09/power-cut-hits-london-and-south-east-england\">power outages</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The future of the privatised franchise system has been plunged into deeper uncertainty by the cancellation of the Southeastern competition by the new transport secretary, Grant Shapps. A decision on the West Coast intercity service has also been delayed amid boardroom chaos at frontrunner FirstGroup, which is expected to edge out a Chinese bid led by MTR. The contract award, which will include the introduction of HS2 high-speed train services from 2026, may be announced as early as Wednesday morning while the spotlight turns to rail fares. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/apr/10/stagecoach-barred-from-rail-franchise-bids-over-pensions-row\">incumbent Stagecoach-Virgin is suing the government</a> after being barred from bidding for the franchise again.</p> <p>Campaigners and unions will stage protests against the fare increases on Wednesday at stations around Britain. Ellen Lees from We Own It said: \u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable that rail fares are going up yet again after the year we\u2019ve had on the railways.\u201d</p> <p>Mick Cash, the general secretary of the RMT union, said: \u201cThe increase will only serve to make the rail network less affordable and accessible for the travelling public. We need a publicly owned and nationally integrated railway now.\u201d</p> <p>A rail review commissioned by Grayling and led by the British Airways chief executive Keith Williams is due to publish its findings in the autumn. It could recommend a new arm\u2019s-length body to run the railways, but nationalisation appears to have been ruled out by Williams.</p> <p>The Department for Transport announced one initiative to ease costs for younger travellers, a new railcard for those aged 16 and 17, costing \u00a330 and giving 50% off fares. The government said it could allow 1.2 million youngsters to save an average of \u00a3186 a year.</p>",

Frances O\u2019Grady, the TUC general secretary, said: \u201cThe last thing UK commuters need is another hefty fare increase. We\u2019re already paying the highest ticket prices in Europe to travel on overcrowded and understaffed trains.\u201d The TUC said private train operators paid out \u00a3200m in dividends to their shareholders in 2017-18 and received \u00a33.8bn in public subsidy. O\u2019Grady said: \u201cIt\u2019s time to take the railways back into public hands. Every single penny from every single fare should be invested into our railways.\u201c Labour said passengers were \u201cpaying more for less\u201d and promised to take the take the railway back into state ownership as franchises expired. Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, said: \u201cIt is indefensible and intolerable that many fares may, once again, rise faster than inflation. Rail travel has got more expensive every year in real terms under the Conservatives. What\u2019s worse is that as rail performance and service quality has declined passengers are paying more for less.\u201d But the government defended the planned increase. The rail minister, Chris Heaton-Harris, said: \u201cIt\u2019s tempting to suggest fares should never rise. However, the truth is that if we stop investing in our railway then we will never see it improved.\u201d Bruce Williamson, from the campaign group Railfuture, warned: \u201cIt might be that we\u2019ve now reached the point where we cannot simply put fares up and expect passengers to take the hit. They will just give up and refuse to pay. They will either find another job or another form of transport.\u201d The number of journeys made by commuters using season tickets has dropped by 12.5% in three years, from 712m in 2015-16 to 625m this year. The July RPI figure will dictate the maximum rise to regulated fares, which account for about half of all rail journeys, including season tickets on most commuter routes, off-peak returns on long-distance trains and anytime tickets around major cities. A 2.9% increase would make a Leeds to Manchester annual season ticket \u00a394 more expensive, at \u00a33,366 and would add more than \u00a3120 to a Brighton to London or Edinburgh to Glasgow season ticket, both costing more than \u00a34,200. The previous transport secretary Chris Grayling had discussed abandoning the RPI measure of inflation and raising fares in line with the more common consumer prices index (CPI). The RPI measure is generally higher than CPI and regarded as less accurate. The Campaign for Better Transport called for the government to commit to the change. Its chief executive, Darren Shirley, said: \u201cThere is still no end in sight to these exorbitant increases that will cost commuters dearly from January.\u201d The Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which represents private train operators and Network Rail, said 98p in every \u00a31 taken in fares was put back into running the railway. Robert Nisbet, an RDG director, said: \u201cNo one wants to pay more to get to work but, by holding rises down to no more than inflation, government is ensuring that money from fares continues to cover almost all of the day-to-day costs of running rail services.\u201d News of the increase comes after a year in which the structure and functioning of the railways has been called into question. Major commuter routes have largely recovered from the chaos of the 2018 summer timetable change, when there were thousands of cancellations and the railway recorded its worst punctuality performance in 18 years, but other problems have persisted. The mayors of Greater Manchester and Liverpool city region have demanded that Arriva be stripped of its Northern rail franchise, saying little had improved in a year of misery for passengers since the timetable chaos. The promised withdrawal of notorious rolling stock only saw the first Pacer train retired this week. Strikes have persisted on routes including South Western and Northern, and a bigger row could loom over rail pensions. The RMT has threatened a national strike without assurances over a near \u00a36bn deficit in the industry\u2019s staff pension fund. This summer, new problems have developed, with trains struggling to run in the June heatwave and commuters left stranded around the network last week due to power outages. The future of the privatised franchise system has been plunged into deeper uncertainty by the cancellation of the Southeastern competition by the new transport secretary, Grant Shapps. A decision on the West Coast intercity service has also been delayed amid boardroom chaos at frontrunner FirstGroup, which is expected to edge out a Chinese bid led by MTR. The contract award, which will include the introduction of HS2 high-speed train services from 2026, may be announced as early as Wednesday morning while the spotlight turns to rail fares. The incumbent Stagecoach-Virgin is suing the government after being barred from bidding for the franchise again. Campaigners and unions will stage protests against the fare increases on Wednesday at stations around Britain. Ellen Lees from We Own It said: \u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable that rail fares are going up yet again after the year we\u2019ve had on the railways.\u201d Mick Cash, the general secretary of the RMT union, said: \u201cThe increase will only serve to make the rail network less affordable and accessible for the travelling public. We need a publicly owned and nationally integrated railway now.\u201d A rail review commissioned by Grayling and led by the British Airways chief executive Keith Williams is due to publish its findings in the autumn. It could recommend a new arm\u2019s-length body to run the railways, but nationalisation appears to have been ruled out by Williams. The Department for Transport announced one initiative to ease costs for younger travellers, a new railcard for those aged 16 and 17, costing \u00a330 and giving 50% off fares. The government said it could allow 1.2 million youngsters to save an average of \u00a3186 a year.",

      "bodyText": "Porto were dumped out of the Champions League by Russian side Krasnodar on a dramatic night of qualifiers, with Ajax coming from behind to edge out PAOK Salonika on aggregate. S\u00e9rgio Concei\u00e7\u00e3o\u2019s side led 1-0 after the first leg in Russia, but Dutch midfielder Tonny Vilhena levelled the tie early on in Portugal, volleying home from a corner. Winger Shapi Suleymanov then struck twice, finishing counterattacks in clinical fashion to put Krasnodar in control of the tie at half-time. Porto rallied in the second half, with Z\u00e9 Lu\u00eds and Luis D\u00edaz pulling two goals back, but Krasnodar held on to progress to the final play-off round on away goals. They will now face Olympiacos, who overcame Istanbul Basaksehir 3-0 on aggregate. It is only the second time since winning the trophy under Jos\u00e9 Mourinho in 2004 that Porto have failed to reach the Champions League group stages. Krasnodar did not even exist then \u2013 last season\u2019s third-placed finishers in Russia were founded in 2008. Last season\u2019s semi-finalists Ajax were given a scare by Greek champions PAOK Salonika before squeezing through to the final qualifying round. After a 2-2 draw in the first leg, PAOK took the lead in Amsterdam through Diego Biseswar, a winger developed at Ajax\u2019s academy, who fired inside the near post from 18 yards. Dusan Tadic missed a penalty, but scored a second to bring Ajax level on the night, and ahead on away goals. Nicol\u00e1s Tagliafico then scored a header with 10 minutes to go to put Ajax 4-3 up on aggregate, before a second Tadic penalty saw the hosts through despite Biseswar\u2019s second goal in stoppage time. Ajax will face Cyprus\u2019s Apoel in the play-offs after they overturned a 2-1 first-leg deficit to defeat Qarabag with a 2-0 victory in Azerbaijan. Elsewhere, Club Brugge edged out Dynamo Kyiv after a frantic finale, the Belgian side prevailing 4-3 on aggregate after a 3-3 draw \u2013 with three goals coming in the last five minutes. Club Brugge will next play LASK Linz, who followed up a 2-1 away win over Basel with a 3-1 home victory. Kemal Ademi\u2019s 80th-minute effort set up a nervous finish, but late goals from Thomas Goiginger and Marko Raguz secured the Austrians\u2019 play-off place. Celtic crashed out after losing 4-3 at home to CFR Cluj, who will face Slavia Prague next, while Rosenborg and Dinamo Zagreb set up a play-off tie with comfortable aggregate wins. Only one tie went to penalties \u2013 and the shootout didn\u2019t disappoint, with Red Star Belgrade edging out Copenhagen 7-6 after 22 spot kicks.",

The study found the same trio of factors explained much less of the link in boys.

Graham Alexander, City\u2019s manager, will also hardly lose sleep over the reverse, given how Gary Neville, one of the Class of 92 co-owners, said beforehand that the chasing of a fifth promotion in six seasons is the club\u2019s priority. Leeds now meet Stoke in the next round of a competition they have won once \u2013 in 1968. Alexander said he was proud of his team\u2019s effort and he was correct to be so, given the quality of the opposition. After the opening two league games in Salford\u2019s history \u2013 a win and a loss \u2013 came this first meeting with Leeds, who arrived with a victory and draw from their two Championship fixtures. Alexander made four changes as he drafted in Jake Beesley, Oscar Threlkeld, Joey Jones and Danny Whitehead, while Bielsa stood down seven, retaining Kiko Casilla, Ben White, Mateusz Klich and Kalvin Phillips. Each team operated a three-man defence, with Salford starting impressively in what was a warning to their visitors.

Emmanuel Dieseruvwe flicked a header on to Towell and when he crossed in from the right the lively Beesley tested Casilla, who saved low down. Leeds\u2019s best chance of breaching Salford appeared via the probing of Phillips from his central area and out wide from Ezgjan Alioski, whose penchant for a whipped-in ball was a threat. As half-time neared, though, Salford were matching the high intensity of Leeds, Lois Maynard proving a N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9-like presence in front of his defence, putting out fires as the team in grey started them. All of this meant that Leeds were often reduced to taking aim from range as when Clarke tried his luck on the left.

Angela Rayner, Labour\u2019s education secretary, said the next Labour government would undertake an overhaul of the structure and timing of the higher education admissions system in England, to avoid relying on inaccurate A-level grade forecasts and to halt the controversial use of unconditional offers for school-leavers. The announcement comes as more than 300,000 school-leavers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland await the results of their A-levels and other qualifications later this week, with the majority holding offers of undergraduate places dependent on achieving specific grades. In most cases the offers are the result of applications made in January or earlier, but under Rayner\u2019s plan the decision-making process at English institutions would be delayed until after 18 and 19-year-olds have had their exams marked and received their grades. \u201cThe higher education admissions system isn\u2019t working for students and radical action is needed to change that. Predicted grades are wrong in the vast majority of cases and disadvantaged students in particular are losing out on opportunities on the basis of those inaccurate predictions,\u201d Rayner said. Labour said a new admissions system would require consultation with schools and universities but would end England\u2019s unusual status in requiring students to apply without knowing if they have achieved the right grades, leading to more than one in five students not receiving their first choice of course. Research has found that around 1,000 high-achieving students from disadvantaged backgrounds have their grades under-predicted each year, which can force them to wait a year to reapply to highly selective institutions such as Cambridge or Imperial College London.

Plus there are Champions League and Europa League qualifiers to sprinkle a little stardust over proceedings.

      "bodyText": "Paul McInnes was at Kingsmeadow to see a whole load of missed penalties, and MK Dons\u2019 eventual victory: Here\u2019s the Carabao Cup second-round draw in full. Ties to be played in the week beginning 26 August: South section Plymouth v Reading Crawley v Norwich Newport v West Ham Oxford v Millwall Watford v Coventry Swansea v Cambridge Cardiff v Luton Bristol Rovers v Brighton Crystal Palace v Colchester Fulham v Southampton Bournemouth v Forest Green Southend v MK Dons QPR v Portsmouth North section Crewe v Aston Villa Lincoln v Everton Leeds v Stoke Sheff Utd v Blackburn Rotherham v Sheff Wed/Bury Newcastle v Leicester Burton v Morecambe Burnley v Sunderland Nottm Forest v Derby Grimsby v Macclesfield Preston v Hull Rochdale v Carlisle Meanwhile from the northern section, the following top-flight-focused fixtures were plucked from the hat: Crewe v Aston Villa Lincoln v Everton Sheffield United v Blackburn Newcastle United v Leicester Burnley v Sunderland There were six Premier League sides in the south section of the draw, and these are their games: Newport County v West Ham Watford v Coventry Bristol Rovers v Brighton Crystal Palace v Colchester Fulham v Southampton Bournemouth v Forest Green The Carabao Cup second round draw is about to happen! Jamie Jackson has filed his report from Salford: There is an epic shoot-out taking place in Copenhagen! And it\u2019s all over! Crvena Zvezda/Red Star Belgrade are through 7-6, after 11 penalties each! Also through after a shoot-out: Reading, after a 1-1 draw at Wycombe, Macclesfield, after a 2-2 draw with Blackpool, Mansfield, after a 2-2 draw with Morecambe, Cambridge United, after a 1-1 draw at Brentford, and Newport County, after a 2-2 draw at Gillingham. Some penalty shoot-out winners: Crewe, after a 2-2 draw with Middlesbrough, Forest Green, after a goalless draw at Charlton, QPR, after a 3-3 draw with Bristol City. George Tucudean, who scored Cluj\u2019s final goal in Glasgow, had a trial at Celtic when he was 15 and was taken to a game between Celtic and Barcelona. Now 28, he recently revealed that a heart defect may force him to retire. GOAL! Celtic 3-4 Cluj! George Tucudean has finished it! The final whistle has blown here, and Celtic are out of the Champions League! GOAL! Blackburn 3-2 Oldham! Joe Rothwell has scored in the 95th minute! Blackburn were 2-1 down in the second minute of stoppage time, and have won the game before the final whistle sounds! With Carabao Cup ties going straight to penalties if they are drawn after 90 minutes, there are about to be a lot of penalties to report on. I\u2019ll do my best. GOAL! Middlesbrough 2-2 Crewe! Crewe won the first half 2-0, with their second goal in the first minute of stoppage time. Middlesbrough are winning the second half 2-0, with their second goal in the first minute of stoppage time. Into stoppage time at Celtic, but there will be six minutes of it. Can they conjure another goal? Copenhagen and Red Star Belgrade have drawn 1-1, as they did in the first leg, and extra time didn\u2019t bring any further goals. That one will have to be decided by a penalty shoot-out. Final score: Ajax 3-2 PAOK! The Greeks didn\u2019t get another. Ajax win 5-4 on aggregate. GOAL! Ajax 3-2 PAOK! Diego Biseswar has scored in the 94th minute, his second of the game,but the Greeks still need another! GOAL! Swansea 2-1 Northampton! Swansea were a goal down in the 80th minute, and they\u2019re one up in the 83rd! GOAL! Celtic 3-3 Cluj! Billel Omrani again! That\u2019s three goals in six minutes, and there are 10 more to go. Celtic need to score another, or they\u2019re out. GOAL! Celtic 3-2 Cluj! Ryan Christie hands the advantage back to Celtic! There were less than two minutes between the goals in this ding-dong battle. GOAL! Celtic 2-2 Cluj! Billel Omrani has equalised from the spot for Cluj after Scott Brown handled in the area. Cluj are now ahead on away goals! Poor Bolton, 2-1 up in the 64th minute, are 3-2 down to Rochdale in the 66th. GOAL! Ajax 2-1 PAOK! Tagliafico has given last season\u2019s Champions League semi-finalists an aggregate lead over PAOK in the third qualifying round, with just 11 minutes to go. Cowabunga! Liam Walsh scores a brilliant dipping free kick from 35 yards to give Bristol CIty a 3-2 lead at QPR! That\u2019s a fabulous hit. A second penalty, and a second penalty miss, at Wimbledon. This time it\u2019s the home side fluffing their chance, Joe Pigott sidefooting unconvincingly to his right and the keeper going the right way and making a straightforward save. GOAL! Celtic 2-1 Cluj! The Scottish champions have turned this around, and lead 3-2 on aggregate! Edsonne Edouard has snaffled the second there. Bojan Bozovic has equalised for Sutjeska at Linfield. It\u2019s 2-2 there now, though the Northern Irish side lead 4-3 on aggregate. GOAL! Salford 0-3 Leeds United! From a Salford corner Leeds break, and Mateusz Klich curls in a cracker from the edge of the area! This game is very much in the bag now. David Kasumu has scored a lovely goal for MK Dons at Wimbledon, giving his side a 2-1 lead with a curler into the top corner from the edge of the area. GOAL! Celtic 1-1 Cluj! James Forrest has equalised for Celtic, and the tie is now completely level, 2-2 on aggregate! GOAL! Salford 0-2 Leeds! A corner is sent to the near post, where Gaetano Berardi flicks in a tidy volley! Slovan Bratislava are 2-0 up at Dundalk now, in first-half stoppage time, and lead 3-0 on aggregate. This really is revolutionary. An 18-year-old album being played in full, rather than a handful of recent Spotify phenomenons and something by Oasis. This changes everything. Ferencvaros came away from Zagreb with a creditable 1-1 draw in the first leg of their Champions League qualifier, and only needed to put in a decent performance in Budapest to earn a notable scalp and move to the playoff round. Instead they\u2019re 4-0 down, and with only seven minutes to play. Crewe have scored twice in four minutes late in the first half and now lead Middlesbrough, who made 10 changes for this game and appear to be playing like strangers, 2-0 And another debut goal, this from Hull\u2019s Ryan Tafazolli who has headed his team into a three-goal lead at Tranmere! GOAL! Salford 0-1 Leeds! Another debut goal, this from Arsenal loanee Eddie Nketia, who taps in after an excellent low cross from the right! Dynamo\u2019s dream has died: Lo\u00efs Openda has scored for Brugge in the 95th minute to make it 3-3 on the night, 4-3 to the Belgians on aggregate, and it\u2019s surely all over. And as I type that, the referee blows his whistle and it is literally all over. Brandon Mechele has scored a 93rd-minute own goal to give Dynamo Kyiv a lifeline in the Champions League! Club Brugge are 3-2 down on the night but it\u2019s 3-3 on aggregate; the Ukrainians still need another goal to go through! There is a proper shock on in the Champions League, with Krasnodar now 2-0 up at Porto and now 2-1 up on aggregate. They\u2019ve scored with their first two shots; Porto have had twice as many, but converted none of them. Billel Omrani has put Cluj a goal up at Celtic Park, with the Romanian side now 2-1 up on aggregate. Dusan Tadic has equalised from the spot to make it Ajax 1-1 PAOK. It\u2019s 3-3 on aggregate, with the Dutch side ahead on away goals. Linfield lead 2-1 in the Europa League, and 4-2 on aggregate, over Sutjeska. In Ireland meanwhile Dundalk trail 1-0 to Slovan Bratislava, who are now 2-0 up on aggregate with an away goal to boot. Charlie Austin has scored nine minutes into his debut for West Bromwich Albion, nodding in from about an inch after Grady Diangana\u2019s shot from distance was pushed onto the bar. West Brom lead Millwall 1-0. Dynamo Kyiv lead Club Brugge 2-1 with seven minutes of their Champions League qualifier to go, but it\u2019s 2-2 on aggregate, which puts the Belgians at an aggregate advantage, and they also now have a numerical advantage, Mykyta Burda having just been shown a second yellow card. QPR and Bristol City are drawing, having each scored in the space of two minutes. Nahki Wells\u2019 equaliser for Rangers was particularly smart, struck first-time from outside the area and surprising the goalkeeper, who didn\u2019t move. MK Dons have equalised against Wimbledon, Conor McGrandles making amends for his penalty miss with some nifty footwork in the penalty area followed by a precise left-foot finish. Blackburn\u2019s 11 changes haven\u2019t worked as well as Hull\u2019s - Gevaro Nepomuceno has giveen Oldham a 1-0 lead there. In the Europa League, Linfield took an early lead against Sutjeska and have since been pulled back - it\u2019s 1-1 in the 16th minute, with Linfield 3-2 ahead on aggregate. Ajax are losing 1-0 at home to PAOK in the Champions League and as it stands are on their way out of the competition, the Greek side leading 3-2 on aggregate. I think Nathan Collins was probably offside when he headed in Stoke\u2019s first goal at Wigan, from an inch in front of the line and a foot behind the goalkeeper, but it counts, and they\u2019re 0-1 up. Extra-tough luck for MK Dons: they\u2019re now losing, Scott Wagstaff volleying in a corner. Hull are two up now, David Milinkovic turning in the rebound after his own shot is saved, and they appear to be making muffins of this potential banana skin. Tough luck for MK Dons, who put the ball in the AFC Wimbledon net but the referee had already pointed to the spot for a penalty. That\u2019s one to keep for future refereeing courses, as how not to play advantage. Or how not to not play advantage. Anyway, a poor decision. And so was the decision to let Conor McGrandles take it, as he thrashed it over the bar! Rotherham have raced into a 2-0 lead at Shrewsbury, with only three minutes played. Kyle Vassell with the second goal there. Rosenborg are 3-1 up against Maribor, a repeat of the scoreline from the first leg, with the game in stoppage time. A 6-2 aggregate victory will be wrapped up at any moment. Hull City\u2019s all-changed line-up hasn\u2019t held them back: they\u2019re already winning! The clock strikes 7.45pm, if such a thing is possible, and most of tonight\u2019s Carabao Cup matches are under way! Also making 11 changes tonight: Derby, Hull and Swansea. Possibly more that I haven\u2019t spotted. Last time MK Dons visited Wimbledon, the hosts referred to them on the scoreboard and in the programme only as MK, which landed them in hot water with the EFL. So tonight there will be no match programme at all. Apoel have indeed won 2-0, so they\u2019re through to the Champions League knockout round. Elsewhere, Rosenborg have taken a 2-1 lead over Maribor. Their aggregate advantage is 5-2, which with 25 minutes to play should be more than enough. The first result of the evening is just five minutes away, unless Qarabag score and take it to extra time: Apoel have come back from a 2-1 first-leg deficit to lead 2-0 on the night and 3-2 on aggregate. The other four Champions League games already ongoing are being drawn. Blackburn are winning the Carabao Cup team changeathon, with the full house of 11 changes. Team news is flooding in. There are a few too many games for me to feature them all, but do let me know if you\u2019ve got any requests. Until then, here\u2019s Celtic\u2019s line-up: It\u2019s a bumper evening of Uefa-endorsed, Carabao-flavoured action and no mistake. There are no less than 33 Carabao Cup fixtures, unless I\u2019ve miscounted in which there might be less than 33 fixtures, with stand-out ties including the alphabetically first, between AFC Wimbledon and those nefarious history-thieves the MK Dons, and Leeds\u2019 trip to Mancunian upstarts Salford. Plus there are Champions League and Europa League qualifiers to sprinkle a little stardust over proceedings. Here, then, is a complete list of tonight\u2019s fixtures (except for those that are already finished; all 7.45pm BST kick-offs except for the ones that say otherwise): Champions League third qualifying round, second leg Ajax v PAOK (7.30pm; 2-2 in the first leg) Celtic v CFR Cluj (1-1 in the first leg) Dynamo Kiev v Club Brugge (6.30; Brugge lead 1-0 after the first leg) Copenhagen v Red Star Belgrade (7pm; 1-1 in the first leg) Porto v Krasnodar (8pm; Porto lead 1-0) Rosenborg v Maribor (6pm; Rosenborg lead 3-1) Ferencvaros v Dinamo Zagreb (7pm; 1-1 in the first leg) LASK Linz v Basel (7.30; Lask lead 2-1 from the first leg) Olympiakos v Istanbul Basaksehir (7.30; Olympiakos won the first leg 1-0)) Europa League third qualifying round, second leg Dundalk v Slovan Bratislava (8pm; Dundalk trail 0-1) Linfield v Sutjeska (Linfield lead 2-1) Carabao Cup first round AFC Wimbledon v Milton Keynes Dons Accrington Stanley v Sunderland Barnsley v Carlisle Blackburn v Oldham Blackpool v Macclesfield Bradford v Preston North End Brentford v Cambridge Utd Bristol Rovers v Cheltenham Charlton v Forest Green Colchester v Swindon Coventry v Exeter Gillingham v Newport County Grimsby v Doncaster Huddersfield v Lincoln City Luton v Ipswich Mansfield v Morecambe Middlesbrough v Crewe Nottm Forest v Fleetwood Town Oxford Utd v Peterborough Plymouth v Leyton Orient Port Vale v Burton Albion QPR v Bristol City Rochdale v Bolton Salford City v Leeds Scunthorpe v Derby Shrewsbury v Rotherham Stevenage v Southend Swansea v Northampton Tranmere v Hull Walsall v Crawley Town West Brom v Millwall (8pm) Wigan v Stoke Wycombe v Reading While I\u2019m publishing enormous lists, the draw for the second round of the Carabao Cup, featuring 13 Premier League clubs, will take place following the conclusion of the Salford game. If you plan to stick around for that, you might find the ball numbers handy: South section 1 AFC Bournemouth 2 Brighton &amp; Hove Albion 3 Cardiff City 4 Crystal Palace 5 Fulham 6 Norwich City 7 Southampton 8 Watford 9 West Ham United 10 Portsmouth 11 Colchester United/Swindon Town 12 AFC Wimbledon/MK Dons 13 Oxford United/Peterborough United 14 Queens Park Rangers/Bristol City 15 Plymouth ArgyleLeyton Orient 16 Wycombe Wanderers/Reading 17 Charlton Athletic/Forest Green Rovers 18 Gillingham/Newport County 19 Stevenage/Southend United 20 Luton Town/Ipswich Town 21 Walsall/Crawley Town 22 Bristol Rovers/Cheltenham Town 23 Brentford/Cambridge United 24 Coventry City/Exeter City 25 Swansea City/Northampton Town 26 West Bromwich Albion/Millwall North Section 1 Aston Villa 2 Burnley 3 Everton 4 Leicester City 5 Newcastle United 6 Sheffield United 7 Tranmere Rovers/Hull City 8 Grimsby Town/Doncaster Rovers 9 Wigan Athletic/Stoke City 10 Port Vale/Burton Albion 11 Nottingham Forest/Fleetwood Town 12 Bradford CityPreston North End 13 Blackpool/Macclesfield Town 14 Blackburn Rovers/Oldham Athletic 15 Mansfield Town/Morecambe 16 Accrington Stanley/Sunderland 17 Scunthorpe United/Derby County 18 Rochdale/Bolton Wanderers 19 Huddlesfield Town/Lincoln City 20 Middlesbrough/Crewe Alexandra 21 Shrewsbury Town/Rotherham United 22 Sheffield Wednesday/Bury 23 Salford City/Leeds United 24 Barnsley/Carlisle United Right, that\u2019s all the important information dealt with.

      "bodyText": "The scene has been set for tense discussions in Tuvalu as Scott Morrison arrives on Wednesday, after his announcement of $500m in climate funding for the Pacific fell flat, with regional leaders saying that no matter how much money Australia put forward there was no excuse for not reducing emissions and closing coalmines. Though the Australian prime minister was not present for the start of the Pacific Islands Forum leaders\u2019 meeting on Tuesday, his country\u2019s presence at the forum has already been strongly felt, with Pacific leaders pointedly calling for Australia to transition rapidly away from coal use. Morrison\u2019s announcement of $500m over five years in climate resilience and adaptation funding for the region on Monday does not seem to have quietened concerns, with leaders saying the aid, while welcome, does not let Australia off the hook. Enele Sopoaga, the prime minster of Tuvalu and chair of the forum, said on Tuesday money was not enough. \u201cNo matter how much money you put on the table, it doesn\u2019t give you the excuse to not to do the right thing, which is to cut down on your emissions, including not opening your coalmines,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is the thing that we want to see.\u201d On Wednesday Morrison is expected to have bilateral meetings with Sopoaga, New Zealand\u2019s Jacinda Ardern and the prime ministers of the Cook Islands and Vanuatu. The leaders\u2019 retreat, the main event of the forum, will take place on Thursday. It is looking increasingly unlikely that Pacific island leaders, who are calling for commitments to urgent and significant action to tackle the climate crisis, and Australia will reach agreement on a communique that satisfies both groups. Pacific leaders have singled out Australia\u2019s coal policy and its use of carryover credits to meet its obligations under the Paris agreement as issues they want action on. But on Tuesday Alex Hawke, Australia\u2019s minister for international development and the Pacific, who has been in Tuvalu this week, said Australia would not be shifting from its policies. \u201cWe would be lying to say we\u2019re not disappointed, extremely disappointed,\u201d said Hilda Heine, president of the Marshall Islands, who has become a global leader on the issue of climate change. \u201cBecause Australia is part of the Pacific Islands Forum, they\u2019re the closest big country to the small Pacific island nations, they\u2019ve been here, they\u2019re here, they understand the situation. So it\u2019s very disheartening that their actions are not parallel with what we know they understand in terms of our situation.\u201d The urgency of the climate emergency is the focus of this year\u2019s forum.. A meeting of the Pacific small island states on Tuesday resulted in a declaration directly challenging some of Australia\u2019s policies, including calling for \u201can immediate global ban on the construction of new coal-fired power plants and coalmines\u201d and for all countries \u201cto rapidly phase out their use of coal in the power sector\u201d. Sopoaga said: \u201cWe must push forward and seek urgent actions, concrete actions from the global community. I certainly wish our colleagues from Australia and others, will take heed of this imperative, so we can move forward.\u201d Hawke said Australia was committed to meeting its Paris targets, and would use carryover credits to help it do so. \u201cAustralia\u2019s position has been clear and, look, there\u2019s been great respect for Australia\u2019s position in general.

The money will go toward resilience and adaptation measures in Pacific countries and comes from the existing aid budget, though Hawke would not be drawn about which aid programs would be cut to pay for the new climate and oceans initiative. \u201cThe aid budget works in a number of ways, we\u2019ll be reprioritising some of those needs over time,\u201d he said. \u201cAustralia is a good partner on climate because we understand from our neighbours the impact that it has.

It was the false prophets who came away with victory though, as MK Dons beat AFC Wimbledon on penalties to claim a fifth victory from the eight encounters between these most bitter of rivals.</p> \n<p>There had to be a fall guy and it was a particularly painful tumble for AFC captain Joe Pigott, who missed both the decisive spot kick and a penalty in normal time too. Conor McGrandles also missed a penalty, before going on to score MK Dons\u2019 first goal, an equaliser after Wimbledon had taken an early lead. The visitors claimed a wonderful second goal through teenager David Kasumu only for Luke O\u2019Neill to level again in added time. It really was as hectic as that reads.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt was a really good game of football, I really enjoyed it\u201a\u201d said the MK Dons manager, Paul Tisdale. \u201cThe start, the end and then the penalties.

For me, MK Dons are just another team. In fact, they\u2019re not even that.\u201d</p> \n<p>The historic enmity between these two teams doesn\u2019t need explaining. Some of their more recent disputes might, however. Like the incident at Kingsmeadow a year ago, when Wimbledon described their league opponents simply as \u2018MK\u2019 on both the scoreboard and programme cover. A charge of misconduct followed, then mediation, with the conclusion that Wimbledon must write MK Dons\u2019 name in full in future. This was the principle. In practice, the scoreboard wasn\u2019t working on the night and AFC, as is their right under EFL rules, chose not to publish a programme.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"fbd629aa-15fe-4703-9d30-b47fbdb195fc\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>North section</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Crewe v Aston Villa&nbsp;<br>Lincoln v Everton&nbsp;<br>Leeds v Stoke&nbsp;<br>Sheff Utd v Blackburn&nbsp;<br>Rotherham v Sheff Wed/Bury&nbsp;<br>Newcastle v Leicester&nbsp;<br>Burton v Morecambe&nbsp;<br>Burnley v Sunderland&nbsp;<br>Nottm Forest v Derby&nbsp;<br>Grimsby v Macclesfield&nbsp;<br>Preston v Hull&nbsp;<br>Rochdale v Carlisle&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>South section</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Plymouth v Reading&nbsp;<br>Crawley v Norwich&nbsp;<br>Newport v West Ham&nbsp;<br>Oxford v Millwall&nbsp;<br>Watford v Coventry&nbsp;<br>Swansea v Cambridge&nbsp;<br>Cardiff v Luton&nbsp;<br>Bristol Rovers v Brighton&nbsp;<br>Crystal Palace v Colchester&nbsp;<br>Fulham v Southampton&nbsp;<br>Bournemouth v Forest Green&nbsp;<br>Southend v MK Dons&nbsp;<br>QPR v Portsmouth</p>\n    <p><i>Ties to be played w/b 26 August</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>A spicy atmosphere off the pitch \u2013 including a tiny but particularly vocal travelling contingent of 280 \u2013 was matched on it. McGrandles was centre of attention in the first half. He was charged with taking a third-minute penalty but after a stuttering run-up fluffed his shot completely, sending it yards over the bar. Just five minutes later and McGrandles\u2019 miss was punished as Anthony Hartigan\u2019s corner was stroked home coolly on the volley by Anthony Wagstaff.</p> \n<p>This was the real stuff, every sprint, every touch, every challenge conducted with the maximum intensity. Both sides delivered flashes of decent play too, but it was MK Dons who were more composed on the ball and it did not take long for them to find an equaliser. Their marauding centre-half Regan Poole broke into the AFC box and cut the ball back low to the far post and where McGrandles found his own smooth finish across Nik Tzanev and into the net.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <strong>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</strong>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>MK Dons took the lead early in the second half through McGrandles\u2019 midfield partner Kasumu. Lurking on the edge of the box he received the ball from the left-hand side, steadied it with his first touch and curled it into the top corner with his second. It was an impressive strike from the teenager who was making only his seventh appearance in four seasons at the club.</p> \n<p>The action quickly switched up the other end again and AFC earned a penalty after Kwesi Appiah had his legs kicked out from underneath him. Pigott took the kick on and while there was no fancy run-up the outcome was just as dismal, a low effort with no power behind it that keeper Lee Nicholls claimed at his leisure.</p> \n<p>With the clock ticking into the last minute, AFC scrapped their way back level. A spell of determined play finally bore fruit when a flick on fell to full-back O\u2019Neill at the far post and he thrashed a shot past Nicholls. Penalties followed and while McGrandles converted his, Pigott could not. Under the blank scoreboard, the small MK Dons contingent went crazy.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u201cWe are the resurrection\u201d read a banner in the Chemflow End at Kingsmeadow. It was the false prophets who came away with victory though, as MK Dons beat AFC Wimbledon on penalties to claim a fifth victory from the eight encounters between these most bitter of rivals. There had to be a fall guy and it was a particularly painful tumble for AFC captain Joe Pigott, who missed both the decisive spot kick and a penalty in normal time too. Conor McGrandles also missed a penalty, before going on to score MK Dons\u2019 first goal, an equaliser after Wimbledon had taken an early lead. The visitors claimed a wonderful second goal through teenager David Kasumu only for Luke O\u2019Neill to level again in added time. It really was as hectic as that reads. \u201cIt was a really good game of football, I really enjoyed it\u201a\u201d said the MK Dons manager, Paul Tisdale. \u201cThe start, the end and then the penalties. I was really proud of the way we played, it was really gutsy and we finished the job \u2026 just.\u201d For Tisdale\u2019s opposite number the defeat wasn\u2019t too painful, or at least that was the way Wally Downes spun it. \u201cYou\u2019d like to win it but losing hasn\u2019t really bothered me too much\u201a\u201c he said. \u201cIt can\u2019t do when you lose on penalties. For me, MK Dons are just another team. In fact, they\u2019re not even that.\u201d The historic enmity between these two teams doesn\u2019t need explaining. Some of their more recent disputes might, however. Like the incident at Kingsmeadow a year ago, when Wimbledon described their league opponents simply as \u2018MK\u2019 on both the scoreboard and programme cover. A charge of misconduct followed, then mediation, with the conclusion that Wimbledon must write MK Dons\u2019 name in full in future. This was the principle. In practice, the scoreboard wasn\u2019t working on the night and AFC, as is their right under EFL rules, chose not to publish a programme. A spicy atmosphere off the pitch \u2013 including a tiny but particularly vocal travelling contingent of 280 \u2013 was matched on it. McGrandles was centre of attention in the first half. He was charged with taking a third-minute penalty but after a stuttering run-up fluffed his shot completely, sending it yards over the bar. Just five minutes later and McGrandles\u2019 miss was punished as Anthony Hartigan\u2019s corner was stroked home coolly on the volley by Anthony Wagstaff. This was the real stuff, every sprint, every touch, every challenge conducted with the maximum intensity. Both sides delivered flashes of decent play too, but it was MK Dons who were more composed on the ball and it did not take long for them to find an equaliser. Their marauding centre-half Regan Poole broke into the AFC box and cut the ball back low to the far post and where McGrandles found his own smooth finish across Nik Tzanev and into the net. MK Dons took the lead early in the second half through McGrandles\u2019 midfield partner Kasumu. Lurking on the edge of the box he received the ball from the left-hand side, steadied it with his first touch and curled it into the top corner with his second. It was an impressive strike from the teenager who was making only his seventh appearance in four seasons at the club. The action quickly switched up the other end again and AFC earned a penalty after Kwesi Appiah had his legs kicked out from underneath him. Pigott took the kick on and while there was no fancy run-up the outcome was just as dismal, a low effort with no power behind it that keeper Lee Nicholls claimed at his leisure. With the clock ticking into the last minute, AFC scrapped their way back level. A spell of determined play finally bore fruit when a flick on fell to full-back O\u2019Neill at the far post and he thrashed a shot past Nicholls. Penalties followed and while McGrandles converted his, Pigott could not. Under the blank scoreboard, the small MK Dons contingent went crazy.",

      "body": "<p>Week one as a competitive Premier League manager and Frank Lampard feels he has already experienced the rollercoaster that is life in charge of Chelsea. Not quite. It has been a week without highs so far. The first all-English Uefa Super Cup final offers the remedy and a potential platform for what lies ahead at Stamford Bridge. Liverpool sense opportunity to prolong the new Chelsea manager\u2019s uncomfortable ride.</p> \n<p>In J\u00fcrgen Klopp and his European champions, Lampard faces the highest calibre opponents of his short managerial career at Besiktas Park on Wednesday. Liverpool, who finished 25 points ahead of Maurizio Sarri\u2019s side last season, are a team primed to exploit the gaps and defensive vulnerabilities that contributed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/11/manchester-city-chelsa-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Chelsea\u2019s 4-0 defeat</a> in their Premier League opener at Manchester United on Sunday. The former Derby County manager insisted in Istanbul that the lessons have been learned.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/13/liverpool-adrian-unexpected-ascent-european-super-cup-final\">Liverpool\u2019s Adri\u00e1n keen to make the most of his unexpected ascent</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cWe need to be much better at not committing errors which lead to chances on the counterattack,\u201d he admitted; \u201cBecause all good teams will make it difficult if you do that.\u201d Liverpool especially.</p> \n<p>Klopp shares Lampard\u2019s opinion that the scoreline at Old Trafford did not reflect the contest. He also responded with some bemusement to a Turkish journalist who ventured that Liverpool were clear favourites to beat the Europa League winners in a city synonymous with their Champions League successes.</p> \n<p>\u201cChelsea are strong, young, fresh and in a really exciting moment with Frank there as a club legend trying to make his own name as a manager,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone at Chelsea is on their toes. This is the first trophy they can win together. That makes it really interesting. It is a really important game for us.\u201d</p> \n<p>For Liverpool, their sixth appearance in a Super Cup final is a chance to breed the winning habit after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/01/tottenham-liverpool-champions-league-final-match-report\" title=\"\">lifting their first trophy under Klopp</a> in Madrid in June and having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/04/liverpool-manchester-city-community-shield-match-report\" title=\"\">lost on penalties to Manchester City</a> in the Community Shield.</p> \n<p>For Chelsea and Lampard, who lost two Super Cup finals as a player with the club, the aims are more prosaic. A performance that does not invite doubts to fester over the club\u2019s enforced reliance on young, homegrown talent would be a welcome reaction to Old Trafford. The bonus of a European trophy in his first competitive week as Chelsea manager would, Lampard believes, have a lasting effect on a new-look team seeking to close the gap on Liverpool and City this season.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5ebc5b15-9ae8-4900-b4d3-35e697e775fd\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gy3fJxMTfkg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThis game means a lot to the club,\u201d he explained. \u201cI know first hand because I lost two Super Cup finals. We lost to Atl\u00e9tico in poor circumstances when we were far, far off and gave them the Super Cup. We were unfortunate to lose to [Bayern] Munich. When you work hard to get into this game between two champions it is important at a club like Chelsea that you give everything to win it. It means something to us as a club because it is another trophy and, for me, it would be a really nice start personally. But more than that it would give a really good feeling for the players with the season coming up that we can compete with Liverpool. If we win a cup that goes down in our history it gives the belief that we can go on from there. Certainly we understand the importance of it.\u201d</p> \n<p>It was not merely the United result that has complicated Lampard\u2019s first week. He left N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 on the bench at Old Trafford due to an injury-hit pre-season. The influential midfielder came on to try to limit the damage being inflicted only to pick up an ankle problem that makes him doubtful for this match. Added to the transfer ban, the loss of an experienced defender in David Luiz, the team\u2019s most creative talent in Eden Hazard and injuries to Willian plus Antonio R\u00fcdiger, and the Chelsea manager is having to adapt as rapidly to changing circumstances as his players.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/12/jurgen-klopp-wants-liverpool-to-stay-greedy-before-super-cup-final\">J\u00fcrgen Klopp wants Liverpool to 'stay greedy' for Super Cup final</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Lampard concedes: \u201cThis week is a good example of that rollercoaster, but I had a year at Derby last season where I had similar rollercoasters. I think that comes with managers\u2019 jobs, particularly at clubs like Chelsea, Liverpool, Man City \u2013 all the bigger teams. But I\u2019m very prepared for that. It has been a week where a lot has happened but I was ready for that and I certainly don\u2019t fear that. There are challenges every day in this job.\u201d</p> \n<p>Klopp\u2019s problems are minor by comparison. He will be without his first-choice goalkeeper Alisson until September with a calf injury and Naby Ke\u00efta raised fresh concerns over his fitness on Tuesday when he limped out of the pre-match training session. Istanbul represents \u201ca special place for every Liverpool supporter,\u201d said Klopp but, 14 years on from their fifth Champions League triumph, it is the setting for the six-times winners to show their appetite for silverware is as great as ever.</p> \n<p>The Liverpool manager said: \u201cWe won one competition last year, that\u2019s all, so how could we change our mentality? This team is built for being successful and this final is another chance for us. For me it was important we showed in the Man City game that we were there to win. With a bit of luck in that game we could have won it. It was obvious we wanted to win the trophy and now we have to prove that again.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Week one as a competitive Premier League manager and Frank Lampard feels he has already experienced the rollercoaster that is life in charge of Chelsea. Not quite. It has been a week without highs so far. The first all-English Uefa Super Cup final offers the remedy and a potential platform for what lies ahead at Stamford Bridge. Liverpool sense opportunity to prolong the new Chelsea manager\u2019s uncomfortable ride. In J\u00fcrgen Klopp and his European champions, Lampard faces the highest calibre opponents of his short managerial career at Besiktas Park on Wednesday. Liverpool, who finished 25 points ahead of Maurizio Sarri\u2019s side last season, are a team primed to exploit the gaps and defensive vulnerabilities that contributed to Chelsea\u2019s 4-0 defeat in their Premier League opener at Manchester United on Sunday. The former Derby County manager insisted in Istanbul that the lessons have been learned. \u201cWe need to be much better at not committing errors which lead to chances on the counterattack,\u201d he admitted; \u201cBecause all good teams will make it difficult if you do that.\u201d Liverpool especially. Klopp shares Lampard\u2019s opinion that the scoreline at Old Trafford did not reflect the contest. He also responded with some bemusement to a Turkish journalist who ventured that Liverpool were clear favourites to beat the Europa League winners in a city synonymous with their Champions League successes. \u201cChelsea are strong, young, fresh and in a really exciting moment with Frank there as a club legend trying to make his own name as a manager,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone at Chelsea is on their toes. This is the first trophy they can win together. That makes it really interesting. It is a really important game for us.\u201d For Liverpool, their sixth appearance in a Super Cup final is a chance to breed the winning habit after lifting their first trophy under Klopp in Madrid in June and having lost on penalties to Manchester City in the Community Shield. For Chelsea and Lampard, who lost two Super Cup finals as a player with the club, the aims are more prosaic. A performance that does not invite doubts to fester over the club\u2019s enforced reliance on young, homegrown talent would be a welcome reaction to Old Trafford. The bonus of a European trophy in his first competitive week as Chelsea manager would, Lampard believes, have a lasting effect on a new-look team seeking to close the gap on Liverpool and City this season. \u201cThis game means a lot to the club,\u201d he explained. \u201cI know first hand because I lost two Super Cup finals. We lost to Atl\u00e9tico in poor circumstances when we were far, far off and gave them the Super Cup. We were unfortunate to lose to [Bayern] Munich. When you work hard to get into this game between two champions it is important at a club like Chelsea that you give everything to win it. It means something to us as a club because it is another trophy and, for me, it would be a really nice start personally. But more than that it would give a really good feeling for the players with the season coming up that we can compete with Liverpool. If we win a cup that goes down in our history it gives the belief that we can go on from there. Certainly we understand the importance of it.\u201d It was not merely the United result that has complicated Lampard\u2019s first week. He left N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 on the bench at Old Trafford due to an injury-hit pre-season. The influential midfielder came on to try to limit the damage being inflicted only to pick up an ankle problem that makes him doubtful for this match. Added to the transfer ban, the loss of an experienced defender in David Luiz, the team\u2019s most creative talent in Eden Hazard and injuries to Willian plus Antonio R\u00fcdiger, and the Chelsea manager is having to adapt as rapidly to changing circumstances as his players. Lampard concedes: \u201cThis week is a good example of that rollercoaster, but I had a year at Derby last season where I had similar rollercoasters. I think that comes with managers\u2019 jobs, particularly at clubs like Chelsea, Liverpool, Man City \u2013 all the bigger teams. But I\u2019m very prepared for that. It has been a week where a lot has happened but I was ready for that and I certainly don\u2019t fear that. There are challenges every day in this job.\u201d Klopp\u2019s problems are minor by comparison. He will be without his first-choice goalkeeper Alisson until September with a calf injury and Naby Ke\u00efta raised fresh concerns over his fitness on Tuesday when he limped out of the pre-match training session. Istanbul represents \u201ca special place for every Liverpool supporter,\u201d said Klopp but, 14 years on from their fifth Champions League triumph, it is the setting for the six-times winners to show their appetite for silverware is as great as ever. The Liverpool manager said: \u201cWe won one competition last year, that\u2019s all, so how could we change our mentality? This team is built for being successful and this final is another chance for us. For me it was important we showed in the Man City game that we were there to win. With a bit of luck in that game we could have won it. It was obvious we wanted to win the trophy and now we have to prove that again.\u201d",

Shari Redstone, the president of National Amusements, the Redstone family holding company that controls CBS and Viacom, said: \u201cI am really excited to see these two great companies come together so that they can realize the incredible power of their combined assets. My father once said \u2018content is king\u2019 \u2013 and never has that been more true than today.\u201d Viacom and CBS have struggled since their split, riven by family squabbles and scandal. Former CBS chief executive Les Moonves was among the prominent entertainment executives to see his career derailed amid #MeToo sexual misconduct allegations. After a five-month outside investigation, the board determined Moonves would not receive a $120m severance package. It concluded Moonves violated company policy and was uncooperative with an investigation into the allegations. Compared to Disney, which recently bought Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox assets and is soon to launch a streaming service, Disney+, and Netflix, with 151 million global subscribers, CBSViacom will still be a relatively small player. Despite that, the combined company is expected to enjoy greater leverage with advertisers and cable providers. \u201cThis comes down, in my view, to what are management\u2019s ambitions for the future,\u201d analyst Michael Nathanson told the Journal on Monday. \u201cThey have enough, together, to maintain CBS\u2019s ambitions of reaching 25 million direct-to-consumer subscribers by 2022. If they have a greater goal than that, then they probably do need to keep rolling up other assets.\u201d",

The billionaire sex offender was found dead on Saturday morning, having apparently hanged himself in his cell at the Metropolitan correctional center (MCC) in lower Manhattan. Donald Trump said earlier he wanted a full investigation into the circumstances surrounding Epstein\u2019s death, which came while the financier was awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. \u201cBasically what we\u2019re saying is we want an investigation,\u201d the president told reporters in New Jersey. \u201cI want a full investigation, and that\u2019s what I absolutely am demanding. That\u2019s what our attorney general, our great attorney general, is doing. He\u2019s doing a full investigation.\u201d Trump made the comments a day after the attorney general, William Barr, vowed to carry on the Epstein investigation. Barr has ordered the justice department\u2019s inspector general to look into the matter. Trump also defended his decision on Saturday to retweet an unfounded conspiracy theory from a conservative comedian named Terrence K Williams that Bill Clinton was involved in Epstein\u2019s death. \u201cHe\u2019s a very highly respected conservative pundit,\u201d Trump said of Williams. \u201cHe\u2019s a big Trump fan. And that was a retweet. That wasn\u2019t from me \u2026 So I think I was fine.\u201d Epstein, who once counted Trump and Clinton as friends, was arrested on 6 July and pleaded not guilty to charges of sex trafficking involving dozens of underage girls as young as 14. The 66-year-old had been on suicide watch, but a source familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity said he was not on watch at the time of his death. At the MCC, two jail guards are required to make separate checks on all prisoners every 30 minutes but that procedure was not followed overnight, according to the source. Guards on the unit are now suspected of falsifying log entries to show they were making the checks, according to another person familiar with the investigation. Surveillance video reviewed after the death showed guards never made some of the checks noted in the log, according to the person, who also was\u2019t authorized to disclose information and spoke to the Associated Press Tuesday on condition of anonymity. New York City\u2019s medical examiner has said an autopsy on Epstein was completed on Sunday, but the cause of death remained pending. A growing chorus of lawmakers has demanded that the government hold responsible people who allegedly helped Epstein engage in sex trafficking. Senator Ben Sasse, the Republican chairman of the Senate judiciary oversight subcommittee, called on Barr to void a 2008 agreement that Epstein entered into with federal prosecutors in Florida that has been widely criticized as too lenient. Under that deal, Epstein pleaded guilty to state prostitution charges and served 13 months in jail, but he was allowed to leave the detention facility regularly for his office.",

      "body": "<p>Self-help and motivational speaking have provided rich pickings for comedy over the years, and do so again in Anna &amp; Helen\u2019s debut Stuck in a Rat. Mind you, these two could joke about practically anything, I\u2019d guess, and make it funny. It\u2019s the way they tell \u2019em \u2013 with a delectable clownish touch and an expert deployment of the straight woman/funny woman dynamic.</p> \n<p>Once fellow members of Footlights, it\u2019s the first time Anna O\u2019Grady and Helen Cripps have performed as a duo, a decade or more into their acting careers. I hope it won\u2019t be the last. I loved their faux self-care seminar, inviting us to \u201chop aboard the rejuvenation train\u201d and haul ourselves out of our rat \u2013 or should that be rut, or some undiscovered word in-between? The show considers various means of doing so \u2013 travel, exercise, love \u2013 in direct address, video and song. (The pair are adroit multi-instrumentalists and singers-in-harmony.)</p> \n<p>The joke is that Anna and Helen are klutzes, ill-equipped to fix their own lives, far less anyone else\u2019s. They bump into one another; they try to speak in sync, and fail. Anna is the worst offender; Helen is forever pulling her back into line. And O\u2019Grady plays the fool \u2013 wide-eyed, always puzzled by why things aren\u2019t quite working as they should \u2013 with a lovely light touch.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\">

      "bodyText": "Self-help and motivational speaking have provided rich pickings for comedy over the years, and do so again in Anna &amp; Helen\u2019s debut Stuck in a Rat. Mind you, these two could joke about practically anything, I\u2019d guess, and make it funny. It\u2019s the way they tell \u2019em \u2013 with a delectable clownish touch and an expert deployment of the straight woman/funny woman dynamic. Once fellow members of Footlights, it\u2019s the first time Anna O\u2019Grady and Helen Cripps have performed as a duo, a decade or more into their acting careers. I hope it won\u2019t be the last. I loved their faux self-care seminar, inviting us to \u201chop aboard the rejuvenation train\u201d and haul ourselves out of our rat \u2013 or should that be rut, or some undiscovered word in-between? The show considers various means of doing so \u2013 travel, exercise, love \u2013 in direct address, video and song. (The pair are adroit multi-instrumentalists and singers-in-harmony.) The joke is that Anna and Helen are klutzes, ill-equipped to fix their own lives, far less anyone else\u2019s. They bump into one another; they try to speak in sync, and fail. Anna is the worst offender; Helen is forever pulling her back into line. And O\u2019Grady plays the fool \u2013 wide-eyed, always puzzled by why things aren\u2019t quite working as they should \u2013 with a lovely light touch. I could watch their \u201cglass half full\u201d routine over and over again. Then there\u2019s the moment when Helen, having played a word association game with the audience, asks daydreamy Anna if she\u2019s noted down the responses. The pause \u2013 and her expression! \u2013 as she weighs up how to answer (shameful truth or out-on-a-limb white lie?) is comic bliss.

In his letter, shared with the Guardian, the Labour mayor writes to Robert Evans, the chief executive of the King\u2019s Cross development, to \u201crequest more information about exactly how this technology is being used\u201d. Khan also asks for \u201creassurance that you have been liaising with government ministers and the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office to ensure its use is fully compliant with the law as it stands\u201d. The owner of King\u2019s Cross is one of the first property companies to acknowledge it is deploying facial recognition software, even though it has been criticised by human rights group Liberty as \u201ca disturbing expansion of mass surveillance\u201d. But the company has provided little detail of how the software is used beyond saying it employed \u201ca number of detection and tracking methods, including facial recognition\u201d in its CCTV systems.

Camden council, the local authority in which King\u2019s Cross falls, and whose headquarters is also in one of the development\u2019s buildings, said the use of CCTV and facial recognition software had to be seen to be accountable. A spokesperson for the Labour-run authority added: \u201cThe public will want to be reassured that they are not being monitored inappropriately \u2013 as do we.\u201d Insiders said that Camden had first learned of the use of facial-recognition technology on its doorstep in media reports.

The donors included the private equity firm boss Hazem Ben-Gacem, who donated \u00a325,000, and the Carphone Warehouse co-founder David Ross, who gave \u00a310,000. The register also shows Johnson declared a new 50% share in a home in London, likely to be a house in Camberwell, south-east London, that he has reportedly bought with his partner, Carrie Symonds. In the final declaration of leadership donations, Johnson was marginally beaten by his rival, Jeremy Hunt, who attracted more than \u00a339,000. His donors included the former Conservative party co-treasurer James Lupton, and the private investment firm Aquind, co-run by the Russian Alexander Temerko, who opposes a hard Brexit. The register also shows the activities of some of the Conservative MPs pushed out by Johnson: both Theresa May and the former justice secretary David Gauke declared \u00a3600 ticket and hospitality packages for the England-Ireland cricket Test match at Lord\u2019s on 25 July, the day the new prime minister took over. The pair were pictured enjoying themselves at the game, along with the former business secretary Greg Clark, who has not yet declared the event. Johnson, Hunt and other candidates to replace May attracted significant donations over the campaign period, primarily from wealthy individuals connected to finance, banking and property. A Guardian analysis in July showed that of 27 individuals who donated to Johnson and could be identified, 11 worked in investment and asset management or similar jobs, four owned hedge funds and two were property developers. They gave more than \u00a3200,000 between them. Among the corporate donations, Johnson received seven separate contributions from the digger company JCB and its pro-Brexit boss, Anthony Bamford.",

Borrowers, on the other hand, would appear to have the whip hand. When a mortgage rate is negative, a borrower must still make monthly payments, but they pay back less than they owe. If the young borrow and the old save, this development must surely show that intergenerational transfers work in the direction of millennials and not, as more popularly argued, to the benefit of pensioners. In this vein, it\u2019s not unknown for pensioners to cite low savings rates as an outrage perpetrated by central banks that have a mission to favour the young over the old. Yet older homeowners miss a vital point, and one that is illustrated by the situation in Denmark, where house prices have risen consistently for decades and, as in most western European countries, stand at record highs. They kept rising, especially in the capital, Copenhagen, through the financial crash and beyond \u2013 and by more than 4% last year \u2013 because low interest rates made rising property values more affordable. Lower interest rates in Denmark mean that mortgages are effectively cheaper than they were 12 years ago. The knock-on effect is that without ultra-low borrowing rates, Denmark\u2019s overheated property market would long since have crashed, leaving long-term savers to suffer huge falls in asset values. Share prices would have followed and banks would have collapsed, as they always do in economies built on property wealth. The Danes might tax their citizens more and have a broader and deeper welfare state, but their economy is not so different to the UK\u2019s that the same issues cannot be seen in both countries.

Meanwhile, employers have pushed up the number of workers employed on zero-hours contracts by more than 100,000 since a year ago, to 896,000, just shy of the record 910,000 in 2016. Separate figures show that in-work training is recovering only slowly from worryingly low levels and investment by employers in new machinery and technology is declining. No wonder the latest employment figures show worker productivity, as measured by output per hour, has declined in each of the last four quarters. The one shining light was a rise in average pay by 3.9%, excluding bonuses, to an 11-year high. With consumer prices inflation at 2% in the second quarter, inflation-adjusted wages increased by 1.9%. Yet the bulk of the increase came from rises for those on the bottom pay scales, and only then because the government increased the national minimum wage this year for more than 2 million workers by 4.9%. About 7 million workers now directly or indirectly benefit from rises in the minimum wage. Pay rises for public sector workers in the spring, which were largely absent in previous years, also stand out as a fresh impetus for the rise in average regular wages. The squeezed middle kept being squeezed. And most economic forecasters look at the data and see a further weakening as the year wears on. Is this Brexit-related? Of course the uncertainty will have persuaded many employers to take on part-time staff rather than full-time. But most are still betting things will carry on as normal. Rightly or wrongly, they don\u2019t believe a Tory government would throw the economy under a bus on 31 October.",

Treasurer Josh Frydenberg is staying the course, grimly determined to deliver the promised budget surplus for 2019-20 and insisting the government\u2019s \u201csettings are right\u201d. In an email, the treasurer told Guardian Australia the official outlook was \u201csupported by lower interest rates, the recent tax cuts, a depreciation of the Australian dollar, a brighter outlook for investment in the resources sector, some stabilisation of the housing market and ongoing high levels of investment in infrastructure\u201d. Joiner, too, tips next month\u2019s growth figures for the June quarter will show the per-capita recession is over. He says Australia has been \u201ca victim of its own success\u201d, riding favourable terms of trade without prosecuting a reform agenda that could lift productivity in key sectors like technology, finance or education. Until a positive reform agenda emerges, or unless Australia is rocked by crisis, the economic outlook appears confoundingly, painfully flat.",

It will reinforce the expert view that Labor\u2019s election pledge to set a target of 50% new car sales being electric by 2030 would not have been that significant a shift from a path the country is already on. Labor\u2019s commitment prompted the prime minister, Scott Morrison, to accuse the opposition of wanting to \u201cend the weekend\u201d by forcing people out of four-wheel drives and the minister for small business, Michaelia Cash, to tell tradies only the Coalition would \u201csave their utes\u201d. The government has said it will introduce a national electric vehicle strategy to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 10m tonnes by 2030, but is yet to release details. A report published by the government\u2019s Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economies examines the uptake of electric vehicles in 22 countries.

It considered introducing the same vehicle emission standard proposed by Labor, requiring light cars to emit an average 105 grams of CO2 per kilometre, and received advice it would result in a net economic benefit, but decided against introducing the policy.

Australia\u2019s spy agency made the warning in a submission to the press freedom inquiry, due to hear on Wednesday from the Australian Federal Police, responsible for the high-profile raids on the News Corp journalist Annika Smethurst and the headquarters of the ABC. The submission \u2013 which Asio first asked to be kept secret before agreeing to make it public \u2013 echoes warnings from Asio director general Duncan Lewis when parliament was considering defences for journalists in espionage laws passed last year. Asio told the inquiry that its jurisdiction with respect to journalists is \u201cexceptionally limited\u201d and is confined to gathering information in circumstances such as where a journalist engages in foreign interference, accesses classified information or a hostile actor uses \u201cthe cover of journalism to pursue activities relevant to security\u201d. Asio noted Lewis\u2019 evidence that journalists were frequently targeted by foreign agencies, citing an article by the Australian Financial Review\u2019s Angus Griggs in which he revealed a Chinese agent tried to recruit him to pass on information about stories on Chinese cyber hacking and industrial espionage. \u201cIn Australia today, journalism is being used as cover by hostile intelligence actors,\u201d Asio said, warning that there are \u201cmany similarities between the activities of journalists and foreign intelligence officers that make journalism a suitable cover for hiding intelligence activity\u201d. \u201cFor example, both occupations are inquisitive, both require access to people, places and sensitive information, and both involve analysis of issues of interest to the public. \u201cAsio considers that additional legal exemptions or carve-outs, for journalists or the work of the media, would provide more opportunities for potential exploitation by hostile actors and could present an increased challenge for Asio in performing its functions to protect Australia from threats to national security.\u201d Asio credited the media for \u201cexposing espionage and acts of foreign interference in Australia\u201d and for self-reporting approaches from foreign spies, but said there is \u201ca risk that not all approaches will be rejected or reported to appropriate authorities\u201d. Asio warned that journalists are unable to assess whether publishing classified information could harm a sensitive source or capability \u201cbecause the sensitivity relates to the method by which the underlying intelligence was collected, not to the content of the document itself\u201d. Asio said the issue of warrants and use of special powers are already subject to \u201crobust accountability and oversight mechanisms\u201d, citing the fact journalist information warrants are needed to access metadata. On Tuesday the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security heard that the attorney\u2019s general department had warned Channel Nine to consider whether a story about the One Nation candidate Steve Dickson misbehaving in a strip club may have made it an agent of foreign influence because of the involvement of Al Jazeera. On Wednesday the committee will hear from the Australian Federal Police\u2019s outgoing commissioner Andrew Colvin, the departments of home affairs and the attorney general, intelligence agencies and the commonwealth ombudsman.",

      "bodyText": "Scott Morrison has vowed to take action on Australia\u2019s recycling crisis, flagging creating a domestic industry and an end to exporting waste. The prime minister is concerned that only 12% of the plastic that Australians put into their kerbside bins is being recycled, and is \u201cangry\u201d the public is being let down. \u201cThe promise to them is being broken and we have to keep that promise,\u201d he said on Tuesday. The 12% figure is included in a report by the environment department and Blue Environment Pty Ltd last year, which outlines the challenge facing Australia\u2019s waste recovery efforts. How much waste does Australia produce? The report found that in 2016-17 Australia generated an estimated 67m tonnes of waste, almost 2,700kg for each person. Most of this comes from the commercial and industrial sectors and construction and demolition, but about 560kg for each person comes from households and local government. And each person generates about 103kg of plastic each year. Nationally we use 3.3bn plastic bags, 2.6bn coffee cups, 2.4bn plastic straws and 1.3bn plastic bottles each year. Australia produces more than 17m tonnes of masonry waste every year, 14m tonnes of organics, 12m tonnes of ash (from coal-fired power stations), 5.6m tonnes of paper and cardboard waste, and 5.5m tonnes of metal. Although waste per person is going down, Australia\u2019s population is growing so more is being generated. How much is being recycled? Compared with other developed economies, Australia generates more waste than average and recycles less. About 40% of what is called \u201ccore waste\u201d is recycled, but 21.7m tonnes still end up in landfill. Nationally the recycling rate is 55%, but the results vary dramatically across the states. South Australia is the best performer, with a recycling rate of 78%; the Northern Territory recycles just 11%; New South Wales 59%; Victoria 68%; Western Australia 53%; Tasmania 49%;Queensland 44%, and the Australian Capital Territory 49%. What do we recycle? Recycling rates are highest for metal: 90% is successfully reused. Masonry materials have a recycling rate of 72%, followed by paper and cardboard (60%), glass (57%), organics (52%), ash (43%) and hazardous waste (27%). Only 12% of plastic is recycled. This means that each year more than 2,000m kg goes to landfill. Why does so much plastic end up in landfill? There are two main problems dealing with plastic waste in Australia: no market and no infrastructure. New plastic is cheaper than recycling existing plastic, so there is no incentive for manufacturers to use recycled materials. Australia does not have processing plants like Asia that break the plastic down into flakes so it can be reused for manufacturing. Soft plastics are often not accepted for recycling by councils, but often end up \u201ccontaminating\u201d other plastic recyclables. And many councils do not offer kerbside recycling, particularly in regional areas. A government report on kerbside recycling released last year found only half of the 544 councils in Australia have a kerbside collection service that accepts all seven types of plastic, and only 10 local government areas accept all types of plastic and plastic bags. What about exports? Australia exports about 4.5m tonnes of waste to Asia each year, more than half of which is metal. At the Council of Australian Governments meeting last week, the states and territories agreed to end the practice, which means more waste will need to be dealt within Australia. What can be done? The Australian Council of Recycling is calling for \u201cbig dollars and deeds\u201d to follow the Morrison government\u2019s pledge. It wants to see financial support for reprocessing and remanufacturing infrastructure to ensure material can be recycled in Australia. It also wants the government to put in place procurement targets for government spending, particularly on roads, to create a market for recycled materials. Australia\u2019s plastic recycling rates could improve with government investment in plastics sorting and cleaning equipment to enable onshore recycling. The government is also being urged to look at the possibility of waste-to-energy projects. A national container deposit scheme was recommended by a Senate inquiry last year. What can you do? Australians following the three Rs \u2013 reduce, reuse, recycle \u2013 and it is a sound system.

In an interview with Guardian Australia, the ACCC chairman says the social media giant should have removed the bogus death tax claims in circulation during the federal election contest in May, given its own independent fact checking processes had found the material to be false. Sims said he felt more comfortable talking about processes necessary for dealing with disinformation on digital platforms than \u201copining on particular situations\u201d, but he said: \u201cIf you know the information is wrong it should be removed.

Guardian Australia has revealed as part of an investigation into the death tax misinformation that the Labor campaign pressed Facebook repeatedly to deal with the false claims shared on the platform during the federal election, and escalated their complaints in the final week. But the social media giant declined to play censor. Simon Milner, the Singapore-based vice-president of the social media giant in the Asia-Pacific, told Labor after the election in correspondence seen by Guardian Australia: \u201cWe do not agree that is is our role to remove content that one side of a political debate considers to be false\u201d. Milner confirmed in the same correspondence that Facebook\u2019s independent fact checking procedures had determined the death tax material was actually false, not just considered by Labor to be false. The Facebook executive said once the claims were found to be false on April 30, \u201cwe demoted the original posts and thousands of similar posts\u201d. Posts were demoted in Facebook\u2019s News Feed but not removed from the platform. Responding to Milner\u2019s arguments, Sims said Facebook \u2013 which has faced intense blowback in other jurisdictions \u2013 had been through a period where \u201cthey don\u2019t want to have to admit [disinformation on the platform] is false, and then say we aren\u2019t going to do anything about it. \u201cI think there was a time when they were in that mode, but they realise it\u2019s a bit tricky now, so they are hiding behind \u201cwho are we to judge, who are we to arbitrate\u201d to the point where Mr Zuckerberg is saying we want governments to arbitrate, and that is again palming off responsibility I think. \u201cThey have to take responsibility, and the idea that they can\u2019t; I understand they don\u2019t want to, but I reject the fact that they can\u2019t. \u201cThey can. They have massive technology. They can do all this stuff. They just don\u2019t want to do it because it would damage their bottom line.\u201d Facebook is firmly in the sights of Australia\u2019s competition and consumer regulator as a consequence of its landmark review of digital platforms. One of the recommendations of the ACCC review, released in late July, was digital platforms be required to implement a code of conduct to govern how they handled complaints about the spread of inaccurate information, which would be registered and enforced by an independent regulator such as the Australian Communications and Media Authority. Sims said implementing that recommendation would change behaviour. \u201cThey can take responsibility by having a code about how they deal with disinformation, how they deal with copyright, having an ombudsman with the power to determine what should happen with a complaint. \u201cOne of those three headings would deal with the [death tax case study] or if one judges that a narrow interpretation of our recommendations wouldn\u2019t quite get you there in that situation because it\u2019s more a political thing than a commerce thing, [the regulatory structure] could be easily adjusted to deal with that.\u201d Sims was clear that in order to force behavourial change, \u201cthe codes have got to be compulsory, they\u2019ve got to be enforceable and there\u2019s got to be penalties for breaching them. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be like the food and grocery code, which has no penalties for breaching it, and is a very bad governance model, that requires you to do something but there are no consequences if you don\u2019t do it. \u201cThat to me just erodes public faith in government.\u201d He said if the Morrison government\u2019s response to the digital platforms review was to implement a process where the platforms were accountable to independent regulators, and that would be \u201ca great step forward from where we are now\u201d. \u201cIt might not be the end game. Things can evolve if that doesn\u2019t work as well as we\u2019d hoped, if there are complex judgments that the regulator and the companies can\u2019t make, then we may need to look again.\u201d In a recent interview with Guardian Australia, the communications minister Paul Fletcher said he has some sympathy with Facebook arguing it is not responsible for taking down lies circulating on its platform, because the social media giant does not hold itself out as a traditional media publisher with editorial standards. Fletcher said he wasn\u2019t inclined towards establishing \u201can Australian government office of truth verification, and this office would be charged with putting a tick or a cross against items on social media, and then, inevitably, against items on conventional media\u201d. \u201cThat is clearly not a workable solution and it creates more problems than it solves.\u201d But the minister flagged changes to ensure the social media giant was required to help its users better assess the veracity of content. In response to a question about whether the experience of the 2019 election and the election before, where Labor unleashed the \u201cMediscare\u201d campaign against the Coalition, whether it was now time to consider requiring truth in political advertising, Sims said he didn\u2019t want to \u201cget ahead of ourselves\u201d. \u201cIt could be that the issues raised by Facebook and Google accelerate that issue and make it more urgent to do something \u2013 but that\u2019s down the track.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s not quite up there with Watford\u2019s Gary Plumley but when Adri\u00e1n takes his place in goal for Liverpool in the European Super Cup final in Istanbul on Wednesday night, he will have completed a rapid rise from training with a semi-professional team in his homeland just a few weeks ago as he tried to keep in shape. Having run down his contract and left West Ham after six years in London, the 32-year-old goalkeeper who made more than 100 appearances for the club spent a fortnight in July at the less than salubrious surroundings of the Manuel Leonardo Ventura stadium, 30 kilometres west of Seville. Born and brought up in the Andalucian capital and having made his name with Real Betis, Adri\u00e1n was keen to stay sharp and focused as his representatives sorted out his next move, even posting videos on social media of him training at the Uni\u00f3n Deportiva Pilas \u2013 who ply their trade in Primera Andaluza, the sixth tier of Spanish football. \u201cIn gratitude for your hospitality and availability, I want to present UD Pilas club with this gift voucher for sports materials and equipment to continue growing,\u201d he said in a handwritten note after his departure at the end of July. \u201cThank you so much for everything! I wish you all the best.\u201d Within five days, Adri\u00e1n\u2019s move to Anfield \u2013 on what is believed to be a two-year contract with an option for an additional season \u2013 had been confirmed by Liverpool after Simon Mignolet was allowed to join Club Brugge. The Belgium international did not play a single minute in the Premier League last season but his replacement did not have to wait long for his opportunity when Alisson limped out of the opening match of the season against Norwich last week with a calf injury. \u201cIt\u2019s all a bombshell,\u201d Adri\u00e1n admitted in an interview with Radio Marca last week. \u201cI finished the season with my contract ending and knowing that I would have offers. But I didn\u2019t think I would have any at this level. I never imagined being able to play for the European champions at all. The last season at West Ham was one of the worst, especially for contractual issues. In the end everything went well.\u201d Yet while Plumley \u2013 a wine bar manager from Wales who was parachuted into Graham Taylor\u2019s team to face Tottenham in the 1987 FA Cup semi-final after untimely injuries to his two first-choice keepers \u2013 ended up buying himself a fridge after conceding four goals at Villa Park, J\u00fcrgen Klopp should have less cause to worry about his new recruit. Called up to the Spain squad in August 2016 by Julen Lopetegui, Adri\u00e1n has still to win an international cap but was a popular figure at West Ham until he was replaced by Lukasz Fabianski last summer. That his last appearance for Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s side came in the 4-2 defeat against the League One side AFC Wimbledon at the start of January \u2013 one of five he made all season \u2013 could mean there is still some rustiness but, having had to wait until he was 25 for his La Liga debut at Betis after six years in the club\u2019s reserve teams, the player who began his career as a striker for local side Altair is keen to make up for lost time. \u201cIt\u2019s always the same for a goalkeeper \u2013 you must seize the moment and stake your claim,\u201d Adri\u00e1n said in 2016. With Alisson set to miss at least the next few weeks including the trip to Southampton on Saturday and the home fixture with Chelsea seven days later, he will certainly get the opportunity.",

Downwards envy is a powerful force that entrenches power and privilege, channelling the anxieties of those who are struggling to resent any support for those who are actually going under. I\u2019ve witnessed the phenomenon in countless focus groups: talk about high level tax evasion, family trust rorts and executive salary and the conversation inevitably leads to hand-wringing about dole bludgers and single mothers who apparently breed to maximise their welfare cheque. It was a subtle force in the May election, where lower-income voters turned against a party that was vowing to close income loopholes for the wealthy to fund things like free dental for pensioners. Having emerged from the ballot as the champion of the ordinary battler, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, has been upping the ante, dismissing growing calls to raise Newstart as \u201cunfunded empathy\u201d while asserting a tax cut for the very rich is justified as a higher income is a sign someone is working harder. It\u2019s in this context that results in last week\u2019s Essential Report make for interesting reading because recognition that Newstart is too low is significantly stronger among lower-income earners. In a separate question, support for an increase in Newstart is running at 75%, again driven disproportionately by householders earning less than $52,000 a year, where support for a $75 bump is running at 80%. This seems to me evidence that the dynamics of welfare politics in Australia may be changing. And if I\u2019m right, it\u2019s because of the common lived experiences that drive empathy.

      "body": "<p>A new sperm separation technique may one day allow prospective parents undergoing IVF to choose whether they have a boy or a girl before fertilisation takes place, researchers say.</p> <p>Scientists in Japan have reported a new method which allows them to separate mouse sperm carrying an X chromosome from those carrying a Y chromosome, meaning that sperm can be selected based on whether they will result in female (XX) or male (XY) offspring when used to fertilise an egg.</p> <p>The researchers say they made their discovery as part of a project to unpick and understand the differences between sperm carrying an X chromosome or a Y chromosome, noting that the former carries far more genes than the latter.</p> <p> \u201cThis is first study to scientifically [show] the functional differences, [ie] fertilisation ability, between X-sperm and Y-sperm,\u201d said Masayuki Shimada, co-author of the research from Hiroshima University.</p> <p>The scientists say their work could also prove useful in agriculture. \u201cIn a dairy farm, the value of a female dairy cow is much higher than male, because milk is only produced by female cows,\u201d said Shimada. \u201cIn the case of beef meat production, the speed of growing is much higher in males after castration than females.\u201d</p> <p>While there are already existing methods such as flow cytometry that can be used to sort sperm, these are based on the relative size of the X and the Y chromosomes and are expensive. By contrast, the latest findings are based on differences in the movement of the two types of sperm, which the team suggests may be a cheaper and simpler technique.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/22/sex-selection-genitalia-uk-us-child-gender\">Sex selection is a false choice \u2013 our destiny is not defined by our genitalia | Ally Fogg</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Writing in the <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000398\">journal Plos Biology</a>, Shimada and colleagues report how they exploited the fact that X chromosomes bear far more genes than Y chromosomes and so can produce a different range of proteins, including certain receptors that can bind to specific substances.</p> <p>The team focused on two of these receptors, called TLR7 and TLR8. Both bind to a drug called Resiquimod \u2013 an antiviral and antitumour agent.</p> <p>The scientists found that when they exposed mouse sperm to a solution containing this drug, the velocity of some of the sperm was suppressed. The drug also reduced the percentage of sperm that, when placed in a test tube, swam upwards towards a nutrient-rich layer.</p> <p>As expected, it turned out that Resiquimod was specifically affecting the sperm carrying an X chromosome. However, the team found that Resiquimod did not damage these sperm or their ability to fuse with an egg.</p> <p>The researchers say their work suggests that by binding to the TLR7 and TLR8 receptors, Resiquimod affects the production of a substance called ATP that transports chemical energy around cells, lowering its levels and thereby reducing the swimming abilities of sperm with an X chromosome.</p> <p>Similar results were found for another drug that only binds to TLR7 receptors.</p> <p>The team found the method could be used to skew the odds of male and female offspring in mice.</p> <p>When sperm that swam upwards were used in IVF, 68 out of 77 embryos had an XY combination of chromosomes and, when 30 of these were transferred to mice, 83% of pups born were male. When samples enriched in X-chromosome sperm were used for fertilisation, the majority of embryos were XX and more than 80% of pups born were female.</p> <p>Shimada said the process may be applicable to humans and other species if the receptors are found to be present on human sperm.</p> <p>The team acknowledges that the possibility of using the technique in humans comes with ethical problems, though these are not new. Embryos produced through IVF can already be screened for their sex. While in some countries including the US parents can use this to choose the sex of their child, in the UK it is illegal to select which embryo to implant based on its sex unless there are medical reasons.</p> <p>Prof Robin Lovell-Badge, an expert in developmental biology at the Francis Crick Institute in London, said the research could prove very useful if similar effects are seen in farm animals. He added it may also help solve the puzzle of why, even in nature, sex ratios in some mammals can shift away from 50:50 under certain environmental conditions, noting there is some evidence that in humans stress can have such an effect.</p> <p>\u201cWhile the mice born after the sperm sorting apparently appeared normal, it would be essential to verify that there were no long-term effects of activating these receptors prior to fertilisation,\u201d he said. \u201cIn other words, do not try this at home in attempts to bias the likelihood of having a boy or a girl.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u2022 The headline of this article was amended on 16 August 2019 to refer to sex, rather than gender, selection.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A new sperm separation technique may one day allow prospective parents undergoing IVF to choose whether they have a boy or a girl before fertilisation takes place, researchers say. Scientists in Japan have reported a new method which allows them to separate mouse sperm carrying an X chromosome from those carrying a Y chromosome, meaning that sperm can be selected based on whether they will result in female (XX) or male (XY) offspring when used to fertilise an egg. The researchers say they made their discovery as part of a project to unpick and understand the differences between sperm carrying an X chromosome or a Y chromosome, noting that the former carries far more genes than the latter. \u201cThis is first study to scientifically [show] the functional differences, [ie] fertilisation ability, between X-sperm and Y-sperm,\u201d said Masayuki Shimada, co-author of the research from Hiroshima University. The scientists say their work could also prove useful in agriculture. \u201cIn a dairy farm, the value of a female dairy cow is much higher than male, because milk is only produced by female cows,\u201d said Shimada. \u201cIn the case of beef meat production, the speed of growing is much higher in males after castration than females.\u201d While there are already existing methods such as flow cytometry that can be used to sort sperm, these are based on the relative size of the X and the Y chromosomes and are expensive. By contrast, the latest findings are based on differences in the movement of the two types of sperm, which the team suggests may be a cheaper and simpler technique. Writing in the journal Plos Biology, Shimada and colleagues report how they exploited the fact that X chromosomes bear far more genes than Y chromosomes and so can produce a different range of proteins, including certain receptors that can bind to specific substances. The team focused on two of these receptors, called TLR7 and TLR8. Both bind to a drug called Resiquimod \u2013 an antiviral and antitumour agent. The scientists found that when they exposed mouse sperm to a solution containing this drug, the velocity of some of the sperm was suppressed. The drug also reduced the percentage of sperm that, when placed in a test tube, swam upwards towards a nutrient-rich layer. As expected, it turned out that Resiquimod was specifically affecting the sperm carrying an X chromosome. However, the team found that Resiquimod did not damage these sperm or their ability to fuse with an egg. The researchers say their work suggests that by binding to the TLR7 and TLR8 receptors, Resiquimod affects the production of a substance called ATP that transports chemical energy around cells, lowering its levels and thereby reducing the swimming abilities of sperm with an X chromosome. Similar results were found for another drug that only binds to TLR7 receptors. The team found the method could be used to skew the odds of male and female offspring in mice. When sperm that swam upwards were used in IVF, 68 out of 77 embryos had an XY combination of chromosomes and, when 30 of these were transferred to mice, 83% of pups born were male. When samples enriched in X-chromosome sperm were used for fertilisation, the majority of embryos were XX and more than 80% of pups born were female. Shimada said the process may be applicable to humans and other species if the receptors are found to be present on human sperm. The team acknowledges that the possibility of using the technique in humans comes with ethical problems, though these are not new. Embryos produced through IVF can already be screened for their sex. While in some countries including the US parents can use this to choose the sex of their child, in the UK it is illegal to select which embryo to implant based on its sex unless there are medical reasons. Prof Robin Lovell-Badge, an expert in developmental biology at the Francis Crick Institute in London, said the research could prove very useful if similar effects are seen in farm animals. He added it may also help solve the puzzle of why, even in nature, sex ratios in some mammals can shift away from 50:50 under certain environmental conditions, noting there is some evidence that in humans stress can have such an effect. \u201cWhile the mice born after the sperm sorting apparently appeared normal, it would be essential to verify that there were no long-term effects of activating these receptors prior to fertilisation,\u201d he said. \u201cIn other words, do not try this at home in attempts to bias the likelihood of having a boy or a girl.\u201d \u2022 The headline of this article was amended on 16 August 2019 to refer to sex, rather than gender, selection.",

The \u201cBasic Law\u201d constitution guarantees to protect, for the next 50 years, the democratic institutions that make&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;distinct from Communist-ruled mainland China.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2003:&nbsp;</b>Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s leaders introduce legislation that would forbid acts of treason and subversion against the Chinese government. The bill resembles laws used to charge dissidents on the mainland. An estimated half a million people turn out to protest against the bill. As a result of the backlash, further action on the proposal is halted.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2007:&nbsp;</b>The Basic Law stated that the ultimate aim was for&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s voters to achieve a complete democracy, but China decides in 2007 that universal suffrage in elections for the chief executive cannot be implemented until 2017. Some lawmakers are chosen by business and trade groups, while others are elected by vote. In a bid to accelerate a decision on universal suffrage, five lawmakers resign. But this act is followed by the adoption of the Beijing-backed electoral changes, which expand the chief executive\u2019s selection committee and add more seats for lawmakers elected by direct vote. The legislation divides Hong&nbsp;Kong's pro-democracy camp, as some support the reforms while others say they will only delay full democracy while reinforcing a structure that favors Beijing.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2014:&nbsp;</b>The Chinese government introduces a bill allowing Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;residents to vote for their leader in 2017, but with one major caveat: the candidates must be approved by Beijing. Pro-democracy lawmakers are incensed by the bill, which they call an example of \u201cfake universal suffrage\u201d and \u201cfake democracy\u201d. The move triggers a massive protest as crowds occupy some of&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s most crowded districts for 70 days. In June 2015,&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;legislators formally reject the bill, and electoral reform stalls. The current chief executive, Carrie Lam, widely seen as the Chinese Communist party\u2019s favoured candidate, is hand-picked in 2017 by a 1,200-person committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2019:&nbsp;</b>Lam pushes amendments to extradition laws that would allow people to be sent to mainland China to face charges. The proposed legislation triggers a huge protest, with organisers putting the turnout at 1 million, and a standoff that forces the legislature to postpone debate on the bills. After weeks of protest, often meeting with violent reprisals from the Hong Kong police, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/04/hong-kong-lam-to-withdraw-extradition-bill-say-reports\">Lam announced that she would withdraw the bill</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThe deployment of PLA troops, however controlled and contained it might seem, will mean the end of Hong Kong and its rapid decline,\u201d said Kenneth Chan, a political science professor at Hong Kong Baptist University.</p> \n<p>That would be a big hit for China at a damaging time.

      "bodyText": "Manchester City have avoided a transfer embargo from Fifa, instead being fined 370,000 Swiss francs (\u00a3314,000) for a breach of regulations regarding the recruitment of minors. City will be relieved not to receive the same sanction as Chelsea, who were unable to sign any players in the summer window after breaching the same rules. Instead, City will have to pay the fine and will be free to make fresh recruits in the winter window. Manchester City said: \u201cThe club accepts responsibility for the breaches which arose as a result of misinterpretation of the regulations in question. \u201cAll of the breaches occurred before December 2016 when guidance on the interpretation of the provisions was issued, since which date Manchester City has been fully compliant.\u201d A statement from the world governing body said: \u201cThe Fifa disciplinary committee has sanctioned English club Manchester City FC for breaches relating to the international transfer and registration of players under the age of 18. Manchester City FC was found to have breached, amongst others, article 19 of the Fifa regulations on the status and transfer of players. \u201cThe disciplinary committee took into account the fact that Manchester City FC accepted its responsibility and sanctioned the club with a fine of 370,000 Swiss francs. \u201cThe protection of minors is a key element in Fifa\u2019s overall regulatory framework relating to the transfer of players, and the effective enforcement of these rules is paramount, as has also been confirmed on various occasions by the court of arbitration for sport. The decision issued by the disciplinary committee was notified today.\u201d",

None of the properties occupied by Southern Housing Group\u2019s residents were directly damaged by the fire and so they are not being inspected by LBBD.

The government admitted in court it had botched its internal inquiry into claims of inappropriate conduct against Salmond while he was first minister, after he launched legal proceedings in 2018. Government lawyers said a senior human resources official overseeing the investigation into whether Salmond had broken its harassment rules had also spoken to the two complainants before the investigation began, making the investigation unlawful and \u201ctainted by apparent bias\u201d. In a statement on Tuesday, the Scottish government said: \u201cWe can confirm that final settlement of \u00a3512,250 has been made to Mr Salmond for legal costs arising from his petition for judicial review.\u201d The Scottish government has already said its own spending on external legal fees amounted to \u00a3118,523, taking its total legal bill to \u00a3630,773, excluding all its internal costs. That legal case is not directly related to the decision this year to prosecute Salmond on 14 alleged offences including two of attempted rape, nine of sexual assault, two of indecent assault and one of breach of the peace. Salmond has denied all the charges, with the case expected to be heard at the high court in Edinburgh in January 2020. However, the Police Scotland investigation was triggered by the decision by Leslie Evans, the permanent secretary at the Scottish government, to send the results of its internal inquiry to the police. The Scottish parliament has launched a separate special investigation into the decisions taken by Evans and other officials, as well as the role played by Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, during the internal inquiry. Sturgeon has admitted to meeting and talking to Salmond about the internal inquiry five times, including private meetings with him at her home which were set up by her chief of staff, Liz Lloyd.

      "body": "<p>When boxers go into a clinch it looks more like a tender embrace than a fight. The same is true of the clash between Labour and the Tories. There is no affection between England\u2019s heavyweight parties, but there is a kind of intimacy about the way they lean into their antagonism for tactical comfort.</p> <p>Boris Johnson is glad to have Jeremy Corbyn to campaign against, and the feeling is mutual. Fear of installing a radical socialist in Downing Street imposes discipline on Tory ranks, while the Conservative leader presents Labour with a caricature of its arch enemy \u2013 careless, heartless and posh.</p> <p>Both sides like politics that is binary and polarised. Traditional allegiances have been melting in the Brexit crucible, but whatever shape a constitutional crisis this autumn takes, it will culminate in the question of who should be prime minister. Corbyn and Johnson calculate that the smaller players \u2013 Liberal Democrats, the Brexit party, Scottish and Welsh nationalists, Greens, independents \u2013 will then be forced to line up behind either the Labour or Tory leader.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"efb7bdd0-68cd-42ac-97bd-926f21da1800\"         data-atom-type=\"timeline\"    > </gu-atom> </figure>   <p>Johnson is doing the better job of consolidating his side, poaching back supporters of Nigel Farage by promising them <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/05/no-deal-brexit-is-boris-johnsons-central-scenario-eu-told\" title=\"\">everything they want</a>. Corbyn has a fussier message, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/08/corbyn-johnson-plotting-abuse-of-power-to-force-no-deal-brexit\" title=\"\">opposing a no-deal Brexit</a> without rejecting the ambition to leave the EU. That drives remainers towards parties with less convoluted pro-European positions.</p> <p>There is polling evidence that voters\u2019 political identities are anchored more firmly on a remain-leave axis than traditional distinctions of left and right. It is less clear whether that realignment is robust enough to overcome an electoral system that \u2013 in England, at least \u2013 funnels votes into the usual blue and red buckets.</p> <p>The Lib Dem victory in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/02/brecon-radnorshire-byelection-lib-dems-jane-dodds-win-cuts-johnson-commons-majority-to-one\" title=\"\">Brecon and Radnorshire byelection</a>, achieved by the Green and Plaid Cymru candidates\u2019 withdrawal from the race, showed how it might be done. It was the prototype for a remain alliance general election ticket. Talks are under way to establish which seats might be nobbled with the same method and \u2013 trickier to negotiate \u2013 who should step aside for whom. That discussion is easily bogged down in local rivalries and historical vendettas. The Greens are wary, having put similar efforts into a \u201cprogressive alliance\u201d in 2017 and come away feeling that their cooperative spirit was not properly reciprocated by the Lib Dems. The lingering smell of coalition with the Tories also deters leftwing Green members from embracing Jo Swinson\u2019s party. There are petty tribalists on all sides who see prospective allies as chiselers or cranks.</p> <p>But Brexit is a powerful motivator. It helps that the Electoral Commission has approved use of a \u201cUnite to Remain\u201d label on ballot papers, alongside a party name. That eases the taboo for activists campaigning for candidates they are used to treating as rivals. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/03/forget-party-ties-unite-stay-in-eu\" title=\"\">Unite to Remain</a> umbrella also brings financial assistance from pro-European donors. Most ambitiously, there is tentative discussion of a common platform reaching beyond the European question. One model is a four-point agenda that, alongside a referendum, would include investment in public services (styled as an anti-austerity dividend made available by the cancellation of Brexit), electoral reform and ambitious de-carbonisation targets.</p> <p>The choreography is not simple. No party wants to look as if it is being led in the dance by a dominant partner. But it is heartening that committed pro-Europeans are thinking about coordinating policy steps when Tory campaign theme music \u2013 tough on crime, munificent with the NHS \u2013 is blaring out of every Downing Street window.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"903557b0c1cde70cbd691c0fd3af7a637db3cc79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/903557b0c1cde70cbd691c0fd3af7a637db3cc79/0_117_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Since Corbyn does not identify himself as a remainer, his diehard supporters are obliged to see remain itself as a suspicious category.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aaron Chown/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even if there is not a ballot in the autumn, it is good exercise for pro-European politicians to develop the muscles for climbing between political trenches. Voter aversion to Corbyn and Johnson has been fostered by Brexit, but is not limited to it. There is a cultural appetite for alternatives that will outlast any resolution to the EU question. The electoral territory of Remainia might refuse to be partitioned back into Labour and Tory possessions.</p> <p>That is Swinson\u2019s hope and the reason she bluntly rejects any notion of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/23/jo-swinson-rules-out-lib-dem-pact-with-labour-under-jeremy-corbyn\" title=\"\">supporting a Corbyn-led government</a>. Disgruntled Labour pro-Europeans have fuelled the Lib Dem renaissance so far, but when it comes to Westminster seats, a breakthrough must include liberal-minded Tories who are equally appalled by the Trumpian fever that has gripped the government and chilled by hard left fervour in Labour. Swinson also wants to persuade independent MPs in the Commons to follow Chuka Umunna\u2019s example and rebadge as Lib Dems. She can\u2019t attract refugees from Corbynism while flirting with support for a pro-Corbyn coalition somewhere down the line.</p> <p>For Labour, the Lib Dems have always been a contemptible nuisance: plastic progressives; squatters who make it harder to evict Tories from office. The remain alliance will be viewed the same way and attacked as enablers of conservatism. Some hostility is rational given that the project\u2019s purpose is to rival Labour for the status of principal national opposition. But giving venomous expression to that enmity is counterproductive. There is a strain of piety on the left that refuses to believe in valid political expressions of compassion that are not Labour-branded.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/13/caroline-lucas-no-deal-brexit-corbyn-green-party-labour\">If Caroline Lucas truly wants to stop a no-deal Brexit, she must work with Corbyn | Phil McDuff</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Since Corbyn does not identify himself as a remainer, his diehard supporters are obliged to see remain itself as a suspicious category \u2013 a tactical diversion by soulless centrists who cannot be sincerely worried about inequality or distressed by austerity because if they were they would surely be supporting Labour.</p> <p>Bolstered by that moral arrogance, the official opposition party expects \u2013 nay, demands \u2013 that pro-Europeans do their duty and get behind the Labour leader as the only feasible candidate to replace a wicked Tory. That is the way British politics has worked for the best part of a century. But Brexit has the makings of a 100-year storm. And while it is fanciful to imagine a remain alliance breaking the mould in a matter of weeks, believing it might be possible will give hope to a lot of voters. Because the alternative is watching Johnson and Corbyn slug it out, wishing they could somehow both lose.</p> <p>\u2022 Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "When boxers go into a clinch it looks more like a tender embrace than a fight. The same is true of the clash between Labour and the Tories. There is no affection between England\u2019s heavyweight parties, but there is a kind of intimacy about the way they lean into their antagonism for tactical comfort. Boris Johnson is glad to have Jeremy Corbyn to campaign against, and the feeling is mutual. Fear of installing a radical socialist in Downing Street imposes discipline on Tory ranks, while the Conservative leader presents Labour with a caricature of its arch enemy \u2013 careless, heartless and posh. Both sides like politics that is binary and polarised. Traditional allegiances have been melting in the Brexit crucible, but whatever shape a constitutional crisis this autumn takes, it will culminate in the question of who should be prime minister. Corbyn and Johnson calculate that the smaller players \u2013 Liberal Democrats, the Brexit party, Scottish and Welsh nationalists, Greens, independents \u2013 will then be forced to line up behind either the Labour or Tory leader. Johnson is doing the better job of consolidating his side, poaching back supporters of Nigel Farage by promising them everything they want. Corbyn has a fussier message, opposing a no-deal Brexit without rejecting the ambition to leave the EU. That drives remainers towards parties with less convoluted pro-European positions. There is polling evidence that voters\u2019 political identities are anchored more firmly on a remain-leave axis than traditional distinctions of left and right. It is less clear whether that realignment is robust enough to overcome an electoral system that \u2013 in England, at least \u2013 funnels votes into the usual blue and red buckets. The Lib Dem victory in the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection, achieved by the Green and Plaid Cymru candidates\u2019 withdrawal from the race, showed how it might be done. It was the prototype for a remain alliance general election ticket. Talks are under way to establish which seats might be nobbled with the same method and \u2013 trickier to negotiate \u2013 who should step aside for whom. That discussion is easily bogged down in local rivalries and historical vendettas. The Greens are wary, having put similar efforts into a \u201cprogressive alliance\u201d in 2017 and come away feeling that their cooperative spirit was not properly reciprocated by the Lib Dems. The lingering smell of coalition with the Tories also deters leftwing Green members from embracing Jo Swinson\u2019s party. There are petty tribalists on all sides who see prospective allies as chiselers or cranks. But Brexit is a powerful motivator. It helps that the Electoral Commission has approved use of a \u201cUnite to Remain\u201d label on ballot papers, alongside a party name. That eases the taboo for activists campaigning for candidates they are used to treating as rivals. The Unite to Remain umbrella also brings financial assistance from pro-European donors. Most ambitiously, there is tentative discussion of a common platform reaching beyond the European question. One model is a four-point agenda that, alongside a referendum, would include investment in public services (styled as an anti-austerity dividend made available by the cancellation of Brexit), electoral reform and ambitious de-carbonisation targets. The choreography is not simple. No party wants to look as if it is being led in the dance by a dominant partner. But it is heartening that committed pro-Europeans are thinking about coordinating policy steps when Tory campaign theme music \u2013 tough on crime, munificent with the NHS \u2013 is blaring out of every Downing Street window. Even if there is not a ballot in the autumn, it is good exercise for pro-European politicians to develop the muscles for climbing between political trenches. Voter aversion to Corbyn and Johnson has been fostered by Brexit, but is not limited to it. There is a cultural appetite for alternatives that will outlast any resolution to the EU question. The electoral territory of Remainia might refuse to be partitioned back into Labour and Tory possessions. That is Swinson\u2019s hope and the reason she bluntly rejects any notion of supporting a Corbyn-led government. Disgruntled Labour pro-Europeans have fuelled the Lib Dem renaissance so far, but when it comes to Westminster seats, a breakthrough must include liberal-minded Tories who are equally appalled by the Trumpian fever that has gripped the government and chilled by hard left fervour in Labour. Swinson also wants to persuade independent MPs in the Commons to follow Chuka Umunna\u2019s example and rebadge as Lib Dems. She can\u2019t attract refugees from Corbynism while flirting with support for a pro-Corbyn coalition somewhere down the line. For Labour, the Lib Dems have always been a contemptible nuisance: plastic progressives; squatters who make it harder to evict Tories from office. The remain alliance will be viewed the same way and attacked as enablers of conservatism. Some hostility is rational given that the project\u2019s purpose is to rival Labour for the status of principal national opposition. But giving venomous expression to that enmity is counterproductive. There is a strain of piety on the left that refuses to believe in valid political expressions of compassion that are not Labour-branded. Since Corbyn does not identify himself as a remainer, his diehard supporters are obliged to see remain itself as a suspicious category \u2013 a tactical diversion by soulless centrists who cannot be sincerely worried about inequality or distressed by austerity because if they were they would surely be supporting Labour. Bolstered by that moral arrogance, the official opposition party expects \u2013 nay, demands \u2013 that pro-Europeans do their duty and get behind the Labour leader as the only feasible candidate to replace a wicked Tory. That is the way British politics has worked for the best part of a century. But Brexit has the makings of a 100-year storm. And while it is fanciful to imagine a remain alliance breaking the mould in a matter of weeks, believing it might be possible will give hope to a lot of voters. Because the alternative is watching Johnson and Corbyn slug it out, wishing they could somehow both lose. \u2022 Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "George Monbiot is grossly unfair to describe as \u201cpathetic\u201d the new IPCC special report on climate change and land (Here\u2019s the true cost of eating meat. It\u2019s worse than you think, 9 August). There was no fear of the farming industry, nor any other pressure to suppress the science. Furthermore, the \u201cnot mentioned\u201d Nature paper on carbon opportunity costs is cited twice in chapter 5 of the report, and the considerable climatic advantages of reducing meat and dairy are explicitly assessed. Nevertheless, the priority must be to halt emissions from fossil fuels and deforestation, to avoid immediate carbon release. The recovery of carbon stocks through environmental restoration and dietary change are also highly desirable, yet are slower processes, with the former jeopardised by continued temperature increase. Dr Phillip Williamson University of East Anglia \u2022 I\u2019m fed up with George Monbiot and many others continually spouting about the evils of meat and dairy and the virtues of a plant-based diet. We can\u2019t all do it, George! After a kidney transplant I must keep strictly to a low oxalate diet to avoid kidney stones forming in my new kidney. Oxalate is present to varying degrees in almost all plants \u2013 in fact in just about anything that grows, including soya and other meat substitutes. Meat and dairy contain none. Once George and the other plant evangelists have achieved their objective of destroying the meat and dairy industries and returning the land to nature and wildlife, can he suggest how I am to keep body and soul together? Yvonne Ingham Leicester \u2022 The much-trumpeted IPCC report (Impact of global heating on land poses threat to civilisation \u2013 UN, 9 August) is disappointing. The threat has been known for years, and in 2018 the IPCC said we had 12 years to limit catastrophe. Among the recommendations for \u201cstrong action from governments\u201d, the report includes reforming farming subsidies and supporting small farmers, but it is weak on specifics. It points out that soil \u201cis being lost more than 100 times faster than it is being formed in ploughed areas, and 10 to 20 times faster even on fields that are not tilled\u201d. But there is no reference to conservation agriculture (CA), which nurtures the soil, encouraging water retention and CO2 absorption. What a wasted opportunity! CA is being increasingly practised around the world, with increased yields for both small and large farms; it has been called the most climate-friendly form of agriculture. But it is important to realise that CA is an ecosystem approach based on three interlinked principles: (i) continuous no or minimum mechanical soil disturbance; (ii) permanent maintenance of soil mulch cover; and (iii) diversification of cropping system. CA is present in all continents and all agricultural systems. Conservation tillage, reduced tillage and minimum tillage are not conservation agriculture, and nor is no-till on its own.

The prime minister was filmed saying \u201cyou\u2019re joking\u201d and shaking his head as he was shown a scan of a prisoner who had hidden a Kinder egg full of drugs inside their body.

Johnson\u2019s prisons announcement was one of a series of home affairs announcements in recent days, following No 10\u2019s focus last week on NHS funding. The prime minister is understood to have visited a Leeds hospital as well but that visit appeared to be closed to the media. No 10 civil servants could not confirm that Johnson had been to a hospital and met Conservative members on Tuesday, as the prison visit was the only official engagement and he had otherwise been making private and political visits. A senior Conservative source denied that Johnson was engaged in laying the ground for an election, insisting that his trip to Leeds was about setting out his domestic agenda before Brexit takes centre stage in the autumn. The former cabinet minister Damian Hinds accidentally posted a picture of his email inbox on the internet with a message from his local party talking about \u201cGE19\u201d, showing MPs are already beginning to prepare for the possibility of going to the polls. Suspicions about an election have been intensified by the amount of time Johnson is spending away from Downing Street on visits that allow for photo opportunities to drive home his messages, while his adviser, Dominic Cummings, and senior minister, Michael Gove, take control of planning for a no-deal Brexit. Jill Rutter, director of the Institute for Government, warned on Tuesday that people should not let Johnson off the hook on Brexit by focusing too much on how Cummings is trying to foil MPs stopping a no deal. \u201cSince the new government took over, all the excitement has been generated by one figure: Rasputin, Svengali, consigliere, \u2018vanguard and as yet sole member of the gilet noir\u2019, Dominic Cummings,\u201d she wrote in a blog. \u201cAnd instead of legislature versus executive, the autumn showdown has become Dominic Cummings versus Dominic Grieve\u2026 \u201cThe image of hardman Cummings whipping Whitehall into shape, while a beaming Johnson is on a splash and selfie tour on a virtual battle bus, suits both parties \u2013 but no one should fall for it.

The remarks by the two senior politicians at a round table on Wednesday are likely to spark anger from the Labour leadership. Swinson has previously ruled out working with the Labour leader, branding him a Brexiter who could not be trusted to fight for a second referendum to keep the UK in the EU. Senior Labour figures have made clear they would not countenance backing any unity government or coalition to stop no deal unless it was led by Corbyn, whom they argue is best placed to command an anti-no deal majority. Watson, speaking at an event hosted by For our Future\u2019s Sake and Our Future Our Choice \u2013 the two youth movements campaigning for a second referendum \u2013 said party lines should be irrelevant when it came to fighting to stop Boris Johnson forcing through no deal. \u201cEveryone who cares about democracy, our country and our future must work together because there are enough of us \u2013 from all parties in parliament \u2013 to stop him,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst, that means working together to stop no deal for which there is no majority in either parliament or the country.

And democrats have got to realise in this crisis that we\u2019re stronger together if we work together.\u201d Watson\u2019s remarks could be incendiary in Labour circles as they appear to undermine the tough stance taken by Corbyn and his allies who have insisted they would not back a unity government alternative to a general election, even if it had the sole aim of stopping no deal. Swinson said she was committed to \u201cworking with others across party lines in parliament to stop no-deal Brexit\u201d and said there was \u201cno time for tribalism\u201d \u2013 a coded warning to senior Labour figures such as John McDonnell or Rebecca Long-Bailey who have said Labour could not back moves led by those who would keep Corbyn out of No 10 if given the opportunity. \u201cThat is why I am pleased to be here today with Tom to show there is a desire across the political spectrum to stop Boris Johnson\u2019s reckless no-deal Brexit plan and instead deliver a brighter future inside the EU,\u201d she said. \u201cUltimately we need to secure a people\u2019s vote, stop Brexit and ensure that the rights and opportunities that the last generation have enjoyed are protected for the next.\u201d McDonnell has said he expects Labour to win any confidence vote against Johnson, though it is unclear when the party will attempt a vote when parliament returns from summer recess.

A lot of what he does is try to put you off in a way, trying to make it look extremely different so you have to think way outside the box. You look at his dismissals over a period of time, it\u2019s not far away from everyone else\u2019s \u2013 the movements before and after it might look slightly different but it\u2019s just being really clear on how we want to go about it.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we go to a plan, we\u2019ve got to be really ruthless with it and stick to it. [And also] to make sure if we\u2019re not getting him out, we\u2019re containing him and building pressure on him at the other end. I\u2019m expecting a big response from the boys this time around.\u201d</p> <p>Analysts noted that Smith made 23 idiosyncratic movements between deliveries during the last Ashes \u2013 a series he dominated with three centuries with an average of 137 \u2013 and shuffles back and across before meeting the ball, but England at least have fresh weapons with which to challenge the right-hander this week.</p> <p>While the more all-round Curran appears to be competing with Joe Denly for his place \u2013 England would move batsmen up to make the switch \u2013 the latter could also be retained if the expected rain reduces the length of match and thus the need for their spinner, Jack Leach.</p> <p>Archer is certain to play with the 24-year-old fast bowler having previously claimed that Smith avoided him in the nets while teammates at Rajasthan Royals. Root, without Jimmy Anderson after a calf injury, is keen to find out why.</p> <p>Asked if the extra pace might unsettle Smith, Root replied: \u201cIt could, potentially. You try and use your whole armoury in different ways. I\u2019m fully confident that the whole bowling group have got everything it takes to get every single one of their players out.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption><strong>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</strong></figcaption> </figure>  <p>On facing Archer, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s not always pleasant. But it\u2019s very exciting to stand at slip to and he\u2019s a very skilful young guy. He can swing the ball both ways. He\u2019s got a good bouncer and bowls at good pace consistently. So I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll cause problems on most surfaces. And hopefully, he can exploit this one this time around.\u201d</p> <p>Just as Australia\u2019s batting line-up is not solely about one man, nor should England\u2019s attack rest on the shoulders of a debutant. Root was coy about which of Archer, Stuart Broad and Chris Woakes would share the new ball but was happy to discuss the latter\u2019s record at Lord\u2019s, where he averages nine with the ball and 66 with the bat from four Tests.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/13/moeen-ali-taking-break-cricket-dropped-by-england-second-ashes-test\">Joe Root talks up Ashes return for Moeen Ali despite being dropped</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Root said: \u201cI don\u2019t think you really need to remind Chris of his record here \u2013 every time you walk through the dressing room you see his name at the bottom of the honours board a few times, especially in the bowling column. It\u2019s great when you\u2019ve got guys coming back to venues where they\u2019ve got really fond memories. It\u2019s really powerful and feeds a lot of confidence through him and the rest of the guys.\u201d</p> <p>Australia have rested James Pattinson from the side that won at Edgbaston in a bid to keep their attack fresh. There are three days between the second and third Tests, with Josh Hazlewood expected to be preferred to Mitchell Starc as the initial replacement seamer.</p> <p>For Tim Paine, who made his Test debut at Lord\u2019s alongside Smith in 2010 before seven years in the wilderness, a 2-0 lead would put him within touching distance of a remarkable feat as Australia captain, having rebuilt the team after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/24/cameron-bancroft-ball-tampering-claims-mar-south-africa-v-australia\" title=\"\">the ball-tampering scandal</a> last year.</p> <p>Paine said: \u201cI\u2019m rapped to be playing international cricket again and to have a second opportunity to have the captaincy is a great honour as well.

You look at his dismissals over a period of time, it\u2019s not far away from everyone else\u2019s \u2013 the movements before and after it might look slightly different but it\u2019s just being really clear on how we want to go about it. \u201cWhen we go to a plan, we\u2019ve got to be really ruthless with it and stick to it. [And also] to make sure if we\u2019re not getting him out, we\u2019re containing him and building pressure on him at the other end. I\u2019m expecting a big response from the boys this time around.\u201d Analysts noted that Smith made 23 idiosyncratic movements between deliveries during the last Ashes \u2013 a series he dominated with three centuries with an average of 137 \u2013 and shuffles back and across before meeting the ball, but England at least have fresh weapons with which to challenge the right-hander this week. While the more all-round Curran appears to be competing with Joe Denly for his place \u2013 England would move batsmen up to make the switch \u2013 the latter could also be retained if the expected rain reduces the length of match and thus the need for their spinner, Jack Leach. Archer is certain to play with the 24-year-old fast bowler having previously claimed that Smith avoided him in the nets while teammates at Rajasthan Royals. Root, without Jimmy Anderson after a calf injury, is keen to find out why. Asked if the extra pace might unsettle Smith, Root replied: \u201cIt could, potentially. You try and use your whole armoury in different ways. I\u2019m fully confident that the whole bowling group have got everything it takes to get every single one of their players out.\u201d On facing Archer, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s not always pleasant. But it\u2019s very exciting to stand at slip to and he\u2019s a very skilful young guy. He can swing the ball both ways. He\u2019s got a good bouncer and bowls at good pace consistently. So I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll cause problems on most surfaces. And hopefully, he can exploit this one this time around.\u201d Just as Australia\u2019s batting line-up is not solely about one man, nor should England\u2019s attack rest on the shoulders of a debutant. Root was coy about which of Archer, Stuart Broad and Chris Woakes would share the new ball but was happy to discuss the latter\u2019s record at Lord\u2019s, where he averages nine with the ball and 66 with the bat from four Tests. Root said: \u201cI don\u2019t think you really need to remind Chris of his record here \u2013 every time you walk through the dressing room you see his name at the bottom of the honours board a few times, especially in the bowling column. It\u2019s great when you\u2019ve got guys coming back to venues where they\u2019ve got really fond memories. It\u2019s really powerful and feeds a lot of confidence through him and the rest of the guys.\u201d Australia have rested James Pattinson from the side that won at Edgbaston in a bid to keep their attack fresh. There are three days between the second and third Tests, with Josh Hazlewood expected to be preferred to Mitchell Starc as the initial replacement seamer. For Tim Paine, who made his Test debut at Lord\u2019s alongside Smith in 2010 before seven years in the wilderness, a 2-0 lead would put him within touching distance of a remarkable feat as Australia captain, having rebuilt the team after the ball-tampering scandal last year. Paine said: \u201cI\u2019m rapped to be playing international cricket again and to have a second opportunity to have the captaincy is a great honour as well. It\u2019s certainly one I didn\u2019t want or expect but doing the job now, I\u2019m thoroughly enjoying it.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "ExxonMobil is planning a retreat from the North Sea with a $2bn (\u00a31.6bn) sale of its oil and gas fields after almost 50 years in the UK\u2019s oil basin. The world\u2019s largest listed company is in talks with a number of North Sea oil firms to sell the stakes it owns in about 40 oil and gas fields alongside Royal Dutch Shell. The portfolio could fetch the US oil major about $2bn, according to market sources, after a string of similar deals in the North Sea in recent months. ExxonMobil is responsible for producing about 5% of the UK\u2019s oil and gas through the joint venture which it formed with the Anglo-Dutch firm in the early days of North Sea oil exploration in the 1960s. The joint portfolio \u2013 which is entirely operated by Shell \u2013 includes the prolific Brent field which first began pumping oil in the North Sea\u2019s 1970s heyday, and lent its name to the global benchmark price for crude oil. A spokesman for ExxonMobil declined to comment on the sale talks. The North Sea exit would make Exxon the third major US oil company to turn its back on the UK oil basin after Chevron and ConocoPhillips beat a retreat in multibillion-dollar deals earlier this summer. The US companies are understood to be backing out of the North Sea in favour of North American shale projects which produce a much quicker return on investment. The North Sea fields have been snapped up by smaller North Sea minnows with deep-pocketed owners in a flurry of deals this year. The Aberdeen-based Chrysaor agreed in April to pay $2.67bn for ConocoPhillips\u2019s North Sea fields, in its biggest deal since snapping up Shell\u2019s North Sea assets for $3.8bn in 2017. A month later Chevron agreed to sell its North Sea portfolio to Israeli-owned Ithaca Energy for $2bn. Ithaca Energy, which is backed by the Israeli energy giant Delek Group, is understood to be in talks with ExxonMobil over the latest deal too. Ithaca is likely to face competition from the Omani oil company Petrogas, which is on the hunt for North Sea opportunities after striking a deal last month to pay more than $500m for a package of North Sea fields form the French oil major Total. The Chevron and Conoco deals attracted the attention of Sir Jim Ratcliffe\u2019s chemical business Ineos before the pair struck deals with the smaller suitors, according to industry sources. As a result the billionaire industrialist could be one of the parties interested in buying Exxon\u2019s assets to secure a steady supply of hydrocarbons for its Grangemouth refinery in Scotland. Ineos is also understood to be eyeing the chance to buy a string of gas fields from Perenco, the Anglo-French oil and gas firm owned by the widow of the French billionaire Hubert Perrodo. In recent years Ineos has extended its interests in the North Sea while oil majors have eyed the exits. It snapped up the Forties pipeline system which carries about 40% of the UK\u2019s oil and gas from the North Sea to mainland processing plants. Ineos has also bought a string of oil and gas fields to supply hydrocarbons to the Grangemouth plant, and had hoped to frack for shale gas to top up its supplies.

But perhaps a caveat to that should be \u201cunless they choose to blast music at your walls all day and night\u201d. One man from Blackwater, in Cornwall, has angered the neighbours in his housing block after asking his Alexa speaker to play Bon Jovi repeatedly at all hours. From Maurice the cockerel, the French bird whose piercing dawn calls have led neighbours to take legal action, to the \u201cdrum\u2019n\u2019bass pensioner\u201d who had more than 300 CDs confiscated from his flat in 2017, and the teenager who was playing Adele at an \u201cintrusive, very high level\u201d, noisy neighbours seem to always be around the corner. One Guardian reader, from Peckham in south-east London who wished to remain anonymous, lived next to a woman who insisted on playing Carpenters Gold each night. \u201cThere was an old fireplace between my bedroom and her place, not a solid wall, so it could be very loud,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then the downstairs flat would also get annoyed because they couldn\u2019t hear their music, so they\u2019d turn theirs up and this would go on and on.\u201d Eventually, his neighbour moved out, but he has never been able to listen to the band since. Another reader, Ann, from Southport, Merseyside, was staying in a holiday villa when she heard a \u201crepetitive thudding noise coming from the flat above. We were quite impressed by this apparent epic performance until we later discovered that the occupants were expecting visitors and were pumping up an airbed (or so they said).\u201d Michael, from Melbourne, Australia, had a neighbour who was in the habit of \u201cplaying techno versions of Enya and other associated artists\u201d every Sunday morning. To add to the impromptu rave, at the same time his neighbour \u201cwould be spewing, or on the verge of spewing, with loud vomiting noises regularly waking the household\u201d. Rather than reporting him to local authorities, \u201cwe didn\u2019t speak to him about it as we found it funny and didn\u2019t want him to stop\u201d. Additional reporting by Rachel Obordo",

The \u201cBasic Law\u201d constitution guarantees to protect, for the next 50 years, the democratic institutions that make&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;distinct from Communist-ruled mainland China.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2003:&nbsp;</b>Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s leaders introduce legislation that would forbid acts of treason and subversion against the Chinese government. The bill resembles laws used to charge dissidents on the mainland. An estimated half a million people turn out to protest against the bill. As a result of the backlash, further action on the proposal is halted.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2007:&nbsp;</b>The Basic Law stated that the ultimate aim was for&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s voters to achieve a complete democracy, but China decides in 2007 that universal suffrage in elections for the chief executive cannot be implemented until 2017. Some lawmakers are chosen by business and trade groups, while others are elected by vote. In a bid to accelerate a decision on universal suffrage, five lawmakers resign. But this act is followed by the adoption of the Beijing-backed electoral changes, which expand the chief executive\u2019s selection committee and add more seats for lawmakers elected by direct vote. The legislation divides Hong&nbsp;Kong's pro-democracy camp, as some support the reforms while others say they will only delay full democracy while reinforcing a structure that favors Beijing.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2014:&nbsp;</b>The Chinese government introduces a bill allowing Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;residents to vote for their leader in 2017, but with one major caveat: the candidates must be approved by Beijing. Pro-democracy lawmakers are incensed by the bill, which they call an example of \u201cfake universal suffrage\u201d and \u201cfake democracy\u201d. The move triggers a massive protest as crowds occupy some of&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s most crowded districts for 70 days. In June 2015,&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;legislators formally reject the bill, and electoral reform stalls. The current chief executive, Carrie Lam, widely seen as the Chinese Communist party\u2019s favoured candidate, is hand-picked in 2017 by a 1,200-person committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2019:&nbsp;</b>Lam pushes amendments to extradition laws that would allow people to be sent to mainland China to face charges. The proposed legislation triggers a huge protest, with organisers putting the turnout at 1 million, and a standoff that forces the legislature to postpone debate on the bills. After weeks of protest, often meeting with violent reprisals from the Hong Kong police, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/04/hong-kong-lam-to-withdraw-extradition-bill-say-reports\">Lam announced that she would withdraw the bill</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with a promise it would retain a high degree of autonomy, an independent judiciary and freedoms not allowed on the mainland.</p> \n<p>Demonstrators say they are fighting against the erosion of that \u201cone country, two systems\u201d arrangement.</p> \n<p>Chris Patten, Hong Kong\u2019s last British governor, warned on Tuesday that Chinese intervention would be disastrous.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat would be a catastrophe for China and of course for Hong Kong,\u201d Patten told the BBC. \u201cSince President Xi has been in office, there\u2019s been a crackdown on dissent and dissidents everywhere.

After the police retreated, protesters barricaded themselves into the terminal, leaving the two sides in an uneasy standoff. It was the fifth consecutive day that thousands of people had flocked to demonstrate at the city\u2019s airport.

It was not immediately clear what the scope of the injunction to remove the protesters would be or how it would be enforced, but technically it would become effective once it was posted in a public area at the airport. The pro-democracy protest movement, originally launched in response to a controversial extradition law, is now in its 10th week and there have been increasingly violent clashes between police and protesters. The airport protest came as the United Nations high commissioner for human rights urged Hong Kong\u2019s authorities to exercise restraint and investigate evidence of its forces firing teargas at protesters in ways banned under international law. Airport check-in operations were suspended at 4.30pm as protesters gathered in the arrivals hall, as well as some departure areas, using luggage trolleys to blockade the doors to customs checkpoints. Floors and walls were covered with notes penned by activists and other artwork. The scene was peaceful as protesters spoke to travellers, explaining their motives. Rights groups and democracy activists have accused police of using increasingly excessive force. At least 40 people were treated in hospital after clashes on Sunday, including a woman who was reportedly hit with a beanbag round fired from a police shotgun and could lose an eye. Medical staff at more than a dozen public hospitals staged a sit-in on Tuesday against police tactics and the government\u2019s refusal to accede to protesters\u2019 demands. The Civil Human Rights Front, a group which has organised several of the mass marches over the past two months, called for a new rally on Sunday. The unprecedented cancellation of all flights on Monday coincided with the latest in an increasingly threatening series of statements by Beijing. A Chinese official said \u201cterrorism\u201d was emerging in the city, while in Hong Kong authorities demonstrated water cannon for use in crowd control. Late on Monday, two Chinese state media outlets ran videos showing armoured personnel carriers purportedly driving to Shenzhen, which borders Hong Kong. On Tuesday, the territory\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam, said violence was pushing Hong Kong \u201cdown a path of no return\u201d. . Lam, who at one point appeared to be near tears, appealed for calm but again refused any concessions to protesters. \u201cTake a minute to think, look at our city, our home, do you all really want to see it pushed into an abyss?\u201d she asked. Clad in black and wearing face masks, their unofficial uniform, protesters at the airport on Tuesday chanted: \u201cStand with Hong Kong, fight for freedom,\u201d as passengers scrambling to catch rescheduled and delayed flights from Monday. One protester, Vanessa Lee, said: \u201cOf course we apologised to people who are affected by our actions but we hope they understand what we are fighting for. We spared some [space] for them to do their check-in process and we are trying to leave them.\u201d The protests began as opposition to a now-suspended bill that would have allowed criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China, but have swelled into wider calls for democracy. They have plunged the Chinese territory into its most serious crisis since the handover from British colonial rule, and presented President Xi Jinping with one of his biggest challenges since he came to power in 2012. Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with a promise it would retain a high degree of autonomy, an independent judiciary and freedoms not allowed on the mainland. Demonstrators say they are fighting against the erosion of that \u201cone country, two systems\u201d arrangement. Chris Patten, Hong Kong\u2019s last British governor, warned on Tuesday that Chinese intervention would be disastrous. \u201cThat would be a catastrophe for China and of course for Hong Kong,\u201d Patten told the BBC. \u201cSince President Xi has been in office, there\u2019s been a crackdown on dissent and dissidents everywhere. The party has been in control of everything.\u201d Reuters and Agence France-Presse contributed to this article",

The comedian was clocked driving his Porsche at 36mph in a 30mph zone close to his mansion in East Sussex, earning him a three-point endorsement on his driving licence. Because he already had nine points from previous offences he faced an automatic six-month ban. Magistrates in Crawley instead decided to ban him from driving for two months after hearing that a lengthier time off the road would force him to cancel an Alan Partridge travelogue series he is set to make for the BBC. Coogan told the court that in the series, which he is due to film in October, Partridge drives to various locations around Britain meeting people: \u201cI\u2019m producing a travelogue follow-on TV series where I\u2019m basically driving around Britain.

It\u2019s part of his character that he drives,\u201d he said. Coogan told the court that the camera shots could not be faked: \u201cYou have cameras mounted on the bonnet then you have other shots where you have a camera mounted on a separate car filming the person in the car driving.\u201d He said his Baby Cow production company has lined up between 15 and 20 staff to work on the series and they would struggle to find alternative work if he cancelled at short notice. The court heard the actor had a history of speeding offences and had attended a drivers awareness course just two months ago. Coogan admitted his driving record was not good, but said he had now taken steps to change his behaviour: \u201cI\u2019m trying to slow down and I try to observe the average speed limits that have come in. I tend to drive the one, the car, with the automatic cruise control that will keep me within the speed.\u201d Ann Schroder, the chair of the magistrates bench, said they had taken into account the \u201cexceptional hardship\u201d it would cause other TV professionals if the series had to be cancelled.

      "bodyText": "The Hinkley Point nuclear site, on the Somerset coast, should have begun powering around 6m homes well over a year ago. Instead, the 160-hectare (400-acre) sprawl is still the UK\u2019s largest construction site more than a decade after the plan for Britain\u2019s nuclear renaissance first emerged. It will be at least another six years before Hinkley Point C, the first nuclear plant to be built in the UK since 1995, begins generating 7% of the nation\u2019s electricity. The price tag is expected to exceed \u00a320bn, almost double that suggested in 2008 by EDF Energy, which is spearheading the project alongside a Chinese project partner. At the time, EDF Energy\u2019s chief executive, Vincent de Rivaz, said the mega-project would power millions of homes by late 2017. He pegged the cost at \u00a345 for every megawatt-hour. De Rivaz retired a decade later, but the promised switch-on moment remains distant. Delays have been blamed on protracted Whitehall wrangling over the project\u2019s eye-watering costs: the price per megawatt-hour has since more than doubled. Still, this summer workers carried out the UK\u2019s largest concrete pour to complete the base of the first reactor. Simone Rossi, EDF Energy\u2019s incumbent chief, said the milestone was \u201cgood news for anyone concerned about the climate change crisis\u201d. \u201cIts reliable, low-carbon power will be essential for a future with no unabated coal and gas and a large expansion of renewable power,\u201d he said. The cost concerns have proved more difficult for executives and ministers to address. The National Audit Office condemned the government\u2019s deal to support the Hinkley Point project through consumer energy bills in a damning report, which accused ministers of putting households on the hook for a \u201crisky and expensive\u201d project with \u201cuncertain strategic and economic benefits\u201d. Hinkley Point will add between \u00a310 and \u00a315 a year to the average energy bill for 35 years, making it one of the most expensive energy projects undertaken. Under EDF Energy\u2019s contract with the government, the French state-backed energy giant will earn at least \u00a392.50 for every megawatt-hour produced at Hinkley Point for 35 years by charging households an extra levy on top of the market price for power. The average electricity price on the UK\u2019s wholesale electricity market was between \u00a355 and \u00a365 per megawatt-hour last year. The dramatic collapse in the cost of wind, solar and battery technologies has made nuclear power even harder to swallow. Despite its detractors, Hinkley Point has soldiered on because concerns over the project\u2019s costs, although considerable, are still smaller than the concerns over the UK\u2019s future energy supplies. The project was first mooted under Tony Blair\u2019s Labour government as an answer to the UK\u2019s looming energy supply gap after years of underinvestment in the UK\u2019s fleet of power plants. The nuclear mantle was taken up in the coalition years by the Liberal Democrat energy secretary Ed Davey, before it was given the green light by the Conservative government. Andrew Stephenson, the minister in charge of nuclear, said Hinkley was \u201ckey to meeting our ambitious target of net zero emissions by 2050\u201d. Nuclear power is controversial among environmentalists, many of whom do not consider the uranium-fuelled energy to be a sustainable option. But according to the government\u2019s official climate advisers new nuclear reactors are needed. The Committee on Climate Change expects renewable energy to play a major role filling the gap in energy supplies. Offshore wind will increase tenfold to help meet its 2050 target to reduce emissions to net zero, and the climate watchdog has called for onshore wind and solar to play a far larger role too. But the advisers predict that at least two new nuclear reactors, in addition to Hinkley Point, will be required to help the UK meet its climate goals. The verdict means households are likely to be called on to stump up for EDF Energy\u2019s follow-on project at the Sizewell site in Suffolk. It also leaves the door open for a resurrection of plans to build reactors in north Wales, and possibly a Chinese-led nuclear project in Bradwell in Essex too. Hinkley in numbers \u2022 9,000 cubic metres \u2013 the largest pour of concrete ever in the UK took place at the Hinkley Point site to complete the base of the first reactor.

He spent 18 months in the Priory recuperating and has several of his own workforce going through similar excruciation. \u201cThere\u2019s no wriggle room and you can\u2019t expect people operating like this to take all the burden. Is there a consideration to the wellbeing of people delivering that? There needs to be something to prevent our industry from hurting itself.\u201d Measures are being taken. Hill says EDF, which is running the Hinkley Point project revealed to have a pressing mental health problem, is doing a lot to try to improve the situation. \u201cThe industry is trying to change the culture, trying to ensure that no worker should be alone in a crisis,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are trying to give all these people who are self-employed information and advice and guidance, a 24-hour helpline, getting mental health first aiders on site, giving people extra training and listening skills.\u201d Andy Stevens is another boss of a small building business who has considered ending it all. Of 10 people in his company, he says two are going through a tough time. \u201cIt\u2019s the pressure, the insecurity,\u201d he says. \u201cThey say the stigma is easing up and more people are talking about it. But if you have a 6ft 4in, 16-stone, tattooed scaffolder suffering, he\u2019s not going to come in and say: \u2018I\u2019m struggling.\u2019\u201d A review into the 2018 collapse of the construction services company Carillion noted: \u201cThe government\u2019s drive for cost savings can itself come at a price.\u201d That price is not just financial. \u2022 In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

Government officials quickly claimed there was no evacuation, while giving little additional information about why locals were being asked to leave the area. \u201cThis is absurd, there is no evacuation,\u201d Igor Orlov, the regional governor, told the Interfax news agency on Tuesday. At least five people were killed earlier this week when a rocket exploded during the highly secretive test, causing a spike in gamma radiation levels in the city of Severodvinsk nearly 20 miles away for several hours. Experts have speculated that Russia\u2019s military could have been testing an experimental nuclear-powered cruise missile first unveiled by Vladimir Putin in 2018. The missile would theoretically have unlimited range and be able to evade US missile defence systems, but experts are doubtful whether its core technology, a small nuclear reactor inside a missile, is viable. \u201cThe United States is learning much from the failed missile explosion in Russia,\u201d Donald Trump tweeted on Monday. \u201cWe have similar, though more advanced, technology. The Russian \u2018Skyfall\u2019 explosion has people worried about the air around the facility, and far beyond. Not good!\u201d Russia has maintained a veil of secrecy around the accident. The military initially mentioned only a rocket explosion and said radiation levels were stable. It was later contradicted by monitoring data and statements by Rosatom, the Russian state atomic energy agency, which confirmed the explosion occurred while testing an \u201cisotope power source in a liquid propulsion system\u201d. Russia has closed a portion of a bay in the White Sea near where the incident took place on a floating platform, and the Serebryanak, a ship believed to be used to retrieve radioactive materials following military tests, has been spotted in the exclusion zone. It is possible that Wednesday\u2019s short-term evacuation could be tied to the retrieval of materials used in last week\u2019s test. On Tuesday, Russia\u2019s environmental monitoring agency released data showing that gamma radiation in Severodvinsk had risen up to 16 times the expected levels for a period of two hours following the explosion. Local residents have been given little information about the incident. Pharmacies in several northern cities said that residents had stocked up on iodine, a chemical that reduces the effects of radiation exposure. Message boards on the Vkontakte social network serving Severodvinsk and other cities saw posts from locals concerned about tests involving nuclear materials. \u201cWe have to make it so that these kinds of tests can\u2019t take place so close to the city,\u201d wrote one woman in a forum for residents of Severodvinsk. The Tass news agency also reported on Tuesday that medics who treated victims of last week\u2019s accident had been sent to Moscow for medical examinations. They had been pictured wearing protective suits and respirators after the accident. Tass also reported that they had signed non-disclosure agreements about the accident.",

      "body": "<p>If you think <em>fencing</em>, you may think of a sport practiced by the upper classes everywhere from elite universities to the denouement of Hamlet. Or you may picture Inigo Montoya in The Princess Bride, a film that put Mandy Patinkin and Cary Elwes through <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/10/princess-bride-30th-anniversary-sword-fight-inigo-montoya-man-in-black-rob-reiner-mandy-patinkin-cary-elwes\">rigorous training</a> to play the chivalrous duelists who became allies after a breathtaking scene that name-dropped <a href=\"http://princessbrideforever.com/fencing-language-princess-bride-2/\">actual fencing masters</a> Bonetti, Capo Ferro, Thibault and Agrippa.</p> \n<p>But, in the United States at least, fencing isn\u2019t just a pastime for the ossified, insular gentry. The American fencing community is relatively diverse and worldly. So it\u2019s no surprise that someone from this cosmopolitan community, Race Imboden, has taken athlete protests to the next level <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/10/race-imboden-kneels-national-anthem-pan-am-games\">by kneeling on the podium</a> after winning gold at the Pan-Am Games.</p> \n<p>Imboden <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Race_Imboden/status/1159988047921975296\">listed several reasons</a> for his actions, including racism in the States and \u201ca president who spreads hate\u201d. He also mentioned gun control, a timely comment after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/09/el-paso-shooting-victims\">the mass shootings</a> in El Paso and Dayton, and the equally timely issue of the US government\u2019s treatment of immigrants.</p> \n<p>The 26-year-old Imboden, a two-time Olympian and bronze medalist in the 2016 team event, isn\u2019t the first athlete to kneel during the national anthem, a means of protest popularized by former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick. He\u2019s not even the first to kneel while wearing a US uniform, as Megan Rapinoe <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/sports/2016/09/19/us-soccer-star-megan-rapinoe-kneels-during-anthem-for-second-straight-game.html\">did at women\u2019s soccer friendlies</a> in 2016. And Imboden himself took a knee, along with teammate Miles Chamley-Watson, at a World Cup event in 2017.</p> \n<p>But kneeling at the Pan-Am Games has raised the stakes. It\u2019s not the biggest event on US television in August, but it\u2019s still an important event for America\u2019s Olympians. Imboden had company as well \u2013 American hammer thrower Gwen Berry <a href=\"https://www.theroot.com/u-s-hammer-thrower-gwen-berry-raises-fist-during-nation-1837171427\">raised a fist on the podium</a> in a move reminiscent of John Carlos and Tommie Smith\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/oct/17/smith-and-carlos-embodied-many-african-americans-summer-of-love-and-reckoning\">iconic moment at the 1968 Olympics</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/10/race-imboden-kneels-national-anthem-pan-am-games\">US Olympic medalist faces discipline for taking knee after winning Pan-Am gold</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Imboden has support from his fellow fencers too. \u201cI\u2019m glad to see any athlete with a platform stand up for equality and against the rising hate in America, whether they are a soccer player, fencer or football player,\u201d says Becca Ward, who won two saber bronzes in the 2008 Olympics. \u201cWe all have a part to play saying this isn\u2019t acceptable and demanding more from our country and fellow citizens.\u201d</p> \n<p>The fencing community has long drawn from elite universities with progressive-minded students. Columbia University, which won <a href=\"https://gocolumbialions.com/news/2019/3/24/fencing-crowned-national-champions-earned-two-individual-titles.aspx\">its 16th national championship</a> in March, has been rated among the <a href=\"https://www.niche.com/colleges/search/most-liberal-colleges/?page=2\">most liberal colleges</a> in the country. Other schools in fencing\u2019s top 12 included Harvard, Yale, Duke, Princeton, Penn, Northwestern and Stanford, none of which would be likely to have a majority of students voting for Donald Trump.</p> \n<p>Imboden is one of the exceptions who did not pass through college fencing at an elite or large state university, but there\u2019s a catch. He was set to fence at St John\u2019s but decided against it rather than give up income from <a href=\"https://www.theplayerstribune.com/en-us/articles/race-imboden-ncaa-fencing\">his modeling career</a>.</p> \n<p>The US fencing community has benefited from racial diversity, starting with the breakthrough of <a href=\"https://www.usafencing.org/news_article/show/999368\">Peter Westbrook</a>, the son of an African American father and Japanese mother living in housing projects, who won bronze in men\u2019s saber at the 1984 Olympics.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jul/27/ibtihaj-muhammad-fencing-hijab-olympics\">Ibtihaj Muhammad: 'Being made to feel different is what makes it all the more difficult'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Westbrook has since <a href=\"http://www.peterwestbrook.org/\">started a foundation</a>, based in the fencing hotbed of New York, which has produced plenty of collegians and Olympians. One of those fencers, Ibtihaj Muhammad, is the first American to participate in the Olympics while wearing a hijab despite reporting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jul/27/ibtihaj-muhammad-fencing-hijab-olympics\">some institutional resistance</a> along the way.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe Peter Westbrook Foundation does great work bringing fencing and the benefits of athletics to underserved communities, and athletes like Ibtihaj Muhammad, and many PWF athletes before her, are changing people\u2019s conception of what fencers look like and who the sport includes,\u201d says Ward, who competed at Duke a few years after Muhammad.</p> \n<p>The diversity effort helped to invigorate USA Fencing and propel the country from also-ran status to perennial medal contender. Westbrook\u2019s bronze in 1984 was the only medal US fencers earned between 1960, when Albie Axelrod won bronze, and 2004, when Mariel Zagunis won gold and Sada Jacobson won bronze in women\u2019s saber. In 2008, Zagunis, Jacobson and Ward swept the women\u2019s saber individual medals and took team bronze.</p> \n<p>Also in 2008, the US men\u2019s saber team broke through on the strength of a couple of Westbrook-educated fencers \u2013 Keeth Smart and Tim Morehouse. Smart\u2019s sister, Erinn, took silver in team foil to round out the USA\u2019s total of six medals in Beijing. Two more Westbrook fencers, both African American, medaled in 2016 \u2013 Muhammad in the team saber and Daryl Homer in the individual saber.</p> \n<p>Morehouse went on to start <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/14/sports/an-olympian-take-fencing-to-children-in-cities.html\">his own outreach program</a>, Fencing in the Schools. And Smart, who got the US team to the 2008 final with <a href=\"https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/2008/FEN/mens-sabre-team.html\">two last-ditch rallies</a>, was impressed with Imboden\u2019s gesture. \u201cRace is a friend and very intelligent person who also happens to be an incredible athlete,\u201d Smart says. \u201cI am not surprised by his action as he is very thoughtful and caring based on his experiences growing up in Brooklyn.\u201d</p> \n<p>But Ward warns that the sport still has institutional barriers. \u201cDiversity does not necessarily equal inclusion, and with an extremely high-cost and subjective sport controlled by a small set of coaches, there is much more work to be done to ensure new athletes are welcomed and supported,\u201d Ward says.<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "If you think fencing, you may think of a sport practiced by the upper classes everywhere from elite universities to the denouement of Hamlet. Or you may picture Inigo Montoya in The Princess Bride, a film that put Mandy Patinkin and Cary Elwes through rigorous training to play the chivalrous duelists who became allies after a breathtaking scene that name-dropped actual fencing masters Bonetti, Capo Ferro, Thibault and Agrippa. But, in the United States at least, fencing isn\u2019t just a pastime for the ossified, insular gentry. The American fencing community is relatively diverse and worldly. So it\u2019s no surprise that someone from this cosmopolitan community, Race Imboden, has taken athlete protests to the next level by kneeling on the podium after winning gold at the Pan-Am Games. Imboden listed several reasons for his actions, including racism in the States and \u201ca president who spreads hate\u201d. He also mentioned gun control, a timely comment after the mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, and the equally timely issue of the US government\u2019s treatment of immigrants. The 26-year-old Imboden, a two-time Olympian and bronze medalist in the 2016 team event, isn\u2019t the first athlete to kneel during the national anthem, a means of protest popularized by former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick. He\u2019s not even the first to kneel while wearing a US uniform, as Megan Rapinoe did at women\u2019s soccer friendlies in 2016. And Imboden himself took a knee, along with teammate Miles Chamley-Watson, at a World Cup event in 2017. But kneeling at the Pan-Am Games has raised the stakes. It\u2019s not the biggest event on US television in August, but it\u2019s still an important event for America\u2019s Olympians. Imboden had company as well \u2013 American hammer thrower Gwen Berry raised a fist on the podium in a move reminiscent of John Carlos and Tommie Smith\u2019s iconic moment at the 1968 Olympics. Imboden has support from his fellow fencers too. \u201cI\u2019m glad to see any athlete with a platform stand up for equality and against the rising hate in America, whether they are a soccer player, fencer or football player,\u201d says Becca Ward, who won two saber bronzes in the 2008 Olympics. \u201cWe all have a part to play saying this isn\u2019t acceptable and demanding more from our country and fellow citizens.\u201d The fencing community has long drawn from elite universities with progressive-minded students. Columbia University, which won its 16th national championship in March, has been rated among the most liberal colleges in the country. Other schools in fencing\u2019s top 12 included Harvard, Yale, Duke, Princeton, Penn, Northwestern and Stanford, none of which would be likely to have a majority of students voting for Donald Trump. Imboden is one of the exceptions who did not pass through college fencing at an elite or large state university, but there\u2019s a catch. He was set to fence at St John\u2019s but decided against it rather than give up income from his modeling career. The US fencing community has benefited from racial diversity, starting with the breakthrough of Peter Westbrook, the son of an African American father and Japanese mother living in housing projects, who won bronze in men\u2019s saber at the 1984 Olympics. Westbrook has since started a foundation, based in the fencing hotbed of New York, which has produced plenty of collegians and Olympians. One of those fencers, Ibtihaj Muhammad, is the first American to participate in the Olympics while wearing a hijab despite reporting some institutional resistance along the way. \u201cThe Peter Westbrook Foundation does great work bringing fencing and the benefits of athletics to underserved communities, and athletes like Ibtihaj Muhammad, and many PWF athletes before her, are changing people\u2019s conception of what fencers look like and who the sport includes,\u201d says Ward, who competed at Duke a few years after Muhammad. The diversity effort helped to invigorate USA Fencing and propel the country from also-ran status to perennial medal contender. Westbrook\u2019s bronze in 1984 was the only medal US fencers earned between 1960, when Albie Axelrod won bronze, and 2004, when Mariel Zagunis won gold and Sada Jacobson won bronze in women\u2019s saber. In 2008, Zagunis, Jacobson and Ward swept the women\u2019s saber individual medals and took team bronze. Also in 2008, the US men\u2019s saber team broke through on the strength of a couple of Westbrook-educated fencers \u2013 Keeth Smart and Tim Morehouse. Smart\u2019s sister, Erinn, took silver in team foil to round out the USA\u2019s total of six medals in Beijing. Two more Westbrook fencers, both African American, medaled in 2016 \u2013 Muhammad in the team saber and Daryl Homer in the individual saber. Morehouse went on to start his own outreach program, Fencing in the Schools. And Smart, who got the US team to the 2008 final with two last-ditch rallies, was impressed with Imboden\u2019s gesture. \u201cRace is a friend and very intelligent person who also happens to be an incredible athlete,\u201d Smart says. \u201cI am not surprised by his action as he is very thoughtful and caring based on his experiences growing up in Brooklyn.\u201d But Ward warns that the sport still has institutional barriers. \u201cDiversity does not necessarily equal inclusion, and with an extremely high-cost and subjective sport controlled by a small set of coaches, there is much more work to be done to ensure new athletes are welcomed and supported,\u201d Ward says.",

It seems that Mr Trump blinked first, and the bulls are taking full advantage of the news.

      "bodyText": "Finally, the latest twist in the US-China trade war had pushed London\u2019s stock market higher. The FTSE 100 index has just closed, up 24 points at 7,250. A more modest move than in New York, but better than earlier in the day (when the Footsie was down 50 points). David Madden of CMC Markets explains: Last month, President Trump announced that tariffs will be imposed on $300 billion worth of Chinese imports come September, and now some of those tariffs will be delayed until December. In addition, the negotiations between the two sides will take place next month, and that has added to the bullish move. It seems that Mr Trump blinked first, and the bulls are taking full advantage of the news. With worries about a recession brewing in Germany, political uncertainty in Italy and violent scenes in Hong Kong, the easing up of hostilities between the US and China has been a welcome change to the doom and gloom of the past few days. On that positive note, goodnight! A late newsflash: America\u2019s trade office has just announced it will delay tariffs on some Chinese imports until December. The Trade Representative\u2019s office says the planned 10% tariffs on some consumer goods including toys and mobile phones will not now kick in until mid-December. This could spare Americans from price hikes in the run-up to Christmas, and perhaps signal that president Trump is having second thoughts about his tough stance on trade - which helped drive markets down in recent weeks. Wall Street is certainly excited - the Dow has jumped by 436 points to 26,333, up 1.7% today. Time for a recap: British workers have seen the fastest jump in basic pay since the financial crisis. Earnings rose by 3.9% per year in the April-June quarter, the fastest since 2008. But once you adjust for inflation, earnings are still below their pre-crisis levels. And with unemployment also up, vacancies down, some economists fear the UK jobs market may have peaked. Worries over Germany\u2019s economy have intensified, after investor confidence hit its lowest level since 2011. Trade conflict, Brexit, and the slowdown in the global economy are all being blamed. It could suggest that Germany\u2019s economy is shrinking -- we\u2019ll find out tomorrow, when GDP data for the second quarter of 2019 is released. US inflation has risen, as Americans face higher prices for gasoline and rent. But despite the core CPI hitting 2.2%, some economists believe the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again in September. Stock markets have fallen across the globe, as investors continue to fret about trade wars, and the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. The prospect of a debt crisis in Argentina is also alarming the markets, driving down the price of its 100-year bond to record lows. The peso is also sliding, adding to Monday\u2019s slump. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is down 30 points, close to last week\u2019s two-month low. Gold is benefiting from the sell-off, with prices hitting a six-year high over $1,525 per ounce today. Ding Ding! Wall Street has opened, with small losses on the main indices. The Dow Jones industrial average has dipped by 33 points, or 0.13%, as traders remain cautious after Monday\u2019s selloff. The Nasdaq and the S&amp;P 500 are both down around 0.1%. Bank shares are among the fallers, extending August\u2019s losses: Uh-oh.... Argentina\u2019s currency is weakening in early trading, having slumped by a third yesterday. The markets are clearly still concerned that president Macri will be ousted in October, after losing heavily in last weekend\u2019s presidential primary election. Andrew Hunter of Capital Economics predicts that the rise in US inflation won\u2019t prevent another cut in US interest rates, in September. The stronger than expected 0.3% m/m rise in core consumer prices in July, which followed a similar gain in June, suggests that underlying inflationary pressures may not be as subdued as is widely assumed. Provided that the incoming activity data continue to deteriorate, however, the Fed still looks likely to cut interest rates again next month. President Trump has just repeated his claim that there\u2019s \u201cno inflation\u201d in the US, just minutes after official figures showed prices rose last month. Trump\u2019s claim that tariffs are a \u201cgift from China\u201d is baffling, though, as the levy is actually paid by the US importers (or passed onto customers though higher prices). Economics professor Julia Coronado says the tariffs imposed by president Trump on Chinese imports helped to push inflation up. Here\u2019s some snap reaction to the rise in US inflation last month: Just in: American consumer prices rose last month, despite Donald Trump\u2019s claim that the US doesn\u2019t have an inflation problem. Gas prices and rental costs drove the cost of living up by 0.3% in July, new government figure show. This pushed the annual US consumer prices index up to 1.8%, from 1.6% in June. Core inflation, which strips out volatile factors, jumped from 2.1% to 2.2% - a six-month high. This isn\u2019t a reason to panic -- inflation is pretty close to the official target of 2%. But it might make it a little harder for the Federal Reserve to justify another interest rate cut, following July\u2019s reduction in borrowing costs. The bond market continues to emit worrying noises. The gap between the interest rate on two-year US bonds, and the longer-dated 10-year Treasuries, has narrowed again. The two rates are almost identical (at 1.6% and 1.605% respectively), meaning there\u2019s hardly any benefit in holding the longer-dated (and thus riskier) bonds. That\u2019s classically a sign of an impending recession (in which shorter-term bonds become riskier to hold). The slump in German investor sentiment has helped to push European stock markets into the red today. The main indices are all lower, led by Germany\u2019s DAX index which is 1% lower. Geopolitical fears, including the ongoing protests in Hong Kong and the surprise success of the left-wing in Argentina\u2019s presidential primary, are also weighing on stocks. Here\u2019s some reaction to the slump in German investor confidence this month. ZEW chief Achim Wambach says the German economic outlook \u201csignificantly worsened\u201d this month: \u201cRenewed escalation in the trade dispute between the US and China, the linked risk of a global race to depreciate currencies and the higher risk of a no-deal Brexit have mingled with economic growth that was already weaker.\u201d Naeem Aslam of Think Markets is alarmed by the tumble in Zew\u2019s investor confidence index, to MINUS 44.1. Te German ZEW data was completely rotten, it confirmed that the economic engine of the eurozone has some serious trouble. This further strengthens the argument that it is time to park your assets in safe haven and this is reason that we are seeing the bond yields making all time lows and gold well above the $1,500/ounce mark and on its way to touch the 1550 target. Nadia Gharbi of Pictet Asset Management blames Brexit fears, and the trade war between Washington and Beijing: John Hardy of Saxo Bank points out that Germany\u2019s factories have been struggling for months: The broader economy has been held up by a modest consumption and housing boom as years of negative rates finally swung the German real estate sector into gear. The Germany export engine and manufacturing sector are in dire recession, meanwhile. The latest survey of German investors has fuelled concerns that Europe\u2019s largest economy could soon fall into recession. The ZEW Institute\u2019s survey of investor morale has slumped to an eight-year low, cratering from -24.5 to -44.1. That\u2019s even weaker than during much of the eurozone crisis, suggesting serious pessimism over Germany\u2019s prospects. In recent months it has suffered sharp falls in exports and factory orders, as the US-China trade war has hit demand. Here\u2019s some reaction: Here\u2019s our news story on the UK jobs data: It\u2019s misleading to argue the strong rise in wages in the period April to June shows the jobs market \u201cshines\u201d (Reuters) or that the jobs market is \u201ctight\u201d (Financial Times), says my colleague Phillip Inman: The private sector has cut vacancies and increased redundancies, pushing more workers on to zero hour contracts, indicating that employers are increasingly nervous about the future. Employers also haven\u2019t increased pay by much for the bulk of workers. The rise comes for those on the bottom pay scales and only then because the government increased the national Minimum wage this year for more than 2 million workers by 4.9%. Pay rises for public sector workers in the spring, which were largely absent in previous years, also stand out as a fresh impetus for the rise in average regular wages As John Philpott, the director of the Jobs Economist consultancy argues: \u2018The pick-up in pay growth should not therefore be interpreted as a sign that the labour market is tightening, which might signal mounting inflationary pressure. On the contrary, the jobs, vacancies and redundancies data suggest that demand for labour in cooling, albeit only slightly. Back in the markets... Hong Kong\u2019s stocks shed another 2% today, after pro-democracy demonstrators staged another rally at its airport, forcing flights to be suspended again. The selloff reflects concerns that Hong Kong\u2019s economy will suffer from the disruption, potentially dropping into recession. It also reflects fears that Chinese authorities could use military force to crush the protests (armoured personnel carriers and tanks have been sighted close to the border with Hong Kong). Mike Bird of the Wall Street Journal has written about the situation - here\u2019s a flavour: Property is a linchpin of the local economy, and demand could be hurt if investors are spooked by the protests. The city\u2019s economy is lurching toward its first recession since the financial crisis, and retail and tourism are suffering. To make things worse, the heightened tensions mean companies risk either offending China, which could seriously affect their ability to operate, or Hong Kong staff and customers\u2014which could damage sales and morale. The clearest example has been Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. The flag carrier\u2019s shares have tumbled more than 7% in just two trading days, hitting a 10-year low. Laura Gardiner, research director at the Resolution Foundation, is also concerned by the rise in zero-hours contracts. Here\u2019s her take: \u201cThe UK labour market looks like a sea of calm amid growing economic uncertainty both here and abroad. Employment remains at a record high, while earnings are growing at their fastest rate since mid-2008. \u201cThe question is how long this calm can be sustained, with the economy contracting and productivity falling for the fourth consecutive quarter. Turning this around has to be a top priority for the new government. \u201cAnd while the labour market overall is in rude health, the significant rise in Zero-Hours Contracts shows that job quality remains a concern, particularly for young people.\u201d Resolution have also tweeted some key points from today\u2019s jobs report: The UK may be creating more jobs, but it\u2019s not becoming any more productive. Labour productivity shrank by 0.6% in April-June, which is the fourth consecutive quarterly contraction. That means that the number of hours worked rose faster than the amount of extra output produced. The ONS has also spotted that the number of UK workers on zero-hours contracts has jumped in the last quarter, to 896,000. That\u2019s up from 791,000 a year ago, and close to the record high recorded in 2016 -- before concerns grew that people were being exploited by not being promised guaranteed work. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady is concerned: \u201cIt\u2019s no surprise zero-hours contracts are rising when ministers have failed to crack down on unfair employment practices. The government must ban zero-hours contracts so that all workers can have solid jobs with full workers\u2019 rights.\u201d Today\u2019s jobs report could calm fears that Britain is heading into recession, having shrunk by 0.2% in April-June. Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, says: \u201cThe days of sharply falling unemployment are behind us, but a tight labour market points to further gains in wages and spending power. Despite a second quarter decline in growth, the UK economy still has momentum.\u201d Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, fears that the UK jobs market could be peaking. He cites the drop in vacancies, and the rise in unemployment in the last quarter, which take the shine off the strong wage growth. While competition has pushed up salaries, thin margins and low productivity may set a ceiling for pay growth. Although vacancies remain high by historic standards, the number has been dropping since the start of the year. \u201cImpressive jobs market data should not lull policymakers into a false sense of confidence. As it becomes harder to find talent, businesses will need better access to training courses and a flexible immigration system to meet their skill needs.\u201d The government will be relieved to see wages growing and employment rising, as Brexit could be just 80 days away. Amber Rudd, Secretary of State for Work and Pensions and Minister for Women and Equalities, says: \u201cMore people in work than ever before means more households across the UK are earning a regular income, and millions more receiving a pay boost thanks to wages rising at their fastest in a decade \u2013 outstripping inflation for a 17th month in a row. \u201cOur workforce increasingly reflects our vibrant society, with a record number of women in employment while the number out of work falls to an all-time low. \u201cThis week many young people will receive their A Level results and begin their career journey. They should know that they are entering a workforce that is flourishing and full of opportunity and I hope all young people, especially women, feel empowered to flourish in every role in every sector.\u201d The number of workers with non-UK nationality increased by 133,000 on the year to 3.66 million. Here\u2019s a breakdown from today\u2019s jobs report: Europe: +118,000 Africa: +28,000 Pakistan and Bangladesh: + 20,000. But there were decreases in workers from some countries: India -23,000, the USA -14,000), Romania and Bulgaria -12,000) New Zealand and Australia -9,000). In total, 2.49 million of those non-UK workers were from the rest of Europe and 1.17 million were from elsewhere in the world. This chart shows clearly that UK wages are still below their pre-crisis levels (the blue line), despite jumping by 3.9% in the last year. Here\u2019s Matt Hughes, deputy head of labour market statistics at the ONS: Women drove the increase in employment in the last quarter. The ONS reports that the number of women employees rose by 74,000 in the last quarter, while the number of men in work only increased by rose by 2,000. The number of self-employed women increased by 51,000 over the same period, while the number of self-employed men dropped by 23,000. This is partly because of changes to the State Pension age for women, resulting in fewer women retiring between the ages of 60 and 65 years. On the other hand, men drove the 31,000 increase in unemployment last month. Around 40,000 more men were classed as unemployed, while the number of unemployed women reduced by 9,000 on the quarter. Worryingly, the number of vacancies at UK firms has fallen. There are now around 820,000 unfilled vacancies, down from 861,000 at the start of 2019. That\u2019s still a substantial amount, suggesting firms are struggling to find staff with the right skills or qualifications. But the decrease could be a sign that firms are more cautious about hiring. Pay increases for some NHS staff, and the new national minimum wage, helped to push UK wage growth up. But.... wages are still below their levels before the financial crisis, once you adjust for inflation. The ONS says: For June 2019, average regular pay, before tax and other deductions, for employees in Great Britain was estimated at: 1) \u00a3505 per week in nominal terms 2) \u00a3469 per week in real terms (constant 2015 prices), higher than the estimate for a year earlier (\u00a3460 per week), but \u00a34 (0.8%) lower than the pre-recession peak of \u00a3473 per week for April 2008. Total pay, including bonuses, grew by 3.7% per annum in April-June -- again, the fastest growth since 2008. Newsflash: UK wages have risen at their fastest rate in over a decade, but the unemployment rate has also increased. The latest labour force survey, just released, shows that basic pay (excluding bonuses) grew by 3.9% per year in the April-June period. That\u2019s up from 3.6% a month ago, and the biggest jump in wages since 2008 (although this doesn\u2019t include inflation). That\u2019s a relief for workers, as it suggests Brexit uncertainty isn\u2019t hitting pay packets. The Office for National Statistics also reports that the jobless rate rose to 3.9%, from 3.8% a month ago (that\u2019s still very low in historic terms). It also found that employment increased by 115,000 to reach a record high of 32.81 million, while unemployment increased by 31,000 to 1.33 million. More to follow.... Silver is also rallying today: Gold is continuing to rise, and is now up $15 per ounce at $1,526, the highest since April 2013. Neil Wilson of Markets.com cites a list of worries: Brexit, US-China trade, Argentina, Italy, Iran, Hong Kong - you can take your pick from the smorgasbord of risks facing the world right now. Risk assets are being hit as investors are rattled by civil strife in Hong Kong, the crash in the Argentine peso and mounting doubts about the global economy. Equity indices have taken fright on a mix of factors, but chiefly I would say for the US at least it is the persistent damage being done to the global economy from trade disputes. Overnight Singapore cut its growth estimates for the year drastically because of US-China trade strife and a slowdown in the global electronics cycle, which has traders worried about the read across for other Asian economies. Overnight, Singapore has added to concerns that the global economy is slowing by cutting its growth forecasts. Singapore now expects growth of between 0% and 1% this year, down from 1.5% to 2.5% previously. Its trade ministry blamed \u201cstrong headwinds\u201d, including the US-China trade war and a downturn in the global electronics cycle. \u201cThe growth prospects of key emerging markets and developing economies... and China have worsened, partly due to the escalation of the US-China trade conflict in recent months. Uncertainties and downside risks in the global economy have increased since three months ago.\u201d Singapore grew by 3.2% in 2018, but its exporters have suffered from rising trade tensions and weaker demand for its electronics and machinery exports. The market rout following Argentina\u2019s presidential primary election was particularly bad news for those optimists who bought its latest 100-year bond. The \u2018century bond\u2019 was issued two years ago, and proved remarkably popular with investors. Many were hopeful that President Macri would reform Argentina\u2019s economy, tame inflation and deliver growth. Instead, public anger has grown following a new IMF bailout, spending cuts and high interest rates - leading to Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s victory over Macri last weekend. The value of the century bond has now plunged to record lows, below 60% of its face value, as fears of a debt default rise. Nervous investors are also piling into government bonds. This flood of money is driving prices higher, pushing down the rate of return on the debt. This means more bonds are trading with a negative yield -- ie, you lose money if you hold them until they mature. Germany\u2019s 10-year bund has hit a new record high this morning, with a yield of minus 0.6%. In other words, investors will pay Berlin for the chance to lend it money for the next decade. This is another sign of anxiety over global growth prospects. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale says: Last week, Monday started badly but Tuesday saw a marked improvement in sentiment. This week, it\u2019s very much the other way around after protests in Hong Kong and political uncertainty in Argentina really worried markets and bond yields slide further. Kit also flags up a new piece by John Authers on Bloomberg, arguing that the bond market meets Charles Kindleberger\u2019s four criteria for a bubble: Created by cheap money, financed with debt, supported by excessive valuations and justified with a convincing narrative. Stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region have fallen into the red today, as investors ditch shares. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng fell 2% to its lowest level since January, as the ongoing clashes between protestors and police spooked markets. Japan\u2019s Nikkei fell 1.1%, closely followed by South Korea\u2019s Kospi (-1%) and China\u2019s CSI 300 (-1%). Stephen Innes of VM Markets in Singapore says the selloff was triggered by Beijing: Chinese authorities suggested the Hong Kong protests are the \u201cfirst signs of terrorism\u201d. Dropping the \u201cT\u201d word is particularly disturbing as it does suggest a more aggressive mainland response, which triggered a wave of risk aversion across global markets. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors have a lot to worry about today, with a currency crisis in Argentina, mass demonstrations in Hong Kong, and plenty of signs that the global economy is slowing. These concerns are driving them into safe haven assets, and top of the list is gold. Bullion prices have soared to a new six-year high this morning, with gold changing hands for $1,523 per ounce - up 1% today. This is the highest level since 2013; as this chart shows, gold has surged by almost 20% in the last three months. Ilya Spivak, senior currency strategist with DailyFx, says traders are increasingly concerned that an economic downturn is looming. \u201cIt is a pretty straight forward case of risk aversion. Crisis in Argentina and political deterioration in Hong Kong; underlying all of this, global growth is slowing. \u201cCentral banks can only do so much because a lot of them are at near record low interest rates. There is not a lot of ammunition to deploy as counter measures to the slowdown in global growth.\u201d Gold\u2019s latest rally follows a bad day on Wall Street yesterday, where the Dow Jones industrial average lost 389 points, or almost 1.5%, back to 25,897 points. That followed a shocking day in Argentina, where the Buenos Aires market plunged by 30% (!) after left-wing politician Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez scored a stunning victory over Conservative President Mauricio Macri in Sunday\u2019s primary elections. The peso also suffered a dramatic slump, to fresh record lows, as the markets faced the prospect of a new Argentinian debt crisis. My colleague Richard Partington explains: Argentina and several other developing nations have come under growing pressure over their high levels of foreign currency debt. The US dollar has appreciated in value as the US Federal Reserve has lifted interest rates, which has made it more expensive for these countries to repay their dollar-denominated debts. Macri, the son of a self-made construction tycoon, had made \u201czero inflation\u201d a campaign pledge before he came to power in 2015. In reality it has soared to more than 50% as the peso has weakened. Considered a market-friendly leader, Macri has used austerity measures in an effort to stem the country\u2019s currency crisis, provoking an angry public response. Argentina relies on support from the International Monetary Fund through a $57bn (\u00a347.2bn) loan intended to shore up the country\u2019s ailing finances. Anxiety over the protests in Hong Kong has also risen, following the shutdown of its airport yesterday. Several world leaders are pushing for calm, amid fears that China could resort to military action to crush the pro-democracy movement. Also coming up today The latest UK unemployment report, due this morning, could show that Britain\u2019s labour market is still managing Brexit uncertainty. Economists predict that basic wage growth picked up to 3.8% per year in the second quarter of 2019, up from 3.6% a month ago. The jobless rate is expected to stick at 3.8%, the lowest in over 40 years, even though the UK shrank during the last quarter. The ZEW Institute\u2019s survey of business confidence is due this morning, and could show that German investors are gloomier, due to trade war worries and the global slowdown. Investors will also scrutinise the latest US inflation data. It could show that consumer prices rose by 0.3% last month, or 1.7% per year.

      "bodyText": "A Danish bank has launched the world\u2019s first negative interest rate mortgage \u2013 handing out loans to homeowners where the charge is minus 0.5% a year. Negative interest rates effectively mean that a bank pays a borrower to take money off their hands, so they pay back less than they have been loaned. Jyske Bank, Denmark\u2019s third largest, has begun offering borrowers a 10-year deal at -0.5%, while another Danish bank, Nordea, says it will begin offering 20-year fixed-rate deals at 0% and a 30-year mortgage at 0.5%. Under its negative mortgage, Jyske said borrowers will make a monthly repayment as usual \u2013 but the amount still outstanding will be reduced each month by more than the borrower has paid. \u201cWe don\u2019t give you money directly in your hand, but every month your debt is reduced by more than the amount you pay,\u201d said Jyske\u2019s housing economist, Mikkel H\u00f8egh. In recognition of how puzzling the new mortgage is for customers, the bank\u2019s FAQ is littered with questions and statements such as Hvordan kan det lade sig g\u00f8re? (How is that possible?) and Ja, du l\u00e6ste rigtigt (Yes, you read that right). The mortgage is possible because Denmark, as well as Sweden and Switzerland, has seen rates in money markets drop to levels that turn banking upside-down. H\u00f8egh said Jyske Bank is able to go into money markets and borrow from institutional investors at a negative rate, and is simply passing this on to its customers. But the flipside is that savers will see nothing paid in interest on their deposits \u2013 and may also suffer as they go negative. In Switzerland, the bank UBS last week told its wealthy clients that it would introduce a charge of 0.6% a year if they deposited more than \u20ac500,000. In Denmark, interest rates on savings deposited in Jyske \u2013 a Danish equivalent to Halifax or Nationwide in the UK \u2013 have already fallen to zero. Now banks in Denmark are thinking of following Switzerland and moving to negative rates on deposits. \u201cRight now, for deposits we don\u2019t have a negative interest rate.

While the Bank of England\u2019s base rate is 0.75%, and the European Central Bank\u2019s main rate is zero, in Denmark (which is not in the eurozone) the equivalent rate is -0.4%. In reality, the Jyske mortgage borrower in Denmark is likely to end up paying back a little more than they borrowed, as there are still fees and charges to pay to compensate the bank for arranging the deal, even when the nominal rate is negative. In the UK, although the Bank of England has not cut its base rate, the yields on bonds in money markets have, as in the rest of Europe, fallen heavily, with gilts trading at record lows. While no one is predicting negative interest rates on UK mortgages, banks have begun cutting rates on fixed-rate deals. Barclays this week cut rates on 15 of its mortgages, leapfrogging its rival NatWest to the top of the best-buy tables on five-year deals. Three years ago, when gilts yields in the UK were last at the levels common today, NatWest warned its business customers that it may have to charge for accepting deposits, although the charge was never actually introduced.",

      "bodyText": "The archbishop of Canterbury is expected to come under scrutiny in an independent review ordered by the Church of England into allegations of sadistic beatings of boys at Christian holiday camps. Two key organisations have declined to take part in the review. The review, announced by the church on Tuesday, will examine its handling of claims that John Smyth QC carried out violent beatings of boys and young men in the 1970s and 80s. Smyth met his alleged victims, many of whom attended Winchester College, a public school, at \u201cBash camps\u201d. Justin Welby worked at the evangelical holiday camps, financed by the Iwerne Trust, as a \u201cdormitory officer\u201d in the 1970s, and was acquainted with Smyth, who was chairman of the trust between 1974 and 1981. Lambeth Palace, the archbishop\u2019s headquarters, is expected to hand to the review team documents in Welby\u2019s possession which relate to the abuse allegations or action taken in connection with the claims. Welby may also agree to give evidence. However, the Titus Trust, which took over the activities of the Iwerne Trust when it was wound up in 1997, has said it is restricted by legal action from fully participating in the review. The Scripture Union, which managed the camps, has also told the church it will not participate. Smyth died from a heart attack last August shortly before he was due to be extradited to the UK from his home in Cape Town to be interviewed by Hampshire police about the allegations. Hampshire police opened an investigation in 2017 into the claims following an expos\u00e9 by Channel 4 News. At the time, Welby said he had been \u201ccompletely unaware\u201d of any abuse by Smyth when he worked at the camps, and that he first knew of the allegations in 2013. He recalled Smyth as \u201ca charming, delightful, very clever, brilliant speaker\u201d, but said he \u201cwasn\u2019t in his inner circle\u201d. He also issued an \u201cunreserved and unequivocal\u201d apology on behalf of the Church of England, admitting that it had \u201cfailed terribly\u201d to tackle institutional abuse. The review will be led by Keith Makin, a former director of social services, and will examine the response to the Smyth allegations by the church, the Titus Trust, the Scripture Union and Winchester College. The latter has agreed to cooperate and provide all relevant documentation. The Iwerne Trust invited boys and young men from public schools and top universities to attend holiday camps, with the aim of ensuring that future members of the establishment were committed Christians. Winchester College knew in 1982 of allegations of sadomasochistic abuse by Smyth of boys and young men he met at the camps, known as \u201cBash camps\u201d after the nickname of their founder, EJH Nash. Smyth invited them to his Hampshire home, where he beat them in his garden shed, it is claimed. An unpublished report commissioned by the Iwerne Trust in 1982 described \u201chorrific\u201d beatings of teenage boys, sometimes until they bled. But neither the college nor the trust reported Smyth to the police. Instead, Winchester\u2019s headmaster asked Smyth never again to enter the college or contact its pupils. Among Smyth\u2019s alleged victims was Andrew Watson, now the bishop of Guildford, who has said he was subjected to a \u201cviolent, excruciating and shocking\u201d beating in the former QC\u2019s garden shed. Smyth moved to Zimbabwe, where he was the subject of allegations of physical abuse by boys in his care at holiday camps he ran. In 1992, he faced charges of killing a 16-year-old boy found dead in a swimming pool at one of the holiday camps, but the case was dismissed in 1998. Smyth later moved to Cape Town. Six months before his death, he was removed as a leader of his local church after claims of inappropriate behaviour and a \u201cheavy-handed style of leadership\u201d. Announcing the review, Peter Hancock, the Church of England\u2019s lead safeguarding bishop, said: \u201cI know for survivors of John Smyth this review into the church\u2019s response \u2013 and the response of others \u2013 is vital to them. It was their bravery in coming forward that finally brought the abuse perpetrated by Smyth to the attention of the police and wider church.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>In September 2017, my father, the prominent Saudi reformist Muslim scholar Salman al-Odah, tweeted an innocuous message to his 14 million followers encouraging the government to end its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/05/saudi-arabia-and-bahrain-break-diplomatic-ties-with-qatar-over-terrorism\" title=\"\">diplomatic standoff</a> with Qatar. A few hours later he was taken from our home by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/14/saudi-crown-prince-consolidate-power-arrests-clerics-mohammed-bin-salman\" title=\"\">state security officials</a>. He now faces the prospect of being executed on charges that include spreading corruption by calling for a constitutional monarchy, stirring public discord, incitement and \u201cmocking the government\u2019s achievements\u201d.</p> <p>Since his arrest he has been held in solitary confinement, where he remains today. He has been mistreated, handcuffed, blindfolded and chained inside his cell, and deprived of sleep and medications \u2013 so much so that after five months he had to be taken to hospital. Seventeen members of my family have been banned from travelling; my uncle Khalid was arrested because he tweeted about my father; and I was asked by the Saudi embassy in Washington to go back to Saudi Arabia to \u201crenew my passport\u201d, which has been frozen.</p> <p>A year after he was taken, my father appeared in front of the notorious specialised criminal court. The SCC was established in 2008 with the sole purpose of prosecuting terror suspects; but since then it has become a tool to hammer out any dissent or activism within the kingdom. It does this either by cowing critics into silence by way of its fearsome reputation, or silencing them permanently by imposing the death penalty. Prosecutions brought before the SCC are often politically motivated with charges so vague \u2013 such as the \u201cmocking\u201d accusation against my father \u2013 that they would be laughable were the consequences not so grave.</p> <p>Article 30 of the anti-terrorism law criminalises \u201cdirectly or indirectly describing the king or the crown prince by any description that defames [their] religion or justice\u201d and considers it an act of terrorism punishable by a minimum of five years in prison. The law further labels as terrorist many rights and activities protected by democratic systems around the world, such as \u201cpressing the state to carry out an act or abstain from doing so\u201d; and its vague language allows the state to arrest anyone on terrorism charges for \u201charming the kingdom\u2019s interests, economy, or national security\u201d. It is this precise law that allowed the state to try the two prominent women\u2019s rights activists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/13/saudi-womens-rights-activists-go-on-trial-in-riyadh\" title=\"\">Loujain al-Hathloul and Maysa al-Amoudi</a> in the terrorism court for defying the ban on women driving in 2014.</p> <p>SCC judges are pressured by the government to hand down the strongest sentence possible. In Saudi Arabia this means beheading or even crucifixion. Last year six judges from the SCC were arrested and interrogated when the outcome of cases they presided over did not meet the attorney general\u2019s expectations. In one case, a judge who exonerated the accused was subsequently held under arrest for many months.</p> <p>This is the context within which my father was supposed to go to court on 28 July to find out if he was going to be executed. He was, however, not even taken to the court and all we know is that his hearing has been postponed to November. Everything about his case has been completely illegal and unjust. Sadly, my father is by no means the only individual who faces the death penalty on trumped-up charges, nor is he the only prisoner to have been treated so badly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aaf2633ace934fe50d139039d5e58719a79c351a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aaf2633ace934fe50d139039d5e58719a79c351a/0_33_1029_617/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mohammed bin Salman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/mohammed-bin-salman\">Mohammed bin Salman</a> came to power in Saudi Arabia in 2017, there has been a marked increase in the number of executions.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jorge Silva/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many of the others awaiting execution were also sentenced by the SCC for similarly vague, politically motivated charges. In a new report that I have given testimony to the British lawyer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/helena-kennedy\" title=\"\">Helena Kennedy</a> recommends that everyone currently awaiting the death penalty should have the reasons for their sentence published immediately. Many of those held, such as my father, have said things so innocent and inoffensive that it is clear this is a weak government that cannot handle even the smallest suggestion, let alone criticism.</p> <p>The Saudi authorities have, of course, resorted to lethal methods beyond the judicial system too \u2013 most notably in the gruesome killing of my friend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/21/death-of-dissident-jamal-khashoggi-mohammed-bin-salman\" title=\"\">Jamal Khashoggi</a>. However, the court-sanctioned route remains the most popular. What has been done to Khashoggi extrajudicially is possibly what my father faces judicially.</p> <p>Since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/mohammed-bin-salman\" title=\"\">Mohammed bin Salman</a> came to power in Saudi Arabia in 2017 there appears to have been a marked increase in the number of executions. In 2010 there were just 27 confirmed. In 2015 158 people were executed, most of whom had participated in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/11/saudi-arabia-police-quell-protests\" title=\"\">Arab spring protests</a> a few years earlier. But this year there have already been 134 victims, with at least 24 more at risk of imminent execution, including my father.</p> <p>This excess is part of a concerted effort by the Saudi authorities to quash dissent and silence political activists and human rights defenders. It is right that we are outraged. But recent events have demonstrated that international outrage is not enough. Baroness Kennedy\u2019s report recommends that an independent team goes to Saudi Arabia to investigate what is actually happening. We need to push for this.</p> <p>If they execute my father it will be state-sanctioned murder and they cannot be allowed to get away with it.</p> <p>\u2022 Abdullah Alaoudh is a Saudi legal scholar and senior fellow at Georgetown University in Washington DC</p>",

He now faces the prospect of being executed on charges that include spreading corruption by calling for a constitutional monarchy, stirring public discord, incitement and \u201cmocking the government\u2019s achievements\u201d. Since his arrest he has been held in solitary confinement, where he remains today. He has been mistreated, handcuffed, blindfolded and chained inside his cell, and deprived of sleep and medications \u2013 so much so that after five months he had to be taken to hospital. Seventeen members of my family have been banned from travelling; my uncle Khalid was arrested because he tweeted about my father; and I was asked by the Saudi embassy in Washington to go back to Saudi Arabia to \u201crenew my passport\u201d, which has been frozen. A year after he was taken, my father appeared in front of the notorious specialised criminal court. The SCC was established in 2008 with the sole purpose of prosecuting terror suspects; but since then it has become a tool to hammer out any dissent or activism within the kingdom. It does this either by cowing critics into silence by way of its fearsome reputation, or silencing them permanently by imposing the death penalty. Prosecutions brought before the SCC are often politically motivated with charges so vague \u2013 such as the \u201cmocking\u201d accusation against my father \u2013 that they would be laughable were the consequences not so grave. Article 30 of the anti-terrorism law criminalises \u201cdirectly or indirectly describing the king or the crown prince by any description that defames [their] religion or justice\u201d and considers it an act of terrorism punishable by a minimum of five years in prison. The law further labels as terrorist many rights and activities protected by democratic systems around the world, such as \u201cpressing the state to carry out an act or abstain from doing so\u201d; and its vague language allows the state to arrest anyone on terrorism charges for \u201charming the kingdom\u2019s interests, economy, or national security\u201d. It is this precise law that allowed the state to try the two prominent women\u2019s rights activists Loujain al-Hathloul and Maysa al-Amoudi in the terrorism court for defying the ban on women driving in 2014. SCC judges are pressured by the government to hand down the strongest sentence possible. In Saudi Arabia this means beheading or even crucifixion. Last year six judges from the SCC were arrested and interrogated when the outcome of cases they presided over did not meet the attorney general\u2019s expectations. In one case, a judge who exonerated the accused was subsequently held under arrest for many months. This is the context within which my father was supposed to go to court on 28 July to find out if he was going to be executed. He was, however, not even taken to the court and all we know is that his hearing has been postponed to November. Everything about his case has been completely illegal and unjust. Sadly, my father is by no means the only individual who faces the death penalty on trumped-up charges, nor is he the only prisoner to have been treated so badly. Many of the others awaiting execution were also sentenced by the SCC for similarly vague, politically motivated charges. In a new report that I have given testimony to the British lawyer Helena Kennedy recommends that everyone currently awaiting the death penalty should have the reasons for their sentence published immediately. Many of those held, such as my father, have said things so innocent and inoffensive that it is clear this is a weak government that cannot handle even the smallest suggestion, let alone criticism. The Saudi authorities have, of course, resorted to lethal methods beyond the judicial system too \u2013 most notably in the gruesome killing of my friend Jamal Khashoggi. However, the court-sanctioned route remains the most popular. What has been done to Khashoggi extrajudicially is possibly what my father faces judicially. Since Mohammed bin Salman came to power in Saudi Arabia in 2017 there appears to have been a marked increase in the number of executions. In 2010 there were just 27 confirmed. In 2015 158 people were executed, most of whom had participated in Arab spring protests a few years earlier. But this year there have already been 134 victims, with at least 24 more at risk of imminent execution, including my father. This excess is part of a concerted effort by the Saudi authorities to quash dissent and silence political activists and human rights defenders. It is right that we are outraged. But recent events have demonstrated that international outrage is not enough. Baroness Kennedy\u2019s report recommends that an independent team goes to Saudi Arabia to investigate what is actually happening. We need to push for this. If they execute my father it will be state-sanctioned murder and they cannot be allowed to get away with it. \u2022 Abdullah Alaoudh is a Saudi legal scholar and senior fellow at Georgetown University in Washington DC",

Now, after 15 years living inside the minds of the world\u2019s best batsmen, Steyn has finally decided to move out. Last week he quit Test cricket, after 93 matches, with 439 wickets at just under 23 runs each.</p> <p>Something snapped in 2007. He had already been playing Test cricket for three years, had taken his first 51 wickets in 13 Tests at 30 runs apiece. That winter, New Zealand came on tour. They had a guy called Craig Cumming opening for them. A couple of years earlier Cumming had faced down the fastest spell Brett Lee ever bowled, when a couple of his deliveries had been clocked at 99mph on the speed gun. But Steyn was something else again. Not faster, but harder. \u201cThe pull and hook were shots I played through my career,\u201d Cumming said. <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/7095923.stm\" title=\"\">And he was set, on 48</a>. \u201cBefore I knew it, I was taking off my helmet with a bit of blood pumping out my face.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The harder it got, the more it hurt, the more it hurt, the angrier he was, the angrier he was, the better he bowled</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Cumming retired hurt. He played another five years for Otago, but only one more Test. Steyn took 20 wickets in that series, five for 34, five for 59, four for 42, six for 49. It was the cheapest, deadliest bowling anyone had seen in more than a hundred years, since George Lohmann finished. And he was only just getting started.</p> <p>In the next eight years, Steyn took 351 wickets in 68 Tests, average 21, strike rate 41. Few players have taken as many wickets so cheaply, none have taken them so frequently. And Steyn did it in an era when batsmen were averaging more runs per wicket than they had done at any time since the 1940s, and quicks were conceding more runs per wicket than they had done at any time since the 1920s. There had never been a worse time to be a fast bowler.</p> <p>Which is why everyone else was fretting about the <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/537876.html\" title=\"\">decline of fast bowling</a>, worrying about whether the pitches were too flat or the bats too big or the workloads too heavy or the schedule too busy or the laws too unfair. It didn\u2019t deter Steyn, but seemed to spur him on. The harder it got, the more it hurt; the more it hurt, the angrier he was; the angrier he was, the better he bowled. It\u2019s why he always seemed to go so well on flat, thankless pitches in the subcontinent. \u201cI always need that fire,\u201d he said. \u201cIf anybody tries to extinguish that fire or make me be different, then I am not going to be any use to a team. I need the mongrel, the aggro, in my game.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/aug/11/cricket-world-test-championship\">Why it is hard to be carried away by the World Test Championship | Emma John</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He finished as the only man in history to take five-for against nine Test nations, who has, in his time, run through every team he has played against. Five for 67 against Australia at the MCG, five for 51 against England at the Wanderers, seven for 51 against India in Nagpur, he got the better of the best batsmen of his generation. He was too good for his contemporaries, so best measured, instead, against great bowlers who came before him.</p> <p>Steyn was just a few days ahead of his teammate Hashim Amla, who retired from all international cricket last week. If Amla, who made 28 Test centuries, was one of the great players of his generation, then Steyn was one of the greatest, an unequivocal pick to open the bowling in a 21st-century World XI.</p>",

Steyn once said it was the most satisfying wicket he took. \u201cEvery time I play against you, I want you to remember who I am,\u201d Steyn explained, \u201cI want you to go to bed at night and know when you are playing South Africa tomorrow you have to face me.\u2019\u201d Anger is an energy. \u201cDale,\u201d said his teammate Morne Morkel, \u201chas enough of it for the two of us.\u201d It wasn\u2019t just Ponting, he felt the same way about all the great batsmen. \u201cRicky, Virat, Michael Clarke, Alastair Cook \u2013 I want them to go at night time thinking, \u2018Ah, I have to face this guy tomorrow.\u2019\u201d Steyn got Kohli four times, Cook five, and Clarke 10, but then Clarke once made the mistake of calling Steyn a \u201ccheat\u201d during a game at Newlands. Now, after 15 years living inside the minds of the world\u2019s best batsmen, Steyn has finally decided to move out. Last week he quit Test cricket, after 93 matches, with 439 wickets at just under 23 runs each. Something snapped in 2007. He had already been playing Test cricket for three years, had taken his first 51 wickets in 13 Tests at 30 runs apiece. That winter, New Zealand came on tour. They had a guy called Craig Cumming opening for them. A couple of years earlier Cumming had faced down the fastest spell Brett Lee ever bowled, when a couple of his deliveries had been clocked at 99mph on the speed gun. But Steyn was something else again. Not faster, but harder. \u201cThe pull and hook were shots I played through my career,\u201d Cumming said. And he was set, on 48. \u201cBefore I knew it, I was taking off my helmet with a bit of blood pumping out my face.\u201d Cumming retired hurt. He played another five years for Otago, but only one more Test. Steyn took 20 wickets in that series, five for 34, five for 59, four for 42, six for 49. It was the cheapest, deadliest bowling anyone had seen in more than a hundred years, since George Lohmann finished. And he was only just getting started. In the next eight years, Steyn took 351 wickets in 68 Tests, average 21, strike rate 41. Few players have taken as many wickets so cheaply, none have taken them so frequently. And Steyn did it in an era when batsmen were averaging more runs per wicket than they had done at any time since the 1940s, and quicks were conceding more runs per wicket than they had done at any time since the 1920s. There had never been a worse time to be a fast bowler. Which is why everyone else was fretting about the decline of fast bowling, worrying about whether the pitches were too flat or the bats too big or the workloads too heavy or the schedule too busy or the laws too unfair. It didn\u2019t deter Steyn, but seemed to spur him on. The harder it got, the more it hurt; the more it hurt, the angrier he was; the angrier he was, the better he bowled. It\u2019s why he always seemed to go so well on flat, thankless pitches in the subcontinent. \u201cI always need that fire,\u201d he said. \u201cIf anybody tries to extinguish that fire or make me be different, then I am not going to be any use to a team. I need the mongrel, the aggro, in my game.\u201d He finished as the only man in history to take five-for against nine Test nations, who has, in his time, run through every team he has played against. Five for 67 against Australia at the MCG, five for 51 against England at the Wanderers, seven for 51 against India in Nagpur, he got the better of the best batsmen of his generation. He was too good for his contemporaries, so best measured, instead, against great bowlers who came before him. Steyn was just a few days ahead of his teammate Hashim Amla, who retired from all international cricket last week. If Amla, who made 28 Test centuries, was one of the great players of his generation, then Steyn was one of the greatest, an unequivocal pick to open the bowling in a 21st-century World XI.",

And Bartlett Sher\u2019s My Fair Lady, which closed this spring, lifted an odd line and scene from the 1938 Pygmalion movie, the better to expose the feminism already encoded in the show\u2019s DNA, showing how Eliza\u2019s path to selfhood didn\u2019t include submitting to a man who couldn\u2019t admit to loving her.

      "bodyText": "Confusion swirled over a possible breakthrough in the tanker standoff in the Middle East on Tuesday after Gibraltar scotched Iranian media reports that an Iranian tanker was due to be released. The Fars news agency said that Grace 1, seized by British Royal Marines off Gibraltar on suspicion that it was taking 2.1m barrels of oil to Syria in breach of an EU arms embargo, was going to be released on Tuesday evening. The report cited Gibraltar authorities, but a source for the government of the British Mediterranean territory told Reuters it was not correct. The seizure of the boat on 4 July led to reprisals by Iran, including the capture of the British-flagged Stena Impero. Both incidents fuelled worsening hostilities between Iran and the west that began when Washington pulled out of an international agreement curbing Iran\u2019s nuclear programme last year and reimposed economic sanctions. A court in Gibraltar is to decide the fate of the ship on Thursday, when an order for its detention lapses. Britain had said there would be serious consequences if Iran did not release the British-flagged tanker, and behind the scenes there have been negotiations on how to resolve the dual crisis. Formally, the Foreign Office and Iran say there is no link between the two boat seizures. On Tuesday the Foreign Office said the ship\u2019s status was a matter for Gibraltar. The Stena Impero\u2019s owners have said its 23 personnel on board have been properly treated by the Iranians since their capture. The initial British capture of Grace 1 was always regarded as controversial, both politically and legally. The Foreign Office faced private criticism that its decision to back a move to enforce EU sanctions in such a novel way was always likely to lead to an Iranian reaction just as the Iran nuclear deal was coming under such pressure. Iran, responding to the mounting US economic sanctions, has withdrawn from aspects of the nuclear deal covering the limits on enriching uranium and its stockpiles of uranium. It was the first time the UK had enforced the EU embargo on oil sales to Syria in this way. The UK acknowledged it had acted after pressure from the US, including intelligence that the boat was carrying oil bound for the regime of President Assad. It was also a surprise to the UK that Grace 1 strayed from international into Gibraltarian waters, so making the capture of the ship possible. There have also been legal question marks over whether the seizure was compliant with international law, since Iran was not subject to the EU-imposed embargo, but many experts said the port to which the ship was bound was a sanctioned entity, and therefore the UK act was lawful under EU law. Talks between Iranian officials and the Foreign Office conducted in London last month failed to resolve the crisis after the UK demanded assurances that the ship\u2019s cargo would not proceed to Syria. Iran insisted that it had a right to sell oil to Syria or any other country it wished. The US has separately threatened to impose sanctions on any country that imports oil from Iran. Oil exports are vital to the Iranian economy and it has responded to the growing stranglehold by taking a more aggressive posture on the Strait of Hormuz, the waterway that Iran regards as its preserve. If the breakthrough does happen, it will change some of the atmosphere around the nuclear deal ahead of the G7 summit of world economic powers in Biarritz at the end of the month. The rival European and US approaches to the Iranian regime are likely to be central to the summit.",

      "bodyText": "In popular myth they are an aggressive new \u201csuper\u201d species pushing out the grey squirrel just as it has displaced the red squirrel. But the black squirrels seen scampering through southern England are a form of grey squirrel created by wild interbreeding between greys and fox squirrels in North America, according to research. Black squirrels are the same species as the grey but acquired their coat through a faulty pigment gene identical to that found in the fox squirrel, a closely related species that is also native to North America and has black variants. Helen McRobie of Anglia Ruskin University worked with colleagues from Cambridge University and the Virginia Museum of Natural History in the US to test DNA from grey and fox squirrels across North America. They discovered that other \u201csignatures\u201d on the mutated gene were more closely related to the fox squirrel, suggesting the mutation probably arose in the fox squirrel and passed to the grey through interbreeding. McRobie said the most likely explanation for the black version of the gene being found in the grey squirrel was the result of a black fox squirrel joining a grey squirrel \u201cmating chase\u201d and mating with a female grey. \u201cThe fact black grey squirrels have become so common right across North America is possibly because black fur offers a thermal advantage, helping them inhabit regions with extremely cold winters,\u201d she said. \u201cThis may have contributed to the expansion of the grey squirrel\u2019s range during the past 11,000 years, following the end of the most recent ice age, helping them spread further north into Canada.\u201d In Britain, black squirrels were imported from North America and then escaped from private zoos. The first was spotted near Letchworth in 1912; today black squirrels are most commonly seen across Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire and Cambridgeshire. The spread of grey \u2013 and black \u2013 squirrels has caused the extinction of red squirrels in much of England because the native reds succumb to the squirrelpox virus, which is carried by greys but leaves them unscathed. Another study in which grey squirrels on the Wirral were tested for squirrelpox every month has found that greys survive in the wild even when carrying the virus for months. Prof Julian Chantrey and colleagues at Liverpool University tested more than 100 grey squirrels over 16months. In research published in the journal Epidemics, they found the squirrelpox virus in more than 80% of grey squirrels, with greys repeatedly reinfected with the virus.

The US, he said, will always choose independence and cooperation over global governance.</p> <p>It is quite clear that if Bolton had his way, Brexit would not just liberate Britain but lead to a wider breakup of the EU. It was notable that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/11/john-bolton-arrives-in-uk-to-seek-support-on-iran-and-huawei\">only Conservatives he planned to meet outside government on his visit</a> were leading figures in the European Research group such as Bernard Jenkin, Iain Duncan Smith and Bill Cash, not exactly a representative cross-section of the Tory benches.</p> <p>In championing US support for Brexit, Bolton brushed aside many of the problems of a no-deal exit or US-UK trade deal. No deal represented no risk to the Good Friday agreement, he asserted.</p> <p>He said he had asked for the threat a US trade deal could pose to the NHS to be explained to him and he had not understood the argument, so he would not comment. Concern about chlorinated chicken being sold to UK consumers was treated largely as a joke.

Bolton said he respected the UK\u2019s short-term need to focus on Brexit, but he laid down markers on the two issues that most concern the US: the role of the Chinese technology company Huawei in the UK\u2019s 5G network and the future of the Iran nuclear deal.</p> <p>On the former he claimed the UK had agreed to reconsider from first principles, an analysis not shared by UK officials. On Iran, Bolton was content to bide his time, possibly believing the deal will collapse anyway, but took note that the Johnson team had already ditched plans for a separate European maritime security operation in the Gulf and would instead come under the umbrella of the US-led Operation Sentinel.</p> <p>But for the Foreign Office to abandon the nuclear deal now would represent such a complete about-face that one imagines senior diplomats would resign. The 2015 deal, brokered by the EU and Obama administration, is seen as one of the great diplomatic achievements of this century, and for Britain to join in Trump\u2019s wilful destruction of it would be seen as an act of obeisance to Washington. It would also infuriate Berlin and Paris, who still think the deal can be rescued.</p> <p>That does not mean the deal will survive. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/23/iran-may-pull-further-away-from-nuclear-deal-after-latest-sanctions\">relentless economic pressure from the US</a> is forcing Tehran to take steps that the UK cannot defend. The forthcoming G7 summit in Biarritz is where some of these issues will likely be played out. It may also be where Johnson finds out the true extent to which Washington wants to pull London away not only from the European Union, but from European values.</p>",

The US, he said, will always choose independence and cooperation over global governance. It is quite clear that if Bolton had his way, Brexit would not just liberate Britain but lead to a wider breakup of the EU. It was notable that the only Conservatives he planned to meet outside government on his visit were leading figures in the European Research group such as Bernard Jenkin, Iain Duncan Smith and Bill Cash, not exactly a representative cross-section of the Tory benches. In championing US support for Brexit, Bolton brushed aside many of the problems of a no-deal exit or US-UK trade deal. No deal represented no risk to the Good Friday agreement, he asserted. He said he had asked for the threat a US trade deal could pose to the NHS to be explained to him and he had not understood the argument, so he would not comment. Concern about chlorinated chicken being sold to UK consumers was treated largely as a joke. The other side of an argument is not somewhere Bolton often frequents. But the bigger picture is the extent to which the UK outside the EU will feel required to come under Washington\u2019s sway. Bolton said he respected the UK\u2019s short-term need to focus on Brexit, but he laid down markers on the two issues that most concern the US: the role of the Chinese technology company Huawei in the UK\u2019s 5G network and the future of the Iran nuclear deal. On the former he claimed the UK had agreed to reconsider from first principles, an analysis not shared by UK officials. On Iran, Bolton was content to bide his time, possibly believing the deal will collapse anyway, but took note that the Johnson team had already ditched plans for a separate European maritime security operation in the Gulf and would instead come under the umbrella of the US-led Operation Sentinel. But for the Foreign Office to abandon the nuclear deal now would represent such a complete about-face that one imagines senior diplomats would resign. The 2015 deal, brokered by the EU and Obama administration, is seen as one of the great diplomatic achievements of this century, and for Britain to join in Trump\u2019s wilful destruction of it would be seen as an act of obeisance to Washington. It would also infuriate Berlin and Paris, who still think the deal can be rescued. That does not mean the deal will survive. The relentless economic pressure from the US is forcing Tehran to take steps that the UK cannot defend. The forthcoming G7 summit in Biarritz is where some of these issues will likely be played out. It may also be where Johnson finds out the true extent to which Washington wants to pull London away not only from the European Union, but from European values.",

Britain\u2019s role in transatlantic slavery is one of the most misrepresented in the national memory \u2013 a tale littered with lies told to hide the dark side of the island\u2019s story.</p> <p>When David Cameron declared Britain should be proud to be the country <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/scottish-independence/scottish-independence-full-text-of-david-camerons-no-going-back-speech-9735902.html\" title=\"\">\u201cthat abolished slavery\u201d</a>, he was merely indulging the national myth. As the 2007 celebrations of the act that abolished the slave trade demonstrated, little attention is paid to much other than white saviours such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2007/apr/03/features11.g2\" title=\"\">William Wilberforce</a>. Truly understanding how Britain\u2019s dominant role in slavery built the nation is essential for any progressive understanding of the present.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Slavery and colonialism embedded racism into the fabric of society and it cannot be educated out</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Britain was not just involved in slavery; it rose to become the premier slave-trading nation. Cities such as London, Liverpool and Bristol were key ports in a global system that enslaved a minimum of 12 million Africans. The wealth generated from slavery provided the basis for not only the port cities. The Manchester mills were only possible with cotton produced by enslaved people, transported through Liverpool. The gun industry of the Midlands was so essential to slavery that it was often remarked in the 18th century that <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2007/03_march/02/birmingham.shtml\" title=\"\">\u201cthe price of a slave was one Birmingham gun\u201d</a>. It is estimated that 150,000 guns from Birmingham were sold in the trade, not to mention the shackles that were also produced in the city. London was not only an important site for ships but also finance. Without insurance, there would have been no voyages, and companies such as Lloyd\u2019s of London underwrote slave-trading voyages. As the Trinidadian intellectual Eric Williams recounts in his classic Capitalism and Slavery, the relationship between finance and slavery was so insidious that when Lloyd\u2019s was just a coffee house, it was the venue the return of runaway slaves.</p> <p>Slavery was an essential part of the development of Britain \u2013 so much so that in order to make abolition possible, slave owners were paid reparations in the largest government bailout in history. British slave owners received \u00a320m to compensate for their losses, which at the time was 40% of the national budget of the Treasury. The government had to take out a loan from the Bank of England so large that it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/12/treasury-tweet-slavery-compensate-slave-owners\" title=\"\">only paid back in 2015</a>. Consider the absurdity and cruelty of the descendants of enslaved people actually paying through our taxes for reparations to the owners of our ancestors.</p> <p>You cannot understand the situation for black people in Britain without understanding these roots. The wealth generated from slavery is still with us, as is the poverty from centuries of exploitation. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/windrush-scandal\" title=\"\">Windrush scandal</a> would never have happened if Africans had not been kidnapped in the first place, or if upon emancipation, enslaved people were given reparations for their labour and the damage inflicted on them. Instead, people were forced to migrate to a land where they were (and continue to be) treated as <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2018/04/19/opinions/racism-as-british-as-a-cup-of-tea-opinion-intl/index.html\" title=\"\">subjects, rather than citizens</a>.</p> <p>But we are on very dangerous ground if we believe a museum is any kind of solution to the deep-seated problem of racism. Although it is a nice fairytale to believe in, racism will not melt away if only people are exposed to the light of the truth. Slavery and colonialism embedded racism into the fabric of society and it cannot be educated out. In fact, <a href=\"http://www.open-access.bcu.ac.uk/5774/1/Andrews%20%282016%29%20Psychosis%20of%20Whiteness-%20Green%20access.pdf\" title=\"\">evidence suggests</a> that when people are given facts about race that challenge racist assumptions, they simply reinterpret them to fit their original perspective. Our historical narratives are delusional precisely because they prevent us from dealing with our complicity in maintaining an unjust racial order.</p> <p>Some of the most \u201ceducated\u201d people end up in government, yet still manage to pursue policy agendas that entrench racial disadvantage. Racism is not in our minds; it is in the schools, prisons and on the streets \u2013 it results in <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/race-disparity-audit\" title=\"\">inequalities across every area</a> of society.</p> <p>We already have an international <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2007/sep/02/heritage.art\" title=\"\">museum of slavery in Liverpool</a>; adding one in London, no matter how critical the message, is not going to have any impact on racial inequality. We should support a new museum because it is an important step in telling a truthful story about Britain. But to pretend this is any solution to racism is actually to obscure just how deeply the problem is ingrained in society.</p> <p>\u2022 Kehinde Andrews is an author and professor of black studies at Birmingham City University</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sadiq Khan has given his backing to a proposal from the Fabian Society to establish a British slavery museum in London in order \u201cto deepen our understanding of the past and strengthen our commitment to fight racism and hatred in all its forms\u201d. Britain\u2019s role in transatlantic slavery is one of the most misrepresented in the national memory \u2013 a tale littered with lies told to hide the dark side of the island\u2019s story. When David Cameron declared Britain should be proud to be the country \u201cthat abolished slavery\u201d, he was merely indulging the national myth. As the 2007 celebrations of the act that abolished the slave trade demonstrated, little attention is paid to much other than white saviours such as William Wilberforce. Truly understanding how Britain\u2019s dominant role in slavery built the nation is essential for any progressive understanding of the present. Britain was not just involved in slavery; it rose to become the premier slave-trading nation. Cities such as London, Liverpool and Bristol were key ports in a global system that enslaved a minimum of 12 million Africans. The wealth generated from slavery provided the basis for not only the port cities. The Manchester mills were only possible with cotton produced by enslaved people, transported through Liverpool. The gun industry of the Midlands was so essential to slavery that it was often remarked in the 18th century that \u201cthe price of a slave was one Birmingham gun\u201d. It is estimated that 150,000 guns from Birmingham were sold in the trade, not to mention the shackles that were also produced in the city. London was not only an important site for ships but also finance. Without insurance, there would have been no voyages, and companies such as Lloyd\u2019s of London underwrote slave-trading voyages. As the Trinidadian intellectual Eric Williams recounts in his classic Capitalism and Slavery, the relationship between finance and slavery was so insidious that when Lloyd\u2019s was just a coffee house, it was the venue the return of runaway slaves. Slavery was an essential part of the development of Britain \u2013 so much so that in order to make abolition possible, slave owners were paid reparations in the largest government bailout in history. British slave owners received \u00a320m to compensate for their losses, which at the time was 40% of the national budget of the Treasury. The government had to take out a loan from the Bank of England so large that it was only paid back in 2015. Consider the absurdity and cruelty of the descendants of enslaved people actually paying through our taxes for reparations to the owners of our ancestors. You cannot understand the situation for black people in Britain without understanding these roots. The wealth generated from slavery is still with us, as is the poverty from centuries of exploitation. The Windrush scandal would never have happened if Africans had not been kidnapped in the first place, or if upon emancipation, enslaved people were given reparations for their labour and the damage inflicted on them. Instead, people were forced to migrate to a land where they were (and continue to be) treated as subjects, rather than citizens. But we are on very dangerous ground if we believe a museum is any kind of solution to the deep-seated problem of racism. Although it is a nice fairytale to believe in, racism will not melt away if only people are exposed to the light of the truth. Slavery and colonialism embedded racism into the fabric of society and it cannot be educated out. In fact, evidence suggests that when people are given facts about race that challenge racist assumptions, they simply reinterpret them to fit their original perspective. Our historical narratives are delusional precisely because they prevent us from dealing with our complicity in maintaining an unjust racial order. Some of the most \u201ceducated\u201d people end up in government, yet still manage to pursue policy agendas that entrench racial disadvantage. Racism is not in our minds; it is in the schools, prisons and on the streets \u2013 it results in inequalities across every area of society. We already have an international museum of slavery in Liverpool; adding one in London, no matter how critical the message, is not going to have any impact on racial inequality. We should support a new museum because it is an important step in telling a truthful story about Britain. But to pretend this is any solution to racism is actually to obscure just how deeply the problem is ingrained in society. \u2022 Kehinde Andrews is an author and professor of black studies at Birmingham City University",

      "body": "<p>A lettings agency that posed as a membership club to dodge tenancy laws has been fined more than \u00a340,000 in the first prosecution of its kind in the UK.</p> <p>Lifestyle Club Ltd pressured tenants to sign a contract without inspecting the terms or the accommodation, charged them a non-refundable \u201cjoining\u201d fee and \u201cmembership\u201d fee worth a month\u2019s rent instead of a deposit, and directed those who complained to a non-existent redress service.</p> <p>The company operated from the same trading address as Lifestyle Club LSC Ltd which was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/may/14/lifestyle-club-london-members-fees-rights\" title=\"\">exposed by the</a> Observer last year. While Lifestyle Club LSC marketed the properties \u2013 aimed at young overseas renters \u2013 tenants\u2019 contracts were with Lifestyle Club Ltd. The terms and conditions reserved the right to evict tenants with seven days\u2019 notice instead of the 28-84 days required by the Tenancy Act.</p> <p>Its terms and conditions allowed its agents the right to enter private rooms unannounced at any time while banning visits from non-members. It required tenants to maintain and replace appliances at their own expense, leave any furniture they had paid for when they moved out and levied large fees for \u201cbreaches\u201d of membership.</p> <p>One group of flat sharers was charged \u00a390 for leaving unwashed dishes in the sink. The companies\u2019 self-employed agents were charged similar levies for breaching sales targets or taking time off.</p> <p>Last week the director of Lifestyle Club Ltd, Gian Paolo Aliatis, was required to pay \u00a342,273 in fines, compensation and costs after pleading guilty to three charges of unfair commercial practice. In a prosecution brought by Islington Trading Standards in London, Aliatis admitted passing the lettings agency off as a membership club to avoid the legal regulations for lettings agents.</p> <p>Under the law, tenants\u2019 deposits must be refundable and paid into a tenancy deposit protection scheme. Aliatis admitted that his firm demanded a non-refundable \u201cjoining\u201d fee. He also admitted pressuring customers into signing a \u201cmembership agreement\u201d without giving them time to read and understand the document, and denying potential tenants the chance to view a property before signing. Rental payments were passed off as a \u201cmonthly contribution fee\u201d.</p> <p>While letting agents are required by law to belong to a registered redress scheme, Lifestyle Club Ltd instead directed anyone who raised a complaint to a fake independent mediation company. Diarmaid Ward, Islington Council\u2019s executive member for housing and development, said: \u201cThis is a major victory for private tenants, not just in Islington but right across the country. Our determined trading standards team has led to a landmark prosecution sending a clear message \u2013 simply changing a few words in the paperwork does not put you above the law.\u201d</p> <p>In March, Lifestyle Club LSC was fined \u00a322,299 and its director Tiina Lehtla separately fined \u00a37,983.33 in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/apr/07/rogue-agencies-council-crackdown-unlicensed-multiple-occupation\" title=\"\">a court case</a> brought by neighbouring Camden Council.</p> <p>The company was found guilty of ignoring a statutory requirement to supply the council with details of the property management and the tenancy contracts for two unlicensed, unsafe multi-occupancy homes in London.</p> <p>In his summing up, the judge accused the defendants of putting safety at risk to maximise revenue. \u201cThey did not apply for licences in the hope of avoiding an inspection, which would have resulted in expense to bring the properties up to standard,\u201d he said. \u201cThe tenants were from abroad and the most in need. They were given \u2018membership\u2019 agreements instead of tenancy agreements in an attempt to curtail their rights.</p> <p>\u201cThe obstruction of the local authority, by not returning the statutory notices, was deliberate, and a commercial decision to try and frustrate the investigation by environmental health officers.\u201d</p> <p>Lifestyle Club Ltd went into voluntary liquidation in February and Lifestyle Club LSC faces being struck off the Companies House register.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A lettings agency that posed as a membership club to dodge tenancy laws has been fined more than \u00a340,000 in the first prosecution of its kind in the UK. Lifestyle Club Ltd pressured tenants to sign a contract without inspecting the terms or the accommodation, charged them a non-refundable \u201cjoining\u201d fee and \u201cmembership\u201d fee worth a month\u2019s rent instead of a deposit, and directed those who complained to a non-existent redress service. The company operated from the same trading address as Lifestyle Club LSC Ltd which was exposed by the Observer last year. While Lifestyle Club LSC marketed the properties \u2013 aimed at young overseas renters \u2013 tenants\u2019 contracts were with Lifestyle Club Ltd. The terms and conditions reserved the right to evict tenants with seven days\u2019 notice instead of the 28-84 days required by the Tenancy Act. Its terms and conditions allowed its agents the right to enter private rooms unannounced at any time while banning visits from non-members. It required tenants to maintain and replace appliances at their own expense, leave any furniture they had paid for when they moved out and levied large fees for \u201cbreaches\u201d of membership. One group of flat sharers was charged \u00a390 for leaving unwashed dishes in the sink. The companies\u2019 self-employed agents were charged similar levies for breaching sales targets or taking time off. Last week the director of Lifestyle Club Ltd, Gian Paolo Aliatis, was required to pay \u00a342,273 in fines, compensation and costs after pleading guilty to three charges of unfair commercial practice. In a prosecution brought by Islington Trading Standards in London, Aliatis admitted passing the lettings agency off as a membership club to avoid the legal regulations for lettings agents. Under the law, tenants\u2019 deposits must be refundable and paid into a tenancy deposit protection scheme. Aliatis admitted that his firm demanded a non-refundable \u201cjoining\u201d fee. He also admitted pressuring customers into signing a \u201cmembership agreement\u201d without giving them time to read and understand the document, and denying potential tenants the chance to view a property before signing. Rental payments were passed off as a \u201cmonthly contribution fee\u201d. While letting agents are required by law to belong to a registered redress scheme, Lifestyle Club Ltd instead directed anyone who raised a complaint to a fake independent mediation company. Diarmaid Ward, Islington Council\u2019s executive member for housing and development, said: \u201cThis is a major victory for private tenants, not just in Islington but right across the country. Our determined trading standards team has led to a landmark prosecution sending a clear message \u2013 simply changing a few words in the paperwork does not put you above the law.\u201d In March, Lifestyle Club LSC was fined \u00a322,299 and its director Tiina Lehtla separately fined \u00a37,983.33 in a court case brought by neighbouring Camden Council. The company was found guilty of ignoring a statutory requirement to supply the council with details of the property management and the tenancy contracts for two unlicensed, unsafe multi-occupancy homes in London. In his summing up, the judge accused the defendants of putting safety at risk to maximise revenue. \u201cThey did not apply for licences in the hope of avoiding an inspection, which would have resulted in expense to bring the properties up to standard,\u201d he said. \u201cThe tenants were from abroad and the most in need. They were given \u2018membership\u2019 agreements instead of tenancy agreements in an attempt to curtail their rights. \u201cThe obstruction of the local authority, by not returning the statutory notices, was deliberate, and a commercial decision to try and frustrate the investigation by environmental health officers.\u201d Lifestyle Club Ltd went into voluntary liquidation in February and Lifestyle Club LSC faces being struck off the Companies House register.",

      "bodyText": "Finland has pledged to pursue a hearing into alleged breaches of the rule of law by Hungary\u2019s far-right government after a campaign of vilification led by the prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n. Orb\u00e1n and his spokesman, Zolt\u00e1n Kov\u00e1cs, have launched a series of attacks in recent weeks ranging from criticism of the level of domestic violence in Finland to the purchase of strategically important Finnish islands by Russian oligarchs. As the member state holding the EU\u2019s rolling presidency until the new year, the Finnish government is responsible for chairing meetings of the member states and pushing forward the bloc\u2019s agenda. The European parliament took the unprecedented step last September of asking member states to determine whether Hungary had breached the bloc\u2019s founding values in its overhaul of the country\u2019s judiciary and alleged failure to respect freedom of expression, religion and equal treatment under the law. In the most recent broadside, Kov\u00e1cs, who is Hungary\u2019s secretary of state for international communication and relations, wrote that Finland \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a constitutional court, independent judiciary or press freedom, it also shows signs of other serious problems as well\u201d. He raised the \u201cpetrifying\u201d numbers of women undergoing female genital mutilation and the \u201cgrave threat\u201d facing \u201cfreshly settled religious minorities\u201d. The Economist\u2019s annual democracy index ranks Finland as having among the most democratic systems in the world. When its government assumed the presidency on 1 July it said it would respect the parliament\u2019s vote in favour of pursuing the so-called article 7 process, under which Hungary could theoretically face the \u201cnuclear\u201d sanction of having its voting rights in EU institutions suspended. On the eve of the vote, Orb\u00e1n had told MEPs that his country was being targeted for choosing not to be \u201ca country of migrants\u201d and dismissed charges of corruption. His spokesman\u2019s article last month was in part a response to a defence of Finland\u2019s duty to pursue the issue by Petri Tuomi-Nikula, a former Finnish ambassador to Hungary, who had written that the country was \u201cone of the most corrupt \u2026 in the union\u201d. A spokesman for the Finnish government said the latest developments would not prevent it from \u201ctaking forward the ongoing procedures concerning the rule of law as appropriate\u201d. The spokesman said: \u201cThe article 7 procedure has been triggered, in the case of Hungary, by the European parliament. The treaty indicates that the next step will be a hearing in the council of the country concerned. \u201cThe Finnish presidency believes Hungary has the right to be heard and that it is also in its best interest.\u201d The spokesman said the parliament had voted \u201cnearly a year ago, so we think it is high time to move to the hearings. For some time already, a large number of member states have been demanding that hearings should begin. \u201cThe article 7 procedure should not be seen as a process directed against a particular member state. The rule of law is part of our shared value basis and something that unites us all. We believe we must cherish it. The Finnish presidency intends to promote rule of law issues through a positive and constructive approach.\u201d Fabian Zuleeg, from the European Policy Centre, a Brussels thinktank said the stakes for Orb\u00e1n over the rule of law would be greater if France successfully argued that EU funding should be linked to respect for the bloc\u2019s treaties. \u201cA greater focus on rule of law was always going to produce a counter reaction by Hungary, which under Orb\u00e1n has always argued that its democracy is as good as anywhere else in Europe, and that any comments or actions reflect different political ideologies,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the real political fight is still to come when the EU gets into the final phase of agreeing the next multi-annual financial framework.

      "bodyText": "Clean-up workers have begun a huge \u201cdecontamination\u201d operation around Notre Dame Cathedral after a health scare over lead particles from the fire. It is the second attempt to remove hazardous dust spread across a swath of central Paris that settled on homes, schools and on the ground after the blaze in April that destroyed the cathedral\u2019s roof and spire. Police sealed off the area around the cathedral to vehicles and pedestrians on Tuesday morning as the 10-day clean-up began. The nearby suburban train station has been closed and buses diverted. Decontamination teams will use \u201cultra high pressure\u201d water hoses filled with a chemical detergent or gel which will then be vacuumed up, taking the lead with it, officials hope. Experts say 400 tons of lead from the roof and spire burned during the blaze that engulfed the cathedral, threatening the collapse of the entire edifice. The regional prefect said work on consolidating the damaged building \u2013 halted over health concerns for site workers \u2013 would begin again next week. \u201cOur priority is to foresee any risk that could affect employees working on the site,\u201d Michel Cadot, the prefect, said in a statement. Several schools and creches in the area are being decontaminated before term starts in September and 162 local schoolchildren have been tested for lead levels \u2013 16 were found to have levels that need monitoring and one child was found to have a worryingly high level, but officials said it was unclear if this was linked to Notre Dame or his home. In May, police and officials said the air around Notre Dame was not toxic. Last week, Annie Th\u00e9baud-Mony, research director at Inserm (National Institute for Health and Medical Research), said the lead contamination was worrying. \u201cWe have to realise that the 400 tons of lead that were spread corresponds to four times the lead emissions in the whole of France for a year,\u201d she said. \u201cLead is as bad as asbestos in terms of poison.

But there\u2019s also no reason to doubt his sincerity. Instead of writing for <a href=\"http://www.pitt.edu/~emk4/comp1/slick.html\">a slick</a>, he wrote for himself, knuckling down in the early summer of 1938, giving himself a 100-day deadline to write the novel that would provide that tag of shame. He wrote in a lined ledger at the rate of 10,000 words a week. He told a friend that he had never worked so hard \u2013 and intended to rip his \u201creader\u2019s nerves to rags\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/15/robert-mcrum-100-best-novels-observer-steinbeck-grapes-wrath\">The 100 best novels: No 65 \u2013  The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck (1939)</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He also shredded his own. \u201cThis must be a good book, it simply must. I haven\u2019t any choice,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.themorgan.org/exhibitions/online/TheDiary/podcast\">he confided in the diary he kept while writing</a>. \u201cFor the first time I\u2019m working on a real book that is not limited \u2026 It will take every bit of experience and thought and feeling that I have.\u201d</p> <p>The entries became increasingly fraught. \u201cI hope I\u2019m not heading for a nervous breakdown,\u201d he wrote. And then: \u201cMy nerves are going fast \u2026 I wish I could go to a furnished room some place where I know no one and just disappear for a while. I wish that.\u201d And then: \u201cI\u2019m afraid this book is going to pieces. If it does, I do too.\u201d</p> <p>On 26 October 1938, he wrote: \u201cI am so dizzy I can hardly see the page.\u201d Mercifully, later on that same day, he added: \u201cFinished \u2026 and I hope to God it\u2019s good.\u201d</p> <p>This furious effort has since passed into legend; not least because the urgency Steinbeck dedicated to his craft is so clearly replicated in the sincerity and passion of The Grapes of Wrath. But like plenty of legends, it doesn\u2019t tell the whole truth: Steinbeck backed up his burst of creativity with a period of careful and calmer editing. And even though the book was written in a rapid fury, it had had a long genesis.</p> <p>As that letter to his agent implies, Steinbeck had known about the sufferings of migrant workers for years. In 1936, he wrote a less famous novel called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/02/in-dubious-battle-review-james-franco-hobbled-by-john-steinbeck\">In Dubious Battle</a>, inspired by the California agricultural strikes that had been going since 1933. His home town, Salinas, was also the site of a camp for workers in the nearby fields. In a case of life mirroring art, in September 1936 a pitched battle broke out there between the workers and, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/21/melvyn-bragg-on-john-steinbeck\">as Melvyn Bragg describes them</a>, \u201cthe forces of agribusiness (stiffened by 250 proto-fascist American Legionnaires and 2,000 local vigilantes)\u201d.</p> <p>This event, in turn, helped Steinbeck win the commission to write a series of articles for the San Francisco News titled <a href=\"https://missthedogatemyhomework.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/john-steinbeck-the-harvest-gypsies.pdf\">The Harvest Gypsies</a> \u2013 and so took him still deeper into that world. He visited <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weedpatch_Camp\">Weedpatch Camp,</a> which eventually featured in The Grapes of Wrath. As well as speaking to people there, he was <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2008/winter/grapes.html\">given vital research materials by the camp\u2019s manager, Tom Collins</a>. Many of these documents were custom built for a novelist, having been given to Collins by Sanora Babb, who was planning her own book about the migrants. (<a href=\"http://broadstreetonline.org/2015/02/the-wrath-of-upstaging/\">In a cruel twist,</a> Babb\u2019s book was pulled from publication because her publisher feared it would get no attention after the success of The Grapes of Wrath.)</p> <p>In the first piece for the San Francisco News, Steinbeck describes the plight of families fleeing the Dust Bowl, who, \u201carrive in California usually having used up every resource to get here, even to the selling of the poor blankets and utensils and tools on the way to buy gasoline. They arrive bewildered and beaten and usually in a state of semi-starvation, with only one necessity to face immediately, and that is to find work at any wage in order that the family may eat.\u201d</p> <p>He described people who had lost their homes, their livelihoods, their sense of worth. \u201cDignity is all gone,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand spirit has turned to sullen anger before it dies.\u201d He spoke to people who had lost loved ones, and women whose children had died because they were unable to produce the milk to feed them. One passage describes a toddler, belly swollen with malnutrition, beset by flies that \u201ctry to get at the mucus in the eye-corners. This child seems to have the reactions of a baby much younger. The first year he had a little milk, but he has had none since. He will die in a very short time.\u201d</p> <p>In The Harvest Gypsies articles, Steinbeck wrote in direct, matter-of-fact journalese. You can almost sense him holding himself in; it would have been surprising if Steinbeck hadn\u2019t gone on his furious subsequent writing binge. But it still feels fortunate for us that he did \u2013 even if he was initially disappointed. Soon after he finished writing, Steinbeck declared: \u201cIt isn\u2019t the great book I had hoped it would be. It\u2019s just a run-of-the-mill book.\u201d A year later, it won the Pulitzer prize. Eighty years on, it\u2019s sold more than 14m copies.</p>",

He also shredded his own. \u201cThis must be a good book, it simply must. I haven\u2019t any choice,\u201d he confided in the diary he kept while writing. \u201cFor the first time I\u2019m working on a real book that is not limited \u2026 It will take every bit of experience and thought and feeling that I have.\u201d The entries became increasingly fraught. \u201cI hope I\u2019m not heading for a nervous breakdown,\u201d he wrote. And then: \u201cMy nerves are going fast \u2026 I wish I could go to a furnished room some place where I know no one and just disappear for a while. I wish that.\u201d And then: \u201cI\u2019m afraid this book is going to pieces. If it does, I do too.\u201d On 26 October 1938, he wrote: \u201cI am so dizzy I can hardly see the page.\u201d Mercifully, later on that same day, he added: \u201cFinished \u2026 and I hope to God it\u2019s good.\u201d This furious effort has since passed into legend; not least because the urgency Steinbeck dedicated to his craft is so clearly replicated in the sincerity and passion of The Grapes of Wrath. But like plenty of legends, it doesn\u2019t tell the whole truth: Steinbeck backed up his burst of creativity with a period of careful and calmer editing. And even though the book was written in a rapid fury, it had had a long genesis. As that letter to his agent implies, Steinbeck had known about the sufferings of migrant workers for years. In 1936, he wrote a less famous novel called In Dubious Battle, inspired by the California agricultural strikes that had been going since 1933. His home town, Salinas, was also the site of a camp for workers in the nearby fields. In a case of life mirroring art, in September 1936 a pitched battle broke out there between the workers and, as Melvyn Bragg describes them, \u201cthe forces of agribusiness (stiffened by 250 proto-fascist American Legionnaires and 2,000 local vigilantes)\u201d. This event, in turn, helped Steinbeck win the commission to write a series of articles for the San Francisco News titled The Harvest Gypsies \u2013 and so took him still deeper into that world. He visited Weedpatch Camp, which eventually featured in The Grapes of Wrath. As well as speaking to people there, he was given vital research materials by the camp\u2019s manager, Tom Collins. Many of these documents were custom built for a novelist, having been given to Collins by Sanora Babb, who was planning her own book about the migrants. (In a cruel twist, Babb\u2019s book was pulled from publication because her publisher feared it would get no attention after the success of The Grapes of Wrath.) In the first piece for the San Francisco News, Steinbeck describes the plight of families fleeing the Dust Bowl, who, \u201carrive in California usually having used up every resource to get here, even to the selling of the poor blankets and utensils and tools on the way to buy gasoline. They arrive bewildered and beaten and usually in a state of semi-starvation, with only one necessity to face immediately, and that is to find work at any wage in order that the family may eat.\u201d He described people who had lost their homes, their livelihoods, their sense of worth. \u201cDignity is all gone,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand spirit has turned to sullen anger before it dies.\u201d He spoke to people who had lost loved ones, and women whose children had died because they were unable to produce the milk to feed them. One passage describes a toddler, belly swollen with malnutrition, beset by flies that \u201ctry to get at the mucus in the eye-corners. This child seems to have the reactions of a baby much younger. The first year he had a little milk, but he has had none since. He will die in a very short time.\u201d In The Harvest Gypsies articles, Steinbeck wrote in direct, matter-of-fact journalese. You can almost sense him holding himself in; it would have been surprising if Steinbeck hadn\u2019t gone on his furious subsequent writing binge. But it still feels fortunate for us that he did \u2013 even if he was initially disappointed. Soon after he finished writing, Steinbeck declared: \u201cIt isn\u2019t the great book I had hoped it would be. It\u2019s just a run-of-the-mill book.\u201d A year later, it won the Pulitzer prize. Eighty years on, it\u2019s sold more than 14m copies.",

      "bodyText": "A man who allegedly stabbed a woman to death in Sydney\u2019s central business district before attacking others on a busy city street with a butcher\u2019s knife was arrested carrying information about terrorist attacks and extremist ideologies on a USB drive. But police say the man did not have any known links to terror groups, and that he acted alone. The attacks are not being treated as a terrorist attack, the New South Wales police commissioner, Mick Fuller, said on Tuesday night. The 20-year-old man from Marayong, near Blacktown in western Sydney, jumped on cars and yelled at bystanders to \u201cshoot me in the fucking head\u201d before being restrained by members of the public \u2013 later lauded as \u201cheroes\u201d by police \u2013 who used cafe chairs and a milk crate to pin him down. About an hour after the man\u2019s arrest, the body of a 24-year-old woman was found inside an apartment in Clarence Street, in central Sydney. It is understood she had suffered multiple stab wounds. Police say the man was arrested carrying a USB drive containing documents espousing \u201cterrorist ideologies\u201d and detailing mass casualty crimes, including recent attacks in North America and New Zealand, but he did not have any known links to terror groups, and acted alone. The man has a history of mental health problems. It has been reported that he had escaped from a mental health facility in recent days, but this has not been confirmed. \u201cHis history is unremarkable compared the gravity of his crimes,\u201d Fuller said. He said the man was known to police in relation to his history of mental health conditions, not because of any links to terror groups. The man\u2019s offending first came to public light when he was seen running amok through Clarence Street. Fuller described it as six minutes of \u201cterrifying carnage\u201d. A 41-year-old woman was stabbed in the back in the Hotel CBD, on the corner of Clarence and York streets. She was taken to St Vincent\u2019s hospital suffering a non-life threatening injury from a single stab wound to her back. There were no other injuries after the man appeared to attack passersby at random with a butcher\u2019s knife. The alleged offender, also suffering injuries, was taken to hospital, but was expected to be transferred to a police station overnight and charged, likely with murder and serious assault charges. \u201cIf it becomes a terrorist incident\u2026 obviously there will be other charges in relation to that\u2026 it\u2019s an evolving investigation,\u201d Fuller said. Footage of the man\u2019s rampage showed him running across a city intersection, his clothes apparently stained with blood. At one point he climbs on the roof of a car, yelling, as a man carrying a cafe chair seeks to corral him. Further footage shows members of the public restraining the man near Wynyard station, holding him down by using chairs across his body and a milk crate over his head. Some members of the public abuse the man and attempt to assault him, while others urge people to \u201cwait for the cops\u201d. Superintendent Gavin Wood of NSW police said the bystanders who apprehended the men were \u201csignificantly brave people\u201d. \u201cTo approach a person with a mindset of obviously what this person [had], with clear evidence of a stabbing previously, these people are heroes.\u201d He said their actions had prevented others from being hurt. \u201cThese members of the public, going about their day-to-day business, have jumped into a situation which was extremely dangerous and hostile and they have brought a person, who we will be alleging has stabbed an innocent person for no specific reason, into custody and allowed us to do our job.\u201d Wood said it had been reported to him that the man had yelled \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d; he said this had not been captured as part of the \u201cevidentiary base\u201d but would form part of the investigation. Footage posted online of the man yelling reveals an indistinct pronunciation, suggesting he was not an Arabic speaker, nor familiar with the phrase. The driver of the car on which the man climbed said he had appeared suddenly on the street, covered in blood and brandishing a butcher\u2019s knife. \u201cHe was fearless, he was completely fearless.

      "body": "<p>It won a Moli\u00e8re award in its native France \u2013 although a Jacques Tati award might have been more appropriate. Fishbowl is a wordless comedy about three neighbours living at the top of a Parisian apartment block. We see their cramped quarters and the rooftop overhead. We watch as they defend their independence from one another then abandon it, fall in love, party, piss each other off and steal each other\u2019s biscuits. Laura L\u00e9onard\u2019s set is a box of tricks and the three performers rival it with unexpected dexterity.</p> \n<p>For most of its 75 minutes, you don\u2019t feel you\u2019re watching a story. It\u2019s more like a montage of domestic incidents as this trio lead their cheek-by-jowl lives. One tenant spills bleach into her goldfish bowl, triggering a chaotic chain reaction across the three flats; there\u2019s the day she goes sunbathing on the roof, casting her birdwatching neighbour as a peeping Tom; and the night of the communal knees-up, with comedy dancing in the corridor and love rivalry punctuated by frequent visits to the shared loo.</p> \n<p>The pleasure in Pierre Guillois\u2019s production is in large part about special effects and comic choreography, as wigs are whipped away by the wind, burst pipes extinguish pan fires on the other side of the room, and \u2013 nice running joke, this \u2013 a hi-tech toilet is activated (intentionally or otherwise) by handclap. The performances are endearing, too, although harder to read if you\u2019re not in the front rows of the vast Pleasance Grand.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom

      "bodyText": "It won a Moli\u00e8re award in its native France \u2013 although a Jacques Tati award might have been more appropriate. Fishbowl is a wordless comedy about three neighbours living at the top of a Parisian apartment block. We see their cramped quarters and the rooftop overhead. We watch as they defend their independence from one another then abandon it, fall in love, party, piss each other off and steal each other\u2019s biscuits. Laura L\u00e9onard\u2019s set is a box of tricks and the three performers rival it with unexpected dexterity. For most of its 75 minutes, you don\u2019t feel you\u2019re watching a story. It\u2019s more like a montage of domestic incidents as this trio lead their cheek-by-jowl lives. One tenant spills bleach into her goldfish bowl, triggering a chaotic chain reaction across the three flats; there\u2019s the day she goes sunbathing on the roof, casting her birdwatching neighbour as a peeping Tom; and the night of the communal knees-up, with comedy dancing in the corridor and love rivalry punctuated by frequent visits to the shared loo. The pleasure in Pierre Guillois\u2019s production is in large part about special effects and comic choreography, as wigs are whipped away by the wind, burst pipes extinguish pan fires on the other side of the room, and \u2013 nice running joke, this \u2013 a hi-tech toilet is activated (intentionally or otherwise) by handclap. The performances are endearing, too, although harder to read if you\u2019re not in the front rows of the vast Pleasance Grand. It\u2019s only latterly that anything resembling a plot \u2013 or point \u2013 takes shape, as one among the trio bursts the bubble, breaking free to a life elsewhere. Retroactively, the show is revealed as a ships-passing moment in these people\u2019s lives; the time when they were everything to one another without realising it \u2013 or that it would end. In that light, the penultimate scene comes as a surprise, before raising the stakes and delivering a satisfying finale. The last scene is unnecessary, adding little to this timeless silent comedy about the farce and forced intimacies of crowded urban living. \u2022 At Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 26 Aug. \u2022 Read all our Edinburgh festival reviews.",

This has been something on our radar for years. We\u2019re all really curious why it\u2019s happening now.\u201d</p> <p>The raid came two days after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/10/jeffrey-epstein-dead-prison-report-latest\">the billionaire was found dead in a New York City jail cell,</a> having apparently killed himself. In the aftermath of his death, accusers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/11/jeffrey-epstein-death-accusers-demand-justice\">expressed anger</a> that Epstein would not face them in court. They sought reassurances that authorities would continue investigations into others who might have been involved in a trafficking ring that targeted young girls for sexual abuse.</p> <p>William Barr, the US attorney general, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2019/aug/12/trump-news-today-jeffrey-epstein-elections-2020-politics-latest\">said on Monday</a> that \u201cany co-conspirators should not rest easy. Victims deserve justice and will get it\u201d.</p> <p>Geoffrey S Berman, the Manhattan attorney, said in a statement: \u201cTo those brave young women who have already come forward and to the many others who have yet to do so, let me reiterate that we remain committed to standing for you, and our investigation of the conduct charged in the indictment \u2013 which included a conspiracy count \u2013 remains ongoing.\u201d</p> <p>David Weinstein, a white collar criminal defence lawyer with Hinshaw &amp; Culbertson and former federal prosecutor in Miami, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/12/jeffrey-epstein-investigation-latest-whats-next\">previously told the Guardian</a> Epstein\u2019s death could reduce potential issues with evidence.

All of that becomes fair game.\u201d</p> <p>Berman\u2019s case against Epstein for alleged sexual abuse of girls as young as 14 includes charges of sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy. The indictment alleges Epstein \u201cworked and conspired with others, including employees and associates who facilitated his conduct\u201d in luring girls to his Manhattan and Palm Beach homes between 2002 and 2005.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/12/business/jeffrey-epstein-interview.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage\">New York Times published an article</a> on Monday in which one of its writers, James B Stewart, recalled an interview he had conducted with Epstein in August last year. Stewart said Epstein had told him he knew details about the supposed sexual proclivities and recreational drug use of a number of rich and famous people.</p> <p>Epstein was also described as \u201cat ease\u201d when discussing his interest in young women.</p> <p>\u201cHe said that criminalising sex with teenage girls was a cultural aberration and that at times in history it was perfectly acceptable,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cHe pointed out that homosexuality had long been considered a crime and was still punishable by death in some parts of the world.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The FBI has raided Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s private island in the Caribbean, in a further sign the death of the financier will not halt scrutiny of his alleged sex trafficking crimes. Mobile phone footage broadcast by NBC news showed agents arriving on Little Saint James, in the US Virgin Islands, on Monday morning. Two senior law enforcement officials confirmed to NBC the FBI had begun a search directed by the Epstein taskforce, which is led by the US attorney\u2019s office for the southern district of New York. Kelly Quinn, who was running a sailing charter in the area, told NBC: \u201cWe were just trying to look at pretty fish and swim with turtles and here we are in the middle of an FBI raid. This has been something on our radar for years. We\u2019re all really curious why it\u2019s happening now.\u201d The raid came two days after the billionaire was found dead in a New York City jail cell, having apparently killed himself. In the aftermath of his death, accusers expressed anger that Epstein would not face them in court. They sought reassurances that authorities would continue investigations into others who might have been involved in a trafficking ring that targeted young girls for sexual abuse. William Barr, the US attorney general, said on Monday that \u201cany co-conspirators should not rest easy. Victims deserve justice and will get it\u201d. Geoffrey S Berman, the Manhattan attorney, said in a statement: \u201cTo those brave young women who have already come forward and to the many others who have yet to do so, let me reiterate that we remain committed to standing for you, and our investigation of the conduct charged in the indictment \u2013 which included a conspiracy count \u2013 remains ongoing.\u201d David Weinstein, a white collar criminal defence lawyer with Hinshaw &amp; Culbertson and former federal prosecutor in Miami, previously told the Guardian Epstein\u2019s death could reduce potential issues with evidence. This could explain the timing of the raid. \u201cThe evidence that they\u2019ve seized from him directly, the only person who can contest the seizure [as unlawful] could be Epstein or somebody who lived with him,\u201d Weinstein said. \u201cNow that he\u2019s dead, he can\u2019t challenge that. All of that becomes fair game.\u201d Berman\u2019s case against Epstein for alleged sexual abuse of girls as young as 14 includes charges of sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy. The indictment alleges Epstein \u201cworked and conspired with others, including employees and associates who facilitated his conduct\u201d in luring girls to his Manhattan and Palm Beach homes between 2002 and 2005. The New York Times published an article on Monday in which one of its writers, James B Stewart, recalled an interview he had conducted with Epstein in August last year. Stewart said Epstein had told him he knew details about the supposed sexual proclivities and recreational drug use of a number of rich and famous people. Epstein was also described as \u201cat ease\u201d when discussing his interest in young women. \u201cHe said that criminalising sex with teenage girls was a cultural aberration and that at times in history it was perfectly acceptable,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cHe pointed out that homosexuality had long been considered a crime and was still punishable by death in some parts of the world.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "About 2pm police received calls about a man wearing a balaclava and wielding a large butcher\u2019s knife in the vicinity of King Street. He shouted \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d and for police to \u201cfucking shoot me in the head\u201d. He has since been identified as a 20-year-old man from Marayong. The man stabbed a 41-year-old woman in the back in what appears to be a random attack. Three members of the public engaged and restrained the \u201cclearly dangerous\u201d man, using a chair and a milk crate, near Wynyard railway station. Emergency services and police responded and the man was arrested. Within the next 30 minutes police discovered the body of a 24-year-old woman in an apartment on Clarence Street. Police believe the two incidents are linked. The man was found with terrorist information on a USB drive about mass casualty crimes overseas, including in North America and New Zealand. He has no known links to terrorist organisations. Police said the man had a long history of mental health issues, and they were investigating reports he absconded from a mental health facility. He was known to police but \u201chis history was unremarkable compared to the of gravity of the crimes he committed\u201d, according to the New South Wales police commissioner, Mick Fuller. It\u2019s expected the man will be charged with homicide and serious assault, and potentially \u2013 if it becomes a terrorist incident \u2013 there will be charges relating to that. Here is our full story wrapping up today\u2019s events. ABC reports the 41-year-old woman who was stabbed this afternoon is recovering well, but unlikely to be discharged from hospital tonight. The Sydney Morning Herald has reported further details about the discovery of the 21-year-old woman, citing a bystander who said a young man came running to police to report hearing a woman screaming from inside the Clarence House apartments. There they struggled to enter the building. The officer and the young man tried to gain the attention of those inside by pressing on multiple apartment buzzers. Soon after a young woman came to the door, a mobile phone in one hand. Visibly distressed, the woman appealed to the officer: \u201cyou\u2019ve got to help me.\u201d Within 10 minutes police had established a new crime scene. Paul O\u2019Shaughnessy, 37, who played professionally for English football club Bury, and his brother Luke, 30, from Manchester, were in their office when they heard a disturbance. The brothers and two of their colleagues saw the alleged attacker wielding what Paul said was a knife and covered in blood, and chased him. He told the Guardian at the scene that, together with other onlookers, they had managed to subdue the alleged offender. Paul said the man had yelled \u201cextremist\u201d slogans, but he declined to repeat what he had said. \u201cWe just finished lunch ... We\u2019re just based on King Street and we have a window slightly open so we can hear noise and traffic and we heard a lot of shouting which was now obviously the attacker, and my brother opened the window even more and he said, \u2018Mate, there\u2019s a guy wielding a knife.\u2019\u201d Read more here. Those were the main points from Fuller, but the NSW police minister, David Elliott, also spoke. The city tonight, celebrates three brand-new heroes. And I think it would only be appropriate for the commissioner and I to thank those three individual citizens who have acted well and truly beyond the call of any citizen in bringing this offender to bear. Can I also congratulate those firefighters \u2026 who have also gone beyond the call of duty. I\u2019ll be making sure they get the appropriate accolades, and that everyone knows this is how Sydneysiders respond. It\u2019s expected the man will be charged with the homicide of a young woman in her 20s, and serious assault charges for the stabbing, and potentially \u2013 if it becomes a terrorist incident \u2013 there will be charges relating to that. Fuller is asked by a reporter about the incongruity of the man shouting \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d while having apparent white supremacy material on a thumb drive in his possession. \u201cDoes this seem to you the ramblings of a mentally ill man who absconded from a mental health facility a few days ago,\u201d the reporter asks. Fuller said at this point he would think the incident was a lone actor with mental health issues and no links to terrorism. \u201cIf I had to weigh it now, and I was forced to make a call, I would say the evidence all points to that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut... this is the infancy of the investigation.\u201d A third woman presented to a police station with her hand wrapped in a scarf but police said she was perhaps a witness, and not a victim. Anyone with information is urged to come forward and contact police. The arrested man had a history of mental health issues, police commissioner Fuller said, and they were investigating reports he had absconded from a mental health facility. \u201cI can say that he was known to police with but his history was unremarkable compared to the of gravity of the crimes he committed. I can say he does have a history of mental health, but at this stage, I can\u2019t expand on that. No doubt in the coming days, the investigation will be looked closely at, not just the last couple of days, but certainly the last probably six months to 12 months. Police were looking at whether mental health and/or drug issues were a factor but \u201cat the end of the day it\u2019s a horrendous crime and he should pay for that\u201d. The man was \u201cby definition, at the moment, a lone actor\u201d. Information was found on him related to other crimes related to mass casualties around the world, police said. This included incidents in North America and New Zealand, he said. This suggested he has some ideologies relating to terrorism, but police said he has no links to terrorism or apparent links to terrorist organisations. From the NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller, who is with members of the NSW government for a press conference in Sydney: At around two this afternoon we received multiple phone calls about a 21-year-old man from Marayong, in the vicinity of King Street armed with a knife and wearing a balaclava. Over the next six minutes \u2026 there was terrifying carnage in that area. He stabbed a 41-year-old woman in the back \u2013 it appears to be a random attack. Three members of the public who can only be described as highest-order heroes, have engaged this 21-year-old man and have placed him essentially under arrest, even though he was brandishing a large butcher\u2019s knife and was clearly dangerous. A number of other emergency services were in the vicinity and responded shortly after, and police put this individual in custody. In the next 30 minutes an expanded crime scene unfortunately identified a 21-year-old woman \u2026 deceased. All the available information we have at hand would link these two crimes. Our counter-terrorist command immediately stood up and the joint CT team which includes police and state and fed agencies, have assessed all available info in relation to his crime and it is not currently classed as a terrorism based incident. Paul Walker, a Seven cameraman, was on the scene and followed the chase through the city, filming the arrest near the corner of Carrington and Wynyard streets. Walker said the man with the chair, whom he identified as a bank worker, had used the chair \u201clike a lion tamer\u201d, trying to turn the man around as he ran through the city streets. He said firefighters were trying to move behind him. It was a case of people who didn\u2019t know each other coming together trying to deal with the situation, he said. They had moved through the city streets and the firefighters were calling out to people to run away, Walker said. \u201cOne guy wanted to kill him, but the firies tried to settle him down. Once he was in a position that was compliant everyone was just trying to work out why.\u201d Nine and Seven News have both reported the name of the man arrested today. The NSW police commissioner will be addressing the media in about 30 minutes, and I\u2019ll bring you the updates from that press conference. An Uber driver said he had just picked up an elderly couple from Crown Casino when he saw traffic had stopped on King and Clarence, and people fleeing. \u201cAll of a sudden this guy appears with a knife in his hand, covered in blood on his shirt. Next thing, I thought I obviously can\u2019t go through all those cars and, as I\u2019m thinking about doing something, the guy jumps on the front of the car ... and gets up to the very top. I froze for a split second but then I thought I hope he\u2019s not covered in explosives or anything and I quickly accelerated and veered to my left on Clarence Street. Then I made a right turn to get back on to York Street and there he was again being chased near York and Clarence, by the police and the public, by firies, with chairs and everything they could get their hands on. I think I saw a couple of police officers, they didn\u2019t have tasers or anything but they had their guns drawn on him. He was fearless, he was completely fearless. He was on something, I don\u2019t know what he was on. It was a scary moment, I\u2019m sure for a lot of people in Sydney. We posted this earlier, but here again is the footage of the incident this driver is speaking about. This is an evolving story, but here\u2019s what we know so far. Guardian Australia has confirmed the woman\u2019s death is linked to the stabbing incident. Her body was found inside the unit at 3.15 this afternoon, more than an hour after police received the first reports of a knife-wielding man trying to stab people outside in the street. Police have cordoned off the Clarence Street apartment building. Over the last half hour a number of people \u2013 apparently residents \u2013 have been escorted out by police. Many of them appeared shocked, and some where emotional. Police are due to address the media again in about an hour. Police are reassuring people inside the building that they\u2019re safe and to sit tight. Residents outside aren\u2019t being allowed back inside yet. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has responded to the incident, which he described as \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d. Guardian Australia reporter Michael McGowan is outside 118 Clarence Street, the apartment block where the woman\u2019s body was found. He said police had escorted a woman out of the building \u2013 she was not handcuffed \u2013 and she sat in the back of an unmarked police car. The body of a woman has been found at a unit on Clarence Street but police don\u2019t know if the death is connected to the stabbing. From NSW police: Inquiries are under way after the body of a woman was found inside a unit on Clarence Street, Sydney, about 3.15pm today. Officers from Sydney City police area command are on the scene and will conduct inquiries into whether the incident is linked to an earlier stabbing at a hotel on the corner of Clarence and King streets. Michael McGowan reports that police have left the press conference area and have gone to a crime scene on the north-east corner of Clarence and King. Traffic and public transport remains disrupted as officers continue their investigation across multiple crime scenes. The Clarence Street entrance of Wynyard station is closed, as is King Street between Clarence and York, and Clarence (northbound) between Market and King. Some buses are have diverted to nearby streets to pick up passengers. Paul O\u2019Shaughnessy and his brother Luke, from Manchester, were in their office on King Street when they heard a disturbance outside the building. The brothers and two of their colleagues saw the alleged attacker wielding what Paul said was knife and covered in blood, and chased him. He told media at the scene that, together with other onlookers, they managed to subdue the alleged offender. Paul said the man \u2013 whom he described as caucasian with curly hair \u2013 had yelled \u201cextremist\u201d slogans but declined to repeat what he had said. Wood said it had been reported to him that the man had yelled Allahu Akbar; this had not been captured as part of the \u201cevidentiary base\u201d but would form part of the investigation. (Some observers online have noted that the man\u2019s pronunciation suggested he wasn\u2019t familiar with the phrase.) Wood said he wanted to acknowledge the bravery of the bystanders who helped apprehend the suspect. \u201cThey were significantly brave people. To approach a person with a mind set of obviously what this person [had], with clear evidence of a stabbing previously, these people are heroes.\u201d He said their actions had prevented others from being hurt. \u201cThese members of the public, going about their day-to-day business, have jumped into a situation which was extremely dangerous and hostile and they have brought a person, who we will be alleging has stabbed an innocent person for no specific reason, into custody and allowed us to do our job.\u201d Superintendent Gavin Wood of NSW police confirmed there was one victim, a young woman who was stabbed in the back. Wood said there was nothing yet to suggest she was known to her attacker. There are no other injuries at this stage I can confirm. The offender has attempted to stab multiple people. Those attempts thankfully were unsuccessful. Again I will put on record we have a female person with a stab wound to the back currently being treated by paramedics and is en route to a Sydney hospital. NSW police have just held a press conference. They said the danger to the public was over, the man was acting alone and he was now in custody. \u201cThe threat to the community has been negated and I want to make that very, very clear,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are in the infancy stage of the stabbing investigation. There are a number of crime scenes. They are being thoroughly investigated by investigative and forensic staff as we speak and the investigation is ongoing.\u201d Photos clearly show the young man carrying a large kitchen knife. The photos are taken from inside a car on the corner of Clarence and King, and appear to line up with the footage published earlier showing the young man jumping on a car bonnet and yelling at bystanders. NSW police have confirmed one victim, a young woman who was stabbed in a nearby hotel. She has been taken to hospital in a stable condition. This, from NSW police: A short time later, members of the public detained the man before police attended and arrested him. He has since been taken to Day Street Police Station. Officers from Sydney City Police Area Command, and various specialist police, are conducting proactive patrols of the area, but it is believed there is no further threat to public safety. A number of crime scenes have been established and a number of road closures are in place, which is believed to have significant impact on traffic and public transport this afternoon. Members of the public are urged to avoid the area. Guardian Australia\u2019s Michael McGowan is at the scene. He writes: Police have King Street closed between the corner of York and Clarence streets. Police are saying the Hotel CBD is a crime scene, and have closed it while patrons are still inside. Ambulance, police and fire rescue crews are on site, and there are a lot of onlookers at the scene. There are multiple reports from apparent witnesses of stabbings. Police are yet to confirm any injuries, but we will bring updates as they come. Dramatic footage shows the young man walking across a city street, waving a knife and jumping on to the bonnet of a car. The vehicle drives forward and he rolls off the back before walking away, chased by members of the public. He screams: \u201cShoot me, fucking shoot me in the fucking head, shoot me, I want to fucking die.\u201d In separate footage members of the public and firefighters restrain him on the ground with cafe chairs and milk crates. He is clearly a young man, and has blood on his hands and shirt. Another man appears to run in and kick him, yelling: \u201cDo you know how many people you just stabbed?\u201d He tells others around them that the assailant had stabbed a woman, and then swallowed a bottle of pills. Note, these claims can\u2019t be independently verified at this point. An Uber driver, Leon, told 2GB that a shirtless man covered in blood and carrying a knife, had leapt across the bonnet of his car on Clarence Street. The man was being chased by police and firefighters, he said. The man appeared to be aged 23 to 24 and looked like he was \u201con something\u201d. Another caller, Tom, said he had just finished a meeting when he saw a man with a knife being tackled to the ground and detained by police. A man has been arrested in Sydney in a major police operation responding to reports of a man armed with a machete running at members of the public. New South Wales ambulance services said no patients were being treated for stab wounds. NSW police said they could not confirm any injuries but an operation was still under way and they asked members of the public to stay clear of the area. Police and emergency services are attending an incident in the Sydney CBD, on the corner of Clarence and King streets, in response to reports of an armed man. More to come.",

      "body": "<p>Journalistic etiquette decrees that any delicate questions are usually saved until near the end of an interview. That doesn\u2019t apply, however, when you are talking to a man who has written a standup show about his penis \u2013 or, rather, the piece of it that was stolen from him as a baby. Tom Rosenthal, the 31-year-old star of the sitcoms <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/jun/21/friday-night-dinner-tv-review\" title=\"\">Friday Night Dinner</a> (about the embarrassments of a Jewish family) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/sep/20/plebs-roman-comedy-tom-rosenthal\" title=\"\">Plebs</a> (anachronisms and dick jokes in ancient Rome), meets me at his agent\u2019s office and cuts to the chase. \u201cEver since I became aware of what had happened to me, I\u2019ve never felt so sure that something is wrong.\u201d The earnest tone signals that any jokes on the subject will be confined to the stage. \u201cI just don\u2019t think it\u2019s very funny.\u201d</p> \n<p>Fortunately, the show is. Manhood traces Rosenthal\u2019s gradual realisation that he didn\u2019t want to belong to a club that would have a member like his as a member. First, there was the \u201clittle sleeve\u201d he noticed on a classmate\u2019s penis. Then came the terrifying circumcision video shown at his school when he was 12, which led to a confrontation at home. \u201cI had a shouting match with my mother. She took me to a doctor who basically invalidated all my feelings. The truth is that my parents were put in charge of my welfare and they did something to me that can never be remedied.\u201d</p> \n<p>This is all some way from Richard Herring\u2019s hit show Talking Cock, which scrutinised attitudes towards male genitalia but kept the knob gags coming. Although Rosenthal\u2019s set is hilarious, it is also candid, angry and often painful. An earlier version was \u201ca bit too much like a Ted Talk\u201d, with the balance tipped in favour of some formidable and wide-ranging research. Only once he started emphasising that he had skin in the game, so to speak, as well as interrogating the justifications for circumcision, did he locate the show\u2019s real power.</p> \n<p>Nothing is off limits in Manhood, whether it is the adverse effect circumcision has had on Rosenthal\u2019s sexual performance or its relationship to his OCD. The details extend even to a discussion of his father\u2019s genitalia. Yes, that is the penis of Jim Rosenthal, the sports presenter named by the creators of Alan Partridge as an inspiration for their gauche and gaffe-prone Norfolk-based broadcaster. Rosenthal Jr has already mined that area in his 2011 fringe debut, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/aug/14/tom-rosenthal-comedy-interview\" title=\"\">Child of Privilege</a>, where he discussed his father\u2019s failed attempt to sue Heston Blumenthal over a food poisoning incident.</p> \n<p>\u201cMy dad liked the idea that I was taking the piss out of him,\u201d he says. \u201cOf course, discussing his penis is slightly more intimate.\u201d One of the reasons Rosenthal was given for his own circumcision was that \u201ca boy\u2019s penis should look like his father\u2019s\u201d. I had assumed Rosenthal Sr was circumcised for religious reasons, but his son, who has got a lot of comic mileage out of being mistaken for a Jew, sets me straight. \u201cThe last proper Jew in our family was four generations back. My dad was circumcised for medical reasons, which is another bloody rabbit hole because a lot of those cases are misdiagnosed.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom

But if you don\u2019t feel fine, which I don\u2019t, then you\u2019re justified.\u201d It would be nice also if the audience laughs. \u201cYeah!

      "bodyText": "Journalistic etiquette decrees that any delicate questions are usually saved until near the end of an interview. That doesn\u2019t apply, however, when you are talking to a man who has written a standup show about his penis \u2013 or, rather, the piece of it that was stolen from him as a baby. Tom Rosenthal, the 31-year-old star of the sitcoms Friday Night Dinner (about the embarrassments of a Jewish family) and Plebs (anachronisms and dick jokes in ancient Rome), meets me at his agent\u2019s office and cuts to the chase. \u201cEver since I became aware of what had happened to me, I\u2019ve never felt so sure that something is wrong.\u201d The earnest tone signals that any jokes on the subject will be confined to the stage. \u201cI just don\u2019t think it\u2019s very funny.\u201d Fortunately, the show is. Manhood traces Rosenthal\u2019s gradual realisation that he didn\u2019t want to belong to a club that would have a member like his as a member. First, there was the \u201clittle sleeve\u201d he noticed on a classmate\u2019s penis. Then came the terrifying circumcision video shown at his school when he was 12, which led to a confrontation at home. \u201cI had a shouting match with my mother. She took me to a doctor who basically invalidated all my feelings. The truth is that my parents were put in charge of my welfare and they did something to me that can never be remedied.\u201d This is all some way from Richard Herring\u2019s hit show Talking Cock, which scrutinised attitudes towards male genitalia but kept the knob gags coming. Although Rosenthal\u2019s set is hilarious, it is also candid, angry and often painful. An earlier version was \u201ca bit too much like a Ted Talk\u201d, with the balance tipped in favour of some formidable and wide-ranging research. Only once he started emphasising that he had skin in the game, so to speak, as well as interrogating the justifications for circumcision, did he locate the show\u2019s real power. Nothing is off limits in Manhood, whether it is the adverse effect circumcision has had on Rosenthal\u2019s sexual performance or its relationship to his OCD. The details extend even to a discussion of his father\u2019s genitalia. Yes, that is the penis of Jim Rosenthal, the sports presenter named by the creators of Alan Partridge as an inspiration for their gauche and gaffe-prone Norfolk-based broadcaster. Rosenthal Jr has already mined that area in his 2011 fringe debut, Child of Privilege, where he discussed his father\u2019s failed attempt to sue Heston Blumenthal over a food poisoning incident. \u201cMy dad liked the idea that I was taking the piss out of him,\u201d he says. \u201cOf course, discussing his penis is slightly more intimate.\u201d One of the reasons Rosenthal was given for his own circumcision was that \u201ca boy\u2019s penis should look like his father\u2019s\u201d. I had assumed Rosenthal Sr was circumcised for religious reasons, but his son, who has got a lot of comic mileage out of being mistaken for a Jew, sets me straight. \u201cThe last proper Jew in our family was four generations back. My dad was circumcised for medical reasons, which is another bloody rabbit hole because a lot of those cases are misdiagnosed.\u201d What is his father\u2019s attitude to the subject now? \u201cHe\u2019s very funny. And not in the way I\u2019d like him to be. He\u2019ll say: \u2018Doesn\u2019t sex feel good? My penis is fine!\u2019 He cares about the fact that I care. But he doesn\u2019t care for the reasons that I care about it.\u201d Rosenthal\u2019s parents will see the show in Edinburgh. \u201cDad said initially that he wouldn\u2019t. He thought it was a revenge show, a \u2018fuck you\u2019, and it isn\u2019t that at all.\u201d When I ask whether he can forgive his parents, he spits out a mirthless \u201cHa!\u201d then furrows his brow. \u201cThat\u2019s a really hard question.

But if you don\u2019t feel fine, which I don\u2019t, then you\u2019re justified.\u201d It would be nice also if the audience laughs. \u201cYeah! Someone obsessed with their dick should be funny, regardless of the cultural ramifications.\u201d Manhood is at Edinburgh Pleasance Two until 25 August, then touring",

      "bodyText": "A Scottish judge has fast-tracked a legal challenge backed by 75 MPs and peers to prevent Boris Johnson proroguing parliament to force through a no-deal Brexit. The cross-party group, led by the Scottish National party MP Joanna Cherry QC, alleges it would be illegal and unconstitutional for the prime minister to suspend the Commons to prevent MPs blocking a no-deal Brexit before 31 October. They told Lord Doherty in the court of session \u201cthe petition raises legal issues of profound constitutional significance, and these require to be considered and determined as a matter of extreme urgency\u201d. Doherty ruled an urgent hearing of the case should take place on Friday 6 September, giving both sides only 10 days to prepare their legal arguments and four more days to revise them. The case has been brought by a cross-party group of Labour, SNP, Liberal Democrat and former Tory MPs who quit the party over Brexit, and the Good Law Project, the anti-Brexit campaign group set up by Jolyon Maugham QC. Another two MPs are due to join the group before the next hearing. It follows a historic victory for a cross-party group of Scottish parliamentarians and Maugham in the European court of justice last December, which said the UK was legally able to revoke article 50 without the EU\u2019s approval. In two minor victories for the UK government, Doherty refused the group\u2019s plea for the case to be immediately sent to Scottish appeal judges to speed the process up, and also accepted the government\u2019s compromise proposal for costs should be capped and shared between both sides. David Welsh, the advocate acting for the parliamentarians and Maugham, told the court they feared the government would block and slow down the case as much as possible. He said the applicants were running desperately short of time: in order for a final judgment on whether proroguing parliament was lawful before 31 October, the case needed to be heard by the ordinary court, the appeal court and finally the UK supreme court in only 11 weeks. Welsh warned that legal delays in reaching a final decision meant Johnson could prorogue parliament before the case had ended. A no-deal Brexit would have \u201csevere and irreversible\u201d consequences. \u201cIt is a rather exceptional request against a highly exceptional and unusual background,\u201d he added. Andrew Webster QC, the government\u2019s lawyer, denied that ministers wanted to obstruct the case and accused Welsh of \u201cmisreading and mischaracterising\u201d the government\u2019s view it would be wrong to immediately refer the case to the appeal court. Webster told Doherty the UK government also wanted it heard and decided before the UK\u2019s departure deadline. \u201cThe respondent is willing to seek to deal with these matters before 31 October provided that is done in a fair and proportionate manner,\u201d he said. He admitted this was a \u201cchallenging timetable\u201d but said allowing the main case in the lower court to be heard in five weeks, gave the appeal court and supreme court six weeks to finally decide. The case will hinge on whether Johnson would be breaching established constitutional law and both the EU Withdrawal Act 2018 and the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation etc) Act 2019 if he asked the Queen to prorogue parliament. The petition argues the EU Withdrawal Act requires parliament to ratify the final Brexit deal and the Northern Ireland act was amended by Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general, to ensure parliament sat from September to December 2019, and heard fortnightly reports by ministers, to scrutinise the Brexit process.",

It covers more than 200 hectares (494 acres) of heathland, grassland and woodland. Three trails run through the scenery, each a manageable 1<sup>1/2 </sup>miles, and kids can pick up a wildlife-challenge checklist from the information point at the start, then exchange it for a certificate at the end. The woodpecker and nuthatch trails loop past a hide where it\u2019s possible to watch birds feeding and the buzzard trail passes through an area that was once an iron-age hill fort. We walked this route, and the change in the landscape was incredible: from flat, open heathland cloaked in purple heather, to deep, thick woodland so gloriously overgrown that my children thought we were on a jungle expedition.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d0112589c72f4c77f3c8de4d21ca3588646f3b87\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d0112589c72f4c77f3c8de4d21ca3588646f3b87/0_261_6016_3608/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The writer\u2019s children do their wildlife-challenge checklist at RSPB The Lodge, Sandy, Bedfordshire, UK\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The writer\u2019s children do their wildlife-challenge checklist.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katie Gregory</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Fun fact</h2> <p>If following the woodpecker trail, listen out for the cackle of the green woodpecker laughing at you.

      "body": "<p>I\u2019ve never been very good with change. On all my birthdays my mum likes to drag up the story about how I cried when I turned five because I wanted to stay four forever and, honestly, I still relate. So when year 13 exams wrapped up and my time at school came to an end, I felt disorientated, as though I\u2019d fallen off the edge into nothingness.</p> <p>I had a university place confirmed but, confused about what I was committing to for three years, and struggling with my dyslexia, I was beginning to backtrack on my plans to study English. So this ended up being the summer I spent trying to decide whether to go or to apply again the following year. I was grateful that taking a year out was an option at all, but I also had absolutely no idea what I was going to do and felt as though I had failed. In the meantime, I got a job for the summer at a catering company, working for \u00a35.35 an hour. We had to buy our own uniforms, so the first couple of shifts were about breaking even.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Building up camaraderie was difficult over an eight-hour shift with someone you wouldn\u2019t meet again</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Unfortunately for me, the job was all about change. We were outsourced staff, with slicked buns, ironed shirts and straight-creased slacks, and we rotated around whatever party, wedding, concert or work event needed us. \u201cNo two shifts are the same!\u201d was part of the sell, but after a handful of jobs the phrase became what I\u2019d groan as I came through the door: \u201cNo two shifts are the same.\u201d Variety might be the spice of life, but this was a period in which things didn\u2019t need spicing up any more. I was feeling pretty insecure.</p> <p>At that age, everyone knew the sickest burn in any film to date came at the climax of Clueless, when Tai sneers at Cher through gritted teeth: \u201cYou\u2019re a virgin who can\u2019t drive.\u201d But that was a little close to home for me. I wasn\u2019t entirely happy about the way my personality had shaped up at 18. I\u2019d always been shy, and never felt I had the masterful handle on social interactions most of my friends seemed to understand instinctively.</p> <p>I bobbed through school, like most teenagers, keeping my head down and just trying to fit in, but under the surface I struggled socially. I filled multiple angsty diaries with how I\u2019d never had a boyfriend and never been kissed. For some reason, I also didn\u2019t gel well with those big crescendo Friday-night events: the WKD-in-the-park meetups, the house parties and, later, the clubbing. I wasn\u2019t self-assured like other people were, and that social clunkiness felt even heavier at work.</p> <p>How do other people conduct themselves so smoothly?

      "bodyText": "I\u2019ve never been very good with change. On all my birthdays my mum likes to drag up the story about how I cried when I turned five because I wanted to stay four forever and, honestly, I still relate. So when year 13 exams wrapped up and my time at school came to an end, I felt disorientated, as though I\u2019d fallen off the edge into nothingness. I had a university place confirmed but, confused about what I was committing to for three years, and struggling with my dyslexia, I was beginning to backtrack on my plans to study English. So this ended up being the summer I spent trying to decide whether to go or to apply again the following year. I was grateful that taking a year out was an option at all, but I also had absolutely no idea what I was going to do and felt as though I had failed. In the meantime, I got a job for the summer at a catering company, working for \u00a35.35 an hour. We had to buy our own uniforms, so the first couple of shifts were about breaking even. Unfortunately for me, the job was all about change. We were outsourced staff, with slicked buns, ironed shirts and straight-creased slacks, and we rotated around whatever party, wedding, concert or work event needed us. \u201cNo two shifts are the same!\u201d was part of the sell, but after a handful of jobs the phrase became what I\u2019d groan as I came through the door: \u201cNo two shifts are the same.\u201d Variety might be the spice of life, but this was a period in which things didn\u2019t need spicing up any more. I was feeling pretty insecure. At that age, everyone knew the sickest burn in any film to date came at the climax of Clueless, when Tai sneers at Cher through gritted teeth: \u201cYou\u2019re a virgin who can\u2019t drive.\u201d But that was a little close to home for me. I wasn\u2019t entirely happy about the way my personality had shaped up at 18. I\u2019d always been shy, and never felt I had the masterful handle on social interactions most of my friends seemed to understand instinctively. I bobbed through school, like most teenagers, keeping my head down and just trying to fit in, but under the surface I struggled socially. I filled multiple angsty diaries with how I\u2019d never had a boyfriend and never been kissed. For some reason, I also didn\u2019t gel well with those big crescendo Friday-night events: the WKD-in-the-park meetups, the house parties and, later, the clubbing. I wasn\u2019t self-assured like other people were, and that social clunkiness felt even heavier at work. How do other people conduct themselves so smoothly? One shift I\u2019d be bumbling over to a group of people at a work event, talking about \u201ccanopies\u201d instead of \u201ccanap\u00e9s\u201d, and the next, I\u2019d be saying \u201cthank you\u201d instead of \u201cyou\u2019re welcome\u201d as I handed over the wrong change for a poorly poured pint of Guinness. I felt incompetent, unconfident and generally useless. The varied nature of the job also meant things never felt like they were getting easier, because the rules, the customers, the teams, the bosses, the hours and the venues were constantly changing. It was flexible \u2013 which was why I\u2019d jumped ship from my retail job \u2013 but also sometimes lonely. There were moments where we bonded, though. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to pour out every last drop, to show you\u2019ve given him the full bottle,\u201d I remember being told with a whisper after a customer looked at me like I\u2019d just murdered someone. I\u2019d only poured about 90% of a mini bottle of wine into his glass \u2013 but I\u2019d only legally been able to drink for a few months and didn\u2019t fully understood that when it came to alcohol people were precious about portions.

Barr says Epstein \u2018co-conspirators should not rest easy\u2019 The investigation into the billionaire Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s alleged sex trafficking crimes is to continue despite his apparent suicide in jail, with the US attorney general, William Barr, warning any potential co-conspirators in the case that they \u201cshould not rest easy\u201d.

Brian Kateman says we should get used to a new kind of seafood. Opinion The women Jeffrey Epstein allegedly abused must continue to live with the trauma, while he has avoided a public reckoning for his crimes. His death is a victory for misogyny, says Moira Donegan. One reason that conspiracy theories have sprouted so prolifically in the wake of Epstein\u2019s death is because patriarchy operates with such ruthless efficiency in denying recompense to women victims of sexual abuse that it really can seem as if nefarious forces are plotting against women\u2019s rights in shadowy, smoke-filled rooms.

Unfortunately Brexit seems to have proven just as brain-meltingly toxic for the Greens as it has for every other party. Lucas, usually a canny parliamentary operator who can punch well above her weight, has inexplicably tied the party to an unworkable fantasy that only exists because hard remainers dislike Jeremy Corbyn more than they fear a no-deal Brexit. And that\u2019s without even getting into the fact that her fantasy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/11/cabinet-women-no-deal-brexit-caroline-lucas\" title=\"\">10-woman cabinet</a> did not include a single woman of colour.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>No national unity gubbins can get past the fact that all roads to stopping Brexit run through a Labour government</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It makes sense that centrists, having seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/19/centrism-isnt-the-solution-out-of-the-mess-were-in\" title=\"\">their ideology\u2019s reputation</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/17/centrists-attack-left-extremists-labour-moderates\" title=\"\">tank with the public</a>, have now decided that democracy is a luxury we can no longer afford. It\u2019s a mistake, though, to see Brexit as being caused by too much democracy. Instead it should be seen as the result of the UK\u2019s democratic deficit. This cannot be fixed by telling people to sit down and be quiet: proper accountability, not technocratic backroom deals, is what\u2019s needed if parliament is to regain its legitimacy after this mess.</p> <p>Ironically the argument \u201cwe just want to stop no deal\u201d comes after the hard-remain faction\u2019s longstanding accusal of Corbyn as being a crypto-leaver because Labour\u2019s policies reflected a compromise between the party\u2019s soft-leave and remain wings: exactly the alliance this temporary government is supposed to be unifying against the hardline no-dealers. It\u2019s impossible to say what might have happened if this broad anti-no deal arrangement had been sought in 2016, or if certain factions hadn\u2019t been so keen to use remain as an anti-Corbyn Trojan horse. Even now, despite the fact that they\u2019re trying to implement what basically amounts to Labour party policy, they are still throwing a tantrum over involving the Labour leader.</p> <p>Corbyn\u2019s personal beliefs on Brexit are presented as the obstacle to working with him, but this contradicts the omnipresence of Yvette Cooper in every Stop Brexit fantasy proposal. Cooper\u2019s position on Brexit is barely distinguishable from Corbyn\u2019s: if anything, she is more hardline on <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/yvette-cooper-labour-should-not-be-arguing-to-keep-free-movement-a7463261.html\" title=\"\">some issues</a>, like freedom of movement. It is difficult not to conclude that, even at the 11th hour, the problem is not Corbyn\u2019s beliefs but a resistance to him as prime minister, whatever the circumstances.</p> <p>That\u2019s why it makes no sense for Lucas to get involved in these shenanigans. There is much more alignment between Green party policy and the direction of Labour under Corbyn than there would be if the centrists succeeded in wresting back control of the party. The Greens don\u2019t need to wholeheartedly back Corbyn, and should still campaign against Labour where the parties are in disagreement. But they should recognise that as a minor party it does them much more good to work with those who agree broadly with their overall policy platform than to seek out narrow alliances with people who will jettison them as soon as they are no longer useful.</p> <p>Lucas wrote: \u201cPolitical tribalism would likely scupper any moves that are just about putting Jeremy Corbyn in charge\u201d \u2013 but despite his unpopularity among \u201cthe sensibles\u201d, Corbyn remains the leader of the opposition and commands sufficient support within his party to ensure any challenger is seen off. No national unity gubbins can get past the fact that all roads to stopping Brexit run through a Labour government. Whether you believe Corbyn is pro-Brexit or not, he is against no deal, unlike Johnson\u2019s cabinet.

      "bodyText": "I\u2019m old enough to remember when \u201cCaroline Lucas should lead a national unity government\u201d was just another fringe idea found in the hinterlands of Twitter. Alas, a week is such a long time in politics that Caroline Lucas has managed to jump on the bandwagon herself. As a Green party member I find the whole thing intensely embarrassing. Yes, the party has its share of weirdos and cranks, just like every other party, but they have been on the right side of the most important political divides in our country for longer than Labour, and that\u2019s no small thing. Before 2015, the Greens were your only realistic choice if you wanted a wholeheartedly anti-austerity, anti-workfare party. Now that the Arctic is regularly catching fire it makes even more sense to support a party with environmental policy at its core. Unfortunately Brexit seems to have proven just as brain-meltingly toxic for the Greens as it has for every other party. Lucas, usually a canny parliamentary operator who can punch well above her weight, has inexplicably tied the party to an unworkable fantasy that only exists because hard remainers dislike Jeremy Corbyn more than they fear a no-deal Brexit. And that\u2019s without even getting into the fact that her fantasy 10-woman cabinet did not include a single woman of colour. It makes sense that centrists, having seen their ideology\u2019s reputation tank with the public, have now decided that democracy is a luxury we can no longer afford. It\u2019s a mistake, though, to see Brexit as being caused by too much democracy. Instead it should be seen as the result of the UK\u2019s democratic deficit. This cannot be fixed by telling people to sit down and be quiet: proper accountability, not technocratic backroom deals, is what\u2019s needed if parliament is to regain its legitimacy after this mess. Ironically the argument \u201cwe just want to stop no deal\u201d comes after the hard-remain faction\u2019s longstanding accusal of Corbyn as being a crypto-leaver because Labour\u2019s policies reflected a compromise between the party\u2019s soft-leave and remain wings: exactly the alliance this temporary government is supposed to be unifying against the hardline no-dealers. It\u2019s impossible to say what might have happened if this broad anti-no deal arrangement had been sought in 2016, or if certain factions hadn\u2019t been so keen to use remain as an anti-Corbyn Trojan horse. Even now, despite the fact that they\u2019re trying to implement what basically amounts to Labour party policy, they are still throwing a tantrum over involving the Labour leader. Corbyn\u2019s personal beliefs on Brexit are presented as the obstacle to working with him, but this contradicts the omnipresence of Yvette Cooper in every Stop Brexit fantasy proposal. Cooper\u2019s position on Brexit is barely distinguishable from Corbyn\u2019s: if anything, she is more hardline on some issues, like freedom of movement. It is difficult not to conclude that, even at the 11th hour, the problem is not Corbyn\u2019s beliefs but a resistance to him as prime minister, whatever the circumstances. That\u2019s why it makes no sense for Lucas to get involved in these shenanigans. There is much more alignment between Green party policy and the direction of Labour under Corbyn than there would be if the centrists succeeded in wresting back control of the party. The Greens don\u2019t need to wholeheartedly back Corbyn, and should still campaign against Labour where the parties are in disagreement. But they should recognise that as a minor party it does them much more good to work with those who agree broadly with their overall policy platform than to seek out narrow alliances with people who will jettison them as soon as they are no longer useful. Lucas wrote: \u201cPolitical tribalism would likely scupper any moves that are just about putting Jeremy Corbyn in charge\u201d \u2013 but despite his unpopularity among \u201cthe sensibles\u201d, Corbyn remains the leader of the opposition and commands sufficient support within his party to ensure any challenger is seen off. No national unity gubbins can get past the fact that all roads to stopping Brexit run through a Labour government. Whether you believe Corbyn is pro-Brexit or not, he is against no deal, unlike Johnson\u2019s cabinet. Remainers seem to understand that it would be awful if the decision put before parliament \u2013 or put to the public in a second referendum \u2013 was \u201cJohnson\u2019s deal v no deal\u201d, but would seemingly rather try anything before making the choice of \u201cCorbyn\u2019s deal v remain\u201d. If it is so important that no deal is prevented at all costs, if this is not just all political posturing, then the \u201cno Corbyns\u201d sign has to come down off the treehouse. \u2022 Phil McDuff writes on economics and social policy",

      "bodyText": "In 2014, India sent the Mars Orbiter Mission into space, and became the first country to send a satellite to orbit the planet at its first attempt \u2013 putting its much richer regional rival China in the shade as it became the first Asian nation to get to the red planet. The project was notable for being led by a team of female scientists; as is India\u2019s second lunar probe, Chandrayaan-2 (from the Sanskrit for \u201cmoon craft\u201d), which was launched last month and is due to land on the moon in early September. And as the country establishes itself as a space power, Indians have developed an appetite for sci-fi themes in its cinema. The patriotic outburst that followed the Mars mission has fuelled the latest example of Indian space cinema: Mission Mangal (Sanskrit for Mars), a fictionalised account of the Orbiter Mission. Starring and produced by Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar, it is due for release on 15 August, India\u2019s Independence Day. \u201cI would follow the news about India\u2019s space missions and feel proud of what we were achieving,\u201d says Kumar. \u201cBut through Mission Mangal I guess you could say I have an insider\u2019s perspective.\u201d Kumar, one of the highest paid actors in the world, says he had long wanted to work with the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). Starring in a film about Mangalyaan (\u201cMars craft\u201d) required him to take a crash course in astrophysics. \u201cI now understand the amount of effort and planning it takes to successfully execute a space mission and my respect for all the scientists and engineers who work on these missions has grown immensely,\u201d says Kumar. Sci-fi isn\u2019t a new genre in Indian cinema, but it has nothing like the profile it has in the west. It only established itself after the country\u2019s economy liberalised in the 1990s, allowing the entry of satellite channels and foreign movies, as well as studios such as Disney and Warner into Bollywood production. Before then, what little there was consisted mostly of low-budget fare involving superheroes. The biggest success was 2003\u2019s Koi \u2026 Mil Gaya (Found Someone), an ET: The Extra-Terrestrial rip-off in which Hrithik Roshan is healed of his intellectual disability \u2013 in his 20s, he still hasn\u2019t graduated from a primary school \u2013 by the magical touch of a blue alien he befriends, who transforms him into a muscular high-school sports star, girl-magnet and maths genius. With possibly the crassest portrayal of an adult with a learning disability one could ever see, Koi \u2026 Mil Gaya was Roshan\u2019s breakthrough performance, making him a star and winning him a national Filmfare award. Fortunately, sci-fi has moved on a great deal since, given India\u2019s greater exposure to foreign films. \u201cIndian audiences have responded enthusiastically to space and sci-fi films such as the Star Wars series or the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise,\u201d Kumar says. \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s a genre that hasn\u2019t been explored in Bollywood.\u201d One reason might be the box office failure of Love Story 2050 in 2008. A frenzied time travel movie, it broke India\u2019s film-budget record, but its mix of Mad Max futurism, slushy romance and traditional Bollywood song-and-dance routines was a flop. While Hollywood has a long tradition of making more naturalistic films about space travel \u2013 from 2001: A Space Odyssey, to Gravity and First Man \u2013 it\u2019s only now, with the enormous strides in India\u2019s own space exploration, that such films are beginning to resonate with the public. \u201cIt\u2019s about time\u201d says Kumar, \u201cbecause this is one genre of film that appeals to people across all age groups.

      "body": "<p>It is the world\u2019s biggest comedy festival, with jokes cracked all day long in pubs, lecture rooms, basements, attics and cupboards across the city. Comedians come for exposure, to hone their craft or, simply, for a laugh. They will almost certainly lose money and are gambling on their gags, so many bunk together to save cash. I went to five houseshares to find out how comedians survive \u2013 and maybe even enjoy \u2013 performing amid the intense pressure and competition of the Edinburgh fringe.</p> \n<h2><strong>The Friends flat</strong></h2> \n<p>\u201cMy room\u2019s haunted,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/aug/25/edinburgh-award-champ-rose-matafeo-horndog-comedy\" title=\"\">Rose Matafeo</a>. \u201cA big shaft of light came through my curtains.\u201d Her flatmates roar with laughter. \u201cIt\u2019s the sun,\u201d shouts Alice Snedden. \u201cIt was at night,\u201d insists Matafeo. \u201cIt looked like a question mark.\u201d</p> \n<p>This vision will strike a chord with any comic lying in bed \u2013 or couch surfing \u2013 who is asking themselves: \u201cWhat am I doing here?\u201d For Matafeo and her fellow New Zealander flatmates, the answer is: a solo show each and late-night improv together.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4512efdaef511486107ac3c632ed8b05b7e496e4\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4512efdaef511486107ac3c632ed8b05b7e496e4/0_192_5393_3236/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Guy Montgomery, Rose Matafeo, Chris Parker, Eli Matthewson and Alice Snedden at home.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Guy Montgomery, Rose Matafeo, Chris Parker, Eli Matthewson and Alice Snedden at home.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Matafeo won the Edinburgh comedy award with her show <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/rose-matafeo-horndog\" title=\"\">Horndog</a> last summer and is now back in Scotland for a short run.

A solo show can feel, says Matafeo, like Groundhog Day, as you perform the same set over again. Snedden even has the same venue \u2013 and time slot \u2013 as last year: \u201cI\u2019m going crazy.\u201d \u201cPeople go crazy at the fringe,\u201d Matafeo agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to have a bubble to escape that.\u201d Upon arriving, she buys extra pillows, candles and \u201cjust so much yarn\u201d.</p> \n<p>Before their joint late-night gig, the Snort gang discuss their solo shows, but focus on who had a blinder, not who bombed. \u201cWe let their positivity spread across the group,\u201d says Montgomery. Afterwards, they unwind in their New Town flat by watching Friends or a new favourite, the evil gameshow Golden Balls.</p> \n<p>In the mornings, Parker wakes them up for the \u201ccoffee train\u201d \u2013 toot-tooting as he leaves for the daily hot beverage trip. Sneddon and Matafeo do a lot of cooking. Roasting chicken is how Snedden deals with anxiety, says Matafeo. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"78adf7a8-43b9-487c-bf2e-3087ad01787e\"

But the only real downside to their digs is that the wifi is child-locked.

He\u2019s losing his voice, because he does six daytime gigs then, after a power nap, stays out partying. He leans towards Ronseal titles, such as 101 Clean Jokes in 30 Minutes, a set followed by 101 Naughty jokes.</p> \n<p>Graham works full-time with autistic children and the fringe is his hobby and holiday. He haemorrhaged money the first year, but became so popular at one venue they paid his rent. Last year, he took home \u00a38,000.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d631ef507df1605592a185c234f6e345386369ee\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d631ef507df1605592a185c234f6e345386369ee/0_180_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Masai Graham, Jay Handley, Darren Harriott and Eshaan Akbar in their Edinburgh rental flat.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Masai Graham, Jay Handley, Darren Harriott and Eshaan Akbar in their Edinburgh rental flat.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Graham is staying with his mate from the West Midlands, <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/darren-harriott-good-heart-yute\" title=\"\">Darren Harriott</a>, a professional comic and best newcomer nominee in 2017. His show, Good Heart Yute, tours in the autumn and Harriott has decided to write a new joke for it every day. Standups stress too much about shows being perfect for the start of the festival, he thinks. \u201cIt should be ready by the end.\u201d</p> \n<p>The pressure comes from knowing that among the punters are industry insiders who could send their careers rocketing. Harriott and Graham\u2019s housemate <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/eshaan-akbar-infidel-ity\" title=\"\">Eshaan Akbar</a> has already been booked for a panel show.

Akbar watches other shows.

      "bodyText": "It is the world\u2019s biggest comedy festival, with jokes cracked all day long in pubs, lecture rooms, basements, attics and cupboards across the city. Comedians come for exposure, to hone their craft or, simply, for a laugh. They will almost certainly lose money and are gambling on their gags, so many bunk together to save cash. I went to five houseshares to find out how comedians survive \u2013 and maybe even enjoy \u2013 performing amid the intense pressure and competition of the Edinburgh fringe. The Friends flat \u201cMy room\u2019s haunted,\u201d says Rose Matafeo. \u201cA big shaft of light came through my curtains.\u201d Her flatmates roar with laughter. \u201cIt\u2019s the sun,\u201d shouts Alice Snedden. \u201cIt was at night,\u201d insists Matafeo. \u201cIt looked like a question mark.\u201d This vision will strike a chord with any comic lying in bed \u2013 or couch surfing \u2013 who is asking themselves: \u201cWhat am I doing here?\u201d For Matafeo and her fellow New Zealander flatmates, the answer is: a solo show each and late-night improv together. Matafeo won the Edinburgh comedy award with her show Horndog last summer and is now back in Scotland for a short run. She is also directing Snedden\u2019s show. While Chris Parker, Eli Matthewson and Guy Montgomery join them for the improv Snort; when I went along, they were portraying pasta cops called Al Dente and Al Fresco. The five have performed together for years and regularly flatshare at festivals. A solo show can feel, says Matafeo, like Groundhog Day, as you perform the same set over again. Snedden even has the same venue \u2013 and time slot \u2013 as last year: \u201cI\u2019m going crazy.\u201d \u201cPeople go crazy at the fringe,\u201d Matafeo agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to have a bubble to escape that.\u201d Upon arriving, she buys extra pillows, candles and \u201cjust so much yarn\u201d. Before their joint late-night gig, the Snort gang discuss their solo shows, but focus on who had a blinder, not who bombed. \u201cWe let their positivity spread across the group,\u201d says Montgomery. Afterwards, they unwind in their New Town flat by watching Friends or a new favourite, the evil gameshow Golden Balls. In the mornings, Parker wakes them up for the \u201ccoffee train\u201d \u2013 toot-tooting as he leaves for the daily hot beverage trip. Sneddon and Matafeo do a lot of cooking. Roasting chicken is how Snedden deals with anxiety, says Matafeo. In true flatshare style, the best rooms were nabbed first. \u201cI arrived a day late and got the smallest bed,\u201d Matthewson complains. \u201cAnd I\u2019m the only one with a partner visiting!\u201d The others are nonplussed. \u201cYou two will be craving physical intimacy,\u201d says Montgomery. But the only real downside to their digs is that the wifi is child-locked. Anyone seeking porn will have to go old school, they say, as they briefly consider reading erotic fiction to each other. The joke flat Across town, I meet gag merchant Masai Graham, a winner of the UK Pun Championships and Best Joke of the Fringe. He\u2019s losing his voice, because he does six daytime gigs then, after a power nap, stays out partying. He leans towards Ronseal titles, such as 101 Clean Jokes in 30 Minutes, a set followed by 101 Naughty jokes. Graham works full-time with autistic children and the fringe is his hobby and holiday. He haemorrhaged money the first year, but became so popular at one venue they paid his rent. Last year, he took home \u00a38,000. Graham is staying with his mate from the West Midlands, Darren Harriott, a professional comic and best newcomer nominee in 2017. His show, Good Heart Yute, tours in the autumn and Harriott has decided to write a new joke for it every day. Standups stress too much about shows being perfect for the start of the festival, he thinks. \u201cIt should be ready by the end.\u201d The pressure comes from knowing that among the punters are industry insiders who could send their careers rocketing. Harriott and Graham\u2019s housemate Eshaan Akbar has already been booked for a panel show. T Jay Handley, the fourth person in the flat says some comics \u201cthink the only way to have a good time is to win an award or get five-star reviews\u201d. During the day, Handley clears his head at a bouldering centre. Akbar watches other shows. In their kitchen, they will help each other with jokes that aren\u2019t working, but when one of them is dying on stage, that\u2019s is a sight to be relished: \u201cThe funniest thing,\u201d says Graham. The family flatshare Lucy Beaumont first went to Edinburgh as an actor in a French play about abortion. It had one audience member all week \u2013 and he only came in to eat his sandwiches. Returning as a comedian, she stayed with some \u201ccreepy\u201d people. \u201cI rang my mum and said: \u2018If you don\u2019t hear from me again, you need to know they\u2019ve done it. There\u2019ll be no trace of me.\u2019\u201d This year, she is sharing a beautifully airy flat with her husband, the comedian Jon Richardson, and their chatty two-year-old daughterwho, while we have a cup of tea, is playing with her Sylvanian Families toys. It is a cheery scene. \u201cYou join us three days in,\u201d says Richardson, pointing around the room. \u201cThis will be in pieces. We\u2019ll all be in pieces!\u201d Their day revolves around Beaumont\u2019s warmly witty show, Space Mam, which is directed by Johnny Vegas. \u201cIt\u2019s about being a mum \u2026 and aliens,\u201d Beaumont explains. Her showIt starts at 4.45pm so she can \u201cget home for bathtime\u201d. How much do the couple discuss their material at home? \u201cI\u2019ll keep it quiet until I\u2019m finished,\u201d says Richardson, turning to Beaumont. \u201cYou discuss it a lot earlier on, don\u2019t you?\u201d He will tell Beaumont any jokes he is making about her and scrap those she doesn\u2019t like. She admits he had a gag that she \u201csort of claimed\u201d. \u201cYou stole it, to be fair,\u201d he retorts. Beaumont smiles sweetly: \u201cI did it funnier than you, so felt I deserved it.\u201d Beaumont and Richardson have recently filmed a sitcom \u2013 partly improvised \u2013 based on their home life. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of arguing,\u201d says Richardson. A TV regular, Richardson hasn\u2019t done an Edinburgh run for years, he says, because he doesn\u2019t want to take tickets away from other comics. \u201cI would rather people saw someone new than me doing a show I\u2019ve already done on tour.\u201d This year, he is in a one-night charity gala. Richardson and Beaumont take turns to have nights out to see gigs. If you do a bad gig in Edinburgh, says Richardson, you walk home past posters for hundreds of comics and imagine they have all triumphed. Beaumont says she used to get jealous of other comics \u2013 especially those \u201cfrom really affluent backgrounds. I always felt they seemed more relaxed.\u201d The city\u2019s ever-increasing rents can price out working-class comics, she says, remembering accruing debts when she performed here.

Demand also continues to be dented by Brexit uncertainty.

      "bodyText": "The travel firm Tui has reported a 46% drop in quarterly profits after a dip in bookings after last year\u2019s heatwave and ongoing Brexit uncertainty, while also being hit by hefty costs over the grounding of Boeing 737 Max aircraft. Tui had already issued two profit warnings this year, in part due to the impact of the 737 Max grounding, but stuck to its full-year guidance on Tuesday. It is forecasting a 26% drop from last year\u2019s underlying earnings of \u20ac1.18bn (\u00a31.09bn). The firm\u2019s earnings fell to \u20ac100.9m from \u20ac186.8m in the three months to 30 June, its third quarter. It blamed extra costs of \u20ac144m after Boeing grounded its 737 Max planes following two fatal crashes, as Tui had to lease replacement aircraft. The company still expects this to raise total costs of up to \u20ac300m over the year as a whole. Tui is the second-largest operator of the 737 Max in Europe \u2013 its fleet of 150 aircraft includes 15 of the troubled planes, and it had ordered another eight. Tui said summer bookings slipped 1% in the quarter with customers booking later, tempted to stay home after last year\u2019s scorching temperatures. Demand also continues to be dented by Brexit uncertainty. Of those who do travel, many are heading to Turkey or north Africa, leaving Tui with too much capacity in Spain. It wants to ramp up the transformation of its tour operating business to become an online platform selling holidays rather than a traditional tour operator. Tui announced the sale of two specialist German tour operators on Monday. Analysts at Jefferies said: \u201cWe see this as positive as Tui further reduces its dependence on the traditional tour operator model.\u201d To reduce its reliance on Europe, the company, which has more than 21 million customers, said it would \u201ctap new markets, in particular in emerging economies with growing middle classes such as China, India, Brazil and Malaysia\u201d. It has entered a partnership with Malaysian Airlines to provide holidays to the carrier\u2019s customers. Turnover grew 4.4% to \u20ac4.8bn in the quarter. Friedrich Joussen, the chief executive, said: \u201cDespite the challenging environment in 2019 to date, our underlying business remains robust, and we expect to deliver a solid performance in 2019, which, however, will not match the prior year\u2019s result, as expected due to the grounding of the 737 Max.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Damian Robinson knew it was a cliche to propose to his partner, Amanda, on Christmas Day 2015, but he did it anyway. \u201cI just sat down next to her on the couch, and handed her the ring,\u201d the 49-year-old construction worker from Warrington remembers.</p> <p>They wed at a register office in Prescot, near Liverpool, in August 2017. The ceremony was small \u2013 close family and friends \u2013 and Damian read a Pablo Neruda poem. It was especially nice having Damian\u2019s nephew Sam there, as a reminder of their unique love story. Because Sam had been there the first time Amanda and Damian got married, in July 1994. Back then, Sam was a scamp of a boy, dressed in a sailor suit. This time around, he was their best man.</p> <p>Marrying the same person twice isn\u2019t the sort of thing you associate with Prescot register offices \u2013 it is a celebrity business. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/sep/12/eva-sereny-best-photograph-liz-taylor-richard-burton-angry-looks\" title=\"\">Liz Taylor and Richard Burton</a> are the most famous example, but in 2013 the tech billionaire Elon Musk and the British actor Talulah Riley did the same. Natalie Wood, Elliott Gould and Rosemary Clooney all remarried former partners. In 2015, Felicity Kendal divulged that she was back with her second husband, the director Michael Rudman, before ruling out marrying him again.</p> <p>Despite these high-profile cases, the phenomenon of couples divorcing and remarrying is so rare that data does not exist on its prevalence. \u201cWhen you talk about divorces, some people don\u2019t even want to talk to each other afterwards!\u201d says Dr Nancy Kalish of California State University. An expert on rekindled romances, Kalish tells me that reconnecting with a lost love \u2013 but not someone you were not married to \u2013 is more common, particularly as social media makes it easier to get in touch with old flames. \u201cThere\u2019s always someone who knows someone who has done it,\u201d says Kalish, estimating that one person in 100 will give a lover from long ago a second shot.</p> <p>\u201cNever in a million years did I think we would end up back together,\u201d says 45-year-old Jen Brimacombe, from Plymouth. She is in high spirits, having just returned from a delayed honeymoon with husband Davide to Fuerteventura. They remarried in 2017, on what would have been the 25th anniversary of their first wedding.</p> <p>Jen and Davide met through friends shortly before Jen\u2019s 16th birthday. \u201cWe were in a park and he put on his friend\u2019s hat. I said: \u2018Oooh, you look like Jason Donovan!\u2019\u201d Jen quickly became pregnant with sons Matthew and Luke. Over the next few years, they clashed about the predictable things you would expect the broke young parents of toddlers to argue about: money, childcare and chores. \u201cHe\u2019d go out with his friends, and I\u2019d be left at home with the kids.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7905d29633bd5dfc80a0d71e69320f93f43a7354\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7905d29633bd5dfc80a0d71e69320f93f43a7354/0_0_960_957/500.jpg\" alt=\"Jen Brimacombe and her husband Davide at their second wedding in 2017.\" width=\"500\" height=\"498\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jen Brimacombe and her husband Davide at their second wedding in 2017. They first married in 1992.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Provided by Jen Brimacombe</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Determined to make a go of things, they married in 1992, but separated in 1995, three weeks before Jen gave birth to their daughter Coral. It was a drawn-out breakup: although they divorced in 1997, it wasn\u2019t until 2000 that Jen finally cut contact. \u201cWe had a row over something really stupid, and I just thought: I\u2019m not doing this any more. I\u2019ve had enough.\u201d</p> <p>In 2009, Davide drove Jen and Coral to a parents\u2019 evening. In the backseat, Coral must have wondered why her parents were getting on so well \u2013 they didn\u2019t stop talking, not even after Jen invited Davide in for a cuppa and a three-hour long chat. A few days later, they went for a drive on the Moors. Davide confided that his second marriage was over, and he still had feelings for Jen. \u201cI was like, oh my God, something can finally happen. There is a chance. Something can happen now,\u201d Jen remembers.</p> <p>Health and money issues devastated Damian and Amanda\u2019s first marriage. After meeting at the supermarket where they worked in St Helens, they married at the age of 25 and 22 respectively, and had two daughters. But Amanda became frustrated that Damian wasted money on frivolous purchases \u2013 once he bought a collection of 20 DVDs \u2013 and Damian was exhausted from taking on the bulk of the housework and childcare, as Amanda had back problems.</p> <p>Mutual resentment built up. They divorced in 2006, and fought each other in the family courts. \u201cThe bitterness was mainly from me,\u201d Damian admits. Amanda had a son before separating from her new partner. In 2011, Amanda\u2019s two-year-old son was hospitalised, and Damian went to visit them in Warrington Hospital. In the fluorescent chill of a hospital corridor, their love spluttered and sparked back into life. \u201cShe was upset and worried about her son,\u201d Damian remembers. \u201cI just held her hand.\u201d When Amanda squeezed it back, Damian \u201cfelt indescribably happy\u201d. From that one hand-hold, they reconciled.</p> <p>Damian and Amanda match the profile of the couples Kalish has studied who reunite after years apart. \u201cThey separate for situational reasons, and when they get back together those reasons aren\u2019t there any more,\u201d Kalish summarises. Children are grown up; money is not so tight. The slings and arrows of everyday life no longer rain down on them in the same way. \u201cEvery day turned into a bit of a grind,\u201d Damian recalls. \u201cYou get worn down, and it starts spilling out into frustration with each other. You forget why you were together in the first place. Everything is a chore.\u201d</p> <p>When we think of the things that drive lovers apart, it is often the grand betrayals: adultery, addiction, abuse. But more typically, it is the vicissitudes of daily life. Jobs lost unexpectedly; unplanned pregnancies. Or the smaller things: cross words over undone dishes. A DVD collection you can\u2019t afford.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"33d5a83e7d4d82c622513d84e7fa4c4aa58e9bd7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33d5a83e7d4d82c622513d84e7fa4c4aa58e9bd7/0_160_992_1240/800.jpg\" alt=\"Damian Robinson and Amanda Rogers at their first wedding in 1994.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Damian Robinson and Amanda Rogers at their first wedding in 1994.

Extramarital affairs are a common unforced error. When Chris Craik, 65, from Newcastle upon Tyne, met Dee in 1970, it was love at first sight. They married in 1972 and had two children. But Chris worked long hours as an RAF technician, and Dee was preoccupied with the kids. \u201cWe were moving in opposite directions. She was maternal; I worked long hours. I would get home, and she would be tired from the children.\u201d He had an affair, and was caught climbing a fence in married quarters. In 1979, Dee moved back to Newcastle with the children.</p> <p>Almost immediately, Chris realised he had made a catastrophic mistake. He begged Dee for another chance. She agreed, but only if he could move to Newcastle to be with his family. Chris asked his commanding officer for a transfer, but it was denied. Life ebbed and eddied away. Both remarried; Chris returned to his native Australia in 1983.</p> <p>A common theme in these stories of love lost and regained is the presence of children binding former partners together. When a calamity should befall them \u2013 a toddler sick in the hospital, or the grief of losing a son \u2013 the parents lurch back into each other\u2019s arms. In 2009, Chris and Dee\u2019s son died unexpectedly following a stroke. In their grief, they began talking again. Chris relocated to the UK to be closer to his daughter, divorcing his second wife in the process. Spending more time with Dee confirmed what Chris had suspected: divorcing her had been the greatest mistake of his life. \u201cWe were both so young when we went through the divorce. I was very headstrong. I thought: it\u2019s easier to get a divorce.\u201d</p> <p>As Dee had remarried, Chris kept his distance. But in 2011, his daughter told him some momentous news: Dee and her second husband were separating. \u201cShe said: \u2018Don\u2019t go there!\u2019 I said: \u2018What do you mean?\u2019 She said: \u2018I can see. You look at Mum, and I can see. Don\u2019t you go anywhere near her until it\u2019s all done and dusted,\u2019\u201d Chris chuckles. They reunited later that year.</p> <p>If you believe our personalities are immutable, it is hard to explain why some couples get a do-over. Surely the issues that tanked your relationship the first time around will scupper it again? But the passage of time causes people to mellow. Tempers don\u2019t flare up like before. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cb3c21df3c9a3ad48c6722b76f50ced279e89499\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb3c21df3c9a3ad48c6722b76f50ced279e89499/0_0_4584_3048/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Craik and his wife Dee at their wedding in 1972.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Craik and his wife Dee at their wedding in 1972. Chris was planning to propose again when Dee died in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Provided by Chris Craik</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Damian says: \u201cThe five years we\u2019d spent apart, I\u2019d learned to become a better person. With maturity comes patience and tolerance. We probably understand and appreciate each other\u2019s needs a lot more now.\u201d Chris is also self-critical. \u201cI wasn\u2019t really a nice person, the first time around. And back then, Dee was very quiet and passive. The second time around, I\u2019d grown up and got a bit softer, and Dee had got more assertive, and confident with dealing with me. We just blended straight away.\u201d</p> <p>Those who have been given a second chance at lost love know not to take anything for granted. You have to work at relationships; a little bit every day. Damian does Amanda\u2019s ironing and brings her cups of tea in the morning without grumbling. \u201cI\u2019m far more appreciative of her now and will do things for her without even thinking.\u201d</p> <p>But not all second chances have picture-postcard happy endings. The ragged, impersonal contours of fate may throw your love back into your life for a while, before wrenching them away. After reconciling, Chris and Dee spent five happy years together. They holidayed abroad, and had date nights looking after their grandchildren.</p> <p>In January 2016, Chris decided to surprise Dee by proposing to her the following month, on her birthday.

      "bodyText": "Damian Robinson knew it was a cliche to propose to his partner, Amanda, on Christmas Day 2015, but he did it anyway. \u201cI just sat down next to her on the couch, and handed her the ring,\u201d the 49-year-old construction worker from Warrington remembers. They wed at a register office in Prescot, near Liverpool, in August 2017. The ceremony was small \u2013 close family and friends \u2013 and Damian read a Pablo Neruda poem. It was especially nice having Damian\u2019s nephew Sam there, as a reminder of their unique love story. Because Sam had been there the first time Amanda and Damian got married, in July 1994. Back then, Sam was a scamp of a boy, dressed in a sailor suit. This time around, he was their best man. Marrying the same person twice isn\u2019t the sort of thing you associate with Prescot register offices \u2013 it is a celebrity business. Liz Taylor and Richard Burton are the most famous example, but in 2013 the tech billionaire Elon Musk and the British actor Talulah Riley did the same. Natalie Wood, Elliott Gould and Rosemary Clooney all remarried former partners. In 2015, Felicity Kendal divulged that she was back with her second husband, the director Michael Rudman, before ruling out marrying him again. Despite these high-profile cases, the phenomenon of couples divorcing and remarrying is so rare that data does not exist on its prevalence. \u201cWhen you talk about divorces, some people don\u2019t even want to talk to each other afterwards!\u201d says Dr Nancy Kalish of California State University. An expert on rekindled romances, Kalish tells me that reconnecting with a lost love \u2013 but not someone you were not married to \u2013 is more common, particularly as social media makes it easier to get in touch with old flames. \u201cThere\u2019s always someone who knows someone who has done it,\u201d says Kalish, estimating that one person in 100 will give a lover from long ago a second shot. \u201cNever in a million years did I think we would end up back together,\u201d says 45-year-old Jen Brimacombe, from Plymouth. She is in high spirits, having just returned from a delayed honeymoon with husband Davide to Fuerteventura. They remarried in 2017, on what would have been the 25th anniversary of their first wedding. Jen and Davide met through friends shortly before Jen\u2019s 16th birthday. \u201cWe were in a park and he put on his friend\u2019s hat. I said: \u2018Oooh, you look like Jason Donovan!\u2019\u201d Jen quickly became pregnant with sons Matthew and Luke. Over the next few years, they clashed about the predictable things you would expect the broke young parents of toddlers to argue about: money, childcare and chores. \u201cHe\u2019d go out with his friends, and I\u2019d be left at home with the kids.\u201d Determined to make a go of things, they married in 1992, but separated in 1995, three weeks before Jen gave birth to their daughter Coral. It was a drawn-out breakup: although they divorced in 1997, it wasn\u2019t until 2000 that Jen finally cut contact. \u201cWe had a row over something really stupid, and I just thought: I\u2019m not doing this any more. I\u2019ve had enough.\u201d In 2009, Davide drove Jen and Coral to a parents\u2019 evening. In the backseat, Coral must have wondered why her parents were getting on so well \u2013 they didn\u2019t stop talking, not even after Jen invited Davide in for a cuppa and a three-hour long chat. A few days later, they went for a drive on the Moors. Davide confided that his second marriage was over, and he still had feelings for Jen. \u201cI was like, oh my God, something can finally happen. There is a chance. Something can happen now,\u201d Jen remembers. Health and money issues devastated Damian and Amanda\u2019s first marriage. After meeting at the supermarket where they worked in St Helens, they married at the age of 25 and 22 respectively, and had two daughters. But Amanda became frustrated that Damian wasted money on frivolous purchases \u2013 once he bought a collection of 20 DVDs \u2013 and Damian was exhausted from taking on the bulk of the housework and childcare, as Amanda had back problems. Mutual resentment built up. They divorced in 2006, and fought each other in the family courts. \u201cThe bitterness was mainly from me,\u201d Damian admits. Amanda had a son before separating from her new partner. In 2011, Amanda\u2019s two-year-old son was hospitalised, and Damian went to visit them in Warrington Hospital. In the fluorescent chill of a hospital corridor, their love spluttered and sparked back into life. \u201cShe was upset and worried about her son,\u201d Damian remembers. \u201cI just held her hand.\u201d When Amanda squeezed it back, Damian \u201cfelt indescribably happy\u201d. From that one hand-hold, they reconciled. Damian and Amanda match the profile of the couples Kalish has studied who reunite after years apart. \u201cThey separate for situational reasons, and when they get back together those reasons aren\u2019t there any more,\u201d Kalish summarises. Children are grown up; money is not so tight. The slings and arrows of everyday life no longer rain down on them in the same way. \u201cEvery day turned into a bit of a grind,\u201d Damian recalls. \u201cYou get worn down, and it starts spilling out into frustration with each other. You forget why you were together in the first place. Everything is a chore.\u201d When we think of the things that drive lovers apart, it is often the grand betrayals: adultery, addiction, abuse. But more typically, it is the vicissitudes of daily life. Jobs lost unexpectedly; unplanned pregnancies. Or the smaller things: cross words over undone dishes. A DVD collection you can\u2019t afford. Not all relationships founder in the rock-filled waters of money woes and childrearing. Extramarital affairs are a common unforced error. When Chris Craik, 65, from Newcastle upon Tyne, met Dee in 1970, it was love at first sight. They married in 1972 and had two children. But Chris worked long hours as an RAF technician, and Dee was preoccupied with the kids. \u201cWe were moving in opposite directions. She was maternal; I worked long hours. I would get home, and she would be tired from the children.\u201d He had an affair, and was caught climbing a fence in married quarters. In 1979, Dee moved back to Newcastle with the children. Almost immediately, Chris realised he had made a catastrophic mistake. He begged Dee for another chance. She agreed, but only if he could move to Newcastle to be with his family. Chris asked his commanding officer for a transfer, but it was denied. Life ebbed and eddied away. Both remarried; Chris returned to his native Australia in 1983. A common theme in these stories of love lost and regained is the presence of children binding former partners together. When a calamity should befall them \u2013 a toddler sick in the hospital, or the grief of losing a son \u2013 the parents lurch back into each other\u2019s arms. In 2009, Chris and Dee\u2019s son died unexpectedly following a stroke. In their grief, they began talking again. Chris relocated to the UK to be closer to his daughter, divorcing his second wife in the process. Spending more time with Dee confirmed what Chris had suspected: divorcing her had been the greatest mistake of his life. \u201cWe were both so young when we went through the divorce. I was very headstrong. I thought: it\u2019s easier to get a divorce.\u201d As Dee had remarried, Chris kept his distance. But in 2011, his daughter told him some momentous news: Dee and her second husband were separating. \u201cShe said: \u2018Don\u2019t go there!\u2019 I said: \u2018What do you mean?\u2019 She said: \u2018I can see. You look at Mum, and I can see. Don\u2019t you go anywhere near her until it\u2019s all done and dusted,\u2019\u201d Chris chuckles. They reunited later that year. If you believe our personalities are immutable, it is hard to explain why some couples get a do-over. Surely the issues that tanked your relationship the first time around will scupper it again? But the passage of time causes people to mellow. Tempers don\u2019t flare up like before. Damian says: \u201cThe five years we\u2019d spent apart, I\u2019d learned to become a better person. With maturity comes patience and tolerance. We probably understand and appreciate each other\u2019s needs a lot more now.\u201d Chris is also self-critical. \u201cI wasn\u2019t really a nice person, the first time around. And back then, Dee was very quiet and passive. The second time around, I\u2019d grown up and got a bit softer, and Dee had got more assertive, and confident with dealing with me. We just blended straight away.\u201d Those who have been given a second chance at lost love know not to take anything for granted. You have to work at relationships; a little bit every day. Damian does Amanda\u2019s ironing and brings her cups of tea in the morning without grumbling. \u201cI\u2019m far more appreciative of her now and will do things for her without even thinking.\u201d But not all second chances have picture-postcard happy endings. The ragged, impersonal contours of fate may throw your love back into your life for a while, before wrenching them away. After reconciling, Chris and Dee spent five happy years together. They holidayed abroad, and had date nights looking after their grandchildren. In January 2016, Chris decided to surprise Dee by proposing to her the following month, on her birthday. He commissioned a replica of her wedding band from a local jeweller. (She had sold the original, when times were hard.) The ring was still being made when Dee began complaining of a headache one Sunday evening in bed. She went to the bathroom to be sick. Chris heard her slump to the floor. \u201cShe looked up at me, and the light just went out of her eyes.\u201d Dee died the following morning from a stroke. It was a body blow. \u201cI got so close to having it all again, and it was all snatched away,\u201d says Chris. \u201cI was a very angry man for about six months.\u201d In time, Chris felt grateful that he had known Dee again, even briefly. \u201cI got a second chance. How many guys get that, a second chance with their first love? And it was absolute, pure delight. The whole five years we spent together was perfect.\u201d These real-life stories of love lost and found again can teach us lessons about change, romance and the ways in which the grind of daily life can whittle once-muscular relationships down into nubs of bone. They are also, in their own way, enormously uplifting. Because who doesn\u2019t want to believe that \u2013 after years spent apart and crossed words and blazing rows \u2013 love might find a way? At Dee\u2019s funeral, Chris handed out her favourite Corinthians verse. Love is patient. Love is kind. Love is not grumbling about the housework, or DVD collections, or climbing fences in married quarters. Chris\u2019s advice for couples contemplating reuniting is simple. \u201cHave a crack at it. But you\u2019ve got to change. You have to consider the other person\u2019s point of view, every time. That\u2019s what love is about. It\u2019s about listening.\u201d Chris ended up having Dee\u2019s ring made anyway, as a family heirloom. It is a reminder of love lost, and found, and lost again, and how all things are possible \u2013 if you are willing to change. \u2022 This article was amended on 15 August 2019 to correct a mistaken reference to a \u201cregistry office\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>\u2018I\u2019m not the person most people think I am,\u201d says Daniel Hellmann in Traumboy (<strong>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606</strong>). That\u2019s partly because, when he\u2019s not working as a performance artist, he earns a living as a prostitute. Coming out as gay in his late teens was one thing; admitting to being a sex worker is another \u2013 although, now that he\u2019s made a show about it, the secret is out.</p> \n<p>But his sense of being another person is not entirely down to his job. Like any of us, he presents a different face according to the situation. A paying client might like him to be sexily enigmatic. That wouldn\u2019t work for his friends and family. To a theatre audience, he chooses to reveal yet another side of himself.</p> \n<p>Although Traumboy is ostensibly about a misunderstood occupation, fascinating in its illicitness, it is just as much about identity and appearances. It is this, not sex, that links the four autofictional shows brought together on the fringe as <a href=\"https://performingartsselection.ch/news/swiss-selection-edinburgh\">Swiss Selection Edinburgh</a>. Each is an attempt to get under the skin of the individual.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b26bf3c4560c33bc834c4b84880d821b622f1ade\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b26bf3c4560c33bc834c4b84880d821b622f1ade/490_678_5270_3162/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daniel Hellmann in Traumboy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Questioning our attitudes to sex \u2026 Daniel Hellmann in Traumboy.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This is most charmingly done in 8:8 (<strong>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606</strong>), a delicate, ephemeral and touching piece in which eight performers drawn from the Edinburgh community reveal something of themselves to an audience of eight. In a small basement room, they begin with a slow, almost motionless dance, showing different faces of themselves as they line up in horizontal and vertical arrangements.</p> \n<p>Created by Jessica Huber and Karin Arnold for Mercimax, the short performance is based on a simple idea. Eventually, the eight sit down in front of us and take turns giving true and false details about themselves. We get a glancing sense of their past and present, the emotional weight they carry and their sense of humour. They flesh out our first impressions, but it would be hard to say we knew much about them.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom

That\u2019s a question you ask after Traumgirl (<strong>\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606</strong>), a companion piece to Hellmann\u2019s show in which Anne Welenc talks about her life as a sex worker. It follows the form of Traumboy in its first-person exposition, interactive Q&amp;A and sequences of erotic dancing, but has an artlessness that makes it hard to separate the performer from the performance.</p> \n<p>Where Hellmann\u2019s piece has a genuine sense of inquiry into our attitudes to sex, Welenc\u2019s piece comes across as tawdry. Her engagement in the debate about the ethics of her job is half-hearted; there are weighty arguments on both sides that the show scarcely acknowledges. If we\u2019re to agree that sex work is a normal occupation, we\u2019d also have to wonder why it was worth making a show about. Clearly, it\u2019s a subject that fascinates us, but her personal story offers little illumination.</p> \n<p>By focusing so narrowly on the individual, the season (which also includes Mats Staub\u2019s video installation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/mar/13/talking-heads-the-kosovo-war-life-in-the-hitler-youth-and-the-trials-of-turning-21\">21: Memories of Growing Up</a>), risks turning in on itself and losing sight of the big picture.</p> \n<p>\u2022 At <a href=\"https://performingartsselection.ch/news/swiss-selection-edinburgh\">Summerhall, Edinburgh</a>, until 25 August.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/edinburgh-festival-2019+tone/reviews\">Read all our Edinburgh festival reviews</a>.</p></li> \n</ul>",

      "bodyText": "\u2018I\u2019m not the person most people think I am,\u201d says Daniel Hellmann in Traumboy (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606). That\u2019s partly because, when he\u2019s not working as a performance artist, he earns a living as a prostitute. Coming out as gay in his late teens was one thing; admitting to being a sex worker is another \u2013 although, now that he\u2019s made a show about it, the secret is out. But his sense of being another person is not entirely down to his job. Like any of us, he presents a different face according to the situation. A paying client might like him to be sexily enigmatic. That wouldn\u2019t work for his friends and family. To a theatre audience, he chooses to reveal yet another side of himself. Although Traumboy is ostensibly about a misunderstood occupation, fascinating in its illicitness, it is just as much about identity and appearances. It is this, not sex, that links the four autofictional shows brought together on the fringe as Swiss Selection Edinburgh. Each is an attempt to get under the skin of the individual. This is most charmingly done in 8:8 (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606), a delicate, ephemeral and touching piece in which eight performers drawn from the Edinburgh community reveal something of themselves to an audience of eight. In a small basement room, they begin with a slow, almost motionless dance, showing different faces of themselves as they line up in horizontal and vertical arrangements. Created by Jessica Huber and Karin Arnold for Mercimax, the short performance is based on a simple idea. Eventually, the eight sit down in front of us and take turns giving true and false details about themselves. We get a glancing sense of their past and present, the emotional weight they carry and their sense of humour. They flesh out our first impressions, but it would be hard to say we knew much about them. Then, however, you put on headphones. The performer sitting in front of you stares into your eyes while you listen to a recording of them talking. Behind the casual conversational remarks they made in public, you hear personal stories usually reserved for intimate acquaintances. It feels tender and intense. We clap at the end, but are we applauding the show or the people? That\u2019s a question you ask after Traumgirl (\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606), a companion piece to Hellmann\u2019s show in which Anne Welenc talks about her life as a sex worker. It follows the form of Traumboy in its first-person exposition, interactive Q&amp;A and sequences of erotic dancing, but has an artlessness that makes it hard to separate the performer from the performance. Where Hellmann\u2019s piece has a genuine sense of inquiry into our attitudes to sex, Welenc\u2019s piece comes across as tawdry. Her engagement in the debate about the ethics of her job is half-hearted; there are weighty arguments on both sides that the show scarcely acknowledges. If we\u2019re to agree that sex work is a normal occupation, we\u2019d also have to wonder why it was worth making a show about. Clearly, it\u2019s a subject that fascinates us, but her personal story offers little illumination. By focusing so narrowly on the individual, the season (which also includes Mats Staub\u2019s video installation 21: Memories of Growing Up), risks turning in on itself and losing sight of the big picture. \u2022 At Summerhall, Edinburgh, until 25 August.

Hong Kong is home to one of the world\u2019s busiest airports, with millions relying on the airport for connecting flights each month.

De Boer replaced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/aug/24/tata-martino-atlanta-united-mls-argentina-barcelona\">former Barcelona and Argentina boss Gerardo \u201cTata\u201d Martino</a> in January. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/mar/14/atlanta-united-mls-pity-martinez-frank-de-boer-concacaf-champions\">De Boer\u2019s start in Atlanta was familiar</a>: his team did not pick up a win from their first four MLS games. After Atlanta publicly set the goal of becoming the first American side to become Concacaf club champions since LA Galaxy in 2000, they crashed out in the quarter-finals. Atlanta scored 149 goals in MLS play over their first two seasons. They managed two in the first month of 2019. A Mercedes-Benz Stadium crowd of 70,382 booed De Boer\u2019s team off the field following a 1-1 draw against MLS expansion side FC Cincinnati in Atlanta\u2019s home opener.</p> <p>Results have since improved. De Boer says he never lost confidence during yet another dismal start. Now, into the second-half of the season, Atlanta are up to second place in MLS\u2019s Eastern Conference and have reached the final of the US Open Cup.</p> <p>De Boer is certain this recovery proves he would have achieved the same resurgence at Inter and Palace. \u201cI\u2019m convinced,\u201d he says over a double espresso in the lobby of Atlanta\u2019s palatial training center. \u201cI think if we get the time we should, we definitely turn it around, especially at Crystal Palace. We had a feeling, in training you saw it, that this is the moment we\u2019re going to go looking up and win games. And then they decided to sack me. Of course that\u2019s not the nicest feeling, but it\u2019s like that.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/aug/21/atlanta-united-mls-soccer-popularity-average-attendance\">46,000 fans a game: Atlanta United's strange success far from soccer's heartland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>De Boer claims to still have a good relationship with Crystal Palace fans: \u201cI think they know I put all my effort in it, and in England they just want to see that, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d But he feels shortchanged by his brief time at the club and believes he did not receive a fair chance at achieving the task with which he was charged.</p> <p>\u201cI was especially angry,\u201d de Boer says. \u201cThey do some promises and they have a philosophy: \u2018OK, we want to be a solid club.\u2019 For example, Crystal Palace, you have to also play like a modern team and don\u2019t play relegation football. If you want to do that, OK, one year you can survive, maybe two years. But one time you will go down, I am convinced.</p> <p>\u201cSo they wanted to change that, like Southampton was doing in that period. I saw that picture in front of me, so I had the feeling that I had time, but when the season started, you already see some signs that this is not the way. You always walk in front of a door, and it\u2019s not opening, and I had the feeling again, and also at Inter, that we have to do this and this, and then we make our steps forward.

Three months ago, his old clubs were close to meeting in a \u201cDe Boer derby\u201d of sorts at the Champions League final in Madrid.

I think maybe now it\u2019s a time that we see the result of that. The first 11 are quite OK, but then you have a really big gap, a lot of teams have that. In England, you have like 20, 30 good players, so the level will not drop that far.\u201d</p> <p>De Boer also talks about a more sinister aspect of European football. He recalls a game he played with Ajax at Hungary\u2019s Ferencv\u00e1ros. Fans directed ape noises at his black teammates, Patrick Kluivert and Edgar Davids. Decades later, racial abuse inside football grounds is still a problem across Europe. De Boer believes \u201creally big fines\u201d should be levied against teams whose supporters engage in racism and, if that doesn\u2019t work, closed stadiums and docked points should be looked at. \u201cIn Holland, we have a saying: \u2018If you don\u2019t learn it the soft way, you have to learn it the hard way.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>De Boer captained the Netherlands to a fourth-place finish at the 1998 World Cup in France. This year, the Dutch women reach the Women\u2019s World Cup final, where they lost to the US. The Royal Dutch Football Association, meanwhile, has taken the lead and committed to <a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/dutch-womens-national-team-reaches-agreement-for-equal-pay-ahead-of-world-cup-182729352.html\">level the pay for men\u2019s and women\u2019s national team players</a>. The women will receive annual raises through 2023, when their earnings for national team service will equal that of their male compatriots. The US women\u2019s team are involved in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/mar/08/usa-womens-team-sues-us-soccer-pay-equality\">their own dispute with their federation</a> over equal pay. De Boer, it is fair to say, has differing views.</p> <p>\u201cI think for me, it\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d De Boer says of the policy. \u201cIt\u2019s the same like tennis. If there are watching, for the World Cup final, 500 million people or something like that, and 100 million for a women\u2019s final, that\u2019s a difference. So it\u2019s not the same. And of course they have to be paid what they deserve to [earn] and not less, just what they really deserve. If it\u2019s just as popular as the men, they will get it, because the income and the advertising will go into that. But it\u2019s not like that, so why do they have to earn the same? I think it\u2019s ridiculous. I don\u2019t understand that.\u201d</p> <p>De Boer believes the move is a reaction to wider problems in society, where he does believe in equal pay. \u201cI think it started because a woman [was] getting underpaid, especially at [managerial] positions,\u201d he says. \u201cThey have to earn the same as a man. I think if you have a manager position for a bank or something, you have to earn the same what the men did because it\u2019s not physically, just only here [points to head], so why do you have to earn less, because you\u2019re doing the same job as a man? I think that\u2019s also dropped a little bit into the sports world, like tennis and soccer. But I think that\u2019s still different.\u201d</p> <p>Since departing Europe for America, De Boer has had a close look at the United States as a burgeoning football country, its potential and what is holding it back. He says it is important for more senior American players to make inroads abroad.

      "bodyText": "\u201cThey think that, if they give up on this, it\u2019s a noose for them,\u201d says Maryam Shojaei. \u201cPeople will ask for more. If they give in in one area, they fear they will have to give in in others.\u201d \u201cThey\u201d are the Iranian authorities and Iranian Football Association, who have thus far resisted calls for the removal of the 40-year ban on women in football stadiums. And Shojaei, who is the sister of the Iran national team captain, Masoud Shojaei, is one of an increasing number of women campaigning for entry: some have attempted to sneak into matches disguised as men, female sports photographers have had to scale buildings nearby just to do their jobs, and others have suffered brutal arrests and detention. For five years Shojaei has, without the knowledge of her brother, travelled the world following the top-ranked Asian team (23rd in the Fifa world rankings) with banners in tow highlighting the oppressive ban \u2013 including at Iran\u2019s 2018 World Cup group games. \u201cI watched the Brazil World Cup in 2014 and I saw many people and many women from Iran watching. That\u2019s when I thought that I had to do something,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought that I could do something about it because it\u2019s not a law.\u201d Her brother has also been vocal in support of women in the stands. Two years ago, in a video shared by Radio Farda, he said: \u201cI think if [the ban is lifted] we would have to build a stadium that could hold 200,000 spectators, because we see the flood of passion from our ladies.\u201d The ban is not written anywhere, it was never introduced, as such, instead creeping in as the political Islam of Ayatollah Khomeini took control of the 1979 revolution, birthed the Islamic Republic of Iran and tightened its grip on a country in turmoil. \u201cWhen the revolution happened the whole country was chaotic, the universities were closed, after almost two years the hijab became mandatory and then the Iran-Iraq war happened. Step by step there were just no women inside stadiums,\u201d says Shojaei, who has Canadian citizenship Times, though, have changed and the backward rule no longer \u201cfits with the character of the country\u201d, she says. \u201cI think they wish they didn\u2019t have it from the beginning because it doesn\u2019t fit with the culture. It\u2019s become a civil practice and they know that, if they give up on this, people will ask for more.\u201d What would \u201cmore\u201d be? \u201cOther issues around women\u2019s rights. For example, women don\u2019t have custody of their children. But these things are in the constitution and harder to change.\u201d At the same time she jokes Fifa probably \u201cwish they had never brought in their human rights reform\u201d \u2013 a landmark policy that commits the organisation to the UN\u2019s Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights including enshrining \u201cupholding the inherent dignity and equal rights of everyone affected by its activities\u201d in its constitution. Two months after a complaint over the ban was submitted to the Fifa ethics committee in April, signed by Shojaei, the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, wrote a letter to the Iranian FA president Mehdi Taj describing a U-turn on the rule change, after a small group of female fans were allowed into a match in Tehran\u2019s Azadi stadium in November, as \u201cdisappointing\u201d.

He was speaking after meeting Boris Johnson and senior British officials in London on Monday.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe ultimate end result is a comprehensive trade agreement covering all trading goods and services,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cBut to get to that you could do it sector by sector, and you can do it in a modular fashion. In other words, you can carve out some areas where it might be possible to reach a bilateral agreement very quickly, very straightforwardly.\u201d</p> \n<p>In other areas, such as financial services, he said deals might be more difficult to reach.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/02/us-wants-access-to-nhs-in-post-brexit-deal-ambassador-to-uk-says\">US wants access to NHS in post-Brexit deal, says Trump ally</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It is the first time the US has suggested smaller deals could be reached before a comprehensive agreement, and underlines its stance towards the UK as it faces the potential consequences of trade barriers being raised with the EU, the UK\u2019s largest export market. Previously, the US has resisted sectoral deals with the EU.</p> \n<p>Bolton, in a briefing with reporters, repeatedly underlined the US administration\u2019s Eurosceptic tendencies by saying he and Trump were \u201cleavers before there were leavers\u201d. \u201cIf there was a no-deal Brexit, that would be a decision of the British government. We would support it enthusiastically,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>His chief message on the trip, Bolton continued, was to convey Trump\u2019s desire to see a successful British exit from the EU, adding: \u201cWe are with you.\u201d The Johnson-Trump relationship, he said, had \u201cgot off to a roaring start\u201d with five phone calls since the British prime minister was elected leader of the Conservative party 18 days ago.</p> \n<p>\u201cBritain\u2019s success in successfully exiting the European Union will be a statement about democratic rule and constitutional government,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cThat\u2019s important for Britain. But it\u2019s important for the United States, too. So we see a successful exit as being very much in our interest, and there\u2019s no quid pro quo on any of these issues.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked to expand on this assessment, he continued: \u201cThe fashion in the European Union is when the people vote the wrong way from the way the elites want to go, is to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/dec/11/eu-ireland-lisbon-treaty\">make the peasants vote again and again</a> until they get it right. There was a vote \u2013 everyone knew what the issues were. It is hard to imagine that anyone in this country did not know what was at stake. The result is the way it was. That\u2019s democracy.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"63d68d6d-3377-48ed-99ff-f614073fc0f2\" data-atom-type=\"profile\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Profile\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In March 2018 John Bolton, a longtime foreign policy hawk, was named as Trump\u2019s third national security adviser in just 14 months. Over a three-decade career in foreign policy, he has advocated frequent use of military force and disdained diplomacy and international institutions.</p>\n    <p>Before joining the Trump administration, he was best known for a brief stint as president George W Bush\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations \u2013 a body he openly sneered at. His role came to an end because the Senate would not confirm him.</p>\n    <p>Bolton has called for bombing both North Korea and Iran. Less than a month before his appointment by Trump, he penned a Wall Street Journal <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-legal-case-for-striking-north-korea-first-1519862374\">op-ed</a> making \u201cthe legal case for striking North Korea first\".</p>\n    <p>He seems to have played a key role in the collapse of the second Trump summit with Kim Jong-un in February, when he appeared to have drafted a maximalist list of demands for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/07/trump-kim-jong-un-summit-bolton-launch-site-activity\">all-or-nothing disarmament</a> that was presented to the North Korean dictator in Hanoi. A year of diplomacy ground to a halt with Kim, who had been expecting a more gradualist approach</p>\n    <p>Bolton was a harsh critic of the Iran nuclear deal, which Trump pulled out of, and went further, advocating military force against the country. A bombing campaign was the only way to stop Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, he wrote in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/26/opinion/to-stop-irans-bomb-bomb-iran.html\">another op-ed</a>.</p>\n    <p>Bolton has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/06/us-deploys-aircraft-carrier-and-bombers-after-troubling-indications-from-iran\">seized the initiative</a> in the fast-moving escalation of tensions with Tehran during 2019, spinning military deployments in the Gulf that were already in the pipeline as confrontational steps against Tehran, and reportedly irritating some in the Pentagon and intelligence agencies by putting a sensationalist spin on intelligence about Iranian military movements.</p>\n    <p>In the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/03/venezuela-protests-news-latest-maduro-uprising-that-fizzled-\">standoff in Venezuela</a>, Bolton was again centre stage, making himself the lead US voice for a failed effort at regime change in Venezuela in late April, producing a personal video appeal calling \u2013 in vain \u2013 on Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s top aides to defect. Behind the scenes he has urged a reluctant US Southern Command to come up with ever more aggressive solutions to Maduro\u2019s hold on power.</p>\n    <p>In the past he has also opposed the International Criminal Court in the Hague. As undersecretary of state under George W Bush, he <a href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/what-does-john-boltons-appointment-mean-icc-investigation-afghanistan\">travelled</a> around the world negotiating two-way agreements in which countries pledged not to send US officials to the court. He also forcefully opposed the UN security council referring suspected genocide in the Darfur region of Sudan to the court, though the United States ultimately sat out that vote and the referral went forward.</p>\n    <p>Bolton grew up in a working-class Republican family in Baltimore, and his first political experience was as a volunteer in the doomed 1964 campaign of Barry Goldwater, a staunch conservative from Arizona. He attended Yale University. Unlike many of his fellow students, he fiercely supported the war effort in Vietnam, but not to the point of taking part himself. He avoided the draft by joining the Maryland national guard.<br></p>\n    <p>&nbsp;Bolton held senior positions in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and the elder George Bush, and wrote a book summing up his views: Surrender Is Not An Option.</p>\n    <p>He is derided by critics as a warmonger, but <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/08/us/politics/john-bolton-trump.html\">defines</a> his own philosophy as \u201cAmericanist\u201d \u2013 a close cousin to Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d slogan \u2013 and is no fan of traditional carrot and stick diplomacy. \u201cI don\u2019t do carrots,\u201d he has said.</p>\n    <p>Trump announced on 10 September 2019 that he had fired Bolton, tweeting that \"I disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions, as did others in the Administration\".</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>He brushed aside suggestions, made by the US House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, that a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/31/brexit-mess-with-good-friday-and-well-block-uk-trade-deal-us-politicians-warn\">no-deal Brexit might endanger the Good Friday agreement</a> by reinstating a hard border on the island of Ireland. He said there was no threat to the agreement that he could see.</p> \n<p>Britain, he said, was \u201cnot going to crash out even if there is a no-deal exit. World Trade Organization rules apply. So we\u2019ve got lots of agreements, bilateral and some multilateral within that context, that can be used as models\u201d.</p> \n<p>On Iran and other security issues, such as Huawei\u2019s involvement in 5G networks, Bolton said the message the US wanted to convey was that \u201cthe US government fully understands that in the next 80 days the UK government has a singular focus on the Brexit issue, so that we\u2019re not pushing for anything on these broad and complex questions\u201d.</p> \n<p>However, he claimed the UK had agreed to go back to stage one on Chinese telecommunications company Huawei, an assessment not shared later by British officials.</p> \n<p>Lewis Lukens, who served as deputy chief of mission at the US embassy in London until earlier this year, said Bolton might publicly be saying the UK should prioritise Brexit but there would be pressure behind the scenes for it to \u201cget on board\u201d with American policy on China, Iran and trade.</p> \n<p>Jack Straw, the former Labour foreign secretary, described Bolton as \u201cfar right\u201d and said he was taking the \u201ccrude and vulgar view that might is right\u201d. He said the US would be making huge demands on Johnson\u2019s new administration in return for a trade deal.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is a highly transactional administration. Strictly business \u2013 you do not get something for nothing,\u201d he told the BBC\u2019s Radio 4 Today programme. </p> \n<p>Bolton said the UK had abandoned plans for a separate European maritime security force in the Gulf, saying it had instead recognised it would have to come on board with Operation Sentinel, a US-led maritime force in the Strait of Hormuz and the Gulf of Oman.</p> \n<p>In his last act as foreign secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/22/uk-to-seek-european-maritime-mission-to-counter-irans-piracy\">Jeremy Hunt had proposed a separate EU force</a>, but his successor, Dominic Raab, has said that such a force separate from US assets and surveillance abilities may not be viable.</p> \n<p>More broadly, Bolton saw a chance for the UK to leverage itself away from European foreign policy once it left the EU: \u201cIn terms of Britain\u2019s overall policy, foreign policy, by definition, once it leaves the EU on 31 October, it won\u2019t be bound by the requirement to seek the common foreign security policy with the European Union. It will be pursuing UK national interest as it sees them.\u201d</p> \n<p>An independent UK voice would lead to a stronger Nato, he predicted. \u201cThis is something that would be incredibly valuable for the United States and for the western alliance as a whole.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s national security adviser, John Bolton, has said Britain and the US could sign sector-by-sector free trade deals prior to a comprehensive agreement as a way of helping the UK cope with the consequences of leaving the EU on 31 October without a deal. Bolton said the microdeals, focusing on industries such as cars, could be negotiated quickly, and would receive overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress. He was speaking after meeting Boris Johnson and senior British officials in London on Monday. \u201cThe ultimate end result is a comprehensive trade agreement covering all trading goods and services,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cBut to get to that you could do it sector by sector, and you can do it in a modular fashion. In other words, you can carve out some areas where it might be possible to reach a bilateral agreement very quickly, very straightforwardly.\u201d In other areas, such as financial services, he said deals might be more difficult to reach. It is the first time the US has suggested smaller deals could be reached before a comprehensive agreement, and underlines its stance towards the UK as it faces the potential consequences of trade barriers being raised with the EU, the UK\u2019s largest export market. Previously, the US has resisted sectoral deals with the EU. Bolton, in a briefing with reporters, repeatedly underlined the US administration\u2019s Eurosceptic tendencies by saying he and Trump were \u201cleavers before there were leavers\u201d. \u201cIf there was a no-deal Brexit, that would be a decision of the British government. We would support it enthusiastically,\u201d he said. His chief message on the trip, Bolton continued, was to convey Trump\u2019s desire to see a successful British exit from the EU, adding: \u201cWe are with you.\u201d The Johnson-Trump relationship, he said, had \u201cgot off to a roaring start\u201d with five phone calls since the British prime minister was elected leader of the Conservative party 18 days ago. \u201cBritain\u2019s success in successfully exiting the European Union will be a statement about democratic rule and constitutional government,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cThat\u2019s important for Britain. But it\u2019s important for the United States, too. So we see a successful exit as being very much in our interest, and there\u2019s no quid pro quo on any of these issues.\u201d Asked to expand on this assessment, he continued: \u201cThe fashion in the European Union is when the people vote the wrong way from the way the elites want to go, is to make the peasants vote again and again until they get it right. There was a vote \u2013 everyone knew what the issues were. It is hard to imagine that anyone in this country did not know what was at stake. The result is the way it was. That\u2019s democracy.\u201d He brushed aside suggestions, made by the US House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, that a no-deal Brexit might endanger the Good Friday agreement by reinstating a hard border on the island of Ireland. He said there was no threat to the agreement that he could see. Britain, he said, was \u201cnot going to crash out even if there is a no-deal exit. World Trade Organization rules apply. So we\u2019ve got lots of agreements, bilateral and some multilateral within that context, that can be used as models\u201d. On Iran and other security issues, such as Huawei\u2019s involvement in 5G networks, Bolton said the message the US wanted to convey was that \u201cthe US government fully understands that in the next 80 days the UK government has a singular focus on the Brexit issue, so that we\u2019re not pushing for anything on these broad and complex questions\u201d. However, he claimed the UK had agreed to go back to stage one on Chinese telecommunications company Huawei, an assessment not shared later by British officials. Lewis Lukens, who served as deputy chief of mission at the US embassy in London until earlier this year, said Bolton might publicly be saying the UK should prioritise Brexit but there would be pressure behind the scenes for it to \u201cget on board\u201d with American policy on China, Iran and trade. Jack Straw, the former Labour foreign secretary, described Bolton as \u201cfar right\u201d and said he was taking the \u201ccrude and vulgar view that might is right\u201d. He said the US would be making huge demands on Johnson\u2019s new administration in return for a trade deal. \u201cThis is a highly transactional administration. Strictly business \u2013 you do not get something for nothing,\u201d he told the BBC\u2019s Radio 4 Today programme. Bolton said the UK had abandoned plans for a separate European maritime security force in the Gulf, saying it had instead recognised it would have to come on board with Operation Sentinel, a US-led maritime force in the Strait of Hormuz and the Gulf of Oman. In his last act as foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt had proposed a separate EU force, but his successor, Dominic Raab, has said that such a force separate from US assets and surveillance abilities may not be viable. More broadly, Bolton saw a chance for the UK to leverage itself away from European foreign policy once it left the EU: \u201cIn terms of Britain\u2019s overall policy, foreign policy, by definition, once it leaves the EU on 31 October, it won\u2019t be bound by the requirement to seek the common foreign security policy with the European Union. It will be pursuing UK national interest as it sees them.\u201d An independent UK voice would lead to a stronger Nato, he predicted. \u201cThis is something that would be incredibly valuable for the United States and for the western alliance as a whole.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>There is an episode in the first season of Broad City \u2013 the US sitcom about two twentysomething, weed-loving best friends \u2013 that involves an epic journey to pick up some post. In order to track down a parcel, co-protagonist Abbi must travel on an eerily empty subway before boarding a ferry populated solely by identical twins. Finally, she arrives at a cavernous warehouse, where a demon-voiced, yoghurt-smeared old lady called Garol refuses to hand over the package, sternly informing the now desperate Abbi that she does not possess the requisite ID.</p> <p>Frenetic and weird, this tale of lost mail possesses quintessential qualities found in Gen-Y comedy: it is unsettling (Garol\u2019s warehouse belongs in a horror film); it is absurd (Why all the twins? Why all the yoghurt?); and it is soundtracked by a scream of millennial angst. If 1990s sitcoms were characterised by sexually liberated pals cracking wise, and the 00s by docu-realist, workplace-based cringe comedy, this decade has been dominated by the sadcom, a strain of comedy-drama shuddering under the weight of personal hardship and the idea that actual jokes are largely unnecessary. But as the 2010s come to a close, a new wave is establishing itself: one that retains the sadcom\u2019s essential bleakness, but overlays it with surreal settings, chaotically strange plotlines and jokes that ring with an erratic absurdity.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlgZi1UHk_E\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VlgZi1UHk_E?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>If you wanted to trace the roots of this simultaneously silly and slightly alarming comedy, you\u2019d likely find yourself at the door of Adult Swim, the US network that has distinguished itself with programming that is startlingly, sometimes horrifyingly, absurd. What started with Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! \u2013 a disorientatingly awkward sketch show with deliberately poor production values \u2013 has flowered into a whole tonal universe. Latterday hits include Rick and Morty, The Eric Andre Show and Andre\u2019s new series, Mostly 4 Millennials.</p> <p>In recent years, this comic sensibility has infiltrated the mainstream. On Netflix, a similar \u2013 if less outrageous \u2013 sense of unsettling weirdness reigns. I Think You Should Leave With Tim Robinson is an assemblage of aggressively odd scenarios; BoJack Horseman explores trauma through the medium of a cartoon horse; while The Good Place combines wildly imaginative settings with both profound darkness (a quest to avoid literal hell) and untold silliness. A raft of web comedies push the genre even further: Kate Berlant and John Early\u2019s 555 combines eerie ridiculousness with bad special effects; cult kids\u2019 TV spoof Don\u2019t Hug Me I\u2019m Scared blends cryptic imagery and body horror; and Year Friends \u2013 created by comics including Liam Williams and Jamie and Natasia Demetriou \u2013 features shoddy computer graphics and bad-dream storylines about death and pregnancy.</p> <p>How did millennial comedy end up so disorientating, dark and strange? One explanation for all this un-realism is that it\u2019s a response to a world that has stopped making sense. Philosophical absurdism argues that the universe is inherently irrational \u2013 a perspective rendered particularly apt by the unpredictable political developments of the past few years. But there\u2019s something unique about millennials\u2019 lot that contributes to this sense of meaninglessness. In 2017, the Washington Post asked: \u201cWhy is millennial humor so weird?\u201d, positing the theory that as the economic climate has delayed milestones such as marriage, kids and home ownership, and external sources of meaning such as religion have faded away, life has started to feel unpleasantly rootless, something that is being reflected in a stranger, more chaotic form of comedy.</p> <p>Abbi Jacobson, who plays her namesake in Broad City, says the sitcom was partly informed by the precarity and sense of helplessness that she and co-creator Ilana Glazer experienced as young adults living in New York. \u201cOne of the first absurd moments that I can think of \u2013 and it was a pattern we did throughout, which we called a \u2018pop-out\u2019 \u2013 is a bank scene where my character does an illustration and makes $8,000,\u201d she says. \u201cSo when we walk into the bank it\u2019s in slo-mo; I\u2019m dressed in that homage to Missy Elliott.\u201d That wild response to having a decent amount in your account speaks to the insecurity that is the defining feature of Abbi and Ilana\u2019s lives, something that leads to extreme emotional peaks and troughs. \u201cBig things that happened in our lives that were incredible or really hard lent themselves best to these pop-outs,\u201d says Jacobson. \u201cThat\u2019s where the thesis of our absurdity would come from, it\u2019s us amplifying how we feel in that moment.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d9dd23019b1d75bce0fa5cde00c65ad32c14f8a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d9dd23019b1d75bce0fa5cde00c65ad32c14f8a/0_41_1760_1056/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Eric Andre Show\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Eric Andre Show.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tyler Golden/Adult Swim</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This sense that the world is constantly, and violently, shifting echoes the feel of the internet.

Other programmes, meanwhile, are incorporating this decidedly random strain of humour, unfettered by traditional joke logic, into their longer-form setups. It is why \u201cGarol\u201d is funny, and why she is covered in yoghurt. It\u2019s why in Year Friends, there is a character who for some unknown reason cannot go up stairs.

I can\u2019t tell what the line is.\u201d</p> <p>As those on the right wavelength (and, perhaps, in the right age bracket) will know, however, internet-shaped humour is also characterised by a straightforward silliness, machine-tooled to pierce the panic-inducing online news cycle. TV comedy is beginning to tread a similar line \u2013 mixing disruption with mindless humour to cathartic effect. Pelling describes himself as a \u201cbig fan of David Lynch but also just stupid voices\u201d. Jacobson says that she is proud Broad City \u201cwas always funny first\u201d at a time of sadcom domination. Between the TV landscape and disaster politics, this return to ridiculousness feels refreshing and necessary: by turning up the volume of the chaos of modern life to ear-splitting levels, millennial comedy has found a way to cut through the noise.</p>",

Joseph Pelling notes this quality in his web series Don\u2019t Hug Me I\u2019m Scared. \u201cSome people might find it funny and some people might find it genuinely disturbing. I can\u2019t tell what the line is.\u201d As those on the right wavelength (and, perhaps, in the right age bracket) will know, however, internet-shaped humour is also characterised by a straightforward silliness, machine-tooled to pierce the panic-inducing online news cycle. TV comedy is beginning to tread a similar line \u2013 mixing disruption with mindless humour to cathartic effect. Pelling describes himself as a \u201cbig fan of David Lynch but also just stupid voices\u201d. Jacobson says that she is proud Broad City \u201cwas always funny first\u201d at a time of sadcom domination. Between the TV landscape and disaster politics, this return to ridiculousness feels refreshing and necessary: by turning up the volume of the chaos of modern life to ear-splitting levels, millennial comedy has found a way to cut through the noise.",

      "body": "<p>Every morning at 7.30, I climbed the stairs at Manhattan\u2019s 86th Street subway station with a horde of others. Pushing past us down into the subway were kids in private-school uniforms and office types, all with their loafers and heels and buttery leather briefcases. Meanwhile, I followed the maids, the construction workers and the other nannies up to the street. <em>The working class</em>, I thought to myself, and the phrase buoyed me a little, waking me up after the long sleepy ride from Brooklyn. We were the invisible forces, the childcare workers and housekeepers, arriving just in time for our bosses to make their way to work. We were the foundation of that city.</p> <p>As a first-generation college graduate, I had never been anything but working class. Every job I\u2019d had involved some amount of waiting on people wealthier than I was, in restaurants, offices or their homes. On the Upper East Side, I\u2019d been hired to take care of a toddler. She was 18 months old, walking and very verbal for her age. I\u2019d already been nannying full-time for years, in other parts of the city, and I\u2019d sworn that this time I wouldn\u2019t get attached.</p> <p>Over the next three years, my mind wandered in new ways as I cut crusts off of countless peanut butter sandwiches and repeatedly read Richard Scarry\u2019s Cars and Trucks and Things That Go. I found myself wondering what it would be like to live the way the families I worked for did \u2013 to have a washing machine, designer heels, a doorman, a bank account containing more than $50. Sometimes I played a little game in my head as I pushed my toddler charge around the city in my frayed winter coat and cheap boots: I imagined myself as her mother.</p> <p>Though these fantasies filled me with guilt, I couldn\u2019t escape them. I was reminded of <a href=\"http://www.marcydermansky.com/bad-marie\">Marcy Dermansky\u2019s Bad Marie</a>, where the eponymous nanny effectively kidnaps the two-year-old daughter of her employer, but proceeds to take quite good care of her.</p> <p>I gobbled up books about nannies on my commute: from Lorrie Moore\u2019s witty and touching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/oct/03/gate-stairs-lorrie-moore-review\">A Gate at the Stairs</a> to<em> </em>Le\u00efla Slimani\u2019s<em> </em>dark and propulsive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/07/lullaby-by-leila-slimani-book-review\">Lullaby</a><em>. </em>I found myself drawn into things I would normally disregard.

I was addicted to the outsider\u2019s perspective.</p> <p>The year before I began working for this family, I had graduated from Columbia University with a master\u2019s in creative writing. Those two short years had been some of the best of my life, but left me $100,000 in debt. So I started nannying, because it paid marginally better than most of the copywriting jobs I was now qualified for, and I thought it would be less taxing, leaving me free to focus on my writing at night. In actuality, I was exhausted after long, often 10-hour days with children, and I still struggled to put aside enough money for my repayment plan. My student loans were growing every month and writing was slow and painful. I worried that it had all been a horrible mistake: school, my confidence in my artistic abilities, my hopes for a life that was entirely unlike the one I\u2019d been born into.</p> <p>\u201cLife isn\u2019t about money,\u201d my dad told me. \u201cOr your career.

      "body": "<p>Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who\u2019s the most acne-prone of them all? \u201cRHETORICAL QUESTION LOL\u201d I\u2019m thinking bitterly, staring into this week\u2019s device. HiMirror Mini Premium (\u20ac259 [\u00a3240], <a href=\"https://www.himirror.com/en-GB/eshop/product/HiMirrorMini\" title=\"\">himirror.com</a>) is a smart surface that analyses your skin, presenting a breakdown of wrinkles, red spots, dark spots, dark circles, fine lines, pores and roughness. Every day for a week I have been looking into this pitiless oracle \u2013 and the news is never good. I may have hidden depths, but my sallow is all too visible. The mirror keeps flashing up bits of rude advice, telling me to get more calories from peanut butter, or informing me my outer skin \u201closes moisture easily, as it is composed of the oldest and driest cells\u201d. Right to my face. It might as well be calling me Ol\u2019 Wonken Chops.</p> <p>In its favour, HiMirror is technically mesmerising. You line up your face to a virtual mask and it snaps a picture of you to analyse. The mirror is a mirror \u2013 unless you choose to magnify your face by x2 or a horrific x3, in which case it switches to a tablet-style camera in selfie mode. It displays weather and news snippets. (Deeply weird to be given <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/08/kashmir-communications-blackout-is-draconian-says-un-envoy\" title=\"\">the latest on Kashmir</a> when obsessing over your pores.) You can connect to Spotify and watch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/mar/08/glam-or-sham-are-youtubes-beauty-vloggers-selling-out\" title=\"\">beauty tutorials on YouTube</a>.</p> <p>I\u2019m a sucker for this kind of fluid futurism \u2013 and, unlike many overengineered devices, it works beautifully. When I turn it on, a purple sprite formed of bubbles winks at me, as if I\u2019m taking a wee break from reality. By default, the sides of the mirror illuminate in clear white, although they turn warm and orange if you select the \u201cMakeup studio\u201d option. You can even try virtual makeup effects using augmented reality.</p> <p>The interface is stunning. My face, however, is not. It\u2019s hard, being informed how rough you are on a daily basis, that you rate \u201cpoor\u201d for dark spots but \u201caverage\u201d for wrinkles. This information is tracked via projected graphs. The data is meant to indicate whether your skincare regime is working, which many people will love. As far as I\u2019m concerned, the mirror might as well be shouting: \u201cCome get some ham, Fatty Boom-Boom,\u201d first thing in the morning.</p> <p>It gets worse. The company also offers a suite of accessories with which the mirror can communicate \u2013 including the Smart Body scale (<a href=\"https://www.himirror.com/en-GB/eshop/product/SmartBodyScaleBM616\" title=\"\">\u20ac119, himirror.com</a>). \u201cYou are underfat and with little muscle,\u201d the mirror tells me after they have a little conversation. It flashes up a stick drawing of a man with a tiny arse. I have never been so insulted. It also claims I weigh 6st 12lb (44kg), which can\u2019t be right \u2013 the tureen of chilli I ate last night weighed about that \u2013 yet I spend two days walking around wondering if it\u2019s true. (In fact, I had the scale on a carpet, which threw off the reading. Proper readings, on a hard surface, reveal that I weigh just more than 10st and have 9lbs of bone; that I am slightly fat, 64% water and 8% nachos.

      "bodyText": "Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who\u2019s the most acne-prone of them all? \u201cRHETORICAL QUESTION LOL\u201d I\u2019m thinking bitterly, staring into this week\u2019s device. HiMirror Mini Premium (\u20ac259 [\u00a3240], himirror.com) is a smart surface that analyses your skin, presenting a breakdown of wrinkles, red spots, dark spots, dark circles, fine lines, pores and roughness. Every day for a week I have been looking into this pitiless oracle \u2013 and the news is never good. I may have hidden depths, but my sallow is all too visible. The mirror keeps flashing up bits of rude advice, telling me to get more calories from peanut butter, or informing me my outer skin \u201closes moisture easily, as it is composed of the oldest and driest cells\u201d. Right to my face. It might as well be calling me Ol\u2019 Wonken Chops. In its favour, HiMirror is technically mesmerising. You line up your face to a virtual mask and it snaps a picture of you to analyse. The mirror is a mirror \u2013 unless you choose to magnify your face by x2 or a horrific x3, in which case it switches to a tablet-style camera in selfie mode. It displays weather and news snippets. (Deeply weird to be given the latest on Kashmir when obsessing over your pores.) You can connect to Spotify and watch beauty tutorials on YouTube. I\u2019m a sucker for this kind of fluid futurism \u2013 and, unlike many overengineered devices, it works beautifully. When I turn it on, a purple sprite formed of bubbles winks at me, as if I\u2019m taking a wee break from reality. By default, the sides of the mirror illuminate in clear white, although they turn warm and orange if you select the \u201cMakeup studio\u201d option. You can even try virtual makeup effects using augmented reality. The interface is stunning. My face, however, is not. It\u2019s hard, being informed how rough you are on a daily basis, that you rate \u201cpoor\u201d for dark spots but \u201caverage\u201d for wrinkles. This information is tracked via projected graphs. The data is meant to indicate whether your skincare regime is working, which many people will love. As far as I\u2019m concerned, the mirror might as well be shouting: \u201cCome get some ham, Fatty Boom-Boom,\u201d first thing in the morning. It gets worse. The company also offers a suite of accessories with which the mirror can communicate \u2013 including the Smart Body scale (\u20ac119, himirror.com). \u201cYou are underfat and with little muscle,\u201d the mirror tells me after they have a little conversation. It flashes up a stick drawing of a man with a tiny arse. I have never been so insulted. It also claims I weigh 6st 12lb (44kg), which can\u2019t be right \u2013 the tureen of chilli I ate last night weighed about that \u2013 yet I spend two days walking around wondering if it\u2019s true. (In fact, I had the scale on a carpet, which threw off the reading. Proper readings, on a hard surface, reveal that I weigh just more than 10st and have 9lbs of bone; that I am slightly fat, 64% water and 8% nachos. OK, not that last one.) \u201cYou are standard,\u201d the proper readout reveals. \u201cWith little muscle.\u201d None of this is a healthy way for anyone to think of themselves. Body fat and basal metabolic rate may be interesting to gym bunnies, but should we care what our muscle mass, bone weight or water percentage is? You are not training for Tokyo 2020. You can like yourself without those numbers, or hate yourself when you are \u201cwinning\u201d. It is impressive how the scale reads body composition from only an electric current, but frankly it is too much data. Staring at the chasm between yourself and your beauty ideals won\u2019t bring you any closer to achieving them. If x3 magnification isn\u2019t enough, how about x6, or x160?

No offence to Vince The mirror and the scale both require a mains connection, which is just too much cable. I\u2019m falling over myself, but not to recommend this. Wellness or hellness?

An email from the Chinese university \u2013 which is jointly supported by the Hebei provincial government and the Chinese Ministry of Education \u2013 demanded details of the UTS staff who would teach the students in their fourth year. HNU said it was to fulfil accreditation requirements. The details included academic qualifications and professional experience, but also passport numbers and dates of birth. Several academics wrote to the UTS course co-ordinator, associate dean Professor Graham Nicholson, refusing to provide the details and arguing the demand from the Chinese university was an \u201coverreach\u201d. UTS sought Australian government advice and no passport details were provided. \u201cUTS did not provide any passport numbers, and only months/years of birth,\u201d a spokesman for UTS told The Guardian. \u201cIt advised HNU that Australian government advice is that passport information should only be provided when applying for visas or to immigration officials. This advice was accepted without question.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Also as part of the joint course, academic staff from HNU travel to Sydney to undertake \u201cshadowing\u201d programs of UTS teaching during lectures, practical classes and tutorials. \u201cBecause in their first three years they must complete UTS-accredited subjects taught in both English and Mandarin, UTS developed a program to support HNU academics to develop the understanding, capability and confidence to deliver these subjects,\u201d the UTS spokesman said. The HNU staff who shadow UTS staff are all qualified science academics, holding PhDs in areas relevant to the biotechnology degree, and having published research papers in those areas, the spokesman said. There is growing political and public attention on Chinese government influence within the Australian tertiary education system. Chinese students make up 29% of Australia\u2019s 622,000 international students. Beijing has been accused of being behind student surveillance networks across Australian universities, and campus protests in support of Hong Kong demonstrators have descended into violence \u2013 met by pro-Beijing counter-protests \u2013 in recent weeks. The Morrison government has said it would examine whether universities should have to declare relationships with Chinese institutions under foreign influence transparency laws after leaked contracts revealed Chinese authorities were granted control over teaching at Confucius Institutes on Australian campuses. The Confucius Institutes are joint ventures between host universities and a Chinese government entity, Hanban, that provides funding, staff and other support. Last week, university vice-chancellors from across the country were briefed by the education minister, Dan Tehan, and intelligence officers from the Australian Signals Directorate on cyber threats. The ANU was hacked by a foreign agent in June, compromising the personal details of thousands of university students and staff. Australian intelligence officials publicly said China was the likely origin of the attack, saying it was one of only a handful of countries capable of successfully pulling off the massive breach of 19 years of data.",

      "bodyText": "\u2022 A 21-year-old woman has been found dead and another 41-year-old woman taken to hospital with stab wounds after a man ran through streets in Sydney\u2019s city centre wielding a large knife. \u2022 At about 2pm police received calls about a man wearing a balaclava and wielding a large butcher\u2019s knife in the vicinity of King St. \u2022 Video footage showed the man leaping on the roof of a passing car at the corner of King and Clarence streets, waving a large butcher\u2019s knife and screaming to be shot and killed. \u2022 The man was subdued near Wynyard railway station by several passersby, including a man using a chair to protect himself and another man with a milk crate. \u2022 Police said the man had acted alone. He had attempted to stab other people but had been unsuccessful, they said. \u2022 Police believe the death and the stabbing rampage are connected, and that the 41-year-old was a random victim. \u2022 The man, who is 21 and from the western Sydney suburb of Marayong, is alleged to have stabbed the 41-year-old woman in the back at the Hotel CBD, at the corner of York and Clarence streets, about 2pm on Tuesday. She was taken to hospital and was in a stable condition on Tuesday afternoon, police said. Her condition was \u201ccertainly not life-threatening\u201d, and on Tuesday afternoon it was reported she was \u201crecovering well\u201d. \u2022 The second woman\u2019s body was found at about 3.15pm in a unit on Clarence Street. \u2022 The man was found with terrorist information on a USB drive, about mass casualty crimes overseas, including in North America and New Zealand. \u2022 He has no known links to terrorist organisations. \u2022 Police said the man had a long history of mental health issues, and they were investigating reports he absconded from a mental health facility in recent days. \u2022 He was known to police with but \u201chis history was unremarkable compared to the of gravity of the crimes he committed\u201d, Fuller said. \u2022 Some witnesses reported that the man had shouted \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d. Police said they were aware of the reports but had not \u201ccaptured that as an evidentiary base\u201d. Some observers said the man\u2019s pronunciation suggested he was unfamiliar with the phrase. \u2022 Traffic and public transport was disrupted throughout the city as police investigated. The Clarence Street entrance of Wynyard station was closed, as was King Street between Clarence and York. Some buses were diverted to nearby streets to pick up passengers. \u2022 On Tuesday afternoon police raided a house in Marayong, believed to be that of the man\u2019s parents. \u2022 It\u2019s expected the man will be charged with homicide and serious assault, and potentially \u2013 if it becomes a terrorist incident \u2013 there will be charges relating to that.",

It was also revealed that Johnson\u2019s chief of staff had cancelled all leave for Downing Street advisers until 31 October, further increasing already fevered speculation about the likelihood of a snap election in the aftermath of a no-deal Brexit. Meanwhile, fears that the UK could be heading for its first recession in a decade were stoked by grim official figures showing that the economy had contracted in the second quarter \u2013 and parliamentary resistance to the Johnson/Cummings plan stiffened. A cross-party group of MPs began working on a plan to thwart a no-deal Brexit on 31 October by forcing parliament to sit through the autumn recess, while Jeremy Corbyn wrote to the cabinet secretary saying a no-deal Brexit during an election campaign would be an \u201cunprecedented, unconstitutional and anti-democratic abuse of power\u201d.

The Institute for Government also warned that a no-deal Brexit now appeared increasingly likely given the lack of time to secure a new agreement and of opportunities for MPs to block it. Downing Street has said it expected the cross-party alliance of rebels to precipitate the parliamentary battle on 9 September, a week after MPs return from their summer break, and did not foresee any move from the EU27 until after that.

To an audience member sitting for Nanfu Wang\u2019s harrowing new documentary One Child Nation, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/02/china-population-control-two-child-policy\">China\u2019s former policy</a> of permitting one infant per family (later amended to two, in the event of a first-born daughter) comes across as frightful stuff, at times borderline dystopian. A western audience would be shocked to hear the elderly speak so nonchalantly on such morbid matters. But Wang wanted to reveal the banality of this particular evil, to show how history can warp the perspective of those living through it.</p> <p>\u201cBefore making this film, I had more judgment for the older generation, how they seemed to be closed-minded,\u201d Wang tells the Guardian over the phone, not 24 hours before Amazon puts her film in American theaters for the widest release of the film-maker\u2019s young career. \u201cAfter finishing production, going through the process of conducting interviews and looking at the propaganda material, I started to understand why an entire nation of people would behave a certain way. I have more empathy towards the way that they behaved and the way that they think. They\u2019ve lived their whole life in a society that discouraged or even punished citizens who thought independently.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/11/magic-meth-and-mayhem-behind-the-years-most-mind-bending-documentary\">Magic, meth and mayhem: behind the year's most mind-bending documentary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a sense, Wang took the one-child policy for granted in a negative capacity, just as her parents had taken it for granted as a way of life. It was a fact of the everyday for as long as she can remember; she was born in 1985, just a few years prior to her brother, meaning she was one flip of the genetic coin away from being left in a basket on the street. Wang grew up around the cheery murals championing the brave patriots contributing to the effort to stem overpopulation, and she began to see through them at a young age.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMcJVoLwyD0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gMcJVoLwyD0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>As she grew into adulthood, she put that facet of her past behind her, until two wrinkles of fate brought the one-child policy back to the fore of her mind. First, China revoked the controversial legislation in 2015, allowing happy couples to freely go forth and multiply. Second, Wang got pregnant herself, and instantly saw motherhood through fresh eyes. \u201cI remember just two weeks after I found out I was pregnant, how protective I became,\u201d Wang explains. \u201cI was super aware of the dangers that could potentially face my unborn child\u2019s safety and life. I wasn\u2019t a very fearful person, but I noticed how much I was afraid for the life I was carrying. It was around then that I started thinking about other women who couldn\u2019t protect their child, people who had to live every day under the fear of not knowing what would happen with their pregnancy.

      "bodyText": "Authoritarian states have a quiet, insidious way of dressing up the immoral in the dowdy finery of the bureaucratically sanctioned. To an audience member sitting for Nanfu Wang\u2019s harrowing new documentary One Child Nation, China\u2019s former policy of permitting one infant per family (later amended to two, in the event of a first-born daughter) comes across as frightful stuff, at times borderline dystopian. A western audience would be shocked to hear the elderly speak so nonchalantly on such morbid matters. But Wang wanted to reveal the banality of this particular evil, to show how history can warp the perspective of those living through it. \u201cBefore making this film, I had more judgment for the older generation, how they seemed to be closed-minded,\u201d Wang tells the Guardian over the phone, not 24 hours before Amazon puts her film in American theaters for the widest release of the film-maker\u2019s young career. \u201cAfter finishing production, going through the process of conducting interviews and looking at the propaganda material, I started to understand why an entire nation of people would behave a certain way. I have more empathy towards the way that they behaved and the way that they think. They\u2019ve lived their whole life in a society that discouraged or even punished citizens who thought independently.\u201d In a sense, Wang took the one-child policy for granted in a negative capacity, just as her parents had taken it for granted as a way of life. It was a fact of the everyday for as long as she can remember; she was born in 1985, just a few years prior to her brother, meaning she was one flip of the genetic coin away from being left in a basket on the street. Wang grew up around the cheery murals championing the brave patriots contributing to the effort to stem overpopulation, and she began to see through them at a young age. As she grew into adulthood, she put that facet of her past behind her, until two wrinkles of fate brought the one-child policy back to the fore of her mind. First, China revoked the controversial legislation in 2015, allowing happy couples to freely go forth and multiply. Second, Wang got pregnant herself, and instantly saw motherhood through fresh eyes. \u201cI remember just two weeks after I found out I was pregnant, how protective I became,\u201d Wang explains. \u201cI was super aware of the dangers that could potentially face my unborn child\u2019s safety and life. I wasn\u2019t a very fearful person, but I noticed how much I was afraid for the life I was carrying. It was around then that I started thinking about other women who couldn\u2019t protect their child, people who had to live every day under the fear of not knowing what would happen with their pregnancy. It was inconceivable for me to imagine living that life.\u201d Upon hearing that China\u2019s government had painted the draconian policy as a humanitarian success \u2013 it claimed to have struck the laws only because they had performed their desired function, not due to the harm they caused \u2013 Wang wanted to rewrite the narrative. She had observed the gaps that the Chinese state intentionally created in its public\u2019s awareness of the Tiananmen Square demonstration and the Cultural Revolution, and she didn\u2019t want to see young people losing touch with this particular shame. \u201cIn China, the narrative about the one-child policy was overwhelmingly positive, and China\u2019s influence has been growing outside of the nation,\u201d she says. \u201cThe narrative has traveled. A lot of Western media has adopted the Chinese authority\u2019s narrative, so hopefully, the film can provide a counter-narrative.\u201d One Child Nation spans the personal and political, alleging that the political doesn\u2019t get much more personal than when it\u2019s dictating what is and isn\u2019t allowed to happen inside your uterus. Wang started recording conversations with her parents and moved on to their contemporaries, learning how something as bureaucratic as federal mandates could have such a terribly intimate effect on those affected by them. \u201cI asked my mom what it was like for her when she was pregnant with me,\u201d Wang recalls. \u201cShe started telling me stories that I didn\u2019t know, things I sort of knew but didn\u2019t really remember or register.

They are too polite to drive past these people.\u201d</p> <p>Dale, Gibson\u2019s husband is another escort. As a patient makes her way from the lot to the front entrance, protesters peek through the gap in the black tarp, pleading for the woman to reconsider.

The song coming through the speakers is \u201cTwist and Shout\u201d.</p> <p>Each volunteer plays a role in keeping the chaos to a minimum, when they can.</p> <p>James Parker, Hancock\u2019s longtime partner, keeps an eye on the traffic in and out of the parking lot. Another morning, before patients arrive, Parker repaints the white parking spot dividers to mitigate potential traffic jams. When he told colleagues at his power plant where he spent his off days, they assumed he was picketing the clinic.</p> <p>\u201cThey only think it\u2019s admirable if you\u2019re protesting,\u201d he said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Each volunteer plays a role in keeping the chaos to a minimum, when they can</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Escorts would be unnecessary if not for the protesters who seem to match them shift-for-shift. A 73-year-old woman protester claims she was the first one to start protesting the Jackson abortion clinic more than seven years ago. Now, she tries to make sure at least one anti-abortion protester is covering the shift each morning.</p> <p>\u201cGood morning. How are you?\u201d another protester asks Hancock later one morning, walking toward the tarp-covered pink wall begging a patient to reconsider. Hancock can\u2019t help but respond: \u201cBetter before you got here.\u201d</p> <p>Spending so much time together, the escorts have gotten to know the protesters and which ones to worry about.</p> <p>One morning, Hancock and Gibson lean into their portable red chairs at the entrance of the lot, not worried about the trio in front of them. The 73-year-old protester can\u2019t scream very loudly, Hancock says. \u201c[Her friend] is loud, though,\u201d Gibson offers. Hancock points to a younger woman and labels her a \u201cscreecher\u201d. This mother, who has brought four of her children to protest, Hancock relays, has 10 children but they\u2019re quieter than their cousins, 14 in total.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f9129edc9c4384d0fe6fae1395c13c71e62504c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9129edc9c4384d0fe6fae1395c13c71e62504c1/0_190_6240_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kim Gibson (left) and Derenda Hancock discuss a strategy to shield clinic patients from Christian anti-abortion protesters behind them.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kim Gibson (left) and Derenda Hancock discuss a strategy to shield clinic patients from Christian anti-abortion protesters behind them.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Khushbu Shah/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThey\u2019re good kids,\u201d she added.</p> <p>Right now, the larger set is on a road trip with their parents.

      "bodyText": "Kim Gibson wore a pastel rainbow-striped vest with the words \u201cclinic escort\u201d in bold, black letters as she glanced over at the arriving white van. She was irritated by the sudden appearance in Jackson of more Christian anti-abortion protesters in front of Mississippi\u2019s lone abortion clinic. She watched as the vehicle pulled up, letting out two sisters. They dropped picket signs onto the Jackson sidewalk before their mother drove off to park. When she walked back with her teenage son, Gibson yelled: \u201cShame what you do to these children. Shame, shame, shame.\u201d The young boy held up a poster nearly as tall as himself, with a picture of an aborted fetus: \u201cThe wages of sin is death,\u201d it said. Gibson marched down the parking lot to turn up the song on the speakers in front of the clinic doors and Gwen Stefani lets everyone know she ain\u2019t no hollaback girl for the seventh time that day. It\u2019s part of the \u201cgoing in\u201d soundtrack \u2013 all upbeat songs \u2013 for patients arriving at the clinic. Another escort dances along, facing the protesters, trying to create a buffer between the protesters and women going in for state-mandated counseling sessions or procedures. Mississippi is the only state in the south with a lone abortion provider and attracts special attention from protesters. As a wave of states across the US, including conservative southern states like Mississippi, pass ever stricter anti-abortion laws, the role of such clinics has become ever more important. Mississippi is one of nine states to pass restrictive abortion bans. These all come as a reinvigorated evangelical right in the US challenges access to abortion. The bans are designed to place pressure on Roe v Wade, the landmark Supreme Court ruling that protected a pregnant woman\u2019s legal right to choose to have an abortion. And in order to function, there is one group of people the clinics desperately need: the escorts who help patients run the gauntlet of protesters determined to stop them having abortions. Here in this corner of Mississippi, they are the Pink House Defenders: nicknamed for the garish color of the Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization\u2019s exterior walls. All the escorts are volunteers. Most have full-time jobs and schedule work shifts around clinic days. They have been organized for more than six years by 60-year-old Derenda Hancock. Gibson\u2019s and Hancock\u2019s attention shifts quickly to new protesters, particularly one clad in a pink vest, motioning for a car driving up to the abortion clinic to roll down the passenger window. At first, the passenger hesitates but when the teen tugs at her pink vest, suggesting she works at the clinic (she doesn\u2019t) the passenger rolls down the window. A pamphlet is thrust into the car and the girl speaks to those inside: \u201cWhat did your baby do wrong?\u201d Frantically, Gibson motions to the car to keep driving. \u201cC\u2019mon, sweetie! \u201d Hancock sighed, rolling her eyes. \u201cThis is Mississippi. They are too polite to drive past these people.\u201d Dale, Gibson\u2019s husband is another escort. As a patient makes her way from the lot to the front entrance, protesters peek through the gap in the black tarp, pleading for the woman to reconsider. Using a tambourine, Dale tries to drown out the \u201csidewalk counseling\u201d, as protesters call their work. The song coming through the speakers is \u201cTwist and Shout\u201d. Each volunteer plays a role in keeping the chaos to a minimum, when they can. James Parker, Hancock\u2019s longtime partner, keeps an eye on the traffic in and out of the parking lot. Another morning, before patients arrive, Parker repaints the white parking spot dividers to mitigate potential traffic jams. When he told colleagues at his power plant where he spent his off days, they assumed he was picketing the clinic. \u201cThey only think it\u2019s admirable if you\u2019re protesting,\u201d he said. Escorts would be unnecessary if not for the protesters who seem to match them shift-for-shift. A 73-year-old woman protester claims she was the first one to start protesting the Jackson abortion clinic more than seven years ago. Now, she tries to make sure at least one anti-abortion protester is covering the shift each morning. \u201cGood morning. How are you?\u201d another protester asks Hancock later one morning, walking toward the tarp-covered pink wall begging a patient to reconsider. Hancock can\u2019t help but respond: \u201cBetter before you got here.\u201d Spending so much time together, the escorts have gotten to know the protesters and which ones to worry about. One morning, Hancock and Gibson lean into their portable red chairs at the entrance of the lot, not worried about the trio in front of them. The 73-year-old protester can\u2019t scream very loudly, Hancock says. \u201c[Her friend] is loud, though,\u201d Gibson offers. Hancock points to a younger woman and labels her a \u201cscreecher\u201d. This mother, who has brought four of her children to protest, Hancock relays, has 10 children but they\u2019re quieter than their cousins, 14 in total. \u201cThey\u2019re good kids,\u201d she added. Right now, the larger set is on a road trip with their parents. Hancock doesn\u2019t hold it against the children. She even gave the kids a list of sights to see as they make their way around the midwest and keeps tabs on them through their father\u2019s Facebook page. With the recent attention on anti-abortion bills in the south, anti-abortion protesters and women seeking abortions aren\u2019t the only ones showing up. In recent days, an older man from California joined the tight knit group, claiming he\u2019s a pro-choice lay minister. He himself would like to offer counseling options to women after they\u2019ve had an abortion, he tells the group. Frustrated by his presence, Hancock refuses. There\u2019s already enough religion being thrown around healthcare here, she points out. \u201cIt\u2019s just so much. Everywhere. All the time,\u201d Gibson said.",

They also said a controversial non-prosecution agreement agreed with Epstein\u2019s legal team during a previous case was unlikely to now shield any co-conspirators from prosecution.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe main fact that the head of the conspiracy has been lopped off or died does not negate the fact that [others] can be charged,\u201d said the longtime criminal defense lawyer Murray Richman.</p> \n<p>\u201cConspiracy is a secret agreement between two or more persons. They can focus on one person being the ringleader of that conspiracy but nevertheless, the other persons are involved in that conspiracy,\u201d Richman explained.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re all persons involved in the conspiracy and they\u2019re all persons that can be charged \u2013 each and every one of them,\u201d he added.</p> \n<p>Rebecca Roiphe, a professor of law at New York Law School and former assistant district attorney in Manhattan, voiced similar sentiments.</p> \n<p> \u201cThe fact that they brought a conspiracy charge indicates to me that they have other people in mind,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Indeed, numerous court documents point to others\u2019 potential involvement in Epstein\u2019s alleged crimes.</p> \n<p>The Manhattan US attorney\u2019s case against Epstein for alleged sexual abuse of minor girls as young as 14 includes charges of sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy. Language in the indictment alleges Epstein \u201cworked and conspired with others, including employees and associates who facilitated his conduct\u201d in luring girls to his Manhattan and Palm Beach homes between 2002 and 2005.</p> \n<p>Epstein\u2019s controversial non-prosecution agreement with the former Miami US attorney Alexander Acosta \u2013 under which he pleaded guilty to state prostitution charges rather than more serious federal crimes for allegations involving dozens of minor girls \u2013 also said \u201cthe United States also agrees that it will not institute any criminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein \u2026 \u201d.</p> \n<p>The paragraph then lists the names of four women and says its agreement is \u201cnot limited to\u201d these named parties.</p> \n<p>Ghislaine Maxwell, the British socialite and media heiress romantically linked to Epstein, has also been accused in civil litigation of recruiting Epstein\u2019s young victims \u2013 an allegation she has denied.</p> \n<p>Exactly how these others would fit into the investigation is unclear. Some may involve witnesses who were cooperating with investigators against Epstein \u2013 and whose cooperation is thus no longer valuable after his death \u2013 or they could be separate cases.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat we don\u2019t know is whether or not these third parties who were involved in the conspiracy were already working with the government, or whether they are indictments that were going to be brought later,\u201d Roiphe<strong> </strong>said.</p> \n<p>David Weinstein, a white-collar criminal defense attorney with Hinshaw &amp; Culbertson and a former federal prosecutor in Miami, said Epstein\u2019s death would not affect prosecutors\u2019 attempts to prove others participated in a conspiracy.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/12/jeffrey-epstein-william-barr-new-york-jail-prison\">Barr criticises 'serious irregularities' at jail where Jeffrey Epstein found dead</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s the same evidence, the same witnesses,\u201d Weinstein said. </p> \n<p>Epstein\u2019s death could actually lessen potential issues with evidence.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe evidence that they\u2019ve seized from him directly \u2013 the only person who can contest the seizure [as unlawful] could be Epstein, or somebody who lived with him,\u201d Weinstein said.</p> \n<p>\u201cNow that he\u2019s dead, he can\u2019t challenge that. All of that becomes fair game.\u201d</p> \n<p>\ufeffAs for Epstein\u2019s plea deal in south Florida 12 years ago, those interviewed were skeptical it would protect others from prosecution, since they weren\u2019t direct participants in this deal.</p> \n<p>\u201cHim being dead, the agreement is meaningless because the other parties are not party to the agreement,\u201d Richman said. \u201cThey\u2019re the third-party beneficiary.\u201d</p> \n<p>Possible co-conspirators\u2019 defense lawyers could still try using this deal to their clients\u2019 advantage, arguing that the protections agreed in the deal still exist and extend beyond Florida. But the success of such an argument is not guaranteed to succeed.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn a way, it\u2019s an interpretation of document. The thing is that, I don\u2019t know how these particular individuals would enforce an agreement they were not signatories on,\u201d Roiphe said.</p> \n<p>Possible co-conspirators\u2019 lawyers could make an argument that \u201cunder contract law, that the government is breaching a promise that it\u2019s made and that you have an interest\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think that\u2019s a stretch,\u201d Roiphe said, \u201cbut it\u2019s not an impossible argument to make.\u201d</p> \n<p>Accusers can also pursue civil cases against Epstein despite his death. In the US, litigants can sue deceased persons\u2019 estates in order to win compensation.</p> \n<p>The lawyer Gloria Allred, who represents some of Epstein\u2019s accusers, told the Guardian: \u201cWe\u2019ll file an action to vindicate their rights within the next 10 days.\u201d</p>",

In the wake of the billionaire\u2019s apparent suicide on Saturday morning, his accusers voiced anger and regret that Epstein would no longer face them in court \u2013 and called for authorities to continue their investigation into others who might have been involved in a trafficking ring that targeted young girls for sexual abuse. That call looks to have been taken up. Statements from authorities after Epstein\u2019s death indicated potential co-conspirators were not off the hook. William Barr, the US attorney general, said Monday: \u201cLet me assure you that case will continue on against anyone who was complicit with Epstein.\u201d He added: \u201cAny co-conspirators should not rest easy. Victims deserve justice and will get it.\u201d New York authorities have echoed that sentiment. \u201cTo those brave young women who have already come forward and to the many others who have yet to do so, let me reiterate that we remain committed to standing for you, and our investigation of the conduct charged in the indictment \u2013 which included a conspiracy count \u2013 remains ongoing,\u201d Geoffrey Berman, the Manhattan US attorney, said in a statement. Veteran attorneys interviewed by the Guardian said Epstein\u2019s death would not impede federal prosecutors from pursuing conspiracy cases against others. They also said a controversial non-prosecution agreement agreed with Epstein\u2019s legal team during a previous case was unlikely to now shield any co-conspirators from prosecution. \u201cThe main fact that the head of the conspiracy has been lopped off or died does not negate the fact that [others] can be charged,\u201d said the longtime criminal defense lawyer Murray Richman. \u201cConspiracy is a secret agreement between two or more persons. They can focus on one person being the ringleader of that conspiracy but nevertheless, the other persons are involved in that conspiracy,\u201d Richman explained. \u201cThey\u2019re all persons involved in the conspiracy and they\u2019re all persons that can be charged \u2013 each and every one of them,\u201d he added. Rebecca Roiphe, a professor of law at New York Law School and former assistant district attorney in Manhattan, voiced similar sentiments. \u201cThe fact that they brought a conspiracy charge indicates to me that they have other people in mind,\u201d she said. Indeed, numerous court documents point to others\u2019 potential involvement in Epstein\u2019s alleged crimes. The Manhattan US attorney\u2019s case against Epstein for alleged sexual abuse of minor girls as young as 14 includes charges of sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy. Language in the indictment alleges Epstein \u201cworked and conspired with others, including employees and associates who facilitated his conduct\u201d in luring girls to his Manhattan and Palm Beach homes between 2002 and 2005. Epstein\u2019s controversial non-prosecution agreement with the former Miami US attorney Alexander Acosta \u2013 under which he pleaded guilty to state prostitution charges rather than more serious federal crimes for allegations involving dozens of minor girls \u2013 also said \u201cthe United States also agrees that it will not institute any criminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein \u2026 \u201d. The paragraph then lists the names of four women and says its agreement is \u201cnot limited to\u201d these named parties. Ghislaine Maxwell, the British socialite and media heiress romantically linked to Epstein, has also been accused in civil litigation of recruiting Epstein\u2019s young victims \u2013 an allegation she has denied. Exactly how these others would fit into the investigation is unclear. Some may involve witnesses who were cooperating with investigators against Epstein \u2013 and whose cooperation is thus no longer valuable after his death \u2013 or they could be separate cases. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t know is whether or not these third parties who were involved in the conspiracy were already working with the government, or whether they are indictments that were going to be brought later,\u201d Roiphe said. David Weinstein, a white-collar criminal defense attorney with Hinshaw &amp; Culbertson and a former federal prosecutor in Miami, said Epstein\u2019s death would not affect prosecutors\u2019 attempts to prove others participated in a conspiracy. \u201cIt\u2019s the same evidence, the same witnesses,\u201d Weinstein said. Epstein\u2019s death could actually lessen potential issues with evidence. \u201cThe evidence that they\u2019ve seized from him directly \u2013 the only person who can contest the seizure [as unlawful] could be Epstein, or somebody who lived with him,\u201d Weinstein said. \u201cNow that he\u2019s dead, he can\u2019t challenge that. All of that becomes fair game.\u201d \ufeffAs for Epstein\u2019s plea deal in south Florida 12 years ago, those interviewed were skeptical it would protect others from prosecution, since they weren\u2019t direct participants in this deal. \u201cHim being dead, the agreement is meaningless because the other parties are not party to the agreement,\u201d Richman said. \u201cThey\u2019re the third-party beneficiary.\u201d Possible co-conspirators\u2019 defense lawyers could still try using this deal to their clients\u2019 advantage, arguing that the protections agreed in the deal still exist and extend beyond Florida. But the success of such an argument is not guaranteed to succeed. \u201cIn a way, it\u2019s an interpretation of document. The thing is that, I don\u2019t know how these particular individuals would enforce an agreement they were not signatories on,\u201d Roiphe said. Possible co-conspirators\u2019 lawyers could make an argument that \u201cunder contract law, that the government is breaching a promise that it\u2019s made and that you have an interest\u201d. \u201cI think that\u2019s a stretch,\u201d Roiphe said, \u201cbut it\u2019s not an impossible argument to make.\u201d Accusers can also pursue civil cases against Epstein despite his death. In the US, litigants can sue deceased persons\u2019 estates in order to win compensation. The lawyer Gloria Allred, who represents some of Epstein\u2019s accusers, told the Guardian: \u201cWe\u2019ll file an action to vindicate their rights within the next 10 days.\u201d",

At the very least, time spent thinking the world of someone \u2013 compared with cataloguing insults, say \u2013 boosts the morale. Devotion is a noble gear in which to navigate. Also, unlike other obsessive teenage behaviours, worshipping your teachers has a valuable side-effect: academic progress. Determined to please, you redo your homework until it shimmers.</p> <p>I remember my crushes like the kings and queens of England. The primary teacher, sporty and matter-of-fact, who presented me with a hardback notebook in which to write my poems. The A-level English teacher, with thick white hair like royal icing, who made us feel so trustworthy and mature with regular updates from her marriage guidance sessions. It was Miss M, though \u2013 clever, kind and witty \u2013 who arrived at our school in the nick of time for me.</p> <p>Miss M was correct and proper. I\u2019d had my fill of eccentrics by that stage. I loved her shipshape turns of phrase; I\u2019d never met anyone who said \u201cby and large\u201d before. She laughed at my jokes, asked what I was reading. She made free with her red ticks on the page. Once a week I allowed myself to say a bright \u201cgood morning\u201d as she climbed out of her sunny yellow Fiat at the exact moment I arrived at school. I hoped she would glimpse me in the playground sometimes, my nose deep in an extraordinary book. I was playing a long game.</p> <p>There is a rhythm and order to managing these feelings. It is acceptable to feel excruciated, unthinkable that the teacher might. My home life was quite wild then.

      "bodyText": "Ever the schoolgirl, at this time of year I like to stockpile thin grey V-necks and navy A-line kick-pleat skirts. I also look back with wistful romance to all the teachers I have loved. Crushes on teachers are meat and drink to wobbly pupils, hungry for approval, inspiration and praise. These attachments may provoke scorn in others, but they can be medicine for the harshness and competition of teenage life. Of course, such relationships can be open to abuse, but when they go well they are a safe place to try out risky feelings, a kind of education in themselves. At the very least, time spent thinking the world of someone \u2013 compared with cataloguing insults, say \u2013 boosts the morale. Devotion is a noble gear in which to navigate. Also, unlike other obsessive teenage behaviours, worshipping your teachers has a valuable side-effect: academic progress. Determined to please, you redo your homework until it shimmers. I remember my crushes like the kings and queens of England. The primary teacher, sporty and matter-of-fact, who presented me with a hardback notebook in which to write my poems. The A-level English teacher, with thick white hair like royal icing, who made us feel so trustworthy and mature with regular updates from her marriage guidance sessions. It was Miss M, though \u2013 clever, kind and witty \u2013 who arrived at our school in the nick of time for me. Miss M was correct and proper. I\u2019d had my fill of eccentrics by that stage. I loved her shipshape turns of phrase; I\u2019d never met anyone who said \u201cby and large\u201d before. She laughed at my jokes, asked what I was reading. She made free with her red ticks on the page. Once a week I allowed myself to say a bright \u201cgood morning\u201d as she climbed out of her sunny yellow Fiat at the exact moment I arrived at school. I hoped she would glimpse me in the playground sometimes, my nose deep in an extraordinary book. I was playing a long game. There is a rhythm and order to managing these feelings. It is acceptable to feel excruciated, unthinkable that the teacher might. My home life was quite wild then. My mother had struck up a romance with an antiquarian bookseller who would drink and pass out in a chair. A much-loved family member was in the grip of a heroin addiction and there were nests of syringes in the kitchen bin. I had never been even five minutes late for school. How could my life contain such different worlds? Homework played a key part in our economy of sympathy. My essays for Miss M were three parts please admire my acute sensitivity and one part Heeeeelp! Miss M\u2019s \u201cSmashing\u201d and \u201cWell done!\u201d represented little life rafts. A few years ago I looked up Miss M and we arranged to meet. I bought a bunch of hyacinths because, finally, I was allowed to. I told her that her cheerful belief in me had helped me stay afloat.

      "bodyText": "Morning Cries of \u201cCocco bello, cocco fresco\u201d carry intermittently across the beach as a coconut seller slaloms between rows of bronzed Neapolitans outstretched on sunbeds under a collage of coloured umbrellas. I am doing as the locals do in the fishing town of Santa Maria di Castellabate, two hours south of Naples. That is, I am sunbathing cheek by jowl on a beach, where phone calls, family arguments and sweet nothings are conducted publicly. For Italians, this vociferous atmosphere is all part of the appeal of the seaside. Unpretentious Santa Maria town sits astride wide, sandy beaches at the foot of the mountainous Cilento national park. The town is the newer counterpart to the more attractive Norman fortress town of Castellabate \u2013 a Unesco site and the backdrop for Benvenuti al Sud, a hugely popular comedy film that revels in the generous southern-Italian spirit. The seaside Santa Maria, nonetheless, is the preferred place to holiday for many Neapolitan extended families, who squeeze into rented apartments or second homes owned by multiple sets of cousins on weekends in July and over the two-week holiday in August when much of Italy shuts down. Each family holiday is played out in a routine that has been perfected over generations, and one which I \u2013 since living in Naples for several years \u2013 have been eager to embrace. At the beach, the neatly arranged rows of sunbeds dictate a social hierarchy, where the punters\u2019 wealth is ostensibly reflected in how close they are to the seashore. However, in the sea the social-economic divides dissolve. Wallowing at waist height in the water, I find myself embroiled in a lively debate comparing the quality of this season\u2019s water with previous years before the conversation moves on to recipes and then lunch. Rosaria Esposito, who lives in my neighbourhood in Naples and is in Santa Maria with her family, remembers the good old days: \u201cOur mothers used to cook huge dishes of o\u2019ruot o\u2019furn and puparuole \u2019mbuttunate [Neapolitan dialect for baked pasta and stuffed peppers] and the whole family would sit around a fold-out table laid out on the sand for a full multi-course lunch.\u201d She also recalls how next to the showers at the lido, ceramic sinks were provided to wash the plates and cutlery so everything could be taken home clean. Afternoon These days, lunch is picked up at the salumeria on the high street before heading down to the beach. The couple on the sunbeds next to me are opening panini stuffed with nutty mortadella and a plastic container of peeled figs. \u201cI love the smell of freshly applied suncream and sandwiches,\u201d says Amedeo Colella, a well-known Neapolitan food author and comic who has been coming here since he was a child. He loves being able to slip immediately into the daily beach routine. \u201cIt means we don\u2019t have to think, we can just relax,\u201d he says. After lunch, he and his wife will be heading home for their afternoon rest, nick-named la controra \u2013 the counter hour in local dialect. They expect to have to wake up their two teenage daughters, who will still be in bed following a night out in town with their summer pals. \u201cAt this rate, we might as well just book a place for two and we can rotate beds,\u201d Colella says half-jokingly, referencing a local urban legend implying that big Neapolitan families do just that. As the early afternoon approaches, the beach empties of families and a sprinkling of teenagers are left playing cards and drinking lemonada ice granitas at the lido bar. I join them, hot-footing it across the scorching sand to Le Bagnanti behind my row of sunbeds. Only a handful of tables are laid out on the whitewashed decking that overlooks the beach. There are a couple of traditional dishes chalked on a blackboard by the till \u2013 spaghetti alle vongole and impepata di cozze (spicy mussel soup), which I discover pairs perfectly with fiano, a light white wine produced in nearby Paestum. \u201cI like keeping things simple but also celebrating the abundance of this area,\u201d says Alfonso Ferruzo, the young local owner.

Industry sources have confirmed the grid\u2019s frequency has also fallen below 49.6Hz three other times in recent months \u2013 the deepest falls seen on the UK grid since 2015.</p> \n<p>The energy regulator, Ofgem, has demanded an interim report on the blackouts by the end of the week and a full technical report by early September.

About 131m cases of the sexually transmitted infection are diagnosed worldwide every year and there have been almost 220,000 new cases in England in 2019. Chlamydia can be treated with antibiotics, but the infection often has no symptoms and so many people are unaware they have it. It is described as a \u201chidden epidemic\u201d which, without treatment, can lead to fertility issues and an increased risk of HIV. The findings raise hopes that the jab could eventually be given at the same time as the HPV vaccine, which protects against certain cancers.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>More proof of climate crisis \u2013 </strong>Gases heating the planet in 2018 were higher than humans have ever recorded, according to findings by the American Meteorological Society and the US government.

The global annual average for carbon dioxide \u2013 elevated by activities such as driving cars and burning fuel \u2013 was 407.4 parts per million, 2.4 ppm higher than in 2017. Last year was the fourth-warmest on record since the mid- to late-1800s, while sea levels were the highest on record as global heating melted land-based ice and expanded oceans. Sea surface temperatures were also near a record high while the extent of Arctic and Antarctic sea was near a record low and glaciers continued to melt and lose mass for the 30th consecutive year.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Canada suspects died by suicide \u2013 </strong>The triple-murder suspects Kam McLeod and Bryer Schmegelsky killed themselves, police have said after autopsies.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Chaos loomed three times before Hello \u2013 Warren Murray shedding some light on matters this morning. The National Grid put Friday\u2019s chaotic blackout down to \u201cincredibly rare\u201d circumstances, but the electricity network has had three near-misses in as many months leading up to it. The Guardian understands that in every month since May there has been a \u201cfrequency excursion\u201d \u2013 a severe dip in the grid\u2019s frequency from its normal range of around 50Hz. On Friday the blackout was triggered when the frequency slumped to 48.88Hz. Industry sources have confirmed the grid\u2019s frequency has also fallen below 49.6Hz three other times in recent months \u2013 the deepest falls seen on the UK grid since 2015. The energy regulator, Ofgem, has demanded an interim report on the blackouts by the end of the week and a full technical report by early September. Here are the questions National Grid will be called on to answer. * * * Tuesday catch-up \u2013 Getting in early this week &gt; UK diplomats are under orders from Boris Johnson to start winding up their work in Brussels because of Brexit. Critics say it will estrange the UK from key decisions. Labour is looking at a rapid no-confidence vote against the PM in September. &gt; Graduates of English universities face an increasing debt burden as total interest on undergraduate loans doubles from \u00a34.2bn to \u00a38.6bn a year by 2024. Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, has repeated Labour\u2019s pledge to scrap tuition fees. &gt; There has been a fatal stabbing overnight in Camden, north London. Police were called to Munster Square at about 11.10pm and the victim was declared dead at the scene. No name or age has been released, and no arrest has yet been made. &gt; Hong Kong\u2019s airport remains disrupted with many flights cancelled amid continued protests against the Chinese Communist party\u2019s control of the territory. Carrie Lam, Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, has said it is headed down a \u201cpath of no return\u201d . &gt; We have rounded up the best jokes from this year\u2019s Edinburgh festival. The Briefing\u2019s picks: the one about free-range chicken, followed closely by estate agent. * * * Chlamydia shot works \u2013 The first ever vaccine against chlamydia has been deemed safe in a clinical trial. About 131m cases of the sexually transmitted infection are diagnosed worldwide every year and there have been almost 220,000 new cases in England in 2019. Chlamydia can be treated with antibiotics, but the infection often has no symptoms and so many people are unaware they have it. It is described as a \u201chidden epidemic\u201d which, without treatment, can lead to fertility issues and an increased risk of HIV. The findings raise hopes that the jab could eventually be given at the same time as the HPV vaccine, which protects against certain cancers. * * * More proof of climate crisis \u2013 Gases heating the planet in 2018 were higher than humans have ever recorded, according to findings by the American Meteorological Society and the US government. Greenhouse gas levels exceeded 60 years of modern measurements and 800,000 years of ice core data, according to data collected by more than 470 scientists in 60 countries. The global annual average for carbon dioxide \u2013 elevated by activities such as driving cars and burning fuel \u2013 was 407.4 parts per million, 2.4 ppm higher than in 2017. Last year was the fourth-warmest on record since the mid- to late-1800s, while sea levels were the highest on record as global heating melted land-based ice and expanded oceans. Sea surface temperatures were also near a record high while the extent of Arctic and Antarctic sea was near a record low and glaciers continued to melt and lose mass for the 30th consecutive year. * * * Canada suspects died by suicide \u2013 The triple-murder suspects Kam McLeod and Bryer Schmegelsky killed themselves, police have said after autopsies. Their bodies were found in the bushland of Canada\u2019s Manitoba province after a weeks-long manhunt. They are blamed for the deaths of American Chynna Deese, Australian Lucas Fowler, and of Leonard Dyck, a Canadian botanist. Police are investigating a photograph of Nazi paraphernalia allegedly sent online by Schmegelsky. * * * Stink on the Northern line \u2013 If you are plunging into London\u2019s Kennington station today you might want to hold your nose. Mystery surrounds a strange odour that hangs in the air, described by some as smelling like sick, and by others as redolent of Burger King. In typical underground-ese, Transport for London said: \u201cWe apologise to customers who may have experienced an unpleasant smell at Kennington tube station recently. We are investigating the cause and will work to remove it as quickly as we can.\u201d Today in Focus podcast: Crisis in Kashmir Azhar Farooq and Vidhi Doshi report on the consequences of the Indian government\u2019s decision to impose direct rule on Kashmir from Delhi. Plus, Jason Burke on life in post-Mugabe Zimbabwe. Lunchtime read: High stakes of remain game A week after Britain voted to leave the European Union, tens of thousands of people massed in Parliament Square \u2013 draped in the EU flag or wearing it as warpaint on their faces. \u201cA new movement had been born: remainism,\u201d writes Daniel Cohen. \u201cRemainists feel embattled, ignored; they lament what their country has become \u2013 the kinds of sentiments more usually associated with leavers. \u201cThey used to pride themselves on their moderation; now, spurred on by rage, they divide the world into enemies and allies. What they are doing is loud, obsessive, tribal, confrontational \u2013 politics, in other words. Their fundamental demand \u2013 stopping Brexit \u2013 is now firmly in the mainstream. But with Boris Johnson in No.10 and 31 October approaching, the remainists are running out of time.\u201d Separately, John Denham argues that for the sake of Britain\u2019s own union, the \u201cEnglish interest\u201d needs to be separated from ugly English nationalism. \u201cEnglish-identifying voters are the least satisfied with their political representation and are unlikely to feel Westminster understands them. They want English laws made by English MPs, and many would like a parliament for England. Certainly, if the union is to survive, English voters need to be convinced of its modern relevance just as much as voters in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\u201d Sport Eddie Jones has admitted he is powerless to stop England\u2019s problem with off-field indiscipline after omitting Ben Te\u2019o from his World Cup squad following his altercation with Mike Brown at a recent training camp in Treviso. England paceman Jofra Archer has insisted on the eve of his Test debut at Lord\u2019s on Wednesday that he is ready for the five-day challenge and warned Australia not to doubt his stamina. Anthony Joshua is \u201cvery comfortable\u201d with staging his heavyweight title rematch against Andy Ruiz Jr in Saudi Arabia, despite growing criticism from human rights organisations, and does not believe it will damage his reputation, his manager Eddie Hearn has said. The rocky alliance between Suzann Pettersen and the Solheim Cup continues after the Norwegian was surprisingly handed a wildcard pick for the European team seeking to win back the trophy next month at Gleneagles. Andy Murray\u2019s return to singles action after a seven-month absence ended in defeat in Cincinnati and the 32-year-old confirmed he would not consider playing singles at the US Open. And barely two weeks after winning $3m at the Fortnite World Cup, Kyle \u201cBugha\u201d Giersdorf was \u201cswatted\u201d in the middle of a livestreaming session. Business Asian stock markets have followed Wall Street lower amid anxiety the US-Chinese trade war will hurt already slowing global economic growth. Meanwhile investors were rattled by a Chinese government statement saying protests in Hong Kong showed signs of \u201cterrorism\u201d. Beijing\u2019s use of the term terrorism \u201ctriggered a wave of risk aversion across global markets,\u201d said a VM Markets report.

      "body": "<p>Friday night in Edinburgh and a troupe of transgender Thai showgirls and their kilted male friends \u2013 plus <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jamiejohn4u?lang=en\">Jamie John</a>, a self-described gay dwarf \u2013 are onstage in highland regalia swaying to The Bonnie Banks o\u2019 Loch Lomond, the words of which are being enthusiastically bellowed by the audience. Part wedding reception, part concert, part cabaret, but with a potent flavour all of its own, this Saltire-flying extravaganza is the climax of the latest show by <a href=\"https://www.ladyboysofbangkok.co.uk/\">The Lady Boys of Bangkok</a>, who made their debut in Edinburgh 21 years ago, and have been coming back every year since.</p> <p>While critics and much of the media have more or less ignored the Lady Boys, they\u2019re the biggest show on the fringe, drawing in a cross-section of local Scots. There are grans, family groups, hen parties and young couples tucking into wine and Thai food at tables in a sweltering big top; tourists and London hipsters however, are conspicuous by their absence. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the things of the fringe, you\u2019ve got to come and see it,\u201d says audience member Gary Erskine during the interval. Will he be going to see much other stuff? \u201cThis is pretty much it.\u201d</p> <p>So \u2013 at \u00a322.50 a ticket (and a tenner more in the \u201cplatinum seats\u201d near the front) \u2013 what keeps drawing in the fans? First, there\u2019s the glamour: 14 showgirls, the titular Lady Boys, who lip-sync to a variety of pop bangers dressed as famous divas \u2013 Kylie, Rihanna, J Lo, Whitney. \u201cIt takes femininity to a different level,\u201d reckons Angela Buchen, one of many fascinated female punters (on some nights, the crowd is 80% women). \u201cIt\u2019s a bit bewildering, that they\u2019re men underneath. It\u2019s actually phenomenal, trying to get your head around it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7ad1820c9dcf971e17dc8e06f828beba13efd72f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ad1820c9dcf971e17dc8e06f828beba13efd72f/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Behind the scenes \u2026 the Lady Boys of Bangkok minutes before curtain up.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Behind the scenes \u2026 the Lady Boys of Bangkok minutes before curtain up.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The lady boys\u2019 tucks \u2013 the ability to make the penis and testicles seemingly disappear when wearing tight bikini bottoms \u2013 are a particular wonder. \u201cIt\u2019s the tricks of the trade, that\u2019s all I can say,\u201d says John, who shares a dressing room with them. \u201cSeeing is believing!\u201d</p> <p>Then, making this an 18-certificate show, there\u2019s the sleaze. In scenes <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQNzLBTCEDI\">that call Alan Partridge\u2019s sexual fantasies irresistibly to mind</a>, there are three interludes in which straight Scottish lads are dragged, not entirely unwillingly, on to the stage and felt up by Decha Nuchangsing, a sturdy lady boy with a lecherous demeanour. \u201cThey\u2019re tied to a chair and he gives them rather an exotic lap dance, which nine times out of 10 the men enjoy,\u201d says John. Wearing a sequinned jacket, John also presides over a lewd Countdown parody in which the word \u201chappiness\u201d becomes \u2026 well, it doesn\u2019t take Carol Vorderman to work it out.</p> <p>The Lady Boys\u2019 main appeal, however, is a communal one. As a raunchy version of One Night in Bangkok set in a hostess bar (this is not a show that shies away from its roots in the Thai sex industry) turns into a Queen tribute in which the cis male dancer Arthur Dy Saensuk dons a moustache to perform as Freddie Mercury, the audience rises to its feet to sing along to Don\u2019t Stop Me Now. Then there\u2019s a shameless selection of crowd-pleasers including Sweet Caroline, This Is Me, YMCA and I\u2019m Gonna Be (500 Miles) by the Proclaimers. Staying in your seat is impossible; as I try to take notes a woman behind me grabs my arms and waves them around as the Lady Boys get stuck into Whigfield\u2019s Saturday Night.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c9a8a9f710f3aa7e8a91e719a32832d6445a7d9c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c9a8a9f710f3aa7e8a91e719a32832d6445a7d9c/0_208_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Behind the scenes with Lady Boys of Bangkok.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Seeing is believing\u2019 \u2026 behind the scenes with the Lady Boys of Bangkok.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With its unashamed embrace of cheesy euphoria, it\u2019s not hard to see why The Lady Boys of Bangkok will never be cool \u2013 and why they also manage to reach an audience not catered to by much of the fringe. Yet with a plethora of trans and non-binary performers finding their voices in Edinburgh, do the silent, miming Lady Boys seem like relics from another era? While the show has an LGBT cast, it was created and directed by the straight circus impresario <a href=\"http://www.gandey.com/#!/our-team/phillip-gandey/\">Phillip Gandey</a>, and is aimed squarely at a mainstream, heterosexual audience (\u201cThis is not a gay show,\u201d the Lady Boys\u2019 spokesman Tony Wilkie-Millar tells me firmly).</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to deny that the Lady Boys are being somewhat exoticised. Audience member Davey Nicoll has travelled to Edinburgh from Inverness to watch the act. \u201cEverybody knows what it is, but you come and enjoy it all the same,\u201d he says. So what is it? \u201cIt\u2019s chicks wi\u2019 dicks! It\u2019s curiosity, it\u2019s like PT Barnum, you know The Greatest Showman? It harks back to that for me.\u201d</p> <p>Gandey says that, while prurience may get some people through the door, it\u2019s the quality of the performance that counts. \u201cWhen we first put it on, curiosity was the only selling point, and that\u2019s still there, but that lasts 10 minutes. If it wasn\u2019t for the standard that these people perform at, the show wouldn\u2019t still be going. One of my most proud achievements is what the Lady Boys of Bangkok has done for transgender people in the United Kingdom. They were the butt of a joke 21 years ago and we\u2019ve made it mainstream. We did This Morning several years ago with Richard and Judy and when they introduced them on the show it wasn\u2019t \u2018This is a show about men trying to be women\u2019 they said \u2018We\u2019re welcoming one of the UK\u2019s most fabulous dance troupes.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e7760bf1501df9568b6acc0abd9bbe84ed41cb31\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7760bf1501df9568b6acc0abd9bbe84ed41cb31/1279_0_3932_4915/800.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Not entirely unwilling\u2019 \u2026 audience members join the troupe on stage.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Not entirely unwilling\u2019 \u2026 audience members join the troupe on stage.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Payne</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The day after the show, I sit down with two of the Lady Boys: Sonia and Bombay. In Thailand, lady boys are called <a href=\"https://pulitzercenter.org/projects/asia-thailand-transgender-discrimination-gender-kathoeys\">kathoeys</a>, and are regarded as a third sex. Sonia and Bombay don\u2019t have much English, but it\u2019s pretty clear from what they say that to be transgender in Thailand is to face discrimination and prejudice. Showbusiness is one of the few arenas in which they can be celebrated for who they are.</p> <p>Theoretically off-duty in dangly earrings, lipgloss and prom dresses, Sonia and Bombay still project megawatt glamour. This is how they dress all the time. Showgirls to their immaculately manicured fingernails, the pair look bored stiff when I try to engage them in gender politics, but come alive when I ask what divas they enjoy embodying. \u201cOf course, Kylie,\u201d says Bombay, who does a sensational re-enactment of the video to Can\u2019t Get You Out of My Head. \u201cShe is the most popular woman in the UK.\u201d</p> <p>In the programme, Sonia and Bombay are listed as \u201cMr Uten Pengsa-ard\u201d and \u201cMr Kornwarin Kaewjaima\u201d, which seems like a deeply retrograde act of misgendering. Nonetheless, the illusion \u2013 if it\u2019s even appropriate to call it that \u2013 of changing gender is central to their act.

      "bodyText": "Friday night in Edinburgh and a troupe of transgender Thai showgirls and their kilted male friends \u2013 plus Jamie John, a self-described gay dwarf \u2013 are onstage in highland regalia swaying to The Bonnie Banks o\u2019 Loch Lomond, the words of which are being enthusiastically bellowed by the audience. Part wedding reception, part concert, part cabaret, but with a potent flavour all of its own, this Saltire-flying extravaganza is the climax of the latest show by The Lady Boys of Bangkok, who made their debut in Edinburgh 21 years ago, and have been coming back every year since. While critics and much of the media have more or less ignored the Lady Boys, they\u2019re the biggest show on the fringe, drawing in a cross-section of local Scots. There are grans, family groups, hen parties and young couples tucking into wine and Thai food at tables in a sweltering big top; tourists and London hipsters however, are conspicuous by their absence. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the things of the fringe, you\u2019ve got to come and see it,\u201d says audience member Gary Erskine during the interval. Will he be going to see much other stuff? \u201cThis is pretty much it.\u201d So \u2013 at \u00a322.50 a ticket (and a tenner more in the \u201cplatinum seats\u201d near the front) \u2013 what keeps drawing in the fans? First, there\u2019s the glamour: 14 showgirls, the titular Lady Boys, who lip-sync to a variety of pop bangers dressed as famous divas \u2013 Kylie, Rihanna, J Lo, Whitney. \u201cIt takes femininity to a different level,\u201d reckons Angela Buchen, one of many fascinated female punters (on some nights, the crowd is 80% women). \u201cIt\u2019s a bit bewildering, that they\u2019re men underneath. It\u2019s actually phenomenal, trying to get your head around it.\u201d The lady boys\u2019 tucks \u2013 the ability to make the penis and testicles seemingly disappear when wearing tight bikini bottoms \u2013 are a particular wonder. \u201cIt\u2019s the tricks of the trade, that\u2019s all I can say,\u201d says John, who shares a dressing room with them. \u201cSeeing is believing!\u201d Then, making this an 18-certificate show, there\u2019s the sleaze. In scenes that call Alan Partridge\u2019s sexual fantasies irresistibly to mind, there are three interludes in which straight Scottish lads are dragged, not entirely unwillingly, on to the stage and felt up by Decha Nuchangsing, a sturdy lady boy with a lecherous demeanour. \u201cThey\u2019re tied to a chair and he gives them rather an exotic lap dance, which nine times out of 10 the men enjoy,\u201d says John. Wearing a sequinned jacket, John also presides over a lewd Countdown parody in which the word \u201chappiness\u201d becomes \u2026 well, it doesn\u2019t take Carol Vorderman to work it out. The Lady Boys\u2019 main appeal, however, is a communal one. As a raunchy version of One Night in Bangkok set in a hostess bar (this is not a show that shies away from its roots in the Thai sex industry) turns into a Queen tribute in which the cis male dancer Arthur Dy Saensuk dons a moustache to perform as Freddie Mercury, the audience rises to its feet to sing along to Don\u2019t Stop Me Now. Then there\u2019s a shameless selection of crowd-pleasers including Sweet Caroline, This Is Me, YMCA and I\u2019m Gonna Be (500 Miles) by the Proclaimers. Staying in your seat is impossible; as I try to take notes a woman behind me grabs my arms and waves them around as the Lady Boys get stuck into Whigfield\u2019s Saturday Night. With its unashamed embrace of cheesy euphoria, it\u2019s not hard to see why The Lady Boys of Bangkok will never be cool \u2013 and why they also manage to reach an audience not catered to by much of the fringe. Yet with a plethora of trans and non-binary performers finding their voices in Edinburgh, do the silent, miming Lady Boys seem like relics from another era? While the show has an LGBT cast, it was created and directed by the straight circus impresario Phillip Gandey, and is aimed squarely at a mainstream, heterosexual audience (\u201cThis is not a gay show,\u201d the Lady Boys\u2019 spokesman Tony Wilkie-Millar tells me firmly). It\u2019s hard to deny that the Lady Boys are being somewhat exoticised. Audience member Davey Nicoll has travelled to Edinburgh from Inverness to watch the act. \u201cEverybody knows what it is, but you come and enjoy it all the same,\u201d he says. So what is it? \u201cIt\u2019s chicks wi\u2019 dicks! It\u2019s curiosity, it\u2019s like PT Barnum, you know The Greatest Showman? It harks back to that for me.\u201d Gandey says that, while prurience may get some people through the door, it\u2019s the quality of the performance that counts. \u201cWhen we first put it on, curiosity was the only selling point, and that\u2019s still there, but that lasts 10 minutes. If it wasn\u2019t for the standard that these people perform at, the show wouldn\u2019t still be going. One of my most proud achievements is what the Lady Boys of Bangkok has done for transgender people in the United Kingdom. They were the butt of a joke 21 years ago and we\u2019ve made it mainstream. We did This Morning several years ago with Richard and Judy and when they introduced them on the show it wasn\u2019t \u2018This is a show about men trying to be women\u2019 they said \u2018We\u2019re welcoming one of the UK\u2019s most fabulous dance troupes.\u2019\u201d The day after the show, I sit down with two of the Lady Boys: Sonia and Bombay. In Thailand, lady boys are called kathoeys, and are regarded as a third sex. Sonia and Bombay don\u2019t have much English, but it\u2019s pretty clear from what they say that to be transgender in Thailand is to face discrimination and prejudice. Showbusiness is one of the few arenas in which they can be celebrated for who they are. Theoretically off-duty in dangly earrings, lipgloss and prom dresses, Sonia and Bombay still project megawatt glamour. This is how they dress all the time. Showgirls to their immaculately manicured fingernails, the pair look bored stiff when I try to engage them in gender politics, but come alive when I ask what divas they enjoy embodying. \u201cOf course, Kylie,\u201d says Bombay, who does a sensational re-enactment of the video to Can\u2019t Get You Out of My Head. \u201cShe is the most popular woman in the UK.\u201d In the programme, Sonia and Bombay are listed as \u201cMr Uten Pengsa-ard\u201d and \u201cMr Kornwarin Kaewjaima\u201d, which seems like a deeply retrograde act of misgendering. Nonetheless, the illusion \u2013 if it\u2019s even appropriate to call it that \u2013 of changing gender is central to their act. Wilkie-Millar says that if any of the Lady Boys transitioned fully, they would no longer be suitable for the show, the same argument that got RuPaul criticised for lack of inclusivity when he told the Guardian that trans women shouldn\u2019t compete on RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race. In this way, there\u2019s a lot about the Lady Boys of Bangkok that sits uneasily at Edinburgh in 2019, which aims to be as trans-inclusive as possible: cast lists come furnished with preferred pronouns, urinals are covered up in order to make toilets gender neutral. Nonetheless, Jonny Woo \u2013 who has been at the vanguard of the current boom in queer performance, both as a drag queen and co-owner of London venue the Glory \u2013 sticks up for the troupe. \u201cThe Lady Boys of Bangkok are coming from Bangkok, not Dalston, and I don\u2019t think we should put our current moral compass on a company that\u2019s coming from [a different place],\u201d he says. \u201cIf they choose to entertain straight audiences, it\u2019s up to them. Queer is in, the trans conversation\u2019s happening, but there\u2019s not just one voice \u2013 there\u2019s space for it all.\u201d What about the straight audience\u2019s preoccupation with their genitals? \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s much different from watching RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race,\u201d Woo says. \u201cThe transformation of a male identity into a female identity still fascinates and entertains, so to say, \u2018It\u2019s old school, it\u2019s not where we\u2019re at now\u2019 \u2013 there\u2019s tons of drag in Edinburgh now, but although we might add some politics to it, we\u2019re still playing with the transformation.\u201d Rather than politics, what the Lady Boys want to provide, says Wilkie-Thomas, is escapism. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to celebrate being alive and having fun.

But by the end of the show, the feeling in the room is of more than just acceptance.

The Lady Boys of Bangkok are at Theatre Big Tops, Edinburgh, until 26 August.",

How ready are ordinary companies? Here is one that contacted me. Calico Cottage is a family-owned firm in Haddenham, Cambridgeshire, making specialist chocolate and fudge in two factories employing 50 people. Nigel Baker, its managing director, is despairing in his attempts to prepare for a no-deal Brexit: Calico exports 20% of its produce to the EU and uses imported raw materials. Trading on World Trade Organisation rules means a 20% tariff will be slapped on to his exports, a price rise he\u2019ll have to absorb: he sells to Disneyland Paris and says customers won\u2019t pay the extra.</p> <p>Searching for what forms to fill, HMRC\u2019s list of codes has been impossible for his complex products, where the quantity and original source of each ingredient needs a separate coding. \u201cThe paperwork is crazy,\u201d he says. Each form has three pages, one needed for each of his 50 products with certificates of origin relating to ingredients from all over the world. \u201cThat\u2019s what the single market did away with in 1994,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Baker\u2019s post-Brexit transaction costs include paying a carrier \u00a3100 a time to fill out the right forms, and a customs clearance agent to check and process duty paper work: qualified agents are in short supply. The company and each of his staff need security vetting to get exports through ports with less checking, requiring him to hire a security vetting consultant too. \u201cI spoke to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/18/revenue-chief-quits-after-death-threats-over-brexit-warnings\" title=\"\">Revenue &amp; Customs</a> for details but they said, \u2018Look, we have had no indication what will be in place on 1 November.\u2019\u201d Baker is an experienced exporter, with an MBA from the London Business School, but the lack of information and the utter unpreparedness of government defeats him.</p> <p>Here\u2019s what makes Calico Cottage\u2019s story particularly alarming. Baker\u2019s MP is Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, with an office just down the road. Baker asked Barclay to come round and examine the forms, to view the impossible task with insufficient information from HMRC for products like his. In mid-June Barclay sent round an assistant who spent more than two hours trying to puzzle out just one set of forms. The assistant couldn\u2019t fathom the absent information but promised that Barclay would write a letter to HMRC for the missing details.</p> <p>For an insight into the current chaos, what came back two weeks later from HMRC to the secretary of state was a pro-forma letter as if written to any member of the public: \u201cDear Mr Barclay, Please accept our apologies for the delay in acknowledging your case. We aim to send you a substantive response as soon as possible. Yours sincerely \u2026\u201d HMRC is supposed to reply within a month, but the time is now very short \u2013 and how many thousands of other exporters are caught in this backlog?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"169222d22681d79ab085b80f4923cce22652132e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/169222d22681d79ab085b80f4923cce22652132e/0_269_7960_4777/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Gove at Warrenpoint Port, Northern Ireland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Gove at Warrenpoint Port, Northern Ireland: \u2018In case anyone dares express a doubt that the nation is 100% ready, a rapid rebuttal unit was launched by Michael Gove.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Faith/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Baker wrote a shirty letter to Barclay, \u201cas a loyal Tory voter all my life\u201d.

It\u2019s time consuming, HMRC is unhelpful and it costs a fortune to get the paperwork done. If this is your best model for Brexit try it yourself and then maybe even you and your Brexiters will think again.\u201d </p> <p>Calico Cottage already exports to Norway: if that\u2019s the government\u2019s best model for a future EU free-trade agreement, it\u2019s no substitute for the single market. \u201cYou have to fill out a paper form in triplicate with carbon copies, nothing online.\u201d</p> <p>Brexit is already affecting Baker\u2019s business as, short of warehousing, he tries to get all the Christmas orders out of the country and raw materials in before 31 October. Worse, prices are so unpredictable that suppliers such Tate &amp; Lyle refuse to sign a fixed contract for sugar, so are free to cancel at any time.</p> <p>Baker writes to his MP, \u201cVoters like me find ourselves with no political home.\u201d The frustration felt by so many in business erupts as his letter to me continues: \u201cWhat amazes me is that the Brexit secretary and his team did not have an answer immediately \u2026 Given they\u2019ve had three years, you can imagine that business owners such as myself are simply stunned at the incompetence of the politicians.\u201d</p> <p>The great \u201cready-for-Brexit\u201d sham paraded in Downing Street with all this \u201ctask and finish\u201d talk may be designed to convince EU negotiators that Boris Johnson is deadly serious about no deal. But Brussels knows it\u2019s all bravado.</p> <p>They too can hear the likes of Ian Wright, chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, saying Calico Cottage\u2019s experience is widespread. \u201cThe industry can never be ready,\u201d says Wright. \u201cWith so many possible eventualities, it\u2019s pinning jelly to the wall. There will be random shortages and unpredictable chaos. No commodity prices can be fixed. No one knows what haulage will cost, if queues or fear of visas make EU drivers refuse to come here. Some things will be fine, but some will be much worse than we think \u2013 the unknown unknowns.\u201d When it turns out that the Brexit secretary and his assistants are as clueless as anyone else, all this macho \u201cpreparedness\u201d looks absurdly shallow.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/12/boris-johnson-brexit-bravado-economic-pain\">Boris Johnson talks tough but still hasn\u2019t said what he\u2019s doing to get a Brexit deal | Poppy Trowbridge</a> </p> </aside>  <p>How ready are the regions?

      "bodyText": "Britain is battle-ready for no-deal Brexit, that\u2019s the message. Downing Street gave every department 72 hours last week to present watertight crash-out plans and woe betide any whose ideas blow up later, Dominic Cummings menaced. \u201cTask and finish units\u201d will stress-test each one: tremble at the military-style management speak. In case anyone dares express a doubt that the nation is 100% ready, a rapid rebuttal unit was launched yesterday by Michael Gove to kill off any \u201cmedia myths and half-truths\u201d, reports the Sunday Telegraph. It will stamp on such \u201cmyths\u201d as the BBC\u2019s report that dairy cows will need to be culled if produce can\u2019t be exported. Or similar warnings that unsalable sheep will be slaughtered when the door to 90% of the UK market slams shut on 1 November. The Cabinet Office, sounding like a Ministry of Truth, will \u201censure the public and business is not being alarmed by scare stories or falsehoods\u201d. But out there, business associations tell a very different story. How ready are ordinary companies? Here is one that contacted me. Calico Cottage is a family-owned firm in Haddenham, Cambridgeshire, making specialist chocolate and fudge in two factories employing 50 people. Nigel Baker, its managing director, is despairing in his attempts to prepare for a no-deal Brexit: Calico exports 20% of its produce to the EU and uses imported raw materials. Trading on World Trade Organisation rules means a 20% tariff will be slapped on to his exports, a price rise he\u2019ll have to absorb: he sells to Disneyland Paris and says customers won\u2019t pay the extra. Searching for what forms to fill, HMRC\u2019s list of codes has been impossible for his complex products, where the quantity and original source of each ingredient needs a separate coding. \u201cThe paperwork is crazy,\u201d he says. Each form has three pages, one needed for each of his 50 products with certificates of origin relating to ingredients from all over the world. \u201cThat\u2019s what the single market did away with in 1994,\u201d he says. Baker\u2019s post-Brexit transaction costs include paying a carrier \u00a3100 a time to fill out the right forms, and a customs clearance agent to check and process duty paper work: qualified agents are in short supply. The company and each of his staff need security vetting to get exports through ports with less checking, requiring him to hire a security vetting consultant too. \u201cI spoke to Revenue &amp; Customs for details but they said, \u2018Look, we have had no indication what will be in place on 1 November.\u2019\u201d Baker is an experienced exporter, with an MBA from the London Business School, but the lack of information and the utter unpreparedness of government defeats him. Here\u2019s what makes Calico Cottage\u2019s story particularly alarming. Baker\u2019s MP is Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, with an office just down the road. Baker asked Barclay to come round and examine the forms, to view the impossible task with insufficient information from HMRC for products like his. In mid-June Barclay sent round an assistant who spent more than two hours trying to puzzle out just one set of forms. The assistant couldn\u2019t fathom the absent information but promised that Barclay would write a letter to HMRC for the missing details. For an insight into the current chaos, what came back two weeks later from HMRC to the secretary of state was a pro-forma letter as if written to any member of the public: \u201cDear Mr Barclay, Please accept our apologies for the delay in acknowledging your case. We aim to send you a substantive response as soon as possible. Yours sincerely \u2026\u201d HMRC is supposed to reply within a month, but the time is now very short \u2013 and how many thousands of other exporters are caught in this backlog? Baker wrote a shirty letter to Barclay, \u201cas a loyal Tory voter all my life\u201d. He invited him to \u201ctry filling out the following form which is the government\u2019s \u2018easy path to exporting to Norway\u2019. It\u2019s time consuming, HMRC is unhelpful and it costs a fortune to get the paperwork done. If this is your best model for Brexit try it yourself and then maybe even you and your Brexiters will think again.\u201d Calico Cottage already exports to Norway: if that\u2019s the government\u2019s best model for a future EU free-trade agreement, it\u2019s no substitute for the single market. \u201cYou have to fill out a paper form in triplicate with carbon copies, nothing online.\u201d Brexit is already affecting Baker\u2019s business as, short of warehousing, he tries to get all the Christmas orders out of the country and raw materials in before 31 October. Worse, prices are so unpredictable that suppliers such Tate &amp; Lyle refuse to sign a fixed contract for sugar, so are free to cancel at any time. Baker writes to his MP, \u201cVoters like me find ourselves with no political home.\u201d The frustration felt by so many in business erupts as his letter to me continues: \u201cWhat amazes me is that the Brexit secretary and his team did not have an answer immediately \u2026 Given they\u2019ve had three years, you can imagine that business owners such as myself are simply stunned at the incompetence of the politicians.\u201d The great \u201cready-for-Brexit\u201d sham paraded in Downing Street with all this \u201ctask and finish\u201d talk may be designed to convince EU negotiators that Boris Johnson is deadly serious about no deal. But Brussels knows it\u2019s all bravado. They too can hear the likes of Ian Wright, chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, saying Calico Cottage\u2019s experience is widespread. \u201cThe industry can never be ready,\u201d says Wright. \u201cWith so many possible eventualities, it\u2019s pinning jelly to the wall. There will be random shortages and unpredictable chaos. No commodity prices can be fixed. No one knows what haulage will cost, if queues or fear of visas make EU drivers refuse to come here. Some things will be fine, but some will be much worse than we think \u2013 the unknown unknowns.\u201d When it turns out that the Brexit secretary and his assistants are as clueless as anyone else, all this macho \u201cpreparedness\u201d looks absurdly shallow. How ready are the regions? Just one example: I was talking to Bristol\u2019s dynamic elected mayor, Marvin Rees, about council budgets and cuts, when he spread his hands out in a kind of despair at the governmental neglect. \u201cAll I\u2019ve been given is a grand total of \u00a3210,000 by Westminster for our Brexit preparations.

The man swept her off her feet and treated her like royalty, which is why it took a while for her to notice how he had began to slowly violate her privacy: he took photos of her without her consent, demanded to know her whereabouts constantly, and grew furious when she would not respond to his calls. She broke up with him.</p> <p>He then tried getting into her apartment, sent her hundreds of threatening messages, and sent emails attaching photos of her in compromising positions \u2013 cc\u2019ing judges and lawyers she knew.

She soon discovered the harasser\u2019s identity after her associate dug through a PDF Francesca had received and found the name of the last person to edit it.</p> <p>Goldberg asked Francesca: \u201cDo you know a Juan Thompson?\u201d</p> <p>Francesca replied: \u201cHe\u2019s my boyfriend. Why?\u201d</p> <p>Thompson had been harassing Francesca in various guises, then acting as a comfort blanket in real form. Goldberg helped obtain protection for her client, then advised her to break up with him. He did not stop. Instead, he escalated his attacks for months, avoiding arrest and targeting her family \u2013 then he reported fake bomb threats using Francesca as the perpetrator. He was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/03/jewish-community-center-threats-juan-thompson-arrest\">eventually arrested</a>.</p> <h2><strong>An industry that can\u2019t be held accountable</strong></h2> <p>In 2017, Goldberg was representing Matthew Herrick, a client whose scorned former boyfriend used the popular gay dating app Grindr to harass him. This time, the ex had created numerous fake accounts with a call for sexual encounters using Herrick\u2019s face and location.</p> <p>What Goldberg calls \u201ca storm of horny strangers\u201d proceeded to harass Herrick day and night, sometimes getting aggressive. Some of the messages sent from the impersonating accounts indicated that the recipient need not take no for an answer, which created a serious threat of sexual assault.</p> <p>One avenue Goldberg took was confronting Grindr\u2019s refusal to act. Grindr\u2019s defence arose from US legislation, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (CDA). It <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/26/opinion/section-230-political-neutrality.htmlhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/26/opinion/section-230-political-neutrality.html\">grant</a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/26/opinion/section-230-political-neutrality.htmlhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/26/opinion/section-230-political-neutrality.html\">s companies immunity</a> from repercussions for what users post, since the companies are not viewed as publishers of the content. Goldberg believes this leglisation \u201cis the enabler of every asshole, troll, psycho and perv on the internet\u201d. Because internet companies are not legally bound to protect their users, Goldberg says, many of them don\u2019t.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2019/jun/22/the-rise-of-the-deepfake-and-the-threat-to-democracy\">The rise of the deepfake and the threat to democracy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She points out that services like Twitter and Facebook may have terms and conditions, but they\u2019re not enforceable. \u201cUntil terms and conditions are enforceable in court, I don\u2019t give a shit what these companies say are in them,\u201d she says (Goldberg is very liberal when it comes to swearing). The only available fix is for lawyers like her to \u201cbe able to sue the fuck out of them for product defects\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tylerkingkade/grindr-herrick-lawsuit-230-online-stalking\">After </a><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tylerkingkade/grindr-herrick-lawsuit-230-online-stalking\">moving through various courts</a>, the Grindr case was dismissed because of Section 230. \u201cGrindr had enabled and facilitated Matthew\u2019s abuse,\u201d she says. \u201cThey knew it was happening. They could have stopped the strangers showing up at Matthew\u2019s door. But legally they didn\u2019t have to do anything to keep Matthew safe because of the fucking CDA.\u201d</p> <p>This immunity given to tech companies, she believes, \u201cis a government handout to the one industry least deserving of it. Besides the gun industry, name me one other industry that can\u2019t be held accountable to people harmed by their product?\u201d</p> <h2><strong>The future of online law</strong></h2> <p>The law professor Danielle Citron, in her book Hate Crimes in Cyberspace, <a href=\"https://books.google.co.za/books?id=hnRyBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=%22It+captures+the+different+ways+the+Internet+exacerbates+the+injuries+suffered%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=svoSLm3kYc&amp;sig=ACfU3U14jV6Y0GNUJJHYVKaoipR2XTEYMQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi61_Xr3Orj\">notes</a> that the label \u201ccyber\u201d is important to attach to various malicious conduct. \u201c[It] adds something important \u2026 It captures the different ways the Internet exacerbates the injuries suffered.\u201d Letters can be thrown away, slurs dismissed \u2013 but the internet not only facilitates the act of harassment itself, it becomes a monument of harassment a victim must endure whenever they are online. It can also be witnessed by potential employers or family.</p> <p>\u201cRevenge porn\u201d victims suffer the most when their private images are disseminated throughout the net without their consent. Each posting requires individual takedown notices, which is time-consuming work.</p> <p>Goldberg\u2019s firm has removed tens of thousands of images from the internet, the majority of them being revenge porn \u2013 sexually explicit private pictures of someone disseminated without their consent. Some of them, Goldberg says, are doctored images of her clients made to look like they\u2019re naked.</p> <p>I ask her about <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/bjye8a/reddit-fake-porn-app-daisy-ridley?\">Deepfakes</a> \u2013 fake audio or video that can look extremely convincing. She tells me her firm saw the technology coming. With deepfakes, \u201cyou not only have innocent people imposed into videos of fake scenarios, but you also have guilty people that have new deniability when videos show them in real scenarios.\u201d</p> <p>However, with revenge porn, Goldberg and her colleagues have made enormous strides. Recently, New York <a href=\"https://nyassembly.gov/Press/files/20190228.php\">passed a law</a> criminalising the distribution of any image or video showing an identifiable person\u2019s genitals and other vulnerable areas without that person\u2019s consent.</p> <p>One issue remains: it only targets defendants who acted with the <em>intent</em> to harm the victims.</p> <p>Writing in the <a href=\"https://blog.harvardlawreview.org/evaluating-new-yorks-revenge-porn-law-a-missed-opportunity-to-protect-sexual-privacy/\">Harvard Law Review blog</a>, Citron and her colleague Mary Anne Franks note that while this would find footing in some cases like Thompson\u2019s, it is a shortcoming. \u201cPeople disclose private, intimate imagery of others without consent for a myriad of impersonal reasons,\u201d the professors note, \u201cincluding a desire to gain social status, to brag, to make money, for sexual gratification, or to provide \u2018entertainment\u2019.\u201d This means men like <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/is-this-the-end-of-revenge-porn\">Hunter Moore</a>, who profited off of revenge porn, could not be prosecuted.</p> <p>Goldberg says she\u2019s aware of the criticisms, but is glad nonetheless for the law\u2019s existence. It not only means at least there\u2019s now a deterrent, but that victims can take matters into their own hands. \u201cFor instance,\u201d she tells me, \u201cif law enforcement is moving too slowly, a victim can get an order of protection from family court. If the offender violates that, [the offender faces] an automatic arrest and the additional crime of violating the family court order.\u201d</p> <p>I ask Goldberg whether she thinks law students are being adequately taught when the internet is often relegated to its own separate subject in schools. She has a firm position. \u201cLaw schools that aren\u2019t infusing internet law into every subject are not preparing students for the present. It\u2019s not enough to just have a class called internet law. It needs to be worked into <em>all</em> courses.\u201d She notes the intersection of free speech law and Twitter harassment; human rights law and Facebook\u2019s link to Myanmar violence; criminal law and computer fraud.</p> <p>In the final chapter of her book, Goldberg advises a young law student to \u201cfind your biggest obstacle, that thing that makes you feel most powerless, and ask yourself, \u2018How do I fix this?\u2019 That\u2019s the fight you should devote your life to.\u201d</p>",

Goldberg believes this leglisation \u201cis the enabler of every asshole, troll, psycho and perv on the internet\u201d. Because internet companies are not legally bound to protect their users, Goldberg says, many of them don\u2019t. She points out that services like Twitter and Facebook may have terms and conditions, but they\u2019re not enforceable. \u201cUntil terms and conditions are enforceable in court, I don\u2019t give a shit what these companies say are in them,\u201d she says (Goldberg is very liberal when it comes to swearing). The only available fix is for lawyers like her to \u201cbe able to sue the fuck out of them for product defects\u201d. After moving through various courts, the Grindr case was dismissed because of Section 230. \u201cGrindr had enabled and facilitated Matthew\u2019s abuse,\u201d she says. \u201cThey knew it was happening. They could have stopped the strangers showing up at Matthew\u2019s door. But legally they didn\u2019t have to do anything to keep Matthew safe because of the fucking CDA.\u201d This immunity given to tech companies, she believes, \u201cis a government handout to the one industry least deserving of it. Besides the gun industry, name me one other industry that can\u2019t be held accountable to people harmed by their product?\u201d The future of online law The law professor Danielle Citron, in her book Hate Crimes in Cyberspace, notes that the label \u201ccyber\u201d is important to attach to various malicious conduct. \u201c[It] adds something important \u2026 It captures the different ways the Internet exacerbates the injuries suffered.\u201d Letters can be thrown away, slurs dismissed \u2013 but the internet not only facilitates the act of harassment itself, it becomes a monument of harassment a victim must endure whenever they are online. It can also be witnessed by potential employers or family. \u201cRevenge porn\u201d victims suffer the most when their private images are disseminated throughout the net without their consent. Each posting requires individual takedown notices, which is time-consuming work. Goldberg\u2019s firm has removed tens of thousands of images from the internet, the majority of them being revenge porn \u2013 sexually explicit private pictures of someone disseminated without their consent. Some of them, Goldberg says, are doctored images of her clients made to look like they\u2019re naked. I ask her about Deepfakes \u2013 fake audio or video that can look extremely convincing. She tells me her firm saw the technology coming. With deepfakes, \u201cyou not only have innocent people imposed into videos of fake scenarios, but you also have guilty people that have new deniability when videos show them in real scenarios.\u201d However, with revenge porn, Goldberg and her colleagues have made enormous strides. Recently, New York passed a law criminalising the distribution of any image or video showing an identifiable person\u2019s genitals and other vulnerable areas without that person\u2019s consent. One issue remains: it only targets defendants who acted with the intent to harm the victims. Writing in the Harvard Law Review blog, Citron and her colleague Mary Anne Franks note that while this would find footing in some cases like Thompson\u2019s, it is a shortcoming. \u201cPeople disclose private, intimate imagery of others without consent for a myriad of impersonal reasons,\u201d the professors note, \u201cincluding a desire to gain social status, to brag, to make money, for sexual gratification, or to provide \u2018entertainment\u2019.\u201d This means men like Hunter Moore, who profited off of revenge porn, could not be prosecuted. Goldberg says she\u2019s aware of the criticisms, but is glad nonetheless for the law\u2019s existence. It not only means at least there\u2019s now a deterrent, but that victims can take matters into their own hands. \u201cFor instance,\u201d she tells me, \u201cif law enforcement is moving too slowly, a victim can get an order of protection from family court. If the offender violates that, [the offender faces] an automatic arrest and the additional crime of violating the family court order.\u201d I ask Goldberg whether she thinks law students are being adequately taught when the internet is often relegated to its own separate subject in schools. She has a firm position. \u201cLaw schools that aren\u2019t infusing internet law into every subject are not preparing students for the present. It\u2019s not enough to just have a class called internet law. It needs to be worked into all courses.\u201d She notes the intersection of free speech law and Twitter harassment; human rights law and Facebook\u2019s link to Myanmar violence; criminal law and computer fraud. In the final chapter of her book, Goldberg advises a young law student to \u201cfind your biggest obstacle, that thing that makes you feel most powerless, and ask yourself, \u2018How do I fix this?\u2019 That\u2019s the fight you should devote your life to.\u201d",

By 2015, the National Service Animal Registry, one of several sites that sell ESA certificates, had registered more than 65,000 assistance animals. In the four years since, that number increased 200%.</p> \n<p>While not all spurious ESAs wreak havoc, some do \u2013 with serious consequences. In 2018, Delta Air reported an 84% surge in <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2019/05/29/an-emotional-support-dog-attacked-him-flight-hes-suing-delta-owner/\">animal incidents</a> since 2016, including urination, defecation and biting. Recent media reports of emotional support peacocks causing<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-42880690\"> pandemonium in airports</a>, comfort hamsters getting<a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/juliareinstein/spirit-airlines-hamster\"> flushed in a frenzy</a>, and dogs <a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2017/12/05/service-dog-causes-chaos-at-cats-performance/\">storming the stage during Cats</a> have further contributed to the sense that ESAs are an epidemic, part of a zoo where<a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2019/07/23/american-flight-attendant-bitten-emotional-support-dog-dallas-north-carolina-stitches/1808632001/\"> entitlement, biting</a>,<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/06/delta-passenger-blasts-airline-after-he-sits-in-dog-poop-on-plane.html\"> pooping</a>, and pretty much anything else goes.</p> \n<p>For people who do have genuine disabilities, the situation is becoming untenable.</p> \n<p>Ryan Honick, 33, whose service labrador, Pico, helps him with myriad daily tasks, says people on social media who <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RHillenga/status/810229485861765120\">broadcast</a> their fraudulent pets infuriate him. Not only can fake ESAs distract or attack working service dogs, but service providers who have been inconvenienced by bad behavior from an unruly pet often sour on accommodating all animals thereafter. (Delta Air, for example, recently banned all ESAs from flights over eight hours.)</p> \n<p>Despite having a federally protected service animal, Honick is often denied rides from rideshare drivers; he films these exchanges and keeps a running thread of them on his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ryanlhonick/status/1070342406929858564\">Twitter feed</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve had drivers ask me point blank, \u2018What happens when your dog defecates in my car?\u2019 I\u2019ve said, \u2018That\u2019s not how trained service dogs function,\u2019\u201d says Honick. \u201cPeople\u2019s perceptions get skewed because somebody brought in their misrepresented animal. And that makes it harder for people like me who have a legitimately trained dog like Pico, who\u2019s never caused any problems, because there\u2019s this wariness.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/08/spirit-airlines-emotional-support-hamster-flush-toilet-florida\">Student says she flushed 'emotional support hamster' after Spirit Airlines denied passage</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Honick advocates on behalf of <a href=\"https://www.cci.org/\">Canine Companions for Independence</a>, a not-for-profit group that assists people who require service animals to mitigate the effects of physical disabilities. He tries to educate others about the difference between service animals and ESAs, having found that the layperson often doesn\u2019t understand that a service dog is a $20,000 super-animal that can smell oncoming seizures or lead the blind, and currently an ESA is more like a pet who doesn\u2019t actively sabotage its owner\u2019s mental health.</p> \n<p>Both have their merits, but only one is the difference between someone\u2019s life and death.</p> \n<p>Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, only service animals like Pico have legal protections and the right to be with their owners in any space (airplanes and residential buildings have their own federal legislations recognizing both service animals and ESAs). Service animals can only be highly trained dogs or <a href=\"https://www.anythingpawsable.com/miniature-horses-as-service-animals/\">miniature horses</a> capable of performing specific tasks. Emotional support animals can be any species or breed. They need no formal training, making them much more likely to spontaneously go a bit Jumanji.</p> \n<p>It can be hard to know whether you\u2019re looking at a service dog or an ESA without asking the animal\u2019s owner, and even that can be tricky: you are legally only allowed to ask someone with a service animal two questions: \u201cIs that a service animal?\u201d and \u201cWhat task is it trained to perform?\u201d</p> \n<p>Nothing can stop people from lying, or exploiting others\u2019 confusion by using the terms \u201cservice animal\u201d an \u201cESA\u201d interchangeably. \u201cThe majority of folks who slap a vest on their pet have already crossed that line,\u201d says Honick. \u201cThe easiest giveaway is behavior. A trained service animal is going to behave unobtrusively and professionally. If those things aren\u2019t happening, odds are high the animal is fraudulent.\u201d</p> \n<p>For business owners wary of incurring a discrimination suit for kicking a llama out of their hotel bar, it often seems safer to just accommodate all assistance animals. Unchecked, fake and unfit ESAs continue to proliferate.</p> \n<h2>The anxious generation</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d71bf2b020ee397eecaf78450bb5d65c3a02b957\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d71bf2b020ee397eecaf78450bb5d65c3a02b957/0_0_6741_4045/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A golden retriever dog wears a service dog harness\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Some see ESAs as a way to self-medicate without spending the time and money on an official psychological assessment.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: FatCamera/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>At a glance, fake emotional support animals may look like a product of rampant entitlement, but they may reflect something more complex.</p> \n<p>The National Institutes of Health reports that \u201cstudies have found that animals can reduce loneliness, increase feelings of social support, and boost your mood\u201d, and any pet owner can confirm that having an animal companion is one of the most effective non-pharmaceutical antidotes to anxiety you can get.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, generalized anxiety was identified relatively recently as a mental health condition and is only tentatively understood, but its reported levels are<a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/millennials-most-anxious-generation-new-research-shows-917095\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/millennials-most-anxious-generation-new-research-shows-917095\">soaring across generations</a>.

But others see it as a way to self-medicate without spending the time and money on an official psychological assessment to confirm what they already know: that anxiety is affecting their wellbeing.</p> \n<p>Eliza (not her real name), 28, had no moral dilemma surrounding her decision to \u201cregister\u201d her three-year-old pomsky, Buzz (also a pseudonym), through a website that also sold her an ESA tag, dog vest, and certificate.</p> \n<p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been diagnosed with any psychological illness, but I feel as if I naturally have a great deal of anxiety and I find that having my dog around me most of the time greatly reduces it,\u201d she says. \u201cI see my pet as my family member; instead of a child I have a dog and I want to make sure he has the best quality of life.\u201d</p> \n<p>Yet deriving comfort from pets doesn\u2019t entitle anyone to special treatment, especially when it comes at the expense of disabled persons. And while anxiety is a difficult condition, its intensity falls on a spectrum; official ESAs are intended to aid those who suffer only from its most debilitating manifestations.</p> \n<p>Despite Rosie\u2019s good behavior, Nick\u2019s conscience eventually caught up with him, and he ceased flying with her masquerading as his assistance animal in 2017.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen I started flying with Rosie, it wasn\u2019t quite the thing that it is now,\u201d he says, noting he came to feel that too many people were trying to \u201cget behind the system\u201d with untrained dogs. \u201cSometimes you could tell the dogs were uncomfortable traveling, that they were scared, they were distracting real service animals, and at that point I didn\u2019t want to be part of it any more.\u201d</p> \n<h2>\u2018Not just any pet\u2019</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"094d2604-ad7e-4dc7-8ece-e831f9077c29\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NGJLRkZzKbM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The question is, short of relying on everyone\u2019s moral compass kicking in, how do we cut down on fraudulent ESAs?</p> \n<p>One solution could be a collective movement towards an increasingly pet-integrated society.

Until then, we\u2019re left with a failing honor system rife with confusion, selfishness, and profiteers.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>This article was amended on 13 &amp; 16 August 2019: to further clarify the difference between service animals and emotional support animals and to more accurately cite the proposals of the research of Boness.</p></li> \n</ul>",

While no governing body keeps track of the figure, a study from the University of California at Davis determined the number of ESAs registered by animal control facilities in the state increased 1,000% between 2002 and 2012. By 2015, the National Service Animal Registry, one of several sites that sell ESA certificates, had registered more than 65,000 assistance animals. In the four years since, that number increased 200%. While not all spurious ESAs wreak havoc, some do \u2013 with serious consequences. In 2018, Delta Air reported an 84% surge in animal incidents since 2016, including urination, defecation and biting. Recent media reports of emotional support peacocks causing pandemonium in airports, comfort hamsters getting flushed in a frenzy, and dogs storming the stage during Cats have further contributed to the sense that ESAs are an epidemic, part of a zoo where entitlement, biting, pooping, and pretty much anything else goes. For people who do have genuine disabilities, the situation is becoming untenable. Ryan Honick, 33, whose service labrador, Pico, helps him with myriad daily tasks, says people on social media who broadcast their fraudulent pets infuriate him. Not only can fake ESAs distract or attack working service dogs, but service providers who have been inconvenienced by bad behavior from an unruly pet often sour on accommodating all animals thereafter. (Delta Air, for example, recently banned all ESAs from flights over eight hours.) Despite having a federally protected service animal, Honick is often denied rides from rideshare drivers; he films these exchanges and keeps a running thread of them on his Twitter feed. \u201cI\u2019ve had drivers ask me point blank, \u2018What happens when your dog defecates in my car?\u2019 I\u2019ve said, \u2018That\u2019s not how trained service dogs function,\u2019\u201d says Honick. \u201cPeople\u2019s perceptions get skewed because somebody brought in their misrepresented animal. And that makes it harder for people like me who have a legitimately trained dog like Pico, who\u2019s never caused any problems, because there\u2019s this wariness.\u201d Honick advocates on behalf of Canine Companions for Independence, a not-for-profit group that assists people who require service animals to mitigate the effects of physical disabilities. He tries to educate others about the difference between service animals and ESAs, having found that the layperson often doesn\u2019t understand that a service dog is a $20,000 super-animal that can smell oncoming seizures or lead the blind, and currently an ESA is more like a pet who doesn\u2019t actively sabotage its owner\u2019s mental health. Both have their merits, but only one is the difference between someone\u2019s life and death. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, only service animals like Pico have legal protections and the right to be with their owners in any space (airplanes and residential buildings have their own federal legislations recognizing both service animals and ESAs). Service animals can only be highly trained dogs or miniature horses capable of performing specific tasks. Emotional support animals can be any species or breed. They need no formal training, making them much more likely to spontaneously go a bit Jumanji. It can be hard to know whether you\u2019re looking at a service dog or an ESA without asking the animal\u2019s owner, and even that can be tricky: you are legally only allowed to ask someone with a service animal two questions: \u201cIs that a service animal?\u201d and \u201cWhat task is it trained to perform?\u201d Nothing can stop people from lying, or exploiting others\u2019 confusion by using the terms \u201cservice animal\u201d an \u201cESA\u201d interchangeably. \u201cThe majority of folks who slap a vest on their pet have already crossed that line,\u201d says Honick. \u201cThe easiest giveaway is behavior. A trained service animal is going to behave unobtrusively and professionally. If those things aren\u2019t happening, odds are high the animal is fraudulent.\u201d For business owners wary of incurring a discrimination suit for kicking a llama out of their hotel bar, it often seems safer to just accommodate all assistance animals. Unchecked, fake and unfit ESAs continue to proliferate. The anxious generation At a glance, fake emotional support animals may look like a product of rampant entitlement, but they may reflect something more complex. The National Institutes of Health reports that \u201cstudies have found that animals can reduce loneliness, increase feelings of social support, and boost your mood\u201d, and any pet owner can confirm that having an animal companion is one of the most effective non-pharmaceutical antidotes to anxiety you can get. Meanwhile, generalized anxiety was identified relatively recently as a mental health condition and is only tentatively understood, but its reported levels are soaring across generations. The causes are frequently beyond our control, or feel like it (climate change, gun violence, financial stress) yet the responsibility to keep our mental health in check falls squarely on individuals. To feel passably well, we are told to exercise, get more sleep, eat wisely, and maybe snuggle a couple of corgis. Perhaps that\u2019s why millennials, \u201cthe anxious generation\u201d, are also America\u2019s largest and most enthusiastic demographic of pet owners, with a 2018 survey reporting that of the 72% of millennials who own pets, 67% consider them their \u201cfur babies\u201d \u2013 or part of their families. Surely, many people who get ESA certifications for their pets are selfishly motivated by convenience \u2013 they just want to bring their pets on to airplanes or into Starbucks. But others see it as a way to self-medicate without spending the time and money on an official psychological assessment to confirm what they already know: that anxiety is affecting their wellbeing. Eliza (not her real name), 28, had no moral dilemma surrounding her decision to \u201cregister\u201d her three-year-old pomsky, Buzz (also a pseudonym), through a website that also sold her an ESA tag, dog vest, and certificate. \u201cI haven\u2019t been diagnosed with any psychological illness, but I feel as if I naturally have a great deal of anxiety and I find that having my dog around me most of the time greatly reduces it,\u201d she says. \u201cI see my pet as my family member; instead of a child I have a dog and I want to make sure he has the best quality of life.\u201d Yet deriving comfort from pets doesn\u2019t entitle anyone to special treatment, especially when it comes at the expense of disabled persons. And while anxiety is a difficult condition, its intensity falls on a spectrum; official ESAs are intended to aid those who suffer only from its most debilitating manifestations. Despite Rosie\u2019s good behavior, Nick\u2019s conscience eventually caught up with him, and he ceased flying with her masquerading as his assistance animal in 2017. \u201cWhen I started flying with Rosie, it wasn\u2019t quite the thing that it is now,\u201d he says, noting he came to feel that too many people were trying to \u201cget behind the system\u201d with untrained dogs. \u201cSometimes you could tell the dogs were uncomfortable traveling, that they were scared, they were distracting real service animals, and at that point I didn\u2019t want to be part of it any more.\u201d \u2018Not just any pet\u2019 The question is, short of relying on everyone\u2019s moral compass kicking in, how do we cut down on fraudulent ESAs? One solution could be a collective movement towards an increasingly pet-integrated society. A small number of colleges permit pets in dormitories, a policy more could consider. Normalizing the presence of animals in more spaces may reduce the impetus for people to game the mental health system just to spend more time with their dogs. But the more likely and impactful fix might be a change in medical policy. According to Cassie Boness, University of Missouri PhD candidate and co-author of an article on tightening ESA regulations published by the American Psychological Association this month, the professionals who sign off on ESA letters need to adhere to a strict and standardized evaluation model. Her research proposes a four-point evaluation system developed to empirically ensure not only that the individual in question suffers from a psychological disability that impairs their functioning, but that the specific animal they want to certify both behaves appropriately to access the spaces where they are permitted and objectively improves their handler\u2019s symptoms. Boness and her colleagues hope their new regulations will be adopted and formalized by the American Psychological Association, but they expect backlash from scammers of all stripes. In fact, guidelines would help anyone who requires an assistance animal: \u201cAs we have more clear guidelines, ESAs will hopefully start to be more well respected, because not just any pet can be certified,\u201d says Boness. With stronger regulations in place, the dog days of dubious ESA certifications will be over. Until then, we\u2019re left with a failing honor system rife with confusion, selfishness, and profiteers. This article was amended on 13 &amp; 16 August 2019: to further clarify the difference between service animals and emotional support animals and to more accurately cite the proposals of the research of Boness.",

      "bodyText": "Plastic was the furthest thing from Gregory Wetherbee\u2019s mind when he began analyzing rainwater samples collected from the Rocky Mountains. \u201cI guess I expected to see mostly soil and mineral particles,\u201d said the US Geological Survey researcher. Instead, he found multicolored microscopic plastic fibers. The discovery, published in a recent study (pdf) titled \u201cIt is raining plastic\u201d, raises new questions about the amount of plastic waste permeating the air, water, and soil virtually everywhere on Earth. \u201cI think the most important result that we can share with the American public is that there\u2019s more plastic out there than meets the eye,\u201d said Wetherbee. \u201cIt\u2019s in the rain, it\u2019s in the snow. It\u2019s a part of our environment now.\u201d Rainwater samples collected across Colorado and analyzed under a microscope contained a rainbow of plastic fibers, as well as beads and shards. The findings shocked Wetherbee, who had been collecting the samples in order to study nitrogen pollution. \u201cMy results are purely accidental,\u201d he said, though they are consistent with another recent study that found microplastics in the Pyrenees, suggesting plastic particles could travel with the wind for hundreds, if not thousands, of kilometers. Other studies have turned up microplastics in the deepest reaches of the ocean, in UK lakes and rivers and in US groundwater. A major contributor is trash, said Sherri Mason, a microplastics researcher and sustainability coordinator at Penn State Behrend. More than 90% of plastic waste is not recycled, and as it slowly degrades it breaks into smaller and smaller pieces. \u201cPlastic fibers also break off your clothes every time you wash them,\u201d Mason said, and plastic particles are byproducts of a variety of industrial processes. It\u2019s impossible to trace the tiny pieces back to their sources, Mason said, but almost anything that\u2019s made of plastic could be shedding particles into the atmosphere. \u201cAnd then those particles get incorporated into water droplets when it rains,\u201d she added, then wash into rivers, lakes, bays and oceans and filter into groundwater sources. Though scientists have been studying plastic pollution in the ocean for more than a decade, they can only account for 1% of it. Researchers know even less about the amount of plastic in freshwater and in the air, said Stefan Krause at the University of Birmingham. \u201cWe haven\u2019t really started quantifying it,\u201d he said. Another unknown is whether it would be theoretically possible to flush all plastic out of the natural world, and how long that might take. \u201cEven if we waved a magic wand and stopped using plastic, it\u2019s unclear how long plastic would continue to circulate through our rivers waters systems,\u201d he said. \u201cBased on what we do know about plastic found in deep sources of groundwater, and accumulated in rivers, I would guess centuries.\u201d Animals and humans consume microplastics via water and food, and we likely breathe in micro- and nanoplastic particles in the air, though scientists have yet to understand the health effects. Microplastics can also attract and attach to heavy metals like mercury and other hazardous chemicals, as well as toxic bacteria. \u201cPlastic particles from furniture and carpets could contain flame retardants that are toxic to humans,\u201d Krause said. Because we are all are exposed to hundreds of synthetic chemicals as soon as we\u2019re born, it\u2019s difficult to say how much longer we\u2019d live if we weren\u2019t exposed, said Mason. \u201cWe may never understand all the linkages between plastics and health.\u201d \u201cBut we know enough to say that breathing plastic probably isn\u2019t good, and we should start thinking about dramatically reducing our dependence on plastic,\u201d she said.",

      "body": "<p>On 25 October 2017, a pensioner living in the Netherlands created a new hashtag. Hendrik Klaassens was concerned about the rise of Europe\u2019s far right and wanted to bring campaigners together on Twitter. He settled on #FBPE: \u201cFollow Back Pro EU\u201d. Klaassens didn\u2019t specifically have Britain in mind, but within a few days of his tweet, anti-Brexit Twitter accounts started using the hashtag. Before long, they were adding it to their usernames, so that it would appear whenever they tweeted. And in late November, when Mike Galsworthy, an influential anti-Brexit campaigner, posted a widely shared <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mikegalsworthy/status/933686760411766785?lang=en\" title=\"\">video</a> on Twitter urging his followers to embrace it, #FBPE really took off. It wasn\u2019t a memorable hashtag, but it didn\u2019t need to be. The people consumed by their resistance to Brexit now had their own way to communicate, to find each other in the crowd.</p> <p>Today, Klaassens estimates that 15,000 people still use the hashtag, most of them in the UK. Their tweets have always see-sawed between defiance and distress, but in the weeks since Boris Johnson became prime minister \u2013 as they have become convinced that Britain is in the midst of a rightwing coup \u2013 they have grown increasingly despairing.</p> <p>The #FBPE brigade can appear locked in an arms race to out-remain each other. The descriptions that accompany their profiles are furnished with Brexiter slurs they\u2019ve reappropriated (\u201cremoaner\u201d, \u201csaboteur\u201d), lists of the European countries they\u2019ve lived in, and plainspoken declarations of devotion (\u201cRemain \u2013 all the way through like a stick of rock\u201d). They have come under attack from all sides: they are derided by Brexit supporters for being sore losers; mocked, even by many who voted remain, for their fanaticism and earnestness. Yet for this online tribe, #FBPE is more than a badge of solidarity \u2013 it has given them an identity.</p> <p>#FBPE is just one sect in a wider movement that was born the day Britain voted to leave the EU. Before the referendum, it felt as if the only people who really cared about the EU were the ones who wanted to leave it. But a week after Britain voted out, tens of thousands of people massed in Parliament Square. Protesters waved the EU flag, draped themselves in it, painted it on their faces. All the affection for Europe that had been unvoiced during the referendum campaign was suddenly coming out in a rush. Belatedly, a new movement had been born: remainism.</p> <p>When they\u2019re not soaking up anti-Brexit memes on Twitter, remainists can read <a href=\"https://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/home\" title=\"\">The New European</a>, a pro-EU newspaper, and anti-Brexit novels by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/12/autumn-ali-smith-review\" title=\"\">Ali Smith</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/nov/16/middle-england-by-jonathan-coe-review\" title=\"\">Jonathan Coe</a>. They can listen to podcasts like My Parents Voted Brexit and Remainiacs, and if they\u2019re looking for some remain-themed music, they can put on a recent album by The Matthew Herbert Brexit Big Band, which includes samples of Gibraltarian monkeys, a swimmer crossing the Channel and a Ford Fiesta being scrapped.</p> <p>Before the referendum, many of the people who have become remainists considered themselves immune to the passions of politics. They tended to hover around the centre ground and didn\u2019t strongly identify with any party. They were used to being on the inside, to being listened to. But since 23 June 2016, remainists have found themselves out in the cold. \u201cI just felt everything I believed in was stolen from me,\u201d Angela Ramsall, a prominent anti-Brexit voice, better known on Twitter as @spaceangel1964, told me.</p> <p>Remainists feel embattled, ignored; they lament what their country has become. They feel that the politicians who are meant to be on their side, and the media organisations that are meant to present facts impartially, have betrayed them. The system that had seemed to function, more or less, has broken down. Steve Deacon, a protester I met on a People\u2019s Vote march earlier this year, was at Glastonbury festival when he heard the referendum result. Before then, he had felt that \u201cthe world had been marching forward, and things were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/jul/28/is-the-world-really-better-than-ever-the-new-optimists\" title=\"\">getting better</a> incrementally\u201d. But since that day, it no longer seems that way to him.</p> <p>These are the kinds of sentiments that have come to be associated with leavers \u2013 the idea that the country had been going in the wrong direction, that it had become unrecognisable. But after the referendum, they were suddenly being voiced by remainists. \u201cIt was just so reminiscent of how radical-right voters would think,\u201d says Rob Ford, a political scientist at the University of Manchester who has researched the rise of Ukip. \u201cAnd it was remarkable how quickly that mindset descended.\u201d</p> <p>And so these people, who once dismissed radicals as unreasonable, have themselves become radicalised. They used to pride themselves on their moderation; now, spurred on by rage, they divide the world into enemies and allies. What they are doing is loud, obsessive, tribal, confrontational \u2013 politics, in other words.</p> <p>Three years in, remainists can\u2019t claim any concrete victories, but their fundamental demand \u2013 stopping Brexit \u2013 is now firmly in the mainstream. They have helped set the new conventional wisdom that Labour faces electoral wipeout if it doesn\u2019t commit to a second referendum; within the party, the pressure for holding another vote looks unstoppable. Only a few months ago, remainists seemed to be ascendant: each protest was bigger than the last, each delay to Brexit bought them more time. But Theresa May\u2019s resignation changed that. Remainists faded into the background over the summer, as the Conservative leadership election sucked up all the oxygen. Now, with Johnson in No 10, the Brexiters are once again on the front foot. As 31 October approaches, the remainists are running out of time \u2013 and anything less than staying in Europe will devastate them. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be like a bereavement for me,\u201d says Helen Harris-Burland, a campaigner from the Chilterns.</p> <p>Remainists often describe Brexit as a distraction from the real problems Britain faces \u2013 austerity, inequality, a creaking NHS. Yet those problems existed long before the referendum, without galvanising most remainists in the way Brexit has. For many remainists, in fact, it can feel as if everything <em>else</em> is a distraction: what drives them on is their belief that Brexit is the battle of a lifetime. Through a bruising, often disillusioning process, they have acquired a better idea of what matters to them, and how to get it. \u201cIt\u2019s been a fault of mine not being involved in politics before,\u201d Harris-Burland says. \u201cSince Brexit, I\u2019ve learned a huge amount about how the country works \u2013 and it\u2019s not very favourable.\u201d Europe is the terrain on which this has all taken place. But for remainists, just like leavers, the argument is really about Britain: the country they thought they were living in, and the country they want it to be.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Just as only a fraction of the people who supported Margaret Thatcher could be called Thatcherite, voting remain is not enough to make you a remainist. Remainists are the people who keep bringing the conversation back to Brexit. They point out that the referendum was only ever meant to be advisory, and insist that another one is just around the corner. They go on protests. They have strong opinions about Guy Verhofstadt and Sabine Weyand. They worry about chlorinated chicken. They have acquired detailed knowledge of electoral law and can list the leave campaign\u2019s violations. They light up at any mention of the 2012 Olympics. They wonder what Orwell would have made of all this. They hang the EU flag in their windows. (There is a group of remainists who call themselves EU Flag Mafia, and perform stunts such as hanging dozens of flags from poles in the sea <a href=\"https://www.essexlive.news/news/essex-news/42-european-union-flags-appeared-1549592\" title=\"\">off Southend</a>, like a gang of centrist situationists.)</p> <p>There are plenty of remainist groups: one, Wooferendum, even mobilises dogs against Brexit. The People\u2019s Vote campaign is the behemoth at the heart of organised remainism \u2013 so much so that it has become a kind of byword for resistance to Brexit. Launched last year by Open Britain, the successor to the official remain campaign in 2016, it has brought different, sometimes overlapping remainist organisations together under one roof (literally: they share office space in Westminster\u2019s Millbank Tower). There\u2019s the People\u2019s Vote brand itself, with its own local offshots and national marches; the two big grassroots groups, Britain for Europe and the European Movement, which work side by side. And then there are the specialist organisations that now come under the People\u2019s Vote umbrella \u2013 the likes of Our Future Our Choice (Ofoc) and Scientists for EU. If People\u2019s Vote, with its Westminster ties and celebrity supporters, represents the pinnacle of slick establishment remainism, then Sodem (which stands for Stand of Defiance European Movement, and is pronounced \u201csod \u2019em\u201d), is more homespun. Somewhere in the middle lies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/07/billboard-campaigners-brexit-led-by-donkeys\" title=\"\">Led By Donkeys</a>, a four-man band who have produced billboards featuring damning quotes from Brexiter politicians (Nigel Farage, May 2016: \u201cin a 52-48 referendum this would be unfinished business by a long way\u201d), earning them a place in the remainist pantheon.</p> <p>Ask a remainist what motivates them and they\u2019ll talk about the EU: its role in maintaining peace, the importance of countries working together for prosperity. They will smile wistfully as they recount teenage trips to Europe or their time spent studying there. Older remainists will mention fathers who fought in the second world war, to stress that a peaceful, united Europe can never be taken for granted.</p> <p>There is an antagonistic strain in remainism that is just as important as this idealism. \u201cEuropeanism has always been more anti-Eurosceptic than pro-European,\u201d says Robert Saunders, a historian at Queen Mary University of London. And what fuels remainists, three years into the Brexit process, is anger. They hate the people you\u2019d expect them to hate: Johnson, Farage, Jacob Rees-Mogg, \u201cAndrea Loathsome\u201d, to use one of their schoolboyish nicknames. They hate them for their lies, and their \u201ccakeism\u201d, the Johnsonian insistence that we really can have our cake and eat it: that Britain could leave the single market, say, without losing any of the benefits of being part of it. (One remainist podcast is called Cake Watch.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most of all, remainists hate the way the Brexiters keep getting away with it. Remainists hated Theresa May by the end; increasingly, they hate Jeremy Corbyn, too. Matt Kelly, the editor of The New European, considers this is a reasonable, pragmatic reaction to the failures of Britain\u2019s ruling class. \u201cIf someone\u2019s behaving in an extreme and bizarre manner then I think being pissed off is absolutely the appropriate response,\u201d he says. \u201cThe anger comes in waves \u2013 and it\u2019s pretty tsunami-esque at the moment.\u201d</p> <p>Remainists tend to put their faith not in politicians, but in bureaucrats and civil servants. But they make an exception for those MPs, such as Dominic Grieve or Yvette Cooper (even though she doesn\u2019t back a second referendum), who are willing to rebel against the party leadership or reach out to the opposite benches. Remainists wish these kinds of \u201cgrownups\u201d \u2013 seemingly responsible, competent people, capable of putting the national interest above ambition and petty rivalries \u2013 could clean up the mess. This is a vision, however fanciful, of politics without politicking. Once the grownups come to the rescue, it suggests, the rest of us can retreat, safe in the knowledge that everything is under control. Remainists look enviously at Europe, longing for a leader of their own \u2013 a Merkel, a Macron, a Tusk \u2013 to deliver Britain from Brexit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7a9094fc63a8cc58614a9ceac2cf8d36e6dfc5c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a9094fc63a8cc58614a9ceac2cf8d36e6dfc5c8/0_317_6127_3677/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anti-Brexit protesters from Sodem in London, December 2018\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anti-Brexit protesters from Sodem in London, December 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Imageplotter/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the People\u2019s Vote protest in March, that craving was clear: among the protesters, I spotted a woman with a handwritten \u201cEn Marche!\u201d sticker on her sleeve. The demonstration was the biggest show of support for remainism yet: somewhere between 300,000 and a million people marched through central London. That morning, I travelled to the protest from Bristol, one of the first places where the seeds of remainism sprouted, on a train chartered by local anti-Brexit groups, which they called \u201cthe People\u2019s Vote Express\u201d. One campaigner wandered through the carriages selling EU flags out of an Ikea bag.</p> <p>Halfway down the train, I started talking to Finbarr O\u2019Halloran, a warm, rosy-cheeked man who was carrying a Led by Donkeys placard. His story was a textbook case of remainist radicalisation. \u201cI\u2019d been fairly apolitical throughout my life, just letting them get on with it as long as the country was run in a reasonably sensible manner,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnd it\u2019s only the craziness of Brexit that\u2019s made me mad.\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Halloran was particularly infuriated by the misinformation, from politicians and the media, that he blamed for Brexit. \u201cForty years of lying have been done by the mainstream media to the British public,\u201d he said. He wasn\u2019t just thinking of the rightwing press. \u201cUnfortunately, the BBC is no longer a source of truth for what\u2019s going on in the country.\u201d This has become a signature lament for remainists, who accuse the broadcaster of pro-Brexit bias. Andrew Adonis, a Labour peer and anti-Brexit campaigner, has been particularly critical of what he calls the \u201cpublic disservice broadcaster\u201d. He tweeted in May that \u201cBBC News is so debased and biased, it should be replaced by a new independent news service\u201d.</p> <p>Remainists are the kind of people who used to rely on the BBC, and defend it against attacks from the left and right. Now they feel it is just one more institution that has failed them. So they have to look elsewhere \u2013 and, in many cases, Twitter has filled that void. AC Grayling, a philosopher who has become one of the most outspoken remainists, described to me how he spends half an hour on Twitter first thing each morning, while on his exercise bike or treadmill. \u201cNormally I start off quite slowly,\u201d he said. But as he gets annoyed by the latest Brexit news, he finds himself going faster and faster.</p> <p>Echo chambers like Twitter are important to remainists, as they are to all recent political movements. By providing a space for like-minded souls to furiously agree with each other and rage at the other side\u2019s idiocy, Twitter has helped remainists forge a common language, a shared story, an unmistakeably clear message \u2013 the things a political movement needs in order to take root. That effect is amplified by the rest of the remainist media: opening a copy of the New European provides that same feeling of being somewhere that is deliberately, happily, a bubble. In its first year, the paper readily baited leavers. More recently, though, it has dialled down the vitriol and settled into an exasperated sarcasm \u2013 a typical remainist mode.</p> <p>As you flick through the New European, you eventually leave Brexit behind for something that would have been unthinkable before 2016: the \u201cEurofile\u201d section, a weekly paean to Europe and its glories. Another section makes for an equally odd sight in a British newspaper: pages of articles by academics, under the heading \u201cExpertise\u201d.</p> <p>Expertise matters to remainists. They don\u2019t merely admire it \u2013 that admiration is an important part of how they define themselves. \u201cA lot of remainers are proud to say that they embrace complexity,\u201d says Ian Dunt, a journalist and presenter of Remainiacs. At the People\u2019s Vote march, a man in a lab coat was handing out flyers on behalf of Scientists for EU: \u201cfor those who believe in experts,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In their hunger for expertise, remainists have gravitated towards lawyers, such as David Allen Green and Jolyon Maugham, who have become celebrities in their corner of Twitter. Allen Green, a solicitor and legal commentator, plays the clear-eyed realist, slightly outside the fray; Maugham, a tax barrister, windmill enthusiast and hardened critic of Jeremy Corbyn, is more of a troublemaker, like a maverick general lobbing grenades and plotting sorties. For remainists, lawyers \u2013 and trade experts such as Dmitry Grozoubinski and David Henig \u2013 are an antidote to \u201ccakeism\u201d: with their understanding of how the world really works, they are the ones best equipped to lay bare the madness of Brexit.</p> <p>Behind this solemn reverence for experts lies the belief, or at least the forlorn hope, that if leavers were only forced to confront the facts on Brexit, they would be overwhelmed by the weight of evidence. It\u2019s a view reinforced by listening to James O\u2019Brien\u2019s radio show. Within the remainist ecosystem, O\u2019Brien is simultaneously the star pupil, the most popular kid in class and the playground bully: remainists worship him for the way he shreds leavers\u2019 arguments. As his impatience mounts, he drops his head in his hands \u2013 a pose that encapsulates how it feels to be a remainist today. \u201cCan we all agree that it\u2019s time to rename remain and leave?\u201d he tweeted earlier this year. \u201cI suggest right and wrong.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>What is surprising, looking back at the months after the referendum defeat, is how muted the initial remainist response was, once the immediate outpouring of grief had passed. \u201cThe grassroots was virtually zero,\u201d says Angela Ramsall. One group that did emerge shortly after the referendum, Bristol for Europe, set up a weekly stall to campaign for another vote. \u201cWe got a lot of hostility,\u201d says Eileen Means, one of the group\u2019s founders. \u201cWe were told we were like flat earthers.\u201d Activists described to me the loneliness they felt in those early days. \u201cSo many people said to me after the advisory referendum, \u2018give up, you lost. Get over it,\u2019\u201d says a spokesman, who asked not to be named, from EU Flag Mafia.</p> <p>At Westminster, too, few MPs gave remainism the time of day. Even politicians who are now ardent remainists were resistant. In December 2016, Chuka Umunna <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/chuka-umunna-remain-campaigners-must-drop-calls-for-new-brexit-vote-a3410601.html\" title=\"\">urged campaigners</a> to stop calling for a second referendum. In the absence of leadership from MPs, figures from outside party politics filled the void. Most prominent was Gina Miller, the fund manager who argued that it would be illegal to invoke article 50 without a parliamentary vote, and launched a case that ended up in the high court. Miller signalled to remainists that it was no use sitting around, waiting for the grownups to show up: they would have to roll up their sleeves and get stuck in themselves. By addressing Brexit through the courts, like the other legal challenges that followed, Miller was aligning remainism with the pillars of stability and order: the constitution, the rule of law. It was a way of doing politics that could pose as unpolitical.</p> <p>When Theresa May called a snap general election in April 2017, \u201cit felt like a particularly bleak moment,\u201d says Jolyon Maugham. In response, he came up with the idea of launching Spring, a new party. \u201cI wanted to find a way for those who felt like I did to stand together and say: \u2018This is not who we are,\u2019\u201d he said. His plans were big. He would hold a 28-day festival at the football stadium in Maidenhead, May\u2019s constituency. Each day would be dedicated to the national dress and cuisine of a different EU member state. For the finale, Maugham planned to announce that he was standing in Maidenhead as a Spring candidate.</p> <p>In the end, Maugham decided he didn\u2019t have enough time to go ahead with it. But throughout 2017 it felt as if every remainist was toying with the idea of starting a party. In August, James Chapman, a former aide to George Osborne and David Davis, proposed setting up the Democrats. A couple of months later, Jeremy Cliffe, an Economist journalist, sounded out his Twitter followers to see if they were interested in a possible new anti-Brexit party. Emails of support flooded in: without really intending to, he had launched the Radicals, \u201cpro-tech, pro-Europe, social-liberal\u201d \u2013 and, ultimately, short-lived. While Chapman limited his platform to stopping Brexit, Cliffe\u2019s was a fever dream of technocratic renewal: he wanted to scrap VAT, abolish the green belt and introduce Swedish-style social insurance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2cfb5fe3a4524cb5e001c7e692191bf2a87f3b5c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2cfb5fe3a4524cb5e001c7e692191bf2a87f3b5c/0_249_6307_3785/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Madeleina Kay protesting in Brussels, April 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Madeleina Kay protesting in Brussels, April 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By then, remainism was starting to gather momentum. The election result had given remainists some hope: by depriving the Conservatives of a majority, it left May facing a trickier path to Brexit. And while younger remainists had been a quieter presence until this point, that started to change in October, when a 23-year-old activist arrived at a Brussels press conference dressed as a Brexit-fighting superhero.</p> <p>Madeleina Kay\u2019s outfit \u2013 EU stars encircling the Superman symbol \u2013 caused such a stir that she was thrown out of the conference. But she now had a nickname, EU Supergirl, which stuck, even as she went on to dress up as Wonder Woman, a policewoman, and the Queen of Hearts, all in the service of stopping Brexit. Her cult following was boosted by the music videos she posted online: occupying the naffer edges of remainism, they include the kind of love songs or break-up ballads one might hear at an open-mic night, but addressed to the EU (\u201calways thought you were the problem, now I see the problem was me\u201d). Soon after Kay\u2019s arrival on the scene, at the end of 2017, four campaigners in their 20s \u2013 among them Femi Oluwole, whose videos and tireless tweeting have made him a remainist celebrity \u2013 set up Our Future Our Choice to mobilise students and make the case for why Brexit will hurt young people.</p> <p>The young occupy a special place in the remainist psyche. On the People\u2019s Vote march, there were protesters who put the names, or even photos, of their grandchildren on placards. At remain meetings I attended over recent months, many attendees backed giving a vote to 16- and 17-year-olds if another referendum takes place. And even elderly remainists delight in pointing out that as many as a million leave voters have died since 2016, believing that this tips the balance in remain\u2019s favour.</p> <p>Of course, the young symbolise the future of the country \u2013 the very future that Brexit threatens. Yet behind these concerns for the future lies a more old-fashioned worldview. It\u2019s leavers who are typically accused of indulging imperial nostalgia, by insisting that Brexit will revive Britain\u2019s bygone greatness. But you can find that same nostalgia in remainists\u2019 fear that leaving the EU will finish off whatever greatness remains. In the words of Michael Heseltine \u2013 who, as a Tory grandee who voted Lib Dem in the European elections, represents the Platonic form of a \u201cgrownup\u201d \u2013 Brexit would mean Britain \u201cvoluntarily stepping down from its position of world pre-eminence\u201d.</p> <p>Some of this same nostalgia seems to inform the familiar lament about how far Britain has fallen, reducing itself to a laughing stock on the world stage. But the real embarrassment for remainists is not how the rest of the world views Britain \u2013 it is seeing their own country ruled by politicians who have parted ways with reason and decency. They shudder at every new degradation Britain faces, while also accepting it as the inevitable fulfillment of their warnings. The Irish journalist Fintan O\u2019Toole has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/16/brexit-paranoid-fantasy-fintan-otoole\" title=\"\">described Brexit</a> as a masochistic project but, as leavers are fond of pointing out, remainists have a masochistic streak of their own. The most zealous remainists give the impression of relishing each morsel of bad news \u2013 growth slowing, a car plant closing \u2013 as if willing on the damage that confirms their worst fears. Like revolutionaries striving to heighten the contradictions, they believe that only then will leave voters see the error of their ways, and the politicians who deceived them get what they deserve.</p> <p>As much as remainists worry about the future, they see themselves on the right side of history. \u201cIt is inevitable that pro-EU attitudes will grow,\u201d says AC Grayling. \u201cIf we were to leave, it wouldn\u2019t be for very long in historical terms. Maybe five or 10 years.\u201d That makes Brexit a blip \u2013 a glitch in the system, destined to be righted. When I asked remainists if they were worried about what might happen if Brexit were stopped \u2013 how leave voters could react to the result of the referendum being rejected \u2013 no one seemed too concerned. Much as remainists claim to champion complexity, their own optimism is not so different from the kind currently coming out of No 10: it is as if the past three years could be magicked away, Brexit and its supporters bypassed, at little enduring cost.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>For much of his career, Andrew Adonis was the kind of politician who felt more comfortable in the background. As a peer, he was even able to become a Labour minister without being elected. But by the end of 2017, he felt that no one was really making the case against Brexit. \u201cJust as the country was in danger of literally going over the cliff, I felt it was my duty to weigh in,\u201d he told me, over coffee at Millbank House in Westminster. So Adonis threw himself into campaigning. (Earlier this year, when he ran unsuccessfully for the European parliament, he squandered some of his remainist capital by briefly backing Labour\u2019s plans to carry out Brexit.)</p> <p>On a bright Thursday evening in April, I saw Adonis speak at a Lambeth for Europe event in south London. Lambeth voted remain by a bigger margin than any other area in the UK, and Adonis drew a rapt crowd of a hundred-odd people. Wearing a brown suit and a turquoise shirt, Adonis resembled a 1970s university lecturer (he worked briefly as an academic), and there was something teacherly in the way he addressed the audience. Amid figures on Britain\u2019s trade with the EU, and references to the intricacies of the withdrawal agreement, he explained why all proposals \u2013 apart from a second referendum \u2013 were, ultimately, doomed.</p> <p>Adonis defines remainism as a revolt of the middle class \u2013 and that is why he believes that, in the end, Brexit won\u2019t happen. \u201cThe English middle class, deeply alarmed, will be heard and will win,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat\u2019s my whole experience of politics.\u201d Remainism is seen, not entirely unfairly, as an unusually middle-class protest movement, but remainists have attempted to flip that perception by branding Brexiters, or at least the politicians who speak on their behalf, as the true elite. Tweeting about Nigel Farage in March, Alastair Campbell wrote, \u201cDulwich College. City trader. MEP. Billionaire friends with private jets.\u201d</p> <p>In a moment of crowd-pleasing populism during his talk, Adonis proposed banning anyone who had been to Eton from holding public office. Coming from a man who sits in the House of Lords, this rhetoric can feel a little hollow, but it certainly played well with the audience. Adonis peppered his talk with references to \u201cNigel\u201d and \u201cJacob\u201d, knowing that merely mentioning those names was enough to fire up his crowd. \u201cWhenever Boris or Jacob Rees-Mogg make one of their speeches, we get another flush of people,\u201d Eileen Means, from Bristol for Europe, told me.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"31b86db99d6391d1c08842a8eb9cd3842796d0df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31b86db99d6391d1c08842a8eb9cd3842796d0df/0_122_6016_3611/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An anti-Brexit protester with a placard of Jacob Rees-Mogg, London, January 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An anti-Brexit protester with a placard of Jacob Rees-Mogg, London, January 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Chattle/Barcroft Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When it comes to regular leave voters, remainists often express a mixture of sympathy and pity, explaining that people were duped. They quote James O\u2019Brien: \u201cContempt for the conmen. Compassion for the conned.\u201d A couple of days after the Adonis talk, I went to Nottingham for a meeting of anti-Brexit campaigners from across the East Midlands, a region where almost 59% of voters backed leave. Over three hours, as everyone crowded into the meeting room of an art gallery, the speakers reported back from their respective counties. Few of them were cheery. \u201cMy experience has been that there\u2019s been little change in people\u2019s views,\u201d said the founder of the Nottinghamshire branch of the European Movement, an elderly man in a navy blazer. There was a yearning, in the room, for finding the right language with which to communicate with leavers. A woman asked what to do when someone cited sovereignty as a reason for leaving the EU, no matter the economic costs. \u201cI don\u2019t understand it,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Even here, in a part of the country where remainers are a minority, there was some bafflement about why people might support Brexit. But other attendees at the meeting told me they hadn\u2019t been surprised by the referendum result. John Bland, who runs the Lincolnshire branch of the European Movement, suggested that places such as Boston \u2013 often held up as the emblematic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/16/trip-london-lincolnshire-brexit-divide\" title=\"\">leave-voting town</a> \u2013 supported Brexit because they had experienced a rapid rise in immigration without getting the support they needed. Between 2001 and 2011, the number of Boston\u2019s residents who weren\u2019t born in the UK more than quintupled; 75.6% of voters there backed leave, the highest proportion in the country.</p> <p>Yet as much as remainists insist otherwise, their Brexiter critics still accuse them of looking down on leave supporters. And it\u2019s true that derision does sometimes rise to the surface. On the People\u2019s Vote protest in March, remainists wielded signs that mocked leavers while trumpeting their own superiority: \u201c52% Pride and Prejudice 48% Sense and Sensibility,\u201d read one. But a lot of remainists aren\u2019t actually very interested in leavers. They prefer to look inward, at the 48% rather than the 52%. Surrounded by people who get their jokes, they have finally found a political identity that fits them. That means their priority is mobilising opinion, not changing it. If Brexit has torn the country apart, remainism isn\u2019t yet trying to put it back together.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Brexit is not the kind of fight that can end in a tie or a truce. Whatever happens, at least one side will believe they have lost. And for remainists, any kind of Brexit will feel like defeat. To win, before the clock ticks down, they have to complete the project they began three years ago: convincing enough of the country that Brexit isn\u2019t simply undesirable, but that it can \u2013 and should \u2013 be stopped.</p> <p>They have already travelled quite a distance. The rise in support for a second referendum could never have happened without the work of campaigners and groups like People\u2019s Vote. Merely repeating their message isn\u2019t what got them there \u2013 what matters is the way they have shouted it. A bolshier form of remainism now prevails, as if remainists are trying to match the stridency of the Brexiters. The rallying cry \u201cBollocks to Brexit\u201d is the kind of statement one might expect to hear, in tone if not content, from someone like Farage. Until recently, it would have been hard to imagine the Liberal Democrats co-opting it as their campaign slogan, as they did in the recent European elections. (Compare this to their almost parodically bland slogan at the last general election: \u201cChange Britain\u2019s Future\u201d.)</p> <p>And it has worked, up to a point. The Lib Dems spent years fruitlessly opposing Brexit, while they languished in the polls. That started to change when they dressed themselves in the clothes of remainism, borrowing its belligerence and fire. They came second in the European election \u2013 top in London \u2013 and seized the Conservative seat of Brecon and Radnorshire in a byelection earlier this month. And they have benefited, at the same time, from the discrediting of Labour\u2019s Brexit strategy \u2013 another remainist victory.</p> <p>But remainists worry that, as long as their votes are split across several parties, their influence will be limited. The Lib Dems, Greens and Plaid Cymru are now trying to remedy that. Over the next month, they plan to settle on 100 joint anti-Brexit candidates who will run at the next general election. Yet if this suggests they\u2019re willing to put Brexit above party loyalties, there\u2019s a limit to how far they will go. The Lib Dems\u2019 refusal to countenance joining any kind of caretaker government with Corbyn at the helm \u2013 even if that could rule out a no-deal Brexit \u2013 confirms that remainists are continuing to do politics under the guise of putting politics aside to serve the national interest.</p> <p>And there are divides within the movement, even on the question that defines it. According to emails leaked <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexwickham/peoples-vote-war-over-remain\" title=\"\">to BuzzFeed</a> in July, People\u2019s Vote campaigners are at odds over the group\u2019s stance on Brexit: it demands a second referendum but refuses, for now, to explicitly back remain, however obvious its allegiances may be. Then there are the biggest obstacles of all: the new prime minister, and a Labour leader who still won\u2019t bow to remainist demands.</p> <p>Where will remainism\u2019s energy go, once Brexit happens, or is somehow thwarted? Rob Ford draws a parallel with Scotland\u2019s independence referendum in 2014. \u201cYou had a similarly intense mobilisation, a similarly intense tribal identification with both sides.\u201d Almost five years later, he says, \u201cpeople are still much more attached to the independence cause on either side than they were before the referendum happened. But the volume dial has gradually got turned down in terms of how important it is.\u201d</p> <p>For remainists, it will be a test of just how radicalised they have become. Three years of resisting Brexit has taught them a fundamental lesson about politics. They now see that they are just another interest group \u2013 and if they want something, they have to fight for it themselves. That has been a painful realisation for remainists, but an invigorating one. \u201cI\u2019ve found a sense of moral purpose,\u201d says Jolyon Maugham. \u201cI think a lot of people are experiencing a similar epiphany. We are learning that there are no grownups in the room.\u201d In different parts of the country, I met remainists who had been apolitical before 2016, and were now planning to run for one of the anti-Brexit parties \u2013 the Lib Dems, Change UK, Renew.</p> <p>The question, though, is whether any other cause will stir the same passion in remainists as their current struggle. This is the crux of the leftwing critique of remainism: the charge that remainists are fixated with Brexit at the expense of everything else \u2013 and that rather than seeking to transform the country for the better, they just want to turn back the clock to the time before the referendum when they didn\u2019t have to think about politics because it didn\u2019t impinge upon their privileged bubble. Remainists see it differently. Unless Brexit is stopped and economic calamity averted, they argue, Britain won\u2019t have the money to pay for policies like ending austerity. \u201cWe care about those things,\u201d Cynthia Potter, an American campaigner who lives in Cardiff, told me. \u201cBut Brexit comes first.\u201d</p> <p>For now, the most committed of remainists have put their lives on hold. Madeleina Kay dropped out of university to focus on campaigning. Maugham has given up most of his legal work. Again and again, campaigners have thought that crunch time was approaching, only for the process to keep dragging on. Brexit hasn\u2019t simply consumed its opponents; it has left them in a purgatorial state, unsure of when they will finally be free.</p> <p>In June, almost three years to the day after the referendum, I went to Westminster for the daily protest by Sodem. The group began in September 2017, when Steve Bray, a rare-coins dealer from Port Talbot, came to London. \u201cI only thought I\u2019d be here for a couple of weeks, couple of months,\u201d he told me, wearing his trademark blue-and-yellow top hat with \u201cStop Brexit\u201d written across it. He started standing opposite parliament all day, waving a two-sided flag: the EU on one side, the union jack on the other. He snuck into the background of news broadcasts from Westminster, holding placards or shouting slogans. Before long, he became a kind of cult figure, and a hero to his fellow remainists: a one-man symbol of their collective defiance.</p> <p>As Bray\u2019s fame grew, people started joining him. One regular protester admitted to me that when she first saw him, she thought he was mad. But she kept coming back: it was a way to feel like she was doing something, to feel less alone. When I visited Sodem, there was a small group of protesters \u2013 mostly female, mostly middle-aged. In the kind of scene that has somehow become normal in Brexit Britain, they stand, facing the traffic, while someone periodically roars \u201cStop Brexit!\u201d Elspeth Williams, who runs the group\u2019s social media, is one of the people who shows up every day. Like other Sodem protesters I spoke to, she came across as gentle, with a hint of steel. She has lived in Spain for 25 years, but since last December she has been back in the UK so she can be part of the protest. She stays nearby in a flat that she rents with Bray and a few other protesters; until recently, they were on the same street as Jacob Rees-Mogg.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/20/the-death-of-consensus-how-conflict-came-back-to-politics\">The death of consensus: how conflict came back to politics</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I wondered what would happen to these people after Brexit. How might it feel to give so much of yourself to something and still come out on the losing side? Duncan Hodgkins, an army veteran and antiques dealer who now protests with Sodem full time, wasn\u2019t optimistic: he told me he expected Brexit to go ahead. But he didn\u2019t seem disillusioned. He glowed as he described how campaigning against it, his first taste of politics, had enriched him. \u201cI\u2019m so much more than the person I was before I started this,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve found abilities within me that I didn\u2019t realise I had: being able to communicate with different people, to have an actual opinion and not be scared to give it out.\u201d</p> <p>At the end of the afternoon, Sodem gathered around the gate to parliament for their daily \u201cshout\u201d. Bray yelled into a metal loudhailer, leading them through a series of slogans \u2013 \u201cBollocks to Boris\u201d and \u201cStop Brexit\u201d. Afterwards, a protester told me that when she had drawn tarot cards, they showed that Britain would stay in the EU. But it wasn\u2019t certain. \u201cI did that six months ago,\u201d she said. \u201cEnergies can change.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "On 25 October 2017, a pensioner living in the Netherlands created a new hashtag. Hendrik Klaassens was concerned about the rise of Europe\u2019s far right and wanted to bring campaigners together on Twitter. He settled on #FBPE: \u201cFollow Back Pro EU\u201d. Klaassens didn\u2019t specifically have Britain in mind, but within a few days of his tweet, anti-Brexit Twitter accounts started using the hashtag. Before long, they were adding it to their usernames, so that it would appear whenever they tweeted. And in late November, when Mike Galsworthy, an influential anti-Brexit campaigner, posted a widely shared video on Twitter urging his followers to embrace it, #FBPE really took off. It wasn\u2019t a memorable hashtag, but it didn\u2019t need to be. The people consumed by their resistance to Brexit now had their own way to communicate, to find each other in the crowd. Today, Klaassens estimates that 15,000 people still use the hashtag, most of them in the UK. Their tweets have always see-sawed between defiance and distress, but in the weeks since Boris Johnson became prime minister \u2013 as they have become convinced that Britain is in the midst of a rightwing coup \u2013 they have grown increasingly despairing. The #FBPE brigade can appear locked in an arms race to out-remain each other. The descriptions that accompany their profiles are furnished with Brexiter slurs they\u2019ve reappropriated (\u201cremoaner\u201d, \u201csaboteur\u201d), lists of the European countries they\u2019ve lived in, and plainspoken declarations of devotion (\u201cRemain \u2013 all the way through like a stick of rock\u201d). They have come under attack from all sides: they are derided by Brexit supporters for being sore losers; mocked, even by many who voted remain, for their fanaticism and earnestness. Yet for this online tribe, #FBPE is more than a badge of solidarity \u2013 it has given them an identity. #FBPE is just one sect in a wider movement that was born the day Britain voted to leave the EU. Before the referendum, it felt as if the only people who really cared about the EU were the ones who wanted to leave it. But a week after Britain voted out, tens of thousands of people massed in Parliament Square. Protesters waved the EU flag, draped themselves in it, painted it on their faces. All the affection for Europe that had been unvoiced during the referendum campaign was suddenly coming out in a rush. Belatedly, a new movement had been born: remainism. When they\u2019re not soaking up anti-Brexit memes on Twitter, remainists can read The New European, a pro-EU newspaper, and anti-Brexit novels by Ali Smith and Jonathan Coe. They can listen to podcasts like My Parents Voted Brexit and Remainiacs, and if they\u2019re looking for some remain-themed music, they can put on a recent album by The Matthew Herbert Brexit Big Band, which includes samples of Gibraltarian monkeys, a swimmer crossing the Channel and a Ford Fiesta being scrapped. Before the referendum, many of the people who have become remainists considered themselves immune to the passions of politics. They tended to hover around the centre ground and didn\u2019t strongly identify with any party. They were used to being on the inside, to being listened to. But since 23 June 2016, remainists have found themselves out in the cold. \u201cI just felt everything I believed in was stolen from me,\u201d Angela Ramsall, a prominent anti-Brexit voice, better known on Twitter as @spaceangel1964, told me. Remainists feel embattled, ignored; they lament what their country has become. They feel that the politicians who are meant to be on their side, and the media organisations that are meant to present facts impartially, have betrayed them. The system that had seemed to function, more or less, has broken down. Steve Deacon, a protester I met on a People\u2019s Vote march earlier this year, was at Glastonbury festival when he heard the referendum result. Before then, he had felt that \u201cthe world had been marching forward, and things were getting better incrementally\u201d. But since that day, it no longer seems that way to him. These are the kinds of sentiments that have come to be associated with leavers \u2013 the idea that the country had been going in the wrong direction, that it had become unrecognisable. But after the referendum, they were suddenly being voiced by remainists. \u201cIt was just so reminiscent of how radical-right voters would think,\u201d says Rob Ford, a political scientist at the University of Manchester who has researched the rise of Ukip. \u201cAnd it was remarkable how quickly that mindset descended.\u201d And so these people, who once dismissed radicals as unreasonable, have themselves become radicalised. They used to pride themselves on their moderation; now, spurred on by rage, they divide the world into enemies and allies. What they are doing is loud, obsessive, tribal, confrontational \u2013 politics, in other words. Three years in, remainists can\u2019t claim any concrete victories, but their fundamental demand \u2013 stopping Brexit \u2013 is now firmly in the mainstream. They have helped set the new conventional wisdom that Labour faces electoral wipeout if it doesn\u2019t commit to a second referendum; within the party, the pressure for holding another vote looks unstoppable. Only a few months ago, remainists seemed to be ascendant: each protest was bigger than the last, each delay to Brexit bought them more time. But Theresa May\u2019s resignation changed that. Remainists faded into the background over the summer, as the Conservative leadership election sucked up all the oxygen. Now, with Johnson in No 10, the Brexiters are once again on the front foot. As 31 October approaches, the remainists are running out of time \u2013 and anything less than staying in Europe will devastate them. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be like a bereavement for me,\u201d says Helen Harris-Burland, a campaigner from the Chilterns. Remainists often describe Brexit as a distraction from the real problems Britain faces \u2013 austerity, inequality, a creaking NHS. Yet those problems existed long before the referendum, without galvanising most remainists in the way Brexit has. For many remainists, in fact, it can feel as if everything else is a distraction: what drives them on is their belief that Brexit is the battle of a lifetime. Through a bruising, often disillusioning process, they have acquired a better idea of what matters to them, and how to get it. \u201cIt\u2019s been a fault of mine not being involved in politics before,\u201d Harris-Burland says. \u201cSince Brexit, I\u2019ve learned a huge amount about how the country works \u2013 and it\u2019s not very favourable.\u201d Europe is the terrain on which this has all taken place. But for remainists, just like leavers, the argument is really about Britain: the country they thought they were living in, and the country they want it to be. * * * Just as only a fraction of the people who supported Margaret Thatcher could be called Thatcherite, voting remain is not enough to make you a remainist. Remainists are the people who keep bringing the conversation back to Brexit. They point out that the referendum was only ever meant to be advisory, and insist that another one is just around the corner. They go on protests. They have strong opinions about Guy Verhofstadt and Sabine Weyand. They worry about chlorinated chicken. They have acquired detailed knowledge of electoral law and can list the leave campaign\u2019s violations. They light up at any mention of the 2012 Olympics. They wonder what Orwell would have made of all this. They hang the EU flag in their windows. (There is a group of remainists who call themselves EU Flag Mafia, and perform stunts such as hanging dozens of flags from poles in the sea off Southend, like a gang of centrist situationists.) There are plenty of remainist groups: one, Wooferendum, even mobilises dogs against Brexit. The People\u2019s Vote campaign is the behemoth at the heart of organised remainism \u2013 so much so that it has become a kind of byword for resistance to Brexit. Launched last year by Open Britain, the successor to the official remain campaign in 2016, it has brought different, sometimes overlapping remainist organisations together under one roof (literally: they share office space in Westminster\u2019s Millbank Tower). There\u2019s the People\u2019s Vote brand itself, with its own local offshots and national marches; the two big grassroots groups, Britain for Europe and the European Movement, which work side by side. And then there are the specialist organisations that now come under the People\u2019s Vote umbrella \u2013 the likes of Our Future Our Choice (Ofoc) and Scientists for EU. If People\u2019s Vote, with its Westminster ties and celebrity supporters, represents the pinnacle of slick establishment remainism, then Sodem (which stands for Stand of Defiance European Movement, and is pronounced \u201csod \u2019em\u201d), is more homespun. Somewhere in the middle lies Led By Donkeys, a four-man band who have produced billboards featuring damning quotes from Brexiter politicians (Nigel Farage, May 2016: \u201cin a 52-48 referendum this would be unfinished business by a long way\u201d), earning them a place in the remainist pantheon. Ask a remainist what motivates them and they\u2019ll talk about the EU: its role in maintaining peace, the importance of countries working together for prosperity. They will smile wistfully as they recount teenage trips to Europe or their time spent studying there. Older remainists will mention fathers who fought in the second world war, to stress that a peaceful, united Europe can never be taken for granted. There is an antagonistic strain in remainism that is just as important as this idealism. \u201cEuropeanism has always been more anti-Eurosceptic than pro-European,\u201d says Robert Saunders, a historian at Queen Mary University of London. And what fuels remainists, three years into the Brexit process, is anger. They hate the people you\u2019d expect them to hate: Johnson, Farage, Jacob Rees-Mogg, \u201cAndrea Loathsome\u201d, to use one of their schoolboyish nicknames. They hate them for their lies, and their \u201ccakeism\u201d, the Johnsonian insistence that we really can have our cake and eat it: that Britain could leave the single market, say, without losing any of the benefits of being part of it. (One remainist podcast is called Cake Watch.) Most of all, remainists hate the way the Brexiters keep getting away with it. Remainists hated Theresa May by the end; increasingly, they hate Jeremy Corbyn, too. Matt Kelly, the editor of The New European, considers this is a reasonable, pragmatic reaction to the failures of Britain\u2019s ruling class. \u201cIf someone\u2019s behaving in an extreme and bizarre manner then I think being pissed off is absolutely the appropriate response,\u201d he says. \u201cThe anger comes in waves \u2013 and it\u2019s pretty tsunami-esque at the moment.\u201d Remainists tend to put their faith not in politicians, but in bureaucrats and civil servants. But they make an exception for those MPs, such as Dominic Grieve or Yvette Cooper (even though she doesn\u2019t back a second referendum), who are willing to rebel against the party leadership or reach out to the opposite benches. Remainists wish these kinds of \u201cgrownups\u201d \u2013 seemingly responsible, competent people, capable of putting the national interest above ambition and petty rivalries \u2013 could clean up the mess. This is a vision, however fanciful, of politics without politicking. Once the grownups come to the rescue, it suggests, the rest of us can retreat, safe in the knowledge that everything is under control. Remainists look enviously at Europe, longing for a leader of their own \u2013 a Merkel, a Macron, a Tusk \u2013 to deliver Britain from Brexit. At the People\u2019s Vote protest in March, that craving was clear: among the protesters, I spotted a woman with a handwritten \u201cEn Marche!\u201d sticker on her sleeve. The demonstration was the biggest show of support for remainism yet: somewhere between 300,000 and a million people marched through central London. That morning, I travelled to the protest from Bristol, one of the first places where the seeds of remainism sprouted, on a train chartered by local anti-Brexit groups, which they called \u201cthe People\u2019s Vote Express\u201d. One campaigner wandered through the carriages selling EU flags out of an Ikea bag. Halfway down the train, I started talking to Finbarr O\u2019Halloran, a warm, rosy-cheeked man who was carrying a Led by Donkeys placard. His story was a textbook case of remainist radicalisation. \u201cI\u2019d been fairly apolitical throughout my life, just letting them get on with it as long as the country was run in a reasonably sensible manner,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnd it\u2019s only the craziness of Brexit that\u2019s made me mad.\u201d O\u2019Halloran was particularly infuriated by the misinformation, from politicians and the media, that he blamed for Brexit. \u201cForty years of lying have been done by the mainstream media to the British public,\u201d he said. He wasn\u2019t just thinking of the rightwing press. \u201cUnfortunately, the BBC is no longer a source of truth for what\u2019s going on in the country.\u201d This has become a signature lament for remainists, who accuse the broadcaster of pro-Brexit bias. Andrew Adonis, a Labour peer and anti-Brexit campaigner, has been particularly critical of what he calls the \u201cpublic disservice broadcaster\u201d. He tweeted in May that \u201cBBC News is so debased and biased, it should be replaced by a new independent news service\u201d. Remainists are the kind of people who used to rely on the BBC, and defend it against attacks from the left and right. Now they feel it is just one more institution that has failed them. So they have to look elsewhere \u2013 and, in many cases, Twitter has filled that void. AC Grayling, a philosopher who has become one of the most outspoken remainists, described to me how he spends half an hour on Twitter first thing each morning, while on his exercise bike or treadmill. \u201cNormally I start off quite slowly,\u201d he said. But as he gets annoyed by the latest Brexit news, he finds himself going faster and faster. Echo chambers like Twitter are important to remainists, as they are to all recent political movements. By providing a space for like-minded souls to furiously agree with each other and rage at the other side\u2019s idiocy, Twitter has helped remainists forge a common language, a shared story, an unmistakeably clear message \u2013 the things a political movement needs in order to take root. That effect is amplified by the rest of the remainist media: opening a copy of the New European provides that same feeling of being somewhere that is deliberately, happily, a bubble. In its first year, the paper readily baited leavers. More recently, though, it has dialled down the vitriol and settled into an exasperated sarcasm \u2013 a typical remainist mode. As you flick through the New European, you eventually leave Brexit behind for something that would have been unthinkable before 2016: the \u201cEurofile\u201d section, a weekly paean to Europe and its glories. Another section makes for an equally odd sight in a British newspaper: pages of articles by academics, under the heading \u201cExpertise\u201d. Expertise matters to remainists. They don\u2019t merely admire it \u2013 that admiration is an important part of how they define themselves. \u201cA lot of remainers are proud to say that they embrace complexity,\u201d says Ian Dunt, a journalist and presenter of Remainiacs. At the People\u2019s Vote march, a man in a lab coat was handing out flyers on behalf of Scientists for EU: \u201cfor those who believe in experts,\u201d he said. In their hunger for expertise, remainists have gravitated towards lawyers, such as David Allen Green and Jolyon Maugham, who have become celebrities in their corner of Twitter. Allen Green, a solicitor and legal commentator, plays the clear-eyed realist, slightly outside the fray; Maugham, a tax barrister, windmill enthusiast and hardened critic of Jeremy Corbyn, is more of a troublemaker, like a maverick general lobbing grenades and plotting sorties. For remainists, lawyers \u2013 and trade experts such as Dmitry Grozoubinski and David Henig \u2013 are an antidote to \u201ccakeism\u201d: with their understanding of how the world really works, they are the ones best equipped to lay bare the madness of Brexit. Behind this solemn reverence for experts lies the belief, or at least the forlorn hope, that if leavers were only forced to confront the facts on Brexit, they would be overwhelmed by the weight of evidence. It\u2019s a view reinforced by listening to James O\u2019Brien\u2019s radio show. Within the remainist ecosystem, O\u2019Brien is simultaneously the star pupil, the most popular kid in class and the playground bully: remainists worship him for the way he shreds leavers\u2019 arguments. As his impatience mounts, he drops his head in his hands \u2013 a pose that encapsulates how it feels to be a remainist today. \u201cCan we all agree that it\u2019s time to rename remain and leave?\u201d he tweeted earlier this year. \u201cI suggest right and wrong.\u201d * * * What is surprising, looking back at the months after the referendum defeat, is how muted the initial remainist response was, once the immediate outpouring of grief had passed. \u201cThe grassroots was virtually zero,\u201d says Angela Ramsall. One group that did emerge shortly after the referendum, Bristol for Europe, set up a weekly stall to campaign for another vote. \u201cWe got a lot of hostility,\u201d says Eileen Means, one of the group\u2019s founders. \u201cWe were told we were like flat earthers.\u201d Activists described to me the loneliness they felt in those early days. \u201cSo many people said to me after the advisory referendum, \u2018give up, you lost. Get over it,\u2019\u201d says a spokesman, who asked not to be named, from EU Flag Mafia. At Westminster, too, few MPs gave remainism the time of day. Even politicians who are now ardent remainists were resistant. In December 2016, Chuka Umunna urged campaigners to stop calling for a second referendum. In the absence of leadership from MPs, figures from outside party politics filled the void. Most prominent was Gina Miller, the fund manager who argued that it would be illegal to invoke article 50 without a parliamentary vote, and launched a case that ended up in the high court. Miller signalled to remainists that it was no use sitting around, waiting for the grownups to show up: they would have to roll up their sleeves and get stuck in themselves. By addressing Brexit through the courts, like the other legal challenges that followed, Miller was aligning remainism with the pillars of stability and order: the constitution, the rule of law. It was a way of doing politics that could pose as unpolitical. When Theresa May called a snap general election in April 2017, \u201cit felt like a particularly bleak moment,\u201d says Jolyon Maugham. In response, he came up with the idea of launching Spring, a new party. \u201cI wanted to find a way for those who felt like I did to stand together and say: \u2018This is not who we are,\u2019\u201d he said. His plans were big. He would hold a 28-day festival at the football stadium in Maidenhead, May\u2019s constituency. Each day would be dedicated to the national dress and cuisine of a different EU member state. For the finale, Maugham planned to announce that he was standing in Maidenhead as a Spring candidate. In the end, Maugham decided he didn\u2019t have enough time to go ahead with it. But throughout 2017 it felt as if every remainist was toying with the idea of starting a party. In August, James Chapman, a former aide to George Osborne and David Davis, proposed setting up the Democrats. A couple of months later, Jeremy Cliffe, an Economist journalist, sounded out his Twitter followers to see if they were interested in a possible new anti-Brexit party. Emails of support flooded in: without really intending to, he had launched the Radicals, \u201cpro-tech, pro-Europe, social-liberal\u201d \u2013 and, ultimately, short-lived. While Chapman limited his platform to stopping Brexit, Cliffe\u2019s was a fever dream of technocratic renewal: he wanted to scrap VAT, abolish the green belt and introduce Swedish-style social insurance. By then, remainism was starting to gather momentum. The election result had given remainists some hope: by depriving the Conservatives of a majority, it left May facing a trickier path to Brexit. And while younger remainists had been a quieter presence until this point, that started to change in October, when a 23-year-old activist arrived at a Brussels press conference dressed as a Brexit-fighting superhero. Madeleina Kay\u2019s outfit \u2013 EU stars encircling the Superman symbol \u2013 caused such a stir that she was thrown out of the conference. But she now had a nickname, EU Supergirl, which stuck, even as she went on to dress up as Wonder Woman, a policewoman, and the Queen of Hearts, all in the service of stopping Brexit. Her cult following was boosted by the music videos she posted online: occupying the naffer edges of remainism, they include the kind of love songs or break-up ballads one might hear at an open-mic night, but addressed to the EU (\u201calways thought you were the problem, now I see the problem was me\u201d). Soon after Kay\u2019s arrival on the scene, at the end of 2017, four campaigners in their 20s \u2013 among them Femi Oluwole, whose videos and tireless tweeting have made him a remainist celebrity \u2013 set up Our Future Our Choice to mobilise students and make the case for why Brexit will hurt young people. The young occupy a special place in the remainist psyche. On the People\u2019s Vote march, there were protesters who put the names, or even photos, of their grandchildren on placards. At remain meetings I attended over recent months, many attendees backed giving a vote to 16- and 17-year-olds if another referendum takes place. And even elderly remainists delight in pointing out that as many as a million leave voters have died since 2016, believing that this tips the balance in remain\u2019s favour. Of course, the young symbolise the future of the country \u2013 the very future that Brexit threatens. Yet behind these concerns for the future lies a more old-fashioned worldview. It\u2019s leavers who are typically accused of indulging imperial nostalgia, by insisting that Brexit will revive Britain\u2019s bygone greatness. But you can find that same nostalgia in remainists\u2019 fear that leaving the EU will finish off whatever greatness remains. In the words of Michael Heseltine \u2013 who, as a Tory grandee who voted Lib Dem in the European elections, represents the Platonic form of a \u201cgrownup\u201d \u2013 Brexit would mean Britain \u201cvoluntarily stepping down from its position of world pre-eminence\u201d. Some of this same nostalgia seems to inform the familiar lament about how far Britain has fallen, reducing itself to a laughing stock on the world stage. But the real embarrassment for remainists is not how the rest of the world views Britain \u2013 it is seeing their own country ruled by politicians who have parted ways with reason and decency. They shudder at every new degradation Britain faces, while also accepting it as the inevitable fulfillment of their warnings. The Irish journalist Fintan O\u2019Toole has described Brexit as a masochistic project but, as leavers are fond of pointing out, remainists have a masochistic streak of their own. The most zealous remainists give the impression of relishing each morsel of bad news \u2013 growth slowing, a car plant closing \u2013 as if willing on the damage that confirms their worst fears. Like revolutionaries striving to heighten the contradictions, they believe that only then will leave voters see the error of their ways, and the politicians who deceived them get what they deserve. As much as remainists worry about the future, they see themselves on the right side of history. \u201cIt is inevitable that pro-EU attitudes will grow,\u201d says AC Grayling. \u201cIf we were to leave, it wouldn\u2019t be for very long in historical terms. Maybe five or 10 years.\u201d That makes Brexit a blip \u2013 a glitch in the system, destined to be righted. When I asked remainists if they were worried about what might happen if Brexit were stopped \u2013 how leave voters could react to the result of the referendum being rejected \u2013 no one seemed too concerned. Much as remainists claim to champion complexity, their own optimism is not so different from the kind currently coming out of No 10: it is as if the past three years could be magicked away, Brexit and its supporters bypassed, at little enduring cost. * * * For much of his career, Andrew Adonis was the kind of politician who felt more comfortable in the background. As a peer, he was even able to become a Labour minister without being elected. But by the end of 2017, he felt that no one was really making the case against Brexit. \u201cJust as the country was in danger of literally going over the cliff, I felt it was my duty to weigh in,\u201d he told me, over coffee at Millbank House in Westminster. So Adonis threw himself into campaigning. (Earlier this year, when he ran unsuccessfully for the European parliament, he squandered some of his remainist capital by briefly backing Labour\u2019s plans to carry out Brexit.) On a bright Thursday evening in April, I saw Adonis speak at a Lambeth for Europe event in south London. Lambeth voted remain by a bigger margin than any other area in the UK, and Adonis drew a rapt crowd of a hundred-odd people. Wearing a brown suit and a turquoise shirt, Adonis resembled a 1970s university lecturer (he worked briefly as an academic), and there was something teacherly in the way he addressed the audience. Amid figures on Britain\u2019s trade with the EU, and references to the intricacies of the withdrawal agreement, he explained why all proposals \u2013 apart from a second referendum \u2013 were, ultimately, doomed. Adonis defines remainism as a revolt of the middle class \u2013 and that is why he believes that, in the end, Brexit won\u2019t happen. \u201cThe English middle class, deeply alarmed, will be heard and will win,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat\u2019s my whole experience of politics.\u201d Remainism is seen, not entirely unfairly, as an unusually middle-class protest movement, but remainists have attempted to flip that perception by branding Brexiters, or at least the politicians who speak on their behalf, as the true elite. Tweeting about Nigel Farage in March, Alastair Campbell wrote, \u201cDulwich College. City trader. MEP. Billionaire friends with private jets.\u201d In a moment of crowd-pleasing populism during his talk, Adonis proposed banning anyone who had been to Eton from holding public office. Coming from a man who sits in the House of Lords, this rhetoric can feel a little hollow, but it certainly played well with the audience. Adonis peppered his talk with references to \u201cNigel\u201d and \u201cJacob\u201d, knowing that merely mentioning those names was enough to fire up his crowd. \u201cWhenever Boris or Jacob Rees-Mogg make one of their speeches, we get another flush of people,\u201d Eileen Means, from Bristol for Europe, told me. When it comes to regular leave voters, remainists often express a mixture of sympathy and pity, explaining that people were duped. They quote James O\u2019Brien: \u201cContempt for the conmen. Compassion for the conned.\u201d A couple of days after the Adonis talk, I went to Nottingham for a meeting of anti-Brexit campaigners from across the East Midlands, a region where almost 59% of voters backed leave. Over three hours, as everyone crowded into the meeting room of an art gallery, the speakers reported back from their respective counties. Few of them were cheery. \u201cMy experience has been that there\u2019s been little change in people\u2019s views,\u201d said the founder of the Nottinghamshire branch of the European Movement, an elderly man in a navy blazer. There was a yearning, in the room, for finding the right language with which to communicate with leavers. A woman asked what to do when someone cited sovereignty as a reason for leaving the EU, no matter the economic costs. \u201cI don\u2019t understand it,\u201d she said. Even here, in a part of the country where remainers are a minority, there was some bafflement about why people might support Brexit. But other attendees at the meeting told me they hadn\u2019t been surprised by the referendum result. John Bland, who runs the Lincolnshire branch of the European Movement, suggested that places such as Boston \u2013 often held up as the emblematic leave-voting town \u2013 supported Brexit because they had experienced a rapid rise in immigration without getting the support they needed. Between 2001 and 2011, the number of Boston\u2019s residents who weren\u2019t born in the UK more than quintupled; 75.6% of voters there backed leave, the highest proportion in the country. Yet as much as remainists insist otherwise, their Brexiter critics still accuse them of looking down on leave supporters. And it\u2019s true that derision does sometimes rise to the surface. On the People\u2019s Vote protest in March, remainists wielded signs that mocked leavers while trumpeting their own superiority: \u201c52% Pride and Prejudice 48% Sense and Sensibility,\u201d read one. But a lot of remainists aren\u2019t actually very interested in leavers. They prefer to look inward, at the 48% rather than the 52%. Surrounded by people who get their jokes, they have finally found a political identity that fits them. That means their priority is mobilising opinion, not changing it. If Brexit has torn the country apart, remainism isn\u2019t yet trying to put it back together. * * * Brexit is not the kind of fight that can end in a tie or a truce. Whatever happens, at least one side will believe they have lost. And for remainists, any kind of Brexit will feel like defeat. To win, before the clock ticks down, they have to complete the project they began three years ago: convincing enough of the country that Brexit isn\u2019t simply undesirable, but that it can \u2013 and should \u2013 be stopped. They have already travelled quite a distance. The rise in support for a second referendum could never have happened without the work of campaigners and groups like People\u2019s Vote. Merely repeating their message isn\u2019t what got them there \u2013 what matters is the way they have shouted it. A bolshier form of remainism now prevails, as if remainists are trying to match the stridency of the Brexiters. The rallying cry \u201cBollocks to Brexit\u201d is the kind of statement one might expect to hear, in tone if not content, from someone like Farage. Until recently, it would have been hard to imagine the Liberal Democrats co-opting it as their campaign slogan, as they did in the recent European elections. (Compare this to their almost parodically bland slogan at the last general election: \u201cChange Britain\u2019s Future\u201d.) And it has worked, up to a point. The Lib Dems spent years fruitlessly opposing Brexit, while they languished in the polls. That started to change when they dressed themselves in the clothes of remainism, borrowing its belligerence and fire. They came second in the European election \u2013 top in London \u2013 and seized the Conservative seat of Brecon and Radnorshire in a byelection earlier this month. And they have benefited, at the same time, from the discrediting of Labour\u2019s Brexit strategy \u2013 another remainist victory. But remainists worry that, as long as their votes are split across several parties, their influence will be limited. The Lib Dems, Greens and Plaid Cymru are now trying to remedy that. Over the next month, they plan to settle on 100 joint anti-Brexit candidates who will run at the next general election. Yet if this suggests they\u2019re willing to put Brexit above party loyalties, there\u2019s a limit to how far they will go. The Lib Dems\u2019 refusal to countenance joining any kind of caretaker government with Corbyn at the helm \u2013 even if that could rule out a no-deal Brexit \u2013 confirms that remainists are continuing to do politics under the guise of putting politics aside to serve the national interest. And there are divides within the movement, even on the question that defines it. According to emails leaked to BuzzFeed in July, People\u2019s Vote campaigners are at odds over the group\u2019s stance on Brexit: it demands a second referendum but refuses, for now, to explicitly back remain, however obvious its allegiances may be. Then there are the biggest obstacles of all: the new prime minister, and a Labour leader who still won\u2019t bow to remainist demands. Where will remainism\u2019s energy go, once Brexit happens, or is somehow thwarted? Rob Ford draws a parallel with Scotland\u2019s independence referendum in 2014. \u201cYou had a similarly intense mobilisation, a similarly intense tribal identification with both sides.\u201d Almost five years later, he says, \u201cpeople are still much more attached to the independence cause on either side than they were before the referendum happened. But the volume dial has gradually got turned down in terms of how important it is.\u201d For remainists, it will be a test of just how radicalised they have become. Three years of resisting Brexit has taught them a fundamental lesson about politics. They now see that they are just another interest group \u2013 and if they want something, they have to fight for it themselves. That has been a painful realisation for remainists, but an invigorating one. \u201cI\u2019ve found a sense of moral purpose,\u201d says Jolyon Maugham. \u201cI think a lot of people are experiencing a similar epiphany. We are learning that there are no grownups in the room.\u201d In different parts of the country, I met remainists who had been apolitical before 2016, and were now planning to run for one of the anti-Brexit parties \u2013 the Lib Dems, Change UK, Renew. The question, though, is whether any other cause will stir the same passion in remainists as their current struggle. This is the crux of the leftwing critique of remainism: the charge that remainists are fixated with Brexit at the expense of everything else \u2013 and that rather than seeking to transform the country for the better, they just want to turn back the clock to the time before the referendum when they didn\u2019t have to think about politics because it didn\u2019t impinge upon their privileged bubble. Remainists see it differently. Unless Brexit is stopped and economic calamity averted, they argue, Britain won\u2019t have the money to pay for policies like ending austerity. \u201cWe care about those things,\u201d Cynthia Potter, an American campaigner who lives in Cardiff, told me. \u201cBut Brexit comes first.\u201d For now, the most committed of remainists have put their lives on hold. Madeleina Kay dropped out of university to focus on campaigning. Maugham has given up most of his legal work. Again and again, campaigners have thought that crunch time was approaching, only for the process to keep dragging on. Brexit hasn\u2019t simply consumed its opponents; it has left them in a purgatorial state, unsure of when they will finally be free. In June, almost three years to the day after the referendum, I went to Westminster for the daily protest by Sodem. The group began in September 2017, when Steve Bray, a rare-coins dealer from Port Talbot, came to London. \u201cI only thought I\u2019d be here for a couple of weeks, couple of months,\u201d he told me, wearing his trademark blue-and-yellow top hat with \u201cStop Brexit\u201d written across it. He started standing opposite parliament all day, waving a two-sided flag: the EU on one side, the union jack on the other. He snuck into the background of news broadcasts from Westminster, holding placards or shouting slogans. Before long, he became a kind of cult figure, and a hero to his fellow remainists: a one-man symbol of their collective defiance. As Bray\u2019s fame grew, people started joining him. One regular protester admitted to me that when she first saw him, she thought he was mad. But she kept coming back: it was a way to feel like she was doing something, to feel less alone. When I visited Sodem, there was a small group of protesters \u2013 mostly female, mostly middle-aged. In the kind of scene that has somehow become normal in Brexit Britain, they stand, facing the traffic, while someone periodically roars \u201cStop Brexit!\u201d Elspeth Williams, who runs the group\u2019s social media, is one of the people who shows up every day. Like other Sodem protesters I spoke to, she came across as gentle, with a hint of steel. She has lived in Spain for 25 years, but since last December she has been back in the UK so she can be part of the protest. She stays nearby in a flat that she rents with Bray and a few other protesters; until recently, they were on the same street as Jacob Rees-Mogg. I wondered what would happen to these people after Brexit. How might it feel to give so much of yourself to something and still come out on the losing side? Duncan Hodgkins, an army veteran and antiques dealer who now protests with Sodem full time, wasn\u2019t optimistic: he told me he expected Brexit to go ahead. But he didn\u2019t seem disillusioned. He glowed as he described how campaigning against it, his first taste of politics, had enriched him. \u201cI\u2019m so much more than the person I was before I started this,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve found abilities within me that I didn\u2019t realise I had: being able to communicate with different people, to have an actual opinion and not be scared to give it out.\u201d At the end of the afternoon, Sodem gathered around the gate to parliament for their daily \u201cshout\u201d.

Yet this thriving operation is just a drop in the ocean compared to its new sister site. When that one opens, in the spring of 2020, it will be the largest rooftop farm in the world.</p> <p>Currently under construction in the south-west of the city, this urban oasis will span approximately 14,000 sq metres (150695 sq feet) \u2013 also making it the largest urban farm in Europe.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s a warm afternoon in late spring and before us rows of strawberry plants rustle in the breeze as the scent of fragrant herbs wafts across the air. Nearby, a bee buzzes lazily past. Contrary to appearances, however, we are not in an idyllic corner of the countryside but standing on the top of a six-storey building in the heart of the French capital. Welcome to the future of farming in Paris \u2013 where a whole host of rooftop plantations, such as this one on the edge of the Marais, have been springing up of late. Yet this thriving operation is just a drop in the ocean compared to its new sister site. When that one opens, in the spring of 2020, it will be the largest rooftop farm in the world. Currently under construction in the south-west of the city, this urban oasis will span approximately 14,000 sq metres (150695 sq feet) \u2013 also making it the largest urban farm in Europe. With the plan to grow more than 30 different plant species, the site will produce around 1,000kg of fruit and vegetables every day in high season. Tended by around 20 gardeners, they will also be using entirely organic methods. \u201cThe goal is to make the farm a globally-recognised model for sustainable production,\u201d says Pascal Hardy, founder of Agripolis, the urban-farming company at the centre of the project. \u201cWe\u2019ll be using quality products, grown in rhythm with nature\u2019s cycles, all in the heart of Paris.\u201d Located on the top of a major exhibition complex currently under redevelopment in the 15th arrondissement, the Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, the farm will also have its own on-site restaurant and bar with capacity for around 300 people. Run by Paris\u2019s renowned chain of rooftop venues, Le Perchoir, this aerial eatery will offer panoramic views over the capital \u2013 and, needless to say, the menu will feature seasonal produce grown on the site. \u201cOur fresh produce will be used to feed the inhabitants across the south-west of the city \u2013 either directly, through veg-box schemes or via shops, hotels and canteens \u2013 thereby helping to reduce food miles,\u201d Hardy says. \u201cFurthermore, we won\u2019t be using any pesticides or chemicals, so the farm will be a haven for biodiversity.\u201d The farm will also offer a range of services related to urban agriculture, including educational tours, team-building workshops and special events. Last but not least, there will be the opportunity for local residents to lease small vegetable plots of their own \u2013 in specially-devised wooden crates \u2013 helping to reconnect city-dwellers with their food source. \u201cOur guiding principle with all our farms is to help foster environmental and economic resilience in tomorrow\u2019s cities,\u201d says Hardy, who expects the farm to start making a profit within its first year. \u201cIf we can create a model that is commercially viable, rather than having to rely on goodwill and subsidies, that will help urban farms to become sustainable in their own right.\u201d While large-scale urban farming is nothing new in itself, with major sites in The Hague, Detroit and Shanghai, among others, this new flagship farm in Paris will be ground-breaking in several ways. Not only will it be the largest rooftop farm in the world but they will also be pioneering their own technique in aeroponic \u2018vertical\u2019 farming. Apart from not requiring pesticides, this method uses a closed water system and no soil \u2013 therefore minimising the risk of any pollutants. Furthermore, by supplying people right on the doorstep, the farm will have an exceptionally low carbon footprint. \u201cOur vision is a city in which flat roofs and abandoned surfaces are covered with these new growing systems,\u201d says Hardy. \u201cEach will contribute directly to feeding urban residents who today represent the bulk of the world\u2019s population.\u201d For now at least, urban farming seems to be thriving here in all its forms. In fact, the City of Paris has committed to planting 100 hectares of vegetation across the capital by 2020, through its Parisculteurs project, with one third of this devoted to urban agriculture. For example, new for this year, a farming promenade is set to be created beneath the aerial m\u00e9tro line at Barb\u00e8s. Among the other imaginative agricultural sites across the city is the eco-farm of La Recyclerie, installed along the old railway line at Porte de Clignancourt, and the organic mushroom operation, La Caverne, located in an underground car park at Porte de La Chapelle.

The inquiry was triggered by high-profile raids on the News Corp journalist Annika Smethurst and the headquarters of the ABC, prompting concern that journalists could be charged for publishing protected information.

      "bodyText": "The cries of gulls and the screeches of terns fill the air. Flocks of migrating wading birds are feeding hungrily on invertebrates in the smooth mud, which glistens in the bright sunshine. A group of dunlins, most still displaying their black tummy patches of the summer, flies in and lands. White and black ringed plovers scurry between them. On the far shore of the harbour inlet, gleaming white sandwich terns squabble and jostle, some of the adults still feeding young. Most of the older birds are losing their breeding plumage, their black crests fading to untidy grey. Among them are Mediterranean gulls, common terns and little terns. Having nested on the nearby islands in the harbour, they will all soon be leaving. The tide has turned and the water is already rushing in, filling the channels and covering the small islands. Dozens of common redshanks collect together in a huddle by the grassy edges, waiting for the sea to retreat again. Turnstones sit on an iron groyne rising out of the harbour. Mediterranean gulls, with heavy red beaks, and smaller black-headed gulls float on the blue surface of the widening lagoon. Water is now lapping over the stones at my feet, and I turn and head back inland. Small butterflies accompany me along the bush-lined track. I stop where the bushes part and I look out across the inner harbour, now filled with water. Large curlews and a few, smaller whimbrels \u2013 their heads heavily striped and bills shorter, thicker than the curlews\u2019 \u2013 sit side by side on narrow grass-covered islands, obligingly allowing a comparison of the two similar species. Closer, standing in the water by some reeds, are two more migrating waders \u2013 spotted redshanks.

One has turned its head and tucked its beak under a wing as it sleeps. The other is awake, flashing the patch of red on its lower mandible as it busily preens the feathers on an outstretched wing.",

But his blackness, or his expression of it, is perhaps what has rubbed some up the wrong way.</p> <p>This reaction is a hallmark of Australia. There is no handballing this as some sort of cultural miscommunication. Goodes was booed out of the AFL, Abdel-Magied hounded out of the country and Faruqi doxxed into social media hiding.</p> <p>This is the way in which Australia enters into relationships with racialised bodies in this country \u2013 it is conditional. It is a relationship Simmons must know well, given his partnership with Goodes in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/02/the-australian-dream-review-adam-goodes-doco-driven-by-a-clear-desire-for-justice\">the film The Australian Dream</a>.</p> <p>Like Simmons, Goodes challenged that precarious relationship when he began to highlight racism in the AFL and Australian society more broadly. His Australia Day speech took into consideration the history of the country we walk on, instead of being a vanity photo op to showcase how far Australia has come as a nation.</p> <p>That perceived transgression, like that of Simmons, highlights the breaking of any kinship Australia had for Goodes. It elicited the howling of boos across all grounds, across all teams.</p> <p>In her book, Black Looks: Race and Representation, bell hooks references Lorraine Hansberry\u2019s play, Les Blanes, and describes the relationship between Charles, a white journalist, who longs for that connection with Tshembe, a black revolutionary.</p> <p>\u201cYet [Charles] continues to assume that he alone can decide the nature of his relationship to a black person. Evoking the idea of a universal transcendent subject, he appeals to Tshembe by repudiating the role of oppressor, declaring, \u2018I am a man who feels like talking\u2019. When Tshembe refuses to accept the familiar relationship offered him, refuses to satisfy Charles\u2019 longing for camaraderie and contact, he is accused of hating white men.\u201d</p> <p>Calling out racism broke the camaraderie either Goodes or Simmons were offered. They were no longer darlings in the sports arena, no longer national treasures. </p> <p>Inevitably, Alan Jones chimed in saying, \u201cBen Simmons, I know you\u2019re an Australian but go back to America and stay there.\u201d</p> <p>This reaction isn\u2019t down to Australians not liking politics and sport to mix. When Jones says go back to America it is because Simmons\u2019 allegations broke the contract of camaraderie.</p> <p>Simmons and Goodes become like Tshembe in Hansberry\u2019s play: they refuse to satisfy a relationship that doesn\u2019t involve them.</p>",

      "bodyText": "There is something of a pattern when it comes to people of colour in Australia talking about racism. There is a process of behaviour \u2013 a machine moving to silence whoever dares voice their opinion. NBA star Ben Simmons has become the latest to have to deal with the weight of the machine, following in the footsteps of Adam Goodes, Yassmin Abdel-Magied and Osman Faruqi, after posting on social media about alleged racial profiling at Melbourne\u2019s Crown Casino. The allegations were denied by Crown, and Simmons took down his Instagram post, but that was to be the least of his worries. Until the incident Simmons had been hailed as Australia\u2019s greatest basketball hope. He is the first Australian to have been the NBA\u2019s No 1 draft pick since 2005, and at 23 he is the country\u2019s richest ever athlete. Almost like clockwork, negative spins about Simmons started to roll in from the usual outlets after the casino incident. News Corp told how Simmons left fans \u201cdevastated\u201d by not stopping for selfies at a $200-a-head basketball camp. The positive anecdotes to come out of the event were a mere footnote. His support of Essendon also came in for criticism. On Channel Nine\u2019s Sunday Footy Show, the former AFL player Kane Cornes let it be known he was \u201csick\u201d of Simmons after the Bombers fan was pictured in a Melbourne jumper. The Murdoch media claimed it wasn\u2019t because Simmons was black that he sparked outrage, but rather because he was too American. But his blackness, or his expression of it, is perhaps what has rubbed some up the wrong way. This reaction is a hallmark of Australia. There is no handballing this as some sort of cultural miscommunication. Goodes was booed out of the AFL, Abdel-Magied hounded out of the country and Faruqi doxxed into social media hiding. This is the way in which Australia enters into relationships with racialised bodies in this country \u2013 it is conditional. It is a relationship Simmons must know well, given his partnership with Goodes in the film The Australian Dream. Like Simmons, Goodes challenged that precarious relationship when he began to highlight racism in the AFL and Australian society more broadly. His Australia Day speech took into consideration the history of the country we walk on, instead of being a vanity photo op to showcase how far Australia has come as a nation. That perceived transgression, like that of Simmons, highlights the breaking of any kinship Australia had for Goodes. It elicited the howling of boos across all grounds, across all teams. In her book, Black Looks: Race and Representation, bell hooks references Lorraine Hansberry\u2019s play, Les Blanes, and describes the relationship between Charles, a white journalist, who longs for that connection with Tshembe, a black revolutionary. \u201cYet [Charles] continues to assume that he alone can decide the nature of his relationship to a black person. Evoking the idea of a universal transcendent subject, he appeals to Tshembe by repudiating the role of oppressor, declaring, \u2018I am a man who feels like talking\u2019. When Tshembe refuses to accept the familiar relationship offered him, refuses to satisfy Charles\u2019 longing for camaraderie and contact, he is accused of hating white men.\u201d Calling out racism broke the camaraderie either Goodes or Simmons were offered. They were no longer darlings in the sports arena, no longer national treasures. Inevitably, Alan Jones chimed in saying, \u201cBen Simmons, I know you\u2019re an Australian but go back to America and stay there.\u201d This reaction isn\u2019t down to Australians not liking politics and sport to mix. When Jones says go back to America it is because Simmons\u2019 allegations broke the contract of camaraderie. Simmons and Goodes become like Tshembe in Hansberry\u2019s play: they refuse to satisfy a relationship that doesn\u2019t involve them.",

Why don\u2019t we do that?\u2019 \u201cAnd I\u2019d say, \u2018Excusi \u2026 Didn\u2019t I just say that?\u201d Bishop said she initially thought it was an individual problem but later discovered it was a widespread phenomenon affecting women globally. \u201cI just labelled it gender deafness,\u201d she said. \u201cI love men and I think they have a wonderful contribution to make to humanity. But if you\u2019re the only female voice in the room, they just don\u2019t seem to hear you. It\u2019s as if they\u2019re not attuned to it.\u201d During US president Barack Obama\u2019s first term in office, female White House staff devised an \u201camplification\u201d strategy to ensure their voices were heard. It went viral. When a woman made a good point, others would repeat it and credit the source. Bishop lamented being the only woman in Tony Abbott\u2019s new cabinet in 2013. \u201cI wasn\u2019t actually appointed,\u201d she said. \u201cI was elected deputy leader so I was there anyway. So if you put me aside, not one woman was selected and appointed.\u201d Bishop never embraced the term \u201cfeminist\u201d saying she did not like the label and preferred to focus on actions. During her last press conference as foreign affairs minister she was asked if the Liberal party was ever likely to elect a popular female leader, Bishop responded: \u201cWhen we find one, I\u2019m sure we will.\u201d Earlier this year she stopped short of calling for quotas in the Liberal party. Bishop was recently appointed the first female chancellor of the Australian National University and has attracted controversy over her private sector role with the international advisory firm Palladium.",

      "bodyText": "A judge who said borrowers could cut down on wagyu beef and \u201cthe finest shiraz\u201d to make their home loan payments is out of touch with reality, consumer advocates say. The Consumer Action Law Centre and the Financial Rights Legal Centre (FRLC) said the remarks, made by federal court judge Nye Perram, showed the law needed to be changed to force banks to properly consider the financial circumstances of borrowers. On Tuesday, Perram dismissed legal action the corporate regulator brought against Westpac in which it accused the bank of lending irresponsibly more than 250,000 times by using a controversial benchmark to decide whether to make home loans instead of working out whether each customer could afford to repay the money. Use of the benchmark, called the household expenditure measure or Hem, to make lending decisions was heavily criticised during last year\u2019s banking royal commission on the grounds it underestimates living expenses. But the federal court ruling allows Westpac, and other lenders, to continue to use the measure. Asic filed its lawsuit against Westpac in 2017 as part of a crackdown on the lax lending standards of Australian banks, who were at the time pumping money into the country\u2019s housing boom. It said Westpac had failed to meet responsible lending standards between 2011 and 2014 by using the Hem instead of living expenses declared by customers. But in his judgment Perram said Westpac \u201cdid have regard to these declared living expenses\u201d. The judge also said while the law required lenders to ask borrowers about their financial situation, he did not accept this had the \u201cconsequence that the credit provider must use the consumer\u2019s declared living expenses in doing so\u201d. He played down the importance of the Hem, saying by the end of the trial \u201cit had become clear that the evidence concerning the Hem benchmark was relevant only to one minor issue\u201d. And the customer\u2019s actual expenses were only relevant if they \u201csimply cannot be forgone or reduced beyond a certain point\u201d, he said. \u201cI may eat Wagyu beef every day, washed down with the finest shiraz but, if I really want my new home, I can make do on much more modest fare.\u201d Calc chief executive Gerard Brody said: \u201cTo suggest that borrowers ditch wagyu steaks and shiraz for cheaper food really is out of touch with the realities faced by most Australians.\u201d \u201cThe rules and procedures applied by Westpac could equally have approved borrowers who have significant medical expenses, or additional education and recreational expenses for a child with a disability. \u201cPeople who work long hours may eat out and/or have high child care costs as a necessary corollary of being able to keep the job they need to be able to afford their mortgage in the first place.\u201d FRLC chief executive Karen Cox said the decision was \u201cincredibly disappointing\u201d. \u201cThe decision suggests that banks do not have to have regard to people\u2019s actual expenses when they lend \u2013 which in turn will allow lenders to continue to extend unsustainable loans which set people up to fail.\u201d Asic will now have to pay the costs of a case both sides thought was settled last year. In September Westpac agreed to pay Asic $35m, which would have been the largest civil penalty levied under credit laws, and admit to failing to use declared expenses and failing to take into account the higher repayments due after interest-free periods expired on some loans. But, in a highly unusual move, Perram refused to approve the deal . Asic commissioner Sean Hughes said the regulator, which has 28 days to lodge an appeal, was \u201creviewing the judgment carefully\u201d. He said Asic took action against Westpac as a test case. \u201cAs a regulator, it is our role to test the law,\u201d he said. \u201cThe obligation to assess applications builds on the obligation on banks to make inquiries about a borrower\u2019s financial circumstances and capacity to service a loan and to verify the information that borrowers give banks.\u201d Westpac has been approached for comment.",

He added: \u201cIt also shows a clear differentiation among the candidates in terms of who is willing to take on the big insurance companies and the big pharmaceutical companies to benefit working Americans.\u201d <br></p> <p>Sanders\u2019 has long criticized what he refers to as the \u201cmainstream media\u201d and gripes often about coverage of \u201cpolitical gossip\u201d \u2013 reporting that covers the horse race as opposed to policy and the issues. <br></p> <p>This weekend, Sanders campaign is organizing a softball game against members of the press at Iowa\u2019s Field of Dreams baseball field.

Here\u2019s the top news of the day: FBI agents are reportedly angry Donald Trump is amplifying baseless conspiracy theories on Twitter about the death of disgraced financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein The NYPD is investigating potential hate crimes against Hasidic Jews in Brooklyn, New York Agents have descended upon Epstein\u2019s Virgin Islands compound as investigations into his crimes continue FBI agents are furious with Donald Trump for amplifying conspiracy theories regarding the death of disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, Business Insider reported on Monday. Agents who spoke with the publication said the response to the death of Epstein, who had ties to high-profile politicians, was already \u201chypercharged\u201d when Trump retweeted a baseless conspiracy theory tying the death to the former president Bill Clinton. \u201cThe last thing investigators need is the president of the United States fanning the flames with these bulls \u2013 theories that have no basis in reality,\u201d an anonymous agent told Business Insider. Epstein was found dead in his jail cell while awaiting trial for federal sex trafficking charges. Sources say there are no indications of foul play and that suicide remains the most likely cause of death. The New York City medical examiner\u2019s office completed its autopsy yesterday but said it needed more information before finalizing a cause of death. The Justice Department is opening an investigation into the circumstances of the death. Federal agents descended upon the private island of accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein as part of an ongoing investigation into the late financier, the FBI announced Monday. Epstein died of an apparent suicide on Saturday while in federal custody at New York\u2019s Metropolitan correctional center after being arrested on federal sex trafficking charges last month. His alleged victims say Epstein used his private island off the coast of St Thomas in the US Virgin Islands as a site to abuse young women and girls. The FBI and the Office of the Inspector General are investigating the death of Epstein, who had recently been taken off of suicide watch at the time of his death. The New York police department is investigating attacks on Hasidic Jews in Brooklyn early Monday morning as a hate crime. The hate crimes unit and local precinct are investigating the assaults, which were carried out against at least three people between the ages of 56 and 71. The New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, tweeted he will be directing the state police hate crimes task force to work with NYPD to \u201censure those responsible are held accountable\u201d. \u201cThis is sickening,\u201d he said. \u201cIn NY, we have absolutely zero tolerance for such heinous acts.\u201d Police believe there were three attackers and are still searching for them. Hello readers, Kari Paul in San Francisco taking over for the evening. More news to come. That\u2019s it from me today. My West Coast colleague Kari Paul will be taking over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands: Attorney General William Barr said Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s co-conspirators \u201cshould not rest easy\u201d after the alleged sex-trafficker\u2019s apparent suicide, vowing to bring them to justice. Epstein was taken off suicide watch late last month partly due to the urging of his defense team, according to ABC News. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell warned Beijing that any violent crackdown of the Hong Kong protests would be \u201ccompletely unacceptable.\u201d A Trump administration official urged all parties involved to refrain from violence. National security adviser John Bolton, who is in London visiting Boris Johnson, said the Trump administration was supportive of a successful Brexit and would back the move with a US-UK free trade deal. Bolton is the most senior Trump official to meet with the newly elected prime minister. The Trump administration announced a new policy penalizing green card applicants who use public benefits, raising concerns about low-income immigrant families disenrolling from programs like food stamps and Medicaid. Immigrants\u2019 rights groups and Democratic attorneys general have already threatened to sue. A friend of the Dayton shooter is facing charges for providing him with the body armor and a 100-round magazine he used in the attack. Kari will be covering more fallout from the Epstein case and the Hong Kong protests, so stay tuned. Immigrants\u2019 rights groups and Democratic attorneys generals are already threatening to sue the Trump administration over its new \u201cpublic charge rule.\u201d The policy would penalize green card applicants who use public benefits, like food stamps or Medicaid. Letitia James, the attorney general of New York state, said she would take legal action against the \u201cegregious rule\u201d. Marielena Hincapi\u00e9, the executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, made the same promise. \u201c[W]e will fight with every tool we have available to ensure that everyone in our communities has the freedom to thrive and the necessary resources to do so,\u201d Hincapi\u00e9 said in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to seeing Trump in court \u2013 again \u2013 and to seeing justice prevail as we defend immigrant families and our democracy.\u201d Bernie Sanders\u2019 top campaign advisers organized a conference call with reporters on Monday to argue that his presidential run was off to an \u201cexciting\u201d start \u2013 despite what one might gather from the evening news. \u201cThe headlines that Bernie\u2019s campaign is in free fall or is falling apart could not be further from the truth,\u201d Ben Tulchin, a campaign pollster, said on a press call with reporters. Jeff Weaver, a senior campaign adviser who served as Sanders\u2019 2016 campaign manager, railed against the \u201cundiscriminating acceptance of polls that fit existing narratives\u201d. He said Sanders treatment by the press at this phase in the race was similar to a period in 2015 that he called the \u201cBernie Black out.\u201d This time around, he called it the \u201cBernie write off\u201d. \u201cThere seems to be a direct correlation between the media coverage of polls and Bernie Sanders\u2019s specific standing in those polls: the better the number is in poll, the less coverage it receives and the worse he does the more he receives,\u201d Weaver said. He complained that a recent Quinnipiac poll showing Sanders had slipped to 14% generated 47 news stories in major media outlets while another poll showing him at 22% was covered in only two news stories. The call was organized as presidential hopefuls Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris gain ground on the Vermont senator. His team argued that Sanders is well positioned to win the party\u2019s nomination, noting that he has more cash on hand \u2013 $27.5 million \u2013 than any other Democratic candidate and 1 million volunteers working to help elect him. Perhaps most importantly, they argued, is that healthcare has emerged as a central issue in the primary \u2013 for candidates and voters. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly very positive terrain for us,\u201d Weaver said, insisting that Sanders\u2019s signature Medicare for all plan continues to convert supporters daily. He added: \u201cIt also shows a clear differentiation among the candidates in terms of who is willing to take on the big insurance companies and the big pharmaceutical companies to benefit working Americans.\u201d Sanders\u2019 has long criticized what he refers to as the \u201cmainstream media\u201d and gripes often about coverage of \u201cpolitical gossip\u201d \u2013 reporting that covers the horse race as opposed to policy and the issues. This weekend, Sanders campaign is organizing a softball game against members of the press at Iowa\u2019s Field of Dreams baseball field. The game is meant to show \u201cgoodwill and sportsmanship\u201d at a time when the media is frequently \u201cdemonized by the president.\u201d The Trump administration is advocating for the dissolution of a federal immigration judges\u2019 union that has been critical of the president\u2019s policies. The Justice Department argued in a Friday court filing with the Federal Labor Relations Authority that immigration judges are actually management officials and therefore ineligible to be represented by the National Association of Immigration Judges. NAIJ\u2019s president, Ashley Tabaddor, found that argument laughable. \u201cThis is nothing more than a desperate attempt by the DOJ to evade transparency and accountability, and undermine the decisional independence of the nation\u2019s 440 Immigration Judges,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cWe don\u2019t even have the authority to order pencils.\u201d The union has previously complained that the administration\u2019s metrics for evaluating immigration judges undermine judicial independence and due process. Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren voiced support for the pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, who have occupied the local airport: Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell warned in a statement that any violent crackdown of the protests by the Chinese government would be \u201ccompletely unacceptable,\u201d and the Trump administration has urged all parties to refrain from violence. Alleged sex-trafficker Jeffrey Epstein was taken off suicide watch late last month partly due to urging from his defense team, ABC News reports. The multimillionaire financier reportedly had to also undergo multiple psychiatric evaluations before prison officials approved the move. It is unlikely that footage exists of Epstein\u2019s apparent suicide, sources said, because cameras are not directed at individual cells in the unit where he was being held. Attorney General William Barr vowed earlier today that Epstein\u2019s co-conspirators would still face consequences despite the unexpected death. \u201cLet me assure you that case will continue on against anyone who was complicit with Epstein,\u201d Barr said in a New Orleans speech. \u201cAny co-conspirators should not rest easy. Victims deserve justice and will get it.\u201d Trump took another swing at Anthony Scaramucci, his former communications director who has been making the rounds on cable news today saying he does not support the president\u2019s re-election bid: A friend of the Dayton shooter is facing federal charges for providing him with the body armor, a gun accessory and a 100-round magazine he used in the attack. \u201cTo be clear, there is no evidence and allegation in this criminal complaint that [Ethan] Kollie intentionally participated in the planning of [Connor] Betts\u2019 Aug. 4 shooting,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Benjamin Glassman. \u201cI don\u2019t want that to be misconstrued.\u201d Authorities said Kollie bought the items for Betts and kept them at his home so that his parents wouldn\u2019t discover them. \u201cI can\u2019t speak to exactly what he thought he was going to use the firearm for,\u201d said FBI agent Todd Wickerham. \u201cBut we have not found any indication that he knew he was going to conduct this attack.\u201d The Houston Chronicle published an editorial over the weekend asking Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke to exit the presidential race and instead run for the Senate in Texas. \u201cBeto, if you\u2019re listening: Come home. Drop out of the race for president and come back to Texas to run for senator,\u201d the newspaper\u2019s editorial board wrote. \u201cThe chances of winning the race you\u2019re in now are vanishingly small. And Texas needs you.\u201d But if the former congressman did enter the race, he would join a crowded field that includes big names in the state like Army helicopter pilot MJ Hegar, former congressman Chris Bell and state Senator Royce West. Activist Cristina Tzintz\u00fan Ramirez also just announced she would run for the Democratic nomination. The eventual nominee will face off against Republican Senator John Cornyn, who has been preparing for a brutal race in the increasingly purple state by stockpiling millions of campaign dollars. National security adviser John Bolton, who is in London meeting with Boris Johnson, said the Trump administration backs a successful Brexit and would support it with a US-UK free trade deal. Bolton said of the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, \u201cIf that\u2019s the decision of the British government we will support it enthusiastically, and that\u2019s what i\u2019m trying to convey. We\u2019re with you, we\u2019re with you.\u201d Bolton\u2019s meeting with Johnson makes him the most senior Trump administration official to meet with the newly elected prime minister. Democratic presidential candidates are marking the two-year anniversary since the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, which claimed the life of counterprotester Heather Heyer: Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell warned that any violent crackdown of Hong Kong protests by the Chinese government would be \u201ccompletely unacceptable.\u201d A senior Trump administration official and a State Department spokesperson also urged all parties to refrain from violence. The senior official emphasized that the administration was supporting democracy but reiterated the president\u2019s past comment that it was a matter between China and Hong Kong. The warnings came as protesters shut down Hong Kong\u2019s airport, resulting in the cancellation of hundreds of flights. Our colleagues Erin Hale and Lily Kuo report: The unprecedented cancellation of all flights followed the fourth consecutive day of protests at the airport and amid increasingly threatening statements from Beijing. A Chinese official said \u2018terrorism\u2019 was emerging in the city, while in Hong Kong authorities demonstrated water cannon for use in crowd control. The protests are in their 10th week, with confrontations between protesters and police growing more violent. Rights groups and democracy activists have accused police of using increasingly excessive force. At least 40 people were treated in hospital after clashes on Sunday, including a woman who was hit, reportedly with a beanbag round, and could potentially lose an eye. Les Wexner, the CEO of L Brands, has been providing federal investigators with documents that he says show Jeffrey Epstein misappropriated funds as his money manager, CNBC reports. One source said Wexner believes the documents show \u201call sorts of irregularities and theft.\u201d \u201cThere were things that were completely wrong and transactions that weren\u2019t appropriate,\u201d the source said. Wexner has reportedly been cooperating with federal investigators for weeks, well before Epstein\u2019s apparent suicide on Saturday. L Brand\u2019s stock has slid about 15 percent since the New York Times first reported on Wexner\u2019s connection to the alleged sex-trafficker. Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris had some harsh words today for Trump, who she said had \u201cbetrayed\u201d a lot of people with broken campaign promises. The California senator\u2019s comments came on the final day of her Iowa bus tour, part of her strategic pivot to focus on the first voting state of the Democratic primaries. The New York Times reports: As Ms. Harris trundles her way across Iowa on a five-day bus tour that is her longest trip yet to any early primary state, the California Democrat\u2019s embrace of Iowa\u2019s quirky political traditions has delivered the unmistakable message that the state\u2019s kickoff caucuses are increasingly central to her 2020 calculations after months of focus on South Carolina. By the end of her tour on Monday, Ms. Harris will have made more stops in Iowa on this trip than she did in the entire first half of 2019, according to the Des Moines Register\u2019s candidate tracker. She did not once venture farther west than the Des Moines suburbs until July, as her one planned trip there was scratched because of Senate votes. Richard Berman, the federal judge who was overseeing Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s case and denied him bail, said through chambers that the alleged sex trafficker\u2019s death is \u201ca tragedy to everyone involved in this case.\u201d Attorney General William Barr vowed earlier today that Epstein\u2019s co-conspirators would still be held accountable. \u201cAny co-conspirators should not rest easy,\u201d Barr said in a New Orleans speech. \u201cVictims deserve justice and will get it.\u201d Some of Trump\u2019s evangelical supporters, a key constituency for the president, were distraught after a recent rally, when he repeatedly used the word \u201cgoddamn.\u201d Oddly, they did not express similar concerns about a racist \u201cSend her back!\u201d chant that broke out about Representative Ilhan Omar during the rally. Politico reports: Paul Hardesty didn\u2019t pay much attention to [Trump]\u2019s campaign rally in Greenville, N.C., last month until a third concerned constituent rang his cell phone. The residents of Hardesty\u2019s district \u2014 he\u2019s a Trump-supporting West Virginia state senator \u2014 were calling to complain that Trump was \u2018using the Lord\u2019s name in vain,\u2019 as Hardesty recounted. ... The issue has recently hit a nerve among those who have become some of the president\u2019s most reliable supporters: white evangelicals \u2014 who comprise much of Hardesty\u2019s district. The group was key to Trump\u2019s 2016 win, helping bolster his standing in critical swing states, and Trump likely needs to maintain that support if he wants to win a second term. But some are growing fatigued with the irreverent language that often seeps into Trump\u2019s rallies and official events. \u2018I\u2019ve had people come to me and say, \u2018You know I voted for [Trump], but if he doesn\u2019t tone down the rhetoric, I might just stay home this time,\u2019\u2019 Hardesty said. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Attorney General William Barr said in a speech that there were \u201cserious irregularities\u201d about Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s confinement at Metropolitan Correctional Center and vowed that his co-conspirators would not go unpunished. The Trump administration announced a new policy penalizing green card applicants who use public benefits, raising concerns about low-income immigrant families disenrolling from programs like food stamps and Medicaid. Trump officials are also moving to overhaul the Endangered Species Act, despite critics\u2019 warnings that it will drive more plants and animals to extinction. The president\u2019s former communications director, Anthony Scaramucci, said he would not support Trump\u2019s re-election bid. The blog is monitoring more developments on the Epstein case and the Trump administration\u2019s policy maneuvers, so stay tuned. Attorney General William Barr said that he was \u201cappalled and frankly angry\u201d about the Metropolitan Correctional Center\u2019s \u201cfailure\u201d to adequately monitor Jeffrey Epstein before his apparent suicide. The comments in his speech at the National Fraternal Order of Police\u2019s conference in New Orleans came two days after the attorney general issued a similar statement on Epstein\u2019s death announcing the Justice Department\u2019s investigation into the matter. \u201cI was appalled to learn that Jeffrey Epstein was found dead early this morning from an apparent suicide while in federal custody,\u201d Barr said in that statement. \u201cMr. Epstein\u2019s death raises serious questions that must be answered.\u201d Since taking office, Trump has made more than 12,000 false or misleading statements, according to the Washington Post\u2019s count. The Post reports: Trump crossed the 10,000 mark on April 26, and he has been averaging about 20 fishy claims a day since then. From the start of his presidency, he has averaged about 13 such claims a day. About one-fifth of these claims are about immigration, his signature issue \u2014 a percentage that has grown since the government shut down over funding for his promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. In fact, his most repeated claim \u2014 190 times \u2014 is that his border wall is being built. Congress balked at funding the concrete barrier he envisioned, so he has tried to pitch bollard fencing and repairs of existing barriers as \u2018a wall.\u2019 ... Trump has falsely claimed 186 times that the U.S. economy today is the best in history. He began making this claim in June 2018, and it quickly became one of his favorites. Attorney General William Barr noted that there were \u201cserious irregularities\u201d about Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s confinement at Metropolitan Correctional Center, but he did not specify what they were. According to reports, Epstein did not have a cellmate at the time his body was discovered, which he should have. His previous cellmate was transferred Friday and not replaced. Corrections officers should have also been checking on Epstein, who was recently placed on suicide watch, every 30 minutes. But he had been left alone for \u201cseveral\u201d hours by the time his body was discovered early Saturday morning, a source told the Washington Post. All of these circumstances will likely be investigated by the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general, the FBI and New York City medical examiner\u2019s office -- all of whom have launched probes into Epstein\u2019s death. Trump spoke once again today with Boris Johnson and told the new British prime minister that he hopes to meet with him personally \u201cin the near future,\u201d according to the White House. National security adviser John Bolton is also in London to meet with Johnson, among others, making Bolton the most senior Trump official to visit the new prime minister. Trump was most recently in the United Kingdom in June to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Attorney General William Barr warned any co-conspirators of Jeffrey Epstein that they will still be brought to justice, despite the alleged sex trafficker\u2019s apparent suicide. \u201cLet me assure you that case will continue on against anyone who was complicit with Epstein,\u201d Barr said in a speech at the National Fraternal Order of Police\u2019s conference in New Orleans. \u201cAny co-conspirators should not rest easy. Victims deserve justice and will get it.\u201d Barr also vowed to investigate the Metropolitan Correctional Center\u2019s \u201cfailure\u201d to secure Epstein. \u201cWe are now learning of serious irregularities at this facility that are deeply concerning and demand a thorough investigation,\u201d Barr said. \u201cWe will get to the bottom of it, and there will be accountability.\u201d Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard will be away from the campaign trail for two weeks as she reports for active duty in Indonesia. The Hawaii congresswoman is a veteran of the Iraq War and has served two tours of duty in the Middle East. Trump\u2019s former communications director, Anthony Scaramucci, said this morning that he no longer supports the president\u2019s re-election bid. Our colleague Edward Helmore reports: On Monday, Scaramucci was asked by CNN whether he was \u2018no longer an active supporter of President Trump and his re-election bid?\u2019 Scaramucci replied: \u2018I think that\u2019s pretty obvious from over the weekend.\u2019 Asked if he was calling for a change to the Republican nomination for president, Scaramucci said: \u2018Well, I\u2019m calling for it to be considered, yes.\u2019 Scaramucci introduced that theme on Sunday, telling Axios: \u2018We are now in the early episodes of Chernobyl on HBO, where the reactor is melting down and the apparatchiks are trying to figure out whether to cover it up or start the clean-up process.\u2019 He went on: \u2018A couple more weeks like this and \u2018country over party\u2019 is going to require the Republicans to replace the top of the ticket in 2020. We can\u2019t afford a full nuclear contamination site post-2020.\u2019 Trump attacked Scaramucci in a series of tweets at the weekend, in which he said his fellow New Yorker had been \u2018totally incapable of handling\u2019 his position in the White House and accused him of knowing \u2018very little about me\u2019. Asked about Scaramucci\u2019s comments, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said the former communications director was no expert on the president, citing his 11-day tenure in the position. \u201cThis is all so self-serving on his part, and the media plays right into it,\u201d Grisham said. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing to watch.\u201d The Trump administration has other major policy changes in the works as well. Officials are reportedly finalizing changes to the Endangered Species Act that experts fear will drive more plants and animals to extinction. The AP reports: The Trump administration says the changes will make regulation more efficient and less burdensome while preserving protections for wildlife. At least 10 attorneys general joined conservation groups in protesting an early draft of the changes, saying they put more wildlife at greater risk of extinction. A draft version of the changes released last year included ending blanket protections for animals newly deemed threatened and allowing federal authorities for the first time to consider the economic cost of protecting a particular species. Another change could let authorities disregard impacts from climate change, one of the largest threats to habitat, conservation groups said. The final rule broadly sticks to those changes, according to a person briefed on the changes who was not authorized to publicly speak about them. Conservationists promised legal action. A New York Times reporter noted that, since the \u201cpublic charge rule\u201d was first drafted, many immigrants she has interviewed have emphasized that they do not use public benefits: It\u2019s worth noting that the new Trump administration policy penalizing green card applicants who use public benefits affects legal immigration. The president has consistently used vitriolic language to describe illegal immigration, promising his supporters that he will curb the number of crossings at the US-Mexico border. But his administration has also pursued a number of avenues to cut the number of legal immigrants to the country, including slashing the number of refugee admissions and now penalizing green card applicants who use food stamps or Medicaid. The overall intended effect seems to be a chilling reduction in the number of immigrants to America --regardless of their legal status. One reporter asked Ken Cuccinelli whether the new rule penalizing green card applicants who use public benefits flew in the face of the plaque at the Statue of Liberty, which reads \u201cGive me your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.\u201d The reporter asked the acting USCIS director if that plaque should be amended given the implications of this new policy. \u201cI\u2019m certainly not prepared to take anything down off the Statue of Liberty,\u201d Cuccinelli replied. Ken Cuccinelli said that \u201ccriminal investigations\u201d remain ongoing from recent Ice raids of workplaces. About 680 immigrants, most of them Latino, were arrested last week in a series of raids at Mississippi food-processing plants. It marked the largest ever Ice sweep conducted in a single state. Ken Cuccinelli said he \u201ccan\u2019t imagine\u201d the Trump administration would eliminate the refugee admission program, noting that Congress would need to make such a change. Politico reported last month that some Trump administration officials have been pushing to slash the number of refugee admissions to zero. Ken Cuccinelli said the new policy penalizing green card applicants who use public benefits is \u201creenforcing the ideals of self-sufficiency and personal responsibility.\u201d The acting director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services previously told Fox News that the new rule would \u201chave the long-term benefit of protecting taxpayers by ensuring people who are immigrating to this country don\u2019t become public burdens, that they can stand on their own two feet, as immigrants in years past have done.\u201d Cuccinelli also cited his family\u2019s own immigration story from Italy as an example of that \u201cself-sufficiency.\u201d Ken Cuccinelli, the acting director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services, is holding a press briefing at the White House to announce the new policy penalizing green card applicants who use public benefits. According to the Urban Institute, 1 in 7 adults in immigrant families are eschewing public benefits out of fear that it could affect their chances of getting a green card. Respondents of the organization\u2019s survey reported choosing not to enroll or even disenrolling from programs like food stamps and Medicaid. Researchers found that not receiving public benefits in turn caused financial difficulties as well as mental and physical health problems. The Trump administration has introduced a new policy that could penalize green card applicants who use public benefits, such as food stamps. BuzzFeed News reports: The policy will take effect in about two months, according to a filing of the policy in the Federal Register. The proposed version of the rule was released in September, and it received thousands of public comments online, many of which were critical of the policy. ... The Immigration and Nationality Act has long allowed the government to deny permanent residency to immigrants who were determined to be a financial burden on society or a \u2018public charge\u2019 \u2014 meaning they\u2019re dependent on the government for financial support. The new rule would alter how the government decides if someone is a public charge. Last year, researchers said the proposed version of the rule would have a serious impact on immigrants, regardless of whether they were impacted by the policy. \u2018Numerous studies, by MPI and others, have found the rule would result in disenrollment from public benefits programs by many immigrants, including those not directly affected by the rule, as well as U.S.-born dependents,\u2019 read a report released by the Migration Policy Institute. \u2018Already, there are anecdotal reports by service providers of people disenrolling from public benefit programs amid fear or confusion about the rule.\u2019 Good morning, live blog readers! The biggest news of the day remains Jeffrey Epstein, the multimillionaire financier facing sex-trafficking charges who died of an apparent suicide on Saturday. His death has raised numerous questions about how the jail could have allowed such an event to occur. The New York City medical examiner\u2019s office completed its autopsy yesterday but said it needed more information before finalizing a cause of death. But sources say there are no indications of foul play and that suicide remains the most likely cause of death. And yet that hasn\u2019t stopped many -- including the president -- from promoting conspiracy theories about Epstein\u2019s death. With the Justice Department opening an investigation into the circumstances of the apparent suicide, much more will likely be learned in the weeks and months to come. Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping its eye on: Donald Trump is still on vacation in Bedminster, New Jersey, with no events on his public schedule, so keep an eye on his Twitter feed. Ken Cuccinelli, the acting director of the Citizenship and Immigration Services office, will give a press briefing at the White House at 10 a.m. EDT. Today marks two years since the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, and the death of counterprotester Heather Heyer. Stay tuned.",
