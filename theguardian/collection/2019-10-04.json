      "bodyText": "House Democrats have subpoenaed the White House demanding documents that could shed light on Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine, in the latest escalation of their impeachment investigation into the president and his administration. The move comes as the senior Democrats also formally requested documents relating to Ukraine dealings from Mike Pence, the vice-president. The subpoena, issued late Friday, follows numerous appeals for the White House to produce documents voluntarily. The letter, addressed to the acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, and signed by representatives Elijah Cummings, Adam Schiff and Eliot Engel, accuses the president of \u201cstonewalling\u201d and says they were left \u201cwith no choice\u201d but to subpoena. \u201cIt appears clear that the president has chosen the path of defiance, obstruction, and cover-up,\u201d the letter reads, warning that failure to comply \u2013 even at the direction of the president \u2013 \u201cshall constitute evidence of obstruction of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry\u201d. The House investigators also want Pence to give them documents that could shed light on whether he helped Trump pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, the former vice-president and leading Democratic candidate for the 2020 nomination. Another letter sent earlier by Schiff, Cummings and Engel \u2013 the chairs, respectively, of the House intelligence, oversight and foreign affairs committees \u2013 cites reports that a Pence aide may have listened to the 25 July phone call in which Trump pushed Ukraine\u2019s new president \u2013 who was waiting for hundreds of millions of dollars of US military aid that had been withheld \u2013 to investigate unfounded charges that Biden was involved in corrupt activities there. The chairmen say they also want to learn more about a meeting Pence had on 1 September with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president. The letter says there are \u201cquestions about any role you may have played in conveying or reinforcing the president\u2019s stark message to the Ukrainian president\u201d. The development came as Trump said the White House was also preparing a letter \u2013 this one to the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi. Its intention is to formally object to the Democrats commencing their impeachment inquiry without an official vote on it in Congress \u2013 but admits that if a vote were held he believes it would pass.

Trump, senior Republicans and prominent conservative media figures are either counter-attacking or remaining silent. Most Republican senators remained quiet on Friday, but the 2012 presidential candidate and current Utah senator Mitt Romney issued a statement that said \u201cthe president\u2019s brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling\u201d. As the impeachment scandal continues to escalate, the House intelligence committee, one of six that are holding impeachment hearings into Trump\u2019s conduct, questioned the intelligence community inspector general, Michael Atkinson, behind closed doors. Republicans are aggressively questioning the absence of an official vote on impeachment prior to the inquiry formally beginning. In announcing that the House was beginning the investigation, Pelosi did not seek the consent of the full chamber, as was done for impeachment investigations into former presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. Pelosi swatted it back as unnecessary, saying the House is well within its rules to pursue the inquiry without taking a vote. \u201cThe existing rules of the House provide House committees with full authority to conduct investigations for all matters under their jurisdiction, including impeachment investigations,\u201d Pelosi wrote Thursday in a letter to the House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy after he, too, pressed for a floor vote. Pelosi has sought to avoid a vote on the impeachment inquiry for the same reason she resisted, for months, liberal calls to try to remove the president: it would force moderate House Democrats to make a politically risky vote.

This is real hope, so many people gathering on a weekday at such short notice. This is real hope to me,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Biggers has spent the last six months mobilizing fellow students to pressure the city council into adopting more stringent measures to address climate change.</p> <p>\u201cAt the time our specific goal was to get the school board to pass a climate resolution,\u201d he said in an interview with the Guardian. \u201cBut then it was pretty easy to get the school board to get a climate resolution so we went to the city council and now we\u2019re trying to get the coal fired [power] plant shut down,\u201d he added.</p> <p>The University of Iowa burns coal at its power plant, providing a clear target for the young activists who lead the crowd in regular chants of \u201cEnd Coal Now!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTo be part of a global movement and especially at this stage, it\u2019s just an amazing, amazing opportunity to see a global leader,\u201d said Abbey Jordahl, a freshman at UI from Ankeny, Iowa. \u201cHonestly I couldn\u2019t believe it when I read that Greta was coming here, I was like \u2026 Iowa City?!

I just kind of shut off the brain,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Explaining why she believes she is now on the receiving end of criticism from world leaders like Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, she suggested: \u201cThey do it because they see something that is threatening and they want to silence that and if they don\u2019t have anything else to say, if they can\u2019t criticize the science, which is all we are saying, then they start attacking us personally and sending threats and hate and so on so maybe they can\u2019t cope with it.</p> <p>\u201cIt could definitely be they feel threatened by a new generation,\u201d she added \u201cThere is a lot of young people especially young girls in this movement who are leading and maybe they don\u2019t like that, I don\u2019t know!\u201d</p> <p>Claire Carlson, a senior studying geoscience, environmental science and business at UI from Ottumwa had joined friends from the Environmental Science Club at the rally. \u201cIts nice to finally see a large group of people come together and address the problem,\u201d she said. \u201cI think Greta\u2019s done a really good job of bringing a voice to that especially at a really young age. I think it means that more people are starting to understand the need for impactful legislation with regards to climate change.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"899d555c36dda1918c901bfdcc8b9d9f949576c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/899d555c36dda1918c901bfdcc8b9d9f949576c1/0_76_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"More than 3,000 people gathered in the shadow of the University of Iowa on Friday afternoon to hear Thunberg speak.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">More than 3,000 people gathered in the shadow of the University of Iowa on Friday afternoon to hear Thunberg speak.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Acker/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Carlson, like her friend Emma Hartke, will be able to caucus next February for a Democratic candidate. \u201cI think <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/elizabeth-warren\">Elizabeth Warren</a> has a really good plan for climate change,\u201d said Hartke. Carlson favours the young mayor from South Bend, Indiana, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pete-buttigieg\">Pete Buttigieg</a>, but Warren is the name on most people\u2019s lips when asked which way they\u2019re currently leaning.</p> <p>\u201cThere are still some centrists who like to play both sides on climate \u2026 such as Joe Biden,\u201d said Derek Torres who has moved to Iowa City from Atlanta. \u201cThey always speak in terms of jobs \u2026 but if there\u2019s no air or water there\u2019s no jobs,\u201d he reasoned.</p> <p>Thunberg has become adept at using Twitter to spread her message, but does she enjoy using it? \u201cYes and no,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of it is just meaningless.

The University of Iowa burns coal at its power plant, providing a clear target for the young activists who lead the crowd in regular chants of \u201cEnd Coal Now!\u201d \u201cTo be part of a global movement and especially at this stage, it\u2019s just an amazing, amazing opportunity to see a global leader,\u201d said Abbey Jordahl, a freshman at UI from Ankeny, Iowa. \u201cHonestly I couldn\u2019t believe it when I read that Greta was coming here, I was like \u2026 Iowa City?! What?! I\u2019ve been following her for a while, honestly I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m here!\u201d Thunberg rallied an enthusiastic, young crowd, flush with high school and university students, many of whom had made their own signs to greet her. \u201cRight now the world leaders keep acting like children and somebody needs to be the adult in the room,\u201d she said, referencing her speech at the United Nations in New York the previous week. Thunberg said afterwards that she doesn\u2019t like being the centre of attention. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to get used to,\u201d she admitted, \u201cbut it\u2019s something I have to do and I can\u2019t really complain. I just kind of shut off the brain,\u201d she said. Explaining why she believes she is now on the receiving end of criticism from world leaders like Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, she suggested: \u201cThey do it because they see something that is threatening and they want to silence that and if they don\u2019t have anything else to say, if they can\u2019t criticize the science, which is all we are saying, then they start attacking us personally and sending threats and hate and so on so maybe they can\u2019t cope with it. \u201cIt could definitely be they feel threatened by a new generation,\u201d she added \u201cThere is a lot of young people especially young girls in this movement who are leading and maybe they don\u2019t like that, I don\u2019t know!\u201d Claire Carlson, a senior studying geoscience, environmental science and business at UI from Ottumwa had joined friends from the Environmental Science Club at the rally. \u201cIts nice to finally see a large group of people come together and address the problem,\u201d she said. \u201cI think Greta\u2019s done a really good job of bringing a voice to that especially at a really young age. I think it means that more people are starting to understand the need for impactful legislation with regards to climate change.\u201d Carlson, like her friend Emma Hartke, will be able to caucus next February for a Democratic candidate. \u201cI think Elizabeth Warren has a really good plan for climate change,\u201d said Hartke. Carlson favours the young mayor from South Bend, Indiana, Pete Buttigieg, but Warren is the name on most people\u2019s lips when asked which way they\u2019re currently leaning. \u201cThere are still some centrists who like to play both sides on climate \u2026 such as Joe Biden,\u201d said Derek Torres who has moved to Iowa City from Atlanta. \u201cThey always speak in terms of jobs \u2026 but if there\u2019s no air or water there\u2019s no jobs,\u201d he reasoned. Thunberg has become adept at using Twitter to spread her message, but does she enjoy using it? \u201cYes and no,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of it is just meaningless. And people wanting to brag about themselves or whatever, lots of hate, trolls, anonymous people who have separate accounts.\u201d But she admitted she does enjoy updating her tagline. \u201cYou need to have fun as well,\u201d she joked.",

The Department for Education (DfE) said that from 2020, new teachers with degrees in physics or chemistry, or in languages such as French or Spanish, would join those with maths degrees in being eligible for \u201cearly-career payments\u201d if they worked in state schools in England for four years after completing their training.

When combined with training bursaries worth \u00a326,000, graduates with at least a second-class degree in those subjects will get up to \u00a335,000. The recruitment drive comes as England\u2019s secondary schools are to gain increased numbers of pupils from the boom in births in the late-2000s, with the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, announcing the government\u2019s aim of boosting teachers\u2019 starting salaries to \u00a330,000 by 2022. \u201cI want both the brightest and the best talent to be drawn to the teaching profession and for schools to compete with the biggest employers in the labour market,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cThe bursaries we are announcing, along with the 2.75% pay rise for all teachers and school leaders this academic year, will do just that, while ensuring that those who stay in the classroom will benefit most.\u201d The government said it had committed more than \u00a3250m in financial incentives to encourage graduates to enter the classroom and remain there, following an earlier pledge as part of the DfE\u2019s recruitment strategy to use its bursary system to improve the retention rate of teachers. The expansion of early-career payments follows research that bursaries alone have failed to improve teacher retention rates. A DfE study published last year found that graduates receiving \u00a326,000 bursaries were slightly less likely to go on to teaching than those receiving no incentives. Graduates with maths and physics degrees are among the most sought-after in the labour market, and careers requiring those degrees regularly command the highest starting salaries.

Neither the Turkish club nor the player consider such a deal to be likely, meaning Karius will return to Liverpool, where his contract runs until 2021, or join another club.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/19/europa-league-roundup-dudelange-apoel-lazio-cluj-psv-sporting-roma\">Europa League: Karius drops clanger in Besiktas defeat, Dudelange shock Apoel</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI have a loan until the end of the season and then I will see, back to Liverpool or somewhere else in England or somewhere in Germany, you never know,\u201d said Karius after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/03/besiktas-wolves-europa-league-match-report\" title=\"\">1-0 defeat by Wolves</a> in the Europa League on Thursday. \u201cRight now my focus is on playing games here every week and then we\u2019ll see.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed my time here. Of course if you play in England you are a bit more in the spotlight, but it\u2019s a good club here, of course with some problems now and then. It was not always easy the last year and a bit since I\u2019m here but overall the first season was quite good. The Premier League is the best league so it\u2019s interesting of course but also I am still under contract at Liverpool, so maybe I\u2019ll play for Liverpool again, you never know.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to say now. If it\u2019s not Liverpool it will be another decent team I am sure, so I am not worried.\u201d</p> <p>The 26-year-old said he had put his Champions League misfortune out of his mind and was not bothered if people doubt the explanation for his errors that emerged after the defeat to Real Madrid: that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/04/concussion-loris-karius-liverpool-goalkeeper-champions-league-final-massachusetts\" title=\"\">he had been concussed</a> in a collision with Sergio Ramos. \u201cI don\u2019t think about it any more, it was so long ago, nearly two seasons,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were so many circumstances; I had a bad injury and nobody was talking about it.

      "bodyText": "Loris Karius says he has put his 2018 Champions League calamity behind him and retains hope of playing again for Liverpool \u2013 or another Premier League team \u2013 following his loan stint at Besiktas. The German has not appeared for J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team since making two ghastly errors in the 2018 Champions League final, after which the club moved decisively to buy an upgrade, paying a world record fee for a goalkeeper to sign Allison from Roma. That appeared to signal the end of Karius\u2019s career at Anfield, as later that summer he left on a two-year loan to Besiktas, who have an option to make the transfer permanent at the end of this season for \u00a37.25m. Neither the Turkish club nor the player consider such a deal to be likely, meaning Karius will return to Liverpool, where his contract runs until 2021, or join another club. \u201cI have a loan until the end of the season and then I will see, back to Liverpool or somewhere else in England or somewhere in Germany, you never know,\u201d said Karius after a 1-0 defeat by Wolves in the Europa League on Thursday. \u201cRight now my focus is on playing games here every week and then we\u2019ll see. \u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed my time here. Of course if you play in England you are a bit more in the spotlight, but it\u2019s a good club here, of course with some problems now and then. It was not always easy the last year and a bit since I\u2019m here but overall the first season was quite good. The Premier League is the best league so it\u2019s interesting of course but also I am still under contract at Liverpool, so maybe I\u2019ll play for Liverpool again, you never know. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to say now. If it\u2019s not Liverpool it will be another decent team I am sure, so I am not worried.\u201d The 26-year-old said he had put his Champions League misfortune out of his mind and was not bothered if people doubt the explanation for his errors that emerged after the defeat to Real Madrid: that he had been concussed in a collision with Sergio Ramos. \u201cI don\u2019t think about it any more, it was so long ago, nearly two seasons,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were so many circumstances; I had a bad injury and nobody was talking about it. People can say what they want \u2013 it doesn\u2019t really concern me any more. \u201cAfter they assessed it we realised [the concussion] but in the game you have too much adrenaline to realise. It\u2019s in the past. I\u2019m happy they won it a year after. I still speak to the goalkeeping coach and some other players. They have a good chance again this year.\u201d If he were not in Turkey, Karius might have been recalled to the Liverpool team following Alisson\u2019s injury at the start of this season; instead Adri\u00e1n, a free agent signed in August, has filled the temporary vacancy. Karius suggests it must be a pleasure to play behind a defence that has made big progress since he left. \u201cThe defence has improved brilliantly over the last season and a bit \u2013 they rarely concede goals any more,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery goalkeeper would feel comfortable behind that defence but [Adri\u00e1n] is doing a good job \u2026 [The defence] was solid even back when I was there but now it\u2019s on another level, the whole team has improved. The longer that people are together, the more it fits.\u201d Karius\u2019 time at Besiktas has not been plain sailing.

When you lose that type of player it makes it difficult for the rest of the squad and we didn\u2019t quite replace that.

Insiders say Rodgers reacted to the news with \u201cincredible dignity\u201d, then offered to let his successor J\u00fcrgen Klopp move into his house. Rodgers: \u201cI told them, \u2018Listen, I\u2019m moving to London for a bit, so J\u00fcrgen can move in\u2019. And he did. I was never going to be bitter. I wanted him to succeed. I want the club to succeed.\u201d</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cObviously the disappointment was not being able to sustain it but sometimes that\u2019s how it works out for you. You learn from that. We were in a similar situation here at Leicester in the summer. We lost one of our top players when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/05/harry-maguire-joins-manchester-united-as-worlds-most-expensive-defender\" title=\"\">Harry [Maguire] went to Manchester United</a> but the experience back then helps me deal with this better. You know you have to do the best for the player and the club and if he ends up going then don\u2019t take it personally. You make sure the team is stronger for it. It maybe didn\u2019t work out for us back then but it helped me moving forward.\u201d</p> \n<p>And does he allow himself to think of what might have been but for that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/27/liverpool-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">infamous slip-up against Chelsea </a>during the 2013-14 title race? \u201cJust from time to time; I don\u2019t burden myself with it,\u201d Rodgers says. \u201cI believe we did everything we possibly could but fell short. We were second and had an opportunity to win but didn\u2019t take it \u2013 it\u2019s as simple as that. Over the course of 38 games, if you don\u2019t win the league you don\u2019t deserve to win it. We have so many happy memories from that season. But do I think about it? Yes, from time to time it will come to me.\u201d</p> \n<p>Recruitment was a recurring problem during Rodgers\u2019 time at Liverpool, with the young, driven manager often at odds with the transfer committee that has worked so successfully alongside Klopp. And it is here, perhaps more than in any other facet of management, that Rodgers differs from the 39-year-old who walked into one of the biggest jobs in world football in 2012. FSG\u2019s restrictions on the age of transfer targets was one source of irritation for the former Liverpool manager, who wanted to exchange Jordan Henderson for Fulham\u2019s Clint Dempsey at the start of his tenure. Pushing for Christian Benteke, while appearing unsure how best to maximise the glorious gifts of Roberto Firmino, was another head-scratcher during Rodgers\u2019 reign. The conflict, he maintains, would not happen now.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWhat experience has given me is I\u2019m much more relaxed now on that front,\u201d he says of transfers. \u201cMy strengths are managing players and coaching players. As a modern manager at the top level it\u2019s very difficult to have the time to go out looking at players. I know what my strengths are, and when I come into a club I try to make it clear in terms of the type of game I want to play. Then you put your trust in your recruitment team and the club to get the players in.</p> \n<p>\u201cGoing back to Liverpool, I think it was a learning aspect. I was a young manager back then and the board were new to it as well. We had a strategy and that was how they worked and I was part of the process. You couldn\u2019t see whether it would work or not. But afterwards they knew they could spend on a senior player or a top goalkeeper, and of course that clearly helped, but you have to go through that process of learning.\u201d Everyone, it appears, is better for it.</p>",

We were second and had an opportunity to win but didn\u2019t take it \u2013 it\u2019s as simple as that. Over the course of 38 games, if you don\u2019t win the league you don\u2019t deserve to win it. We have so many happy memories from that season. But do I think about it? Yes, from time to time it will come to me.\u201d Recruitment was a recurring problem during Rodgers\u2019 time at Liverpool, with the young, driven manager often at odds with the transfer committee that has worked so successfully alongside Klopp. And it is here, perhaps more than in any other facet of management, that Rodgers differs from the 39-year-old who walked into one of the biggest jobs in world football in 2012. FSG\u2019s restrictions on the age of transfer targets was one source of irritation for the former Liverpool manager, who wanted to exchange Jordan Henderson for Fulham\u2019s Clint Dempsey at the start of his tenure. Pushing for Christian Benteke, while appearing unsure how best to maximise the glorious gifts of Roberto Firmino, was another head-scratcher during Rodgers\u2019 reign. The conflict, he maintains, would not happen now. \u201cWhat experience has given me is I\u2019m much more relaxed now on that front,\u201d he says of transfers. \u201cMy strengths are managing players and coaching players. As a modern manager at the top level it\u2019s very difficult to have the time to go out looking at players. I know what my strengths are, and when I come into a club I try to make it clear in terms of the type of game I want to play. Then you put your trust in your recruitment team and the club to get the players in. \u201cGoing back to Liverpool, I think it was a learning aspect. I was a young manager back then and the board were new to it as well. We had a strategy and that was how they worked and I was part of the process. You couldn\u2019t see whether it would work or not. But afterwards they knew they could spend on a senior player or a top goalkeeper, and of course that clearly helped, but you have to go through that process of learning.\u201d Everyone, it appears, is better for it.",

Bruce always maintains teams are only as good as their strikers but during the summer Newcastle lost Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n \u2013 whose ability to hold the ball up offered an important outlet \u2013 and Ayoze P\u00e9rez. With the \u00a340m Brazilian forward Joelinton still acclimatising, they are the Premier League\u2019s joint-lowest scorers and, damningly, have had the fewest shots and least amount of possession \u2013 a median 33%.</p> <p>This ball-shy, playing-on-the-break mindset has long been Newcastle\u2019s default mode.

At times the squad probably felt like schoolchildren from past generations reciting their maths tables but the respect for the serial trophy-winning Spaniard was such that they fully bought into a regime many now appear to be pining for. Although Bruce is widely liked, some senior professionals are said to miss Ben\u00edtez\u2019s clarity, micro-management and solid, carefully structured, tactical framework. \u201cThe players are with me,\u201d said the current manager, firmly. \u201cThere\u2019s no dispute about that.\u201d Even so, they had clearly become a little demotivated, if not bewildered. \u201cI understand the coach was trying to explain some kind of style he wanted us to do at Leicester,\u201d said Martin Dubravka, the goalkeeper. \u201cBut unfortunately it didn\u2019t work. It was embarrassing. Nobody spoke on the flight home. The plane was silent. It was horrible.\u201d It would be naive to suggest that, by flicking a switch and reverting to Ben\u00edtez\u2019s philosophy, all will be well. Bruce always maintains teams are only as good as their strikers but during the summer Newcastle lost Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n \u2013 whose ability to hold the ball up offered an important outlet \u2013 and Ayoze P\u00e9rez. With the \u00a340m Brazilian forward Joelinton still acclimatising, they are the Premier League\u2019s joint-lowest scorers and, damningly, have had the fewest shots and least amount of possession \u2013 a median 33%. This ball-shy, playing-on-the-break mindset has long been Newcastle\u2019s default mode. Alan Pardew joked about his side often looking \u201cmore dangerous without the ball than with it\u201d, and Steve McClaren\u2019s attempts to introduce a patient passing style led to the sack and relegation. Bruce\u2019s challenge is to avoid both but his chances of staying in office longer than the current prime minister remain opaque. \u201cMud\u2019s been thrown my way since I walked through the door,\u201d said a man who looked close to tears at Leicester. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be human if it didn\u2019t affect youbut I\u2019m a resilient so and so. I\u2019m determined to turn it round.\u201d",

A fortnight ago when Salford were beaten here in Wigan and forced to take the long road to Old Trafford their incredible underdog story looked to be reaching its conclusion. But this group of misfits \u2013 the majority of whom were released by other clubs \u2013 have made a habit of defying the critics in 2019.</p> <p>The second-lowest spenders in Super League only just survived on the final day last year, so preseason predictions of a relegation struggle were fully merited, or so we thought. Yet here, it was Salford who looked like seasoned Super League champions, and Wigan the perennial strugglers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/27/st-helens-wigan-super-league-match-report\">St Helens storm into Grand Final after seven-try blitz blows Wigan away</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The scale of this victory is underlined by the fact it was only Salford\u2019s fourth at Wigan in 40 years. The prize for this near-faultless performance? A maiden appearance in the Super League Grand Final. If you had said in January this would happen you would have been met with utter derision. \u201cWe\u2019ve got players who\u2019ve been moved on from the big clubs but are now Grand Finalists,\u201d their coach, Ian Watson said. Watson has cemented his reputation as the best young British coach in the game as he has driven this incredible story. \u201cWe\u2019re not happy we\u2019re there \u2013 we\u2019re going to win it,\u201d he said afterwards.</p> <p>Salford were beaten here 18-12 two weeks ago but a similar outcome never looked likely on a one-sided night.

      "bodyText": "Maybe, just maybe, dreams do come true after all. A fortnight ago when Salford were beaten here in Wigan and forced to take the long road to Old Trafford their incredible underdog story looked to be reaching its conclusion. But this group of misfits \u2013 the majority of whom were released by other clubs \u2013 have made a habit of defying the critics in 2019. The second-lowest spenders in Super League only just survived on the final day last year, so preseason predictions of a relegation struggle were fully merited, or so we thought. Yet here, it was Salford who looked like seasoned Super League champions, and Wigan the perennial strugglers. The scale of this victory is underlined by the fact it was only Salford\u2019s fourth at Wigan in 40 years. The prize for this near-faultless performance? A maiden appearance in the Super League Grand Final. If you had said in January this would happen you would have been met with utter derision. \u201cWe\u2019ve got players who\u2019ve been moved on from the big clubs but are now Grand Finalists,\u201d their coach, Ian Watson said. Watson has cemented his reputation as the best young British coach in the game as he has driven this incredible story. \u201cWe\u2019re not happy we\u2019re there \u2013 we\u2019re going to win it,\u201d he said afterwards. Salford were beaten here 18-12 two weeks ago but a similar outcome never looked likely on a one-sided night. They led 12-0 at half-time thanks to a Gil Dudson try and four goals from Krisnan Inu. Both were in the Widnes side who were relegated last season. The first try after half-time felt decisive, and when Joey Lussick got it for Salford to make it 18-0, the Warriors looked well beaten. \u201cWe\u2019ve been great in the second half of the year, but it went from bad to worse here,\u201d the Wigan coach Adrian Lam conceded. Salford\u2019s heroic defensive efforts played a part in keeping Wigan scoreless for over 70 minutes, but the hosts\u2019 out-of-sorts attack was the real reason why the defence of their title came to such a shuddering halt in front of their own fans. As Lam pointed out post-match, the emergence of several young players in 2019 is a plus for them long-term, but failure to make the Grand Final makes this season a failure. And by the time Wigan had scored their one and only try through Bevan French, Salford\u2019s place at Old Trafford had long been guaranteed. Another penalty from the reliable Inu made it 20-0, before two of their supposed misfits, Dudson and Lee Mossop, combined to send the latter over, with Inu\u2019s goal establishing a 26-point lead. Salford\u2019s 5,000-strong travelling support, who only have to venture four miles down the road next Saturday, were in fine voice all night, but that try marked the moment when they could genuinely relax and believe a first title in 43 years could be theirs. Another Inu penalty was the icing on the cake, and French\u2019s consolation was greeted by ironic cheers from the Salford fans; most of the home supporters had already left. Underdog stories do not get much bigger than this. In 1976 it was the likes of Keith Fielden and David Watkins who brought the title back to Salford. Next Saturday, a new set of heroes could be crowned at Old Trafford. Expect it to be loud: the people of Salford have waited a long, long time for this moment.

The almanacs\u2019 winter predictions differ considerably in detail, with the Farmer\u2019s Almanac suggesting a \u201cpolar coaster\u201d of highs and lows worst in the east. Whatever happens, it is likely that successes will be remembered and failures ignored. This human tendency, known as confirmation bias, may do more to keep almanacs in business than the reliability of their secret formulae.",

McLaughlin is only 20 yet she is already breathing down the 29 year-old\u2019s neck and one day soon she will reign. But it\u2019s always nice when the champion, the one who was never a prodigy and who gradually rose to the top, somehow manages to hold off the inevitable for one more year.</p> <p>And then there was Mutaz Essa Barshim. He arrived to defend his title at his home world championships after undergoing ankle surgery, jumping an average 2.29 season best and with no reason to expect a win. But when you are a champion, none of those things matter. The Qatari high jumper rose to the biggest occasion of his life and he will never forget this great night.

Welcome to day 8 of the World Athletics Championships in Doha.</strong> We begin today with the men\u2019s 1500 metres semi-final round, where the red-hot Timothy Cheruiyot is favourite to win the title and 19 year-old Jakob Ingebrigtsen will look to make a statement. British hopes will rest on Josh Kerr, Jake Wightman and Neil Gourley. In the men\u2019s high jump final, Qatar\u2019s Mutaz Barshim will be desperate to defend his title in front of a home crowd. Sandra Perkovic will be looking to claim an incredible third world discus title.</p> <p>Tonight will also be the first 4x100 metres relay night. Remember those desperate days when just the thought of British teams trying to get the baton round would fill the nation with dread? No more. Great Britain\u2019s men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams will be looking to repeat one of the glorious athletics evenings of this country\u2019s history when the women took silver and the men won gold within 20 minutes of each other in the Olympic Stadium in 2017.</p> <p>The track finals tonight will include a showdown between Dalilah Muhammad and Sydney McLaughlin of the United States in the women\u2019s 400 metres hurdles, which seems to be set up in a similar manner to the ballistic women\u2019s 400 metres final yesterday. Muhammad\u2019s glorious 52.20 world record set this year could either fall to McLaughlin or be extended by its owner.<br></p> <p>The night will conclude with the men\u2019s 3000 metres steeplechase final, before the men\u2019s 400 metres final takes centre stage. Fred Kerley of the United States will be the favourite after his brilliant 43.64 this year. Steven Gardiner and Kirani James will hope to have something to stay about that.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-04T17:04:01.557Z\">at 6.04pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "After another magical night in Doha, that\u2019s all from me. Of all the rousing performances, it was particularly striking to see Dalilah Muhammad hold off Sydney McLaughlin in the 400 metres hurdles with her second world record of the year. McLaughlin is only 20 yet she is already breathing down the 29 year-old\u2019s neck and one day soon she will reign. But it\u2019s always nice when the champion, the one who was never a prodigy and who gradually rose to the top, somehow manages to hold off the inevitable for one more year. And then there was Mutaz Essa Barshim. He arrived to defend his title at his home world championships after undergoing ankle surgery, jumping an average 2.29 season best and with no reason to expect a win. But when you are a champion, none of those things matter. The Qatari high jumper rose to the biggest occasion of his life and he will never forget this great night. Until next time. Do read Barney Ronay on Sebastian Coe\u2019s response to Alberto Salazar\u2019s ban. Another day of drama comes to an end: In the women\u2019s 400 metres hurdles, we saw Muhammad run her own race to a world record. This time, Gardiner could see all of his biggest rivals from the inside lane and he used them to time his run to perfection, blowing through the opening 200 metres and establishing his lead before holding on to win. As his rivals faltered, he was still distancing himself in the final 50 metres. Gardiner\u2019s previous personal best was 43.87. What a time to smash it with an incredible 43.48 second run. Steven Gardiner of the Bahamas wins the men\u2019s 400 metres title with a national record of 43.48. Anthony Jose Zambrano of Colombia takes second and Fred Kerley wins the bronze. Finally, it\u2019s time for the men\u2019s 400 metres final. Fred Kerley of the United States will begin as favourite. Can Kirani James or Steven Gardiner catch him? Also, who will the 800 metre runner Emmanuel Korir embarrass today? Yaime Perez of Cuba wins the discus with a great throw of 69.17m. Her countrywoman Denia Caballero takes second with 68.44m. Former champion Sandra Perkovic has to settle for third. Mutaz Essa Barshim of Qatar just became the first man to defend a high jump world title, leaping into form in front of a home crowd. Neutral athletes Mikhail Akimenko and Ilya Ivanyuk take second and third. Golden girl Katarina Johnson-Thompson is in the BBC Studio: I knew that I was in the shape of my life. I knew that coming into this I had the best prep ever. This is absurd. Mutaz Essa Barshim now clears 2.37m at the first attempt to move into first place. After ankle surgery last year and a previous season best of just 2.29m, he has jumped himself into form in front of his home crowd. A champion. Conseslus Kipruto of Kenya defends his 3000 metres steeplechase title with a time of 8:01.35, stealing the gold right on the line. What an incredible race. After the Ethiopians set the high pace early on, it was the 18 year-old Lamecha Girma who broke through and powered into the lead with about 120 metres to go. It looked like he had it, but at the very last second the Kenyan reeled him in. Girma finished with a valiant national record of 8:01.36, just a hundredth of a second separating them. Soufiane El Bakkali of Morocco takes third in 8:01.36. Defending champion Barshim clears a world leading 2.35m at his first attempt! The crowd explodes once more and you can\u2019t blame them. No man has ever defended the high jump world title but the home star just put himself in a great position. Chala Beyo and Gentet Wale of Ethiopia have started this steeplechase final leading from the front at an extremely fast pace. Soufiane El Bakkali, Benjamin Kigen and Conseslus Kipruto will all be looking for medals in this very open final. It\u2019s time for the men\u2019s 3000 metres steeplechase final. Meanwhile, the first packed crowd of the championships just exploded as Qatar\u2019s Mutaz Essa Barshim clears 2.33 at his third attempt. A season best for the defending champion and he is loving it. McLaughlin is a great competitor and will be disappointed. However, it must be nice to know that, at 20 years-old, she is the standard. What a race. Muhammad couldn\u2019t see her young rival, so she just set the pace and ran her own race, remaining ahead throughout. 20 year-old McLaughlin finishes in 52.23, just .3 behind the Muhammad\u2019s previous world record. We are looking at two fastest 400 metres hurdlers of all time. Rushell Clayton of Jamaica takes third. Dalilah Muhammad wins gold in the women\u2019s 400 metres with a new world record of 52.16! It\u2019s time for the 400 metres hurdles final. All eyes will be on world record holder Dalilah Muhammad and young sensation Sydney McLaughlin as they battle for gold. Kudos to the many African fans who seem to have really made the atmosphere this year. Meanwhile in the high jump... South Africa win the second relay heat in 37.65 seconds. Japan through in second, China advance in third. The biggest surprise of the heats is Canada failing to reach the final. Poor Andre De Grasse was left with too much to do in the final leg as he desperately attempted to drag his team into the final. In the end, Netherlands took the final spot with a national record of 37.91901 seconds. Canada\u2019s time? 37.91906. Brutal. Adam Gemili is looking in much better spirits: We were looking for redemption, especially me and Zharnell for the individuals not going how we wanted them to. Great Britain ease into the men\u2019s 4x100m final with a great time of 37.56 seconds. Brazil finished in second. What a mess of a race from the United States who finished in third. The men of the 4x100m relays are on the track. The British men will begin in the stacked opening heat, flanked by Jamaica and United States. Meanwhile, Katarina Johnson-Thompson was just on the podium to collect her heptathlon gold medal. What a lovely sight. That was pretty solid from Great Britain. Imani Lansiquot on the second leg and then then Daryll Neita, who moved into second place on the anchor leg were the stands out. Of course, Dina Asher-Smith is to come in the final. Exciting times. Great Britain are safely through to the women\u2019s 4x100 metres final. Jamaica win in 42.11 and China take the third automatic place. Heat two will feature Great Britain. The British team for this round is Asha Philip, Imani Lansiquot, Ashleigh Nelson and Daryll Neita. This is pretty stacked: Jamaica, China, Nigeria and world leaders Germany will also be looking to make the final. The United States quartet are safely through in 42.46 seconds. Trinidad and Tobago take second, Switzerland take third. Spare a thought for the Australian girls as their third runner, Maddie Coates, immediately fell to the ground after taking the baton. There were tears, and for good reason after a huge opportunity missed. It\u2019s time for the women\u2019s 4x100 metres relays. United States, Switzerland, France, Trinidad and Tobago and Netherlands all present. The first three go through. That was a particularly great run from the 21 year-old Kerr. He spent much of the race towards the back of the pack alongside Lewandowski. When the Pole began to make his move in the final lap, Kerr followed him on the outside and accelerated towards the front with around 300 metres to go. By the end, he was looking around and he seems to have plenty more to give. This is the first time three British men have advanced to the men\u2019s 1500 metres final. Can any of them sneak onto the podium? Marcin Lewandowski of Poland wins the second 1500 metres semi-final in 3:36.50. That was some round for the British men, as Josh Kerr qualifies automatically in fourth and Jake Wightman scrapes in seventh. Meanwhile, the men of the high jump final are on the field. The big question is whether defending champion Mutaz Essa Barshim, who has been riddled with injuries this year, can get back onto the podium in front of his home crowd. Otherwise, this will be a very open competition It\u2019s time for the second men\u2019s 1500 metres heat. Olympic champion Matthew Centrowitz of the United States and European champion Jakob Ingebrigtsen line up side by side. Josh Kerr and Jake Wightman will look to join their countryman Gourley in the final. By the way, please do read Sean Ingle on Katarina Johnson-Thompson\u2019s glorious triumph. A thrilled and confident Neil Gourley fancies his chances in the final after a great run just behind the world leader Cheruiyot: \u201cI\u2019m right there. I\u2019m not as far away as you\u2019d think on paper. On paper I\u2019m miles away but in reality it\u2019s not quite like that. You\u2019ll hopefully see that in two nights.\u201d Timothy Cheruiyot wins the first men\u2019s 1500 metres in 3:36.53. But what a run for Britain\u2019s Neil Gourley, who ran a perfect race, placing himself just behind the world leader for much of the race and then showing a strong burst to hold off the pack for third place. It\u2019s time for the men\u2019s 1500 metres. Cheruiyot, Filip Ingebrigtsen and Britain\u2019s Neil Gourley will go in the first semi. The first five advance automatically to the final. Hello! Welcome to day 8 of the World Athletics Championships in Doha. We begin today with the men\u2019s 1500 metres semi-final round, where the red-hot Timothy Cheruiyot is favourite to win the title and 19 year-old Jakob Ingebrigtsen will look to make a statement. British hopes will rest on Josh Kerr, Jake Wightman and Neil Gourley. In the men\u2019s high jump final, Qatar\u2019s Mutaz Barshim will be desperate to defend his title in front of a home crowd. Sandra Perkovic will be looking to claim an incredible third world discus title. Tonight will also be the first 4x100 metres relay night. Remember those desperate days when just the thought of British teams trying to get the baton round would fill the nation with dread? No more. Great Britain\u2019s men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams will be looking to repeat one of the glorious athletics evenings of this country\u2019s history when the women took silver and the men won gold within 20 minutes of each other in the Olympic Stadium in 2017. The track finals tonight will include a showdown between Dalilah Muhammad and Sydney McLaughlin of the United States in the women\u2019s 400 metres hurdles, which seems to be set up in a similar manner to the ballistic women\u2019s 400 metres final yesterday. Muhammad\u2019s glorious 52.20 world record set this year could either fall to McLaughlin or be extended by its owner. The night will conclude with the men\u2019s 3000 metres steeplechase final, before the men\u2019s 400 metres final takes centre stage. Fred Kerley of the United States will be the favourite after his brilliant 43.64 this year. Steven Gardiner and Kirani James will hope to have something to stay about that.",

On the economy, the government is desperately hoping we\u2019ve reached what the Reserve Bank governor, Philip Lowe, <a href=\"https://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2019/sp-gov-2019-10-01.html\">called a \u201cgentle turning point\u201d this week</a>.

The government is gambling that tax cuts and record low interest rates will supply the necessary voltage to the economy, so there\u2019s no need to flap around with a rolling seminar about whether their strategy is the correct one.</p> <p>Maybe that call is the correct one. If it isn\u2019t, I shudder, because Australians will be the losers.</p> <p>But as high stakes as that particular gamble is, I don\u2019t want to get bogged down in the economy. Foreign policy needs to be our focus this weekend because it\u2019s now time to conduct a stocktake of what Morrison is saying in order to determine whether or not any of it means anything.</p> <p>Let\u2019s start with the tangible. The Coalition\u2019s decision to slash the aid budget after coming to power in 2013 delivered a rising opportunity for China to launch a soft power offensive right on Australia\u2019s doorstop. It was a desperately stupid decision by Tony Abbott and his colleagues and it required a subsequent course correction in the Pacific. Malcolm Turnbull started the Pacific pivot and Morrison has accelerated the necessary course correction with the so-called Pacific step-up.</p> <p>So we have a front-foot policy in the Pacific now. Australia is back in the region, and tangibly so, activity which is demonstrably in our interests, although Morrison\u2019s obduracy on climate change undermines our standing with Pacific leaders and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/16/fiji-pm-frank-bainimarama-insulting-scott-morrison-rift-pacific-countries\">creates a friction point</a> that wouldn\u2019t be there if the Coalition didn\u2019t have a psychotic break any time the words emission reduction were uttered consecutively in a sentence.</p> <p>Having noted the Pacific, we can track to China, and the United States and the prime ministerial scene setting of the past couple of weeks \u2013 Morrison\u2019s speech last week to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/24/australian-pm-says-china-must-step-up-on-climate-change-as-newly-developed-nation\">the Chicago Institute for Global Affairs</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/03/scott-morrison-echoes-trump-as-he-warns-nations-must-avoid-negative-globalism\">the Lowy Institute on Thursday night</a>.</p> <p>If we strip away the rhetoric, and boil it down to core objectives, the Morrison mantra looks like this: close to America, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/29/morrison-leaning-into-trump-might-have-a-strange-logic-but-its-risky\">even though that means close to Trump</a>; strategic needling of China without blowing our most important economic relationship completely off the map; and inserting Australia more forcefully into the conversation about reshaping the global economic order that is thundering already courtesy of Trump and Xi\u2019s trade war, and because of the general ennui with the multilateral trading system and the constant battle to maintain a global agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, where the world needs China and America to do more.</p> <p>Morrison is running head-first at foreign policy because it\u2019s intrinsically interesting, and important for a middle power like Australia. But what also needs to be foregrounded is he\u2019s hunting for ways to make his foreign policy rhetoric resonate in domestic politics.</p> <p>It\u2019s quite interesting to me that the prime minister avoided the made-for-Fox News nativist tub-thumping that Trump engages in 24/7 while he was in the US but, on his return back to Australia, turned on that tap modestly at the Lowy Institute.</p> <p>Criticising \u201cunaccountable internationalist bureaucracy\u201d and disdaining \u201cnegative globalism\u201d (Morrison\u2019s formulations in the Lowy speech) works for Trump with disaffected voters, which is why the president went last week to the headquarters of globalism, the United Nations, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/24/donald-trump-un-address-denounces-globalism\">and declared the future belonged to patriots</a>.

Morrison says he wants China to be considered a newly developed economy, not a developing one. What he means is he wants China to have more normalised trade relationships with the rest of the world and cut emissions faster. That\u2019s the crux of it, and as a point of principle there\u2019s nothing wrong with either of those ideas.</p> <p>But when you ask the prime minister for a fact, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/24/scott-morrison-ducks-questions-on-australias-emissions-strategy-for-2050\">as I did in Chicago</a> \u2013 whether this redefinition means Australia no longer accepts the established framework of common but differentiated responsibilities (a principle within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change<strong> </strong>which in simple terms means the developed world does more than the developing world) \u2013 he will not give a straight answer.</p> <p>You don\u2019t get detail, you get an indirect hint. \u201cIf the goal is to reduce emissions then we have obviously got to focus on the places which have the largest emissions, that just seems like common sense to me,\u201d Morrison said.</p> <p>Also clear as mud: if Australia now wants China to be considered part of the club of developed nations, are we prepared to accept the flip side of that redefinition?</p> <p>Will China be given more influence in the World Bank or be welcomed into the OECD \u2013 or is this \u201cpull on your big boys pants, Beijing\u201d pitch just a fresh attempt by the west to define the terms of China\u2019s 21st century rise, and constrain that rise where possible?

To go with the NSW Blues inscription on the State of Origin shield, Tedesco has collected awards named after Wally Lewis, Brad Fittler and Dally Messenger. He is favourite to wear the medal honouring Clive Churchill for best player afield in a grand final, and to slip on another chunky premier\u2019s ring.</p> <p>And as the Roosters seek to be the first club to win back-to-back premierships since Brisbane Broncos last century, their brilliant No 1 is in rare and dare one suggest it, Churchill-esque form. A medal with the Immortal\u2019s name would cap the greatest one-man winning season ever.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/03/james-tedesco-on-verge-of-rugby-league-grand-slam-after-dally-m-win\">James Tedesco on verge of rugby league grand slam after Dally M win</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet the Raiders may have an answer: target Tedesco. They won\u2019t \u201cbash\u201d him \u2013 you can\u2019t \u201cbash\u201d people on the rugby league field today; you could be arrested \u2013&#xa0;but you can work a player over: bruise the ribs, jolt the hips. The best players cannot be stopped, but you can try to wear them out though repeated high-physicality.</p> <p>The Raiders\u2019 work on Tedesco on Sunday night will be super-physical. They won\u2019t employ illegality like that which Terry Lamb dished out upon Ellery Hanley in 1988 or Mal Meninga and his mighty forearm guard that so rattled Lamb in 1994. Television sees all and time in the sin bin is to be avoided at all costs. Yet Canberra can try to \u201cruffle\u201d Tedesco, bruise him and tire him out.</p> <p>The problem is, Tedesco\u2019s activities can be lethal. The Raiders tried the same with success upon Melbourne Storm fullback Ryan Papenhuyzen in the qualifying final at AAMI Park.

      "bodyText": "Sydney Roosters fullback James Tedesco has won it all in 2019 and there is much to suggest that heading into Sunday\u2019s NRL grand final he\u2019ll be adding a couple more gongs to his already heaving mantle. To go with the NSW Blues inscription on the State of Origin shield, Tedesco has collected awards named after Wally Lewis, Brad Fittler and Dally Messenger. He is favourite to wear the medal honouring Clive Churchill for best player afield in a grand final, and to slip on another chunky premier\u2019s ring. And as the Roosters seek to be the first club to win back-to-back premierships since Brisbane Broncos last century, their brilliant No 1 is in rare and dare one suggest it, Churchill-esque form. A medal with the Immortal\u2019s name would cap the greatest one-man winning season ever. Yet the Raiders may have an answer: target Tedesco. They won\u2019t \u201cbash\u201d him \u2013 you can\u2019t \u201cbash\u201d people on the rugby league field today; you could be arrested \u2013 but you can work a player over: bruise the ribs, jolt the hips. The best players cannot be stopped, but you can try to wear them out though repeated high-physicality. The Raiders\u2019 work on Tedesco on Sunday night will be super-physical. They won\u2019t employ illegality like that which Terry Lamb dished out upon Ellery Hanley in 1988 or Mal Meninga and his mighty forearm guard that so rattled Lamb in 1994. Television sees all and time in the sin bin is to be avoided at all costs. Yet Canberra can try to \u201cruffle\u201d Tedesco, bruise him and tire him out. The problem is, Tedesco\u2019s activities can be lethal. The Raiders tried the same with success upon Melbourne Storm fullback Ryan Papenhuyzen in the qualifying final at AAMI Park. Canberra bunted bombs at the lightweight flier and sent hordes of Vikings through to rough him up the best they could. They scrapped and niggled, poked and prodded, dragged him in goal. Statistics tell us that Papenhuyzen ran for a game-high 184 metres yet a couple of long-range efforts made up that number. His team\u2019s scoring was limited to three goals by Cameron Smith and a try in the 42nd minute to Suliasi Vunivalu.

On 15 October, the ABS will test the census on 40,000 households in Wagga Wagga and south of Brisbane, including proposed new questions on non-binary sex, long-term health conditions and Australian defence force service. The test follows a consultation process in 2018 that identified eight potential new topics. The ABS has decided not to proceed with questions on gender identity, sexual orientation, respondents\u2019 journey to education and smoking. The Equality Australia chief executive, Anna Brown, told Guardian Australia: \u201cIt is disappointing that the ABS will not be collecting information about sexual orientation in the next census. \u201cIt is absolutely vital for us to be counted if we are to have the diverse needs of the LGBTIQ community adequately addressed in government policy and programs.\u201d The LGBTI Health Network had lobbied for inclusion of sexual orientation, gender identity and intersex status to help address the significant health disparities experienced by LGBTI people. \u201cWe all know about the mental health and well-being disparities for LGBTIQ Australians,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe need a clearer understanding of the demographics of our communities so we can ensure that funding whether for healthcare, or social services, is directed to where it is most needed.\u201d An ABS spokesman attributed the decision to a desire to keep \u201cthe burden we placed on responding households to a minimum, and being able to test our processes\u201d.

      "body": "<p> In the first chapter of Yang Hengjun\u2019s breathless first spy novel, Fatal Weakness, his protagonist, Yang Wenfeng, is hauled in by police for questioning.</p> <p>The officers are cliched in their zealotry: \u201cYou\u2019ve spent time in America; they say people there only tell the truth when talking to their priests and their psychologists, but lie when talking to police, if they talk at all.

The Australian government says outright he is not an agent of Canberra, and the Chinese government, too, denies having ever employed him.</p> <p>More likely, sources say, in the eyes of Beijing, Yang\u2019s reformist pro-democracy writing, his<em> jie di qi</em> style \u2013 a colloquialism that literally means \u201cconnecting with the earth\u2019s energy\u201d but might best be translated as relatability or the \u201ccommon touch\u201d \u2013 and his influence with significant swathes of the Chinese population, gave him a latent power to agitate for reform. </p> <p>Yang, whose legal name is Yang Jun, was born in Hubei, central China, in 1965, to a poor family reportedly unremarkable in its orthodoxy. In his grandparents\u2019 era, his family had been one of significant local standing, sources say, but it had fallen a little in recent generations. His father was a school teacher, his mother a nurse. Both are now deceased.</p> <p>Yang was unmistakably bright and hard-working at school. He won a place at Shanghai\u2019s Fudan University, where he studied political economy.</p> <p>After graduating, he won a position at the highly competitive Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1987. Inside China\u2019s sprawling, arcane and strictly hierarchical bureaucracy, Yang seemed to progress well: his work took him across the country and overseas, with steady, if unspectacular, progress and promotion. After two years in Beijing, Yang was posted as section chief of the foreign affairs office of the Hainan provincial government in the South China Sea.</p> <p>But there are elements of his biography that are imprecise. According to several sources, at this time Yang developed links to the Ministry of State Security, but the nature of those are unclear. A picture taken at the time \u2013 speculated to be in 1988 - shows him in the uniform of the MSS, but the Chinese government flatly denies all links.</p> <p>From 1992 to 1997, Yang worked in Hong Kong, as a department manager in a state-run travel bureau, before, in 1997, taking a post as a senior fellow with US thinktank the Atlantic Council in Washington DC.</p> <p>Yang moved to Australia in 1999.</p> <p>Intent on writing a doctoral thesis on the emergence of the blogosphere in China in conflict with government control and censorship, he sought out Dr Feng Chongyi, associate professor in China studies at the University of Technology, Sydney. Feng was a well-known and outspoken critic of the Chinese one-party state, who was himself later <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/mar/27/chongyi-feng-australian-academic-banned-from-leaving-china-told-not-to-talk\">detained by the Chinese government</a>. </p> <p>Feng says neither Yang\u2019s personality nor his ideology are easily typecast.</p> <p>\u201cYou need to differentiate the two parts of Yang Hengjun, one is the orthodox communist bureaucrat, one is the liberal democrat. You need to make the distinction, whether this is his previous life, or his current political opinion.</p> <p>\u201cBut the transition from one to the other was a slow process. He worked in the government from 1987 to 1999. That was 12 years, working as a bureaucrat within the system. During that time, he began as loyal but he grew to hate the corruption, to hate the abuses of the one-party state system.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He began as loyal but he grew to hate the corruption, to hate the abuses of the one-party state system.</p> <footer> <cite>Feng Chongyi</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Beyond a frustration with the strictures and contradictions of one-party rule, Yang appeared to feel constrained by his role as a public functionary: a limited autonomy subsumed to a precisely dictated greater good.</p> <p>\u201cHe watched a lot of Hollywood movies,\u201d Feng says. \u201cIn those American films, the secret agents, they are patriotic figures, but they stand on their own, they work in defiance of the bureaucracy and the establishment, they are individualistic. This was Yang\u2019s model, the individualistic hero.\u201d</p> <h2>The push for reform<br></h2> <p>Fatal Weakness held to type: its protagonist, Yang Wen Feng, is a Fudan University graduate recruited to work in China\u2019s Ministry of State Security, who eventually becomes a double agent with opaque loyalties in a series of Sino-US spy wars. Through chapters titled \u201cInfiltrating the FBI\u201d, \u201cCIA Spy School\u201d and \u201cChinese Spies in America\u201d, the story follows the exploits of Yang and his former classmates working in China\u2019s national security agencies, enduring wrongful convictions for crimes against the state, and uncovering US plots to infiltrate China\u2019s intelligence operations.</p> <p>Yang had designs on fame as a writer. Fatal Weakness was quickly followed by Fatal Weapon and<em> </em>Fatal Assassination, a kind of Chinese Jason Bourne series, using fiction to explore the arcane operations behind China\u2019s Ministry of State Security.</p> <p>In a 2017 blog post, Yang said his intention was to \u201cset a precedent for the spy fiction genre in China, which remains to this day the only literary work of its kind in the country\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI also wanted to demystify the world of spies and secret intelligence, without exposing too much or touching on the political sensitivities of China, the United States, and Taiwan, using literature to inform ordinary readers about the work of intelligence agencies and the lives of intelligence agents.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"aab28e3d63a8692a1099bfd17be843d7f197c59e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aab28e3d63a8692a1099bfd17be843d7f197c59e/0_0_3000_2457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yang Hengjun pictured in an unknown location in Tibet in 2014\" width=\"1000\" height=\"819\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yang Hengjun pictured in an unknown location in Tibet in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yang imagined his spy novels would be global best-sellers but the reality was bracing. The books tend to cliche \u2013 the spies\u2019 world is dangerous yet glamorous, soaked in alcohol and sex, subterfuge and clandestine conversations. The characters are under-developed yet overwritten. The books did not sell well, and a mooted film never got off the ground.</p> <p>The experience was chastening, friends say, but Yang found his metier, and his audience, in his online political writing.</p> <p>Yang became a prolific blogger, posting often and writing conversationally, mostly in Chinese. Yang\u2019s posts range from quotidian musings about his life and travel observations, to extensive socio-political commentary on global news. He roamed across China\u2019s political landscape, penning forthright opinions on issues acutely sensitive to Beijing such as the origins and nature of Chinese nationalism, the fate of ethnic minorities in Tibet, and the leadership of Xi Jinping, amassing more than 300,000 followers on his Weibo page and nearly 130,000 on Twitter.</p> <p>\u201cI believe that democracy, freedom and the rule of law will surely come ... I think the vast majority of my readers understand my blog, can draw hope from it, and be encouraged to live optimistically, continue to pursue and look forward to [that time].\u201d</p> <p>Yang wrote widely on the weaknesses and contradictions he perceived within China\u2019s one party system, its ideological flaws and self-interested corruption. He argued that only through genuine democratic reform could China comprehensively flourish, and warned against the creeping totalitarianism of the Communist party, its desire to control all aspects of its citizens\u2019 lives and its expansionist ambitions.</p> <h2>Yang\u2019s 2011 arrest</h2> <p>In 2011 Yang was summarily arrested after being followed by three men at Guangzhou airport. He disappeared for a week \u2013 fuelling global speculation he had been detained \u2013 but re-emerged a week later with an unconvincingexplanation. He told reporters his disappearance was a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d and he had been sick, a claim he has since retracted.</p> <p>Upon his release, and as Chinese online censorship tightened around those who deviated from the communist party line, Yang took to WeChat, establishing more than 100 channels in 50 cities, with thousands of followers.</p> <p>He was, in Feng\u2019s words, \u201ca marvellous writer\u201d, who found a natural connection with the Chinese population, not only intellectuals and the well-educated, but also peasants and the country\u2019s stunted grassroots democracy movement. His followers included senior party officials, government spies and frustrated mid-tier bureaucrats caught up in the same system he had once worked under.</p> <p>\u201cHe understood the Chinese people easily and naturally,\u201d Feng says. \u201cHe shared their frustrations, and their ambitions.\u201d</p> <p>Yang assiduously cultivated an aura of mystique and influence within the arcane world of Chinese politics. He flaunted online his 2014 invitation to a banquet in Beijing marking the 65th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China, an event attended by Xi and former leaders Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao.</p> <p>He played up real and created connections to senior political leaders, including Xi, and senior scholars under whom he claimed to have studied at university such as Wang Huning, the Communist party\u2019s chief of ideology. Yang played the game to his advantage, sources say, carving out a space where he could write more freely than others.</p> <p>While others faced persecution, Yang was allowed to survive online, even thrive, leading to allegations he was an agent of Beijing\u2019s secret services.</p> <p>Chinese dissident Lebao Wu, who lives in Canberra and knew Yang in Australia, says Yang\u2019s past was difficult to disentangle and his future hard to predict.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Frankly, I really don\u2019t want to reveal whether or not I\u2019m a spy, and for which country I work</p> <footer> <cite>Yang Henjun</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cAlmost 100% I believe he was a special agent for the MSS. It\u2019s very hard for him to hide his history, there are pictures of him in the uniform of the Chinese state security police, and he talked about his past, without giving away too much, in his writing. After he resettled in Australia, I believe there are two possibilities \u2013 one, he was sent by the MSS, he was on a mission from state security authorities, or two, he defected from China to Australia. The Chinese intelligence authorities are incredibly tough on officials who have defected.\u201d</p> <p>Yang appears to have enjoyed high-level protection for a time, Wu says.</p> <p>\u201cHe went back to China many times, he was invited to important banquets, and held media events broadcast on state media. It appeared he had high-level connections, he knew people in positions of power and he was protected.

      "bodyText": "In the first chapter of Yang Hengjun\u2019s breathless first spy novel, Fatal Weakness, his protagonist, Yang Wenfeng, is hauled in by police for questioning. The officers are cliched in their zealotry: \u201cYou\u2019ve spent time in America; they say people there only tell the truth when talking to their priests and their psychologists, but lie when talking to police, if they talk at all. I have to warn you, this is China, where the people tell the police and The Party the truth.\u201d Yang, an Australian novelist and self-declared \u201cdemocracy pedlar\u201d, has spent seven months imprisoned by China\u2019s Ministry of State Security, an agency for which he once allegedly worked, after being arrested and accused of spying for a foreign state. The conviction rate for those accused of a crime in China is 99%, in a criminal justice system almost entirely reliant on \u201cconfessions\u201d obtained through long, secretive detentions. Espionage potentially carries the death penalty. As revealed by the Guardian, Yang has faced intense and protracted interrogations, his hands and feet shackled as he is repeatedly told he faces execution, that his country has abandoned him, his family and friends betrayed him. In Fatal Weakness, the interrogations continue: \u201cI let my head drop, and for the next week there are interrogations every day \u2026 I can\u2019t keep telling them who I think I am, I have to answer each question considering who they think I really am.\u201d \u2018The individualistic hero\u2019 Sources who have known Yang across China, Australia and the US insist he is no spy, despite his enduring fascination with a somewhat glamorised, Hollywood ideal of the world of espionage. The Australian government says outright he is not an agent of Canberra, and the Chinese government, too, denies having ever employed him. More likely, sources say, in the eyes of Beijing, Yang\u2019s reformist pro-democracy writing, his jie di qi style \u2013 a colloquialism that literally means \u201cconnecting with the earth\u2019s energy\u201d but might best be translated as relatability or the \u201ccommon touch\u201d \u2013 and his influence with significant swathes of the Chinese population, gave him a latent power to agitate for reform. Yang, whose legal name is Yang Jun, was born in Hubei, central China, in 1965, to a poor family reportedly unremarkable in its orthodoxy. In his grandparents\u2019 era, his family had been one of significant local standing, sources say, but it had fallen a little in recent generations. His father was a school teacher, his mother a nurse. Both are now deceased. Yang was unmistakably bright and hard-working at school. He won a place at Shanghai\u2019s Fudan University, where he studied political economy. After graduating, he won a position at the highly competitive Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1987. Inside China\u2019s sprawling, arcane and strictly hierarchical bureaucracy, Yang seemed to progress well: his work took him across the country and overseas, with steady, if unspectacular, progress and promotion. After two years in Beijing, Yang was posted as section chief of the foreign affairs office of the Hainan provincial government in the South China Sea. But there are elements of his biography that are imprecise. According to several sources, at this time Yang developed links to the Ministry of State Security, but the nature of those are unclear. A picture taken at the time \u2013 speculated to be in 1988 - shows him in the uniform of the MSS, but the Chinese government flatly denies all links. From 1992 to 1997, Yang worked in Hong Kong, as a department manager in a state-run travel bureau, before, in 1997, taking a post as a senior fellow with US thinktank the Atlantic Council in Washington DC. Yang moved to Australia in 1999. Intent on writing a doctoral thesis on the emergence of the blogosphere in China in conflict with government control and censorship, he sought out Dr Feng Chongyi, associate professor in China studies at the University of Technology, Sydney. Feng was a well-known and outspoken critic of the Chinese one-party state, who was himself later detained by the Chinese government. Feng says neither Yang\u2019s personality nor his ideology are easily typecast. \u201cYou need to differentiate the two parts of Yang Hengjun, one is the orthodox communist bureaucrat, one is the liberal democrat. You need to make the distinction, whether this is his previous life, or his current political opinion. \u201cBut the transition from one to the other was a slow process. He worked in the government from 1987 to 1999. That was 12 years, working as a bureaucrat within the system. During that time, he began as loyal but he grew to hate the corruption, to hate the abuses of the one-party state system.\u201d Beyond a frustration with the strictures and contradictions of one-party rule, Yang appeared to feel constrained by his role as a public functionary: a limited autonomy subsumed to a precisely dictated greater good. \u201cHe watched a lot of Hollywood movies,\u201d Feng says. \u201cIn those American films, the secret agents, they are patriotic figures, but they stand on their own, they work in defiance of the bureaucracy and the establishment, they are individualistic. This was Yang\u2019s model, the individualistic hero.\u201d The push for reform Fatal Weakness held to type: its protagonist, Yang Wen Feng, is a Fudan University graduate recruited to work in China\u2019s Ministry of State Security, who eventually becomes a double agent with opaque loyalties in a series of Sino-US spy wars. Through chapters titled \u201cInfiltrating the FBI\u201d, \u201cCIA Spy School\u201d and \u201cChinese Spies in America\u201d, the story follows the exploits of Yang and his former classmates working in China\u2019s national security agencies, enduring wrongful convictions for crimes against the state, and uncovering US plots to infiltrate China\u2019s intelligence operations. Yang had designs on fame as a writer. Fatal Weakness was quickly followed by Fatal Weapon and Fatal Assassination, a kind of Chinese Jason Bourne series, using fiction to explore the arcane operations behind China\u2019s Ministry of State Security. In a 2017 blog post, Yang said his intention was to \u201cset a precedent for the spy fiction genre in China, which remains to this day the only literary work of its kind in the country\u201d. \u201cI also wanted to demystify the world of spies and secret intelligence, without exposing too much or touching on the political sensitivities of China, the United States, and Taiwan, using literature to inform ordinary readers about the work of intelligence agencies and the lives of intelligence agents.\u201d Yang imagined his spy novels would be global best-sellers but the reality was bracing. The books tend to cliche \u2013 the spies\u2019 world is dangerous yet glamorous, soaked in alcohol and sex, subterfuge and clandestine conversations. The characters are under-developed yet overwritten. The books did not sell well, and a mooted film never got off the ground. The experience was chastening, friends say, but Yang found his metier, and his audience, in his online political writing. Yang became a prolific blogger, posting often and writing conversationally, mostly in Chinese. Yang\u2019s posts range from quotidian musings about his life and travel observations, to extensive socio-political commentary on global news. He roamed across China\u2019s political landscape, penning forthright opinions on issues acutely sensitive to Beijing such as the origins and nature of Chinese nationalism, the fate of ethnic minorities in Tibet, and the leadership of Xi Jinping, amassing more than 300,000 followers on his Weibo page and nearly 130,000 on Twitter. \u201cI believe that democracy, freedom and the rule of law will surely come ... I think the vast majority of my readers understand my blog, can draw hope from it, and be encouraged to live optimistically, continue to pursue and look forward to [that time].\u201d Yang wrote widely on the weaknesses and contradictions he perceived within China\u2019s one party system, its ideological flaws and self-interested corruption. He argued that only through genuine democratic reform could China comprehensively flourish, and warned against the creeping totalitarianism of the Communist party, its desire to control all aspects of its citizens\u2019 lives and its expansionist ambitions. Yang\u2019s 2011 arrest In 2011 Yang was summarily arrested after being followed by three men at Guangzhou airport. He disappeared for a week \u2013 fuelling global speculation he had been detained \u2013 but re-emerged a week later with an unconvincingexplanation. He told reporters his disappearance was a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d and he had been sick, a claim he has since retracted. Upon his release, and as Chinese online censorship tightened around those who deviated from the communist party line, Yang took to WeChat, establishing more than 100 channels in 50 cities, with thousands of followers. He was, in Feng\u2019s words, \u201ca marvellous writer\u201d, who found a natural connection with the Chinese population, not only intellectuals and the well-educated, but also peasants and the country\u2019s stunted grassroots democracy movement. His followers included senior party officials, government spies and frustrated mid-tier bureaucrats caught up in the same system he had once worked under. \u201cHe understood the Chinese people easily and naturally,\u201d Feng says. \u201cHe shared their frustrations, and their ambitions.\u201d Yang assiduously cultivated an aura of mystique and influence within the arcane world of Chinese politics. He flaunted online his 2014 invitation to a banquet in Beijing marking the 65th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China, an event attended by Xi and former leaders Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao. He played up real and created connections to senior political leaders, including Xi, and senior scholars under whom he claimed to have studied at university such as Wang Huning, the Communist party\u2019s chief of ideology. Yang played the game to his advantage, sources say, carving out a space where he could write more freely than others. While others faced persecution, Yang was allowed to survive online, even thrive, leading to allegations he was an agent of Beijing\u2019s secret services. Chinese dissident Lebao Wu, who lives in Canberra and knew Yang in Australia, says Yang\u2019s past was difficult to disentangle and his future hard to predict. \u201cAlmost 100% I believe he was a special agent for the MSS. It\u2019s very hard for him to hide his history, there are pictures of him in the uniform of the Chinese state security police, and he talked about his past, without giving away too much, in his writing. After he resettled in Australia, I believe there are two possibilities \u2013 one, he was sent by the MSS, he was on a mission from state security authorities, or two, he defected from China to Australia. The Chinese intelligence authorities are incredibly tough on officials who have defected.\u201d Yang appears to have enjoyed high-level protection for a time, Wu says. \u201cHe went back to China many times, he was invited to important banquets, and held media events broadcast on state media. It appeared he had high-level connections, he knew people in positions of power and he was protected. But now, now it is very hard to know what his future will be.\u201d Yang addressed the allegations of espionage in an expansive post online, skating at the edges of a denial, but still clearly infatuated with the real or imagined world of spycraft. In A Letter to Those Looking to Catch a Spy he argued: \u201cI myself have become the target of the \u2018spycatcher games\u2019, every month I face a fresh round of allegations of being a spy, it seems many readers would like to see me star in my own erotic thriller. \u201cThe purpose of this post is not to defend myself. Frankly, I really don\u2019t want to reveal whether or not I\u2019m a spy, and for which country I work, there\u2019s nothing wrong with maintaining an air of mystery, especially to those who are already oblivious. My intention is to impart some logic and common sense onto those who spend their days trying to catch spies.\u201d The return to China The cultivated air of flamboyant disregard masked Yang\u2019s very real concern for his own safety. Sources say he was regarded by China\u2019s security agencies as one of a very few democratic activists who had the following and influence to organise social protest on a national scale. Other activists who were arrested said they were inspired by Yang, or admitted they had been reading his posts. Yang\u2019s influence overseas was also seen as intensely problematic. When you step into that area, you can expect confrontation with the party-state: \u201cYang knew this,\u201d Feng says. Yang also broadened his online presence, perhaps out of economic imperative, moving away from political commentary and pouring more energy into an online \u201cdaigou\u201d business he had established in America, essentially acting as a personal online shopper for customers seeking goods not available inside China. Yang\u2019s online store sold US-made luxury handbags, vitamins, baby formula and watches. But still he wrote, penning pieces on reform of the Chinese political system in the final days before he was arrested, arguing that a country where thoughts and speech are suppressed could never be technologically innovative or economically free.

But there has been a perception in the sector that this form of \u201cawareness-raising\u201d has been superficial.</p> <p>As Dr Juliet Watson, a family violence researcher with RMIT University has pointed out, \u201cit\u2019s advantageous for men to align themselves with feminist causes\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThey receive increased speaking opportunities, exposure, financial opportunities and brand power,\u201d Watson, a senior lecturer the university\u2019s school of global, urban and social studies, said.</p> <p>\u201cBut in the wake of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/metoo-movement\">#MeToo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/18/sisters-this-is-our-moment-to-say-times-up\">#TimesUp</a>, we are becoming more critical of those putting themselves up to be aligned with these organisations. As we should be. It\u2019s not that controversial for men to stand up and say, \u2018we don\u2019t support family violence\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s setting a pretty low bar for which they reap the benefit of male feminist capital. In other words, they gain a lot for not doing very much. We need to see evidence that ambassadors are putting in the hard work of education for themselves and others.\u201d</p> <p>White Ribbon Australia seemed to lack a rigorous process around who qualified as an ambassador. The charity was forced to distance itself from one of its ambassadors, the controversial psychiatrist Tanveer Ahmed, after he wrote an opinion piece published by News Ltd suggesting men\u2019s violence against women could be attributed to the historic decline of men\u2019s power.</p> <p>Other ambassadors, including police commissioners, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/nov/27/police-refused-to-charge-man-after-he-splashed-petrol-on-his-partner\">have refused to weigh in on high-profile cases</a> of domestic and sexual violence.</p> <h2>Questionable values</h2> <p>In 2017, the Sydney Morning Herald<em> </em>revealed the organisation was planning to accept money <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/the-system-that-makes-charities-essential-to-a-pubs-poker-machine-profit-20171124-gzsnyd.html\">from a publican if he was granted permission to install more poker machines in his venue</a>. In 2018, <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/ginarushton/white-ribbon-australia-reproductive-rights-abortion\">Buzzfeed revealed</a> that the then White Ribbon chief executive, Tracy McLeod Howe, removed the organisation\u2019s support for reproductive rights, saying it was \u201cagnostic\u201d on the issue \u2013 a move to appease stakeholders.</p> <p>The timing of the decision was particularly poor, coming the day after Queensland decriminalised abortion. According to the Australian Institute of Family Studies, women are at an increased risk of experiencing violence from an intimate partner during pregnancy.</p> <p>Although White Ribbon Australia backtracked and reinstated its support for women\u2019s right to choose, the damage had been done. For an organisation that relied on corporate sponsorship, it was losing supporters in droves.</p> <p>Family planning and women\u2019s rights organisation Marie Stopes Australia severed its ties with White Ribbon following the incident. Marie Stopes Australia\u2019s managing director, Jamal Hakim, said the charity had responded to its membership rather than \u201crespecting women\u2019s autonomy and agency\u201d and, as a result, he declined to become a White Ribbon ambassador.</p> <p>The organisation also withdrew itself from the charity\u2019s workplace accreditation program, which asks employers and employees to commit to stopping violence against women and implement standards to create a safer and more respectful workplace.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/04/welcome-to-the-mens-rights-activists-seething-divorced-resentful-fathers-support-group\">Welcome to the Men's Rights Activists Seething Divorced Resentful Fathers Support Group | First Dog on the Moon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Hakim said although the charity\u2019s closure was not surprising, it was regrettable. More than 40 people had lost their jobs, and many of those were highly committed people who would be an asset to other family violence organisations, he said.</p> <p>\u201cFor me, I am concerned there is now a void nationally in the conversation around how we bring men on board for the prevention of violence against women, which is important,\u201d Hakim said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat White Ribbon did was create a conversation. They rallied large organisations on the issue and there is a big gap here in that organisations do find it difficult to focus on these issues.

      "bodyText": "White Ribbon Australia, the well-known charity for the prevention of violence against women, was plagued by financial issues long before it filed for liquidation on Thursday. The charity\u2019s 2018 financial statement outlined its purpose as using \u201ceducation, awareness-raising, creative campaigns, preventative programs and partnerships\u201d to \u201chighlight the positive role men play in preventing men\u2019s violence against women\u201d. Despite being propped up by government funding, White Ribbon Australia had an $840,827 deficit by the end of 2018, with liabilities of $2.5m. But amid questions around how effectively White Ribbon Australia used its money \u2013 most of its expenses went towards public relations, marketing and administration costs \u2013 the charity\u2019s biggest problem was not one of finances, but of public image. A \u2018low bar\u2019 for ambassadors The charity gained its public profile by recruiting well-known men to serve as its ambassadors, usually in the form of wearing a white ribbon and declaring support for ending violence against women. But there has been a perception in the sector that this form of \u201cawareness-raising\u201d has been superficial. As Dr Juliet Watson, a family violence researcher with RMIT University has pointed out, \u201cit\u2019s advantageous for men to align themselves with feminist causes\u201d. \u201cThey receive increased speaking opportunities, exposure, financial opportunities and brand power,\u201d Watson, a senior lecturer the university\u2019s school of global, urban and social studies, said. \u201cBut in the wake of #MeToo and #TimesUp, we are becoming more critical of those putting themselves up to be aligned with these organisations. As we should be. It\u2019s not that controversial for men to stand up and say, \u2018we don\u2019t support family violence\u2019. \u201cIt\u2019s setting a pretty low bar for which they reap the benefit of male feminist capital. In other words, they gain a lot for not doing very much. We need to see evidence that ambassadors are putting in the hard work of education for themselves and others.\u201d White Ribbon Australia seemed to lack a rigorous process around who qualified as an ambassador. The charity was forced to distance itself from one of its ambassadors, the controversial psychiatrist Tanveer Ahmed, after he wrote an opinion piece published by News Ltd suggesting men\u2019s violence against women could be attributed to the historic decline of men\u2019s power. Other ambassadors, including police commissioners, have refused to weigh in on high-profile cases of domestic and sexual violence. Questionable values In 2017, the Sydney Morning Herald revealed the organisation was planning to accept money from a publican if he was granted permission to install more poker machines in his venue. In 2018, Buzzfeed revealed that the then White Ribbon chief executive, Tracy McLeod Howe, removed the organisation\u2019s support for reproductive rights, saying it was \u201cagnostic\u201d on the issue \u2013 a move to appease stakeholders. The timing of the decision was particularly poor, coming the day after Queensland decriminalised abortion. According to the Australian Institute of Family Studies, women are at an increased risk of experiencing violence from an intimate partner during pregnancy. Although White Ribbon Australia backtracked and reinstated its support for women\u2019s right to choose, the damage had been done. For an organisation that relied on corporate sponsorship, it was losing supporters in droves. Family planning and women\u2019s rights organisation Marie Stopes Australia severed its ties with White Ribbon following the incident. Marie Stopes Australia\u2019s managing director, Jamal Hakim, said the charity had responded to its membership rather than \u201crespecting women\u2019s autonomy and agency\u201d and, as a result, he declined to become a White Ribbon ambassador. The organisation also withdrew itself from the charity\u2019s workplace accreditation program, which asks employers and employees to commit to stopping violence against women and implement standards to create a safer and more respectful workplace. But Hakim said although the charity\u2019s closure was not surprising, it was regrettable. More than 40 people had lost their jobs, and many of those were highly committed people who would be an asset to other family violence organisations, he said. \u201cFor me, I am concerned there is now a void nationally in the conversation around how we bring men on board for the prevention of violence against women, which is important,\u201d Hakim said. \u201cWhat White Ribbon did was create a conversation. They rallied large organisations on the issue and there is a big gap here in that organisations do find it difficult to focus on these issues. We really need opportunities for organisations to look at themselves and ask how they address the rivers of gender inequity by looking at their own community, their own gender pay gap, their own working arrangements and whether they are flexible and fair.\u201d Men\u2019s involvement still important Watson agrees with Hakim that men must continue to be involved in family violence prevention and call out those men with appalling attitudes and behaviour. With a spate of horrific deaths of women \u2013 including 32-year-old and pregnant Helena Broadbent and Aiia Maasarwe, an Arab-Israeli student in Melbourne \u2013 and Australia Institute of Health and Welfare data showing rates of partner violence failing to fall and hospitalisations of women increasing, getting through to men was more important than ever, Watson said. \u201cIt\u2019s not harmful to advocate to say family violence is unacceptable and anyone speaking about that is good,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there needs to be content beneath those comments. There\u2019s a greater awareness of men taking up oxygen about issues that affect women and children\u2019s lives, and there must be a question of who is actually the expert here and what role men should play here. \u201cI think women are tiring of being spoken to about things we know about already.

      "body": "<p><strong>Names: </strong>Mary Crock and Ron McCallum<br><strong>Years together: </strong>35<br><strong>Occupations: </strong>Law professors</p> <p>Ron McCallum and Mary Crock share an office in their Sydney home. The couple live together, teach together and work together. In 2017, they wrote a book about disabled refugees together. Both are law professors \u2013 Crock <a href=\"https://sydney.edu.au/law/about/our-people/academic-staff/ron-mccallum.html\">in public law and migration</a>, <a href=\"https://sydney.edu.au/law/about/our-people/academic-staff/ron-mccallum.html\">McCallum in industrial law</a> \u2013 and both are passionate about social justice. Their chairs are back to back and a portrait of McCallum, painted by Crock, hangs on the wall. But, says McCallum with a laugh: \u201cIt\u2019s easier to share a bed than an office.\u201d</p> <p>They have been together for more than 34 years. They met at a dinner party in Melbourne in 1984, when she was 25 and he was 35. McCallum, who has been blind since birth due to retrolental fibroplasia (RLF), heard her \u201cbeautiful mellow\u201d voice across the table. When he introduced himself, she said: \u201cYou are obviously an RLF child.\u201d As the daughter of Australia\u2019s first full professor of ophthalmology, Gerard Crock, she was at ease in the company of blind people. McCallum was captivated: \u201cHer voice, her breathing, her inquiring mind and her scent overwhelmed me,\u201d he writes in <a href=\"https://www.allenandunwin.com/browse/books/other-books/Born-at-the-Right-Time-Ron-McCallum-9781760875015\">his autobiography</a>.</p> <p>Crock was also drawn to McCallum. After their second meeting a few months later, she knew they would be together. \u201cI remember walking on the beach thinking, \u2018What will it be like married to a blind man?\u2019. Not \u2018Is this going to happen?\u2019 But \u2018What will it be like?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>He proposed six weeks after that second meeting. \u201cWe were sitting on the couch. I said \u2018Anyway I think you\u2019ve just got to marry me, will you marry me?\u2019. And she said, \u2018Yeah, I guess.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c036fdc09e1ba76ab215f9a944b019bd10cc5f64\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c036fdc09e1ba76ab215f9a944b019bd10cc5f64/0_131_1772_1109/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ron McCallum and Mary Crock not long after they were engaged in 1985\" width=\"1000\" height=\"626\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ron McCallum and Mary Crock not long after they were engaged in 1985.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ron McCallum</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They married and soon became parents to three children. Then in 1991, Ron was appointed professor in industrial law at the University of Sydney and the family moved from Melbourne to Sydney. Away from their wider families, in a city where they knew only five people, both working full-time with three young children, it was a challenging and stressful time.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re still standing is all I can say,\u201d Crock says. \u201cI think chaos theory came into it. The children will tell you that they are all excellent cooks. And they will tell you \u2018We learned everything we know from our nanny\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>There was little time for their relationship. Their solution was what they call \u201c48-hour holidays\u201d. McCallum explains: \u201cThat\u2019s all the time we had. [We\u2019d say] \u2018Let\u2019s go somewhere for a day\u2019. Or \u2018Let\u2019s go to a conference and sleep somewhere\u2019.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a5842bf350e66d896abe94dab06e2290d9b58a86\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5842bf350e66d896abe94dab06e2290d9b58a86/0_66_1772_2652/668.jpg\" alt=\"Ron McCallum and Mary Crock on their wedding day\" width=\"668\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ron McCallum and Mary Crock on their wedding day.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ron McCallum</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Common intellectual interests and working in the same field has its benefits. They often read and discuss each other\u2019s academic work. \u201cIt\u2019s a rare privilege to have somebody who can read everything that you write and make really good criticisms of it,\u201d Crock says.</p> <p>They don\u2019t always agree. McCallum remembers teaching a joint class on labour law and migration, and after he\u2019d made a point, Crock turned to the class and said she disagreed with everything he\u2019d said. \u201cI said \u2018Could you please give the class reasons?\u2019 And they were good reasons.\u201d While they debate academic issues, they share a similar worldview. Says Crock: \u201cThere was some sympathy between the way that we thought when we met [and] it\u2019s a world view that we very much developed together as well.\u201d</p> <p>In 1995, Crock also began lecturing at the faculty of law at the University of Sydney, working in the same building as McCallum. While it was \u201ca godsend\u201d in many ways, Crock was conscious her husband was the boss. \u201cWe\u2019ve both had to make compromises, I think at different times \u2026 At the same time, I think I\u2019ve felt over the years that I\u2019ve had to make myself invisible as Ron became more and more senior.\u201d</p> <p>McCallum\u2019s blindness has its own challenges. Crock says they made conscious decisions early on about the extent to which she helped him. \u201cWe have been careful to create boundaries so that I haven\u2019t been his full time carer.\u201d</p> <p>Their physicality is part of their connection. \u201cTouching is a very important part of a relationship,\u201d McCallum says. \u201cAnd I think it also can help when things can get a bit rocky \u2026 And I\u2019m not meaning anything erotic, but it just can help. It\u2019s almost like the oil can smooth [things] over.\u201d Although she hesitates when he raises the topic, Crock agrees: \u201cIt\u2018s actually a good point to make because Ron\u2019s dependent on me for his mobility a lot of the time [so] we do touch each other a lot more.\u201d</p> <p>McCallum is quick to stress they\u2019re far from perfect. \u201cWe do have our moments and we\u2019ve had our disputes.\u201d However, conflict has its place. \u201cShowing your children conflict and resolving conflict is as important a life lesson as you can get,\u201d Crock says. \u201cBecause it shows the children that you can still be your own person. And you can disagree with someone sometimes quite profoundly but still, at the end of the day, love them and continue the relationship.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2323e5e9512930dbf240f03f653c1a425eaf358\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2323e5e9512930dbf240f03f653c1a425eaf358/0_109_2658_1596/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ron McCallum and Mary Crock with Amanya Mushega, former secretary of East African Commuity and former Ugandan minister for education, Kampala 2013\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ron McCallum and Mary Crock with Amanya Mushega, former secretary of East African Commuity and former Ugandan minister for education, Kampala 2013</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ron McCallum</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>McCallum agrees: \u201cI think the best thing we can give our children is [the sense] that we\u2019ve had a reasonably good relationship that they\u2019ve grown up in, and they\u2019ve seen us in our underwear at one place. And they\u2019ve seen us argue, and they\u2019ve seen us in good times. And they know that we\u2019re very committed, and committed to them.\u201d</p> <p>Commitment is what keeps them together. \u201cIt\u2019s about reflecting on how your life is going to be and what you want to achieve together. Rather than just having personal goals, you end up having goals together,\u201d Crock says. \u201cAnd I think one of the important things for me is that it\u2019s a relationship that involves creativity and fun.\u201d</p> <p>And, while shared interests are important, so too are individual activities: \u201cWe have also managed to leave each other to have a bit of personal space as well. Over the years, [Ron\u2019s] pushed me to do a lot of things that have taken me out of my comfort zone. He\u2019s also pushed me to do things that he knows that I\u2019m passionate about that he can\u2019t share in.\u201d For Crock, that means painting \u2013 and she has her own space for this. \u201cI have a shed\u201d she says pointing to the garden. \u201cThat\u2019s Mary\u2019s shed out there\u201d</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.allenandunwin.com/browse/books/other-books/Born-at-the-Right-Time-Ron-McCallum-9781760875015\">Born at the Right Time</a> by Prof Ron McCallum ($29.99, Allen &amp; Unwin) is on sale now</em></p> <p><em>We want to hear your stories about staying together.

The children will tell you that they are all excellent cooks. And they will tell you \u2018We learned everything we know from our nanny\u2019.\u201d There was little time for their relationship. Their solution was what they call \u201c48-hour holidays\u201d. McCallum explains: \u201cThat\u2019s all the time we had. [We\u2019d say] \u2018Let\u2019s go somewhere for a day\u2019. Or \u2018Let\u2019s go to a conference and sleep somewhere\u2019.\u201d Common intellectual interests and working in the same field has its benefits. They often read and discuss each other\u2019s academic work. \u201cIt\u2019s a rare privilege to have somebody who can read everything that you write and make really good criticisms of it,\u201d Crock says. They don\u2019t always agree. McCallum remembers teaching a joint class on labour law and migration, and after he\u2019d made a point, Crock turned to the class and said she disagreed with everything he\u2019d said. \u201cI said \u2018Could you please give the class reasons?\u2019 And they were good reasons.\u201d While they debate academic issues, they share a similar worldview. Says Crock: \u201cThere was some sympathy between the way that we thought when we met [and] it\u2019s a world view that we very much developed together as well.\u201d In 1995, Crock also began lecturing at the faculty of law at the University of Sydney, working in the same building as McCallum. While it was \u201ca godsend\u201d in many ways, Crock was conscious her husband was the boss. \u201cWe\u2019ve both had to make compromises, I think at different times \u2026 At the same time, I think I\u2019ve felt over the years that I\u2019ve had to make myself invisible as Ron became more and more senior.\u201d McCallum\u2019s blindness has its own challenges. Crock says they made conscious decisions early on about the extent to which she helped him. \u201cWe have been careful to create boundaries so that I haven\u2019t been his full time carer.\u201d Their physicality is part of their connection. \u201cTouching is a very important part of a relationship,\u201d McCallum says. \u201cAnd I think it also can help when things can get a bit rocky \u2026 And I\u2019m not meaning anything erotic, but it just can help. It\u2019s almost like the oil can smooth [things] over.\u201d Although she hesitates when he raises the topic, Crock agrees: \u201cIt\u2018s actually a good point to make because Ron\u2019s dependent on me for his mobility a lot of the time [so] we do touch each other a lot more.\u201d McCallum is quick to stress they\u2019re far from perfect. \u201cWe do have our moments and we\u2019ve had our disputes.\u201d However, conflict has its place. \u201cShowing your children conflict and resolving conflict is as important a life lesson as you can get,\u201d Crock says. \u201cBecause it shows the children that you can still be your own person. And you can disagree with someone sometimes quite profoundly but still, at the end of the day, love them and continue the relationship.\u201d McCallum agrees: \u201cI think the best thing we can give our children is [the sense] that we\u2019ve had a reasonably good relationship that they\u2019ve grown up in, and they\u2019ve seen us in our underwear at one place. And they\u2019ve seen us argue, and they\u2019ve seen us in good times. And they know that we\u2019re very committed, and committed to them.\u201d Commitment is what keeps them together. \u201cIt\u2019s about reflecting on how your life is going to be and what you want to achieve together. Rather than just having personal goals, you end up having goals together,\u201d Crock says. \u201cAnd I think one of the important things for me is that it\u2019s a relationship that involves creativity and fun.\u201d And, while shared interests are important, so too are individual activities: \u201cWe have also managed to leave each other to have a bit of personal space as well. Over the years, [Ron\u2019s] pushed me to do a lot of things that have taken me out of my comfort zone. He\u2019s also pushed me to do things that he knows that I\u2019m passionate about that he can\u2019t share in.\u201d For Crock, that means painting \u2013 and she has her own space for this. \u201cI have a shed\u201d she says pointing to the garden. \u201cThat\u2019s Mary\u2019s shed out there\u201d Born at the Right Time by Prof Ron McCallum ($29.99, Allen &amp; Unwin) is on sale now We want to hear your stories about staying together.

      "bodyText": "A significant Australian proponent of the QAnon conspiracy theory is a family friend of Scott Morrison, and his wife is on the prime minister\u2019s staff. The sprawling, disjointed and incoherent QAnon conspiracy variously claims that Donald Trump is leading a behind-the-scenes fight against a shadowy deep state, that powerful forces are hiding and protecting satanic paedophile rings, and that a secretive individual named Q leaves clues for his followers to decipher on internet forums. The FBI has previously warned that QAnon could act as a potential motivator for \u201cdomestic extremists\u201d and last year Reddit banned one of its main QAnon threads for repeated violations of its content policy, warning it would not tolerate content \u201cthat incites violence, disseminates personal information, or harasses\u201d users. In Australia, one of the more significant QAnon figures tweets under the handle @BurnedSpy34 and has amassed 21,000 Twitter followers in just over a year. BurnedSpy tweets daily QAnon material, including bizarre theories about Alexander Downer and Julie Bishop. The Guardian has learned the identity of BurnedSpy and established he is a longstanding family friend of the Australian prime minister and his wife, Jenny. The wife of BurnedSpy works on the prime minister\u2019s staff. There is no suggestion that the families\u2019 close relationship has influenced Morrison, or that BurnedSpy poses a danger. BurnedSpy told the Guardian he had never sought to speak to the prime minister about QAnon. \u201cI have never spoken to Scott about anything of a political nature. I\u2019m not an adviser. The idea of me talking to him about this ... it\u2019s just not true,\u201d he said. But some who know BurnedSpy have become concerned about the extent of his immersion in the QAnon theory, saying it may leave him open to influence by others. The family friendship is largely driven by the closeness between BurnedSpy\u2019s wife and Jenny Morrison. The pair have been lifelong friends, and the Guardian has learned the wife was recently employed on the prime minister\u2019s staff in a publicly funded position, but not in any policy or advisory capacity. There is no evidence she shares her husband\u2019s views. BurnedSpy\u2019s tweets have frequently been cited as \u201cworld-class\u201d in QAnon research threads on 8Chan, the forum Australian telecommunications companies were encouraged to block by Morrison\u2019s government after it hosted the Christchurch terrorist attack videos. BurnedSpy\u2019s Twitter account makes repeated claims about Downer, a frequent target of QAnon. In a thread last year, he linked a 1996 child abuse inquiry in Australia to Downer\u2019s role in kickstarting the Russian interference investigation. \u201cIt\u2019s no coincidence that Downer did NOT want Trump elected,\u201d he tweeted. He greeted this week\u2019s news that Australia had offered assistance to the investigation into the Mueller probe, including Downer\u2019s involvement, by tweeting \u201cGame on!\u201d. BurnedSpy explained the tweet to the Guardian by saying: \u201cSo as for \u2018game on\u2019, for two years I\u2019ve been interested in the Australian high commissioner to the UK\u2019s involvement in what I consider as a coup against an incumbent sitting US president, I think that\u2019s a story.\u201d There is no substance to his claims that Downer\u2019s role in the Russia investigation had anything to do with child abuse, and no evidence that Downer did not want Trump elected. BurnedSpy has also questioned whether the former Australian foreign affairs minister Julie Bishop was connected to the conspiracy through her wearing of red shoes. \u201cIf you want to do your research into the US context, the red shoes are purported to be very much a paedophilia shout out,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cAnd there are some extremely odd photos of large groups of men in suits wearing red shoes, many of whom are promoting paedophilia.\u201d There is no evidence that Bishop is connected to any such conspiracy. In other posts, he questioned whether 8Chan was taken offline after the Christchurch attacks because it was the only uncensored platform that Q could use. The connections between his family and the Morrisons are long standing. His wife has known Scott and Jenny since they were children, and is a close friend. The Guardian has seen multiple photos of the trio together. She attended their wedding and frequently interacts with Jenny Morrison on Facebook. Photos also show BurnedSpy and Scott Morrison together. One source close to BurnedSpy\u2019s family, who asked not to be identified, expressed concerns about his immersion in QAnon material and warned he might be open to manipulation or influence. \u201c[His] beliefs have become more unusual and I have concerns about how easily [he] is influenced or infiltrated himself.\u201d The source said he was frequently heard making references to \u201cgreat awakening\u201d or \u201cdark to light\u201d \u2013 common refrains of QAnon \u2013 during conversation. When contacted for comment, BurnedSpy accused the Guardian of preparing a \u201chit piece\u201d on him. He said his friendship with the Morrisons was unrelated to the Twitter account. \u201cI\u2019m not going to diminish the relationship, that\u2019s not appropriate either. Yeah we\u2019re friends. That\u2019s good. People have friends.\u201d BurnedSpy and his son, also a QAnon follower, have met prominent US-based QAnon figures. The deceased US actor Isaac Kappy, a former QAnon proponent who frequently made unsubstantiated accusations of paedophilia against other Hollywood actors, met the pair when he came to Australia late last year. TMZ last year reported that Kappy was the focus of a police investigation after threatening two celebrities and accusing one of paedophilia. Also pictured at the meeting was Eliahi Priest, who has previously spoken at a rally for the True Blue Crew, a far-right Australian group. BurnedSpy told the Guardian that Priest turned up at the meeting without his knowledge. Priest was visited by the Australian federal police earlier this year after sending concerning emails to government officials. The officers asked Priest if he needed mental health support or counselling. He claimed to have passed on information to Morrison, via the individual controlling the BurnedSpy account. \u201cI was hanging out with the prime minister\u2019s best friend at his house in Sydney,\u201d Priest said. \u201c[He] was to pass this information to the prime minister, and he did.\u201d There is no evidence to substantiate Priest\u2019s claims. BurnedSpy told the Guardian he had met Priest only once \u2013 not intentionally \u2013 and had no ongoing association with him. The pair have now fallen out. \u201cHe makes out that I\u2019m part of [Morrison\u2019s] political team,\u201d he said. \u201cKnowing someone is a far cry from \u2026 you know lots of people, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that you\u2019re invited to conversations and you\u2019re allowed to offer an opinion without permission.\u201d BurnedSpy has also linked Hillsong, where Morrison has prayed, to mind control, and praised Morrison for his apology to child abuse survivors, during which the prime minister used the term \u201critual sexual abuse\u201d. The use of that term was interpreted by QAnon followers as referring to satanic ritual abuse. He described the movement as \u201cpeaceful\u201d and an alternative source of information, research and news for those who have lost faith in mainstream media. He said he had never been on the 8Chan forum and did not post there. Experts say conspiracy theories such as QAnon risk leaving their followers polarised and shut off from the outside world, making them unpredictable. Followers of the online \u201cPizzagate\u201d conspiracy attacked Washington\u2019s Comet Ping Pong restaurant in December 2016, believing internet rumours that prominent Democrats were harbouring child sex slaves there. An armed QAnon follower blocked traffic at Hoover Dam in Nevada with an armoured truck in June 2018, calling for the release of the \u201cOIG Report\u201d, an unredacted Justice Department inspector general report which QAnon believes will expose a shadowy network entrenched in the government. Australian National University associate professor Colin Klein, who has studied the varying belief systems behind conspiracy theories, said there was a risk when individuals began to believe ordinary sources of information were \u201cunreliable and part of the conspiracy\u201d. \u201cAll-encompassing conspiracy theories insulate themselves from the world, which makes it much easier to become polarised and violent,\u201d Klein said.",

Once the preserve of students and low-income households, private rentals now make up one-quarter of all Australian households. More people are renting for longer and the demographics of renters are shifting.</p> <p>As a report from the Productivity Commission released last week showed, the Dunk family are part of the fastest growing cohort of renters in Australia: couples with children.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know that we\u2019ll ever buy a home,\u201d Stephanie told Guardian Australia this week. \u201cWe originally began saving expecting we would and we went to a couple of auctions where we\u2019ve bid.

How does renting impact on the way we live our lives into full-time adulthood? And what happens when a generation of renters can\u2019t live off their home equity into retirement?</p> <p>In March, the Tenants\u2019 Union of New South Wales released a report that shed light on the way tenancy laws shape and affect renter\u2019s lives. It found renters craved security of tenure above all else, that three-quarters of renters avoided reporting problems with their properties, and that the fear of a \u201cno grounds\u201d eviction was a significant source of anxiety for many.</p> <p>\u201cThe other side of that is people reporting not so much anxiety but apathy,\u201d Leo Patterson-Ross, a senior policy adviser at the Tenants\u2019 Union said. \u201cThey\u2019ve sort of given up expecting anything better from their landlord or real estate agent, and that\u2019s largely because of the inability or unwillingness of governments to demand anything better.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a feeling the Dunks know well. Before moving to their terrace house in Balmain earlier this year to be closer to their son\u2019s school, they lived further west in Ashfield in a private rental managed by their landlord.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s this base level of anxiety in renting,\u201d Jamie says. \u201cNot wanting to call in any issues because you know the landlord would show up and poke around.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had toddlers the whole time and some of that anxiety passes from us to them.</p> <p>\u201cYou know, a common point of contention between parents and toddlers is drawing on the walls. But it adds another element to the dynamic when there\u2019s a landlord involved.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f8fbe248e31fc4de08ddc725c7ff8b240ba1779\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f8fbe248e31fc4de08ddc725c7ff8b240ba1779/0_86_1280_768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stephanie and James Dunk with Ira, 3, and Aubrey, 6.

While tenancy legislation assumes both parties \u2013 the tenant and the landlord \u2013 are equal, it fails to recognise the power imbalance in the relationship.</p> <p>\u201cBasically if the two parties can\u2019t reach an agreement on something, one party faces significantly greater harm,\u201d Patterson-Ross says. \u201cThe landlord faces losing profit until they find someone else to take the property, the tenant faces not having a roof over their head.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/31/to-buy-or-not-to-buy-the-million-dollar-housing-question-australians-keep-asking\">To buy or not to buy? The million-dollar housing question Australians keep asking</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For the Dunks, renting over buying is mostly a choice. Renting offers the flexibility to move cities if their careers require it, and they reason the rent they pay is roughly equivalent to the interest they would pay on a mortgage. They choose to save in order to replace the equity they would have in a home with capital.</p> <p>But things like no-fault evictions and the tendency to short leases means choosing to rent comes with significant disadvantages.</p> <p>While many European countries place controls around rent rises, give tenants the ability to negotiate longer leases and offer greater security of tenure, in Australia the tendency to short or periodic leases and the power to evict tenants without grounds means renters are at least implicitly disadvantaged.</p> <p>\u201cOf course the price is definitely part of why we haven\u2019t bought [but] we also want to challenge the idea of owning your own home as something that\u2019s part of your identity,\u201d Stephanie says. \u201cBut it would be great if along with the renting lifestyle we could have some stability.</p> <p>\u201cWe often try to look for long-term leases [but] long term generally means 12 months. And there\u2019s other things, too. It would be nice to be able to do things to improve the property, hang a picture, potentially paint a wall, to have those touches so you feel like it\u2019s your own space and don\u2019t always have it in the back of your mind that it isn\u2019t yours.\u201d</p>",

In other words, if you were from a wealthy family you could enter the market. If you weren\u2019t, you couldn\u2019t.\u201d It means that for more and more Australians, renting is a long-term reality. Once the preserve of students and low-income households, private rentals now make up one-quarter of all Australian households. More people are renting for longer and the demographics of renters are shifting. As a report from the Productivity Commission released last week showed, the Dunk family are part of the fastest growing cohort of renters in Australia: couples with children. \u201cI don\u2019t know that we\u2019ll ever buy a home,\u201d Stephanie told Guardian Australia this week. \u201cWe originally began saving expecting we would and we went to a couple of auctions where we\u2019ve bid. I think there is probably still a strong desire to own among our generation, but I think mostly people have given up on the dream because of how distant it is.\u201d That feeling \u2013 shared and discussed among an increasingly large proportion of Australians \u2013 raises some difficult questions. Are tenancy laws, designed at a time when renting was seen as a short-term housing solution before transition into ownership, fit for purpose? How does renting impact on the way we live our lives into full-time adulthood? And what happens when a generation of renters can\u2019t live off their home equity into retirement? In March, the Tenants\u2019 Union of New South Wales released a report that shed light on the way tenancy laws shape and affect renter\u2019s lives. It found renters craved security of tenure above all else, that three-quarters of renters avoided reporting problems with their properties, and that the fear of a \u201cno grounds\u201d eviction was a significant source of anxiety for many. \u201cThe other side of that is people reporting not so much anxiety but apathy,\u201d Leo Patterson-Ross, a senior policy adviser at the Tenants\u2019 Union said. \u201cThey\u2019ve sort of given up expecting anything better from their landlord or real estate agent, and that\u2019s largely because of the inability or unwillingness of governments to demand anything better.\u201d It\u2019s a feeling the Dunks know well. Before moving to their terrace house in Balmain earlier this year to be closer to their son\u2019s school, they lived further west in Ashfield in a private rental managed by their landlord. \u201cThere\u2019s this base level of anxiety in renting,\u201d Jamie says. \u201cNot wanting to call in any issues because you know the landlord would show up and poke around. \u201cWe\u2019ve had toddlers the whole time and some of that anxiety passes from us to them. \u201cYou know, a common point of contention between parents and toddlers is drawing on the walls. But it adds another element to the dynamic when there\u2019s a landlord involved.\u201d Patterson-Ross says part of the problem is the ways the laws are drafted. While tenancy legislation assumes both parties \u2013 the tenant and the landlord \u2013 are equal, it fails to recognise the power imbalance in the relationship. \u201cBasically if the two parties can\u2019t reach an agreement on something, one party faces significantly greater harm,\u201d Patterson-Ross says. \u201cThe landlord faces losing profit until they find someone else to take the property, the tenant faces not having a roof over their head.\u201d For the Dunks, renting over buying is mostly a choice. Renting offers the flexibility to move cities if their careers require it, and they reason the rent they pay is roughly equivalent to the interest they would pay on a mortgage. They choose to save in order to replace the equity they would have in a home with capital. But things like no-fault evictions and the tendency to short leases means choosing to rent comes with significant disadvantages. While many European countries place controls around rent rises, give tenants the ability to negotiate longer leases and offer greater security of tenure, in Australia the tendency to short or periodic leases and the power to evict tenants without grounds means renters are at least implicitly disadvantaged. \u201cOf course the price is definitely part of why we haven\u2019t bought [but] we also want to challenge the idea of owning your own home as something that\u2019s part of your identity,\u201d Stephanie says. \u201cBut it would be great if along with the renting lifestyle we could have some stability. \u201cWe often try to look for long-term leases [but] long term generally means 12 months. And there\u2019s other things, too. It would be nice to be able to do things to improve the property, hang a picture, potentially paint a wall, to have those touches so you feel like it\u2019s your own space and don\u2019t always have it in the back of your mind that it isn\u2019t yours.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>You don\u2019t need a farm or even a back yard to have a crack at growing your own food. It\u2019s amazing what you can grow in pots on a sunny windowsill or in a courtyard. While you won\u2019t be able to grow enough to ditch the supermarket, you will certainly be able to liven up your meals and your living space.</p> <p>A small container-based garden is the perfect place to start your food-growing adventure \u2013 you don\u2019t need big veggie beds and you don\u2019t really need any tools. It will help you to build your skills as a gardener without committing huge amounts of time or resources.</p> <p>A container garden will also reduce your food waste, as when you have ingredients like herbs and leafy greens on hand, you only pick what you need, rather than buying a whole bunch for a few leaves and watching the rest turn into a green sludge in your crisper drawer.</p> <h2><strong>Position</strong></h2> <p>When it comes to choosing a place to grow food, not all spots are created equal. The number one factor to take into account is the amount of direct sunlight your plants will receive. Most food plants need at least six hours of direct sunlight a day to thrive, which means that south-facing windowsill or courtyard with a view to your neighbour\u2019s high fence is out.</p> <p>The ideal spot for growing faces roughly between north and south, as this allows for plenty of gentle, year-round sun. West-facing positions can get blazing hot in summer; you can get away with exposing your plants to this intense sunlight, but you\u2019ll have to be vigilant about watering them. If you don\u2019t have a spot that gets enough sunlight, an alternative is to find (or start!) a local community garden instead.</p> <h2><strong>What you\u2019ll need</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pots or containers for your plants<br></strong>Any size that you can fit in your space will do the trick, but I\u2019d recommend they\u2019re at least 15cm deep with holes in the bottom for drainage. I also like to add a thin layer of coarse gravel to the bottom of my pots to ensure excess water can drain away freely. Larger plants like tomatoes or chillies are best planted by themselves in a bigger pot, while herbs and greens can be grown solo in smaller pots or together in larger pots.</p> <p>Just remember that space, water and nutrients are limited when growing in pots, so don\u2019t overcrowd your plants! It\u2019s also a good idea to sit the pots in a tray or saucer so that any runoff after watering is safely captured, especially if your pots are on a windowsill. You don\u2019t want dirty water trickling down the wall onto your nice carpet.</p> <p><strong>Potting mix<br></strong>When you\u2019re growing on this micro scale it\u2019s best to use a high-quality potting mix. It\u2019s important not to skimp on this one \u2013 buy the best you can find as your plants will later embody it. Using regular soil can lead to disease and pest problems, so seek out a potting mix (preferably organic) that is specifically designed for growing plants in containers. Look for one that has been enriched with compost or manures rather than slow-release chemicals.</p> <p><strong>Tools<br></strong>The great thing about growing in containers is that you really don\u2019t need any tools.

      "bodyText": "While he was under house arrest in Surrey in 1999, the former Chilean military dictator Augusto Pinochet received a fine malt from an old friend. \u201cScotch is one British institution that will never let you down,\u201d read the accompanying note from its sender: the former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher. The detail, revealed this week in the third volume of Charles Moore\u2019s biography of Baroness Thatcher, adds further colour to the close relationship between Thatcher and the man responsible for the death of more than 2,000 people and the torture of many more. Thatcher was appalled that the Labour government had allowed the arrest of Pinochet while he was in London for medical treatment, overriding his diplomatic immunity. \u201cI don\u2019t know when or how this tragedy will end,\u201d Thatcher told the 1999 Conservative party conference to warm applause, \u201cbut we will fight on for as long as it takes to see Senator Pinochet returned safely to his own country. The British people still believe in loyalty to their friends.\u201d Although they never met in power, Thatcher was impressed by the success of Chile\u2019s neoliberal economic program and Pinochet\u2019s bloody stance against communism in Latin America. Above all she felt a \u201cgreat debt for [Pinochet\u2019s] secret actions during the Falklands war\u201d, according to Moore. During the conflict, Pinochet installed a military radar in southern Chile to update British intelligence on the movements of Argentina\u2019s air force. He also provided safe passage for SAS troops following a botched reconnaissance mission on mainland Argentina. But for survivors of Chile\u2019s dictatorship, the relationship between the two leaders is still cause for anger. \u201cFor a British authority figure to publicly support the most bloody dictator in Latin America violated the memory of the thousands of Chileans who were killed, imprisoned and tortured under the dictatorship\u201d said Alicia Lira, the president of the Association for Relatives of the Executed. \u201cHer words were an offense to the Chilean people.\u201d According to Chile\u2019s truth and reconciliation commission, 2,279 people were murdered by Pinochet\u2019s military regime, and a further 27,255 were tortured between 1973 and 1990. Thanks to public pressure from figures such as Lira, whose husband was killed by the military in 1982, former members of the regime continue to stand trial. On Wednesday, Chilean courts sentenced one of Pinochet\u2019s former bodyguards, Cristi\u00e1n Labb\u00e9, to three years in prison for the 1973 torture of a political prisoner. Pinochet\u2019s taste in tipples was for years kept under wraps by US secret services. When an uncensored version of a Defense Intelligence Agency profile of the dictator was released under pressure from the National Security Archive at George Washington University, one of the details previously deemed too sensitive to release was : \u201cDrinks scotch and pisco sours; smokes cigarettes; likes parties.\u201d After the return to democracy however, Pinochet retained the support of many rightwing Chileans.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson is careering towards a fresh constitutional crisis, after insisting there will be \u201cno delay\u201d to Brexit just hours after government lawyers promised in a court in Scotland that he would obey the law and request an extension if he failed to clinch a deal within a fortnight. The prime minister tweeted that there must be \u201cnew deal or no deal \u2013 but no delay\u201d, echoing the words he used in his party conference speech in Manchester on Wednesday. The dramatic scenes in court came as Brexit negotiations all but ground to a halt after the EU rebuffed UK requests for them to intensify over the weekend. It now appears increasingly likely Johnson will fail to hit the deadline for a deal laid down in what he calls the \u201csurrender act\u201d. EU sources said there remained considerable doubt as to whether there was any basis for such discussions, given Johnson\u2019s insistence on there being a customs border on the island of Ireland. Meanwhile Julian Smith, the Northern Ireland secretary, was told by a series of senior figures in Belfast that the \u201cStormont lock\u201d envisaged in the proposal is unworkable, setting up a race against time to rework that aspect of the plan in time for the 17 October European council meeting. The European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act, drawn up by rebel MPs and passed by parliament, states that if Westminster does not agree to a Brexit deal by 19 October, the prime minister has to write to the EU seeking an extension to article 50 until 31 January. In extracts of legal papers submitted by the government to the court of session in Edinburgh, that emerged on Friday in a case brought by anti-Brexit campaigners, the government appeared to accept for the first time that it would have to make the request. The papers, which the government declined to publish in full, stated that the prime minister accepts \u201che is subject to the public law principle that he cannot frustrate its purpose or the purpose of its provisions. Thus he cannot act so as to prevent the letter requesting the specified extension in the act from being sent.\u201d Campaigners brought the legal action to force Johnson to comply with the requirements of the act, also known as the Benn Act, after a series of suggestions from Downing Street sources that Johnson believes he has found a loophole in the law that will allow him to leave the EU on 31 October regardless. The UK government refused to release copies of its submissions in this case to the media despite repeated requests by the Guardian, the BBC and other news organisations. Key excerpts of its pledge were read out instead by Aidan O\u2019Neill QC, the lawyer for the green energy millionaire Dale Vince, the SNP MP Joanna Cherry QC, and the lawyer and anti-Brexit campaigner Jolyon Maugham QC. O\u2019Neill told Lord Pentland, the judge hearing the case, that Johnson had repeatedly contradicted that position, including in the Commons on Wednesday, by insisting the UK would leave on 31 October \u201ccome what may\u201d. As a result, O\u2019Neill said, the court still needed to issue legally binding orders to force Johnson to comply with the Benn Act in an interdict, or injunction. If the prime minister refused to do so, O\u2019Neill could return to court to ask for Johnson to be fined or jailed, he added. Pentland is due to give his ruling on Monday. No 10 declined to comment. Yet senior government figures, including some cabinet ministers, continue to insist privately that while they will obey the law as narrowly interpreted, they can still avoid any delay to Brexit. An attempt to circumvent the law would almost certainly result in another bitter court battle for the government \u2013 but Johnson\u2019s allies hope he could thereby present himself as the man trying to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d in the face of obstructionist remainers. With a Brexit delay forced on him, Johnson could then fight a general election on a platform of a hard Brexit. Senior government insiders suggest that to confront the challenge from the Brexit party, the Conservatives would have to promise to strike an even tougher bargain than the one the prime minister is currently offering to Brussels. The backbench rebels who drew up the Benn bill hoped to avert a no-deal Brexit; but Johnson has angrily accused them of undermining the government\u2019s negotiating position. In Brussels on Friday, a European commission spokeswoman said: \u201cWe have completed discussions with the UK for today. We gave our initial reaction to the UK\u2019s proposals and asked many questions on the legal text. \u201cWe will meet again on Monday to give the UK another opportunity to present its proposals in detail.\u201d The spokeswoman added that the proposals did not \u201cprovide a basis for concluding an agreement\u201d. A senior EU diplomat said: \u201cIf we held talks at the weekend, it would look like these were proper negotiations. The truth is we\u2019re still a long way from that.

But Smith was told by several parties at the meeting that the proposal, backed by the DUP, to give the devolved government the final say on Brexit arrangements in the region after Brexit was a non-starter. One source with knowledge of the meeting said: \u201cThe message has gone back from all quarters in Northern Ireland from Sinn F\u00e9in to the Traditional Unionist Voice that this is unworkable and it will destabilise the institutions and the Good Friday agreement and is not plausible \u2013 and in light of that, if he is serious about getting a deal, he has to come back with something more realistic.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "How did we get here? The revelations about the Jimmy Savile scandal in 2012, and how the popular entertainer abused hundreds with the authorities ignoring concerns about him, created a shockwave. The need to tackle historical sex abuse became paramount and police became determined they would pursue claims without fear or favour, no matter how powerful the suspects were. In 2012 a man known then only as \u201cNick\u201d went to police in Wiltshire to claim he was a victim of a VIP paedophile ring with links to Westminster, rumours of which had existed for years. Wiltshire had doubts about his claims with one detective saying the claims were \u201ca little bit odd\u201d and \u201cit all sounds a bit \u2018spooks\u2019\u201d. Nick then went to a start-up website, Exaro, which published his claims. The Met police said they wanted to talk to Nick, and eventually in 2014 with the help of then Labour backbencher Tom Watson, Nick was persuaded to make a statement to detectives. His claims of abuse of children by a group of prominent people and of children being murdered led to Operation Midland. Why are the police in trouble? In December 2014 police held a press conference to appeal for witnesses and to show claims of historical child sex abuse would be pursued vigorously. They described the outlandish claims made by Nick as being credible, broadly in keeping with policy to believe victims unless evidence emerges to disprove them. But they went further to describe them as \u201ctrue\u201d. This would be a millstone round police necks and they were slow to retract it. They obtained warrants, which Sir Richard Henriques\u2019 report said was unlawful, and searched the homes of former military chief Edwin Bramall, former home secretary Leon Brittan and former Tory MP Harvey Proctor. The names became public. Soon Midland was dogged by claims it was a baseless witch-hunt, but as late as February 2016 police viewed Nick as credible. The investigation collapsed in March 2016. The then Met commissioner Lord Bernard Hogan-Howe commissioned a review by Henriques, a retired judge. It branded the claims a fantasy and untrue and said Nick should face criminal investigation for lying to police. What was published? A redacted version was published by the Met in November 2016. The main reason for omitting so much material was the criminal investigation into Nick. In June this year Nick, real name Carl Beech, was convicted of perverting the course of justice and fraud, and in an earlier trial for offences over indecent images of children. He was jailed for 18 years. That lifted any legal restrictions on the Met releasing more material from Henriques\u2019 review to the public. Furthermore, an investigation by the police watchdog concluded and decided no Met officer should face discipline or criminal charges, ending any prospect of prejudice from publishing more of Henriques\u2019 damning report. How damaging are Henriques\u2019 findings for the police? The Met are shown to have fallen for a fantasist, been slow to realise they had been duped, and subjected wholly innocent people to distress. The home secretary has used special powers to order in inspectors to check up on the Met. For Britain\u2019s largest force it is a continuing embarrassment. But claims of historical abuse are growing, and the government appointed inquiry on child sexual abuse has had nearly 20,000 people to come forward saying they were victims. Operation Midland was an excruciating and high-profile failure for the Met but others in policing say the priority has to be getting justice for those abused in the past and bringing attackers who thought they had got away with it to justice.",

      "body": "<p>Say what you like about British hypocrisy. It\u2019s still the best hypocrisy in the world. This is a robust hypocrisy, sustained by centuries-old structures and conventions. British hypocrisy speaks confidently. It wears a well-cut suit. It peers down the rims of its half-moon glasses as it gives you a cold, deathly half-handshake and looks towards the door. Above all British hypocrisy doesn\u2019t have to explain itself \u2013 and let\u2019s be absolutely clear on this point \u2013 to the likes of you.</p> <p>At which point, enter Sebastian Coe, Alberto Salazar, Mo Farah and the nauseating obfuscation of the BBC-platformed British athletics commentariat. Mainly, though, enter Coe, who as president of the IAAF operates under an unconditional duty of care to protect the reputation, legacy and probity of his sport.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/02/sebastian-coe-bbc-gabby-logan-world-championships-coverage\">Seb Coe hits out at BBC and Gabby Logan over Doha coverage</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was presumably in this capacity Coe suggested this week that athletes who had won medals under the coaching of Salazar at the Nike-sponsored training campus in Oregon should \u201cnot be tarnished\u201d by the fact Salazar himself <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/01/athletics-coach-alberto-salazar-receives-four-year-ban-for-doping-violations\" title=\"\">has now been banned from the sport</a> for a string of doping violations at the Nike-sponsored training campus in Oregon. These athletes should not be tarnished because none of them have actually failed a drugs test.</p> <p>It is the kind of statement you find yourself staring at, trying to find its edges. It is easy to see why Coe might be confused. We have a murder, but no body. A doping has happened. And yet no athlete has been doped. The obvious conclusion is that Salazar must be a very <em>inaccurate</em><em> </em>doper.</p> <p>There are of course cynics out there who will suggest there is something odd about a then-Nike-employed IAAF president (38 years, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/26/sebastian-coe-iaaf-nike\" title=\"\">resigned in 2015</a>) offering his disinterested thoughts on the doping violations of a Nike-funded coach at a Nike-run campus. That what Coe is really saying is that the achievements and future prospects of Sebastian Coe should not be \u201ctarnished\u201d by a scandal that is, you suspect, only now kicking into gear.</p> <p>But it can\u2019t be just that. British hypocrisy is a powerful, resilient substance. But it\u2019s not that good.</p> <p>Or is it? Consider Neil Black, UK Athletics\u2019 performance director, who announced in August 2017 that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/aug/03/mo-farah-alberto-salazar-uk-athletics-unconcerned-london-2017\" title=\"\">he had confronted Salazar</a> like a man stalking a cougar in the wild, had looked him in the eye and from that one look knew instantly there was nothing awry and that Salazar would definitely not end up being banned for doping violations. Black will clearly have to resign. If only out of embarrassment.</p> <p>Or will he? Consider for a moment the celebrity cheerleaders of the BBC punditry studios. \u201cEverybody knew that there was cheating going on and people getting away with it. It was seriously affecting the credibility of the sport.\u201d The uncompromising words, there, of Paula Radcliffe. But not this week. That was Paula Radcliffe, zero-tolerance author of Paula: My Story So Far, in a chapter called \u201cTaking on the cheats\u201d.</p> <p>That version of Radcliffe, a kind of anti-doping Che Guevara, has apparently been decommissioned. It has been replaced by the version that appeared this week on the BBC to offer up an interview of vomit-inducing faux piety during which she saw, in Salazar, a coach who was guilty of no more than \u201coverstepping the line\u201d, of wanting to win \u2013 sigh \u2013 too much, whose doping violations were, you know, kind of OK.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Farah has been a brilliant champion. He remains the face of British Athletics, and of Coe's greatest triumph</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cHave real anti-doping rules been transgressed by athletes? I don\u2019t think so.

      "bodyText": "Say what you like about British hypocrisy. It\u2019s still the best hypocrisy in the world. This is a robust hypocrisy, sustained by centuries-old structures and conventions. British hypocrisy speaks confidently. It wears a well-cut suit. It peers down the rims of its half-moon glasses as it gives you a cold, deathly half-handshake and looks towards the door. Above all British hypocrisy doesn\u2019t have to explain itself \u2013 and let\u2019s be absolutely clear on this point \u2013 to the likes of you. At which point, enter Sebastian Coe, Alberto Salazar, Mo Farah and the nauseating obfuscation of the BBC-platformed British athletics commentariat. Mainly, though, enter Coe, who as president of the IAAF operates under an unconditional duty of care to protect the reputation, legacy and probity of his sport. It was presumably in this capacity Coe suggested this week that athletes who had won medals under the coaching of Salazar at the Nike-sponsored training campus in Oregon should \u201cnot be tarnished\u201d by the fact Salazar himself has now been banned from the sport for a string of doping violations at the Nike-sponsored training campus in Oregon. These athletes should not be tarnished because none of them have actually failed a drugs test. It is the kind of statement you find yourself staring at, trying to find its edges. It is easy to see why Coe might be confused. We have a murder, but no body. A doping has happened. And yet no athlete has been doped. The obvious conclusion is that Salazar must be a very inaccurate doper. There are of course cynics out there who will suggest there is something odd about a then-Nike-employed IAAF president (38 years, resigned in 2015) offering his disinterested thoughts on the doping violations of a Nike-funded coach at a Nike-run campus. That what Coe is really saying is that the achievements and future prospects of Sebastian Coe should not be \u201ctarnished\u201d by a scandal that is, you suspect, only now kicking into gear. But it can\u2019t be just that. British hypocrisy is a powerful, resilient substance. But it\u2019s not that good. Or is it? Consider Neil Black, UK Athletics\u2019 performance director, who announced in August 2017 that he had confronted Salazar like a man stalking a cougar in the wild, had looked him in the eye and from that one look knew instantly there was nothing awry and that Salazar would definitely not end up being banned for doping violations. Black will clearly have to resign. If only out of embarrassment. Or will he? Consider for a moment the celebrity cheerleaders of the BBC punditry studios. \u201cEverybody knew that there was cheating going on and people getting away with it. It was seriously affecting the credibility of the sport.\u201d The uncompromising words, there, of Paula Radcliffe. But not this week. That was Paula Radcliffe, zero-tolerance author of Paula: My Story So Far, in a chapter called \u201cTaking on the cheats\u201d. That version of Radcliffe, a kind of anti-doping Che Guevara, has apparently been decommissioned. It has been replaced by the version that appeared this week on the BBC to offer up an interview of vomit-inducing faux piety during which she saw, in Salazar, a coach who was guilty of no more than \u201coverstepping the line\u201d, of wanting to win \u2013 sigh \u2013 too much, whose doping violations were, you know, kind of OK. \u201cHave real anti-doping rules been transgressed by athletes? I don\u2019t think so. Otherwise we would have seen athletes banned at this point,\u201d Radcliffe announced, the same Radcliffe who wrote in her own book that \u201cEverybody knows the tests are not guaranteed to expose the cheats.\u201d Which one is it! This is confusing! Instead Radcliffe, fearless crusader for the truth, suggested it had been a waste of money to expose the doping violations of the sport\u2019s most high-profile coach. A bit later she pulled an improvised foil helmet out of her holdall and implied the entire investigation was designed to distract from the recent Christian Coleman case, despite predating it by four years, a suggestion so asinine it is probably an affront to the word \u201casinine\u201d to align the two. The one thing Radcliffe didn\u2019t offer up during this stream of thought-blurts was the fact that she is herself an ambassador for Nike.

      "bodyText": "The Metropolitan police commissioner, Cressida Dick, has been urged to consider her position after a damning report laid bare a series of failings in the force\u2019s disastrous multimillion-pound investigation into an alleged VIP paedophile ring. The scathing report, which piles pressure on Britain\u2019s biggest police force, reveals that senior officers agreed to publicly say they believed accuser Carl Beech \u2013 leading a detective to infamously declare at the outset of the inquiry that his claims were \u201ccredible and true\u201d. The disclosure was omitted three years ago when the Met released a heavily redacted version of retired high court judge Sir Richard Henriques\u2019 report on its handling of the \u00a32.5m Operation Midland, which ended without a single arrest. Beech, known anonymously as \u201cNick\u201d when he made claims in 2014 that sparked the inquiry, was jailed for 18 years in July after being found guilty of making up that he was a victim of a murderous abuse ring. The unredacted report also sheds light on the extent of the role of Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, who Henriques said pressured officers investigating the allegations. In response, Watson claimed the report contains \u201cmultiple inaccuracies\u201d about his role. The 391-page report, which has sparked criticism that Scotland Yard is guilty of \u201cinstitutional stupidity\u201d, reveals: Warrants to search the homes of wrongly accused suspects were obtained \u201cunlawfully\u201d and \u201cshould not have taken place\u201d. Police \u201cmisled\u201d the magistrate who authorised the search by describing Beech\u2019s allegations as \u201cconsistent\u201d and \u201ccredible\u201d. The premeditated decision by officers to publicly say they believed Beech was a \u201cserious mistake\u201d. \u201cI cannot conceive that any fully informed officer could reasonably have believed \u2018Nick\u2019,\u201d the report says. Watson\u2019s interest in Operation Midland \u201ccreated further pressure upon officers\u201d. Reviewing how to engage with the politician was listed among \u201cinvestigative priorities\u201d by a senior officer. Beech, a former nurse, alleged he was among the victims of an \u201cestablishment group\u201d \u2013 including politicians and military figures \u2013 who kidnapped, raped and murdered boys in the 1970s and 1980s. He accused the former prime minister Edward Heath, the ex-home secretary Leon Brittan, the former Tory MP Harvey Proctor, and the D-day veteran Field Marshal Edwin Bramall of being abusers. The homes of Lord Brittan, Lord Bramall and Proctor were raided as part of the 16-month inquiry. The report\u2019s publication has prompted Proctor to call for Cressida Dick, the Met police commissioner, to \u201cconsider her position\u201d. At the outset of Operation Midland, Dick oversaw sexual abuse and murder investigations in her role as assistant commissioner of specialist operations. Proctor\u2019s counsel Geoffrey Robertson QC said Operation Midland operated \u201calmost with institutional stupidity\u201d.

The original version of the Henriques report, published by the Met on the same day as the US presidential election in November 2016 in an apparent bid to bury coverage, found 43 failings by investigators and said detectives fell for Beech\u2019s story. Many failures were caused by \u201cpoor judgment and a failure to accurately evaluate known facts\u201d, the report found.

Reviewing how to engage with the politician was listed among \u201cinvestigative priorities\u201d by a senior officer.</p> <p>Watson, who \u201cpassed hundreds of pieces of information\u201d to Scotland Yard in November 2014, had met with Beech and encouraged him to go to the police. Henriques also said Watson, who wrote an article after Brittan\u2019s death describing him as \u201cevil\u201d, \u201cgrossly insulted\u201d the former home secretary.</p> <p>Officers investigating a separate rape claim made against Brittan may have been \u201cin a state of panic\u201d over a letter sent by Watson about the investigation, the report adds. Watson points out that his letter was actually sent to police after they had interviewed Brittan.</p> <h2><strong>Investigation should have been ended earlier as Beech was </strong><strong> \u2018inconsistent</strong><strong>\u2019</strong></h2> <p> Beech\u2019s \u201cincredible\u201d claims were littered with inconsistencies that should have led to Scotland Yard closing the 16-month investigation sooner, the report finds.</p> <p>The damning report exhaustively lists inconsistencies in the account Beech gave detectives. \u201cThe decision to terminate the investigation was correct. It should have been taken much earlier. \u2018Nick\u2019s\u2019 several statements are inconsistent and could not be relied upon in a court. Numerous errors were made in this operation,\u201d the report says.</p> <p>Henriques said Beech\u2019s claim that he identified Jimmy Savile, who he listed among his abusers, by his voice and necklace was \u201cincredible\u201d. Beech claimed Savile was at abuse sessions and held his head underwater and \u201cpenetrated\u201d him. \u201cHad that version been true \u2018Nick\u2019 would have had every opportunity to identify Savile facially,\u201d the report says.</p> <p>Henriques also said it was \u201cincredible\u201d that Beech could have suffered injuries including bruising, fractures and cuts without his mother noticing.</p> <h2><strong>Beech received information from Exaro and journalists that </strong><strong> \u2018misled\u2019</strong><strong> detectives</strong></h2> <p> Beech received information from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/21/investigative-journalism-wesite-exaro-closes\">Exaro</a>, the discredited investigative news agency that publicised his claims, and other journalists that \u201cmisled\u201d detectives and led to them concluding he was credible, according to the report.</p> <p>Exaro played a key role in amplifying Beech\u2019s allegations, which were splashed across national newspaper front pages.</p> <p>The report states: \u201cThere can be no doubt that \u2018Nick\u2019 received information and assistance from Exaro and other journalists that misled Midland officers and contributed to their concluding at an early stage that \u2018Nick\u2019 was credible.</p> <p>\u201cFor some time, parallel investigations were taking place. Exaro journalists first, and subsequently Midland officers, took \u2018Nick\u2019 on a tour of London with a view to identifying premises where \u2018Nick\u2019s\u2019 alleged abuse had occurred. Photographs were shown to \u2018Nick\u2019 by investigative journalists and names were supplied to \u2018Nick\u2019. This intrusive conduct caused difficulties for the Midland officers.\u201d</p> <p>The report notes that the BBC journalist Tom Bateman and the corporation\u2019s home affairs correspondent, Tom Symonds, met Beech. Symonds showed Beech pictures of two boys who were either murdered or went missing in the late 1970s and early 80s. Henriques says that the BBC journalists, as well as the Exaro reporter Mark Conrad and the former child protection officer Peter McKelvie, \u201cneeded to be told of the potential damage they were causing to this investigation\u201d.</p>",

Police searched the properties of the D-day veteran Lord Bramall, the ex-Tory MP Harvey Proctor and the former home secretary Leon Brittan in 2015 as part of their investigation into Carl Beech\u2019s claims of a Westminster abuse ring. But the former high court judge Sir Richard Henriques\u2019 report says police \u201cmisled\u201d the magistrate who authorised the searches by describing allegations from \u201cNick\u201d \u2013 later revealed as Beech, who has been jailed for 18 years \u2013 as \u201cconsistent\u201d and \u201ccredible\u201d. The report states: \u201cThe written applications stated that \u2018Nick\u2019s\u2019 account had remained consistent and he is felt to be a credible witness who is telling the truth. \u2018Nick\u2019s\u2019 account had not been consistent throughout. Further, there were, in my judgment, no reasonable grounds to believe \u2018Nick\u2019... \u201d He said the claim that Beech been telling the truth \u201cwas not consistent with information then available\u201d, adding that the magistrate was \u201cmisled\u201d. Police wrong to say witness was \u2018credible and true\u2019 Scotland Yard officers agreed to publicly say they believed Beech when publicising their ill-fated inquiry, Operation Midland, the report reveals. It led to Det Supt Kenny McDonald informing the media at the outset of the investigation in December 2014 that officers believed the claims made by Beech were \u201ccredible and true\u201d. Prior to the infamous statement being made, the deputy assistant commissioner Steve Rodhouse, now director of general operations at the National Crime Agency, wrote: \u201cI anticipate that Kenny [McDonald] or I will be asked if we \u2018believe\u2019 \u2018Nick\u2019. This is a significant issue and one with the potential to provide either reassurance or concern to other witnesses. \u201cAny indication that we will doubt the word of victims will undermine our efforts for them to come forward and will damage our relationship with \u2018Nick\u2019 ... Decision: If asked we will confirm that we do believe \u2018Nick\u2019 but that, as in any case, his evidence will need to be tested before it can be read out in a court.\u201d But the move was a \u201cserious mistake\u201d, Henriques says in the report, adding: \u201cI cannot conceive that any fully informed officer could reasonably have believed \u2018Nick\u2019.\u201d Tom Watson \u2018pressured\u2019 detectives The deputy Labour leader, Tom Watson, pressured detectives investigating Beech\u2019s claims, according to the report. Henriques concluded that the politician\u2019s interest in Operation Midland \u201ccreated further pressure upon officers\u201d. Reviewing how to engage with the politician was listed among \u201cinvestigative priorities\u201d by a senior officer. Watson, who \u201cpassed hundreds of pieces of information\u201d to Scotland Yard in November 2014, had met with Beech and encouraged him to go to the police. Henriques also said Watson, who wrote an article after Brittan\u2019s death describing him as \u201cevil\u201d, \u201cgrossly insulted\u201d the former home secretary. Officers investigating a separate rape claim made against Brittan may have been \u201cin a state of panic\u201d over a letter sent by Watson about the investigation, the report adds. Watson points out that his letter was actually sent to police after they had interviewed Brittan. Investigation should have been ended earlier as Beech was \u2018inconsistent\u2019 Beech\u2019s \u201cincredible\u201d claims were littered with inconsistencies that should have led to Scotland Yard closing the 16-month investigation sooner, the report finds. The damning report exhaustively lists inconsistencies in the account Beech gave detectives. \u201cThe decision to terminate the investigation was correct. It should have been taken much earlier. \u2018Nick\u2019s\u2019 several statements are inconsistent and could not be relied upon in a court. Numerous errors were made in this operation,\u201d the report says. Henriques said Beech\u2019s claim that he identified Jimmy Savile, who he listed among his abusers, by his voice and necklace was \u201cincredible\u201d. Beech claimed Savile was at abuse sessions and held his head underwater and \u201cpenetrated\u201d him. \u201cHad that version been true \u2018Nick\u2019 would have had every opportunity to identify Savile facially,\u201d the report says. Henriques also said it was \u201cincredible\u201d that Beech could have suffered injuries including bruising, fractures and cuts without his mother noticing. Beech received information from Exaro and journalists that \u2018misled\u2019 detectives Beech received information from Exaro, the discredited investigative news agency that publicised his claims, and other journalists that \u201cmisled\u201d detectives and led to them concluding he was credible, according to the report. Exaro played a key role in amplifying Beech\u2019s allegations, which were splashed across national newspaper front pages. The report states: \u201cThere can be no doubt that \u2018Nick\u2019 received information and assistance from Exaro and other journalists that misled Midland officers and contributed to their concluding at an early stage that \u2018Nick\u2019 was credible. \u201cFor some time, parallel investigations were taking place. Exaro journalists first, and subsequently Midland officers, took \u2018Nick\u2019 on a tour of London with a view to identifying premises where \u2018Nick\u2019s\u2019 alleged abuse had occurred. Photographs were shown to \u2018Nick\u2019 by investigative journalists and names were supplied to \u2018Nick\u2019. This intrusive conduct caused difficulties for the Midland officers.\u201d The report notes that the BBC journalist Tom Bateman and the corporation\u2019s home affairs correspondent, Tom Symonds, met Beech. Symonds showed Beech pictures of two boys who were either murdered or went missing in the late 1970s and early 80s. Henriques says that the BBC journalists, as well as the Exaro reporter Mark Conrad and the former child protection officer Peter McKelvie, \u201cneeded to be told of the potential damage they were causing to this investigation\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "US officials have been banned from supporting pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, after Donald Trump reportedly promised the US would stay quiet during trade negotiations. Trump gave the undertaking to his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in a phone call in June, according to CNN. The report represents the latest revelation about Trump\u2019s personal phone calls with foreign leaders, records of which were moved to a highly classified system, and have only started to emerge with the start of impeachment hearings in Congress. As a result of the gag order, the US general counsel in Hong Kong, Kurt Tong, was told to cancel an appearance at a US thinktank and a planned speech on the protests that have shaken the territory for weeks. Asked at the time whether Tong had been gagged because of trade talks, the state department spokeswoman, Morgan Ortagus, dismissed the suggestion as being \u201cbased off anonymous reports\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t see much truth to that,\u201d she said. Tong spoke at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies after he left his post in July and said it was incumbent on the US government to \u201cbe frank \u2026 and be truthful about how we view the situation on the ground in Hong Kong\u201d. Asked about the Hong Kong protests in August, Trump told reporters: \u201cSomebody said that at some point they\u2019re going to want to stop that. But that\u2019s between Hong Kong and that\u2019s between China, because Hong Kong is a part of China. They\u2019ll have to deal with that themselves. They don\u2019t need advice.\u201d Trump has also refrained from commenting on China\u2019s internment of over a million Uighur Muslims, despite the fact that his administration has made religious liberty one of its hallmark issues on the international stage. At the United Nations general assembly last month, Trump organised a meeting on the subject in the UN headquarters building, clashing with a global summit on the climate emergency on the same day. In the keynote speech on religious freedom, Trump did not mention China or the Uighurs at all, leaving it to his officials. The assistant secretary of state for east Asian and Pacific affairs, David Stilwell, organised an event at the UN on \u201cthe human rights crisis in Xinjiang\u201d. Asked whether it made it harder to convince other countries to care about the issue when the US president did not mention it, Stilwell said: \u201cClearly, I don\u2019t speak for the president.\u201d He noted that Mike Pence and the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, had mentioned it in their own remarks. \u201cI would take it as it was presented, that this Uighur issue is just \u2013 it\u2019s out there with all the rest of the issues,\u201d Stilwell said. US-Chinese trade negotiations are due to resume next week in Washington. Trump referred to the talks this week, when he suggested that Beijing start investigations into the finances of his political opponent, Joe Biden, and the former vice-president\u2019s son, Hunter.",

But it did not come out of the blue. The call to China was simply a much more public, more brazen and more reckless iteration of the very same thing that Mr Trump stands accused of doing in Ukraine, on the basis of which he is now being investigated for possible impeachment by the House of Representatives. In July, Mr Trump used a telephone call to the newly elected Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to press for investigations to be launched <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/03/us/politics/trump-ukraine.html\" title=\"\">into the Bidens</a>. If this did not happen, Mr Trump warned, the US would withhold military aid, a threat that was withdrawn after it became public.

The African American artist has built a 13-metre-tall fountain, a play on the <a href=\"https://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/st-jamess-park/things-to-see-and-do/monuments-fountains-and-statues/the-queen-victoria-memorial\" title=\"\">Queen Victoria Memorial</a> outside Buckingham Palace. It subverts the tropes of Britain\u2019s pompous public monuments, and offers a mordant commentary on the nation\u2019s enrichment through the transatlantic slave trade.</p> <p>Like the Victoria Memorial \u2013 which is peopled with allegories of Agriculture, Manufacture, Peace, Progress, Constancy and Courage, all surmounted by Victory \u2013 Walker\u2019s fountain, Fons Americanus, teems with encoded figures. The scenes on her fountain \u2013 a woman who might be Queen Victoria receiving a bowed captive, a piet\u00e0 in which a drowned figure is cradled in tender arms, a tree stump from which a noose dangles, sea captains enthroned in pomp \u2013 pulse with references to the history of empire, slavery and resistance.</p> <p>The scenes are also dense with art-historical allusions. From a scallop shell it is not Botticelli\u2019s Venus who emerges, nor the racist \u201cSable Venus\u201d used as the frontispiece to an early 19th-century British defence of the slave trade. Instead, a tear-stained face is not so much rising from the shell as sinking beneath it \u2013 a reference to the hellish pit into which uncooperative slaves were thrown to die at Bunce Island in Sierra Leone. The viewer may not recognise all the references that Walker uses. But it hardly matters: the vocabulary Walker is invoking is instantly familiar from the public monuments that scatter European cities \u2013 such as Bernini\u2019s Fountain of the Four Rivers in Rome, which claims dominion for the Catholic church over Asia, Europe, America and Africa.</p> <p>The great surmounting figure of Walker\u2019s work, from whose breasts water cascades, is not Victory, nor yet the phallic obelisk that extrudes from Bernini\u2019s sculpture, but a female figure who arches back in what might be agony \u2013 a wounded but triumphant African goddess who contains echoes of another great Bernini sculpture, The Ecstasy of Saint Teresa.</p> <p>The public monuments of the past are seldom unproblematic. Often they are hardly noticed; they form mere wallpaper to the urban experience. Frequently, they celebrate virtues and acts that are now discredited. Occasionally, they sit in such violent opposition to contemporary values that pressure mounts to rip them down. Walker\u2019s Turbine Hall commission offers a different route: she remakes the language of such monuments, bending it easily to her own purpose. Fons Americanus is a powerful work that is both harshly satirical and playfully exuberant; both a rebuke to the history of a nation, and a generous gift to it. Britain should gaze into Walker\u2019s fountain, and have the courage to recognise itself reflected in its waters.</p>",

Like the Victoria Memorial \u2013 which is peopled with allegories of Agriculture, Manufacture, Peace, Progress, Constancy and Courage, all surmounted by Victory \u2013 Walker\u2019s fountain, Fons Americanus, teems with encoded figures. The scenes on her fountain \u2013 a woman who might be Queen Victoria receiving a bowed captive, a piet\u00e0 in which a drowned figure is cradled in tender arms, a tree stump from which a noose dangles, sea captains enthroned in pomp \u2013 pulse with references to the history of empire, slavery and resistance. The scenes are also dense with art-historical allusions. From a scallop shell it is not Botticelli\u2019s Venus who emerges, nor the racist \u201cSable Venus\u201d used as the frontispiece to an early 19th-century British defence of the slave trade. Instead, a tear-stained face is not so much rising from the shell as sinking beneath it \u2013 a reference to the hellish pit into which uncooperative slaves were thrown to die at Bunce Island in Sierra Leone. The viewer may not recognise all the references that Walker uses. But it hardly matters: the vocabulary Walker is invoking is instantly familiar from the public monuments that scatter European cities \u2013 such as Bernini\u2019s Fountain of the Four Rivers in Rome, which claims dominion for the Catholic church over Asia, Europe, America and Africa. The great surmounting figure of Walker\u2019s work, from whose breasts water cascades, is not Victory, nor yet the phallic obelisk that extrudes from Bernini\u2019s sculpture, but a female figure who arches back in what might be agony \u2013 a wounded but triumphant African goddess who contains echoes of another great Bernini sculpture, The Ecstasy of Saint Teresa. The public monuments of the past are seldom unproblematic. Often they are hardly noticed; they form mere wallpaper to the urban experience. Frequently, they celebrate virtues and acts that are now discredited. Occasionally, they sit in such violent opposition to contemporary values that pressure mounts to rip them down. Walker\u2019s Turbine Hall commission offers a different route: she remakes the language of such monuments, bending it easily to her own purpose. Fons Americanus is a powerful work that is both harshly satirical and playfully exuberant; both a rebuke to the history of a nation, and a generous gift to it. Britain should gaze into Walker\u2019s fountain, and have the courage to recognise itself reflected in its waters.",

He probably still is \u2013 but the outcome of the race looks considerably more uncertain. James Morris, the managing director of the consultancy Edelman and a former pollster to Ed Miliband, said: \u201cSadiq was overwhelming favourite yesterday, and he still is today, but it does shake it up.\u201d Party loyalties are increasingly weak, said Morris, and voters tend to see a city mayoralty as the kind of job they are willing to hand over to a high-profile maverick (Boris Johnson, Ken Livingstone). \u201cThere is a path where someone who is new, and not seen as partisan, and is a bit more fresh, could cut through,\u201d he said. Stewart\u2019s quirky campaign for the Conservative leadership won him acres of publicity and a throng of enthusiastic supporters \u2013 though not nearly enough of them were the Tory MPs whose votes he needed. In his favour is the fact that the Conservative candidate for London mayor, Shaun Bailey, has so far made little impact on the public\u2019s consciousness. Stewart will stand as an anti-politician in an anti-politics moment, despite having been very much a politician when he sought to be Tory leader a few months ago. He is likely to have the considerable firepower of George Osborne\u2019s Evening Standard behind him \u2013 the former chancellor being another Conservative who quickly dropped a northern seat when other ambitions beckoned. Yet unlike in the Tory leadership race, which by the end had turned into little more than a Brexit virility contest, Stewart will be standing against other candidates who also represent tolerance and diversity. In his campaign launch video, he speaks of improving people\u2019s lives, \u201cnot through division but through love.

      "bodyText": "Thousands of people swept into the streets of Hong Kong for a night of protests marked by violence after the government activated sweeping colonial-era powers for the first time in over half a century, using them to ban face masks. The chief executive, Carrie Lam, also said harsher measures could be on the table if the protest movement continued, amid calls from police groups and pro-Beijing politicians for a citywide curfew, and discussion of delays to local elections set for November. The government appeared braced for more clashes between police and protesters before Lam\u2019s announcement that she had invoked the emergency regulations ordinance and passed a law forbidding the use of face masks. Government employees were sent home early, all after-school activities were cancelled, and many shopping malls, banks and businesses shuttered. Shortly after she finished a two-hour press conference, the first groups of protesters were filtering on to the streets of Hong Kong island. After darkness fell, crowds set fire to two metro stations and vandalised shops and businesses considered pro-China; police responded with teargas, and in at least one case live ammunition. There were reports that a student had been hit in the thigh by a bullet, after a group of protesters attacked an off-duty police officer. Hospital authorities said they had received a 14-year-old boy, who was in a serious condition. At the press conference to announce the new anti-mask law, Lam said that if violence was not halted the government would not rule out any measures permitted by law. \u201cFreedoms are not without limits,\u201d she told journalists. The emergency regulations ordinance, created by British authorities to break up port strikes in 1922, had not been used for more than half a century, and never since the handover of Hong Kong to Chinese rule in 1997. It gives Lam virtually unlimited powers, although legal scholars said the government could be challenged in court if anything it did violated the Basic Law, the territory\u2019s constitution. \u201cWe have the duty to use all available means to stop the escalating violence and restore calmness in society,\u201d Lam said in a combative press conference unveiling the new law. \u201cThe decision to invoke the emergency regulations ordinance is a difficult, but also a necessary one for public interest.\u201d Masks have become common among protesters who fear either arrest now, or retaliation from Hong Kong and Chinese authorities in the longer term if they are identified. But the ban seemed unlikely to deter crowds who have already defied multiple government bans to turn out on illegal marches and demonstrations. Activists and rights groups warned the mask ban might pave the way for fiercer controls on public life, once the government had tested public and legal response to using the emergency ordinance. Asked whether she would consider other measures proposed by pro-Beijing politicians, including a curfew or a delay to upcoming local elections, Lam said everything was on the table. \u201cIf the violence escalates, as a responsible government, we must make use of existing legal provisions,\u201d she said. \u201cWe would not rule out any measures that we can reasonably implement under the current law.\u201d Later she added: \u201cFreedoms are not without limits, OK, so there are things which one has to strike a balance, dealing with a particular situation.\u201d Protesters, rights groups and academics denounced the use of emergency powers as a gross abuse of power, and a dangerous precedent for a city that for the last 20 years has enjoyed an unusual combination of civic freedoms without full democratic rule. \u201cToday, she declared that the authoritarian government can take away your freedoms any time,\u201d said Prof Ma Ngok, political scientist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. He added that the new law would likely prove impossible to enforce and counterproductive, provoking \u201can even larger and more violent resistance\u201d. The regulation came into effect at midnight on Friday and bars all face coverings, including paint, at any public gathering, on pain of a fine and a year in jail. In the testy press conference, one journalist put on his gas mask and protective goggles and shouted at Lam: \u201cWould I be arrested if I am dressed like this while working?\u201d Officials said there would be exemptions for anyone who covered their face for health, religious or professional reasons. Despite the sense of crisis, and the deployment of emergency powers, Lam insisted that the city was not in a state of emergency. The ordinance also covered situations where there was a \u201cdanger to public order\u201d, she said. The city was wracked by the worst violence of the four-month-old protest movement on Tuesday, as crowds fought pitched battles with police across the city and an officer shot a teenage student in the chest. The government\u2019s response to that chaos and and an outpouring of grief and anger over the injured student, suggested a worrying lack of flexibility in tackling the city\u2019s crisis, said Jean-Philippe B\u00e9ja, research emeritus professor at the centre for international studies and research at Sciences Po in Paris. \u201cThe only thing that they have come up with is using a police response to solve political problems,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a further restriction on HK\u2019s freedoms, but the way it is implemented is more worrying than the law itself because it\u2019s completely arbitrary.\u201d \u2022 Additional reporting by Verna Yu",

Coming on stage to read a letter from Eton about the then-schoolboy Boris Johnson, sent to his father, Stanley, Stewart told the audience of thousands: \u201cThis letter constitutes my resignation from the Conservative party.\u201d While it was not immediately clear whether his comments should be taken seriously, on Friday morning he tweeted: \u201cIt\u2019s been a great privilege to serve Penrith and The Border for the last 10 years, so it is with sadness that I am announcing that I will be standing down at the next election, and that I have also resigned from the Conservative party.\u201d He timed his announcement to fit in with the print deadline for his local paper, the Cumberland and Westmorland Herald, based in Penrith, writing how \u201cso much of what I love about Britain lies in Cumbria\u201d. Just 14 minutes after his 10.30am announcement with his local paper, Stewart revealed his intention to run as mayor of London, leaving local reporters scrambling before their deadline. Images on his website were swiftly changed from fields of animals to the London skyline. Some local Conservatives and constituents were said to be disappointed at his move but understood his decision, with many paying tribute to Stewart\u2019s service to the constituency, understanding of the farming community, leading a campaign for rural broadband and his work in the aftermath of Storm Desmond. Stewart had hinted that some in his local association did not want him to run again in the next election, expected to be held this autumn. The fformer Lib Dem leader Tim Farron, whose constituency Westmorland and Lonsdale abuts Stewart\u2019s, said: \u201cI\u2019m not surprised really but I am very sad for him \u2026 I don\u2019t agree with him on a few things but he is very dedicated to public service and he just feels that the future of the party that he has been in doesn\u2019t provide a home for him. \u201cI think there was a reasonable chance he could have won Penrith and The Border \u2013 he was a very respected local MP. A lot of people not of his political colours voted for him. People were proud of him and that he was their MP.\u201d Farron said he did not expect Stewart would win the London mayoralty against Labour\u2019s Sadiq Khan, as he may end up splitting the vote from the Tory candidate, Shaun Bailey, and the Lib Dem candidate, Siobhan Benita. The bookmaker Coral said that after a flurry of bets the odds on Stewart becoming mayor were as short as 2-1.",

      "bodyText": "Prince Harry has issued legal proceedings against the owners of the Sun and the Daily Mirror over alleged phone hacking, in an escalation of his all-out war with the British newspaper industry. The decision follows Harry\u2019s strongly worded attack on the British media\u2019s treatment of his wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex. Buckingham Palace confirmed claims had been filed at the high court regarding alleged illegal interception of voicemail messages. News Group, which published the News of the World until its closure as well as the Sun, confirmed a claim had been issued. The claims could refer to historical cases. Harry and his brother, Prince William, were at the centre of a series of hacking allegations after it emerged in the early 2000s that tabloid journalists were routinely accessing public figures\u2019 voicemails to find stories. The claims were filed by Clintons, a law firm that has brought multiple phone-hacking claims in the past and won substantial payouts on behalf of its clients. The filings were made days before Meghan launched a separate legal action against the Mail on Sunday for alleged breach of privacy and copyright infringement over its decision to publish a private letter she had sent to her estranged father. Court filings of 27 September, first reported by Byline Investigates, suggest two separate claims were made in the prince\u2019s name against Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Group Newspapers and the Reach plc subsidiary MGN Ltd last week. Issuing proceedings is the first court step of possible legal action against a defendant. Once papers are lodged with the court, the claimant has four months to decide whether to proceed with the action by serving the defendant.

In that case, Meghan and Harry, who are on a 10-day tour of southern Africa, employed the libel lawyers Schillings using private funds. Harry accused parts of the media of \u201cwaging campaigns against individuals with no thought to the consequences\u201d. Emphasising his respect for the importance of \u201cobjective, truthful reporting\u201d, he added: \u201cThough this action may not be the safe one, it is the right one \u2026 I\u2019ve seen what happens when someone I love is commoditised to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person. \u201cI lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.\u201d Hostilities between Harry and the tabloid press have been escalating since his relationship with Meghan began.

      "body": "<p>Anna Quayle, who has died aged 86, was a multitalented and versatile actor with saucer eyes, a flirtatious smile and a sardonic touch. She could be both playful and deadpan, and was as adept at a sly aside as she was at delivering a musical number with wit and gusto, whether on stage, film or TV.</p> <p>It was as the unforgettable Baroness Bomburst in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968) that she broke through on the big screen, duetting with Gert Fr\u00f6be on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aak6BqNR150\" title=\"\">number Chu-Chi Face</a>, where the couple declare undying love for each other as he attempts to kill her by various slapstick means.</p> <p>More than 20 years later she was still a familiar face on British television screens, as the eccentric but good-hearted teacher <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w-SGtkv_Yo\" title=\"\">Mrs Monroe </a>in the groundbreaking children\u2019s drama Grange Hill (1990-94).</p> <p>But it was on the stage that Quayle\u2019s many talents were honed, and shone. In 1960, the actor and singer-songwriter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/apr/16/guardianobituaries1\" title=\"\">Anthony Newley </a>came to see her in the revue And Another Thing, alongside Bernard Cribbins and Lionel Blair, at the Fortune theatre in London\u2019s West End, and thought her perfect for the female lead in his musical Stop The World \u2013 I Want to Get Off (1961). Written and scored by Newley and Leslie Bricusse, it was an odyssey following its lead character, Littlechap (Newley), from cradle to grave. Quayle was cast as the four women in his life \u2013 wife Evie, the Russian Anya, German Ilse and American Ginnie \u2013 showcasing her vocal dexterity and mastery of comic, dramatic and musical material.</p> <p>The show began in Manchester but soon transferred to the Queen\u2019s theatre in the West End, and Quayle won the London Critics Circle award for her performance. She accompanied the show to Broadway in 1962, where it ran for 555 performances (first at the Shubert theatre before transferring to the Ambassador). At the 1963 Tony awards it was nominated in five categories (including best musical) but won only one \u2013 Quayle bagging best performance by a featured actress in a musical.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"50ba7b159c4e0827c8eb5c2d336921c613bbc23a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50ba7b159c4e0827c8eb5c2d336921c613bbc23a/0_30_3577_2146/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anna Quayle with Ronnie Corbett in the 1967 James Bond send-up Casino Royale.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anna Quayle with Ronnie Corbett in the 1967 James Bond send-up Casino Royale.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Columbia/Famous Artists/Kobal/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Born in Birmingham as Anne, she was the eldest child of actor-manager Douglas Quayle and his wife Kathleen (nee Parke), and was educated at the Catholic girls\u2019 Convent of Jesus and Mary Language College in Harlesden, north London. A theatrical career was inevitable: she had already made her stage debut, aged three, in one of her father\u2019s productions, the first of many such engagements.</p> <p>While studying at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (1955-56), she decided that her future career was more likely to be in comedy than tragedy. Immediately upon graduation she was at the Edinburgh fringe in the revue show Better Late (1956), before providing comic support for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/jan/03/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\" title=\"\">Cyril Fletcher </a>in Summer Masquerade at the Sandown Pavilion, Isle of Wight (1957).</p> <p>Other revue appearances followed, in Do You Mind?

      "bodyText": "Anna Quayle, who has died aged 86, was a multitalented and versatile actor with saucer eyes, a flirtatious smile and a sardonic touch. She could be both playful and deadpan, and was as adept at a sly aside as she was at delivering a musical number with wit and gusto, whether on stage, film or TV. It was as the unforgettable Baroness Bomburst in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968) that she broke through on the big screen, duetting with Gert Fr\u00f6be on the number Chu-Chi Face, where the couple declare undying love for each other as he attempts to kill her by various slapstick means. More than 20 years later she was still a familiar face on British television screens, as the eccentric but good-hearted teacher Mrs Monroe in the groundbreaking children\u2019s drama Grange Hill (1990-94). But it was on the stage that Quayle\u2019s many talents were honed, and shone. In 1960, the actor and singer-songwriter Anthony Newley came to see her in the revue And Another Thing, alongside Bernard Cribbins and Lionel Blair, at the Fortune theatre in London\u2019s West End, and thought her perfect for the female lead in his musical Stop The World \u2013 I Want to Get Off (1961). Written and scored by Newley and Leslie Bricusse, it was an odyssey following its lead character, Littlechap (Newley), from cradle to grave. Quayle was cast as the four women in his life \u2013 wife Evie, the Russian Anya, German Ilse and American Ginnie \u2013 showcasing her vocal dexterity and mastery of comic, dramatic and musical material. The show began in Manchester but soon transferred to the Queen\u2019s theatre in the West End, and Quayle won the London Critics Circle award for her performance. She accompanied the show to Broadway in 1962, where it ran for 555 performances (first at the Shubert theatre before transferring to the Ambassador). At the 1963 Tony awards it was nominated in five categories (including best musical) but won only one \u2013 Quayle bagging best performance by a featured actress in a musical. Born in Birmingham as Anne, she was the eldest child of actor-manager Douglas Quayle and his wife Kathleen (nee Parke), and was educated at the Catholic girls\u2019 Convent of Jesus and Mary Language College in Harlesden, north London. A theatrical career was inevitable: she had already made her stage debut, aged three, in one of her father\u2019s productions, the first of many such engagements. While studying at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (1955-56), she decided that her future career was more likely to be in comedy than tragedy. Immediately upon graduation she was at the Edinburgh fringe in the revue show Better Late (1956), before providing comic support for Cyril Fletcher in Summer Masquerade at the Sandown Pavilion, Isle of Wight (1957). Other revue appearances followed, in Do You Mind? (Edinburgh Palladium, 1959) and Look Who\u2019s Here! (Fortune theatre, 1960, her West End debut), which led to And Another Thing at the same theatre later that year. After Stop the World \u2013 I Want to Get Off she appeared in Homage to TS Eliot (Globe theatre, 1965), Full Circle, her own one-woman musical show (Apollo theatre, 1970), Out of Bounds at the Bristol Old Vic (1973), and Pal Joey, as Melba Snyder, at the Oxford Playhouse (and later the Edinburgh festival, 1976). She hit the West End again in Anthony Shaffer\u2019s The Case of the Oily Levantine (Her Majesty\u2019s theatre, 1979), played Madame Arcati in a 1980 tour of Blithe Spirit, Madame Dubonnet in Sandy Wilson\u2019s The Boy Friend (Old Vic, 1984) and Marigold in After October (Chichester Festival theatre, 1997). Her first notable film role came in the Beatles vehicle A Hard Day\u2019s Night (1964) as Millie, who recognises but cannot quite place an incognito John Lennon. Other big-screen appearances included opposite Tony Curtis in Drop Dead Darling (1966), the swinging London musical Smashing Time (1967), the James Bond spoof Casino Royale (1967), Up the Chastity Belt (with Frankie Howerd, 1972) and The Seven-Per-Cent Solution (1976). On television she was in classics including Not Only \u2026 But Also (1965) and The Avengers (1967), and was just as comfortable in high-end fare such as BBC Shakespeare (as Alice in Henry V, 1979), Brideshead Revisited (1981) and Mapp &amp; Lucia (1986) as she was opposite such children\u2019s icons as Basil Brush (1977) and Sooty (1987).

The lack of any concrete diagnosis and the frequency of her visits led one GP to suggest, while pointing to his own stomach, \u201cThe problem\u2019s not in here, I think it\u2019s in here,\u201d moving his finger to tap the side of his head. \u201cYou get treated basically like a hypochondriac,\u201d she says. \u201cYou feel ashamed.\u201d Eventually, after advice on patient forums, she sought an appointment with Prof James Malone Lee, who runs a specialist clinic in London. His approach of prescribing long courses of antibiotics has won support among patients, but remains controversial within the medical profession. Lavender ended up taking antibiotics almost continuously for 26 months before she came off drugs completely and says that she has now made a full recovery. \u201cI cycle into Leeds every day, I run, I swim, I\u2019ve got a completely normal life now,\u201d she says. \u201cI do everything with my daughter that I couldn\u2019t do for a few years.\u201d The latest NHS Digital data gives a breakdown of figures for both chronic cystitis and chronic interstitial cystitis. These numbers were combined to give the chronic UTI figures in this piece (both diagnoses, taken separately, also show an increase).",

      "bodyText": "The Ladbroke Grove train crash occurred 20 years ago on 5 October 1999. Thirty-one people died and more than 250 were injured. It was the last of a series of serious accidents. Since then the safety record of British railways has been among the best in the world. The Piper Alpha disaster killed over 150 oil workers a decade earlier. As with the Ladbroke Grove crash, there has been no similar accident since that event. In both cases, the public inquiry into the disasters was chaired by Lord Cullen, a senior Scottish judge. He also ran the inquiry into the Dunblane school shooting. To the best of my knowledge, no child has been injured by a gun in a school in the UK since. As someone injured in the train crash, I want to record my appreciation for Lord Cullen\u2019s thorough and painstaking work into these three disasters. I know that his investigations resulted in major changes to safety practices on the railways. His fair-minded rigour has probably saved hundreds of lives across the UK. On the anniversary of the awful accident at Ladbroke Grove, we should celebrate his success.

      "bodyText": "An army training march on a hot summer\u2019s day in which a soldier collapsed and died should not have gone ahead, a heat expert has told an inquest. The expert said a key piece of equipment used in the military to assess heat during exercise was \u201cerroneously\u201d placed in the shade of a building and its readings could not be relied on. Cpl Joshua Hoole, 26, collapsed during an annual fitness test in south Wales on the morning of 19 July 2016. Three years earlier, three army reservists sustained fatal heat illness in an SAS selection march close to the same spot in the Brecon Beacons. Hoole, of Ecclefechan, southern Scotland, was a quarter of a mile from the end of the eight-mile (13km) cross-country course, carrying 25kg (55lb). From leading the march, he rapidly fell back through the pack, complaining of cramps, before collapsing at 8.52am. He was pronounced dead less than an hour later. Eighteen out of a total of 41 soldiers dropped out, collapsed or were withdrawn by the course directing staff on the day. On Friday, Prof George Havenith, a heat stress and heat strain expert from Loughborough University, told the inquest in Birmingham that the wet bulb globe temperature device used to measure heat produced an \u201cerroneous\u201d result because it was in the shade of a gym building. \u201cI was convinced that any point taken before 10am was definitely an incorrect measurement,\u201d he said. Asked on a balance of probabilities whether the march should have gone ahead, Havenith said it should not. Asked if Hoole would be alive if the exercise had not been run or had been stopped half an hour before he collapsed, Havenith replied: \u201cYes.\u201d Witnesses said another soldier, L/Cpl George Knight, blacked out and fell into a hedge about an hour before Hoole became ill. Questioned about Knight\u2019s collapse, Col Christopher Wright, a military doctor in emergency medicine, said: \u201cI had come to the conclusion that it should have been treated as a suspected heat injury.\u201d Asked by the senior coroner, Louise Hunt, what he would have expected to have happened if a potential heat injury had been identified, Wright said: \u201cThe exercise has to stop.\u201d The fitness test continued, however, and more soldiers dropped out or were withdrawn. Hunt also presided over the 2015 inquest into the deaths of the three men after the SAS march. At the end of that hearing, she concluded there was a \u201ccatalogue of very serious mistakes\u201d by many people involved in the planning and execution of the exercise, and called for changes to how marches were organised on hot days. The inquest continues.",

For so long the 26-year-old was the bridesmaid but never the bride at a world championships or Olympic Games. And she had so many setbacks, injuries and plunges into sinkholes of self-doubt while competing in the heptathlon that after the Rio Games in 2016 \u2013 where poor shot put and javelin performances cost her a medal \u2013 she wondered whether she should just stick to the long jump or high jump.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/03/katarina-johnson-thompson-tore-everything-up\">Katarina Johnson-Thompson says she \u2018tore everything up\u2019 to win world title</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cIt was probably in the moment at the time,\u201d she said. \u201cI was fed up of not doing a victory lap because I was injured and knowing that my body could not respond, or feeling it couldn\u2019t make it through, or that my performances were not up to scratch to compete.</p> \n<p>\u201c I changed my life after that competition.

      "bodyText": "Throughout Katarina Johnson-Thompson\u2019s career she has often seemed the living epitomy of the Chumbawamba song Tubthumping: she gets down, but she gets up again, and nothing is going to keep her down. But the morning after winning the world heptathlon title \u2013 and smashing Jessica Ennis-Hill\u2019s British record in the process \u2013 she had a confession to make: there was a moment when she nearly gave up on the event. Who could have blamed her? For so long the 26-year-old was the bridesmaid but never the bride at a world championships or Olympic Games. And she had so many setbacks, injuries and plunges into sinkholes of self-doubt while competing in the heptathlon that after the Rio Games in 2016 \u2013 where poor shot put and javelin performances cost her a medal \u2013 she wondered whether she should just stick to the long jump or high jump. \u201cIt was probably in the moment at the time,\u201d she said. \u201cI was fed up of not doing a victory lap because I was injured and knowing that my body could not respond, or feeling it couldn\u2019t make it through, or that my performances were not up to scratch to compete. \u201c I changed my life after that competition. I didn\u2019t want to give up on something I truly believed.\u201d Johnson-Thompson estimated she had barely an hour\u2019s sleep after winning gold as she tried to process how she had managed to not only become the first person to lower the colours of Belgium\u2019s Olympic champion Nafi Thiam since May 2016 \u2013 but beat her by more than 300 points while setting four personal bests. \u201cI think it\u2019s relief, going into my fourth world championships that something bad hasn\u2019t happened again,\u201d she added, smiling. \u201cI knew I was in good shape, but in the past I\u2019ve been in good shape and it hasn\u2019t always come off.

She had little grasp of the language or culture but knew she was moving to a world-renowned group run by Bertrand Valcin, that includes Kevin Mayer, the 2017 decathlon world champion. It took her a while to settle in, and she still has only a smattering of French, but she is comfortable cycling to training and getting to the beach more easily after training now Montpellier has embraced Uber. More importantly she has become a more rounded and less injury-prone athlete. \u201cI used to want certain scores,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted two metres in the high jump, seven metres in the long jump, 7,000 points in the heptathlon.

      "body": "<p>Whether you\u2019re new to skiing or boarding or have been on the slopes pretty much since you could walk, there are certain codes of conduct which should be followed. Should you strike up conversation on a chairlift? When is it OK to take a selfie? Is it alright to wear an 80s ski suit? Neilson Mountain Expert Sarah Watson offers some tips.</p> <p><strong>The skier in front has right of way<br></strong>Forget everything you learned in your Highway Code, the rules of the road count for nothing here. The skier in front (lower down the slope) always has right of way over you.

      "bodyText": "Whether you\u2019re new to skiing or boarding or have been on the slopes pretty much since you could walk, there are certain codes of conduct which should be followed. Should you strike up conversation on a chairlift? When is it OK to take a selfie? Is it alright to wear an 80s ski suit? Neilson Mountain Expert Sarah Watson offers some tips. The skier in front has right of way Forget everything you learned in your Highway Code, the rules of the road count for nothing here. The skier in front (lower down the slope) always has right of way over you. It doesn\u2019t matter how slowly they are going or how wide their traverse might be, you don\u2019t have the right to cut them up. \u201cRemember, you were a beginner once too!\u201d says Watson. Stop somewhere sensible You might have just spotted a cute marmot or the perfect place for a selfie, but think before you stop on the slopes. \u201cUnless you have fallen or you are helping someone else who has, always stop at the side of the piste,\u201d says Watson. \u201cAlso, don\u2019t stop in a blind spot just after the crest of the hill \u2013 you won\u2019t be seen and you risk being mown down by someone perfecting their jump. You should also avoid stopping where pistes cross.\u201d Don\u2019t get stuck in the wrong place Some ski areas are huge, with several different valleys. If you don\u2019t start making your way back to your \u201chome\u201d resort early enough, you could miss the last lift and be landed with a very large taxi or hotel bill. \u201cI\u2019ve had clients, especially ones who are fairly new to skiing, who have underestimated the amount of time it will take to get back and got stuck, to their cost,\u201d says Watson. \u201cI recommend allowing at least 15 minutes for each lift \u2013 sometimes over 30 minutes during peak times.\u201d Some lifts go down as well as up If the weather\u2019s closed in, the snow\u2019s getting icy or you\u2019re simply too tired for one more run, many lifts will carry people down the slopes as well as up. \u201cFatigue is a factor in many accidents,\u201d says Watson. \u201cThere\u2019s no shame in taking the gondola down if you feel like it.\u201d Always carry a piste map You might be used to Google Maps or the like for finding your way around, but when it comes to skiing, it pays to be old school.

      "bodyText": "BP boss Bob Dudley will step down as chief executive almost a decade after steering the oil major back from the brink of collapse following the Deepwater Horizon disaster. The company said Dudley would end his four-decade career at BP early next year and be replaced in February by insider Bernard Looney, 49, currently head of exploration and production. BP\u2019s chairman, Helge Lund, said the company owes Dudley, who earned $14.7m (\u00a311.7m) last year, a debt of gratitude for his work rebuilding the company after the deadly oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. He credited Dudley with steering the company through \u201cprobably the most challenging time in BP\u2019s history\u201d to help \u201cre-earn its position as one of the leaders of the energy sector\u201d. The worst oil spill in US history, which killed 11 people and took a heavy toll on local communities and the environment, pushed BP close to financial collapse and cost the company more than $65bn in compensation. The second half of Dudley\u2019s tenure as chief executive was marked by one of the most severe oil market downturns in history, in which global oil prices plunged from more than $100 a barrel to 12-year lows of under $30 a barrel in early 2016. Last year, BP said it had doubled its profits from the year before to $12.7bn, its highest in five years and well above the expectations of industry analysts. It also agreed a $10.5bn deal to buy BHP Billiton\u2019s US shale business, its biggest acquisition since Macondo. Dudley could receive up to \u00a340m in company shares after he leaves, earned through the company\u2019s bonus scheme over the last decade that are linked to BP\u2019s performance and have yet to be paid out. He has received a total of about $116.5m while chief executive of BP. His biggest payout, a remuneration package worth $19.4m for 2015, followed record losses at the company, thousands of job cuts and a pay freeze for employees.

Looney said he was looking forward to \u201cbuilding on the strong foundation\u201d left by Dudley to \u201cmeet society\u2019s demand for cleaner, better energy\u201d. BP is under fierce pressure from activists and investors to reduce its carbon footprint, and take responsibility for its contribution to the climate crisis by moving away from oil production towards renewable electricity and alternative fuels. Earlier this week the Royal Shakespeare Company said it would end its sponsorship deal with the company amid growing opposition to fossil fuel sponsorship of many of the UK\u2019s leading cultural institutions. Lund said BP\u2019s incoming chief executive \u201chas all the right qualities\u201d to help BP chart a new course through a \u201ctransformational era\u201d towards a low-carbon future. \u201cHe has deep experience in the energy sector, has risen through the ranks of BP, and has consistently delivered strong safety, operational and financial performance. He is an authentic, progressive leader, with a passion for purpose and people and a clear sense of what BP must do to thrive through the energy transition,\u201d he said. Looney, an Irish citizen, first joined BP in 1991 as a drilling engineer and took control of the company\u2019s exploration and production business at the depths of the oil market crash in the spring of 2016. He has worked for the company in the North Sea, the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska. Dudley described his successor as \u201ca terrific choice\u201d who \u201cknows BP and our industry as well as anyone but is creative and not bound by traditional ways of working\u201d. \u201cIt has been the privilege of a lifetime to serve this company and work in this industry for the past four decades. I have worked with so many committed people from all over the world \u2013 both inside and outside BP \u2013 and I am enormously proud of all the things we have achieved together to provide energy for the world,\u201d Dudley said.",

Defender Adam Smith (hamstring) and midfielder Dan Gosling (hip) are both closing in on a return as they step up their recovery. Defender Chris Mepham has withdrawn from the Wales squad with an unspecified injury, while midfielder David Brooks (ankle), left-back Charlie Daniels (knee) and winger Junior Stanislas (knee) all continue their own rehabilitation. Arsenal news: Arsenal have no fresh injury concerns as head coach Unai Emery prepares to welcome back a host of first-team regulars for Sunday\u2019s Premier League visit of Bournemouth. Emery made 10 changes for Thursday\u2019s Europa League win over Standard Liege with the likes of Granit Xhaka, Bernd Leno, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Matteo Guendouzi all likely to return. Striker Alexandre Lacazette (ankle) and midfielder Emile Smith Rowe (concussion) are the only absentees with forward Bukayo Saka available having suffered from cramp in the latter stages of Monday\u2019s draw at Manchester United.

It\u2019s important that you stay on working and believe in yourself. I try to help him as much as I can - give him a lot of trust and still trust him. I\u2019m sure that he will help us in the future and games will come that he will score.\u201d Norwich City news: The injury-ravaged club had some good news when it emerged Jamal Lewis will be available for the Premier League match against Aston Villa. His elbow problem is not as bad as initially feared. Veteran Northern Ireland goalkeeper Michael McGovern will start, with Ralf Fahrmann (groin) joining Tim Krul (back) on the sidelines, while Archie Mair will be promoted from the Under-23s as cover. Defender Ben Godfrey, set for a hernia operation during the international break, will be available, while full-back Sam Byram (ankle) and midfielder Todd Cantwell (hamstring) are slight doubts. Centre-half Grant Hanley (groin) misses out. Alex Tettey (groin), Mario Vrancic (calf), Tom Trybull (ankle), Onel Hernandez (knee), Christoph Zimmermann (foot) and Timm Klose (knee) all continue their rehabilitation. Ouch! Crystal Palace news: Roy Hodgson has defended his striker Christian Benteke, who looks utterly bereft of confidence, has yet to get off the mark this season and has scored just four times in his past 58 games for Crystal Palace. Responding to comments made by former Palace midfielder John Salako, who claimed Benteke has \u201cbeen awful\u201d in his time at Selhurst Park, Hodgson went on the offensive. \u201cI am always disappointed when professionals criticise fellow professionals, even if they are ex-professionals,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that you do need to be careful in terms of abusing your profession in a way, by criticising other professionals without properly knowing all the details you would need to know. \u201cWe here see Christian trying his level best every week to get back to goalscoring form. We do our level best to help him, and let\u2019s hope that day will come soon.\u201d Manchester City news: Pep Guardiola has confirmed Kevin De Bruyne will not be fit to face Wolves on Sunday. The Belgium international missed the midweek Champions League clash with Dinamo Zagreb due to a groin injury. \u201cHe is not fit,\u201d said Guardiola. \u201cAfter the international break he will be ready. It is not a big problem.\u201d Asked for his reaction to the Football Association\u2019s decision to charge Bernardo Silva with misconduct over his social media post about team-mate Benjamin Mendy, Guardiola said: \u201cNo comments anymore.\u201d If only he\u2019d said that the first time he was asked for his thoughts on the matter, eh? Matchday: Inside FC Barcelona: Narrated by John Malkovich, this has the potential to be diabolically bad (hello Manchester City\u2019s Fight Til The End) or ridiculously good (thanks, Sunderland Til I Die). My money is on the former, but time will tell. Some good news for Liverpool fans ... Alisson is back in training after recovering from the calf injury that forced him off the pitch during Liverpool\u2019s opening match of the season against Norwich City. According to Andy Hunter, our man on the Mersey-beat, it is unclear whether or not the Brazilian goalkeeper will feature against Leicester City tomorrow. Having stood in for Alisson since he went off, Liverpool\u2019s summer acquisition, Adrian, has done very little wrong. Podcast: Philippe Auclair and Football 365\u2019s John Nicholson were the special studio guests to help myself and Max Rushden pick over the bones of the midweek Champions League action. John also discussed his new book, Can We Have Our Football Back (How The Premier League Is Ruining Football And What We Can Do About It). It does exactly what it says on the tin. You can listen to the podcast here, or sign up and download in all the usual podcast places. Warning: parental advisory: With his team trailing 3-1 against Liverpool at half-time at Anfield in the Champions League on Tuesday night, RB Salzburg\u2019s American manager Jesse Marsch cut loose ... in a variety of languages, some of them profane. The former Liverpool and Wales striker has won an appeal against a jail sentence for failing to take a breath test. Saunders, 55, was jailed for 10 weeks in August after admitting failing to comply with a roadside breath test and failing to provide a breath specimen when he was stopped in an Audi A8 by a police patrol car in Chester on 10 May after spending the afternoon at the races. Saunders, who also played for Aston Villa, Derby County, Nottingham Forest, Galatasaray and Benfica, had his jail term quashed and suspended for 18 months. Judge Steven Everett ordered him to do 200 hours of unpaid work in the community. He has also been suspended from driving for 30 months. \u201cI want to apologise to the Court, my family and all of the people I have let down as a result of my actions.,\u201d said Saunders in a statement, released through the League Managers\u2019 Association. \u201cI made a terrible error of judgement for which I have been rightly punished, and I wholeheartedly regret that it happened. I accept that I have been given an opportunity by the Court and I hope that people can learn from my experience. The message is a simple one - don\u2019t ever drink and drive. \u201cI will learn from this and become a better person. I would like to thank everyone who has given me support and guidance throughout this time.\u201d Harry who? Despite selling their most prized central defender to Manchester United for \u00a380m during the past window, Leicester City still have the joint-tightest defence in the Premier League. Ahead of their visit to Anfield, where they will take on equally parsimonious Liverpool tomorrow afternoon, Paul Doyle explains all ... Bournemouth news: Eddie Howe has said he will not entertain \u201cpointless\u201d transfer speculation over England striker Callum Wilson, who has scored five goals in his past five games for Bournemouth. The striker is one of many players reported to be on Manchester United\u2019s January shopping list and has previously been linked with a move to Chelsea. \u201cI take with a pinch of salt, to be honest, at this stage of the season,\u201d said Howe, when asked about rumours regarding the 27-year-old\u2019s future. \u201cThere is nothing that we can do, that Callum can do, other than perform well. That influences rumours and things like that at this stage of the season. \u201cHe has just got to focus on his next game and give his best for this club. To hear transfer links and rumours at this stage when the window is shut and a long way from being open, for me, it is pointless talking about it.\u201d Bournemouth travel to the Emirates this weekend for a Sunday afternoon game against Arsenal. Their defender, Chris Mepham, has withdrawn from the Wales squad because of an unspecified injury. Kieran Tierney speaks: Now recovered from injury, Arsenal\u2019s young summer acquisition was chatting following his side\u2019s emphatic Europa League win over Standard Liege last night. As well as the usual bland platitudes about how difficult a decision it was to leave Celtic, what a \u201cmassive\u201d club Arsenal are and how he wants to win trophies with them, the 22-year-old spoke about the adjustments he has had to make since moving out of his parents\u2019 house and heading to \u201cdown the road\u201d \u2013 as they say in Scotland \u2013 to the Big Smoke. \u201cIt is a massive change for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI was a home boy, I always stayed with my parents, and I\u2019ve come down here to a different country, a massive city. But so far everybody at the club has helped me settle and I am very grateful for that. \u201cI need to cook every night so I am learning. I will get there. People say what\u2019s the city like? I have no idea, I\u2019ve never been in. \u201cI train, I work hard, I go home and recover and train the next day. It is just a simple life and I just put everything into football and all I can to just try and reap the rewards.\u201d Some rare good news for Spurs fans: Tottenham duo Giovani Lo Celso and Ryan Sessegnon are \u201centering the final stages of rehabilitation\u201d from their injuries. The pair, who both arrived on transfer deadline day, have been sidelined with respective hip and hamstring injuries, but they are on the mend and likely to be fit after the international break. Serge Aurier is the only other player missing for this weekend\u2019s game against Brighton. He serves a one-match ban following his dismissal for two bookable offences against Southampton last weekend. Thibaut Courtois latest: The Real Madrid goalkeeper has had rather a torrid time of it since leaving Chelsea for the Bernab\u00e9u and seemed to plumb new depths when he let in two soft first-half goals and was replaced at half-time during his side\u2019s 2-2 draw with Club Brugge in the Champions League on Tuesday. Having fallen out of favour with the fans, Real Madrid have issued a statement responding to rumours that their Belgian goalkeeper has been diagnosed with anxiety. Here\u2019s what they had to say ... Real Madrid club statement In relation to certain information about our player Thibaut Courtois, Real Madrid wants to state the following: 1. That our player has never been diagnosed with an alleged anxiety picture and therefore, that information is absolutely false. 2. That Thibaut Courtois has been diagnosed and treated for acute gastroenteritis with dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, which made it impossible to end last Tuesday\u2019s game against Bruges. 3. The player currently responds favorably to the treatment. Silva charge insufficient when so much racism is not tackled \u201cThe FA charge of Bernardo Silva looks like a token gesture compared with the weak punishments of public racism in other areas of the game,\u201d writes Eni Aluko, who says the Football Association need to do more. Quiz! Quiz! Quiz! Test your knowledge of What Former Liverpool Managers Did Next. Your quizmaster: Jack Perry. Steve Bruce speaks Already under pressure before his side\u2019s humiliation at the hands of Leicester City last weekend, Steve Bruce was even less popular with Newcastle fans afterwards. While his team were dreadful at the King Power Stadium, they may fancy their chances against a similarly out-of-sorts Manchester United at St James\u2019s Park on Sunday. \u201cMud has been thrown my way since I walked through the door,\u201d said Bruce at his pre-match press conference. \u201cThat isn\u2019t going to change. The only thing that can change it for me is results and I\u2019m determined to make it, if I possibly can, to turn it around and take the club forward. \u201cThat\u2019s been my remit since I walked through the door. Since I arrived here two or three months ago, that\u2019s been the case, so it only heightens it.\u201d The Rumour Mill Harry Kane may head for pastures new come season\u2019s end and Manchester United want the moon on a stick. Rob Smyth flicks through the newspapers and tells us very little we didn\u2019t already know. Young Boys 2-1 Rangers Europa League: Steven Gerrard was left ruing the absence of VAR after Rangers lost by the odd goal of three at the Stade de Suisse. Celtic 2-0 CFR Cluj Europa League: Celtic finally emerged victorious after finding themselves knee-deep in Cluj for the third time this season. Ewan Murray reports from Celtic Park ... Europa League: Hector Bellerin wore the captain\u2019s armband and Gabriel Martinelli scored twice as Arsenal tore Standard Liege a new one at the Emirates. Sachin Nakrani was there ... Europa League: Willy Boly left it extremely late to snatch victory for Wolves in Istanbul. Paul Doyle was at Vodafone Park. Europa League: Manchester United failed to muster a single shot on target throughout a dismal performance against Dutch side AZ Almaar. Paul Wilson was there ... Once more unto the breach, for another weekend of league action ahead of the imminent international break. Ahead of the weekend\u2019s fun, we\u2019ll bring you football news from around the UK and beyond as it unravels. Whether it\u2019s team news, the latest luke-warm takes from managerial press conferences, Europa League fall-out or anything else, stay tuned.",

Jeff Mason, Reuters\u2019 White House correspondent, put that query to Trump at a press conference this week to mark a visit by the Finnish president, Sauli Niinist\u00f6. Trump was evasive then, when Mason politely persevered, suddenly turned nasty. \u201cAre you talking to me?\u201d Trump snarled, as though challenging Mason to a bar brawl. \u201cDid you hear me?

Modern life cannot stimulate the bittersweet tingle we feel as we wistfully recall the bad times and the worse of our glory days. We\u2019ve even developed a formula for true happiness: Nostalgia = Misery + Time. The same will be true, to some extent, when Brendan Rodgers returns to Anfield. We\u2019ll all remember the good times: the SSS strike force and that astonishing surge to within one sure footing of the Premier League title in 2013-14. The bad \u2013 picking a reserve team at the Bernab\u00e9u, losing 6-1 at Stoke, pretty much everything from the summer of 2014 onwards \u2013 will be washed away by goodwill.</p> <p>Liverpool and Rodgers have both moved on to happier places. Liverpool are champions of Europe; Rodgers has a brilliant young team that lies top of the Premier League\u2019s Second Division. He also has another chance to make history at Anfield on Saturday, this time by ending Liverpool\u2019s run of 16 straight wins, which is just two short of Manchester\u2019s City\u2019s record for consecutive victories in the most competitive league in the world. A sporadically ludicrous man, Rodgers\u2019 apparent self-regard and predilection for business speak sometimes obscure the fact he might be the finest British coach around. His Leicester are third in the table \u2013 both this season, and in the form table since Rodgers took over.

      "bodyText": "STEADY The Fiver has always enjoyed revisiting old haunts, injunctions permitting. Modern life cannot stimulate the bittersweet tingle we feel as we wistfully recall the bad times and the worse of our glory days. We\u2019ve even developed a formula for true happiness: Nostalgia = Misery + Time. The same will be true, to some extent, when Brendan Rodgers returns to Anfield. We\u2019ll all remember the good times: the SSS strike force and that astonishing surge to within one sure footing of the Premier League title in 2013-14. The bad \u2013 picking a reserve team at the Bernab\u00e9u, losing 6-1 at Stoke, pretty much everything from the summer of 2014 onwards \u2013 will be washed away by goodwill. Liverpool and Rodgers have both moved on to happier places. Liverpool are champions of Europe; Rodgers has a brilliant young team that lies top of the Premier League\u2019s Second Division. He also has another chance to make history at Anfield on Saturday, this time by ending Liverpool\u2019s run of 16 straight wins, which is just two short of Manchester\u2019s City\u2019s record for consecutive victories in the most competitive league in the world. A sporadically ludicrous man, Rodgers\u2019 apparent self-regard and predilection for business speak sometimes obscure the fact he might be the finest British coach around. His Leicester are third in the table \u2013 both this season, and in the form table since Rodgers took over. Their brat-pack of future stars will not be intimidated by some This is Anfield sign, though they might think it looks particularly totes Stegosaurus. Rodgers doesn\u2019t play by \u201cthe rules\u201d of management. You can\u2019t change a winning team? He\u2019ll change one that just won 5-0 by bringing in the fit-again James Maddison. Liverpool, meanwhile, will be without Jo\u00ebl Matip, but goalkeeper Alisson might be fit to return. Their complacent 4-3 win over Salzburg was not so much a wake-up call as a fire alarm operating within the lug-hole itself, and is likely to concentrate minds before Leicester\u2019s visit. \u201cI think if we want to win we have to play better because we know Leicester, especially this season they are very strong and a very good team,\u201d said Sadio Man\u00e9, without moving his mouth or his brain. \u201cIt is a lesson for us to be on our toes in the next game. [Jamie] Vardy always scores so we have to make sure this game he will not score and we try to take all our chances \u2013 that will be the key.\u201d Man\u00e9\u2019s manager, J\u00fcrgen Klopp, was not impressed with the video of Salzburg manager Jesse Marsch\u2019s remarkable, multi-lingual half-effing-time effing team-talk at effing Anfield on Wednesday. \u201cIf LFC asked me in that situation, I would leave the club!\u201d he blabbed. \u201cThat is the truth. That is all I have say about that.\u201d Klopp did not say whether he was familiar with a previous classic of the genre: 2012\u2019s Being: Liverpool (8.6/10 on IMDb), starring a Mr B Rodgers. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cWe apologise to [our] guests from Azerbaijan. We have nothing to do with this provocation. We\u2019ll figure [it] out!\u201d \u2013 Dudelange say sorry to Qarabag after their Big Vase game was briefly suspended while a drone carrying an Armenian flag flew over the pitch. The visitors ran out 4-1 winners. RECOMMENDED LISTENING Coming in your ears, it\u2019s Football Weekly Extra! FIVER LETTERS \u201cLong time lurker, I started reading when I lived in Finland back in 2013. Which brings me to Jari Litmanen (yesterday\u2019s Fiver). It\u2019s not the mullet that worries me, it\u2019s how he still looks reasonably the same as he did when he played in the first Big Cup final I ever watched, back in 1996, on an old black and white TV. I came to the conclusion a long time ago that Litti is a vampire\u201d \u2013 Daniel Jeffery. \u201cStamp it out, Fiver. How dare you publish the England squad in detail and follow it with a mere mention of Wales (yesterday\u2019s Bits and Bobs)? As a Welsh woman born and bred but living in exile in England, I am mightily offended. I could write some nasty Welsh swear words about you here, but I will refrain\u201d \u2013 Susan Sleight. \u201cRegarding Ryan Giggs \u2018speaking to everyone involved \u2026 to make sure we were all singing from the same hymn sheet\u2019 (yesterday\u2019s Bits and Bobs). It\u2019s good to see him keeping other Welsh traditions alive besides non-qualification for tournaments\u201d \u2013 Gareth McCann. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.

The DUP itself is isolated. Most Northern Ireland voters oppose Brexit. Farmers and business executives fear no deal, or the Downing Street plan for a double border, would decimate trade. The DUP\u2019s unionist rivals cry betrayal at the prospect of divergence from the rest of the UK.</p> <p>Yet Foster, dented, chipped and demonised, is unbowed and in a position to shape history.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s resilience there,\u201d said Peter Weir, a party colleague and former education minister who has known her since they were law students. \u201cIt\u2019s perhaps unsurprising given what she\u2019s come through in her life.\u201d</p> <p>Foster was born in 1970, a year after the Troubles erupted, and grew up near the border in rural County Fermanagh where Protestants felt besieged by IRA attacks.</p> <p>She was eight years old when her father, a farmer and part-time police officer, was shot outside the family home. \u201cMy father came in on all fours crawling, with blood coming from his head,\u201d she once told the Belfast Telegraph. He survived.</p> <p>A decade later the IRA blew up her school bus in an attempt to kill the driver, a part-time soldier. The girl seated beside Foster was seriously injured. \u201cThose experiences shaped and soured her to an extent, which is inevitable,\u201d said Tonge.</p> <p>Foster became a solicitor and joined the Ulster Unionist party (UUP) but opposed the leadership\u2019s endorsement of the 1998 Good Friday agreement, deeming it soft on the IRA. In 2004, an elected assembly member, she defected to the harder-line DUP.</p> <p>When Ian Paisley led the party into government with Sinn F\u00e9in in 2007 Foster, married with three children, swiftly rose through the ranks, serving as minister for the environment, then enterprise, then finance before taking over from Peter Robinson as party leader and first minister in 2015.</p> <p>Young, female, Church of Ireland rather than Free Presbyterian, a fan of EastEnders and Strictly Come Dancing, by DUP standards Foster seemed modern and cuddly. \u201cShe\u2019s a very warm individual \u2013 very down to earth with the public. She has a good heart,\u201d said Weir.</p> <p>Friends say she is socially pragmatic and no homophobe, but Foster has played to her party\u2019s base by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/09/from-climate-denial-to-abortion-heres-six-dup-policies-you-should-know-about\">opposing marriage equality</a> and abortion liberalisation.</p> <p>The bigger surprise, say critics, was incompetence and clumsiness.</p> <p>Under Foster\u2019s watch, a botched renewable heat incentive (RHI) scheme allowed farmers and DUP cronies to claim subsidies for heating empty barns, an arcane-sounding scandal that span out of control and spawned a public inquiry that exposed deep dysfunction in Stormont.</p> <p>\u201cThe cash-for-ash scandal has exposed Foster\u2019s judgment in multiple areas,\u201d said Sam McBride, a journalist and author of a forthcoming book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Burned-Cash-Ash-Northern-Secretive/dp/1785372696\">Burned</a>, which details Foster\u2019s central role in the saga.</p> <p>It quotes one senior public servant who accuses her of obsessing over PR photos and neglecting strategy.</p> <p>McBride said: \u201cFoster can be disarmingly and effectively direct \u2026 but she also has a fierce temper and hates admitting mistakes to the point where it undermines her as a leader.\u201d The pending RHI inquiry report is expected to lay this bare.</p> <p>Foster\u2019s stubbornness contributed to Sinn F\u00e9in quitting Stormont in 2017, collapsing power sharing and creating a vacuum just as Northern Ireland confronted existential questions. Polarisation deepened when Foster compared Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s demand for an Irish language act to an insatiable crocodile, a gaffe that emboldened calls for a united Ireland.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/04/jeremy-corbyn-mps-labour-leader-legitimacy\">For those who want to stop no deal, Jeremy Corbyn is the only hope | Gary Younge</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Northern Ireland will soon pass a thousand days without government, a milestone that undermines the credibility of a Brexit plan that would give the zombified Stormont a veto over trading arrangements.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s tenacious but lacks political dexterity,\u201d said Tonge. \u201cIn terms of advancing political stability in Northern Ireland, the Foster years have been a failure.\u201d</p> <p>It is hardly all Foster\u2019s fault. Sinn F\u00e9in won\u2019t return to Stormont. Civil service machinery is wonky. The DUP\u2019s 10 Westminster MPs, led by Nigel Dodds, decide Brexit tactics. The Conservative party is melting and the Irish government won\u2019t soften the backstop.</p> <p>But as Northern Ireland swerves from fiasco to fiasco, putting its economy, stability and very existence in doubt, it is Arlene Foster holding the reins.</p>",

If the prime minister\u2019s proposal dies in Dublin and Brussels, triggering a constitutional crisis, a no-deal exit or toxic election, or perhaps all three, there will be a \u201cblood red\u201d trickle leading to Foster. \u201cThere cannot be a border down the Irish Sea, a differential between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK,\u201d she declared last year. \u201cThe red line is blood red.\u201d The blood turns out to be diluted with ketchup because the DUP this week accepted Johnson\u2019s plan that Northern Ireland stays in the EU\u2019s single market for goods while the whole of the UK leaves the EU\u2019s customs territory. The plan may win Westminster support but has received a frosty response in Brussels and Dublin because it would require customs checks on the island of Ireland \u2013 a hard border \u2013 and grant a veto to the Stormont assembly. Whatever happens next, this much is clear: Arlene Foster\u2019s words will be closely studied, from Watford to Warsaw. \u201cShe is one of the most important politicians in Europe at the moment,\u201d said Jon Tonge, a University of Liverpool academic and co-author of a book about the DUP. The paradox is that Foster, 49, has never been weaker. She is isolated within her party, which reportedly wants to dump her. The DUP itself is isolated. Most Northern Ireland voters oppose Brexit. Farmers and business executives fear no deal, or the Downing Street plan for a double border, would decimate trade. The DUP\u2019s unionist rivals cry betrayal at the prospect of divergence from the rest of the UK. Yet Foster, dented, chipped and demonised, is unbowed and in a position to shape history. \u201cThere\u2019s resilience there,\u201d said Peter Weir, a party colleague and former education minister who has known her since they were law students. \u201cIt\u2019s perhaps unsurprising given what she\u2019s come through in her life.\u201d Foster was born in 1970, a year after the Troubles erupted, and grew up near the border in rural County Fermanagh where Protestants felt besieged by IRA attacks. She was eight years old when her father, a farmer and part-time police officer, was shot outside the family home. \u201cMy father came in on all fours crawling, with blood coming from his head,\u201d she once told the Belfast Telegraph. He survived. A decade later the IRA blew up her school bus in an attempt to kill the driver, a part-time soldier. The girl seated beside Foster was seriously injured. \u201cThose experiences shaped and soured her to an extent, which is inevitable,\u201d said Tonge. Foster became a solicitor and joined the Ulster Unionist party (UUP) but opposed the leadership\u2019s endorsement of the 1998 Good Friday agreement, deeming it soft on the IRA. In 2004, an elected assembly member, she defected to the harder-line DUP. When Ian Paisley led the party into government with Sinn F\u00e9in in 2007 Foster, married with three children, swiftly rose through the ranks, serving as minister for the environment, then enterprise, then finance before taking over from Peter Robinson as party leader and first minister in 2015. Young, female, Church of Ireland rather than Free Presbyterian, a fan of EastEnders and Strictly Come Dancing, by DUP standards Foster seemed modern and cuddly. \u201cShe\u2019s a very warm individual \u2013 very down to earth with the public. She has a good heart,\u201d said Weir. Friends say she is socially pragmatic and no homophobe, but Foster has played to her party\u2019s base by opposing marriage equality and abortion liberalisation. The bigger surprise, say critics, was incompetence and clumsiness. Under Foster\u2019s watch, a botched renewable heat incentive (RHI) scheme allowed farmers and DUP cronies to claim subsidies for heating empty barns, an arcane-sounding scandal that span out of control and spawned a public inquiry that exposed deep dysfunction in Stormont. \u201cThe cash-for-ash scandal has exposed Foster\u2019s judgment in multiple areas,\u201d said Sam McBride, a journalist and author of a forthcoming book, Burned, which details Foster\u2019s central role in the saga. It quotes one senior public servant who accuses her of obsessing over PR photos and neglecting strategy. McBride said: \u201cFoster can be disarmingly and effectively direct \u2026 but she also has a fierce temper and hates admitting mistakes to the point where it undermines her as a leader.\u201d The pending RHI inquiry report is expected to lay this bare. Foster\u2019s stubbornness contributed to Sinn F\u00e9in quitting Stormont in 2017, collapsing power sharing and creating a vacuum just as Northern Ireland confronted existential questions. Polarisation deepened when Foster compared Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s demand for an Irish language act to an insatiable crocodile, a gaffe that emboldened calls for a united Ireland. Northern Ireland will soon pass a thousand days without government, a milestone that undermines the credibility of a Brexit plan that would give the zombified Stormont a veto over trading arrangements. \u201cShe\u2019s tenacious but lacks political dexterity,\u201d said Tonge. \u201cIn terms of advancing political stability in Northern Ireland, the Foster years have been a failure.\u201d It is hardly all Foster\u2019s fault. Sinn F\u00e9in won\u2019t return to Stormont. Civil service machinery is wonky. The DUP\u2019s 10 Westminster MPs, led by Nigel Dodds, decide Brexit tactics. The Conservative party is melting and the Irish government won\u2019t soften the backstop. But as Northern Ireland swerves from fiasco to fiasco, putting its economy, stability and very existence in doubt, it is Arlene Foster holding the reins.",

Separately, Johan Lundgren, the chief executive of easyJet, said the company was looking at Thomas Cook\u2019s assets. \u201cOf course, like all airlines and tour operators, we will look at what might be of interest to us from the Thomas Cook network,\u201d he told the German newspaper Die Welt. \u201cBut there is no decision yet.\u201d Before its collapse last month, Thomas Cook received seven non-binding offers for parts of its business \u2013 its airline operation, tour operator and Nordic business \u2013 which were all rejected by its board and lenders. On Tuesday, Michael O\u2019Leary, the boss of Ryanair, criticised the CAA for awarding Thomas Cook a \u201cfit to fly\u201d licence for another year, months before its collapse. In the wake of the Thomas Cook debacle, O\u2019Leary, who praised the CAA for the planning and handling of Operation Matterhorn, made a bleak prediction for the future of the package holiday industry, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s screwed, it\u2019s over\u201d. According to the travel industry group Abta, half of UK holidaymakers took a package holiday last year, a figure that has held steady since 2014. Thomas Cook\u2019s rival Tui has fared better, with strong demand for holiday experiences. It also owns many of its hotels. Earlier this week, the Financial Reporting Council, Britain\u2019s accounting watchdog, began an investigation into EY\u2019s auditing of Thomas Cook\u2019s accounts. While thousands of holidaymakers have been waiting for the government\u2019s emergency airlift to get them home, former Thomas Cook bosses have come in for heavy criticism for pocketing payouts worth more than \u00a335m over the last 12 years. In a witness statement to the high court, Peter Fankhauser, Thomas Cook\u2019s last chief executive, revealed the stricken travel company had a balance sheet black hole of more than \u00a33.1bn before its collapse. Last month, the business, energy and industrial strategy committee of MPs announced an inquiry into the role of \u201ccorporate greed\u201d in the collapse of Thomas Cook, focusing on directors\u2019 stewardship of the company, how much they were paid and how its accounts were prepared and signed off by auditors.",

The undertaking appears to contradict the prime minister\u2019s statements on the UK leaving the EU on 31 October regardless and unattributed claims from Downing Street that he will find a way to sidestep the act. The pledge has been given in legal papers submitted to the court of session in Edinburgh after anti-Brexit campaigners began legal action to force Johnson to uphold the act\u2019s requirements. The European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act states that if Westminster does not agree to a Brexit deal by 19 October, the prime minister has to write to the EU seeking an extension to article 50 until 31 January. The UK government has refused to release copies of its submissions in this case to the media despite repeated requests by the Guardian, the BBC and other news organisation. Key excerpts of its pledge were read out instead by Aidan O\u2019Neill QC, the lawyer for the green energy millionaire Dale Vince, the SNP MP Joanna Cherry QC, and the lawyer and anti-Brexit campaigner Jolyon Maugham QC. Maugham then tweeted extracts of the document. It states the prime minister accepts \u201che is subject to the public law principle that he cannot frustrate its purpose or the purpose of its provisions. Thus he cannot act so as to prevent the letter requesting the specified extension in the act from being sent.\u201d O\u2019Neill told Lord Pentland, the judge hearing the case, that Johnson had repeatedly contradicted that position, including in the Commons on Wednesday, by insisting the UK would leave on 31 October come what may.

If the prime minister refused to do so, O\u2019Neill could return to court to ask for Johnson to be fined or jailed, he added. No 10 declined to comment. Johnson has insisted repeatedly that he will \u201cget Brexit done\u201d by 31 October. In his party conference speech on Wednesday, he said: \u201cWhat leavers want, what remainers want, what the whole world wants is to be calmly and sensibly done with the subject, and to move on: and that is why we are coming out of the EU on 31 October, come what may\u201d.

Steve Baker, chair of the European Research Group, appeared to suggest on Friday that he had been reassured the government still intended to leave on 31 October, come what may. \u201cAll this means is that government will obey the law,\u201d he wrote. The UK government\u2019s lawyer, Andrew Webster QC, argued that no order by the courts was necessary because the prime minister had already issued a clear undertaking to the court he would obey the Benn act\u2019s provisions. Claiming it would undermine the government\u2019s negotiations with the EU to have its hands bound by the courts, Webster said: \u201cWhat we have here is a clear statement made on behalf of the prime minister and on behalf of the government as to what he will do in respect of the requirements of the 2019 act.

[The] prime minister will comply with the law.\u201d But O\u2019Neill quoted statements from a Downing Street source in a BBC story which O\u2019Neill said directly contradicted Webster\u2019s promises and proved why an interdict \u2013 an injunction to prevent to prevent Johnson breaching the Benn act \u2013 was needed. The BBC source said the Benn act\u2019s \u201cvery specific narrow duty\u201d did not prevent the government from \u201cother communications, private and public\u201d which, O\u2019Neill said, would thwart the act\u2019s duties to seek an extension to article 50 after 19 October. The BBC source said \u201cthe government is making its true position on delay known privately in Europe and this will become public soon.\u201d O\u2019Neill told the court this was proof of the government\u2019s \u201cspin, misunderstanding and misinterpretation\u201d of the act.

Facial recognition technology maps faces in crowds and compares them to images of people on a watchlist, which can include suspects, missing people and persons of interest to the police. The cameras can scan faces in large crowds in public places such as streets, shopping centres and football crowds. Last month, the high court ruled that the use of facial recognition software by South Wales police was legal after an office worker had brought a legal action saying the technology harvested too many images of innocent people. But there have been concerns about the regulatory framework governing facial recognition and its effectiveness, with studies suggesting it is less effective at accurately distinguishing black people. Khan has called for new legislation to regulate the technology. The Met report said Camden police agreed in 2016 to supply images of individuals who had been \u201carrested and charged, cautioned or reprimanded or given a formal warning\u201d to King\u2019s Cross between May 2016 and March 2018. The idea was to help the property company \u201cto discharge its responsibilities to prevent and detect crime\u201d, although it was not further explained how this would be carried out or whether the software was used. That prompted Murray to ask whether the police could be confident that the image sharing was legitimate. \u201cThe grounds on which information was shared - to prevent and detect crime \u2013 are overly broad, and really run the risk of arbitrary interfaces with individuals\u2019 rights,\u201d the lecturer said. No records were kept of whether the facial recognition software successfully recognised any of the seven people whose images were passed on, the Met admitted in the four-page report, or whether any police action followed a match. Officers in Camden nevertheless came to a new data-sharing agreement with King\u2019s Cross in early 2019, which would have governed any future use of the surveillance technology. King\u2019s Cross is owned by a consortium comprising the property developer Argent, Hermes Investment Management on behalf of BT Pensioners, and the Australian pension scheme AustralianSuper.",

      "bodyText": "After a week of turbulence on global stock markets, a something-for-everyone US jobs report appears to have calmed investor nerves. Wall Street\u2019s main stock indices enjoyed middling increases of about 0.5% in morning trading. The FTSE 100 has gained more than 1% as traders approach the end of the London trading day \u2013 although that may have been boosted by a move lower in sterling. The pound had lost 0.4% against the euro and the US dollar at the time of writing. The overall outlook for the US economy remains weaker, most economists agree, but investors slightly reined back their bets on the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates. The market-implied probability of a rate cut from the Fed in October moved from 86.5% on Thursday to 76% early on Friday afternoon. Hinesh Patel, portfolio manager at Quilter Investors, said: The market took a sigh of relief following the US jobs data published today. The payroll numbers were not the disaster that had been foreshadowed by the Institute of Supply Management surveys, at least not yet. The overall outlook is still weak \u2013 but this seems purely sentiment driven rather than a focus on the fundamentals. For now the hard employment data shows there is resilience in the US economy. Florian Ielpo, head of macroeconomic research at Unigestion, said that the Fed is right to be signalling a slower pace of cuts than the markets appear to be looking for. Ielpo said: For the moment, we disagree with the ambient pessimism. The lower ISM numbers led markets to fear an upcoming recession, we do not expect it for the next two quarters. The lower unemployment rate is a tell that the macro situation in the US is closer to what the Fed expects it to be than what markets are thinking. Trade talks next week will probably be the next big global markets driver, according to Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com. He said: As for the Fed, this report doesn\u2019t really shift the needle too much \u2013 not so hot to force a rethink on cuts, but not a disaster that could ramp expectations for more aggressive easing. From this week\u2019s data you simply have to come to the conclusion that US growth has markedly slowed but far from slumping into a recession yet. Thank you for following our coverage of business, economics and markets. Please do join Graeme Wearden on Monday. JJ The main US benchmark indices have all risen as expected at Wall Street\u2019s opening bell: the Nasdaq led with a 0.4% gain, while the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&amp;P 500 rose by 0.3% apiece. Apple shares were a big driver of gains thanks to reports in the Nikkei Asian Review that suppliers have been asked to increase production of the iPhone 11 by as much as 10%. Apple shares gained 2%. US stock market futures are indicating gentle increases are in store at the opening bell on Wall Street. The S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average are both set to gain 0.2%, while the Nasdaq should gain 0.3%. The jobs data have boosted the US dollar against its main trading pairs \u2013 it is up by 0.1% for the day. However, the fact that sterling has fallen against both the euro and the dollar might suggest that Brexit updates may adding to the pressure on the pound. It is down by 0.3% against the euro, and 0.2% against the US dollar. Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China may be making its mark on the global economy (and particularly on manufacturers who pay tariffs), but the jobs report suggests the US economy is not quite in the doldrums. Non-farm payrolls data for August were also revised up, with 168,000 jobs created rather than the 130,000 previously reported. Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, said: The 136,000 increase in non-farm payrolls in September illustrates that while growth in employment (and broader activity) has slowed, it is not collapsing. Manufacturing employment fell by only 2,000, which is surprisingly resilient given the slump in the ISM manufacturing index. Retail employment fell by 11,400, but that reflects structural change rather than cyclical weakness. There is something for everyone in the jobs numbers. Donald Trump, the US president, is clearly happy with the unemployment number. Unemployment has fallen to 3.5%, its lowest since December 1969, and below economists\u2019 expectations of 3.7%. However, average hourly earnings rose by 2.9% from a year earlier, below the 3.2% consensus. That \u2013 along with the lower-than-expected headline jobs number \u2013 might suggest that the unemployment rate is unsustainable. That could support calls for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in anticipation of a slowdown. The US unemployment rate fell to 3.5% in September, the lowest since 1969. US stock market futures have risen slightly in the immediate aftermath of the jobs report. The FTSE 100 has also gained \u2013 it\u2019s now up by 0.6% for the day. US non-farm payrolls data came in slightly lower than expected, at 136,000 new jobs in September, below the 145,000 average expectation. The market-implied probability of an interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve on 30 October is 85%, according to CME Group\u2019s handy Fedwatch tool (which is based on investors\u2019 interest rate bets). That means investors on average do not think that a rate cut is a certainty this month \u2013 but it is still thought of as the more likely outcome. Analysts at Deutsche Bank led by Jim Reid said: We haven\u2019t quite got a full cut priced in but clearly we\u2019ve seen a big step change in expectations this week given the data, and even an in-line payrolls reading today shouldn\u2019t do much to change the narrative. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell will have the chance to address the data at 7pm BST tonight when he makes some remarks at an event. The effect of non-farm payrolls on assets may be tricky to work out at first glance. John Velis, an FX and macro strategist at US investment bank BNY Mellon, said: There is a lot riding on Friday\u2019s job market report; if it disappoints \u2013 while it might increase the odds of policy easing into the end of the year \u2013 risky asset markets might finally begin to price in the prospects of more than a mild slowdown in the US economy, and bring asset prices down with them. The employment components of the closely followed purchasing managers\u2019 index surveys by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) both fell in data published this week, he added. Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, predicted a stronger September reading, but said the trend would be closer to a 50,000 monthly reading by the end of the year. He said: The trade war is the story here, with manufacturing already in recession and the services sector now extremely nervous over the impact of tariffs on consumer goods. So far, the threat to business has not triggered any increase in layoffs, but it\u2019s just a matter of time. The dollar could weaken if the jobs number surprises on the downside, according to Han Tan, a market analyst at FXTM, a foreign exchange trading firm. The greenback is about flat for the day against a trade-weighted basket of currencies. The US jobs report is one of the most widely anticipated economic data releases every month. The report\u2019s significance this month has been heightened by a run of weaker data from the world\u2019s largest economy. Here are some pointers on what to expect: The crucial non-farm payrolls number shows how many jobs have been created across the US economy (excluding very seasonal changes in farming jobs). Economists on average predict that 145,000 jobs were created in September, up from 130,000 in August. A significantly lower reading could prompt fears that job creation has slowed, reflecting slower growth across the economy. On the other hand, weaker data could also prompt the Federal Reserve to step up its stimulus efforts more quickly. US stock markets rose on Thursday after worse than expected services data. The rate of unemployment is expected to stay at 3.7%, near the lowest levels since the 1970s. Helena Morrissey, one of the UK\u2019s few prominent female investors, has stepped down from her job at Legal &amp; General Investment Management. \u201cI see a changing Britain and have a lot of ideas and other things that I want to achieve,\u201d Morrissey said, according to Reuters. Morrissey joined LGIM in 2017. She has reportedly been interviewed to replace Mark Carney as governor of the Bank of England. Documents submitted to the Scottish court in the case to force an extension of the Article 50 Brexit negotiation period promise that the government will send a letter to the EU doing so \u201cno later than 19 October\u201d if there is no withdrawal deal. The government did not publish its legal arguments in the case, but the barrister for the campaigners bringing the case has read them out in court. The people bringing the case want to ensure there is no way the government can back out of their legal obligations, which could lead to the UK leaving without a deal. The Guardian\u2019s Scotland editor, Severin Carrell, is there. He tweeted: Oil prices have risen on Friday, but the outlook continues to be dominated by investor concerns over weakening demand. Brent crude futures prices gained 0.7% to more than $58 per barrel. However, that remained below the $60 mark at the start of the week, putting the North Sea benchmark on track for its second week of losses. Poorer macroeconomic data has weighed on prices, despite increases in Saudi prices in the wake of attacks on key facilities last month which caused a spike in global crude prices, according to Warren Patterson and Wenyu Yao, commodity strategists at ING Economics. The government\u2019s road to net zero carbon emissions by 2050 depends on battery electric cars replacing petrol and diesel almost entirely. There\u2019s a problem though: fossil fuels will leave big hole in the public finances. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has been looking at the problem, writes Guardian economics editor Larry Elliott. Britain should move to a system of road pricing to combat congestion and compensate for the \u00a328bn loss of revenue from fuel duty as the country makes the transition to electric vehicles, the IFS has said. The thinktank said the government\u2019s pledge that the UK would reach zero net emissions by 2050 meant the tax take from petrol and diesel would shrink to nothing over the coming decades and a new way to raise money from drivers was needed. You can read more about the delicate transition (and the enormous subsidies given to fossil fuels at the moment) here: It\u2019s all quiet on the sterling front this morning \u2013 the pound is just about flat against the euro and the US dollar \u2013 as politicians set the groundwork for crunch negotiations on a withdrawal agreement. Here\u2019s a roundup of the Brexit news today. Boris Johnson is set to launch a whirlwind round of talks in European Union capitals as he tries to sell his new Brexit withdrawal agreement proposals to leaders. Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney this morning said that the government\u2019s proposals on Brexit are a step forward, but that more changes are needed. He raised concerns about the Northern Irish assembly\u2019s ability to veto trade arrangements. A German government spokesman said proposals must protect the European Union\u2019s internal market and avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Home Office minister Brandon Lewis told the Today programme this morning that the proposals on a renegotiated withdrawal agreement are a \u201cfinal offer\u201d. He said: From our point of view it\u2019s a final offer. But we are open and understand the fact that the EU may come back and say \u2018Look, this deal is fine, but can we just look at this...?\u2019 and we\u2019ll have to look at that when we get to that point. But I\u2019ve got to say, to be frank, as the prime minister said, this is our clear final deal. We think it\u2019s a good deal, it\u2019s a fair deal, it delivers both legally and security-wise for both our country here in the UK and obviously our friends in Europe. The court of session \u2013 Scotland\u2019s highest civil court \u2013 will hear the first arguments about whether Boris Johnson can be forced to extend article 50. The ruling is due on Monday. And Rory Stewart is not leaving politics. Shortly after announcing his resignation as a Tory MP he has revealed he will stand as an independent candidate for London mayor. The news will come as a blow to Tory candidate Shaun Bailey. Easyjet is considering snapping up assets from the collapsed travel operator Thomas Cook. In an interview with German newspaper Die Welt, Easyjet chief executive Johan Lundgren said: Of course, like all airlines and tour operators, we will look at what might be of interest to us from the Thomas Cook network. But there is no decision yet. Shares on Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index fell by 1.1% on Friday amid continued political turmoil. Hong Kong\u2019s leader, Carrie Lam, plans to use harsh colonial-era emergency powers for the first time, banning face masks in a bid to curb the city\u2019s protests. Many protestors wear masks to hide their identities in case they lose their jobs, but the use of surgical masks has also been widespread for decades after outbreaks of illness. Reuters reported: Lam, speaking at a news conference, said a ban on face masks would take effect on Saturday under the emergency laws that allow authorities to \u201cmake any regulations whatsoever\u201d in whatever they deem to be in the public interest. A mid-morning update on trading in London: the FTSE 100 has gained 0.4%, in part thanks to higher oil prices helping the weighty drilling contingent. However, the FTSE is still on track for its worst week in more than a year and a half unless things pick up considerably in the next few hours. The mid-cap FTSE 250 has gained 0.1%. It was a similar story across Europe: after a bumpy week there have been moderate gains in the Euro Stoxx 600 index, although benchmark indices in Germany and France have only edged up. Some more detail on the car registrations figures. There are a few moving parts, but essentially it is not a very bright outlook for the sector. Ian Plummer, director at Auto Trader, warned to expect some jiggery-pokery around registrations data as carmakers try to prop up the numbers amid the Brexit-related downturn. As they focus on hitting their annual targets, both manufacturers and retailers have been using tactics \u2013 such as self-registrations \u2013 to artificially buoy the numbers and overstate the natural level of demand for new cars, because they just aren\u2019t seeing the consumer demand to reach the figures they need to organically. This push activity will almost certainly continue next month ahead of the Brexit deadline, as the industry prepares for whatever the 31st has in store. And more complications could come further down the line as carbon dioxide reduction targets mean that selling lower-emission diesels will be more attractive. One small problem: consumers have turned away from diesels in their droves after scandals over emissions of nitrogen oxides. Diesel sales this year are down by a fifth. One piece of good news: battery electric vehicles have more than doubled this year, and sales look to have accelerated recently. There is still a long way to go before they take a significant chunk out of petrol\u2019s market share. Some analysis on the SMMT car sales data from Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club forecasters: It has been fairly quiet on the Brexit front so far this morning \u2013 give them time \u2013 but here is one of the things that will drive the day in Westminster: one-time Conservative leadership contender Rory Stewart plans to resign. Stewart said he will stand down at the next general election after resigning from the Conservative party. The Guardian\u2019s Peter Walker writes: He announced his resignation in front of an audience of thousands on Thursday night at an event where he read out a letter in which an Eton housemaster described Boris Johnson as being guilty of \u201ca gross failure of responsibility\u201d. This morning he then tweeted to confirm the news. You can read the full story here: British car sales rose less than hoped in September, with the industry body blaming Brexit uncertainty. Sales rose by only 1.3% year-on-year in September, according to the Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). That meant that year-to-date sales are still down by 2.5%. New car registrations slumped by a fifth in September 2018 because of the introduction new emissions regulations and the subsequent lack of testing capacity across Europe. That should have set up this September for a healthy increase. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT, said: September\u2019s modest growth belies the ongoing downward trend we\u2019ve seen over the past 30 months. We expected to see a more significant increase in September, similar to those seen in France, Germany, Italy and Spain, given the negative effect WLTP [the new testing regime] had on all European markets last year. Instead, consumer confidence is being undermined by political and economic uncertainty. We need to restore stability to the market which means avoiding a \u2018no deal\u2019 Brexit and, moreover, agreeing a future relationship with the EU that avoids tariffs and barriers that could increase prices and reduce buyer choice. Here\u2019s some more detail on the Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s proposed crackdown on uncompetitive insurance firms. Insurance company shares on the FTSE 100 have edged down following the announcement. Six million home and motor insurance policy holders are overpaying a combined \u00a31.2bn in premiums a year because insurance firms are not giving good deals to loyal customers, writes the Guardian\u2019s Mark Sweney. The FCA found widespread evidence of a so-called \u201cloyalty penalty\u201d whereby long-standing customers are effectively penalised for sticking with their contracts. The report identifies a range of tactics being used by insurers including selling policies at a discount to new customers and boosting premiums when they renew, specifically targeting increases at those less likely to switch to a new provider for a better deal. Potential remedies could include: Banning or restricting practices like raising prices for consumers who renew year on year or requiring firms to automatically move consumers to cheaper equivalent deals. Stopping practices that could discourage switching. Making firms publish information about price differentials between their customers. You can read the full story here: Bob Dudley\u2019s replacement, Bernard Looney, has run BP\u2019s oil exploration operations since April 2016, after a career at BP which started as a drilling engineer in 1991. BP chairman Helge Lund said Looney has \u201call the right qualities to lead us through this transformational era\u201d of the \u201cenergy transition\u201d. BP said Looney has driven \u201csustainable emissions reductions of almost 3 million tonnes CO2 equivalent in the past two years\u201d. However, he has also expanded oil drilling into new countries, and he has been responsible for extracting more than 2.6 million barrels equivalent of oil and gas a day. Looney, an Irishman, will earn \u00a31.3m a year in annual salary, plus the chance of a maximum annual bonus (including any deferral) of up to 225% of that salary. BP shares have gained 0.5% after the news of succession at the top. Bob Dudley will step down from the oil supermajor after its annual results on 4 February, and he will retire completely on 31 March. Dudley joined Amoco Corporation in 1979, becoming general manager for strategy by 1999, when it merged with BP. He worked as group vice president for BP\u2019s renewables and alternative energy activities, before becoming responsible for BP\u2019s exploration businesses in Russia, the Caspian region, Angola, Algeria and Egypt. From 2003 to 2008 he was president and chief executive officer of TNK-BP, a joint venture in Russia that was highly profitable but ended in acrimony. He returned to BP in 2009, but in 2010 he was thrust into the top position following the Deepwater Horizon disaster, in which a damaged rig spewed oil into the Gulf of Mexico. Since then he has faced criticism over high pay even when the company lost money and the environment, amid an emerging consensus that an expanding oil sector is not compatible with limiting global heating. He provoked laughter last year at an industry conference when he rejected calls for divestment from fossil fuels. Campaigners have described his plans to limit operational emissions as \u201cgreenwashing\u201d. John Lewis is looking for discounts from landlords amid struggles for the department store chain which pushed it to a loss for the first half of the year for the first time, according to the BBC. Here are details from the report: The BBC has learned that the retail giant has been telling landlords in some locations that it will withhold 20% of this quarter\u2019s service charge. These are the fees retailers pay on top of rent for services such as heating and security. John Lewis said it had faced increased service fees at a time when it is trying to cut costs. Its statement said: Over the last three years we have seen an increase in service charges of 20% and these continued increases are simply not acceptable, particularly in the absence of strenuous efforts by landlords to work collaboratively with us to reduce these costs. The FTSE 100 has gained 0.2% at the open \u2013 after three days of falling. There are currently no stocks on London\u2019s blue-chip index that have moved by more than 2% in either direction. Germany\u2019s Dax 100 gained 0.1% (after a national holiday yesterday) and France\u2019s Cac 40 gained 0.2%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, economics and markets. Investors across the world have endured a choppy week, as feeble economic data has taken many off guard. Today we have arguably the biggest of the lot store: the US jobs report. Asian stock markets were mixed on Friday, but investors appeared to have taken some heart from gains last night on Wall Street. The S&amp;P 500 had slumped by more than 1% on both Tuesday and Wednesday, and it looked set for more pain yesterday after disappointing US services data. However, the benchmark stock index ended the day up by 0.8%, reflecting in part traders\u2019 hopes that the Federal Reserve will ride to rescue the US economy if it falters. All eyes will be on the non-farm payrolls report, at 1:30pm BST, to see if the economic fears reflected in some of yesterday\u2019s survey data have carried through to the jobs market. The US economy added 130,000 jobs in August, lower than the 158,000 predicted by economists beforehand. In UK corporate news, BP boss Bob Dudley will retire on 31 March 2020, after 40 years with the oil supermajor, including nine as chief executive. Bernard Looney, 49, currently chief executive of BP\u2019s upstream division, will take over. The appointment of Looney, in charge of the company\u2019s search for new oil reserves, comes at a time when BP faces immense political pressure to wind down fossil fuel extraction to avoid exacerbating the climate crisis. And the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the UK\u2019s financial regulator, has warned the insurance market that it may have to ban some unfair pricing practices including automatic price rises. The FCA has particularly highlighted uncompetitive practices that harm the most loyal customers, who often pay much more than those who switch. The FCA said: Insurers often sell policies at a discount to new customers and increase premiums when customers renew, targeting increases at those less likely to switch.

investigated the false allegations of sex abuse by Westminster VIPs also sheds light on the extent of the role of Labour\u2019s deputy leader, <strong>Tom Watson</strong>, who met Beech and encouraged him to go to the police with his claims.</p> \n  <p>The retired high court judge Sir <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Richard Henriques</strong> said in his report that Watson\u2019s intervention over a separate 1967 rape allegation against Brittan left officers \u201cin a state of panic\u201d, and that he \u201cgrossly insulted\u201d Brittan. </p> \n  <p>He said the Met was wrong to subject Brittan to an interview over the rape claim, and ignored the view of one of its senior detectives that there was no case to answer, as <strong>Simon Murphy</strong> and <strong>Vikram Dodd </strong>report.</p> \n  <p>Henriques wrote: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>I have concluded that the errors in this investigation were largely attributable to the fact that Lord Brittan was a prominent person and there was a desire amongst senior officers to reassure the public that if they come forward the police will investigate a complaint thoroughly no matter whom the allegation is against. </em></p> \n   <p><em>I have concluded also that investigating officers were fearful of media criticism and public cynicism and sought protection from it by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).</em></p> \n   <p><em>There can be no doubt that Tom Watson believed \u2018Nick\u2019 and it should be stated that he had previously provided the MPS with information leading to convictions in other cases. </em></p> \n   <p><em>His interest, however, in both Operation Midland and Operation Vincente created further pressure upon MPS (Metropolitan Police Service) officers.</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Steve Rodhouse</strong>, the officer in charge of Operation Midland who is now a senior director at the National Crime Agency, was referred to the police watchdog over the inquiry, but the body did not take it on as an investigation. </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>My decision-making on Operation Vincente was driven by the need to ensure that the public could have confidence that the MPS had thoroughly investigated the allegation made against Lord Brittan. </em></p> \n   <p><em>This was important in light of the many allegations that the police had historically overlooked, made against prominent public figures.</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>However, Watson has said Rodhouse has been clear that the letter did not influence the investigation, and that the ex-director of public prosecutions <strong>Alison Saunders</strong> publicly confirmed that my letter was not received by police until after the interview. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIt therefore cannot be argued that it was pressure from me that led to Lord Brittan being interviewed.\u201d <br></p> \n  <p>Our full story has now been updated:</p> \n

further technical talks with officials in Brussels which Downing Street said could go on into the weekend.</p> \n  <p>A No 10 spokeswoman said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>I

      "bodyText": "The UK government promised the highest civil court in Scotland that Boris Johnson would send a letter to the EU seeking an extension to article 50 as required by the Benn act. Lawyers acting in the case were quick to highlight the apparent contradiction between the promise and the prime minister\u2019s comments yesterday in which he reaffirmed the UK would leave the EU by 31 October. The revelation came after the government lost its bid to delay a Scottish court case on an extension to Brexit, as the PM\u2019s Europe advisor David Frost had talks in Brussels that Downing Street said could go on into the weekend. The Northern Ireland secretary suggested that the right of one party to veto Brexit arrangements in Northern Ireland may be eliminated for the purpose of the UK\u2019s departure from the EU. The Home Office minister Brandon Lewis said Johnson\u2019s Brexit proposals were the government\u2019s \u201cfinal offer\u201d and claimed there was a \u201cbuilding majority\u201d of MPs who supported the plan. The former Tory leadership candidate Rory Stewart resigned from the Conservative party and said he would stand down at the next general election, before swiftly announcing he would stand for mayor of London as an independent. Scotland Yard officers agreed to tell the media they believed \u201cNick\u201d \u2013 Carl Beech, the key witness for an ill-fated multimillion-pound investigation into an alleged Westminster VIP paedophile ring \u2013 whose claims sparked a major police operation, according to a damning new report. The former high court judge Sir Richard Henriques said a \u201cmajor contributing factor was the culture that \u2018victims\u2019 must be believed\u201d in his findings, while Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, faced renewed criticism for raising Beech\u2019s accusations in parliament. We\u2019re going to close our live blog for now. Have a nice afternoon, and thanks for all your comments. This is from PA Media. Boris Johnson\u2019s proposed replacement to the Irish border backstop mechanism is \u201cjust a palimpsest of empty words\u201d, the Westminster leader of Plaid Cymru has said. Liz Saville Roberts, the MP for Dwyfor Meirionnydd, quoted Dolly Parton\u2019s song Blue Smoke as she described the prime minister\u2019s approach to Brexit. She told the Plaid Cymru annual conference in Swansea that Johnson was ready to employ the \u201cshock tactic, deregulated free-for-all of a chaotic crash-out Brexit\u201d. \u201cWhen it comes to his Brexit policy, perhaps somewhat unexpectedly, the words of that magnificent commentator of the human condition, Dolly Parton, says it best in Blue Smoke,\u201d she told conference. \u201cMr Johnson: \u2018It hurts to know you cheated, and it hurts to know you lied, but it hurts me even worse to know you never even tried.\u2019 \u201cExcept with the DUP, of course, because the prime minister has just said he\u2019ll gift them the Brexit constitutional nuclear button every four years, while the rest of us can\u2019t be trusted with democracy and a people\u2019s vote. \u201cThis is the man who\u2019ll tell us how he\u2019s working so hard to get a deal, but that we \u2013 the little people \u2013 can\u2019t be trusted to see the non-papers, can\u2019t see the full words of warning laid out in documents with deceptively endearing names: Yellowhammer, Snow Bunting, Kingfisher and Black Swan.\u201d A palimpsest is a page of manuscript where the original text has been removed. The Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, has weighed in. As legal proceedings get back under way in Scotland, Maugham, one of those bringing the court of session legal action, has made further remarks to PA Media. It\u2019s impossible for him [Johnson] to say, as he\u2019s been telling parliament and indeed the rest of us, that we will leave the EU on October 31, come what may. That is no longer a true statement, if ever it was a true statement, of the law and the prime minister acknowledges it. It\u2019s a very sad moment that we have a prime minister who is saying two contradictory things \u2013 one to parliament and one to the courts. But in that world, in these sad circumstances, we are concerned to ensure that the prime minister does what he has told the court and does what parliament has required that he do. We want to see the courts tell him that: \u2018Unless you send the letter, no later than October 19, unless you cease trying to frustrate parliament\u2019s intention, there will be personal consequences for you, you could go to prison.\u2019 Julian Smith, the Northern Ireland secretary, has indicated that reform of the voting mechanism that could give the DUP or Sinn F\u00e9in a veto on Brexit arrangements could be \u201chelpful\u201d to get the Brexit deal across the line. Concerns have been raised by the Irish taoiseach and a number of parties in Northern Ireland that the mechanism could effectively hand the Democratic Unionist party a veto on post-Brexit arrangements. Boris Johnson\u2019s proposals for Brexit centre on a Northern Ireland-only backstop arrangement, under which the country would stay aligned to the EU\u2019s single market, but not its customs union, for five years, Lisa O\u2019Carroll reports. Leo Varadkar\u2019s intervention provides a glimmer of hope for a Brexit deal \u2013 after the Irish premier said his preference was for an agreement to be struck within the next 10 days. \u201cMy preference is that we come to an agreement and that we have a deal by the middle of October,\u201d Varadkar said during a meeting with Danish prime minister Mette Frederiksen in Copenhagen, with the taoiseach adding that if the UK were to request an extension to its Brexit deadline he would consider it. His remarks come after a fractious 24 hours that appeared to torch any chance of a deal with resistance to Boris Johnson\u2019s proposals for customs controls in Northern Ireland meeting strong resistance in Dublin and Brussels. \u201cBrexit doesn\u2019t end with the UK leaving, it\u2019s just the next phase of negotiations but if the UK were to request an extension, we would consider it, but most EU countries would only consider it for good reason, but an extension would be better than no deal,\u201d he added. On Thursday, Varadkar made comments about the shortfalls in Johnson\u2019s deal which lead to scathing attacks by the Democratic Unionist party which is supporting the Conservative party\u2019s deal. The party leader Arlene Foster said he would go down in history as the Taoiseach who prompted a hard border on the island of Ireland. SNP MP Joanna Cherry QC, one of the lawyers leading the case in Scotland, has called for \u201ca formal binding undertaking\u201d to ensure the prime minister abides by the commitments made in the court documents. Some reaction to the emergence of this document in court. Here\u2019s our full story. One tactic might mean we see more of these videos \u2013 where a toddler\u2019s first step is compared to leaving the European Union. Leo Varadkar, the Irish premier, has said that if Boris Johnson submitted a request for an extension he would agree. Brexit doesn\u2019t end with the UK leaving, it\u2019s just the next phase of negotiations but if the UK were to request an extension, we would consider it, but most EU countries would only consider it for good reason, but an extension would be better than no deal. Meanwhile, Downing Street is not commenting after the Court of Session released documents showing the prime minister accepted he would have to ask for a Brexit delay if there was no agreement by October 19. The chair of the European Research Group of staunch Brexiteers, Steve Baker, signals what approach Downing St might take to this latest twist. The court case will resume at 2pm. Here are those documents again, written in legalese, which have been released to the court. Jolyon Maugham, one of the three lawyers leading the legal case, has said Boris Johnson is \u201cplaying a very odd game\u201d and has to \u201ccome clean\u201d. What we learned today is that the prime minister has promised the court in his own name that he will ask for an extension under the Benn act if the conditions are satsifed. In other words if parliament has not before the 19th of October agreed a withdrawal agreement. He has also promised the court that he will not frustrate the Benn act, by which is meant that he will not send two letters, one saying can I have an extension and another saying don\u2019t give me one, he won\u2019t collude with foreign governments to attempt to persuade those foreign governments to veto an extension. Those are statements that he has made to the court. The court has said that in those circumstances it\u2019s contempt jurisdiction might be engaged. What the hearing is now about is whether we can push the court to clearly engage its contempt jurisdiction. Then, on Tuesday, we now know we will have a full hearing in the Inner House of the court of session, in which the Inner House will consider whether or not the prime minister refuses to do what he has today told the court that he will do, the court can sign the letter for the prime minister, the letter mandated by the Benn Act. The prime minister is playing a very odd game and its a very difficult game to understand because I think he told the House of Commons yesterday that we will leave come what may on the 31st of October, and I do not understand how that statement can be reconciled with the promises that he\u2019s made in the court today. There is no way to square that circle. And he is going to have to come clean either in parliament or the court. In the Scottish court of session, Aidan O\u2019Neill QC said the commitment within the submissions were inconsistent with what Johnson said in parliament yesterday. The government had sought to prevent these documents being released to the media, and it will raise questions over the contradiction between the prime minister\u2019s public and private stances. Government documents submitted to Scotland\u2019s highest civil court today state that the prime minister will seek a Brexit extension from the EU if no withdrawal deal is reached by 19 October. Boris Johnson said he would rather be \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d than seek a further delay, and the revelation in court appears to be in direct contradiction of that statement and throws the question of whether the UK will leave the bloc on 31 October into fresh doubt. Today\u2019s damning report on how police investigated the false allegations of sex abuse by Westminster VIPs also sheds light on the extent of the role of Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, who met Beech and encouraged him to go to the police with his claims. The retired high court judge Sir Richard Henriques said in his report that Watson\u2019s intervention over a separate 1967 rape allegation against Brittan left officers \u201cin a state of panic\u201d, and that he \u201cgrossly insulted\u201d Brittan. He said the Met was wrong to subject Brittan to an interview over the rape claim, and ignored the view of one of its senior detectives that there was no case to answer, as Simon Murphy and Vikram Dodd report. Henriques wrote: I have concluded that the errors in this investigation were largely attributable to the fact that Lord Brittan was a prominent person and there was a desire amongst senior officers to reassure the public that if they come forward the police will investigate a complaint thoroughly no matter whom the allegation is against. I have concluded also that investigating officers were fearful of media criticism and public cynicism and sought protection from it by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). There can be no doubt that Tom Watson believed \u2018Nick\u2019 and it should be stated that he had previously provided the MPS with information leading to convictions in other cases. His interest, however, in both Operation Midland and Operation Vincente created further pressure upon MPS (Metropolitan Police Service) officers. Steve Rodhouse, the officer in charge of Operation Midland who is now a senior director at the National Crime Agency, was referred to the police watchdog over the inquiry, but the body did not take it on as an investigation. My decision-making on Operation Vincente was driven by the need to ensure that the public could have confidence that the MPS had thoroughly investigated the allegation made against Lord Brittan. This was important in light of the many allegations that the police had historically overlooked, made against prominent public figures. However, Watson has said Rodhouse has been clear that the letter did not influence the investigation, and that the ex-director of public prosecutions Alison Saunders publicly confirmed that my letter was not received by police until after the interview. \u201cIt therefore cannot be argued that it was pressure from me that led to Lord Brittan being interviewed.\u201d Our full story has now been updated: As proceedings in the Scottish courts continue, the PM\u2019s Europe adviser David Frost is having further technical talks with officials in Brussels which Downing Street said could go on into the weekend. A No 10 spokeswoman said: I think it\u2019s clear that all sides want a deal. What we have done is put forward fair and reasonable proposals to help us negotiate a new deal. The [European] Commission, who obviously we will be negotiating with, welcomed our determination to advance talks and make progress towards that deal. We are ready to talk at any point, including over the weekend. Confirmation of the talks comes as the Irish deputy leader Simon Coveney said that it was clear many unionists in Northern Ireland do not support Boris Johnson\u2019s customs proposals. Lots of unionists have difficulty with that, whether it\u2019s the head of the Belfast Chamber of Commerce, the head of the Ulster Farmer\u2019s Union, the CBI, virtually every business organisation in Northern Ireland, most of them headed by unionists, let\u2019s be honest, don\u2019t think that this is a comprehensive enough proposal to ensure we maintain borderless trade on this island. On whether changes to the petition of concern could allay the Irish government\u2019s fears over the possible veto, Coveney said the matter was a domestic one, as the crux of the issue lies between the UK and EU, not Northern Ireland. We don\u2019t have an executive up and running, I wish we had, if there was a will there we could find a basis, I\u2019ve been working with the Secretary of State on that. We need to be clear here, mechanisms that are linked to cross community support in the executive are primarily about issues of competence for the executive on domestic decision-making in Northern Ireland, this is very different, this is the UK as a whole and the EU as a whole, to deal with an international border question. The idea that any one party could eventually veto the implementation of those solutions is something that the EU and the Irish Government could never accept. The issues around the Petition of Concern are important issues, but in terms of Brexit outcome and deal here, when you look at the response in Northern Ireland yesterday, there\u2019s only one party in Northern Ireland supporting Boris Johnson\u2019s proposals as the basis of deal, no one else is, because there\u2019s real problems with it, I hope the PM will recognise that and we\u2019ll see an evolution of position. On Wednesday, Irish officials described the prime minister\u2019s proposals as unworkable, unacceptable and illegal under British domestic law. However, the DUP supports the offer and Home Office minister Brandon Lewis this morning claimed support for the proposed deal was growing in parliament. The court is now hearing another case on Brexit regarding the refusal of the government to provide the media copies of the arguments comprising its legal case. Aidan O\u2019Neill QC, acting for the petitioners, said he was not seeking a court order today asking for fines or jail time if Boris Johnson does not comply, although that could happen. He said the prime minister had \u201crepeatedly\u201d threatened to thwart or ignore the Benn act. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the PM going off ad lib or a frolic of his own,\u201d he said, adding that it was clear government policy. Meanwhile, a hearing has now begun in the outer house of the court of session on whether the prime minister can be forced to extend article 50. The Guardian\u2019s Scotland editor Severin Carrell has been at the court of session\u2019s inner house \u2013 Scotland\u2019s highest civil court \u2013 covering the developments. After campaigners called for the use of an obscure power, the judge said it would be \u201cunprecedented\u201d for an official to exercise powers to sign the Article 50 extension on behalf of Boris Johnson, since the unique power of nobile officium \u2013 which would allow a court official to sign the letter \u2013 has never been used over a prime minister. Lord Drummond Young said: \u201cIn the circumstances of this case it is unprecedented. There\u2019s a question of competence.\u201d The three judges - Lord Drummond Young, Lord Menzies and Lord Turnbull - set the date for the hearing for Tuesday. Daniel Janner, the son of the late Labour MP Greville Janner, who was one of Beech\u2019s victims, has also accused the deputy Labour leader, Tom Watson, who raised the matter in parliament after speaking to Beech, of being \u201cpartially responsible\u201d. He claimed Watson \u201capplied pressure on the police and should hang his head in shame and resign\u201d. Watson, who was a backbencher at the time, said the review contained \u201cmultiple inaccuracies\u201d about him and that it did not make clear letters from him about allegations against Brittan were received by police after they had already interviewed the pper. In a statement, he said it \u201ccannot be argued that it was pressure from me that led to Lord Brittan being interviewed\u201d. He added: \u201cI have always said that it wasn\u2019t my place to judge whether sexual abuse allegations were true or false \u2013 that was for the police.\u201d Steve Rodhouse, the officer in charge of Operation Midland and Operation Vincente \u2013 an investigation into a separate rape claim against the former home secretary Leon Brittan \u2013 has issued an apology. I am sincerely sorry for the distress that has been caused to innocent people and their families as a consequence of Operation Midland and Operation Vincente. In hindsight I can see that I did not ensure that we got the balance right between our determination to maintain that confidence and our duty to robustly test the allegations being made. I understand the criticisms that have been made of my decisions during these investigations but I acted with the best of intentions throughout and I hope that I have demonstrated the transparency, honesty and integrity which have always been vital to me; my decisions were not taken lightly or without great consideration of their impact. Nevertheless, I sincerely regret the damage that the investigation caused to the reputations of those who were accused and for the hurt felt by their families. Downing Street has said the public needed to be assured that the Met had learned lessons from the case. A No 10 spokeswoman said: This is a deeply concerning case. The trial of Carl Beech raised serious issues over the Metropolitan police response. We welcome the decision to publish further detail. It is vital the public receives independent assurances that the Met has learned lessons identified in this review. That is why the home secretary has asked Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services to follow up on the report\u2019s findings and ensure the necessary improvements have been made and continue to be made. The Met\u2019s deputy commissioner, Sir Stephen House, said: The Met is determined to learn lessons from Sir Richard\u2019s review to improve our response to similar situations in the future. The Met and the officers involved cooperated fully with Sir Richard. Mistakes were made in Operation Midland and we have apologised for those. We apologise for them again today. However, we do not agree with everything Sir Richard wrote in his report or indeed all of his recent statements regarding further investigations into the actions of officers. This morning, the former Tory MP Harvey Proctor called for the Met police commissioner, Cressida Dick, to consider her position. \u201cShe showed no leadership or professional ability to insist on investigation into Beech himself,\u201d he said, accusing her of failing to amend previously inaccurate statements on the credibility of Beech\u2019s allegations. \u201cHer inaction was irresponsible and immoral and she should now consider her position.\u201d Moving away from Rory Stewart for now, it has emerged that Scotland Yard officers agreed to tell the media they believed \u201cNick\u201d, the key witness into an ill-fated multi-million pound investigation into an alleged Westminster VIP paedophile ring, whose claims sparked a major police operation. A new report reveals that revelation was omitted three years ago when the Metropolitan police released a heavily redacted version of the high court judge\u2019s report on its handling of the \u00a32.5m Operation Midland, which shut without a single arrest. Former High Court judge Sir Richard Henriques said a \u201cmajor contributing factor was the culture that \u2018victims\u2019 must be believed\u201d in his findings. The report added: Whilst the responsible officers assert that they kept an open mind, several failures can only be explained by an unwarranted and disproportionate belief in \u2018Nick\u2019s\u2019 credibility. The most significant error in this investigation was the decision to apply for search warrants coupled with formulating inaccurate statements which were placed before the district judge. But for that decision, this investigation may well have been completed without the dreadful adverse consequences I have described. The operation saw the homes of D-Day veteran Lord Edwin Bramall; Lady Diana Brittan, the widow of former home secretary Leon Brittan; and former Tory MP Harvey Proctor raided on the basis of false claims made by fantasist Carl Beech, who was jailed earlier this year for perverting the course of justice. My colleagues Simon Murphy and Vikram Dodd have the full story, which will be updated shortly. You can read the newly announced mayoral candidate\u2019s letter to Londoners in full here. Here is an excerpt: We are going to have to work together to lead London through one of the most challenging times in its history, through the uncertainty of Brexit, and in the face of an ever more divisive politics. And there is so much to do immediately. I felt this in Poplar, when I saw a man who had just been stabbed to death in a park, and when a woman in the neighbourhood led me into a public lavatory, to show me male heroin addicts shooting up in the female cubicles. I felt it in Lewisham, where some people are living with seven people in a two-room flat, and waiting three weeks for a GP appointment. I feel it through the frustration of tech entrepreneurs, struggling to plan for the future. And almost every day I feel the consequences of the vicious party divisions in Westminster. There is also confirmation that Stewart\u2019s video on the Millenium bridge was a genuine selfie, after he was forced to admit pretending to hold his phone in Kew Gardens during a clip he posted back in May. It now appears that the former international development secretary resigned on stage at the Royal Albert Hall last night, where he also read a letter from Boris Johnson\u2019s Eton house master in 1982. Stewart has released a video next to St Paul\u2019s cathedral, warning that London is in danger from Brexit and that \u201cextremism is taking over\u201d the UK. The former diplomat and deputy governor in Iraq also told the Standard: It\u2019s always difficult to run against your own party. It\u2019s been a painful journey for me. I suppose it was really crystallised when I had the Conservative whip removed. I\u2019ve been proud to be a member of the Conservative party. There are many values I share with it. I parted company largely over Brexit and the tone of the party, which has become increasingly aggressive. In a letter published in the Evening Standard, Stewart said: Our leaders have become so bad at listening to the people ... Instead, they have retreated to a madhouse of mutual insults in the Gothic shouting chamber of Westminster, pitting one group against another \u2013 rich against poor, London against the rest, Brexit against Remain \u2013 and all the time getting further and further away from compromise, practical solutions, and the centre ground. And this is why I\u2019ve decided to stand, not for a party, but as an independent. Stewart\u2019s decision marks a blow to the Tory candidate Shaun Bailey before the election in May 2020. The former youth worker\u2019s campaign has been criticised and the current mayor, Sadiq Khan, has remained odds-on to secure a second term. The president of the Conservative Association for Rory Stewart\u2019s constituency has said the party is heading in an \u201cextreme\u201d direction. Robert Craig, president of the Penrith and The Border Conservative Association, told the PA news agency: It\u2019s a great shame and it is not unexpected given he is still out in the wilderness with the whip removed. I suppose had that changed... it seems to have become clear that that wasn\u2019t going to change and he has other ambitions. Asked if Stewart would have remained as a Tory MP if the whip has not been withdrawn from him, Craig replied: \u201cPossibly.\u201d He said Stewart had told him of the decision about two weeks ago, and that the reason for his resignation would become clear later today. He was really popular and a great, inspirational MP, who actually appealed to a lot of people who wouldn\u2019t have got involved in the Conservative Party locally. In itself it is really sad because quite a lot of us are really quite fed up with where this situation has got now. The direction of the party... I really struggle now to align myself with the leadership and where we are heading, the extremity of where we are at. It\u2019s not broad it\u2019s not moderate, it\u2019s extreme. Craig added that he did not try and convince Stewart to remain in the post and instead \u201ccongratulated\u201d him on his next move, which he did not reveal. The Home Office minister Brandon Lewis told the Today programme this morning: From our point of view it\u2019s a final offer. But we are open and understand the fact that the EU may come back and say \u2018Look, this deal is fine, but can we just look at this...?\u2019 and we\u2019ll have to look at that when we get to that point. But I\u2019ve got to say, to be frank, as the prime minister said, this is our clear final deal. We think it\u2019s a good deal, it\u2019s a fair deal, it delivers both legally and security-wise for both our country here in the UK and obviously our friends in Europe. Asked if the government was willing to enter into negotiations, he said: From our point of view, this is the final deal, but we\u2019ll wait and see what our partners in the EU come back and say. He then claimed there was a \u201cbuilding majority\u201d of MPs who supported the plan. He also discussed police and security services having access to messages sent on the web, as Peter Walker notes. The Scottish National party MP Joanna Cherry has told Good Morning Scotland that Boris Johnson \u201chas form for doing things that are unlawful\u201d. We\u2019re not bringing this case because we think there\u2019s any loophole in the Benn act. We\u2019re bringing this case because we\u2019re dealing with a British prime minister who brags about not obeying the law and has form for doing things that are unlawful. Boris Johnson is not above the law, whether in Scotland or south of the border, thanks to the decision of the UK supreme court. If this court case achieves nothing else but getting him to be clear about what his position is, then it will have achieved something. Later today, the court of session \u2013 Scotland\u2019s highest civil court \u2013 will hear arguments about whether Boris Johnson can be forced to extend article 50. This would avert a no-deal Brexit if a deal is not struck and passed through parliament, and the legal action will ask the court to require Johnson to seek an extension to avoid leaving the EU without a deal. The legal action, led by the businessman Vince Dale, the Scottish National party MP Joanna Cherry, and the Good Law Project lawyer Jolyon Maugham QC, could also see a court official given the power to sign the letter if the prime minister refuses to do so. The Benn act was passed by parliament last month requiring the government to ask for an extension until 31 January if an agreement is not reached with the EU by 19 October. Cherry, who was described as the \u201cdriving force\u201d behind the case, said: Like much of what Boris Johnson says, there is a gulf of truth between the obvious facts of the matter and what he and his government have been saying. He cannot be trusted, and this court action is about ensuring he abides by the law. If Boris Johnson tries to defy the law and defy both the Holyrood and Westminster parliaments by crashing out of the EU without a deal \u2013 then we are calling on the Scottish courts to uphold the law. Maugham told the Independent yesterday: This is a very simple case. Our supreme parliament \u2013 elected from 46 million \u2013 has directed the prime minister \u2013 elected from 160,000 \u2013 to seek an extension. That is the law, and no man or woman is above it. Despite the announcement of Johnson\u2019s plans for Northern Ireland, many still suspect he will try to ignore the legislation \u2013 which is thought to only be able to obstruct no-deal \u2013 and leave the EU on 31 October regardless. The outer house court hearing today will seek an order to ensure Johnson requests an extension to the article 50 process if he refuses to abide by the terms of the Benn act. My colleague Severin Carrell will be at the court. MPs from beyond the Conservative party have tweeted about Stewart\u2019s resignation. Stewart, a former Cabinet minister, was among the 21 rebels who had the whip removed by Boris Johnson when they backed a move in the Commons designed to block a no-deal Brexit. The Penrith and The Border MP ran against Johnson in the race to lead the party in June, staging a memorable, old-school campaign where his video campaigning and public walkabouts earned him acclaim. However, he fell at the third hurdle \u2013 failing to receive enough endorsements from MPs \u2013 amid speculation that Johnson\u2019s supporters had acted in concert to oust Dominic Raab, after Stewart received fewer votes than in the previous ballot. Upon news of the vote, the then international development secretary said he frequently didn\u2019t know what Johnson \u201cactually believes about anything\u201d and that he was worried Johnson would let people down as PM. Stewart, a staunch opponent of a no-deal Brexit, did not immediately give any reason for his decision to leave the party. Nick Boles, who also resigned from the party earlier this year, said today marked \u201ca personal liberation for Rory\u201d. He tweeted: \u201cLast rites are being read for moderate One Nation conservatism. Rory Stewart joins Ruth Davidson, Sam Gyimah, Amber Rudd and many others. A sad day for British politics but a personal liberation for Rory who will go on to greater things, no doubt.\u201d Ruth Davidson, the former Tory leader in Scotland who resigned earlier this year, citing the conflict she felt over Brexit, tweeted: The former Tory leadership candidate Rory Stewart has resigned from the Conservative party, saying he will stand down at the next general election. You can read my colleague Peter Walker\u2019s story in full: Stewart\u2019s former cabinet colleague Amber Rudd tweeted: \u201cWhat a loss to politics. An outstanding MP and minister. One of the strongest speakers in parliament. Principled, patient, thoughtful. I feel certain he\u2019ll be back.\u201d We\u2019ll bring you developments as they happen, and here are all our latest political articles, as well as Politico\u2019s roundup of all today\u2019s news and a schedule for the day.",

      "bodyText": "John Lewis is threatening to withhold up to 20% of the service charges it owes to some of its shopping centre landlords, in protest at \u201cunacceptable\u201d increases in annual service charges over the last few years.

The retailer\u2019s squeeze on landlords comes just three weeks after the John Lewis Group \u2013 the department stores and the Waitrose supermarket chain \u2013 slumped to its first-ever half-year loss of \u00a326m, with the department stores performing worst, sliding \u00a362m into the red.

      "body": "<p>In a memo sent in 1969, the BBC head of comedy seems to have lost his sense of humour. \u201cPlease will you have a word with the writers?\u201d said Michael Mills. \u201cI haven\u2019t reacted to the funny titles that have appeared on the scripts so far. I hoped that they would cease of their own accord.\u201d</p> <p>The titles that irritated him included \u201cBunn Wackett Buzzard Stubble and Boot\u201d, apparently a spoof legal firm, which came to be shortened to Bunwackett. The show, meanwhile, had the working title The Circus. Now, though, Mills had had enough: \u201cThe time has come when we must stop having peculiar titles and settle on one overall title \u2026 Please would you have words with them and try to produce something palatable?\u201d</p> <p>Following this intervention, a title was finally agreed upon: Monty Python\u2019s Flying Circus. And on 19 September 1969, BBC North sent an invitation to journalists to go on location for the filming of the show at the Cow and Calf pub on Ilkley Moor. They were promised \u201ccrazy antics\u201d and \u201cthe first opportunity to see this new-style brand of late-night nutty comedy in action, and all its writer-stars: John Cleese, Terry Jones, Eric Idle, Graham Chapman and Michael Palin.\u201d (As would often be the case, the animator Terry Gilliam was omitted, though he played many on-screen roles, and his brutal cartoons were the show\u2019s signature innovation.)</p> <p>This memo and press release are among the documentation relating to the premiere, exactly 50 years ago, of Monty Python\u2019s Flying Circus. Until exhumed by a researcher, the creative entrails of old BBC shows are buried in pink folders, hole-punched and tied with green bootlaces. Now, a rare peek inside the binders has uncovered all the secrets of the Pythons\u2019 earliest days.</p> <p>The archive is especially important for this show. The Pythons included a prolific diarist \u2013 Palin has published three hefty volumes already \u2013 but, dismayingly, the months around the start of the first Python show are one of the longest gaps. Palin attributes this to the busy-ness of filming, and having a young child and ailing elderly father.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"64a9ebda67554f92330d0ea2197323337cc3b46e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/64a9ebda67554f92330d0ea2197323337cc3b46e/0_0_1786_2472/722.jpg\" alt=\"The minister for silly walks \u2026 Cleese in Monty Python\u2019s Flying Circus.\" width=\"722\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The minister for silly walks \u2026 Cleese in Monty Python\u2019s Flying Circus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Presumably following calculations on some abacus of celebrity value, accounts initially paid Cleese \u00a367 per show more than the others, Palin \u00a31 less than Jones and Chapman, and Idle \u00a32 less. Gilliam, an artist rather than \u201cartiste\u201d, was contracted separately.</p> <p>Although comic weirdness had been introduced to the BBC by The Goon Show, Monty Python went even further. BBC production teams may have sensed something odd was coming from the paperwork: a requisition form to the props department asks for a \u201cselection of bras (6), panties (6), and tights (5)\u201d and \u201c1 swastika flag, approx 4\u2019 x 2.6\u201d. A list of extras for a filming day includes, after one name, the specification \u201cno pigeon on shoulder\u201d (parrots, on shoulders and flat on their perch, would become a Python speciality). A handwritten note asks: \u201cWhat about topless on fountain?\u201d</p> <p>Most surreally, on 9 September, the show\u2019s producer John Howard Davies sent a memo to Bernard Wilkie in visual effects requesting \u201c1 copy of Turner\u2019s \u2018Fighting Temeraire\u2019 \u2026 in a detachable frame, which can be broken off and eaten \u2013 with two eatable refill frames\u201d. </p> <p>Later the same day, Wilkie\u2019s assistant returned the request with the note: \u201cUnfortunately \u2026 all edible props must be obtained through the Catering Manager.\u201d</p> <p>While the head of comedy had persuaded the team to pick a title, he could not persuade them to take editorial procedures seriously. The Pythons wanted to caption the first episode \u201cprogramme two\u201d, a joke the corporation chose to ignore. They also described their show as \u201cdesigned to subdue the violence in us all with gentle sick laughter\u201d. This was not passed on to the press, though the misleading subtitle \u201cWither Canada?\u201d was \u2013 which some newspaper previews reproduced unquestioningly.</p> <p>Having survived the threat of a strike by BBC staff over the controversy that the new comedy show was replacing a late-night religious programme \u2013 the corporation cleverly argued that the devotional show was shifted to spare clergymen a late night on their busiest day \u2013 Monty Python\u2019s Flying Circus was first transmitted at 22:50 on 5 October 1969.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"64ef760532897d92ff4e3d53613c1d5b74f140e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/64ef760532897d92ff4e3d53613c1d5b74f140e0/0_90_2821_1785/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trail-blazers \u2026 Monty Python.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"633\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trail-blazers \u2026 Monty Python.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A memo sent between senior executives reveals that the first episode achieved 1.5 million viewers with an audience appreciation (based on a small number of viewers paid to value what they watched) of 45 (out of 100). In comparison, the Rolf Harris Show (though in a primetime slot, and with a presenter then seen as a lovable family entertainer, rather than the convicted sex offender he later became) attracted 11 million viewers and a 64 enjoyment score.</p> <p>The public response, at least from the correspondence archived by the BBC, seems to have been positive. The fan letters are a rarity, in that they immediately mimic and celebrate the tone of the Pythons. What seems to be a furious letter from a wing commander (retired), complaining about the \u201clong-haired louts\u201d making fun of the flying machines that won the Battle of Britain, is revealed to be written by a 16-year-old called Philip.</p> <p>Another viewer called Rufus writes in the guise of an expert in the art or sport of \u201cblack pudding bending\u201d. A gentleman from Tunbridge Wells is not outraged, in line with the local stereotype, but engaged, repeatedly sending handwritten sketches that are politely declined on the grounds that the Pythons write all their own material.</p> <p>While Cleese has latterly attracted a reputation for irascibility, he is caught out in the files in a gesture of striking kindness. A Kent schoolboy called Doug Holman writes, asking for tickets to a recording. Cleese arranges for a pair to be sent. Doug, boldly, writes back, saying he is part of a large group of friends who want to go. Cleese contacts the BBC to request a further 14 tickets, suggesting that the young will be \u201cgood laughers\u201d.</p> <p>Given the passage of five decades, many of the early Python audience have joined the choir invisible with the programme\u2019s late parrot. But I tracked down a Doug Holman who grew up in Kent and is now 69, running a business in Hampshire. My email rapidly received the reply: \u201cIt\u2019s a fair cop! Hearty congratulations on your detective work.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"927ce14a12e0c8c64344573ee2cdaa9cffa0dff0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/927ce14a12e0c8c64344573ee2cdaa9cffa0dff0/0_0_1620_1062/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Continually going over the edge of what is acceptable\u2019 \u2026 the Pythons.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"656\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Continually going over the edge of what is acceptable\u2019 \u2026 the Pythons.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1969, he was an electronics student at Portsmouth University (then a polytechnic), and an obsessive fan of the radio show I\u2019m Sorry I\u2019ll Read That Again, starring Cleese.

      "bodyText": "In a memo sent in 1969, the BBC head of comedy seems to have lost his sense of humour. \u201cPlease will you have a word with the writers?\u201d said Michael Mills. \u201cI haven\u2019t reacted to the funny titles that have appeared on the scripts so far. I hoped that they would cease of their own accord.\u201d The titles that irritated him included \u201cBunn Wackett Buzzard Stubble and Boot\u201d, apparently a spoof legal firm, which came to be shortened to Bunwackett. The show, meanwhile, had the working title The Circus. Now, though, Mills had had enough: \u201cThe time has come when we must stop having peculiar titles and settle on one overall title \u2026 Please would you have words with them and try to produce something palatable?\u201d Following this intervention, a title was finally agreed upon: Monty Python\u2019s Flying Circus. And on 19 September 1969, BBC North sent an invitation to journalists to go on location for the filming of the show at the Cow and Calf pub on Ilkley Moor. They were promised \u201ccrazy antics\u201d and \u201cthe first opportunity to see this new-style brand of late-night nutty comedy in action, and all its writer-stars: John Cleese, Terry Jones, Eric Idle, Graham Chapman and Michael Palin.\u201d (As would often be the case, the animator Terry Gilliam was omitted, though he played many on-screen roles, and his brutal cartoons were the show\u2019s signature innovation.) This memo and press release are among the documentation relating to the premiere, exactly 50 years ago, of Monty Python\u2019s Flying Circus. Until exhumed by a researcher, the creative entrails of old BBC shows are buried in pink folders, hole-punched and tied with green bootlaces. Now, a rare peek inside the binders has uncovered all the secrets of the Pythons\u2019 earliest days. The archive is especially important for this show. The Pythons included a prolific diarist \u2013 Palin has published three hefty volumes already \u2013 but, dismayingly, the months around the start of the first Python show are one of the longest gaps. Palin attributes this to the busy-ness of filming, and having a young child and ailing elderly father. Presumably following calculations on some abacus of celebrity value, accounts initially paid Cleese \u00a367 per show more than the others, Palin \u00a31 less than Jones and Chapman, and Idle \u00a32 less. Gilliam, an artist rather than \u201cartiste\u201d, was contracted separately. Although comic weirdness had been introduced to the BBC by The Goon Show, Monty Python went even further. BBC production teams may have sensed something odd was coming from the paperwork: a requisition form to the props department asks for a \u201cselection of bras (6), panties (6), and tights (5)\u201d and \u201c1 swastika flag, approx 4\u2019 x 2.6\u201d. A list of extras for a filming day includes, after one name, the specification \u201cno pigeon on shoulder\u201d (parrots, on shoulders and flat on their perch, would become a Python speciality). A handwritten note asks: \u201cWhat about topless on fountain?\u201d Most surreally, on 9 September, the show\u2019s producer John Howard Davies sent a memo to Bernard Wilkie in visual effects requesting \u201c1 copy of Turner\u2019s \u2018Fighting Temeraire\u2019 \u2026 in a detachable frame, which can be broken off and eaten \u2013 with two eatable refill frames\u201d. Later the same day, Wilkie\u2019s assistant returned the request with the note: \u201cUnfortunately \u2026 all edible props must be obtained through the Catering Manager.\u201d While the head of comedy had persuaded the team to pick a title, he could not persuade them to take editorial procedures seriously. The Pythons wanted to caption the first episode \u201cprogramme two\u201d, a joke the corporation chose to ignore. They also described their show as \u201cdesigned to subdue the violence in us all with gentle sick laughter\u201d. This was not passed on to the press, though the misleading subtitle \u201cWither Canada?\u201d was \u2013 which some newspaper previews reproduced unquestioningly. Having survived the threat of a strike by BBC staff over the controversy that the new comedy show was replacing a late-night religious programme \u2013 the corporation cleverly argued that the devotional show was shifted to spare clergymen a late night on their busiest day \u2013 Monty Python\u2019s Flying Circus was first transmitted at 22:50 on 5 October 1969. A memo sent between senior executives reveals that the first episode achieved 1.5 million viewers with an audience appreciation (based on a small number of viewers paid to value what they watched) of 45 (out of 100). In comparison, the Rolf Harris Show (though in a primetime slot, and with a presenter then seen as a lovable family entertainer, rather than the convicted sex offender he later became) attracted 11 million viewers and a 64 enjoyment score. The public response, at least from the correspondence archived by the BBC, seems to have been positive. The fan letters are a rarity, in that they immediately mimic and celebrate the tone of the Pythons. What seems to be a furious letter from a wing commander (retired), complaining about the \u201clong-haired louts\u201d making fun of the flying machines that won the Battle of Britain, is revealed to be written by a 16-year-old called Philip. Another viewer called Rufus writes in the guise of an expert in the art or sport of \u201cblack pudding bending\u201d. A gentleman from Tunbridge Wells is not outraged, in line with the local stereotype, but engaged, repeatedly sending handwritten sketches that are politely declined on the grounds that the Pythons write all their own material. While Cleese has latterly attracted a reputation for irascibility, he is caught out in the files in a gesture of striking kindness. A Kent schoolboy called Doug Holman writes, asking for tickets to a recording. Cleese arranges for a pair to be sent. Doug, boldly, writes back, saying he is part of a large group of friends who want to go. Cleese contacts the BBC to request a further 14 tickets, suggesting that the young will be \u201cgood laughers\u201d. Given the passage of five decades, many of the early Python audience have joined the choir invisible with the programme\u2019s late parrot. But I tracked down a Doug Holman who grew up in Kent and is now 69, running a business in Hampshire. My email rapidly received the reply: \u201cIt\u2019s a fair cop! Hearty congratulations on your detective work.\u201d In 1969, he was an electronics student at Portsmouth University (then a polytechnic), and an obsessive fan of the radio show I\u2019m Sorry I\u2019ll Read That Again, starring Cleese. Noticing a poster in the student union advertising the comedian as guest speaker, Holman went and saw Cleese deliver a \u201cverbal assault on British Rail [he had arrived late] and BBC bureaucracy\u201d, before inviting the students to write to him if they wanted tickets for a recording of I\u2019m Sorry I\u2019ll Read That Again. Then, \u201calmost as an afterthought,\u201d Holman remembers, \u201che handed round a few copies of scripts for \u2018a new, as yet untitled, TV show\u2019 he was hoping would be commissioned. The copy I saw included strange references to things like exploding knees, but I confess the general reaction was one of polite perplexity.\u201d Holman wrote off for tickets to the radio show but, some days later, \u201cmy sister rushed into the kitchen blurting out: \u2018It\u2019s \u2026 John Cleese ... from the BBC ... for Doug!\u2019 Cleese explained that sadly, there would be no new series of ISIRTA that year, before asking whether I\u2019d be interested in tickets for the new TV show? In the heat of the moment, I suggested: \u2018How about four; that\u2019s four car-loads?\u2019 That\u2019s why the number of tickets increased from two to 16.\u201d The BBC response, the archives make clear, was far less positive. At the weekly meeting where senior managers discussed the output, the head of factual had found Python \u201cdisgusting\u201d, arts had thought it \u201cnihilistic and cruel\u201d, while religion objected to a Gilliam animation in which \u201cJesus \u2026 had swung his arm\u201d. The BBC One controller sensed the makers \u201ccontinually going over the edge of what is acceptable\u201d. In yet another sign of internal disapproval, the Pythons were commissioned to provide material for the 1969 Christmas Night with the Stars, the BBC end-of-year jamboree, but a brisk memo rejects their sketch. The archives also reveal an undertow of tension with the TV presenter and producer, David Frost. On 20 April 1969, while the first series is in pre-production, the writer-performer Barry Took, then a consultant for the BBC, warns Mills, the head of comedy: \u201cJohn Cleese phoned today to say that he is still under contract to Paradine Productions, who want to be involved in The Circus project as a co-production.\u201d Frost, only 30 but already a formidable TV impresario, owned Paradine (which was called after his middle name). Took reports that, if the BBC will not co-operate with Frost, Cleese will withdraw from The Circus. He recommends that the BBC produce a series with \u201cPalin, Jones, Idle and cartoon inserts from Terry Gilliam\u201d, then revive the idea of The Circus in 1971, when Cleese becomes free. There is always a moment when what is now a classic comes perilously close to not happening; this was Python\u2019s. The files do not reveal how the BBC saw off Frost, but the corporation seems to have played hard-ball. In another intrusion of real-life surreality into the Python story, the postmaster general at the time was John Stonehouse, who would soon afterwards fake his death by leaving his clothes on a beach in Miami, and was subsequently arrested by police officers who thought he was Lord Lucan, another prominent disappeared Briton of the era. Stonehouse was jailed for fraud, and revealed as a Czechoslovakian secret agent. Having censured Python over the Frost incident, he later inspired another major BBC comedy series: The Rise and Fall of Reginald Perrin, in which David Nobbs\u2019 hero pretends to have drowned in a swimming accident. On 11 August 1970, having commissioned a second run of Python, Mills laments in a memo to the BBC hierarchy: \u201cI am very unhappy that all the regions are opting out of the new series.\u201d The team had become victim to another BBC continuity announcement trope they liked to satirise: \u201cExcept for viewers in Scotland/Northern Ireland/Wales.\u201d But these rejections \u2013 and many memos reporting Cleese\u2019s reluctance to make another series \u2013 could not prevent the Pythons going on to conquer TV, cinema (Holy Grail, Life of Brian) and stage. Five decades after a 19-year-old student struck the audacious free-ticket deal immortalised in the BBC archives, Holman still energises his memories of the recording: \u201cThere was a restaurant scene but I think the producer abandoned it when Cleese \u2013 seemingly unhappy about having no lines \u2013 disrupted each take by performing random Tourette-like impressions of a mouse being strangled by a psychotic cat.

      "bodyText": "The House of Representatives speaker, Nancy Pelosi, the most powerful Democrat in Congress, announced on 24 September an impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump. The proceedings have developed with a swiftness and complexity that might leave some readers feeling dazed. Here\u2019s a thumbnail guide. What is Trump accused of? In a July 2019 phone call, Trump asked Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to mount an investigation of his potential rival for the White House in the 2020 election, Joe Biden, and son Hunter Biden \u2013 and also to investigate a Fox News-space conspiracy theory that Ukraine, instead of Russia, was behind foreign tampering in the 2016 election. Trump framed the requests as a \u201cfavor\u201d after he reminded his counterpart that \u201cthe United States has been very, very good to Ukraine\u201d. Overshadowing the conversation was the fact that Trump had recently suspended hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid that Congress had approved for Ukraine to defend itself against Russia . News of the call emerged in a Washington Post report on 18 September that an internal whistleblower complaint, filed in August, involved \u201ccommunications between Trump and a foreign leader\u201d. Trump\u2019s attempted dealings in Ukraine caused a scandal in US diplomatic ranks. The Democrats have obtained text messages between top US envoys in Ukraine establishing that diplomats told Zelenskiy that a White House visit to meet Trump was dependent on him making a public statement vowing to investigate Hunter Biden\u2019s company. \u201cAs I said on the phone, I think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d one message said. What\u2019s Trump\u2019s version of events? Trump does not dispute public accounts of what he said in the call, as established by the intelligence community whistleblower\u2019s complaint, released on 26 September, and a call summary released by the White House itself the day before. But Trump and allies have argued that the conversation \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ve given you that, now I need this\u201d \u2013 was not actually as transactional as it appears to be. That\u2019s beside the point legally, analysts say, but you be the judge. Meanwhile Trump and Republicans have, without denying their conduct, sought to undermine his accusers and frame the proceedings as, surprise, a partisan \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d. This sounds depressingly familiar, bye No hard feelings, bye! But really, that appears to be part of Trump\u2019s strategy here \u2013 to sow division and doubt to create the impression that this impeachment inquiry amounts to just one more crazy whirl around Washington\u2019s wacky partisan merry-go-round. It\u2019s a ride many Americans are truly sick of. Is this just one more whirl around Washington\u2019s partisan merry-go-round? The thing is, so long as Republicans in Congress don\u2019t contradict Trump, he has a lot of power to make it seem so. But just because Trump is out there red-faced and ranting, bullying and crying BULLSHIT \u2013 just because the president is throwing a fit about the allegation that he violated his oath of office or commited a crime does not mean he did not violate his oath or commit a crime. Did Trump violate his oath or commit a crime? A lot of people \u2013 from the whistleblower, to career government officials swept up in the affair, to legal scholars, to Democrats and Republicans who have not drunk the Trump \u201cKool-Aid\u201d \u2013 believe it\u2019s plausible that the president has committed an impeachable offense. What about the other foreign countries and people involved? In at least five countries, Trump or Trump administration officials have been active on two fronts: urging attacks on Biden and rewriting the story of the 2016 US election. Trump has conscripted the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, who listened in on the July Ukraine call and the attorney general, William Barr, who has met with government contacts in Italy and London and sought Australian contacts to review special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Trump-Russia investigation. That investigation had prompted much impeachment talk but the Ukraine scandal quickly sparked a formal impeachment inquiry. Meanwhile Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, has pressured Ukraine to smear Biden, and the whistleblower said White House officials had caused records of Trump\u2019s Ukraine call to be moved into a specially restricted computer system. And the vice-president, Mike Pence, has acknowledged contacts with Ukrainian officials while claiming to have no knowledge of Trump\u2019s Biden agenda. On 3 October, Trump even suggested that: \u201cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens.\u201d That\u2019s an abuse of power in plain sight, critics say. Trump, foreign election tampering \u2013 is this just a replay of Mueller? No. Unlike when he was a candidate, Trump\u2019s invitations for foreign powers to attack his domestic political opponents now have all the power of the White House behind them. Critics say this is a plain abuse of that power and stinks of despotism.And it undermines US national security because it places Trump\u2019s personal agenda first. In America, l\u2019\u00e9tat, c\u2019est pas moi. Trump is also accused of undermining the integrity of US elections, violating the civil rights of the US citizens he is calling out for foreign attack, and violating campaign finance laws by soliciting foreign help. The Trump administration also stands accused of obstruction of justice for resisting congressional subpoenas for documents and testimony relating to the crisis. What\u2019s next? The inquiry continues in the Democratic-dominated House of Representatives until \u2013 and Pelosi wants this ASAP \u2013 they are ready to vote. If a simple majority votes to impeach Trump he faces trial in the Republican-dominated US Senate. tl;dr: can you give that to me in tweet length?",

      "body": "<p>There is, Sharon Horgan has said, \u201ca massive overlap\u201d between her life and the TV comedies she has made. \u201cI had nothing, and now I have something, and I managed to cobble together a family and a relationship along the way,\u201d she said in an interview in 2016, \u201cbut at the heart of it I\u2019m still a mess, and there\u2019s still just a mess at the heart of all my work.\u201d</p> <p>A new series of the hit BBC <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/nov/04/motherland-vision-child-rearing-panic-inducingly-scary\">comedy drama Motherland</a> starts on Monday, co-written by Horgan. If there has been a fair amount of Horgan in the main character of hassled, tetchy mother Julia, \u2013 played by Anna Maxwell Martin \u2013 then there also must be, at least from the outside, some of her in the new character Meg. </p> <p>Impressive and wildly successful, Meg is a woman for whom motherhood and work are tackled with energy and ease. \u201cI just do what I need to do when I need to do it,\u201d she says. Meg is suspiciously close to \u201chaving it all\u201d \u2013 though in Horgan\u2019s world, nobody does. Julia looks at her with envy and awe, which is possibly not a feeling unfamiliar to anyone who has been following Horgan\u2019s career.</p> <p>Horgan is impressive and wildly successful, and gives a good impression of not being a mess: not only has Motherland been commissioned for a third series, but Horgan has written and directed an episode of Modern Love, a romantic comedy anthology based on the New York Times relationship column (as a mark of Horgan\u2019s pulling power, her episode stars Tina Fey).

They also co-wrote the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/26/the-circuit-review\">2016 comedy The Circuit</a>, about the horror of middle-class dinner parties.</p> <p>The pair met in the early 90s at a youth theatre, then bumped into each other a couple of years later in a pub in north London. He mentioned he had written a play and the next day Horgan phoned him to say they should put it on together. \u201cI honestly think, had I not bumped into her, I wouldn\u2019t have become a writer,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause I don\u2019t think I\u2019d have had the drive. Sharon always had a lot of drive and was quite fearless.\u201d He says Horgan hasn\u2019t changed much since they first met. \u201cShe was funny as fuck. We started working together but it blurred into friendship because she was a lot of fun.\u201d</p> <p>Horgan was born in Hackney but grew up in Ireland, where her mother is from, on her parents\u2019 turkey farm.

      "bodyText": "There is, Sharon Horgan has said, \u201ca massive overlap\u201d between her life and the TV comedies she has made. \u201cI had nothing, and now I have something, and I managed to cobble together a family and a relationship along the way,\u201d she said in an interview in 2016, \u201cbut at the heart of it I\u2019m still a mess, and there\u2019s still just a mess at the heart of all my work.\u201d A new series of the hit BBC comedy drama Motherland starts on Monday, co-written by Horgan. If there has been a fair amount of Horgan in the main character of hassled, tetchy mother Julia, \u2013 played by Anna Maxwell Martin \u2013 then there also must be, at least from the outside, some of her in the new character Meg. Impressive and wildly successful, Meg is a woman for whom motherhood and work are tackled with energy and ease. \u201cI just do what I need to do when I need to do it,\u201d she says. Meg is suspiciously close to \u201chaving it all\u201d \u2013 though in Horgan\u2019s world, nobody does. Julia looks at her with envy and awe, which is possibly not a feeling unfamiliar to anyone who has been following Horgan\u2019s career. Horgan is impressive and wildly successful, and gives a good impression of not being a mess: not only has Motherland been commissioned for a third series, but Horgan has written and directed an episode of Modern Love, a romantic comedy anthology based on the New York Times relationship column (as a mark of Horgan\u2019s pulling power, her episode stars Tina Fey). The comedy for which she is probably best known, Catastrophe, ended earlier this year after four series, while Divorce, a show she created for Sarah Jessica Parker, finished in the summer. \u201cHer work ethic is insane and it was sort of terrifying back at the beginning because my idea of work in those days was to talk about it in the pub, not to actually do it,\u201d says Dennis Kelly, who co-wrote with Horgan the brilliant, excruciating 2006 comedy Pulling, about three, single, thirty-something women which ran for two series and a special before being inexplicably cancelled by the BBC. They also co-wrote the 2016 comedy The Circuit, about the horror of middle-class dinner parties. The pair met in the early 90s at a youth theatre, then bumped into each other a couple of years later in a pub in north London. He mentioned he had written a play and the next day Horgan phoned him to say they should put it on together. \u201cI honestly think, had I not bumped into her, I wouldn\u2019t have become a writer,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause I don\u2019t think I\u2019d have had the drive. Sharon always had a lot of drive and was quite fearless.\u201d He says Horgan hasn\u2019t changed much since they first met. \u201cShe was funny as fuck. We started working together but it blurred into friendship because she was a lot of fun.\u201d Horgan was born in Hackney but grew up in Ireland, where her mother is from, on her parents\u2019 turkey farm. After failing to get into drama school, she moved to London, where she did some acting courses and fringe work around other jobs. By the time she met Kelly, she was in her late 20s and wondering if she would have a future in acting. Then they won the BBC\u2019s New Comedy Award, and Horgan has been building a loyal fanbase ever since for her scabrous, unflinching depictions of life and relationships. There were other shows, including Dead Boss, a 2012 comedy set in a prison, which she starred in and co-wrote, before the success of Catastrophe, which she created with Rob Delaney \u2013 they starred as a couple thrown together by an early accidental pregnancy, inspired by Horgan\u2019s own marriage. \u201cShe\u2019s a writer-performer who understands the intentions of her words in a way I hadn\u2019t experienced before,\u201d says Jack Bayles, the producer on Catastrophe and Channel 4\u2019s commissioning editor for comedy.

Often you\u2019ll get something that\u2019s trying to feel dramatic and takes a long time to sell you a character or story, and she can move through plot so quickly while still delivering jokes.\u201d Horgan is at a point in her career \u201cwhere she understands production. She\u2019s more like the US-style \u2018showrunner\u2019, and there are not so many of those around.\u201d Kelly says Horgan is \u201creally truthful\u201d in her work. \u201cThat seems to be really important to her. Making people laugh really matters to her as well. \u201cWhen we did Pulling we were trying to make sense of what our lives were at that time \u2013 we both did shitty jobs we hated, drank way too much and got into ridiculous situations.

I suppose that, literally speaking, Boris Johnson remains my prime minister. But spiritually, Jennifer Arcuri has now taken the role.</p> <p>Maybe you prefer the following gem, perhaps prompted by a question about the <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-stripper-pole-in-living-room-shouldve-raised-more-red-flags-says-ft-columnist-of-boris-johnson-friend-2019-09-25\" title=\"\">stripper\u2019s pole</a> she had in the technology-lessons apartment: \u201cI had the best fucking flat in east London.

Where are you at three o\u2019clock, I can, you know, stop over.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know.\u201d And, yes, you may feel like you DO know. At first glance, Arcuri would seem to be a throwback to the golden era of kiss-and tells, epitomised for me by <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/why-are-they-famous-lady-bienvenida-buck-1140672.html\" title=\"\">Bienvenida Buck</a> (then Lady Buck), who did a primetime TV advert for the News of the World in which she purred: \u201cTomorrow I reveal how your chief of defence staff was a Torrrrrrnado in my bed.\u201d</p> <p>That said, it must be stressed that Arcuri claims that there is no kissing to tell of. \u201cComplete bullshit\u201d, is her verdict. \u201cIf I was banging the dude,\u201d she opines mildly of the prime minister, \u201cand there was some kind of, like trail or sex tape, but there\u2019s nothing. There is a human side of my very complex relationship.\u201d And if you\u2019ve seen the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarinaHyde/status/1179289978951671808\" title=\"\">picture</a> of her biting the head off one of three fondant-icing Boris Johnsons on a London mayor-themed cake, you\u2019d be mad to argue with that claim of complexity.</p> <p>However unlikely this possibility may seem, I now hope against hope that she didn\u2019t actually have sex with the prime minister. The image of Boris Johnson turning up in the expectation of it, and having to listen to Silicon Valley blather while not actually getting any is my new idealised version of this story. Just picture him, asking leading questions about the stripper\u2019s pole, while she shows him how to do a PowerPoint. If there is a hell, this is what Johnson\u2019s would be like.</p> <p>Either way, thank God for this incredible new character. Jennifer has rocked up now, at a relatively late stage in the story, but you already couldn\u2019t imagine the franchise without her. Like Yoda, who doesn\u2019t appear until the second Star Wars movie. Ditto both Inspector Dreyfus and Cato, who only show up in the Pink Panther sequel. Indeed, in many ways, Jennifer combines different traits from all those three characters \u2013 a kind of pseudo-gnomic wisdom, allied to an incipient craziness. And a very real sense that she could judo chop the shit out of you as soon as you got through the front door.</p> <p>Here she is on why she was being promoted by the UK embassy in the US. \u201cI was extremely proactive. They didn\u2019t stop and go, \u2018Wait a minute, did you fuck Boris Johnson?\u2019\u201d At this point, the British ambassador inquiring, \u201cDid you fuck Boris Johnson?\u201d is about the only thing that could make the story better.</p> <p>And that is all credit to our picaresque heroine. I\u2019ll admit, I didn\u2019t get it at first. But Jennifer is, by the sounds of this, hilariously good value. Even under pressure in a supermarket car park, she is miles more amusing than Boris Johnson, whose hollowed-out narcissism has left him little more than a repository for the same seven knackered jokes and a series of second-class classics allusions. Jennifer, on the other hand, sounds like a card. I suspect she might grow a little rich for the blood in the second hour of dinner \u00e0 deux, but she\u2019d be a complete hoot to have along at a party. Party, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/03/sadiq-khan-boris-johnson-conflict-of-interest-probe-will-be-independent\" title=\"\">trade mission</a>, whatever.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/03/jennifer-arcuri-says-all-allegations-about-her-and-johnson-are-false\">Jennifer Arcuri 'says all allegations about her and Johnson are false'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Alas, having posted one of her top quotes online, I was disappointed to find gentlemen replying to sniff of Jennifer: \u201cWho talks like that?\u201d I don\u2019t know, guys. Whoever wants to? Maybe not to a reporter in a supermarket car park, I\u2019ll concede \u2026 but in the end, so what? I salute Arcuri for being able to laugh swashbucklingly about her cray-cray situation, even in the eye of the media storm. I am not remotely interested in those who are now going to question Johnson\u2019s judgment for ever going near her. She doesn\u2019t even make the cut of the top 1,000 people he should never have gone near \u2013 several of whom are in the cabinet, or bankrolled his leadership bid.</p> <p>Yes, Jennifer Arcuri can talk how she likes and do what she likes. And while I\u2019d selfishly like that to be \u201ctalk to a Sunday newspaper and offer much more of the same\u201d, it really is up to her. For now, she\u2019s a breath of Californian air in the increasingly rancid pea-souper of our politics, and I await her next move as a decided fan.</p> <p>\u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Either way, thank God for this incredible new character. Jennifer has rocked up now, at a relatively late stage in the story, but you already couldn\u2019t imagine the franchise without her. Like Yoda, who doesn\u2019t appear until the second Star Wars movie. Ditto both Inspector Dreyfus and Cato, who only show up in the Pink Panther sequel. Indeed, in many ways, Jennifer combines different traits from all those three characters \u2013 a kind of pseudo-gnomic wisdom, allied to an incipient craziness. And a very real sense that she could judo chop the shit out of you as soon as you got through the front door. Here she is on why she was being promoted by the UK embassy in the US. \u201cI was extremely proactive. They didn\u2019t stop and go, \u2018Wait a minute, did you fuck Boris Johnson?\u2019\u201d At this point, the British ambassador inquiring, \u201cDid you fuck Boris Johnson?\u201d is about the only thing that could make the story better. And that is all credit to our picaresque heroine. I\u2019ll admit, I didn\u2019t get it at first. But Jennifer is, by the sounds of this, hilariously good value. Even under pressure in a supermarket car park, she is miles more amusing than Boris Johnson, whose hollowed-out narcissism has left him little more than a repository for the same seven knackered jokes and a series of second-class classics allusions. Jennifer, on the other hand, sounds like a card. I suspect she might grow a little rich for the blood in the second hour of dinner \u00e0 deux, but she\u2019d be a complete hoot to have along at a party. Party, trade mission, whatever. Alas, having posted one of her top quotes online, I was disappointed to find gentlemen replying to sniff of Jennifer: \u201cWho talks like that?\u201d I don\u2019t know, guys. Whoever wants to? Maybe not to a reporter in a supermarket car park, I\u2019ll concede \u2026 but in the end, so what? I salute Arcuri for being able to laugh swashbucklingly about her cray-cray situation, even in the eye of the media storm. I am not remotely interested in those who are now going to question Johnson\u2019s judgment for ever going near her. She doesn\u2019t even make the cut of the top 1,000 people he should never have gone near \u2013 several of whom are in the cabinet, or bankrolled his leadership bid. Yes, Jennifer Arcuri can talk how she likes and do what she likes. And while I\u2019d selfishly like that to be \u201ctalk to a Sunday newspaper and offer much more of the same\u201d, it really is up to her. For now, she\u2019s a breath of Californian air in the increasingly rancid pea-souper of our politics, and I await her next move as a decided fan. \u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist",

The general prosecutor, Ruslan Ryaboshapka, said the review was part of Ukraine\u2019s reform process as investigative powers are handed over to another government agency by the middle of next month. At a press conference on Friday, Ryaboshapka said he had no evidence of any wrongdoing by Hunter Biden and had not been contacted by Donald Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who has spearheaded an informal investigation into the Biden family for the US president. Trump has demanded the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, open an investigation into Hunter Biden for his work in Ukraine, and into his father for urging the country to fire the then general prosecutor, Viktor Shokin. Asked whether he would investigate the pair, Ryaboshapka said he was holding an \u201caudit of all cases\u201d, a docket numbering in the thousands, which could include about 15 relating to the energy company Burisma. In a follow-up statement, Ryaboshapka said his office was reviewing \u201chigh-profile proceedings concerning senior officials\u201d under the former president Viktor Yanukovych, including cases tied to Burisma\u2019s owner, Mykola Zlochevsky. The statement stressed \u201cno procedural decisions\u201d had been made against Zlochevsky or \u201cany persons related\u201d. The decision is not a full accession to Trump\u2019s demands, as the earlier Burisma cases under review do not directly involve Hunter Biden or his father\u2019s political influence. Ryaboshapka\u2019s remarks on Friday appeared to be part of Ukraine\u2019s continued strategy of resisting the Trump administration\u2019s demands for a full investigation, while avoiding antagonising the US president. Ukraine, where a revolution took place in 2014, relies heavily on the US and Europe for financial support for reforms and military aid. Trump\u2019s pressure on Ukraine to investigate his potential opponent in the 2020 elections has led to an impeachment inquiry in Washington. Shokin was widely regarded as corrupt, and there is no evidence Biden sought to have him fired for investigating Burisma. Hunter Biden\u2019s appointment to the board of directors of Burisma, with a reported monthly salary of $50,000 (\u00a341,000), has been the subject of an investigation by Giuliani.

The funniest sketch I\u2019ve ever seen \u2026 Norris and Parker being sex witches. I saw their last show so many times. Not out of choice; I lived with them and they performed often. The funniest person I know \u2026 My sister, Lulu. When I was in hospital last year after my discs prolapsed and I couldn\u2019t walk, feel my legs or control my bladder, Lulu told me to \u201cstop being a drama queen\u201d and said: \u201cPut it in perspective, at least you don\u2019t have leprosy.\u201d The funniest heckle I\u2019ve ever had \u2026 A child once said: \u201cWhy are you doing this to us?\u201d at a Comedy Club 4 Kids gig. The funniest hairstyle I\u2019ve ever had \u2026 When I was 15 I used to have cornrows. Because I wanted to be a rapper. I will let that settle in. The funniest meal I\u2019ve ever eaten \u2026 I don\u2019t eat food that is the colour red. Some people think that is funny. I don\u2019t know why. Tomatoes make me cry. The funniest dream I\u2019ve ever had \u2026 Two months ago, I dreamed I married Stormzy and we remade the Saw films as a musical. We had a baby together and when I woke up and realised it wasn\u2019t real I wept because I was so proud of the work we had made together. In that dream we were visionaries. The funniest word \u2026 Plop. Elf Lyons: Love Songs to Guinea Pigs is at Salford, Saturday 5 Octover; Brighton, Wednesday 9 October; tour continues to 21 November",

It was a paired-down style of play early on, built from robust defence and keen discipline. Just six penalties (after they conceded nine, and some crucial ones at that, against the All Blacks), some incredible hits, but more than that, a grinding, consistent, controlled malevolence.</p> <p>The red card to Lovotti killed Italy, but the body blows had already been struck by then. The rolling maul was unstoppable, the lineout unflappable, and the work at the breakdown was not too shabby either.</p> <p>Knockout stage opponents will look nervously at the permutations that lie ahead now. This is a team you want to avoid - not just because they might beat you - but because even if they don\u2019t, they\u2019ll put you through the absolute wringer (and your next opponents then might).</p> <p>The Japan 2019 dream is over for Italy, but for South Africa it may yet just be taking form.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d97370f8f084ab8417329c4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-04T12:15:56.544Z\">1.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And it\u2019s a big triple-header of rugby action from the Japan World Cup tomorrow. </p> <p>We start with Australia playing host to Uruguay for entree, then it\u2019s the very tasty main course of England v Argentina, with a Japan-Samoa clash for pudding.

His replacement succumbed to concussion after a nasty bump on the noggin inside just 18 minutes. </p> <p>And then, just minutes back onto the pitch after a bruising first half, a third prop - Andrea Lovotti, saw red. A justified sanction at a World Cup where repeatedly we\u2019ve heard that protection of the head must be paramount.

      "bodyText": "It was billed as a potential banana-skin fixture for South Africa - after all, a loss today and they\u2019d be contemplating a Rugby World Cup group-stage exit for the very first time. But there\u2019s something very impressive about this Rassie Erasmus-led Boks outfit - as Italy discovered today to their detriment. No nerves, no hesitation. It was a paired-down style of play early on, built from robust defence and keen discipline. Just six penalties (after they conceded nine, and some crucial ones at that, against the All Blacks), some incredible hits, but more than that, a grinding, consistent, controlled malevolence. The red card to Lovotti killed Italy, but the body blows had already been struck by then. The rolling maul was unstoppable, the lineout unflappable, and the work at the breakdown was not too shabby either. Knockout stage opponents will look nervously at the permutations that lie ahead now. This is a team you want to avoid - not just because they might beat you - but because even if they don\u2019t, they\u2019ll put you through the absolute wringer (and your next opponents then might). The Japan 2019 dream is over for Italy, but for South Africa it may yet just be taking form. And it\u2019s a big triple-header of rugby action from the Japan World Cup tomorrow. We start with Australia playing host to Uruguay for entree, then it\u2019s the very tasty main course of England v Argentina, with a Japan-Samoa clash for pudding. Suit you, sir. He\u2019s famous for his mind games, but Eddie Jones reckons he hasn\u2019t been in Nigel Owens\u2019 ear before England\u2019s key clash. Here\u2019s the latest from Gerrard Meagher: While Paul Rees takes a detailed look at the high-flying host nation - on an unprecedented four-consecutive-World-Cup-wins: So, if you\u2019re just joining us now (long lie in in Italy?) here\u2019s the executive summary: And here\u2019s how the overall tournament top scorers list looks: What a tournament for hookers this is turning into - first a double for Tolu Latu, now it\u2019s Bongi Mbonambi showing the wingers how to do it. For Rassie Erasmus, he\u2019d be delighted with what he saw from his chargers. He said pre-game he didn\u2019t need to overanalyse the performance - he just wanted the result. Well he got both. A thumping result, and a pretty decent performance as well. Yes, there were some handling concerns in the first half. From the set piece the backline look nowhere near as fluent as it should have been. It was far from a flawless showing from the Boks. But if you\u2019re crystal-balling ahead to the knockout stages this is a side anyone would want to avoid, if they\u2019re in this kind of form. Unflinching, unswerving from their responsibilities. A team very much on the front foot. For Conor O\u2019Shea and his coaching staff, they\u2019d be pulling their hair out (if any was to hand) after no doubt weeks and months of planning, nights spent tossing and turning, and countless idle hours coming up with winning schemes. That couldn\u2019t have gone much worse for the Italians. It started with the loss of prop Simone Ferrari - inside a minute - with a suspected hamstring tear. His replacement succumbed to concussion after a nasty bump on the noggin inside just 18 minutes. And then, just minutes back onto the pitch after a bruising first half, a third prop - Andrea Lovotti, saw red. A justified sanction at a World Cup where repeatedly we\u2019ve heard that protection of the head must be paramount. And he and Quaglio then dumped the unfortunate Vermeulen right on his. So - let\u2019s take a look at the tables with that result included: With a massive points differential and a second bonus point secured, South Africa leapfrog Italy into top spot in Pool B - albeit with the All Blacks still with a game to play. Let\u2019s be very clear though - any talk of the Springboks missing a quarter-finals berth, for the first time at a Rugby World Cup, can be well and truly put to bed. And there it is! As dominant a performance as you\u2019ll see against a tier one nation at this World Cup. We wondered how they were feeling after that narrow loss to the All Blacks, and tonight South Africa well and truly fired a warning shot across the bows of world rugby. Ferocious, ruthless, imperious. What a showing from the Springboks. 80 min: They play past the gong, the Boks. And why not when you\u2019re in this mood. And it\u2019s the veteran, who crashes over after another truly dominant rolling maul from the Boks. They showed us that early in the piece, and then tucked it away for a while. But what a fitting way to finish this match! No extras from Pollard. We must have hurt his feelings. 78 min: Concern late on for South African fans - it\u2019s Kolbe off on another of his mazy runs, but he appears to have pulled up lame. A big worry if that will affect his place later on in the tournament - what a game he\u2019s had today, the diminutive winger. 76 min: They pressing for a baker\u2019s round 50 (don\u2019t @ me), the Boks. They were unrelenting in their pressure first half, and now they\u2019re making hay and enjoying themselves. The fullback Minozzi got himself in a real mess after great defensive pressure from Kolbe, and it was easy as you\u2019d like for Snyman to open his account. Pollard. He\u2019s missed. What\u2019s going on? Real black mark, this. 73 min: It\u2019s South Africa, unsurprisingly on the attack once again, and Mapimpi, having just opened his account for the match is suddenly lurking like a vulture for a second. He\u2019s denied metres short of the line, but it feels very much just a matter of time before Gli Azzurri\u2019s (did I get that one right?) line is breached once more. 70 min: It\u2019s dejection all round in the Italian coaching boxes. Conor O\u2019Shea called for a Herculean effort from his chargers, but about now thoughts start turning to damage control, and ensuring they have something left for the clash with the All Blacks. They\u2019ve never beaten New Zealand, Italy. That\u2019s now what they have to do to stay alive. 67 min: And lest anybody feel they\u2019re missing out, after the Kolbe show (in flashes) we\u2019ve got a try for South Africa\u2019s other winger. Mapimpi helps himself to one, and it\u2019s well and truly time to call the vet in. It was a chip down the middle, and the winger strolls in easily, under the posts. Pollard strikes the conversion, two more points. 65 min: So after the war of attrition that we\u2019ve seen, no surprises that both sides have almost entirely emptied their benches. Plenty of fresh players on in both green and blue. A close up of a dejected Sergio Parisse on the Italy bench. His side has been clattered, and the veteran hangs his head - knowing that the World Cup miraculous is now beyond them. An Italian lesson on the run for yours truly. Too much time covering Barbara Bonansea and her pals at the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup, clearly. Apologies to Azzurri fans of either gender, plural or singular. That\u2019s what happens when I try fancy things. Back to haddock and chips, me. 60 min: So. The last time these two sides met it finished 35-6 in Padua. This one looks like it might get a little nastier than that. But before you despair, Azzurri fans, remember that just over 20 years ago in Durban it finished 101-0. Even with their tails up, I can\u2019t see the Boks putting on 15 tries today. 57 min: Cometh the hour, cometh off the wheels. They\u2019re done now, Italy. Am with an acre of space to run into - these boys are hard to stop with fifteen out there, let alone 14. A big turnover from Italy, as a forced pass fell nicely into the arms of the flying outside centre. And he\u2019s cantered home from 40m out. Pollard back on the money, with the conversion attempt. 55 min: They\u2019re on the attack again, South Africa - this could get nasty. Le Roux flicks a lofted pass to Am, but the Italian scrambling defence covers well. The ball falls to ground - is there a chance to counter attack? No! It\u2019s Kolbe, who bundles his opponent into touch! 52 min: And here it comes! The man advantage is going to be exploited at some stage, and he\u2019s in for a double, Kolbe. The smallest man on the field, but with the fastest feet, you\u2019d warrant. Pollard looks for him with the crossfield kick, and he claims it nicely. And remarkably - turns out he is human - Pollard\u2019s missed one! A tricky touchline special, but meat and drink for this guy. 50 min: Pollard. Three points. And those are the first of the half. Remarkably. What a test of character this will now be for the Italians. They\u2019ve been battered for 50-odd minutes, now they have to chase a 17-point deficit, with 14 men. 49 min: A string of infringements - Italian hands everywhere, and we have a chance for Pollard to aim at the sticks. Benefit of the doubt says desperation, but gee. 47 min: It\u2019s the box kick from Tebaldi and Parisse almost regains, but they counter attack quickly the Boks. Oh my! But with Le Roux flying down the wing, he puts it on the toe - but scuffs it straight into touch! He looks embarrassed the fullback - he\u2019s duffed that. 46 min: Italy with some sustained possession, but largely going side to side. And the Boks are able to clear their line. Italian lineout feed just inside South Africa\u2019s half. 44 min: No try! It was \u201cTwo metre Pieter\u201d who crashed over - and it looked like Italy\u2019s game was going to instantly head south, but the try has been chalked out for obstruction in the lead up. Good spot, refereeing team. No floodgates opening - just yet. 43 min: A minute of madness for Le Azzurri - they had made a terrific break, had South Africa scrambling, but in a flash of bad temper, they\u2019ve lost a third prop of the game - two from injury, one from insult. Silly, silly business. 42 min: It\u2019s a big bust by Steyn for Italy! He looks for the support runner, Tebaldi is there but he\u2019s swamped by covering defence. They\u2019re eventually pulled down and we halt for a penalty. There\u2019s another dodgy cleanout from the Italians, and Vermeulen remains injured. Ay, ay, ay. It\u2019s a very nasty tip tackle from Lovotti and Quaglio - and it\u2019s a red card! Not the start the Italians would have wanted. Second half! No rest for the wicked, and we\u2019re back. Pollard gets us going and the South African tackling ferocity continues. A five-man lineout this time from the Boks, but again their backline move doesn\u2019t work, as they cough up another easy turnover. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen anyone bash anyone like this all World Cup\u201d. That\u2019s the half-time assessment from the antipodean commentary crew I happen to be watching - is that your read as well? And from an Italian perspective then, how do you counter this? So. Your reflections on that opening 40? And is there any way back for the Italians? It felt tough, unrelenting, and extremely physical - even despite the lack of scrums. I have to admit, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen a team lose two tight-head props inside twenty minutes in a game of rugby before. Anyone? Classic tales from yore? 39 min: They build the phases, the Boks, but they\u2019ve conceded a penalty, as the skipper arrives late to a clean out. Italy clear their lines, to huge relief. And there\u2019s the gong. South Africa will be pretty happy with that showing - they\u2019ve hammered their opponents, unrelentingly. 37 min: South Africa play to the backs this time, but its du Toit who pops up in the line, and pops up the ball! Can\u2019t blame the backs for that one. Kicking error for Italy - as they kick into touch after a pass back into the 22m. South Africa with a big chance to really hurt their opponents on the scoreboard, just before half time. 35 min: It\u2019s another stoinking rolling maul from the Boks, gaining 10-15m at a canter, and it earns another penalty as Mbonambi is caught slightly high. 34 min: It\u2019s against the winger Benvenuti for cleaning out illegally - he did appear to grab a South African player around the head. Clear penalty - a fifth against the Italians already. 32 min: The crowd comes alive (at least the Italian quotient of it). Again, it\u2019s a big mean green wall that greets them. This has been ferocious tackling from South Africa. The fullback Minozzi tries to get around his tackler, but runs out of territory. Italy recycle, but we stop for a TMO. Was there a high tackle? 30 min: We set for another rugby league scrum, and South Africa clear their lines with the kick. Again, not huge distance, so a small glimmer of hope for Italy to build something here? Penalty to Italy for a tackle on Budd in the air. Now they\u2019re definitely a sniff. 28 min: So, Riccioni is officially not coming back - Italy have lost both tight-head props for the match, and we will have uncontested scrums for the remainder of the match. Look for mauls to become big then. Some of these big front rowers will be steaming at being robbed like this. 26 min: That was one heck of a driving maul. It was as if the South African forwards, fresh from a lack of scrum contestations decided to burn off some extra energy - they push Le Azzurri 10-15m back and the big hooker glimpses an opening and dives over! Pollard - no mistake (duh) from the conversion. 25 min: Ach! They spread wide and Kolbe throws a stinging pass; but Le Roux grasses it! We come back for another penalty though - they might be edging towards yellow card danger, the Italians. 24 min: The South Africans cheer again, another turnover at the ruck. They haven\u2019t exactly been on the back foot, but that did feel like perhap\u2019s Italy\u2019s best attacking patch of the game. Now what can the Boks muster - lineout feed, halfway. 22 min: Big turnover! Great work Vermeulen, and they hold up Polledri and it doesn\u2019t come out. Another scrum. Thumping kick for clearance, they take 50m and we\u2019re back on half way. 21 min: Some one-out runs - yikes, some of these hits are bone-shuddering. Parisse pops a pass off the shoulder but his runner is absolutely crunched, and we\u2019ve got a ball down. Meanwhile Tebaldi is down with a suspected dislocated finger. Gee it\u2019s rugged out there so far. It\u2019s an Italian scrum feed (uncontested) once again - was there a South African hand in that? I didn\u2019t spot it, but presumably so. 20 min: It\u2019s been a bruising first twenty, as you\u2019d expect given the weight of this Boks pack, but the Italians have done well to give as good as they\u2019ve got so far. Well done, Budd who earns his side a scrum, as Hollard spills the ball after an ankle tap. Uncontested - so let\u2019s see what they can set up from here, Italy. 18 min: Hmm. Riccioni has gone off for a HIA (was there a head knock somewhere?) - so referee Barnes has called \u201cuncontested scrums\u201d for the next 10 minutes, given Italy are out of tight-head props already! Wild. You don\u2019t see that every day. South Africa look a little bemused. Has that neutralised one of their weapons? 17 min: Italy look to build some phases before firing a box kick. But they don\u2019t get much distance. South Africa return the favour, but the kick is too long for the chasers, and Italy bring out without too much danger. They have it again around halfway, before Tebaldi finds a well-weighted kick to the corner. Kolbe returns fire, but the metres go the way of Italy, as does the lineout feed. 16 min: Ach. Opportunity botched. The Boks win their offensive lineout but De Klerk faffs it and fumbles a knock on. Scrum, Italian feed. 14 min: Riiccioni continues, for now. The Boks win their lineout, around half way, and look to drive a rolling maul. Italy just manage to slow it, before South Africa fire a long pass out to Mapimpi, but we come back for a penalty for coming in from the side. A sloppy one to concede. 13 min: It\u2019s the up-and-under from De Klerk, and it\u2019s into touch for a South African feed with a touch from Italy en route. Oh my. Marco Riccioni - the man who came on as a replacement prop for the injured Ferrari - is down with a suspected rib injury. Who in the Italian camp walked under a ladder, with a black cat, a broken mirror, and didn\u2019t throw salt over their left shoulder? Awful luck. No mistake from Pollard. Why do I feel like I\u2019ll just be writing that a lot today, already. He really is a terrific kicker. What the Wallabies (or All Blacks) wouldn\u2019t give for a man like that. We\u2019re back to a converted try difference. 10 min: South Africa on the attack once again - they\u2019re hunting and probing under a penalty advantage. They can\u2019t find the corner this time, through Kolbe, so they return about 10m out. Slightly high on du Toit from Allan. Hard to do when he\u2019s over 2m, but there you go. Lovely strike from Tommaso Allan. It\u2019s not the most straightforward conditions out there - a little breeze, and he needed to hit it cleanly. A good nerve settler, they\u2019re on the board, Italy. 7 min: Italy with some good sustained possession now - and they\u2019ve drawn the penalty as Mbonambi fails to roll away. Tough that - it was a fine tackle, but he did appear to get himself pinned the South African. 5 min: Yes they do! It\u2019s the fast feet from Kolbe, who beats his marker well to break past one man in blue and stretches out over the line, just inside the corner post. No mistake from Pollard from the touchline, extras added. 4 min: South Africa on the attack and they look to spread the play wide - have they got the territory? There was a bunch of hard running up the centre to create the chance. 2 min: Double knock-on as heavy contacts fly round everywhere. Real concern for the Italian prop, Simoni Ferrari - he may have done a hamstring here. Awful blow, so early in the match. 1 min: It\u2019s England\u2019s Wayne Barnes with the whistle, and he says \u201cfill your boots lads\u201d, and Italy duly oblige. South Africa clear their lines but there\u2019s a marginal knock on during a contested ball, and we settle for a first scrum of the contest. There\u2019s the anthems - impeccably observed and sung with gusto, as has become the trend at this World Cup. Both sides looking suitably amped for this. Here. We. Go! Our players are heading out onto the field, to be met with another spectacular crowd alongside these terrific Japanese drummers. Anthems to come, but a quick line from Robin Hazlehurst who points out another way Italy could progress: If typhoons hit today and for the match against NZ so that both are abandoned and called draws, Italy will progress - any Italian fans hoping the apocalypse strikes in the next ten minutes so that they will be preserved forever like Pompeii? Good point, I did miss that scenario! NJK BAD (sinister?) has written in too: It would make this a perfect Murphy\u2019s Law Irish World Cup to see Italy get through in second place to face the group winning Japanese whilst we\u2019re being pasted all over the park by the All Blacks. Look. We don\u2019t want to overplay the whole \u201canything can happen at a World Cup\u201d angle, but, you know.. So - where it will be won and loss? Who will be the X-factors? Sergio Parisse - Italy\u2019s talismanic skipper is back, and goes past Brian O\u2019Driscoll on the list of all-time cap winners; just the great Richie McCaw sits above him. He was named as one of Guardian\u2019s three players to watch pre-tournament for Italy. And for South Africa, all the chat is about their explosive winger, Cheslin Kolbe, but with height (and weight) in the forwards likely to be a factor today, I fancy \u201cTwo metre Pieter\u201d to have a fair impact today. Alongside the metronomic kicking of Handr\u00e9 Pollard, there\u2019s plenty of areas the Boks can win it. But is there any chance they could contrive, psychologically to lose it? A fun permutation of today - people are saying if Italy win, they\u2019re through (and conversely South Africa miss their first quarter-finals berth in World Cup history). BUT - Italy can also draw the match; and if provided they pick up a bonus point and South Africa don\u2019t, they can still sneak through, irrespective of how things play out against NZ in their final group game. Imagine. Without further ado, to team news: 10 changes for South Africa from the Namibia game - no surprises there, given fixture congestion many sides have shuffled their packs to little complaint (cough, Fiji). South Africa: (15-1) 15 Willie le Roux, 14 Cheslin Kolbe, 13 Lukhanyo Am, 12 Damian de Allende, 11 Makazole Mapimpi, 10 Handr\u00e9 Pollard, 9 Francois de Klerk, 8 Duane Vermeulen, 7 Pieter-Steph du Toit, 6 Siyamthanda Kolisi (c), 5 Lodewyk de Jager, 4 Eben Etzebeth, 3 Frans Malherbe, 2 Mbongeni Mbonambi, 1 Tendai Mtawarira. Bench: 16 Malcolm Marx, 17 Steven Kitshoff, 18 Vincent Koch, 19 Rudolph Snyman, 20 Franco Mostert, 21 Francois Louw, Herschel Jantjies, 23 Frans Steyn. While it\u2019s a similar return to full-strength for the Italians. Italy: (15-1) 15 Matteo Minozzi, 14 Tommaso Benvenuti, 13 Luca Morisi, 12 Jayden Hayward, 11 Michele Campagnaro, 10 Tommaso Allan, 9 Tito Tebaldi, 8 Sergio Parisse (c), 7 Jake Polledri, 6 Braam Steyn, 5 Dean Budd, 4 David Sisi, 3 Simone Ferrari, 2 Luca Bigi, 1 Andrea Lovotti. Bench: 16 Federico Zani, 17 Nicola Quaglio, 18 Marco Riccioni, 19 Alessandro Zanni, 20 Federico Ruzza, 21 Sebastian Negri, 22 Callum Braley, 23 Carlo Canna. But - back to Pool B and our \u201cDay of Reckoning\u201d clash. Your thoughts and predictions ahead of this one? Any bold as brass calls from confident Azzurri fans? Any nerves from dubious Boks supporters? As always, Guardian\u2019s play-by-play coverage is a train that picks up all passengers - fire us an email or tweet to join in festivities today. And of course for our northern hemisphere readers on England-watch, here\u2019s Rob Kitson, running the rule over the latest out of camp ahead of a crunch-clash with Argentina: And if Tom Curry isn\u2019t a name known around the world of rugby, here\u2019s a nice little profile from Gerard Meagher: So plenty to sink your teeth into while we await kickoff in Shizuoka today. Hi all! Salutations to thee and thine, from whatever far flung corner of the globe you\u2019re following our coverage today. Its been a cracking effort from some of our writers over in Japan, scurrying round endless stadium catacombs and no doubt quaffing endless sub-standard feeds-on-the-run to bring you the latest. I love this column from Paul Rees on the state of refereeing inconsistencies across the tournament - \u201creffing hell\u201d seems to capture the mood brilliantly: It\u2019s Pool B\u2019s day of reckoning. With shock results in Pools A and D (and a near miss in Pool C), it\u2019s time for some competitive drama to visit upon the hitherto most unevenly matched pool. Group leaders Italy have had it relatively easy thus far - Namibia and Canada weren\u2019t exactly cakewalks, but there will be a notable step up in intensity for their game against a South Africa no-doubt still smarting from it\u2019s narrow opening round loss to New Zealand. The Springboks have never failed to reach the World Cup quarter finals. Could that day be today? Despite their vast tier-one experience from the Six Nations and Rugby Championship respectively, these two nations haven\u2019t played a lot against each other, and never at a World Cup. The Boks boast a 13-1 overall record, but tellingly that one loss came just two clashes ago, in 2016. And as Wales showed Australia, sometimes mismatched records are there to be broken. South Africa should shade it across the park - up front, in the backline, in goal kicking, at set piece. Still, write Italy off at your peril. A key clash for determining who goes through to the knockouts - so get the kettle on and your to-do lists cleared.",

I was also very overweight, completely inactive except walking my two dogs. Being so unfit and unhealthy, my opinion of myself was low, which limited a lot of my activity and self-confidence, but then a friend suggested parkrun.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d never heard of it before as, quite frankly, it\u2019s not something I would have ever considered as for me. I researched it on the internet and sent an initial email \u2013 I think if I\u2019m honest, I was hoping they would say, \u2018No, you\u2019re too slow and don\u2019t run the whole 5k, so thanks but no thanks\u2019. But they were wonderful, so welcoming, happy for me to walk the whole thing or whatever suited me.\u201d</p> <p>The NHS assistant director, who has since completed four 10km runs and a half marathon, said she was drawn to the event due to the lack of hierarchy and intensity normally associated with mass participation sporting events.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about coming first or winning. You can go at your own pace and just enjoy being with other people. It is so inclusive and the perfect way to start your weekend in the outdoors chatting to people. It has completely changed my outlook on life,\u201d said Nisbet.</p> <p>Of the almost 2,000 parkruns held each week in 21 countries, 25 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/nov/24/parkrun-youth-jail-sense-of-pride\">take place in prisons</a> \u2013 18 in the UK, two in Ireland and five in Australia \u2013 where prisoners and staff often complete multiple laps of an exercise yard to reach 5km.</p> <p>Next week, parkrun will reach another landmark by launching its first prison event in the UK for women only, following the lead of Australia.</p> <p>The fastest recorded time at any parkrun was set in 2012 in Bushy Park by the British Olympian Andy Baddeley, who finished in 13 minutes and 48 seconds.</p> <p>Charlotte Arter set the best women\u2019s time of 15 minutes and 50 seconds in Cardiff in January. Notable participants include the Olympians Jessica Ennis-Hill and Dame Kelly Holmes.</p> <p>But parkrun organisers, who are keen to avoid putting people off with competitive comparisons and are delighted for people to walk the course, do not have a record of the slowest time.</p> <p>Sinton-Hewitt said: \u201cOne of the things that I\u2019m most proud of is that every year the average finish time at parkrun has slowed. That means we are reaching more people for whom physical activity hasn\u2019t been the norm.</p> <p>\u201cI would like to see that continue, and for more people to understand that parkrun is truly welcoming of those who want to walk, jog, run or volunteer, especially those who would like to take their first steps on the path of being physically active.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Paul Sinton-Hewitt had reached a crossroads in his life: sacked from his marketing job and having had an injury that ended his marathon hopes, he organised a run around his local park in London one Saturday, timing his friends\u2019 efforts before they all went for a cooked breakfast. That meeting of 13 runners for the first parkrun has since morphed into a global phenomenon. This week, parkrun celebrated its 15th birthday, with 6 million people \u2013 from prisoners to pensioners, buggy-pushers to record-breakers \u2013 now signed up to the community event and 4 million having participated. Every week, more than 350,000 people take to their local green space for the free, timed 5km (3.1-mile) parkrun, expecting to reap the health benefits. After its creation in 2004, the first parkrun outside the UK was started in Zimbabwe three years later. In April, Japan became the 21st country to host the event, launching a Tokyo parkrun. Meanwhile, parkrun Russia started with two simultaneous runs in parks in Moscow in March 2014, and there is now an event in Siberia, where organisers have pledged never to let snow, ice or cold weather force them to cancel. In Africa, runners in Eswatini (formerly Swaziland) and South Africa\u2019s vast cities and grasslands are also regulars. The combined distance so far is 162m miles (260m km) at 53.8m parkruns globally, which adds up to 3,118 years, 25 days, 22 hours, 7 minutes and 18 seconds of running and walking. On reaching the milestone, Sinton-Hewitt, who was appointed a CBE for services to grassroots sport participation, said: \u201cWhen I invited my friends to join me in Bushy park [in south-west London] back in October 2004, never in my wildest dreams could I have imagined more than 4 million people would have taken part 15 years later.\u201d For many, the event, entirely organised by volunteers within communities, has changed their lives. Dawn Nisbet from Oldham, who recently completed her 70th parkrun and is a run director for the event, said: \u201cIn April 2016, my stepmother was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. I was also very overweight, completely inactive except walking my two dogs. Being so unfit and unhealthy, my opinion of myself was low, which limited a lot of my activity and self-confidence, but then a friend suggested parkrun. \u201cI\u2019d never heard of it before as, quite frankly, it\u2019s not something I would have ever considered as for me. I researched it on the internet and sent an initial email \u2013 I think if I\u2019m honest, I was hoping they would say, \u2018No, you\u2019re too slow and don\u2019t run the whole 5k, so thanks but no thanks\u2019. But they were wonderful, so welcoming, happy for me to walk the whole thing or whatever suited me.\u201d The NHS assistant director, who has since completed four 10km runs and a half marathon, said she was drawn to the event due to the lack of hierarchy and intensity normally associated with mass participation sporting events. \u201cIt\u2019s not about coming first or winning. You can go at your own pace and just enjoy being with other people. It is so inclusive and the perfect way to start your weekend in the outdoors chatting to people. It has completely changed my outlook on life,\u201d said Nisbet. Of the almost 2,000 parkruns held each week in 21 countries, 25 take place in prisons \u2013 18 in the UK, two in Ireland and five in Australia \u2013 where prisoners and staff often complete multiple laps of an exercise yard to reach 5km. Next week, parkrun will reach another landmark by launching its first prison event in the UK for women only, following the lead of Australia. The fastest recorded time at any parkrun was set in 2012 in Bushy Park by the British Olympian Andy Baddeley, who finished in 13 minutes and 48 seconds. Charlotte Arter set the best women\u2019s time of 15 minutes and 50 seconds in Cardiff in January. Notable participants include the Olympians Jessica Ennis-Hill and Dame Kelly Holmes. But parkrun organisers, who are keen to avoid putting people off with competitive comparisons and are delighted for people to walk the course, do not have a record of the slowest time. Sinton-Hewitt said: \u201cOne of the things that I\u2019m most proud of is that every year the average finish time at parkrun has slowed. That means we are reaching more people for whom physical activity hasn\u2019t been the norm. \u201cI would like to see that continue, and for more people to understand that parkrun is truly welcoming of those who want to walk, jog, run or volunteer, especially those who would like to take their first steps on the path of being physically active.\u201d",

However Lukasz Fabianski is set to be out for three months with a thigh injury and West Ham could suffer without the goalkeeper\u2019s consistency. Crystal Palace, a point behind Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s side, will be keen to find out whether Roberto, Fabianski\u2019s deputy, has the quality to be a regular starter in the Premier League. Palace have problems of their own, with Luka Milivojevic suspended in midfield and centre-back Mamadou Sakho unavailable.

This was back in the day before netting was used between the posts (goalnets weren\u2019t used until the early 1890s), so Dunn\u2019s shots were stopped by an old black shed behind the goal. It was renamed \u201cDunn\u2019s shed\u201d after that match., 2:D - The Barrett brothers \u2013&nbsp;Beauden, Jordie and Scott&nbsp;\u2013 all scored tries for New Zealand in their 63-0 demolition of Canada at the Rugby World Cup. Kevin is their father; he didn\u2019t score against Canada., 3:D - Diaby-Fadiga apologised later, saying he stole the watch \u2013&nbsp;which belonged to Kasper Dolberg and was reportedly worth \u20ac70,000 \u2013&nbsp;becasue he was \u201cjealous\u201d of his more successful teammate. \u201cMy actions were not taken out of an appetite to gain something, but out of disappointment, frustration and feeling discredited. I reimbursed my teammate fully. I wish him a lot of success at Nice and in his career. Maybe one day we will come across each other on a pitch and this affair will be merely a bad memory.\u201d, 4:D - A vendor at the stadium charged the fan $724 for two beers, using a personal card reader that was set up to his own bank. He has since been arrested by police. The fan received a full refund, so effectively had those two beers for free., 5:B - Klopp's rent may go up after this weekend., 6:D - She focused on Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington., 7:D - What a hero., 8:D - Having started on the 5km route for kids, Lovell took a wrong turn and ended up on the 10km course for adults. When he didn\u2019t finish the 5km race, his mother started to panic. \u201cI ran to the finish line and found the coordinators and said someone needs to find him. I\u2019m freaking out, crying, flustered and no one really knows what to do. A fireman is getting ready to search the course when I get a call from my brother-in-law, who tells me there is a cute little kid in a red shirt running the 10K.\", 9:B - The Rangers manager was, of course, talking about his team's opponents in the Europa League., 10:D - Monster Munch are, of course, manufactured by rival company Walkers.</p>\n    <h3 class=\"quiz__scores-title\">Scores</h3>\n    <ol class=\"quiz__scores\" data-result-groups-length=\"11\">\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\"Ah well, have a great weekend\" data-share=\"I scored 1/10 in the Guardian's sports quiz of the week\" data-min-score=\"1\"><p class=\"score__min-score\">1 and above.</p><p class=\"score__title\">Ah well, have a great weekend</p></li>\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\"Ah well, have a great weekend\" data-share=\"I scored 2/10 in the Guardian's sports quiz of the week\" data-min-score=\"2\"><p class=\"score__min-score\">2 and above.</p><p class=\"score__title\">Ah well, have a great weekend</p></li>\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\"Ah well, have a great weekend\" data-share=\"I scored 3/10 in the Guardian's sports quiz of the week\" data-min-score=\"3\"><p class=\"score__min-score\">3 and above.</p><p class=\"score__title\">Ah well, have a great weekend</p></li>\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\"That's a respectable score.

Stop bothering us non-violent<em> </em>protesters; focus instead on those frightening inner-city neighbourhoods, where black children carry knives.</p> <p>\u201cIt was feeding into a racist narrative,\u201d says Guppi Bola, an activist with the Wretched of the Earth, an environmental group that focuses on black, brown and indigenous voices. \u201cWhen those kinds of things come up, then of course you are not going to feel welcome.\u201d</p> <p>In less than a year, Extinction Rebellion (XR) has established itself as one of the UK\u2019s highest-profile environmental campaign groups. Its mass civil disobedience protests have helped raise concern over green issues to <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/06/05/concern-environment-record-highs\">a record high</a>.</p> <p>Its representatives have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/30/extinction-rebellion-tells-politicians-to-declare-emergency\">met </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/30/extinction-rebellion-tells-politicians-to-declare-emergency\">government ministers</a> and <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/business-energy-industrial-strategy/news-parliament-2017/climate-change--net-zero-target-evidence-17-19/\">spoken to MPs</a>. On Monday, it promises to start shutting down Westminster \u201cfor as long as it takes\u201d to achieve its three main goals: for the government to tell the truth about the climate emergency; for the UK to cut its greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2025; and for citizens\u2019 assemblies to devise policy to tackle the crisis.</p> <p>But from the start XR has faced questions over its ability to reach out to diverse communities.

It was a sunny day in July and environmental activists had blocked the Strand with a big blue boat. \u201cLive from the royal courts of justice,\u201d Extinction Rebellion London wrote. \u201cIt has been announced that all protesters arrested during the April rebellion will be prosecuted. We are asking the police and legal system to concentrate on issues such as knife crime, and not non-violent protesters who are trying to save our planet.\u201d For those with ears tuned to hear it, the dogwhistle sounded clear. Stop bothering us non-violent protesters; focus instead on those frightening inner-city neighbourhoods, where black children carry knives. \u201cIt was feeding into a racist narrative,\u201d says Guppi Bola, an activist with the Wretched of the Earth, an environmental group that focuses on black, brown and indigenous voices. \u201cWhen those kinds of things come up, then of course you are not going to feel welcome.\u201d In less than a year, Extinction Rebellion (XR) has established itself as one of the UK\u2019s highest-profile environmental campaign groups. Its mass civil disobedience protests have helped raise concern over green issues to a record high. Its representatives have met government ministers and spoken to MPs. On Monday, it promises to start shutting down Westminster \u201cfor as long as it takes\u201d to achieve its three main goals: for the government to tell the truth about the climate emergency; for the UK to cut its greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2025; and for citizens\u2019 assemblies to devise policy to tackle the crisis. But from the start XR has faced questions over its ability to reach out to diverse communities. Some critics go further, suggesting its tactics, its framing of key issues and a series of communications missteps show a carelessness around issues of race \u2013 or even institutional racism. As climate anxiety increases, XR says it has listened to the criticisms and is prepared to make changes in order to reach as many people as possible. But why is the movement so white? Why is that a problem? And what can be done to change it? XR\u2019s lack of diversity is not unique to the wider environmental movement \u2013 a \u201cwhite middle-class ghetto\u201d, in the words of one NGO chief, with research in 2017 finding the \u201cenvironment profession\u201d \u2013 including workers at green NGOs \u2013 was the second least diverse of all sectors in the UK, after farming. So when a small group of activists got together in a Stroud living room last year to found a radical environmental movement, it was no surprise that they were white, or that they have gone on to create a movement in their own image. With many of its key activists from rural or semi-rural areas, Extinction Rebellion rolls into town like the left wing of the Countryside Alliance. The protest culture of its core supporters is rooted in a new age hippy aesthetic of paisley robes, circus skills, camping, roll-ups and psytrance music. \u201cOutside of environmental thinktanks and environmental organisations, grassroots organising is often very isolating for people of colour, particularly in the kinds of cultures or activities that are decided on,\u201d Bola said. \u201cThey lack inclusive cultures.\u201d Protest groups often meet in pubs, which can be alienating for Muslims, she points out. Actions often involve \u201cconditions people are not very comfortable with\u201d, such as hiking or camping. Britons from an ethnic minority background are less likely to visit the natural world, research suggests \u201cthey might not have the kit\u201d. So while people from black and minority ethnic groups have been spokespeople for XR, and have taken part in actions, Metropolitan police statistics show that nine in 10 of the 1,100 activists arrested in the group\u2019s April protests in London were white \u2013a city in which four in 10 residents are not. A central plank of XR\u2019s campaign strategy is to sacrifice as many activists to arrest as possible. Its supporters use a range of non-violent tactics to cause disruption and gain attention, then \u2013 in contrast to protest movements of the past \u2013 they allow themselves to be arrested without resistance. They believe it is because of that sacrifice \u2013 the willingness to be arrested and go to prison \u2013 that people will take their message seriously. But it is a strategy that many black activists say they cannot adopt. \u201cThe way they conceptualise the police and the state, and being arrested, alienates a lot of people of colour, a lot of migrant people,\u201d said Susuana Amoah, an environmental activist from Brighton who has run workshops on the green movement\u2019s approach to race. \u201cThey have so much faith in the system to be on their side and not send them to prison, or not send them to prison for long. And the bravery around that. People of colour can\u2019t do that. It won\u2019t happen for us. In an open letter published in May, XR was challenged by the Wretched of the Earth to rethink its message and strategy to take into account \u201can ongoing analysis of privilege, as well as the reality of police and state violence\u201d. Bola helped to draft that letter. \u201cI do remember the response from XR\u2019s Twitter \u2026 which was \u2018people of colour are more harshly impacted by a police society and the judicial system and so it is the role of white people to stand up for them and take the lead\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cI was like, \u2018Um, I mean, I guess so\u2019. And I guess in a strategic, well-organised aligned action that would involve people of colour at the start of the decision-making process.\u201d Or, as another activist put it to the Guardian: \u201cInstead of using your privilege to get arrested, how about using it to stop other people getting arrested?\u201d Initial messaging from the group eschewed issues of race or the idea of intersectionality \u2013 where environmental issues are considered in connection with those of race, poverty, class and misogyny \u2013 as divisive and likely to alienate more potential supporters than they would attract. There was an effort to present the environment issue as \u201cbeyond politics\u201d and to use language that could attract those on the right as much as the left. As a result, no one apparently thought to raise the alarm when the committee drafting the group\u2019s founding document \u2013 a \u201cdeclaration of rebellion\u201d read out in Parliament Square last November \u2013 decided it should raise fears of \u201cmass migration\u201d. \u201cThere is a real threat of far-right xenophobia being fuelled through the narrative of climate change,\u201d Bola said. The fear is that such rhetoric could prefigure a populist turn to eco-fascism \u2013 an end that Gail Bradbrook, XR\u2019s co-founder, has said is among her greatest fears for the future. At the core of XR\u2019s message is the idea that humanity is running out of time. \u201cIf we do not act now, we face extinction,\u201d one early press release asserted. \u201cAt the very least we will witness the breakdown of society as we know it.\u201d But as critics have pointed out, the very real effects of climate change and environmental destruction are already being felt by billions of people. \u201cExtraction of the Alberta tar sands has been happening for 50 years,\u201d said Suzanne Dhaliwal, whose No Tar Sands campaign was the first in the UK to highlight the struggles of indigenous people in Canada. \u201cSo when you talk about it as some future situation it means that the responsiveness to climate catastrophes and events isn\u2019t even thought of as part of consciousness work. It\u2019s all about white middle-class people protesting about something that might happen.\u201d Priyamvada Gopal, a University of Cambridge don and antiracism campaigner, said: \u201cThere has certainly been a perception among people of colour that [XR] is white-led and sometimes inadequately cognisant of concerns around race, migration, empire and so on. \u201cHowever, my sense is also that because it is a growing movement that is bringing different kinds of people onboard, particularly younger people, important discussions around race and geopolitics are starting to happen and that is welcome.\u201d One of those younger people is Daze Aghaji.

Around the world it is the poorest and the blackest who are suffering the worst effects of the destruction of the natural world.

      "body": "<p>Few movies in history have had such an extreme pre-release experience.

There\u2019s been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/28/he-is-a-psychopath-has-the-2019-joker-gone-too-far\">no shortage of conversation</a> around Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s movie but until now, as is so often the case online, few people had actually seen it. Until now. Here are the pressing topics, only some of which are worth laughing about.</p> <h2><strong>Is Joker actually a comic book movie?</strong></h2> <p>Todd Phillips, who is as crafty with the press as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mister_Terrific_(Michael_Holt)\">Mr Terrific</a> is with T-Spheres, <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/joker-director-todd-phillips-rebuffs-criticism-of-dark-tone-we-didnt-make-the-movie-to-push-buttons-exclusive/\">has said</a> that he convinced Phoenix to appear in his supervillain origin story by suggesting they would \u201csneak a real movie in the studio system under the guise of a comic-book film\u201d. This does not sound like someone who is particularly enamoured of the genre. \u201cLet\u2019s make a real movie with a real budget and call it fucking Joker,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/joker-director-todd-phillips-rebuffs-criticism-of-dark-tone-we-didnt-make-the-movie-to-push-buttons-exclusive/\">he continued</a>. He\u2019s cited movies by <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/2019/04/robert-de-niro-joker-king-of-comedy-1202055636/\">Martin Scorsese</a> and (surprisingly) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lNLANDEMPlRE/status/1173686506352971776\">Chantal Akerman</a> as influences. So the question is: is this movie <em>really</em> that different?</p> <p>We\u2019ll give Philips the points here. This is lightyears away from zippy, agreeable fare like, say, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/02/ant-man-and-the-wasp-review-buzzing-micro-caper-with-a-sting-in-its-tail\">Ant-Man and the Wasp</a> or Thor: Ragnarok. Even the so-called \u201cgrimdark\u201d superhero movies like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/27/batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice-observer-review\">Batman v Superman</a> or Watchmen feel like an entirely different genre. While Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s Arthur Fleck <em>does</em> paint his face, and eventually masks do come into play, there are no costumes and certainly no stylised slugfests. This is a dark and (eventually) gruesomely violent drama that is nihilistic and performance-driven. It isn\u2019t about special effects.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/31/joker-review-twisted-tour-de-force-joaquin-phoenix\">Joker review \u2013 Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s villain has last laugh in twisted tale</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Comic book enthusiasts will still, however, find a few examples of their beloved DC lore. Arthur Fleck (which is what the Joker is named in this version) pays a visit to Arkham State Hospital, a tweak on the Arkham Asylum from the comics. The more exciting connections come with the Wayne family. For a stretch it is suggested that Thomas Wayne might actually be Arthur\u2019s father. This turns out to be a red herring, but not before Arthur heads up to Wayne Manor and makes contact with the young Bruce Wayne \u2026 who playfully slides down a pole at some point. That\u2019s right \u2013 an ur-Bat Pole! (Note: this is just about the only moment of levity in the entire picture.)</p> <p>During the big climax, we see, once again, Bruce\u2019s parents get killed. In some of these tellings (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/14/90s-batman-movies-tim-burton-joel-schumacher-rereleased\">notably Tim Burton\u2019s version</a>) culpability is laid at Joker\u2019s feet. The new movie offers a clever twist. As the dispossessed citizens of Gotham City rally around Joker as some sort of political hero, it\u2019s just some random thug in a clown mask who kills the famous zillionaires, not Joker himself. (In a nice spin, they are still outside a theatre showing Zorro, but it\u2019s the dopey 1981 comedy Zorro, the Gay Blade.)</p> <h2><strong>Sympathy for the incel</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c69fa0abedbb43bfc179146b8040730540c67548\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c69fa0abedbb43bfc179146b8040730540c67548/0_0_3504_2336/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Triggers \u2026 most of the character\u2019s anger is rooted in circumstance.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Triggers \u2026 most of the character\u2019s anger is rooted in circumstance.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/DC Comics/Warner Bros</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Is this movie really just the biggest-budget <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/video/2019/may/11/us-conservative-pundit-ben-shapiro-ends-interview-with-bbcs-andrew-neil-video\">Ben Shapiro</a> video? To what extent will misogynistic creeps \u201cfeel seen\u201d in this film? Well, for <em>most</em> of its run time, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/02/incel-violence-joker-rightwing-film-joaquin-phoenix\">it isn\u2019t quite the alt-right manifesto some of the pre-release discourse suggested</a>. It\u2019s really just a drama about a mentally ill man with no friends who is targeted by bullies, lives with his mother, is ignored by the attractive woman down the hall and only finds purpose in mass murder.</p> <p>Wait, I know that sounds like it <em>is</em> sympathy for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/25/raw-hatred-why-incel-movement-targets-terrorises-women\">the incel</a>, but Fleck\u2019s anger, for most of the movie, stays rooted in his own circumstances. He isn\u2019t really railing against PC culture or how he\u2019s <em>owed </em>anything, like a guy who won\u2019t stop talking about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/feb/07/how-dangerous-is-jordan-b-peterson-the-rightwing-professor-who-hit-a-hornets-nest\">Jordan Peterson</a>. It\u2019s more of a generic \u201cMy life sucks!\u201d cry than an \u201cOur life sucks, brothers!\u201d</p> <p>In the final reel, though, there is some angry monologuing, and some of those \u201cNobody cares!\u201d talking points come through, but the writing is too vague and incoherent to really land a point.</p> <h2><strong>Awards for Joaquin</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/feb/22/oscars-2009-full-list-of-winners\">Heath Ledger</a> won an Oscar posthumously for playing Joker. Jack Nicholson was nominated for a Bafta and a Golden Globe. Does Joaquin Phoenix have a shot at a statuetee? Anything\u2019s possible, I suppose, but if it were up to me, I would say heck no. I like when awards go to best acting not <em>most</em> acting.</p> <p>Phoenix\u2019s mimicry of the pseudobulbar affect (a psychological disorder that causes uncontrollable laughter, coughs, bleats and whimpers) is accurate, at least based on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uk7MdKMfypM\">one YouTube video</a> I found. But this is a surface thing. There\u2019s little depth to the character other than, you know, <em>he\u2019s nuts</em>! Time Magazine\u2019s Stephanie Zacharek said it best when <a href=\"https://time.com/5666055/venice-joker-review-joaquin-phoenix-not-funny/\">she called him</a> \u201ca chicken bone soaked in Coca-Cola\u201d.</p> <h2>A few great scenes</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c76515db115e121f027dc07cc9a5b5b95d360f49\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c76515db115e121f027dc07cc9a5b5b95d360f49/0_0_3504_2336/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Grit \u2026 Joaquin Phoenix as Joker on the subway.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grit \u2026 Joaquin Phoenix as Joker on the subway.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/DC Comics/Warner Bros</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By now you\u2019ve sussed out that I\u2019m not really a fan of Joker. I mostly found it bleak and juvenile. But it is not without merit. The location photography in Newark, New Jersey and the Bronx captures some real grit. The big finish, while dumb from a story point of view, is marvellously shot. And the big acts of violence are effectively rattling.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/03/joker-review-joaquin-phoenix-todd-phillips\">Joker review \u2013 the most disappointing film of the year</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There\u2019s one moment that shows a true creative spark. Two of Fleck\u2019s old work buddies come to visit him. One (Glenn Fleshler) has long been a jerk, so Fleck, now a killer, stabs him, spraying blood all over the place. The other guy (Leigh Gill), is horrified, but since he was always nice to Fleck, he\u2019s not in danger. Fleck says he can leave and, quaking in terror, Gill heads toward the door. It is, unfortunately, latched from up high and as Gill has dwarfism he can\u2019t reach. It\u2019s absolutely chilling to hear this man ask someone who just butchered a person for help.</p> <p>Part of why this scene works is that it plays to Phillips\u2019s strengths.

      "bodyText": "Few movies in history have had such an extreme pre-release experience. It is almost unheard of for a mainstream Hollywood studio film to win the Venice film festival\u2019s Golden Lion. And it is unheard of for Venice\u2019s winner, usually an erudite art film, to inspire grotesque hate speech from fans on social media should anyone be the least bit critical. A violent look at \u201chow Batman\u2019s foe got that way,\u201d Joker has been hailed as revolutionary for its depiction of mental illness, but \u2013 at least in gun-toting America \u2013 screenings have been suggested as a potential trigger of violence. There\u2019s been no shortage of conversation around Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s movie but until now, as is so often the case online, few people had actually seen it. Until now. Here are the pressing topics, only some of which are worth laughing about. Is Joker actually a comic book movie? Todd Phillips, who is as crafty with the press as Mr Terrific is with T-Spheres, has said that he convinced Phoenix to appear in his supervillain origin story by suggesting they would \u201csneak a real movie in the studio system under the guise of a comic-book film\u201d. This does not sound like someone who is particularly enamoured of the genre. \u201cLet\u2019s make a real movie with a real budget and call it fucking Joker,\u201d he continued. He\u2019s cited movies by Martin Scorsese and (surprisingly) Chantal Akerman as influences. So the question is: is this movie really that different? We\u2019ll give Philips the points here. This is lightyears away from zippy, agreeable fare like, say, Ant-Man and the Wasp or Thor: Ragnarok. Even the so-called \u201cgrimdark\u201d superhero movies like Batman v Superman or Watchmen feel like an entirely different genre. While Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s Arthur Fleck does paint his face, and eventually masks do come into play, there are no costumes and certainly no stylised slugfests. This is a dark and (eventually) gruesomely violent drama that is nihilistic and performance-driven. It isn\u2019t about special effects. Comic book enthusiasts will still, however, find a few examples of their beloved DC lore. Arthur Fleck (which is what the Joker is named in this version) pays a visit to Arkham State Hospital, a tweak on the Arkham Asylum from the comics. The more exciting connections come with the Wayne family. For a stretch it is suggested that Thomas Wayne might actually be Arthur\u2019s father. This turns out to be a red herring, but not before Arthur heads up to Wayne Manor and makes contact with the young Bruce Wayne \u2026 who playfully slides down a pole at some point. That\u2019s right \u2013 an ur-Bat Pole! (Note: this is just about the only moment of levity in the entire picture.) During the big climax, we see, once again, Bruce\u2019s parents get killed. In some of these tellings (notably Tim Burton\u2019s version) culpability is laid at Joker\u2019s feet. The new movie offers a clever twist. As the dispossessed citizens of Gotham City rally around Joker as some sort of political hero, it\u2019s just some random thug in a clown mask who kills the famous zillionaires, not Joker himself. (In a nice spin, they are still outside a theatre showing Zorro, but it\u2019s the dopey 1981 comedy Zorro, the Gay Blade.) Sympathy for the incel Is this movie really just the biggest-budget Ben Shapiro video? To what extent will misogynistic creeps \u201cfeel seen\u201d in this film? Well, for most of its run time, it isn\u2019t quite the alt-right manifesto some of the pre-release discourse suggested. It\u2019s really just a drama about a mentally ill man with no friends who is targeted by bullies, lives with his mother, is ignored by the attractive woman down the hall and only finds purpose in mass murder. Wait, I know that sounds like it is sympathy for the incel, but Fleck\u2019s anger, for most of the movie, stays rooted in his own circumstances. He isn\u2019t really railing against PC culture or how he\u2019s owed anything, like a guy who won\u2019t stop talking about Jordan Peterson. It\u2019s more of a generic \u201cMy life sucks!\u201d cry than an \u201cOur life sucks, brothers!\u201d In the final reel, though, there is some angry monologuing, and some of those \u201cNobody cares!\u201d talking points come through, but the writing is too vague and incoherent to really land a point. Awards for Joaquin Heath Ledger won an Oscar posthumously for playing Joker. Jack Nicholson was nominated for a Bafta and a Golden Globe. Does Joaquin Phoenix have a shot at a statuetee? Anything\u2019s possible, I suppose, but if it were up to me, I would say heck no. I like when awards go to best acting not most acting. Phoenix\u2019s mimicry of the pseudobulbar affect (a psychological disorder that causes uncontrollable laughter, coughs, bleats and whimpers) is accurate, at least based on one YouTube video I found. But this is a surface thing. There\u2019s little depth to the character other than, you know, he\u2019s nuts! Time Magazine\u2019s Stephanie Zacharek said it best when she called him \u201ca chicken bone soaked in Coca-Cola\u201d. A few great scenes By now you\u2019ve sussed out that I\u2019m not really a fan of Joker. I mostly found it bleak and juvenile. But it is not without merit. The location photography in Newark, New Jersey and the Bronx captures some real grit. The big finish, while dumb from a story point of view, is marvellously shot. And the big acts of violence are effectively rattling. There\u2019s one moment that shows a true creative spark. Two of Fleck\u2019s old work buddies come to visit him. One (Glenn Fleshler) has long been a jerk, so Fleck, now a killer, stabs him, spraying blood all over the place. The other guy (Leigh Gill), is horrified, but since he was always nice to Fleck, he\u2019s not in danger. Fleck says he can leave and, quaking in terror, Gill heads toward the door. It is, unfortunately, latched from up high and as Gill has dwarfism he can\u2019t reach. It\u2019s absolutely chilling to hear this man ask someone who just butchered a person for help. Part of why this scene works is that it plays to Phillips\u2019s strengths. While it keeps Gill\u2019s dignity intact (he\u2019s one of the few nice people in the film) it\u2019s still a bit of business that finds humour in interaction with dwarfism. For better or worse, that\u2019s the kind of thing Phillips built his career on with bro comedies like The Hangover. It\u2019s sure footing for him, far less so than nihilistic drama. Unnecessary Glitter Once Joker has more than a few kills under his belt, he heads into Robert De Niro\u2019s TV studio for his big catharsis. There\u2019s a psych-up scene as he dances outside his apartment, so there\u2019s a pop song needle-drop. Phillips chooses Gary Glitter\u2019s Rock and Roll Part 2. It\u2019s a song you absolutely know, even if the title doesn\u2019t ring a bell. More to the point, especially from a guy recently quoted as saying that \u201cwoke culture\u201d has torn him away from comedy, it\u2019s a song recorded by a convicted child sex offender. Todd Phillips really is a troll.",

      "body": "<p>Shakespeare\u2019s King John is rarely performed but, on the basis of <a href=\"https://www.rsc.org.uk/king-john/cast-and-creatives\">Eleanor Rhode\u2019s engrossing production for the RSC</a>, it absolutely should be. The plot initially sounds a bit pedestrian: King John of England and the King of France battle for power, forge a tentative truce, and fight a whole lot more. But what a play this is: there are endless thrilling fights, spellbinding moments of reflection and devastating outpourings of grief. There is also a gradual erosion of belief in any sort of greater good as the divine right of kings and divinity itself fade away in the heat of battle.</p> <p>Designer Max Johns has talked about approaching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jun/20/josie-rourke-shakespeare-king-john\">King John</a> as a new play and the production tingles with a tangible sense of spontaneity. The show is loosely located in the mid 20th century but the set and costumes grow heavier and older \u2013 disco lights replaced with flickering candles \u2013 as the political squabbling turns deadly. There is jaunty dancing between the scenes, endless fashion parades (peaking with Katherine Pearce\u2019s gold-decked Cardinal) and the mother of all food fights. Weaving everything together is David Gregory\u2019s enveloping sound design, which gradually darkens as blood begins to spill.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9af1c8b8b840b1f9933c8c54dc2f4c4cd5091bf6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9af1c8b8b840b1f9933c8c54dc2f4c4cd5091bf6/0_0_6923_4558/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Katherine Pearce as the Cardinal in King John.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"658\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spellbinding \u2026 Katherine Pearce as the Cardinal in King John.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Tanner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All these flourishes keep the energy pulsing but they also carry an important message: here is politics as performance. The connection is amplified by the fact that King John is played, brilliantly, by a woman. Rosie Sheehy portrays the King as a preening peacock, always on show when in public. When John addresses the citizens of Angers and implores them to recognise England\u2019s authority, the crowd munches on popcorn, spectators to their own downfall.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jun/20/josie-rourke-shakespeare-king-john\">Shakespeare's 'Brexit play': Josie Rourke on King John</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As John\u2019s power wanes, Rhode expertly emphasises the personal cost of politics.

      "bodyText": "Shakespeare\u2019s King John is rarely performed but, on the basis of Eleanor Rhode\u2019s engrossing production for the RSC, it absolutely should be. The plot initially sounds a bit pedestrian: King John of England and the King of France battle for power, forge a tentative truce, and fight a whole lot more. But what a play this is: there are endless thrilling fights, spellbinding moments of reflection and devastating outpourings of grief. There is also a gradual erosion of belief in any sort of greater good as the divine right of kings and divinity itself fade away in the heat of battle. Designer Max Johns has talked about approaching King John as a new play and the production tingles with a tangible sense of spontaneity. The show is loosely located in the mid 20th century but the set and costumes grow heavier and older \u2013 disco lights replaced with flickering candles \u2013 as the political squabbling turns deadly. There is jaunty dancing between the scenes, endless fashion parades (peaking with Katherine Pearce\u2019s gold-decked Cardinal) and the mother of all food fights. Weaving everything together is David Gregory\u2019s enveloping sound design, which gradually darkens as blood begins to spill. All these flourishes keep the energy pulsing but they also carry an important message: here is politics as performance. The connection is amplified by the fact that King John is played, brilliantly, by a woman. Rosie Sheehy portrays the King as a preening peacock, always on show when in public. When John addresses the citizens of Angers and implores them to recognise England\u2019s authority, the crowd munches on popcorn, spectators to their own downfall. As John\u2019s power wanes, Rhode expertly emphasises the personal cost of politics. Charlotte Randle initially plays Constance as a crazed stage mum, but after her son is imprisoned she implodes with a grief that hollows out the theatre. John\u2019s garments grow ever more oppressive until they\u2019re eventually removed. All that pomp and ceremony melts away and the King is left in rags, vomiting blood in a rusty bathtub. As Philip the Bastard says: \u201cMad world! Mad kings! Mad composition!\u201d At the Swan theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, until 21 March. In cinemas 29 April.",

On the contrary, the young Turk has defended with admirable assertiveness, commanding in the air and vigilant in his marking and tackling. And his elan on the ball flirts with the outrageous. Rodgers said this season that the player needs to measure his risk-taking but, at the same time, the manager could not help grinning as he referred to the \u201cwee maverick things\u201d that Soyuncu likes to do: highlights from this season include dribbling past Bournemouth\u2019s Callum and Harry Wilson in his own area or dancing around Tanguy Ndomb\u00e9l\u00e9 in a way that left Tottenham\u2019s record signing sprawled on the grass like a sprinter who trod on a roller skate. Leicester fans have fallen in love.</p> \n<p>Soyuncu still needs a little refinement, of course. The only game Leicester have lost this season was, ironically, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/14/manchester-united-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">to Manchester United</a>, where Marcus Rashford lured Soyuncu into conceding a penalty. The evidence so far suggests that Rodgers and Evans will help the centre-back to become more accomplished without losing his personality. The Leicester coach Kolo Tour\u00e9 will surely also have good counsel to give on that front.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"35e80c3466b07edb06a2c70de1b31d6cd165f355\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/35e80c3466b07edb06a2c70de1b31d6cd165f355/0_107_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ricardo Pereira\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ricardo Pereira celebrates his goal against Newcastle.

Chilwell, at 22, is an exceptionally mature left-back, assured in defence and constantly dangerous going forward. Pereira, too, has quickly proven to be top class. A year ago, right-back was a problem position for Leicester, and Pereira, a \u00a321m recruit from Porto, did not look like the solution. He was so much at sea during a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/sep/15/bournemouth-leicester-city-premier-league-report\" title=\"\">4-2 defeat at Bournemouth</a> in September 2018 that one could have concluded that if he were to have a future in the Premier League, it would only be as a wing-back or a midfielder. But the Portuguese soon adapted, demonstrated defensive nous to go with his offensive excellence, and ended up being voted Leicester\u2019s player of the season.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c4498da2-836f-4eda-adaa-295d7208fe62\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>2012-13</b></p>\n    <p>Rodgers tells fans&nbsp;he\u2019ll \u201cleave no stone&nbsp;unturned in my&nbsp;quest.

But the style introduced by the former Celtic manager, and the increased fitness he has demanded, are even more suited to Pereira and the rest of Leicester\u2019s young team. The aggressive, co-ordinated pressing \u2013 \u201cdefending forward\u201d, as Rodgers often calls it \u2013 allows the whole team to work in sync and usually on the front foot. That is part what makes them, and Liverpool, so exciting to watch and so formidable to play against.</p> \n<p>Saturday\u2019s showdown at Anfield promises to be an all-action contest between two creative and devoutly attacking teams, yet each defence is so strong that there may not be many goals.</p>",

After his first match this term \u2013 the 0-0 draw with Wolves \u2013 he was flawless and returned to the dressing room to be greeted with a standing ovation from his teammates. The other players knew the pressure that the 23-year-old had been under as the world watched to see how Leicester would cope without Maguire. Their applause showed he had earned the players\u2019 confidence and they wanted to give him some back. There has been no trace of impostor syndrome from Soyuncu. On the contrary, the young Turk has defended with admirable assertiveness, commanding in the air and vigilant in his marking and tackling. And his elan on the ball flirts with the outrageous. Rodgers said this season that the player needs to measure his risk-taking but, at the same time, the manager could not help grinning as he referred to the \u201cwee maverick things\u201d that Soyuncu likes to do: highlights from this season include dribbling past Bournemouth\u2019s Callum and Harry Wilson in his own area or dancing around Tanguy Ndomb\u00e9l\u00e9 in a way that left Tottenham\u2019s record signing sprawled on the grass like a sprinter who trod on a roller skate. Leicester fans have fallen in love. Soyuncu still needs a little refinement, of course. The only game Leicester have lost this season was, ironically, to Manchester United, where Marcus Rashford lured Soyuncu into conceding a penalty. The evidence so far suggests that Rodgers and Evans will help the centre-back to become more accomplished without losing his personality. The Leicester coach Kolo Tour\u00e9 will surely also have good counsel to give on that front. Of course, even before the arrival of Rodgers in February, Leicester was a place where players progressed quickly. Chilwell, at 22, is an exceptionally mature left-back, assured in defence and constantly dangerous going forward. Pereira, too, has quickly proven to be top class. A year ago, right-back was a problem position for Leicester, and Pereira, a \u00a321m recruit from Porto, did not look like the solution. He was so much at sea during a 4-2 defeat at Bournemouth in September 2018 that one could have concluded that if he were to have a future in the Premier League, it would only be as a wing-back or a midfielder. But the Portuguese soon adapted, demonstrated defensive nous to go with his offensive excellence, and ended up being voted Leicester\u2019s player of the season. That vindicated Claude Puel, Rodgers\u2019s predecessor who had worked with Pereira at Nice before bringing him to Leicester. But the style introduced by the former Celtic manager, and the increased fitness he has demanded, are even more suited to Pereira and the rest of Leicester\u2019s young team. The aggressive, co-ordinated pressing \u2013 \u201cdefending forward\u201d, as Rodgers often calls it \u2013 allows the whole team to work in sync and usually on the front foot. That is part what makes them, and Liverpool, so exciting to watch and so formidable to play against. Saturday\u2019s showdown at Anfield promises to be an all-action contest between two creative and devoutly attacking teams, yet each defence is so strong that there may not be many goals.",

      "bodyText": "The senior White House adviser Stephen Miller recently claimed the impeachment inquiry imperilling Donald Trump\u2019s presidency was a product of the \u201cdeep state\u201d, a conspiracy theory which holds that a permanent government of civil servants and security operatives exists to thwart the will of the people. But according to Steve Bannon, Trump\u2019s former 2016 campaign chair and White House strategist, a prime mover in the formation and propagation of the deep state conspiracy theory, it should not be taken seriously. Bannon states his opinion in a new book, Deep State: Trump, the FBI and the Rule of Law by James B Stewart, which will be published on 8 October. The Guardian obtained a copy. The \u201cdeep state conspiracy theory is for nut cases\u201d, Bannon is quoted as saying, because \u201cAmerica isn\u2019t Turkey or Egypt\u201d. There is a formidable government bureaucracy in the US, he adds, but \u201cthere\u2019s nothing \u2018deep\u2019 about it. It\u2019s right in your face.\u201d Bannon, a leading voice of the alt-right, left the White House in August 2017, after the president\u2019s handling of the deadly far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, came under fierce criticism. In August, an unidentified member of the intelligence services filed a whistleblower\u2019s complaint about Trump\u2019s behaviour. It was processed through official channels, then withheld from Congress. On 25 September, after the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, announced an impeachment inquiry, the complaint was released. It detailed concern over Trump\u2019s behaviour towards Ukraine, withholding military aid and asking for help in attempts to damage Joe Biden, a leading Democratic rival. Trump has furiously demanded the identity of the whistleblower be revealed and insinuated that he or she should be punished with death. Last weekend, as Trump surrogates joined in the furious offensive, Miller told Fox News Sunday he knew \u201cthe difference between a whistleblower and a deep state operative\u201d. Much of the deep state conspiracy theory\u2019s power in US politics under Trump has been generated by the far-right Breitbart website, which Bannon ran before joining the 2016 Trump campaign and after his time in the White House. On Thursday, Breitbart published a new essay by Virgil, the pseudonymous author of the original Deep State series. The title: Lessons of Impeachment, from Watergate to Monicagate to Bidengate. In it, the author quoted Bannon, and added: \u201cYes, this is the deep state in action, and it\u2019s out for blood.\u201d Bannon lost his role at Breitbart in January 2018, after the publication of Michael Wolff\u2019s book Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, in which he was quoted liberally. Amid reports that he could yet return to Trump\u2019s side, Bannon continues to fight over old ground. Miller was formerly an aide to Jeff Sessions, Trump\u2019s first attorney general and a frequent target of Trump\u2019s ire. Among headline-grabbing shots loosed off in his conversations with Stewart, Bannon says he thought the firing of FBI director James Comey \u2013 supposedly a particularly malevolent deep state operator \u2013 was \u201cmaybe\u201d the biggest mistake \u201cin modern political history\u201d. This is not a new claim from Bannon, who told Wolff he told the president firing Comey would make the investigation of Russian election interference and links between Trump and Moscow \u201cthe biggest story in the world\u201d. Bannon has reportedly asserted the deep state is false before. In Wolff\u2019s follow-up book, Siege: Trump Under Fire, Bannon describes advice he gave to a ghost writer working on Trump\u2019s Enemies: How the Deep State is Undermining the Presidency, a book by Trump allies Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie.

Eurydice, played by <a href=\"https://www.intermusica.co.uk/artist/Mary-Bevan\">Mary Bevan</a>, is imprisoned in a celestial boudoir while the gods jostle to have their wicked way with her. Within minutes, the captivating heroine is frolicking on a bed \u2013 with a fly. She is rapturously unaware that the insect is Jupiter\u2019s alter ego, and that the god is looming lustfully over her. \u201cWhen I wiggle my bum, my little wings begin to hum,\u201d sings <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jul/11/willard-white-othello-rsc-trevor-nunn-shakespeare\">Willard White</a> as the uber-deity, with a pert little shimmy of his hips.</p> <p>It\u2019s all very silly but also more than a little bit creepy, not least because Jupiter looks old enough to be Eurydice\u2019s grandfather. Given that the fly is a puppet that buzzes around on the end of a stick, it\u2019s also very Emma Rice. But is it Offenbach? That is the question opera-goers will be asking as they head to English National Opera for this second instalment of a season investigating the myth of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/oct/02/orpheus-and-eurydice-review-wayne-mcgregor-eno-coliseum\">Orpheus and Eurydice</a>.</p> <p>Rice answers the question of faithfulness with two words: \u201cWhich text?\u201d After agreeing to take on the production, the director found herself with nine different versions on CD. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a definitive text. Offenbach himself did a two-act version and a four-act one, and there have been many other interpretations, so what I didn\u2019t have was a clear starting point.

      "body": "<h2><strong>Monday</strong></h2> <p>All party conferences feel as if they exist in their own inward-looking world, but this year\u2019s Conservative bash was more dystopian than most. The main hall was an energy-free zone where speaker after speaker appeared to have been given instructions to be as mediocre as possible. The audience couldn\u2019t even get animated when Priti Patel promised to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/01/priti-patel-unveils-county-lines-crackdown\">crack down</a> on criminals, something that is usually guaranteed to get members stamping their feet. Then again, with one Tory MP, Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/01/police-called-tory-conference-mp-geoffrey-clifton-brown\">slung out</a> of the conference centre by police after holding a one-man siege of the international lounge moments before the home secretary\u2019s speech, Boris Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/03/sadiq-khan-boris-johnson-conflict-of-interest-probe-will-be-independent\">facing an inquiry</a> into alleged misuse of public funds during his friendship with Jennifer Arcuri, the government having been found to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/sep/24/boris-johnsons-suspension-of-parliament-unlawful-supreme-court-rules-prorogue\">acted unlawfully</a> in regard to the recent prorogation and ministers actively working on ways to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/02/dominic-cummings-accused-of-lying-to-undermine-mps-boris-johnson-benn-act-pmqs\">avoid complying</a> with the Benn act, the Tories had to be careful about who they wanted to clamp down on. Outside the hall, the exhibition was most notable for a stand selling tinned fish \u2013 ideal for stockpiling \u2013 and one promoting the Cayman Islands as a holiday destination. Come for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/28/uk-and-territories-are-greatest-enabler-of-tax-avoidance-study-says\">tax avoidance</a>, stay for the turtles. With almost no backbench MPs present \u2013 only lobbyists and the odd diehard member bother to turn up \u2013 the main goal of ministers was to get through the four days without putting their foot in it by letting on that they didn\u2019t have a clue what the Brexit plan was or saying the wrong thing. Not all managed it. Having already had his headline announcement of 40 new hospitals <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/29/from-40-hospitals-to-six-tories-nhs-numbers-dont-add-up\">knocked back</a> to six partial refurbs, Matt Hancock, who never knowingly commits himself to a position that can\u2019t be reversed, made the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/29/no-10-denies-claims-boris-johnson-squeezed-thigh-journalist-charlotte-edwardes\">schoolboy error</a> of saying he believed Charlotte Edwardes, the journalist who made the groping allegations against the prime minister. The health secretary looked desperate for days after. Still, the conference turned a tidy profit for the Tories, so job done with an election looming.</p> <h2><strong>Tuesday</strong></h2> <p>One bonus of being in Manchester for the Tory conference that I hadn\u2019t anticipated was missing Spurs\u2019 Champions League tie against Bayern Munich. Before the game, I had been gutted to have had to sell my ticket. After, not so much, though there has been a lot of disinformation about the result in the media. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/01/tottenham-hotspur-bayern-munich-champions-league-match-report\">7-2 defeat</a> wasn\u2019t Tottenham\u2019s worst result at home in Europe. That came in 1995 when we lost 8-0 to Cologne in the Intertoto Cup. Admittedly, we were then actively trying to get knocked out of the competition by fielding a team of 13-year-olds, but one must be accurate about these things and, under the circumstances, a five-goal thrashing was almost respectable. I later spoke to the friend who had gone to the game in my place and he was completely shellshocked. He described it as watching Bayern scoring the same goal over and over again while the Spurs defence just looked on. We\u2019ve all seen games where Spurs are completely clueless and are incapable of making even the simplest pass, but this was the first time he had seen the team actually just give up. I had been hoping for so much more after Tottenham\u2019s gutsy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/28/tottenham-southampton-premier-league-match-report\">2-1 win</a> the previous week, in which they had come back from having a player sent off for two yellow cards in three minutes \u2013 so brainlessly Spurs \u2013 and the goalkeeper letting the ball trickle through his legs for the Southampton goal. Not that you would have known Spurs had been fighting a rearguard action from the highlights shown on the big screen at half-time. From watching those, you would have imagined Spurs were 2-0 up, had 11 men on the field and were in cruise control. It was revisionism worthy of a party conference. Next home game, I\u2019m fully expecting to find Tottenham actually beat Bayern 2-0.</p> <h2><strong>Wednesday</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s almost as if the governing body of world athletics has a death wish. I\u2019m sure all the right people got the relevant money, but holding the World Championships in 40-degree heat in Doha has been a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/30/doha-world-athletics-championships-crowds-iaaf\">miserable experience</a> for athletes and TV viewers alike. Dina Asher-Smith and Katarina Johnson-Thompson should have been celebrating their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/03/katarina-johnson-thompson-british-record-heptathlon-gold\">gold medals</a> in front of 60,000 people rather than a near-empty stadium where the media outnumbered the spectators. I could swear there were more people watching when my children used to compete in under-15 events for Herne Hill Harriers in south London. However, I couldn\u2019t help but be impressed by Asher-Smith\u2019s mother bribing her with Chanel handbags and computer games to persevere with athletics as a teenager. It put my efforts to shame. In a parallel world, I would have been another Steve Ovett \u2013 never Seb Coe, I was probably one of the few Britons willing him not to win \u2013 but lack of talent and a large quantity of drugs rather put paid to that dream. I did take up running more seriously in my 30s, taking part in 5k and 10k races, but by then it was all too late. So I was determined my kids were going to live the life I missed out on and forced them down to Tooting Bec athletics track every Tuesday and Thursday evening for training and to competitions at the weekend. This went on for several years, but was an unmitigated disaster even though they were both quite good. Both children hated it and Anna was the only athlete I knew who would invariably declare she had injured herself in the warm-ups.</p> <h2><strong>Thursday</strong></h2> <p>There are days when the only reasonable explanation for the behaviour of some MPs is that they have taken large quantities of hallucinogens to see what fantasy they can believe in now. This was one such day. In the House of Commons, Boris Johnson was presenting his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/02/boris-johnsons-brexit-alternative-to-the-irish-backstop-whats-new\">new alternative</a> to the Northern Ireland backstop \u2013 two borders rather than one, customs checks carried out by badgers in night-vision goggles, a de facto veto of any arrangement by the Democratic Unionist party and a system that guarantees all sides in Northern Ireland row about its future every four years, because that\u2019s always worked out so well in the past \u2013 and Tory MPs were queueing up to award the prime minister a Nobel peace prize for his ingenuity. Though not quite all Tory MPs. Theresa May sat there impassive for the best part of an hour, her face a mixture of despair and disgust. Johnson\u2019s plan was pretty much the alternative arrangements of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/28/brexit-backstop-amendment-would-give-may-enormous-firepower\">Brady amendment</a> she had never bothered to present to the EU as they self-evidently failed to respect both the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/08/johnson-has-reneged-on-good-friday-agreement-vows-says-eu\">Good Friday </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/08/johnson-has-reneged-on-good-friday-agreement-vows-says-eu\">agreement</a> and the need for no customs checks. Predictably, everywhere outside the confines of the Conservative party, newly reunited with its European Research Group paramilitary wing, the DUP and a handful of Labour MPs desperate to vote for a deal \u2013 even a worse one than that which they had previously rejected \u2013 Johnson\u2019s new proposal was politely, and not so politely, dismissed. We\u2019ve reached the point where the only deal acceptable to the government and for which there is a majority in parliament is one that is dead on arrival.</p> <h2><strong>Friday</strong></h2> <p>Connor Spear, a 19-year-old with the nickname \u201cFun-time Frankie\u201d, mislaid his car for a week, having forgotten where he parked it before a weekend festival in Bristol. He was only reunited with the vehicle after a man phoned to say he had been cycling past the car every day. I regret to say that my wife and I can rather improve on that. And we can\u2019t even claim alcohol as an excuse. Several years ago, having not used the car for some days, I couldn\u2019t remember where we had parked it. Having looked in all the normal places outside the front door, I did a search of the neighbouring streets. No joy. So I could only conclude it had been stolen, though why anyone would have wanted to nick a tatty 15-year-old Toyota Yaris rather escaped me. But I nonetheless reported the car stolen to the police and the insurance company and left it at that. Six weeks later, days before we were due to collect our \u00a3450 insurance payout, I got a phone call from the police. The car had been found just outside the local Budgens about half a mile from our house. My wife and I crept up the road to investigate and were horrified to discover there were no signs of the Yaris having been broken into or dumped. We could only conclude we must have stopped off at Budgens on the way home from somewhere, forgotten we had come by car after we had done our shopping, and walked home. Since then, we must both have walked past the car countless times without noticing. My subsequent phone call to the insurance company was one of the more embarrassing I have ever made.</p> <h2>Digested week, digested: the blame game begins</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c8157af85f2b893c6581036824bc95e8257749d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8157af85f2b893c6581036824bc95e8257749d4/0_158_4758_2855/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson rolls up his sleeve\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris at his computer: \u2018Quick recycle of my Telegraph columns, and I\u2019ll knock this speech out in an hour.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae8f04d6538073f041cc6164759b4a1a87dbb544\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae8f04d6538073f041cc6164759b4a1a87dbb544/0_189_4382_2629/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dominic Cummings\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dominic Cummings: \u2018The Unhappy Mondays.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Veysey/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>",

      "bodyText": "Monday All party conferences feel as if they exist in their own inward-looking world, but this year\u2019s Conservative bash was more dystopian than most. The main hall was an energy-free zone where speaker after speaker appeared to have been given instructions to be as mediocre as possible. The audience couldn\u2019t even get animated when Priti Patel promised to crack down on criminals, something that is usually guaranteed to get members stamping their feet. Then again, with one Tory MP, Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, being slung out of the conference centre by police after holding a one-man siege of the international lounge moments before the home secretary\u2019s speech, Boris Johnson facing an inquiry into alleged misuse of public funds during his friendship with Jennifer Arcuri, the government having been found to have acted unlawfully in regard to the recent prorogation and ministers actively working on ways to avoid complying with the Benn act, the Tories had to be careful about who they wanted to clamp down on. Outside the hall, the exhibition was most notable for a stand selling tinned fish \u2013 ideal for stockpiling \u2013 and one promoting the Cayman Islands as a holiday destination. Come for the tax avoidance, stay for the turtles. With almost no backbench MPs present \u2013 only lobbyists and the odd diehard member bother to turn up \u2013 the main goal of ministers was to get through the four days without putting their foot in it by letting on that they didn\u2019t have a clue what the Brexit plan was or saying the wrong thing. Not all managed it. Having already had his headline announcement of 40 new hospitals knocked back to six partial refurbs, Matt Hancock, who never knowingly commits himself to a position that can\u2019t be reversed, made the schoolboy error of saying he believed Charlotte Edwardes, the journalist who made the groping allegations against the prime minister. The health secretary looked desperate for days after. Still, the conference turned a tidy profit for the Tories, so job done with an election looming. Tuesday One bonus of being in Manchester for the Tory conference that I hadn\u2019t anticipated was missing Spurs\u2019 Champions League tie against Bayern Munich. Before the game, I had been gutted to have had to sell my ticket. After, not so much, though there has been a lot of disinformation about the result in the media. The 7-2 defeat wasn\u2019t Tottenham\u2019s worst result at home in Europe. That came in 1995 when we lost 8-0 to Cologne in the Intertoto Cup. Admittedly, we were then actively trying to get knocked out of the competition by fielding a team of 13-year-olds, but one must be accurate about these things and, under the circumstances, a five-goal thrashing was almost respectable. I later spoke to the friend who had gone to the game in my place and he was completely shellshocked. He described it as watching Bayern scoring the same goal over and over again while the Spurs defence just looked on. We\u2019ve all seen games where Spurs are completely clueless and are incapable of making even the simplest pass, but this was the first time he had seen the team actually just give up. I had been hoping for so much more after Tottenham\u2019s gutsy 2-1 win the previous week, in which they had come back from having a player sent off for two yellow cards in three minutes \u2013 so brainlessly Spurs \u2013 and the goalkeeper letting the ball trickle through his legs for the Southampton goal. Not that you would have known Spurs had been fighting a rearguard action from the highlights shown on the big screen at half-time. From watching those, you would have imagined Spurs were 2-0 up, had 11 men on the field and were in cruise control. It was revisionism worthy of a party conference. Next home game, I\u2019m fully expecting to find Tottenham actually beat Bayern 2-0. Wednesday It\u2019s almost as if the governing body of world athletics has a death wish. I\u2019m sure all the right people got the relevant money, but holding the World Championships in 40-degree heat in Doha has been a miserable experience for athletes and TV viewers alike.

It was once a thriving mining town, but now its population has been reduced to 500. One day a convoy of grey vehicles arrives, only to mysteriously vanish. They are followed by a creeping mist haunted by the ghosts of the town\u2019s dead; citizens who venture outside in darkness are taken by the mist, never to be seen again. Soon the population of Nebulah stands at a mere six benighted souls, the derelict and downtrodden, who have their own reasons to remain. Narrated by Pete McIntosh, a flawed but likable washed-up ex-cop, this story of low-key horror and creeping paranoia follows the fate of the last half dozen to its devastating climax. Winner of the prestigious Australian Aurealis award for the best horror novel of 2017, <em>Soon</em> is a penetrating psychological study of desperate characters existing on the edge of society, and their struggle to retain a semblance of humanity in the face of an unknown terror.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"9ff1febbb5904f2bb86c295330ca84de46ef1890\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ff1febbb5904f2bb86c295330ca84de46ef1890/0_0_344_499/344.jpg\" alt=\"After the Flood\" width=\"344\" height=\"499\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In Kassandra Montag\u2019s first novel, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/after-the-flood-9780008319557.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><strong>After the Flood</strong> </a>(Borough, \u00a312.99), it\u2019s the year 2130 and global heating has taken its inevitable toll. Rising sea levels have inundated the continents and what was once the US is now a string of small islands. Some survivors eke out a subsistence living on land, while others have taken to the seas, where life is even more precarious. Myra and her daughter Pearl are among the latter, trading the fish they catch while attempting to avoid pirates, who treat women like cattle. Seven years earlier, Myra\u2019s husband abducted her younger daughter Rowena, and Myra\u2019s life since then has been a constant, heartbreaking search for the girl. When Myra hears a rumour that Rowena might be living in remote Greenland, she persuades a ship\u2019s captain to take her on the long voyage north. Montag balances graphically rendered set-piece adventures with a moving account of a mother\u2019s love as Myra, resilient yet vulnerable, faces triumphs and setbacks on her perilous quest to reclaim her daughter. By turns bleak and uplifting, this is a refreshingly original take on the dystopian post-apocalyptic subgenre.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"cec7b40f19a174084925780254e896119fd022a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cec7b40f19a174084925780254e896119fd022a1/0_0_191_293/191.jpg\" alt=\"Ninth House\" width=\"191\" height=\"293\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Alex Stern, protagonist of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/ninth-house-9781473227965.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><strong>Ninth House </strong>(Gollancz, \u00a316.99)</a>, Leigh Bardugo\u2019s first novel for adults, is not your average Yale student. The wayward daughter of LA hippies, Alex is a vulnerable high-school drop-out with a history of drug abuse. She also possesses unique supernatural abilities, which is why she was offered a place at the university. Alex becomes one of the guardians of Lethe House, a secret society monitoring the dark goings-on in the eight other Houses, which are run by a privileged elite inclined to occult excess. When a student is murdered, she uncovers a web of terror and abuse. <em>Ninth House</em> is a timely exploration of the use and abuse of power and a gut-churning thriller that pulls no punches, with a strong female lead and a headlong plot.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"4f6c393a3b7fa47d52137c9f5929e6599ae08c6a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f6c393a3b7fa47d52137c9f5929e6599ae08c6a/0_0_326_499/326.jpg\" alt=\"Salvation Lost\" width=\"326\" height=\"499\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In the first book of the Salvation series, Peter F Hamilton introduced a large cast scattered across a sprawling galaxy-wide utopia threatened by an enigmatic alien race.

We follow many <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/sep/07/science-fiction-novels-review-roundup\" title=\"\">characters from volume one</a>, as well as a host of new faces, as the human race joins forces with benevolent extraterrestrials, the Ne\u00e1na, and works to save itself from the malign Olyix, who are intent on harvesting Homo sapiens as offerings to their god. Hamilton excels at interweaving the narratives of multiple viewpoint characters without once relaxing narrative impetus, combining time-lines to great dramatic effect and telling a tense hi-tech story that never loses sight of the human element. Best read after the opening volume, <em>Salvation Lost</em> is action-oriented hardcore science fiction at its page-turning best.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"87b1e8cf719b7ac2e3dca1955d69d03f6fad1ae1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/87b1e8cf719b7ac2e3dca1955d69d03f6fad1ae1/0_0_338_499/338.jpg\" alt=\"The Remaking\" width=\"338\" height=\"499\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Loosely based on the killings of a mother and daughter accused of witchcraft, Clay McLeod Chapman\u2019s <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-remaking-9781683691570.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><strong>The Remaking</strong> </a>(Quirk, \u00a39.99) retells and recasts the real events in a series of connected episodes. When Ella Louise Ford and her daughter Jessica were burned as witches in Pilot\u2019s Creek, Virginia, in 1931, the murders and the stories of the subsequent ghostly hauntings echoed down the years. In 1971 the story is made into a low-budget horror film starring nine-year-old Amber Pendleton in the part of Jessica, a role that will haunt her for the rest of her life. In 1995 the original film is remade, with a washed-up, drug-addicted Amber this time playing the part of Jessica\u2019s mother. The story jumps to 2016, when the director of a podcast travels to Pilot\u2019s Creek to track down Amber and investigate the events of 1931. Chapman uses an array of narrative techniques in an ambitious mosaic novel exploring the power of urban myth and superstition.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Eric Brown\u2019s latest novel is Murder Served Cold (Severn House).</em></p>",

Soon the population of Nebulah stands at a mere six benighted souls, the derelict and downtrodden, who have their own reasons to remain. Narrated by Pete McIntosh, a flawed but likable washed-up ex-cop, this story of low-key horror and creeping paranoia follows the fate of the last half dozen to its devastating climax. Winner of the prestigious Australian Aurealis award for the best horror novel of 2017, Soon is a penetrating psychological study of desperate characters existing on the edge of society, and their struggle to retain a semblance of humanity in the face of an unknown terror. In Kassandra Montag\u2019s first novel, After the Flood (Borough, \u00a312.99), it\u2019s the year 2130 and global heating has taken its inevitable toll. Rising sea levels have inundated the continents and what was once the US is now a string of small islands. Some survivors eke out a subsistence living on land, while others have taken to the seas, where life is even more precarious. Myra and her daughter Pearl are among the latter, trading the fish they catch while attempting to avoid pirates, who treat women like cattle. Seven years earlier, Myra\u2019s husband abducted her younger daughter Rowena, and Myra\u2019s life since then has been a constant, heartbreaking search for the girl. When Myra hears a rumour that Rowena might be living in remote Greenland, she persuades a ship\u2019s captain to take her on the long voyage north. Montag balances graphically rendered set-piece adventures with a moving account of a mother\u2019s love as Myra, resilient yet vulnerable, faces triumphs and setbacks on her perilous quest to reclaim her daughter. By turns bleak and uplifting, this is a refreshingly original take on the dystopian post-apocalyptic subgenre. Alex Stern, protagonist of Ninth House (Gollancz, \u00a316.99), Leigh Bardugo\u2019s first novel for adults, is not your average Yale student. The wayward daughter of LA hippies, Alex is a vulnerable high-school drop-out with a history of drug abuse. She also possesses unique supernatural abilities, which is why she was offered a place at the university. Alex becomes one of the guardians of Lethe House, a secret society monitoring the dark goings-on in the eight other Houses, which are run by a privileged elite inclined to occult excess. When a student is murdered, she uncovers a web of terror and abuse. Ninth House is a timely exploration of the use and abuse of power and a gut-churning thriller that pulls no punches, with a strong female lead and a headlong plot. In the first book of the Salvation series, Peter F Hamilton introduced a large cast scattered across a sprawling galaxy-wide utopia threatened by an enigmatic alien race. In Salvation Lost (Macmillan, \u00a320), he ratchets up the tension and splits the narrative between the 23rd century and the far future. We follow many characters from volume one, as well as a host of new faces, as the human race joins forces with benevolent extraterrestrials, the Ne\u00e1na, and works to save itself from the malign Olyix, who are intent on harvesting Homo sapiens as offerings to their god. Hamilton excels at interweaving the narratives of multiple viewpoint characters without once relaxing narrative impetus, combining time-lines to great dramatic effect and telling a tense hi-tech story that never loses sight of the human element. Best read after the opening volume, Salvation Lost is action-oriented hardcore science fiction at its page-turning best. Loosely based on the killings of a mother and daughter accused of witchcraft, Clay McLeod Chapman\u2019s The Remaking (Quirk, \u00a39.99) retells and recasts the real events in a series of connected episodes. When Ella Louise Ford and her daughter Jessica were burned as witches in Pilot\u2019s Creek, Virginia, in 1931, the murders and the stories of the subsequent ghostly hauntings echoed down the years. In 1971 the story is made into a low-budget horror film starring nine-year-old Amber Pendleton in the part of Jessica, a role that will haunt her for the rest of her life. In 1995 the original film is remade, with a washed-up, drug-addicted Amber this time playing the part of Jessica\u2019s mother. The story jumps to 2016, when the director of a podcast travels to Pilot\u2019s Creek to track down Amber and investigate the events of 1931. Chapman uses an array of narrative techniques in an ambitious mosaic novel exploring the power of urban myth and superstition. \u2022 Eric Brown\u2019s latest novel is Murder Served Cold (Severn House).",

      "bodyText": "Subscribe now to receive the morning briefing by email. Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. Texts suggest Trump exerting pressure on Ukraine president US diplomats told Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, that his hopes of meeting Donald Trump to improve Kyiv\u2019s relations with Washington rested on his vowing to investigate allegations against the Bidens. The exchange emerged in texts released as part of the impeachment inquiry, hours after Trump himself made an extraordinary public demand for China to investigate his prospective Democratic rival, threatening: \u201cIf they don\u2019t do what we want, we have tremendous, tremendous power.\u201d Kurt Volker. The first witness in the impeachment inquiry was the former special envoy on Ukraine, who believed he could maintain the US policy of upholding Ukrainian independence despite Trump\u2019s attachment to Putin. He was wrong, as Julian Borger reports. \u2018Deep state\u2019. The president\u2019s allies continue to blame the so-called \u201cdeep state\u201d for his impeachment, despite Steve Bannon himself debunking the conspiracy theory. In fact, says Richard Wolffe, Trump is becoming his own worst enemy. Russia helping China build missile defence system, says Putin The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has said his country is helping China to develop a ballistic missile defence system of a sort that has so far been used only by Russia and the US. The network of ground-based radars and space satellites would give Beijing early warning of intercontinental ballistic missile launches. Speaking at a conference in Moscow on Thursday, Putin said it was \u201ca very serious thing that will radically enhance China\u2019s defence capability\u201d. Eurasian cooperation. The news demonstrates increased cooperation between Moscow and Beijing at a time when US relations with both powers are complicated by controversy over the Kremlin\u2019s ties to Trump and the trade war between the US and China. US to demand Facebook \u2018backdoor\u2019 to encrypted messages The US, UK and Australia plan to pressure Facebook into providing governments with a \u201cbackdoor\u201d to its encrypted messaging system, allowing them to access the content of private communications, according to a letter from top officials to Mark Zuckerberg, which has been obtained by the Guardian. The signatories to the open letter, dated 4 October, include the US attorney general, William Barr, and Britain\u2019s home secretary, Priti Patel. Data access. The US and UK have also unveiled a \u201cworld-first\u201d data access agreement, permitting law enforcement agencies investigating serious crimes to demand certain data directly from the other country\u2019s tech firms without going through their governments. Los Angeles homeless face alarming increase in violence As a housing crisis forces more and more people on to the streets, homeless people and their advocates in Los Angeles are reportedly facing a rise in harassment and violence. Statistics have long shown that homeless people are more vulnerable to crimes such as assault, harassment and vandalism than the housed. The Guardian\u2019s Carla Green spoke to almost a dozen homeless Angelenos, who all said there had been a noticeable increase in attacks in the past year, by people who target them for being homeless. Arson attack. Prosecutors are reportedly considering charges of attempted murder against two men, including the son of a local chamber of commerce president, for setting fire to a homeless encampment in LA\u2019s Eagle Rock neighbourhood in August. Public banks. In a bid to tackle the affordable housing crisis, California has legalised the creation of public banks by cities and counties, which could provide public agencies access to loans at interest rates much lower than private banks. Cheat sheet The EU has urged the UK government to publish its new Brexit plan in full as Boris Johnson heads to Europe for talks with Angela Merkel and other leaders, while Ireland\u2019s prime minister has accused Johnson of misleading the British parliament. The actor James Franco faces a new lawsuit claiming he and other staff at his acting school \u201cengaged in widespread inappropriate and sexually charged behavior towards female students\u201d, accusations that Franco refutes as \u201cnot accurate\u201d. Google reportedly told subcontracted workers to target people with \u201cdarker skin tones\u201d when harvesting face scans from the public to improve the firm\u2019s facial recognition algorithms, which are notoriously inept at identifying people of color. Thousands of pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong have taken to the streets in masks after the territory\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam, prepares to implement harsh colonial-era emergency powers banning face masks. Must-reads Art-rock legend Kim Gordon: \u2018Consumerism is killing us\u2019 Sonic Youth, the seminal art-rock band Kim Gordon co-founded with her ex-husband Thurston Moore, came to a natural conclusion when the couple split in 2011. Now, at 66, she is releasing her first solo record. \u201cPlaying bass was never my desire,\u201d she tells Jenn Pelly. \u201cIt was a byproduct of wanting to make something exciting.\u201d Why is \u2018junk science\u2019 still sending people to death row? For decades, US law enforcement has used \u2018forensic hypnosis\u2019 to draw out testimony from witnesses and victims, despite growing evidence that it is unreliable, relying on a false notion of memory as \u201ca vast, permanent and potentially accessible storehouse of information,\u201d as Ariel Ramchandani reports. The week\u2019s best film about an extremist loner is not Joker The superficial similarities between the much-hyped revisionist supervillain movie Joker and Rob Lambert\u2019s grimy low-budget drama Cuck are striking. But it is Lambert\u2019s portrait of an online racist who turns to IRL violence that is the more repellent, honest and astute, says Charles Bramesco. Israel\u2019s Arab wineries illustrate the Palestinian struggle There are just two commercial Palestinian-owned wineries inside Israel, with clients including Yotam Ottolenghi and those Tel Aviv restaurants that want to avoid wine made on controversial Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. Miriam Berger meets the vintners keeping an Arab-Palestinian tradition alive. Opinion From teachers and hotel workers to nurses and auto workers, US labour groups have staged a wave of industrial action in 2019. But Democrats have yet to put forth policies that show they stand with the workers in this punishing economic climate, says Malaika Jabali. Despite this growing progressive fervor, the Democrats\u2019 congressional leadership \u2013 including Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer \u2013 have focused almost entirely on targeting Donald Trump. Sport Gardner Minshew II, the Jacksonville Jaguars\u2019 mustachioed rookie quarterback, has turned out to be far more than just an Uncle Rico lookalike, writes Hunter Felt. The first four games of his NFL career constitute one of the most impressive quarterback stretches in Jaguars history. Leicester City travel to Anfield on Saturday, hoping to derail Liverpool\u2019s perfect league start, while on Sunday Manchester United and Newcastle will both want to hit their stride after a slow spell when they face each other at St James\u2019 Park. Those are two of 10 things to look out for in the Premier League this weekend. Sign up The US morning briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.

      "body": "<p>\u201cSpeech, Rebecca!\u201d</p> <p>She jumps at the sound of her name.</p> <p>She was thinking about the house again. Even here, with all the noise and the people, it plays on her mind. She\u2019s itchy about not seeing it tonight.</p> <p>Shaking her head, Rebecca mouths \u201cno\u201d at Dan, laughing silently so he won\u2019t think she\u2019s being a killjoy.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll make a speech,\u201d Max booms from somewhere in the crowd, and she looks for him. Her husband isn\u2019t tall but always stands out; always somewhere in the centre of everything.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll make this quick,\u201d he appears beside her, grinning broadly as the room settles and turns to him expectantly. \u201cWe just want to thank everyone for coming, and for the generous gifts.\u201d Max waves vaguely at the table in the corner, brightly wrapped presents piled up. A single envelope has fallen on the floor and Rebecca stares at it as Max continues, thinking how easily things can get lost.</p> <p>\u201cAnd so,\u201d he takes her hand and she refocuses. \u201cIt\u2019s not just our anniversary. We\u2019re also celebrating Rebecca\u2019s promotion at work. We\u2019re all very proud of you, darling.\u201d He raises his glass. \u201cTo Rebecca!\u201d</p> <p>She smiles again as the room clinks and cheers.</p> <p>Max kisses her cheek quickly as he\u2019s sucked back into the party. She stays standing completely still for a moment, alone in the crowd, and her thoughts return to the house.</p> <p>It was about three months ago when she first saw it. She\u2019d decided to start cycling to and from work in a pique of fitness optimism, and stopped for breath on the edge of town, red-faced and panting hard.</p> <p>And there it was.</p> <p>Set back from the road and partially hidden behind tall, thick trees, the Georgian manor was big and cold and dark. Walls covered in ivy, the windows huge and blank, it reminded Rebecca of something out of gothic fiction. She stopped on her way home that night to stare again. And then every day after that. For a long time, Rebecca wasn\u2019t sure if anyone lived there \u2013 it was always dark; the curtains always shut. It was only recently she\u2019d noticed a light upstairs and occasional movement; a kind of rustling to the whole property. She wondered about it; about who lived there and what kind of life they led. It was hard to put her finger on what it was about the place that pulled her in. It just seemed \u2026 lonely. And the more she looked and thought about it, the less real the house became.</p> <p>At home that night, Rebecca doesn\u2019t sleep well. She creeps out of bed early, and her heart beats faster as she pedals towards the house, the now-familiar fizz of anticipation travelling up her throat. But something is different as she approaches \u2013 the gates are open. They\u2019ve never been open before, this is new. She slows right down, and it\u2019s then she sees an elderly woman on her knees in front of the house, clearly in distress.</p> <p>Unthinking, Rebecca quickly throws her bike to the ground, running.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she shouts frantically. \u201cAre you \u2026 do you need \u2026\u201d</p> <p>The woman shrieks.</p> <p>Rebecca stops short, a few feet away, the scene coming properly into focus.</p> <p>The woman was gardening. She was on her knees pulling up weeds \u2013 not in distress \u2013 and a wild-faced stranger just came running towards her, screaming.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"98d0a535bcd80d0b88357b596fe851f98d17eea9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98d0a535bcd80d0b88357b596fe851f98d17eea9/0_0_1500_1713/876.png\" alt=\"MS immersive dropin 1\" width=\"876\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Rebecca says, her face filling with blood. \u201cI thought you were on the ground. I thought you\u2019d had a fall.\u201d</p> <p>The woman picks herself up easily \u2013 she is around her mid-60s, not elderly after all \u2013 brushing herself down. She looks up, regarding Rebecca critically.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not about to kill me?\u201d she says.</p> <p>Rebecca laughs, but the mortification is still overwhelming. \u201cNo, I promise. I really am sorry, I\u2019ll go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWould you like a cup of tea?\u201d the woman says mildly. \u201cFor the shock? I was about to make one for myself anyway.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTea?\u201d Rebecca is surprised. \u201cWell, I\u2019m \u2026 I have to \u2026 \u201d She stops and nods decisively. \u201cThat would be lovely actually, if you\u2019re sure I\u2019m not interrupting?\u201d She offers a hand to shake and they both laugh as the woman holds up her oversized gardening gloves in response.</p> <p>\u201cCome in,\u201d she gestures for her to follow and Rebecca holds her breath as they walk in and through the hallway.</p> <p>And then she exhales. Because it\u2019s not anything like she imagined. It\u2019s bright, modern and airy. She\u2019d always pictured something dilapidated; peeling dark wallpaper steeped in some bleak history. Instead, everything is open-plan, expensive.</p> <p>They sit and the woman busies herself making tea. She doesn\u2019t ask how she takes it, heaping in sugar Rebecca never usually has and chatting happily about her grownup children.</p> <p>Children. It really doesn\u2019t marry with anything she\u2019d thought.</p> <p>The woman sits at last, smiling with her whole face.</p> <p>\u201cDo you see your children often?\u201d Rebecca asks, and the woman laughs.</p> <p>\u201cToo much!\u201d she waves her tea around. \u201cThey always need something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut the house, it always looks so \u2026\u201d Rebecca doesn\u2019t say isolated. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure anyone lived here, the curtains are always closed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy dear, I\u2019m retired,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you pass at this time of day, I\u2019m usually still in bed. And I close the curtains at six in the evenings, so I can snuggle up with the dogs and watch my soaps.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d This makes sense. Rebecca\u2019s at her desk by eight and never finishes work before seven these days. She suddenly feels a little like crying.</p> <p>They are silent for a moment and the woman reaches across the table for Rebecca\u2019s hand.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"132033487140e23a69a1cdc3a8f3f64c9d9056b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/132033487140e23a69a1cdc3a8f3f64c9d9056b4/0_0_1500_1713/876.png\" alt=\"MS immersive dropin 2\" width=\"876\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou\u2019re lonely,\u201d she says, and it\u2019s not a question. There is a long moment before Rebecca nods \u2013 and then sighs furiously, frustrated. \u201cBut I have no right to be! I have so much. Work, parties, a husband who loves me. It\u2019s everything I thought I was meant to have \u2013 what you\u2019re supposed to have, isn\u2019t it?\u201d She swallows hard. \u201cI looked around last night and realised I have no friends. We were surrounded by people, but they\u2019re all Max\u2019s friends. Mine have fallen away over the years. They get married, have families, move away. I feel so very left behind, like I\u2019m always on the outside, looking in.\u201d</p> <p>The woman nods. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to be surrounded by people and feel alone,\u201d she says quietly. \u201cAnd it\u2019s tiring trying to be happy and grateful all the time.\u201d She pauses. \u201cYou feel shame about your loneliness, but you shouldn\u2019t. We\u2019re all human beings, all trying our best, striving to connect with one another. We can\u2019t always succeed at it and, my dear, you are allowed to feel lonely. Don\u2019t wrestle with it, accept it. You can\u2019t find a light in the darkness while you\u2019re still refusing to acknowledge how you\u2019re feeling.\u201d</p> <p>She gives Rebecca\u2019s hand a squeeze. \u201cAnd if you need a friend, you have one here.\u201d</p> <p>Rebecca smiles at her; a real smile for the first time in a while.</p> <p>And they drink their sweet tea.</p> <p><em><strong>Sleep dreams<br></strong>The M&amp;S Sleep Shop has everything you need for a great night\u2019s sleep \u2013 including a real-life version of the duvet in the picture at the top of this page.

I was about to make one for myself anyway.\u201d \u201cTea?\u201d Rebecca is surprised. \u201cWell, I\u2019m \u2026 I have to \u2026 \u201d She stops and nods decisively. \u201cThat would be lovely actually, if you\u2019re sure I\u2019m not interrupting?\u201d She offers a hand to shake and they both laugh as the woman holds up her oversized gardening gloves in response. \u201cCome in,\u201d she gestures for her to follow and Rebecca holds her breath as they walk in and through the hallway. And then she exhales. Because it\u2019s not anything like she imagined. It\u2019s bright, modern and airy. She\u2019d always pictured something dilapidated; peeling dark wallpaper steeped in some bleak history. Instead, everything is open-plan, expensive. They sit and the woman busies herself making tea. She doesn\u2019t ask how she takes it, heaping in sugar Rebecca never usually has and chatting happily about her grownup children. Children. It really doesn\u2019t marry with anything she\u2019d thought. The woman sits at last, smiling with her whole face. \u201cDo you see your children often?\u201d Rebecca asks, and the woman laughs. \u201cToo much!\u201d she waves her tea around. \u201cThey always need something.\u201d \u201cBut the house, it always looks so \u2026\u201d Rebecca doesn\u2019t say isolated. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure anyone lived here, the curtains are always closed.\u201d \u201cMy dear, I\u2019m retired,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you pass at this time of day, I\u2019m usually still in bed. And I close the curtains at six in the evenings, so I can snuggle up with the dogs and watch my soaps.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d This makes sense. Rebecca\u2019s at her desk by eight and never finishes work before seven these days. She suddenly feels a little like crying. They are silent for a moment and the woman reaches across the table for Rebecca\u2019s hand. \u201cYou\u2019re lonely,\u201d she says, and it\u2019s not a question. There is a long moment before Rebecca nods \u2013 and then sighs furiously, frustrated. \u201cBut I have no right to be! I have so much. Work, parties, a husband who loves me. It\u2019s everything I thought I was meant to have \u2013 what you\u2019re supposed to have, isn\u2019t it?\u201d She swallows hard. \u201cI looked around last night and realised I have no friends. We were surrounded by people, but they\u2019re all Max\u2019s friends. Mine have fallen away over the years. They get married, have families, move away. I feel so very left behind, like I\u2019m always on the outside, looking in.\u201d The woman nods. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to be surrounded by people and feel alone,\u201d she says quietly. \u201cAnd it\u2019s tiring trying to be happy and grateful all the time.\u201d She pauses. \u201cYou feel shame about your loneliness, but you shouldn\u2019t. We\u2019re all human beings, all trying our best, striving to connect with one another. We can\u2019t always succeed at it and, my dear, you are allowed to feel lonely. Don\u2019t wrestle with it, accept it. You can\u2019t find a light in the darkness while you\u2019re still refusing to acknowledge how you\u2019re feeling.\u201d She gives Rebecca\u2019s hand a squeeze. \u201cAnd if you need a friend, you have one here.\u201d Rebecca smiles at her; a real smile for the first time in a while. And they drink their sweet tea.

      "body": "<p>First produced in Boston in 2018, Eleanor Burgess\u2019s play sets up a fierce debate that covers race, revolution, American history and academic process. It\u2019s refreshing to see a genuine play of ideas, and Burgess shows the strengths and flaws of her two antagonists; her even-handedness only deserts her in the play\u2019s unduly protracted second half.</p> <p>The setting is an elite university in the last year of the Obama presidency and there are just two characters. Janine is a white, sixtysomething history professor who keeps a portrait of George Washington on her wall; Zoe is a 20-year-old black student and an eager participant in campus protest. Battle is joined over a paper Zoe has written claiming that America never had a truly radical revolution because the people really suffering were slaves who had no voice. Janine admits it\u2019s an interesting thesis but demands documentary proof. Zoe counters that the exploited rarely leave evidence behind. This broadens out into a ferocious argument about the partial vision of history taught in the US, with Zoe accusing Janine of racism.</p> <p>It is stirring stuff in which you see both points of view: Janine, the daughter of Polish immigrants, has faith in American democracy while Zoe is impatient for revolutionary change. But after the interval, the dramatic interest wanes as the two exhausted combatants meet again to reveal their lack of common ground Burgess also introduces side issues such as Janine\u2019s sexual and Zoe\u2019s mental history. Even if Matthew Iliffe\u2019s production looks a tad under-rehearsed, the piece is sustained by its performers. Janie Dee brings out Janine\u2019s impeccable liberal credentials and scholarly orthodoxy while showing a woman shocked into an awareness that a new generation demands more than incremental progress. Moronke Akinola, in her professional debut, captures Zoe\u2019s uncompromising rigour and activist spirit while hinting that her anger conceals a lack of empathy.</p> <p>It\u2019s a good play but I was disappointed that Burgess finally abandoned her dialectical fairness and allowed herself to take sides. </p> <ul> <li><p>At the <a href=\"https://www.finboroughtheatre.co.uk/productions/2019/the-niceties.php\">Finborough theatre</a>, London, until 26 October.</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "First produced in Boston in 2018, Eleanor Burgess\u2019s play sets up a fierce debate that covers race, revolution, American history and academic process. It\u2019s refreshing to see a genuine play of ideas, and Burgess shows the strengths and flaws of her two antagonists; her even-handedness only deserts her in the play\u2019s unduly protracted second half. The setting is an elite university in the last year of the Obama presidency and there are just two characters. Janine is a white, sixtysomething history professor who keeps a portrait of George Washington on her wall; Zoe is a 20-year-old black student and an eager participant in campus protest. Battle is joined over a paper Zoe has written claiming that America never had a truly radical revolution because the people really suffering were slaves who had no voice. Janine admits it\u2019s an interesting thesis but demands documentary proof. Zoe counters that the exploited rarely leave evidence behind. This broadens out into a ferocious argument about the partial vision of history taught in the US, with Zoe accusing Janine of racism. It is stirring stuff in which you see both points of view: Janine, the daughter of Polish immigrants, has faith in American democracy while Zoe is impatient for revolutionary change. But after the interval, the dramatic interest wanes as the two exhausted combatants meet again to reveal their lack of common ground Burgess also introduces side issues such as Janine\u2019s sexual and Zoe\u2019s mental history. Even if Matthew Iliffe\u2019s production looks a tad under-rehearsed, the piece is sustained by its performers. Janie Dee brings out Janine\u2019s impeccable liberal credentials and scholarly orthodoxy while showing a woman shocked into an awareness that a new generation demands more than incremental progress. Moronke Akinola, in her professional debut, captures Zoe\u2019s uncompromising rigour and activist spirit while hinting that her anger conceals a lack of empathy. It\u2019s a good play but I was disappointed that Burgess finally abandoned her dialectical fairness and allowed herself to take sides. At the Finborough theatre, London, until 26 October.",

Zuboff stands on a low stage, making eye-contact with her audience. She spies someone who seems unconvinced, invites them to raise their concerns. \u201cWhen this book was published in January, I left home for three weeks on the road,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m still going.\u201d</p> <p>The audience laughs. Because<em> The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</em> \u2013 a 700-plus page sociological analysis of the digital era \u2013 has become an epoch-defining international bestseller, drawing comparisons to revolutionary works such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/sep/30/silent-spring-rachel-carson-review\" title=\"\">Rachel Carson\u2019s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/sep/30/silent-spring-rachel-carson-review\" title=\"\">Silent Spring</a></em>. Naomi Klein has urged everyone to read it \u201cas an act of digital self-defence\u201d.</p> <p>It describes how global tech companies such as Google and Facebook persuaded us to give up our privacy for the sake of convenience; how personal information (\u201cdata\u201d) gathered by these companies has been used by others not only to predict our behaviour but also to influence and modify it; and how this has had disastrous consequences for democracy and freedom. This is the \u201csurveillance capitalism\u201d of the title, which Zuboff defines as a \u201cnew economic order\u201d and \u201can expropriation of critical human rights that is best understood as a coup from above\u201d.</p> <p>Later, in an unglamorous spot by some parked vans, Zuboff explains why she wrote her book. She has dark eyes behind horn-rimmed glasses; abundant black curls; a low, resonant voice. She is brilliantly erudite and outlines her argument in trenchant, honed phrases, as if reading aloud. Her work on the themes of <em>The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</em> began as far back as the late 1970s. She was a postgraduate at Harvard, writing a doctorate on the Industrial Revolution. To earn money, she became an organisational change consultant, working in offices that were \u201ccomputerising\u201d for the first time. \u201cThey were expecting immediate productivity, growth, efficiency. But it was chaos, disaster. Crazy stuff was happening. People were saying \u2018My work is floating in space!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In 1978, Zuboff was working at the Washington Post, with linotypists who were converting to cold type. \u201cOne day I had just finished the graveyard shift, and I wandered into the National Gallery of Art, where I saw these hulking, dirty, dark entities in the pit of a bright white amphitheatre.\u201d It was the Voltri-Bolton series by David Smith \u2013 an American sculptor who in the 1960s created sculptures from old factory machinery and debris. \u201cI realised then the process of computerisation would be the next industrial revolution, and it would change everything \u2013 including how we think, and feel and how we create meaning.

She later became one of the youngest professors to receive an endowed chair. With her husband, Zuboff went to live in rural Maine; they raised their children, farmed deer. In 2009, their home was struck by lightning and burned to the ground.

Surveillance capitalists \u201csell certainty to business customers who would like to know with certainty what we do. Targeted adverts, yes, but also businesses want to know whether to sell us a mortgage, insurance, what to charge us, do we drive safely? They want to know the maximum they can extract from us in an exchange. They want to know how we will behave in order to know how to best intervene in our behaviour.\u201d The best way to make your predictions desirable to customers is to ensure they come true: \u201cto tune and herd and shape and push us in the direction that creates the highest probability of their business success\u201d. There\u2019s no way \u201cto dress this up as anything but behavioural modification\u201d. In 2012 and 2013, Facebook conducted \u201cmassive-scale contagion experiments\u201d to see if they could \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/02/facebook-apologises-psychological-experiments-on-users\" title=\"\">affect real-world emotions and behaviour, in ways that bypassed user awareness</a>\u201d. </p> <p>There are crux points in the lives of societies and individuals. A revelation in a gallery. A cataclysmic fire, and a salvaged notebook. Zuboff argues that we are now at one more crux point: \u201cThe age of surveillance capitalism is a titanic struggle between capital and each one of us. It is a direct intervention into free will, an assault on human autonomy.\u201d It is the capture of our intimate personal details, even of our faces. \u201cThey have no right to my face, to take it when I walk down the street.\u201d</p> <p>Such violations threaten our freedom, Zuboff says. \u201cWhen we think about free will, philosophers talk about closing the gap between present and future. We make ourselves a promise: I\u2019ll do something with that future moment \u2013 go to a meeting, make a phone call. If we are treated as a mass of \u2018users\u2019, to be herded and coaxed, then this promise becomes meaningless. I am a distinctive human. I have an indelible crucible of power within me\u2026 I should decide if my face becomes data, my home, my car, my voice becomes data. It should be my choice.\u201d</p> <p>Born in New England in 1951, Zuboff is the daughter of a pharmacist and a homemaker. Her maternal grandfather, Max Miller, was a self-made entrepreneur, who invented the servomechanism for the vending machine. In her youth, she \u201cdid lots of growing up in Argentina, living on the Altiplano, with people who lived very simple lives\u201d. She is passionate about the natural world; her analogies often invoke farming and the rural environment. The only time she pauses mid-sentence is when a magpie with iridescent blue feathers alights beside us. \u201cWhat a beautiful bird!\u201d Zuboff tells me that at the start of the Industrial Revolution persuading farmers to work in factories was like trying to get a deer to pull a plough. It was too incongruous, they wouldn\u2019t do it. \u201cThen after a while, the deer took the plough. There\u2019s a brief window before social amnesia sets in.\u201d</p> <p>When I ask how deliberate this all was, if <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/22/mark-zuckerberg-tape-webcam-microphone-facebook\" title=\"\">Mark Zuckerberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/jul/23/entrepreneur-larry-page-google-innovation-change\" title=\"\">Larry Page</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/apr/15/web-freedom-threat-google-brin\" title=\"\">Sergey Brin</a> were just a bunch of happy tech-utopians who accidentally opened Pandora\u2019s box, she smiles wryly. \u201cThis was world-historical wealth creation.\u201d Surveillance capitalists have \u201cmany strategies to protect themselves from the law. Lobbying, political capture, other economic methods that we associate with cartelisation.\u201d They have also claimed that the internet is a new reality with different protocols; \u201cLarry Page has said how could Google follow any law that came into being before the internet? This is propaganda.\u201d In her talk at the festival, Zuboff dismisses another proposition, that these are innovative companies that occasionally make mistakes. \u201cYes, like Google Nest [Google\u2019s home security system]: \u2018Oh we\u2019re so sorry, we put a microphone in the Nest surveillance system and we forgot! We forgot to put it in the schematic.\u201d (This story broke in February, and Google described its failure to put the microphone on tech specs as \u201can error\u201d.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I felt I was up against the clock\u00a0of social amnesia, psychic numbing \u2013 people\u00a0were losing their sense\u00a0of astonishment</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What about Zuckerberg\u2019s claims that \u201cprivacy is no longer a social norm\u201d, or the advice of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/dec/21/eric-schmidt-resigns-executive-chairman-alphabet-google\" title=\"\">Eric Schmidt</a> (Google CEO, 2001-2011): \u201cIf you have something that you don\u2019t want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn\u2019t be doing it in the first place?\u201d Zuboff has, of course, heard this line a thousand times. It has been repeated not only by surveillance capitalists, but also by governments advocating the mass surveillance of civilians. She is brisk in response: \u201cI tell people, if you have nothing to hide then you are nothing. This isn\u2019t about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/15/neoliberalism-ideology-problem-george-monbiot\" title=\"\">Hayekian individuality</a>, libertarianism \u2013 it\u2019s a historical process of individuation that has developed hand in hand with political freedom and democracy.\u201d It\u2019s also not Orwell, not Big Brother. \u201cThere\u2019s no one coming to take anyone away to the Gulag. It doesn\u2019t want to kill us. It just wants to move us in the direction of its predictions and get the data.\u201d Although, \u201cin China we see the attempt to annex these technologies to the repressive state\u201d.</p> <p>Some have also proposed that \u201cchoice architecture\u201d \u2013 nudges and coaxes \u2013 can be societally beneficial, if used wisely. Proponents of this argument include Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler (co-authors of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jul/20/politics.society1\" title=\"\">Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness</a></em>). Zuboff disagrees vigorously. \u201cOnce you legitimate the ex-machina nudge it is intolerable. It is an act of power over the other \u2013 rather than educating or alerting. Nudging is paternalistic. Behavioural economists such as Thaler legitimated the nudge, empowered and increased the audacity of the surveillance capitalists. Thaler got the Nobel prize.\u201d</p> <p>Why does she care so much? \u201cI gave up a lot of time to write this book, over many years,\u201d she says. \u201cI gave up time with my husband, my children. I gave up my health. Everything I had I gave, because I felt I was up against the clock of social amnesia, psychic numbing \u2013 people were losing their sense of astonishment.\u201d Yes, she agrees that \u201cSnowden made a huge contribution to waking people up. The tech companies were implicated.\u201d Leaked documents showed the NSA collecting data from Yahoo, Google, Facebook and Microsoft. And the Cambridge Analytica scandal? \u201cCarole Cadwalladr\u2019s work is heroic. And Chris Wylie [the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower] revealed that every aspect of Cambridge Analytica\u2019s operations was simply mimicking a day in the life of a surveillance capitalist.\u201d Instead of behavioural modification for commercial ends, the ends become political? Voting instead of buying? \u201cDemocracy is on the ropes in the UK, US, many other countries. Not in small measure because of the operations of surveillance capitalism.\u201d</p> <p>Every time Zuboff speaks in public, she asks the audience: \u201cWhat are the concerns that bring you here?\u201d People call out words: privacy; dystopia; control; monopoly; manipulation; intrusion; exploitation; democracy; misinformation; fear; freedom; power; rebellion; slavery; resistance. Everywhere the words are virtually the same. What can be done? People object, but nothing happens. Doesn\u2019t that lead to lassitude? \u201cRegulation,\u201d she says, firmly. \u201cThis is what the tech companies fear most. We say that markets that trade in human futures are illegal \u2013 like the slave trade was made illegal.\u201d Then we design \u201cprograms as a closed loop\u201d and \u201creclaim the idea that we can have the digital without surveillance capitalism\u201d. This will require the \u201cindignation\u201d of citizens, journalists, scholars and law-makers. \u201cSurveillance capitalism has had 20 years unimpeded by law. But it is very young.\u201d </p> <p>The following day Zuboff is to give another speech, asking another audience: \u201cWhat are the concerns that bring you here?\u201d like a reclaimed version of that old Facebook question: \u201cWhat\u2019s on your mind?\u201d</p> <p>Zuboff has now been on the road for nine months. The alternative, doing nothing and being \u201csubsumed in unadulterated power\u201d is not an option for her. \u201cWe are not simply users. We are much used.

This isn\u2019t about Hayekian individuality, libertarianism \u2013 it\u2019s a historical process of individuation that has developed hand in hand with political freedom and democracy.\u201d It\u2019s also not Orwell, not Big Brother. \u201cThere\u2019s no one coming to take anyone away to the Gulag. It doesn\u2019t want to kill us. It just wants to move us in the direction of its predictions and get the data.\u201d Although, \u201cin China we see the attempt to annex these technologies to the repressive state\u201d. Some have also proposed that \u201cchoice architecture\u201d \u2013 nudges and coaxes \u2013 can be societally beneficial, if used wisely. Proponents of this argument include Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler (co-authors of Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness). Zuboff disagrees vigorously. \u201cOnce you legitimate the ex-machina nudge it is intolerable. It is an act of power over the other \u2013 rather than educating or alerting. Nudging is paternalistic. Behavioural economists such as Thaler legitimated the nudge, empowered and increased the audacity of the surveillance capitalists. Thaler got the Nobel prize.\u201d Why does she care so much? \u201cI gave up a lot of time to write this book, over many years,\u201d she says. \u201cI gave up time with my husband, my children. I gave up my health. Everything I had I gave, because I felt I was up against the clock of social amnesia, psychic numbing \u2013 people were losing their sense of astonishment.\u201d Yes, she agrees that \u201cSnowden made a huge contribution to waking people up. The tech companies were implicated.\u201d Leaked documents showed the NSA collecting data from Yahoo, Google, Facebook and Microsoft. And the Cambridge Analytica scandal? \u201cCarole Cadwalladr\u2019s work is heroic. And Chris Wylie [the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower] revealed that every aspect of Cambridge Analytica\u2019s operations was simply mimicking a day in the life of a surveillance capitalist.\u201d Instead of behavioural modification for commercial ends, the ends become political? Voting instead of buying? \u201cDemocracy is on the ropes in the UK, US, many other countries. Not in small measure because of the operations of surveillance capitalism.\u201d Every time Zuboff speaks in public, she asks the audience: \u201cWhat are the concerns that bring you here?\u201d People call out words: privacy; dystopia; control; monopoly; manipulation; intrusion; exploitation; democracy; misinformation; fear; freedom; power; rebellion; slavery; resistance. Everywhere the words are virtually the same. What can be done? People object, but nothing happens. Doesn\u2019t that lead to lassitude? \u201cRegulation,\u201d she says, firmly. \u201cThis is what the tech companies fear most. We say that markets that trade in human futures are illegal \u2013 like the slave trade was made illegal.\u201d Then we design \u201cprograms as a closed loop\u201d and \u201creclaim the idea that we can have the digital without surveillance capitalism\u201d. This will require the \u201cindignation\u201d of citizens, journalists, scholars and law-makers. \u201cSurveillance capitalism has had 20 years unimpeded by law. But it is very young.\u201d The following day Zuboff is to give another speech, asking another audience: \u201cWhat are the concerns that bring you here?\u201d like a reclaimed version of that old Facebook question: \u201cWhat\u2019s on your mind?\u201d Zuboff has now been on the road for nine months. The alternative, doing nothing and being \u201csubsumed in unadulterated power\u201d is not an option for her. \u201cWe are not simply users. We are much used. We have to awaken to our shared future.\u201d \u2022 The Age of Surveillance Capitalism is published by Profile (\u00a310.99). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com or call 020-3176 3837.

      "body": "<p>In 2012, an activist-led project called the Rolling Jubilee grabbed international headlines by raising enough money online from small dollar donations to buy and eradicate almost $15m of medical debt.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/04/as-trumps-lies-reach-new-heights-have-the-media-reached-a-tipping-point\">As Trump's lies reach new heights, have the media reached a tipping point?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I was part of the group that spearheaded the effort. We sent letters to thousands of people across the country telling them their debts had been erased, no strings attached.</p> <p>Why did we do it? The answer is simple: healthcare is a human right and medical debt is a moral and political abomination. In the richest country in the world, it is obscene that millions of people are pushed into poverty and insolvency because they had the bad luck of getting sick and needing to see a doctor.</p> <p>Last week, the presidential candidate Bernie Sanders followed in the Rolling Jubilee\u2019s footsteps. His campaign made history <a href=\"https://berniesanders.com/en/issues/eliminating-medical-debt/\">by declaring that $81bn</a> of past-due medical debt belonging to more than 46 million people would be wiped out should he win the White House. Under a Sanders administration, \u201cthe federal government will negotiate and pay off past-due medical bills in collections that have been reported to credit agencies\u201d.</p> <p>Sanders also proposed that the IRS \u201creview the billing and collection practices of the nearly 3,000 non-profit hospitals to ensure they are in line with the charitable care standards for non-profit tax status, and take action against those who are not\u201d.</p> <p>\ufeffThrilled as we are to see a presidential candidate proposing to scale up the basic premise of our scrappy activist project to the national level, we believe that buying medical debt is not necessarily the best approach. Why should debt holders\u2019 property rights be respected when the debts in question are immoral to begin with?</p> <p>One reason debt collectors are notorious for desperate, high pressure and deceptive tactics is because the vast majority of medical debt in collections is already out of statute. There is no legal force these collectors can appeal to in order to compel payment on out-of-statute debt, which is why many hospitals and collectors end up writing this debt off. What\u2019s more, <a href=\"http://www.dc37.net/wp-content/uploads/benefits/health/pdf/MELS_proof.pdf\">as many as 94% of debts</a> cannot be substantiated in court because creditors lack the necessary paperwork. (This is why the <a href=\"https://debtcollective.org/\">Debt Collective has created a debt dispute tool</a> that anyone can use, free of charge, to challenge any debt currently in collection, including medical bills. If you take the time to dispute your debts, there\u2019s a good chance the collector will back off and you won\u2019t have to pay.)</p> <p>Sanders knows this. That\u2019s why, under his plan, the government would \u201c[p]rohibit the collection of debt beyond the statute of limitations\u201d. But that raises a question: why not take that logic further - and effectively prohibit the collection of <em>all</em> medical debt?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/27/us-hospitals-lawsuits-medical-bills\">The US hospitals suing the poor over bills they can't afford</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The secondary market for medical debt only exists because the state enforces the legitimacy of the debts in courts of law. The government should start to treat medical debt the way it treats debts to the mafia, which is to say that such debts have no legal legitimacy. If the state stopped defending the property rights of predators, the problem of medical debt would disappear.</p> <p>We need a method of debt cancellation that refuses to compromise with vultures who profit from suffering. That said, if government officials insist on purchasing medical debts in order to erase them, they should do it in a way that paves the way for more wide-scale debt relief for those who desperately need it.</p> <p>Consider an idea from the British journalist Grace Blakely. In her book Stolen: How to Save the World From Financialization, she proposes a new public banking system that could buy various kinds of debts, imposing a haircut on private banks and creditors, in order to refinance them at dramatically reduced interest rates or even write them off entirely. Variations of this idea could be used to address not only the problem of unpayable healthcare costs but the broader crisis of American consumer debt, ranging from mortgages to credit cards to payday loans.</p> <p>Just last year, the Debt Collective executive director, Laura Hanna, a veteran of the Rolling Jubilee, advised the New York state assemblyman Ron Kim on a plan to redefine debt as property under eminent domain law. This brilliant conceptual leap would allow public officials working at the state level to reimagine ways to protect their constituents from bad financial actors.</p> <p>Last year, 8 million people were pushed into poverty because of medical expenses. The personal stories told at a recent Sanders-hosted town hall were gut-wrenching: a beloved wife who died of colon cancer, avoiding treatment because of the expense; a $40,000 bill for an ectopic pregnancy that didn\u2019t even require an overnight stay; families rationing life-saving medicine such as insulin between ill parents and young children.</p> <p>Any truly permanent solution to our medical debt crisis must tackle the problem at the root. No one should have to choose between life-saving medical care or food and shelter, and in countries with free and universal healthcare, medical debt doesn\u2019t exist.</p> <p>In the meantime, we can back candidates who accurately diagnose the problem of medical debt and are willing to fight for indebted Americans who need help.

      "bodyText": "In 2012, an activist-led project called the Rolling Jubilee grabbed international headlines by raising enough money online from small dollar donations to buy and eradicate almost $15m of medical debt. I was part of the group that spearheaded the effort. We sent letters to thousands of people across the country telling them their debts had been erased, no strings attached. Why did we do it? The answer is simple: healthcare is a human right and medical debt is a moral and political abomination. In the richest country in the world, it is obscene that millions of people are pushed into poverty and insolvency because they had the bad luck of getting sick and needing to see a doctor. Last week, the presidential candidate Bernie Sanders followed in the Rolling Jubilee\u2019s footsteps. His campaign made history by declaring that $81bn of past-due medical debt belonging to more than 46 million people would be wiped out should he win the White House. Under a Sanders administration, \u201cthe federal government will negotiate and pay off past-due medical bills in collections that have been reported to credit agencies\u201d. Sanders also proposed that the IRS \u201creview the billing and collection practices of the nearly 3,000 non-profit hospitals to ensure they are in line with the charitable care standards for non-profit tax status, and take action against those who are not\u201d. \ufeffThrilled as we are to see a presidential candidate proposing to scale up the basic premise of our scrappy activist project to the national level, we believe that buying medical debt is not necessarily the best approach. Why should debt holders\u2019 property rights be respected when the debts in question are immoral to begin with? One reason debt collectors are notorious for desperate, high pressure and deceptive tactics is because the vast majority of medical debt in collections is already out of statute. There is no legal force these collectors can appeal to in order to compel payment on out-of-statute debt, which is why many hospitals and collectors end up writing this debt off. What\u2019s more, as many as 94% of debts cannot be substantiated in court because creditors lack the necessary paperwork. (This is why the Debt Collective has created a debt dispute tool that anyone can use, free of charge, to challenge any debt currently in collection, including medical bills. If you take the time to dispute your debts, there\u2019s a good chance the collector will back off and you won\u2019t have to pay.) Sanders knows this. That\u2019s why, under his plan, the government would \u201c[p]rohibit the collection of debt beyond the statute of limitations\u201d. But that raises a question: why not take that logic further - and effectively prohibit the collection of all medical debt? The secondary market for medical debt only exists because the state enforces the legitimacy of the debts in courts of law. The government should start to treat medical debt the way it treats debts to the mafia, which is to say that such debts have no legal legitimacy. If the state stopped defending the property rights of predators, the problem of medical debt would disappear. We need a method of debt cancellation that refuses to compromise with vultures who profit from suffering. That said, if government officials insist on purchasing medical debts in order to erase them, they should do it in a way that paves the way for more wide-scale debt relief for those who desperately need it. Consider an idea from the British journalist Grace Blakely. In her book Stolen: How to Save the World From Financialization, she proposes a new public banking system that could buy various kinds of debts, imposing a haircut on private banks and creditors, in order to refinance them at dramatically reduced interest rates or even write them off entirely. Variations of this idea could be used to address not only the problem of unpayable healthcare costs but the broader crisis of American consumer debt, ranging from mortgages to credit cards to payday loans. Just last year, the Debt Collective executive director, Laura Hanna, a veteran of the Rolling Jubilee, advised the New York state assemblyman Ron Kim on a plan to redefine debt as property under eminent domain law. This brilliant conceptual leap would allow public officials working at the state level to reimagine ways to protect their constituents from bad financial actors. Last year, 8 million people were pushed into poverty because of medical expenses. The personal stories told at a recent Sanders-hosted town hall were gut-wrenching: a beloved wife who died of colon cancer, avoiding treatment because of the expense; a $40,000 bill for an ectopic pregnancy that didn\u2019t even require an overnight stay; families rationing life-saving medicine such as insulin between ill parents and young children. Any truly permanent solution to our medical debt crisis must tackle the problem at the root. No one should have to choose between life-saving medical care or food and shelter, and in countries with free and universal healthcare, medical debt doesn\u2019t exist. In the meantime, we can back candidates who accurately diagnose the problem of medical debt and are willing to fight for indebted Americans who need help. Sanders\u2019 plan gets us closest to a cure.

United have won only once since their opening 4-0 victory over Chelsea, with Marcus Rashford's penalty earning them a 1-0 home win against Leicester.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Fall from grace:</b>&nbsp;It is just two years since Jos\u00e9 Mourinho oversaw United's joint-best start to a Premier League season. United claimed 19 points from their first seven games in 2017-18, equalling the starts made by Sir Alex Ferguson's sides in 1999-2000 and 2011-12.

David Moyes also took 10 points from his first seven games in the 2013-14 season, while Louis van Gaal won 11 and 16 points in the respective 2014-15 and 2015-16 campaigns.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>30-year low:</b> The last time United made such a poor start to a campaign was under Ferguson in the days of the old First Division. United picked up only seven points from their first seven games of the 1989-90 season, a run that brought successive defeats to Derby, Norwich and Everton and ended with a famous 5-1 thrashing by Manchester City at Maine Road.

I do feel an away win is going to come. If it doesn\u2019t we\u2019ll be getting the same questions after every game.

I\u2019ve felt that maybe a couple of times but not very often. I\u2019m going to set up a team to try and win at Newcastle and I\u2019m sure Brucey [Steve Bruce] is going to do the same.

This is a tricky fixture for Solskj\u00e6r, for while on the one hand it appears to present an opportunity to pick up three points, should Manchester United fail it would be legitimate to wonder which Premier League opponents might be beatable away from home. Solkjaer has promised some fresh players, and doubtless intends to use more senior players in the starting lineup than he did against Alkmaar, though Anthony Martial remains injured and in all probability Paul Pogba\u2019s rest will be extended. \u201cPaul will probably not be ready,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said. \u201cThere\u2019s an international break coming up and it might be better to give him the 10 or 14 days extra to be ready for Liverpool. I do feel an away win is going to come. If it doesn\u2019t we\u2019ll be getting the same questions after every game. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve been playing too badly; sometimes the execution in front of goal has not quite been there, but that\u2019s something we\u2019ll work on. \u201cI haven\u2019t walked off at the end of many games thinking there was a big gap between us and our opponents. I\u2019ve felt that maybe a couple of times but not very often. I\u2019m going to set up a team to try and win at Newcastle and I\u2019m sure Brucey [Steve Bruce] is going to do the same. The surface against Alkmaar was a hard one to play on but we have a couple of days for recovery and should be ready for Sunday, no excuses whatsoever.\u201d",

It\u2019s not groundbreaking territory, but frontman Kiaran Crook is becoming a poetic lyricist, especially when addressing self-doubt, insecurity or home thoughts from abroad. In Dreams, he frets about those left behind on zero-hours contracts. NYC (Sing It Loud) takes \u201cthe last train out to somewhere, anywhere will do\u201d. Every so often, he comes out with a beauty such as Time to Go\u2019s \u201csunk to the bottom of the ocean, through the blue waves of your eyes\u201d. No musical wheels are reinvented, but intriguing curveballs range from Give It All Up\u2019s Take That harmonies to Magic Man\u2019s segue into a colliery band.

      "bodyText": "Mirroring Catfish and the Bottlemen\u2019s emergence from Llandudno, young indie foursome the Sherlocks blazed out of deprived Bolton upon Dearne in South Yorkshire in 2017 and landed in the Top 10. Titling their debut Live for the Moment seemed to confirm that their spirited but elementary indie rock didn\u2019t bode too well for longevity. However, their second album makes a surprising quantum leap. Producer James Skelly \u2013 the Coral\u2019s melodic alchemist \u2013 has helmed a much more mature, effervescent rock sound closer to the Killers or Manchester\u2019s James (who are tellingly name-checked). The songs form a travelogue of the Sherlocks\u2019 adventures, all getting lost in big cities, whirlwind romances and \u201csinging at the top of your voice when you\u2019re feeling down\u201d. It\u2019s not groundbreaking territory, but frontman Kiaran Crook is becoming a poetic lyricist, especially when addressing self-doubt, insecurity or home thoughts from abroad. In Dreams, he frets about those left behind on zero-hours contracts. NYC (Sing It Loud) takes \u201cthe last train out to somewhere, anywhere will do\u201d. Every so often, he comes out with a beauty such as Time to Go\u2019s \u201csunk to the bottom of the ocean, through the blue waves of your eyes\u201d. No musical wheels are reinvented, but intriguing curveballs range from Give It All Up\u2019s Take That harmonies to Magic Man\u2019s segue into a colliery band. Foremost, the 11 highly anthemic songs all have arena-sized choruses, which deserve to be widely heard and loudly sung.",

      "bodyText": "Enable remains odds-on at 4-5 for the Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp on Sunday after being drawn in stall nine for Europe\u2019s showpiece event. Charlie Appleby\u2019s Ghaiyyath, however, has drifted in the betting after being handed the widest draw in stall 12, a difficult starting position for a horse that seems best when he can get to the lead. Last year\u2019s Arc showed the potential importance of the draw at Longchamp, as Sea Of Class, from stall 15, narrowly failed to overhaul Enable, from five, after being forced to drop in at the rear of the field. The smallest Arc field since 2007 should mean it is less significant on Sunday, giving Enable every chance to make history as the first horse to win the race three times. Three of the four horses at the head of the ante-post betting were drawn towards the outside, with Japan and Ryan Moore immediately to Enable\u2019s left in 10. Sottsass, the French Derby winner, is the only leading contender with a low stall, against the rail in one. Magical, a stable companion of Japan at the Aidan O\u2019Brien yard, is alongside him in stall eight, while Waldgeist, who will be Andr\u00e9 Fabre\u2019s only runner as the trainer seeks a record eighth Arc victory, is drawn in three. Ghaiyyath, who took the Group One Grosser Preis von Baden by 14 lengths last time out, eased from 10-1 to 12-1 with several layers after the draw on Thursday, having made most or all of the running to win both in Germany and in the Prix d\u2019Harcourt at Longchamp in April. His only defeat this year came in the Prix Ganay, again at Longchamp, when he was unable to dominate and while William Buick, his big-race jockey, has suggested this week that his mount is \u201cnot one-dimensional\u201d, a soft lead on Sunday now looks highly unlikely. The going at Longchamp was described as soft on Thursday morning, with no more than 2mm of rain forecast for the track on Friday and Saturday. Earlier fears of more significant rain ahead of Sunday\u2019s big race have also receded, with no more than 4mm expected at the track on Sunday. Friday\u2019s best bets Six weeks after suffering injuries to his collarbone and neck in a fall at Chelmsford, Silvestre de Sousa will make a welcome return to the saddle at Ascot with the aim of reaching peak fitness in time for Champions Day at the same course a fortnight on Saturday. That meeting will also mark the end of his current (and third) reign as champion jockey, though few would bet against him landing the title for a fourth time at some point over the next few years.

And they have been clicked almost 700,000 times.</p> <p>The eddies of such online outrage sometimes spread into the real world. At a town hall meeting in January, an audience member accused Trudeau of supporting Sharia law \u2013 before intimating that he should be hanged for treason.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1d17b77c6a103497653400ebedada92607100ba8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d17b77c6a103497653400ebedada92607100ba8/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Recent polling suggests many Canadians are a politely jingoistic bunch who are inclined to believe that immigrants in general, and Muslims in particular, are too numerous above the 49th parallel.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Recent polling suggests many Canadians are a politely jingoistic bunch who are inclined to believe that immigrants in general, and Muslims in particular, are too numerous above the 49th parallel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Guardian Design/The  Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>More recently, the Conservative party candidate Cameron Ogilvie stepped down after the activist group Press Progress <a href=\"https://pressprogress.ca/proud-to-be-white-conservative-candidate-resigns-after-secret-anti-immigrant-facebook-account-discovered/\">unearthed</a> social media posts in which Ogilvie shared a post accusing Trudeau of wanting to turn Canada into an \u201cIslamic state\u201d.</p> <p>Such conspiracies date back to Trudeau\u2019s 2015 campaign pledge to bring in 25,000 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/24/canada-syrian-refugees-extra-time-do-it-right\">mostly Muslim refugees from war-torn Syria</a> by the end of the year.</p> <p>The move was a dramatic reversal from the previous Conservative government, which only agreed to increase the number of Syrian refugees admitted into Canada, from 1,300 to 10,000, provided <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/syrian-refugees-conservatives-focus-religion-ethnicity-1.3423323\">Syria\u2019s non-Muslim religious and ethnic minorities were prioritized.</a></p> <p>Soon after, the anti-Trudeau conspiracies began in earnest, echoing US \u201cbirthers\u201d who alleged Barack Obama was ineligible for office or was secretly a Muslim.</p> <p>By early 2016, a Toronto-based Facebook group was already speculating that Trudeau wanted to flood Canada\u2019s borders with immigrants from majority Muslim countries, either because he was ignorant to the dangers of radical Islam \u2013 or because he was a radical Islamist himself.</p> <p>\u201cThe best non-confidence statement,\u201d one site member opined, would be for Trudeau to be shot. Neither the conspiracy-mongering nor the threats have hampered the site\u2019s popularity. In 2016, it had 25,000 followers. Today it has nearly 235,000.</p> <p>The conspiracies only heightened when the Liberals introduced a non-binding motion condemning \u201cIslamophobia and all forms of systemic racism and religious discrimination\u201d \u2013 a move which Trudeau\u2019s opponents on the fringe right were convinced was proof of his government\u2019s fealty to radical Islam.</p> <p>Liberal MP Iqra Khalid, the motion\u2019s sponsor, was inundated with hate mail and death threats. Meanwhile, Canada\u2019s statistical agency, found that police-reported hate crime targeting Muslims increased by 151% in 2017.</p> <p>Now Muslim groups found themselves in a unique situation: criticizing both Trudeau for donning brownface, as well as his enemies on the far right who say he is secretly Muslim.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dd4daedc6474856e8f6ae9886372f1a3ea689d42\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd4daedc6474856e8f6ae9886372f1a3ea689d42/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Mislabeling someone as Muslim to castigate them is despicable.

      "bodyText": "The video shows a bearded imam purportedly heralding a plan by Justin Trudeau to implement sharia law in Canada, before cutting to an image of the prime minister sitting cross-legged in prayer amid a group of Muslim men. Shared widely on anti-Trudeau Facebook pages earlier this year, the clumsy montage was presented as evidence that Canada\u2019s 23rd prime minister is bent on subverting the judicial system to please Islamists \u2013 probably because he is a closeted Muslim himself. Trudeau was pilloried when images emerged of at least three instances in which he had donned blackface. Yet as Canada heads toward a general election, the prime minister has also become the subject of racist and Islamophobic conspiracy theories. And unlike the 2016 US election \u2013 in which a significant portion of online misinformation was created on Russian troll farms \u2013 much of the anti-Muslim propaganda aimed at Trudeau is produced and disseminated by Canadians. The video of the YouTube imam, for example, was uploaded by a prominent Ontario anti-Muslim activist, and then viewed, shared and liked on at least three anti-Trudeau Facebook pages with a collective reach exceeding 185,000. Dozens of videos on these pages are a conspiratorial pastiche in which Trudeau coddles Muslim extremists and throws open Canada\u2019s borders at the behest of George Soros. And they have been clicked almost 700,000 times. The eddies of such online outrage sometimes spread into the real world. At a town hall meeting in January, an audience member accused Trudeau of supporting Sharia law \u2013 before intimating that he should be hanged for treason. More recently, the Conservative party candidate Cameron Ogilvie stepped down after the activist group Press Progress unearthed social media posts in which Ogilvie shared a post accusing Trudeau of wanting to turn Canada into an \u201cIslamic state\u201d. Such conspiracies date back to Trudeau\u2019s 2015 campaign pledge to bring in 25,000 mostly Muslim refugees from war-torn Syria by the end of the year. The move was a dramatic reversal from the previous Conservative government, which only agreed to increase the number of Syrian refugees admitted into Canada, from 1,300 to 10,000, provided Syria\u2019s non-Muslim religious and ethnic minorities were prioritized. Soon after, the anti-Trudeau conspiracies began in earnest, echoing US \u201cbirthers\u201d who alleged Barack Obama was ineligible for office or was secretly a Muslim. By early 2016, a Toronto-based Facebook group was already speculating that Trudeau wanted to flood Canada\u2019s borders with immigrants from majority Muslim countries, either because he was ignorant to the dangers of radical Islam \u2013 or because he was a radical Islamist himself. \u201cThe best non-confidence statement,\u201d one site member opined, would be for Trudeau to be shot. Neither the conspiracy-mongering nor the threats have hampered the site\u2019s popularity. In 2016, it had 25,000 followers. Today it has nearly 235,000. The conspiracies only heightened when the Liberals introduced a non-binding motion condemning \u201cIslamophobia and all forms of systemic racism and religious discrimination\u201d \u2013 a move which Trudeau\u2019s opponents on the fringe right were convinced was proof of his government\u2019s fealty to radical Islam. Liberal MP Iqra Khalid, the motion\u2019s sponsor, was inundated with hate mail and death threats. Meanwhile, Canada\u2019s statistical agency, found that police-reported hate crime targeting Muslims increased by 151% in 2017. Now Muslim groups found themselves in a unique situation: criticizing both Trudeau for donning brownface, as well as his enemies on the far right who say he is secretly Muslim. \u201cIt was disheartening to see the prime minister engage in blackface/brownface,\u201d said Mustafa Farooq, Executive Director of the National Council of Canadian Muslims. \u201cThat said, mislabelling someone as Muslim to castigate them is despicable. It engages in a longstanding hateful mythology about the Muslim community.\u201d That Canadians should be the source of this should not be a surprise: contrary to prevailing stereotypes, recent polling suggests many Canadians are a politely jingoistic bunch who are inclined to believe that immigrants in general, and Muslims in particular, are too numerous above the 49th parallel. One poll,found 41% of Canadians believe there are too many immigrants in the country \u2013 and more than 60% of self-described Conservatives say there are too many visible minorities here. Many of the far right\u2019s most prominent provocateurs are Canadians, including Faith Goldy, Stefan Molyneux and Lauren Southern \u2013 who was banned from Facebook earlier this year. A 2018 report by the country\u2019s intelligence agency found that Canadians who hold extreme rightwing views \u2013 including Islamophobia, anti-immigration and white nationalism \u2013 actively use chat forums and social media. \u201cThese individuals leverage online chats and forums in attempt to create an online culture of fear, hatred and mistrust by exploiting real or imagined concerns,\u201d the report found. \u201cWe strongly expect much of this kind of content to be domestic,\u201d said Taylor Owen, director of the Digital Democracy Project, which is monitoring instances of mis- and disinformation ahead of the election. \u201cAs in the EU parliamentary elections, domestic groups saw the tools and tactics which worked for Russia in the US election and simply co-opted them.\u201d All of this has kept fact-checkers busy. The CBC, the country\u2019s public broadcaster, has devoted seven journalists to fact check stories, ads, posts and other media that could have an impact on the election. Earlier this year, the Agence France-Presse news agency debunked a widely circulated story which said the Trudeau government had \u201cpleaded\u201d the Nigerian government to send one million immigrants to Canada. (The same site had Trudeau making similar requests of six other countries.) Yet the tide of anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant rhetoric persists, seemingly spurring the nativist impulses of some mainstream Canadian politicians. In Quebec, Canada\u2019s second-most populous province, the government led by the populist Coalition Avenir Qu\u00e9bec has reduced the number of incoming immigrants by 20%, despite the province\u2019s aging population and corresponding labour shortage. The CAQ also passed a \u201claicity\u201d law banning religious symbols from the bodies of certain government workers, which many see as disproportionately affecting Muslim women in the workplace. Last fall, the former Conservative MP Maxime Bernier launched a populist party that will field a full slate of candidates in the upcoming election. Bernier regularly berates Trudeau\u2019s \u201ccult of diversity\u201d, wants to \u201cmake Canada great again\u201d and shares videos from advocates of the baseless \u201cQAnon\u201d conspiracy theory that Donald Trump is battling a global cabal of elite liberal paedophiles. Bernier recently made the evidence-free claim that Islamic extremists have infiltrated Canadian politics, a contention pushed by one of the largest anti-Trudeau sites in the country. In less than a year, his thinly concealed dog-whistling has attracted notorious white nationalists and Canada\u2019s alt-right movement \u2013 as well as 5% of Canadian voters, according to one poll.",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s a balmy autumn afternoon and Jpegmafia is laughing about the many online, white alt-right men who seem to be triggered by lines such as \u201cPistol whip \u2019em, I can\u2019t waste the bullet in a poser/Incels gettin\u2019 crossed \u2019cause I crossed over/How they go from Anne Hathaway to Ann Coulter?\u201d \u201cThis shit be breaking niggas,\u201d he says giddily, almost beaming with pride. \u201cThey be on Reddit spilling they feelings and shit. They can\u2019t deal with it.\u201d While his flair for riling up online edgelords is a recent discovery, the 29-year-old rapper and producer has been tinkering with his sound for more than a decade. Last year he finally broke through with his album, Veteran, bracing noise-rap with a radical lyrical agenda, rife with references to anime and video games, and jabs at everyone from Donald Trump\u2019s counsellor Kellyanne Conway to the television host and comedian Bill Maher. He has just released the more melodic, but only occasionally less aggro, new album All My Heroes Are Cornballs. It is a left turn that is a stunning expansion of his punk ethos \u2013 pushing his anti-establishment rhetoric to the brink, promoting a DIY ingenuity, embracing the counterculture \u2013 and yet another provocation. Jpegmafia was born Barrington Hendricks in Brooklyn, New York. In his song Williamsburg, Jpeg reprimands the gentrifiers taking over the borough: \u201cWe taking Brooklyn back/You can leave the coffee,\u201d he snarls. The irony of the fact that we are chatting in a coworking space in the Brooklyn area of Williamsburg called the Brass Factory, which has been converted from a real brass factory, is not lost on the rapper. His career has been about embracing contradictions, making noise music pushing a militant agenda of black self-defence to confused white audiences \u2013 radical rap to mosh to. Jpeg has been accused of being a troll or provocateur, but his rage raps are unambiguous about where his fury is from and where it is aimed. \u201cIf you listen to my music, you know who I\u2019m talking to, what I\u2019m talking about, and exactly what my message is,\u201d he says, wearing his signature black and red bandanna, combat boots and a T-shirt splicing the Gucci logo with the Rainbow Fish children\u2019s book character. \u201cThe only people who misinterpret it is goofy white niggas. People attach words like \u2018edgy\u2019 and shit like that to me. It\u2019s like yo, when has it ever been edgy for a black person to talk about black issues? Just because I\u2019m not doing it the way Common is, where I\u2019m like, \u2018Hug your mom\u2019 and shit.\u201d He pauses briefly, then smirks. \u201cBut also goofy white niggas come to my shows, so.\u201d Jpeg got the creative spark aged 12, listening to the Cam\u2019ron album Come Home With Me at a friend\u2019s house. \u201cIt had a chipmunk [sped up] soul sample in it and I\u2019d never heard that before. It freaked me out. I thought it was the best shit I\u2019d ever heard.\u201d At 13, he was uprooted to Alabama, in the deep south, a jarring transition that provided an education in racism. \u201cI had to deal with a lot of vitriol immediately,\u201d he recalls. \u201cIt benefited me in a way because it just made me hard.\u201d To escape, he enlisted in the military at 18. He served one term in the US Air Force, during which he was deployed to Iraq, Kuwait, Afghanistan, North Africa and Japan. He says being poor and black is all that prompted him to join up. \u201cA recruiter came to school and I was like, \u2018I have no other option, I can either die here or ... at least this will get me out of my situation,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not some patriot. I didn\u2019t have some yearning to defend my country or anything. I was poor. And I was taken advantage of, really.\u201d He remembers his time overseas as \u201cextremely scary\u201d and the military as a club of dick-swinging jocks.

He had a computer and made beats in tiny spaces under the immense stress of intermittent combat.

He would spend whole weekends listening to anything he had managed to download: Kanye\u2019s My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, Wiz Khalifa\u2019s Kush &amp; Orange Juice, Rick Ross\u2019s Teflon Don; Ariel Pink, country music. With an eclectic and voracious musical appetite, he started releasing music as Devon Hendryx in 2011. After a string of unsuccessful rap mixtapes, he turned to making lo-fi \u201cfreak folk\u201d as Ghost Pop. \u201cThat\u2019s the most unconfident album I ever made,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s all depressed and suicidal. That\u2019s the last time I think I ever drop my guard on record.\u201d He cut his teeth doing live shows at small house parties in Japan. What little buzz the band garnered locally made him feel validated in his decision to pursue music. Hendricks changed his name to Jpegmafia, moved to Baltimore and was there during a series of riots sparked by the death of Freddie Gray, a young black man who fell into a coma while he was being transported in a police van. \u201cIt was a ghost town.

      "body": "<p>Last Saturday, as the players came out before the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/28/everton-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">home game against Manchester City</a>, Everton\u2019s fans unveiled an enormous flag bearing the face of Moise Kean and the slogan \u201cno al razzismo\u201d \u2013 no to racism. On Wednesday the Football Association <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/02/bernardo-silva-charged-fa-benjamin-mendy-tweet-ban-manchester-city\" title=\"\">charged the City midfielder Bernardo Silva</a> with misconduct, relating to a tweet he published comparing a childhood picture of his teammate Benjamin Mendy to the cartoon used as a logo by the Spanish chocolate brand Conguitos. Everton\u2019s banner impressed me as an example of purposeful action that might change behaviour and make racism less prevalent in football; but the FA charge of Silva looks like a token gesture compared with the weak punishments of public racism in other areas of the game.</p> <p>Silva\u2019s tweet was definitely problematic. The depiction of black people as animalistic or ugly or lesser is not acceptable, and the physical similarity between the Conguitos logo and Mendy is minimal. But at the same time Silva and Mendy are good friends and teammates. When you communicate with friends you let your guard down, you speak with more familiarity, and from time to time you say things that you probably would not say to a stranger.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/sep/29/racism-football-fifa-scourge-trangressors\">Football\u2019s diverse landscape remains polluted by racists despite our outrage  | Andrew Anthony</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I would guess that most of us have sent things to friends on WhatsApp that would make us very embarrassed if they were published. Silva\u2019s main mistake was to tweet it to the world. But though Silva might not have intended to be racist, ignorance is never an adequate excuse.</p> <p>Action had to be taken.<strong> </strong>City missed the opportunity to calm the controversy when instead of getting Silva to immediately apologise for any public offence he caused, Pep Guardiola mistakenly came out and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/25/guardiola-defends-bernardo-silva-mendy-tweet-fa-manchester-city\" title=\"\">dismissed the suggestion</a> that the tweet was racist. This was a demonstration of one of the key problems preventing us from effectively combatting racism: so many people do not actually understand what it is.</p> <p>It is not simply name-calling and physical abuse. The character on the Conguitos logo, which before a relatively recent redesign used to carry a tribal spear, is similar to the kind of images that have been used to degrade black people since slavery, which means comparing it to any black person is unacceptable. Similar cartoons of white children simply do not have the same degrading connotations. No one ever got offended by the Milkybar Kid.</p> <p>Silva might not have known that in this country if you publish a picture of a black person depicted in a certain way there is going to be a backlash, and that backlash will then have to be addressed. The FA has stepped in but now the problem is one of consistency.</p> <p>The issue of Silva publishing a single unintended racist tweet about a teammate will not have a significant impact on British society.

      "bodyText": "Last Saturday, as the players came out before the home game against Manchester City, Everton\u2019s fans unveiled an enormous flag bearing the face of Moise Kean and the slogan \u201cno al razzismo\u201d \u2013 no to racism. On Wednesday the Football Association charged the City midfielder Bernardo Silva with misconduct, relating to a tweet he published comparing a childhood picture of his teammate Benjamin Mendy to the cartoon used as a logo by the Spanish chocolate brand Conguitos. Everton\u2019s banner impressed me as an example of purposeful action that might change behaviour and make racism less prevalent in football; but the FA charge of Silva looks like a token gesture compared with the weak punishments of public racism in other areas of the game. Silva\u2019s tweet was definitely problematic. The depiction of black people as animalistic or ugly or lesser is not acceptable, and the physical similarity between the Conguitos logo and Mendy is minimal. But at the same time Silva and Mendy are good friends and teammates. When you communicate with friends you let your guard down, you speak with more familiarity, and from time to time you say things that you probably would not say to a stranger. I would guess that most of us have sent things to friends on WhatsApp that would make us very embarrassed if they were published. Silva\u2019s main mistake was to tweet it to the world. But though Silva might not have intended to be racist, ignorance is never an adequate excuse. Action had to be taken. City missed the opportunity to calm the controversy when instead of getting Silva to immediately apologise for any public offence he caused, Pep Guardiola mistakenly came out and dismissed the suggestion that the tweet was racist. This was a demonstration of one of the key problems preventing us from effectively combatting racism: so many people do not actually understand what it is. It is not simply name-calling and physical abuse. The character on the Conguitos logo, which before a relatively recent redesign used to carry a tribal spear, is similar to the kind of images that have been used to degrade black people since slavery, which means comparing it to any black person is unacceptable. Similar cartoons of white children simply do not have the same degrading connotations. No one ever got offended by the Milkybar Kid. Silva might not have known that in this country if you publish a picture of a black person depicted in a certain way there is going to be a backlash, and that backlash will then have to be addressed. The FA has stepped in but now the problem is one of consistency. The issue of Silva publishing a single unintended racist tweet about a teammate will not have a significant impact on British society. When large numbers of fans sing chants featuring racist language \u2013 like the incident I mentioned in a previous column that led to Millwall being fined \u00a310,000 in August \u2013 the punishments are feeble. When there is an opportunity to force fans and clubs to confront the issue and to encourage behavioural change, the FA does not take it.

The dish that I can\u2019t quite forget was a plentiful bowl of fat gnocchi bullets, hand-formed that morning and served with fresh courgettes and a pungent, almond-and-cashew pesto. When experts wonder why large Italian chains on the high street have started to get into difficulty, I think it\u2019s because many customers have simply begun to see that they deserve better for their money. A slice of Bottega Caruso\u2019s fresh, boozy tiramisu, by contrast, costs \u00a36.50, and every spoonful of rum-and-espresso-soaked sponge, thick with cream, that you lift to your lips reminds you why independent Italians do it better, especially when they\u2019re Simona, Harry and the gang. As the great philosopher Chas Hodge once said, \u201cYou can keep your Costa Brava and all that palaver, going no farther, me, I\u2019d rather have me a day down Margate with all me family.\u201d \u2022 Bottega Caruso 2-4 Broad Street, Margate, Kent, 01843 297142.

Things are so serious that comedians are becoming politicians. Why? Have we lost our funny bone? When did everyone start taking themselves so seriously? Saturday marks the 50th anniversary of the first episode of Monty Python\u2019s Flying Circus. In honour, the Upside has been trawling around, looking for the new Ernest Scribblers of this very earnest age. You can read our suggestions in What we liked, below. But first, a quick round-up of top Upside offerings of the week: 1. The women taking the plastic out of periods. Two-minute read. 2. Why Finland\u2019s schools are so great. Three-minute read. 3. How the participatory budget in Paris works. Three-minute read. 4. Hitching to work: could it catch on? One-hour commute. What we liked My colleague Marina Hyde is always funny \u2013 though be warned: she is fabulously rude too. A jolly Sydney Morning Herald piece ripped into a new TV hit. There was plenty of value to be had in a British prime minister mentioning \u201ckangaroo\u2019s testicles\u201d in a speech. A pub had a party at which everyone was called Nigel. The Economist had fun examining the far-fetched prospect of Donald Trump\u2019s border moat. One-minute read (paywall). The New Yorker still maintains a daily commitment to satire. A protest stunt backfired \u2013 literally (video). Lucky numbers Long one of the most alcoholic nations in the world, Russia has become more abstemious over the past decade and a half, with booze consumption falling by almost half. Longevity has increased by 10% over the period from 65 to about 71. In the UK meanwhile, deaths from breast cancer have almost halved over the past 30 years. What we heard Mich\u00e8le Sanniti inquired via email: I would love to read an article on what can be done about the huge amount of plastic that we generate everyday by using milk and orange juice cartons. Alternatives, campaigns, are the supermarkets working on this? Well, of course we have written various pieces on this, for example here, here and here. Still on the theme of all that unnecessary plastic: Thanks for a great article about environmentally sound menstruation products. I have been using the same 6 pads since 2002 or thereabouts. They are in cotton, and I just wash them in the washing machine and then use them again. They have little buttons on their wings to keep them tethered during use. Probably not great for the manufacturer, but multi-use pads is probably by far the most environmentally friendly menstrual protection. Name supplied Where was the Upside? Out in the Pacific, where a new technology finally looked like it might work Thanks for reading. Tell us where you see the Upside by writing to theupside@theguardian.com. Have a great weekend",

      "bodyText": "New Zealand\u2019s foreign affairs minister has hinted at a softening in Australia\u2019s stance on deporting Kiwi nationals who have committed crimes in Australia, after bilateral meetings in Sydney. Winston Peters told media on Friday afternoon he had \u201creasons to believe\u201d the Australian government\u2019s bill to strengthen character test visa provisions was not \u201cfixed in stone at this point in time\u201d and could accommodate New Zealand\u2019s requests. The bill to change the Migration Act proposes expanding the grounds for automatically refusing or cancelling a visa to include non-citizens who have been convicted of a crime which carries a minimum two-year prison term \u2013 regardless of of their actual sentence. This has been a point of contention with New Zealand, particularly after expert advice that it could increase the number of New Zealander visa cancellations five-fold. \u201cWe\u2019re having discussions about an improved circumstance on that issue \u2026 and the proposal is not fixed in stone at this point in time,\u201d Peters said. \u201cWe seek to be optimistic about this, to get a better outcome than the one we\u2019ve currently got, and we\u2019re hopeful that that is going to happen, and thus far we\u2019ve got reasons to believe it will happen.\u201d Asked if he had been given reason to believed the bill would not pass in its current form, Peters said: \u201cI could take a pretty serious bet I\u2019m right on that.\u201d Under existing laws Australia has deported thousands of non-citizens, more than half of them from New Zealand. Frequently these are people who have lived in Australia since early childhood and who have no social or family connection to New Zealand. New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has called the policy \u201ccorrosive\u201d to the bilateral relationship. It has also seen people deported who are of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander heritage. Peters was in Australia for the latest of the bi-annual Australia-New Zealand foreign minister consultations, with his Australian counterpart, Marise Payne. Standing alongside Peters at the press conference, Payne added the two countries were working \u201cvery hard to work cooperatively to manage these issues between Australia and New Zealand\u201d. \u201cToday\u2019s discussions were a representation of that and I look forward to that continuing,\u201d she said. New Zealand has for some time been lobbying Australia to have reciprocal arrangements when it comes to New Zealanders, including \u201cspecial consideration\u201d for New Zealanders and a return to a 10-year threshold. Under that rule New Zealand accepts it has a a responsibility for a person who has lived there for 10 years or more, and does not deport them. \u201cOver time in a country a person is socialised into that country, into the norms of that country and the behaviour of that country,\u201d New Zealand\u2019s high commissioner, Annette King, told a Senate inquiry in August. \u201cWe believe that, after a period of time, they have become part of New Zealand and therefore we have a responsibility to take account of the time they\u2019ve been in New Zealand and the fact that they have become New Zealanders, as permanent residents.\u201d Should the Australian government accept the changes sought by New Zealand, it would not change the impact of the proposed law on people of other nationalities. The bill, which passed through the house of representatives in September and is yet to be debated in the Senate, is currently opposed by Labor, the Greens and Centre Alliance. The immigration minister, David Coleman, rejected changes demanded by Labor in return for its support \u2013 including special consideration for New Zealanders, making it non-retrospective, and exempting low level offences with a threshold of an actual 12-month minimum sentence. Coleman said any increase to visa cancellations as a result of the bill was \u201cby design\u201d. Asked to respond to Peters\u2019s remarks, Coleman told Guardian Australia the government\u2019s priority was keeping Australians safe \u201cand we make no apologies for that\u201d. \u201cThis important legislation applies to all visa holders irrespective of their nationality, and will capture people convicted of serious crimes, including violent crimes, sexual assault, firearms offences, or breaching a family violence order,\u201d he said. \u201cIf people who are not Australian citizens have committed these serious offences, then objectively they should fail the character test.\u201d",

Sure any old DJ can trigger loops on music software Ableton, but Fenton does that while moving from keyboards to drums to guitar to \u2013 and why not? \u2013 the saxophone.

Alongside the recitals, the theme is explored in lectures and storytelling from a range of folk traditions. The main focus, as usual, is on 19th- and early 20th-century song. Oxford lieder has now appointed its first associate composer, Cheryl Frances-Hoad, whose music will be featured over the next three years; her setting of extracts from Beowulf, in Seamus Heaney\u2019s translation, is included in a recital on the opening afternoon. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.oxfordlieder.co.uk/\">Various venues, Friday 11 to 26 October</a></em></p> <h2>The Silver Lake</h2> <p>Kurt Weill\u2019s \u201cplay with music\u201d was his last work performed in Germany before he emigrated in 1933. Although The Silver Lake is sometimes claimed as Weill\u2019s masterpiece, performances have been rare, because of the work\u2019s ambitious mix of words and music. English Touring Opera\u2019s staging, its first of Weill, is directed by James Conway and conducted by James Holmes, and stars Ronald Samm, David Webb and Luci Briginshaw alongside choirs drawn from the venues\u2019 local areas. <br><em><a href=\"http://englishtouringopera.org.uk/productions/the-silver-lake\">Hackney Empire, E8, Saturday 5 &amp; Monday 7 October; touring to 15 November</a></em></p> <h2>Rigoletto</h2> <p>Verdi\u2019s operas are a relatively recent addition at Glyndebourne. But after productions of La Traviata and Falstaff, it now adds Rigoletto to its repertory, in a production by Christiane Lutz presented first by Glyndebourne Touring Opera. Nikoloz Lagvilava takes the title role, with Vuvu Mpofu as Gilda and Matteo Lippi as the Duke. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.glyndebourne.com/events/rigoletto/\">Glyndebourne Opera House, Lewes, Friday 11 October to 2 November; touring to 7 December</a></em></p> <p><em>AC</em></p> <h2><strong>Five of the best \u2026 exhibitions</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"340ede1874e42aaf913890058365212428bb31e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/340ede1874e42aaf913890058365212428bb31e8/12_10_4689_3686/1000.jpg\" alt=\"William Hogarth\u2019s An Election I, 1754\" width=\"1000\" height=\"786\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">William Hogarth\u2019s An Election I, 1754.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 The Trustees of Sir John Soane\u2019s Museum</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Gauguin Portraits</h2> <p>The first self-conscious modernist was not Picasso or Matisse but Paul Gauguin. He embraced abstract art boldly when others were still edging delicately towards it. The colours in his paintings are purely expressive and his studies of people daringly stylised. This should be a rich and strange encounter with a prophet of poetic mystery. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/exhibitions/the-credit-suisse-exhibition-gauguin-portraits\">The National Gallery, WC2 Monday 7 October to 26 January</a></em></p> <h2>Hogarth: Place and Progress</h2> <p>London is still recognisable as the city where Hogarth\u2019s rakes, thieves, murderers and politicians rose and fell in his paintings and engravings of \u201cmodern moral subjects\u201d. This exhibition brings together his great visual narratives in a Georgian museum a stone\u2019s throw from the Bloomsbury location of Gin Lane. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.soane.org/whats-on/exhibitions/hogarth-place-and-progress\">Sir John Soane\u2019s Museum, WC2, Wednesday 9 October to 5 January</a></em></p> <h2>Elizabeth Peyton</h2> <p>The portraits of Elizabeth Peyton are lyrically sensual homages to famous faces. She turns fan art into high culture. Whether she is painting Kurt Cobain, David Bowie, Frida Kahlo or the Queen, her real theme is not so much the real person as the fantasies we lavish on them. That makes her a must for the NPG\u2019s remorseless campaign to redefine itself as a cool contemporary global gallery. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.npg.org.uk/whatson/exhibitions/2019/elizabeth-peyton/\">National Portrait Gallery, WC2, to 5 January</a></em></p> <h2>Into the Night: Cabarets &amp; Clubs in Modern Art</h2> <p>Max Beckmann\u2019s painting Die Nacht (The Night) imagines the darkness of the 20th century through a vision of a grotesque cabaret of sado-masochism. This exhibition is more celebratory, seeing nightlife from Vienna to Harlem as an energetic driver of modern art. It is a rich theme. Dada started at Zurich\u2019s Cabaret Voltaire, Picasso took drugs at the Lapin Agile, and Andy Warhol made Studio 54 Warholian. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.barbican.org.uk/whats-on/2019/event/into-the-night-cabarets-clubs-in-modern-art\">Barbican Art Gallery, EC2, to 19 January</a></em></p> <h2>Rembrandt in Print</h2> <p>You can make a case that Rembrandt\u2019s prints are even greater than his paintings. The way he etches texture with gathered lines and creates huge areas of inky blackness is astonishingly adventurous. There\u2019s not much in modern art more radical than the near-abstract darkness of his Three Crosses or the pathos of Ecce Homo. This is where expressionism started. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.holburne.org/events/rembrandt-in-print/\">The Holburne Museum, Bath, to 5 January</a></em></p> <p><em>JJ</em></p> <h2><strong>Five of the best \u2026 theatre shows</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea392ce31345f17611e5968a39fe99964c57a8d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea392ce31345f17611e5968a39fe99964c57a8d6/21_0_3458_2074/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Preludes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Preludes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott Rylander</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Preludes</h2> <p>This is your last chance to catch this word-of-mouth hit musical. It is written by Dave Malloy, a true original, best known for penning Natasha, Pierre &amp; the Great Comet of 1812. The show is about the Russian composer Rachmaninov, who plunged into depression at the height of his fame but was saved by hypnotherapy. Alex Sutton\u2019s production mesmerises: a theatrical trip for the senses. <br><em><a href=\"https://southwarkplayhouse.co.uk/show/preludes/\">Southwark Playhouse, SE1 to 12 October</a></em></p> <h2>Vassa</h2> <p>Another month, another intriguing opening at the Almeida. This time, Mike Bartlett (Doctor Foster/King Charles III) has adapted Maxim Gorky\u2019s not-so-well-known dark comedy Vassa. It is about a family and a country on the brink of huge upheaval. Director Tinuke Craig makes her Almeida debut; Siobhan Redmond plays matriarch Vassa. <br><em><a href=\"https://almeida.co.uk/whats-on/vassa/7-oct-2019-23-nov-2019\">Almeida Theatre, N1, Sat to 23 November</a></em></p> <h2>The Beauty Queen of Leenane</h2> <p>Martin McDonagh is perhaps best known for the film Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri but he is also one hell of a playwright. His work is a dizzying combination of tender, funny and brutal. The Beauty Queen of Leenane is set in Galway, where 40-year-old Maureen lives with her manipulative mother Mag. Will Maureen find the escape she pines for in the shape of new suitor Pato Dooley? Maggie McCarthy and Siobhan O\u2019Kelly star. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.hulltruck.co.uk/whats-on/drama/the-beauty-queen-of-leenane/\">Hull Truck Theatre, to 26</a>; <a href=\"https://www.queens-theatre.co.uk/whats-on/show/the-beauty-queen-of-leeanne/\">Queen\u2019s Theatre, Hornchurch, 30 October to 16 November</a></em></p> <h2>Roundabout festival</h2> <p>Paines Plough\u2019s celebrated pop-up theatre Roundabout springs up at Theatre Royal Stratford East. It will host a run of Edinburgh hits, including Charley Miles\u2019s insightful new play Daughterhood and Nathan Bryon\u2019s family adventure story Dexter and Winter\u2019s Detective Agency. There\u2019s also grime- and hip-hop-inspired gig theatre, improv, burlesque and beatboxing. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.stratfordeast.com/whats-on/all-shows/roundabout-festival\">Theatre Royal Stratford East, E15, Thursday 10 to 26 October</a></em></p> <h2>The Niceties</h2> <p>America. 2016. Two women meet to review a university history paper. The question: has the nation reached the moment for radical revolution? A cerebral conversation turns into a passionate debate about race, and a private conversation triggers a very public battle. Following a hit run off-Broadway, Eleanor Burgess\u2019s pertinent play receives its European premiere. Janie Dee, best known for her musical prowess, stars alongside Moronke Akinola. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.finboroughtheatre.co.uk/productions/2019/the-niceties.php\">Finborough Theatre, SW10, to 26 October</a></em></p> <p><em>MG</em></p> <h2><strong>Three of the best \u2026 dance shows</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7189114ba44640ecb76fb690cb5ee3e7cfc21549\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7189114ba44640ecb76fb690cb5ee3e7cfc21549/103_151_1583_950/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dance Umbrella festival\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dance Umbrella festival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laurent Philippe/PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Dance Umbrella</h2> <p>October has somehow become the month of leftfield dance festivals, from Birmingham (Fierce) to Nottingham (Nottdance) to Liverpool (Leap).

Oxford, Tuesday 8; Glasgow, Wednesday 9; Newcastle upon Tyne, Thursday 10; touring to 25 October FKJ French house pioneer Vincent Fenton, AKA French Kiwi Juice or just FKJ for short, has built up a real reputation in the live arena. Sure any old DJ can trigger loops on music software Ableton, but Fenton does that while moving from keyboards to drums to guitar to \u2013 and why not? \u2013 the saxophone. Expect to be amazed, and frustrated you messed about during music lessons at school. O2 Academy Brixton, SW9, Thursday 10; Albert Hall, Manchester, Friday 11 MC Carla Bley Trio The infallible musical trio led by reputed octogenarian US composer-pianist Carla Bley \u2013 with bass guitarist Steve Swallow and UK sax star Andy Sheppard \u2013 always seem to be playing the distilled essence of an even richer jazz story going on in their heads. They play that quirky edit on these two rare UK gigs. Kings Place, N1, Monday 7; Turner Sims Concert Hall, Southampton, Tuesday 8 October JF Three of the best \u2026 classical concerts Oxford lieder festival \u201cTales of Beyond: Magic, Myths and Mortals\u201d is the title of the 18th Oxford lieder festival, the annual celebration of vocal music. Alongside the recitals, the theme is explored in lectures and storytelling from a range of folk traditions. The main focus, as usual, is on 19th- and early 20th-century song. Oxford lieder has now appointed its first associate composer, Cheryl Frances-Hoad, whose music will be featured over the next three years; her setting of extracts from Beowulf, in Seamus Heaney\u2019s translation, is included in a recital on the opening afternoon. Various venues, Friday 11 to 26 October The Silver Lake Kurt Weill\u2019s \u201cplay with music\u201d was his last work performed in Germany before he emigrated in 1933. Although The Silver Lake is sometimes claimed as Weill\u2019s masterpiece, performances have been rare, because of the work\u2019s ambitious mix of words and music. English Touring Opera\u2019s staging, its first of Weill, is directed by James Conway and conducted by James Holmes, and stars Ronald Samm, David Webb and Luci Briginshaw alongside choirs drawn from the venues\u2019 local areas. Hackney Empire, E8, Saturday 5 &amp; Monday 7 October; touring to 15 November Rigoletto Verdi\u2019s operas are a relatively recent addition at Glyndebourne. But after productions of La Traviata and Falstaff, it now adds Rigoletto to its repertory, in a production by Christiane Lutz presented first by Glyndebourne Touring Opera. Nikoloz Lagvilava takes the title role, with Vuvu Mpofu as Gilda and Matteo Lippi as the Duke. Glyndebourne Opera House, Lewes, Friday 11 October to 2 November; touring to 7 December AC Five of the best \u2026 exhibitions Gauguin Portraits The first self-conscious modernist was not Picasso or Matisse but Paul Gauguin. He embraced abstract art boldly when others were still edging delicately towards it. The colours in his paintings are purely expressive and his studies of people daringly stylised. This should be a rich and strange encounter with a prophet of poetic mystery. The National Gallery, WC2 Monday 7 October to 26 January Hogarth: Place and Progress London is still recognisable as the city where Hogarth\u2019s rakes, thieves, murderers and politicians rose and fell in his paintings and engravings of \u201cmodern moral subjects\u201d. This exhibition brings together his great visual narratives in a Georgian museum a stone\u2019s throw from the Bloomsbury location of Gin Lane. Sir John Soane\u2019s Museum, WC2, Wednesday 9 October to 5 January Elizabeth Peyton The portraits of Elizabeth Peyton are lyrically sensual homages to famous faces. She turns fan art into high culture. Whether she is painting Kurt Cobain, David Bowie, Frida Kahlo or the Queen, her real theme is not so much the real person as the fantasies we lavish on them. That makes her a must for the NPG\u2019s remorseless campaign to redefine itself as a cool contemporary global gallery. National Portrait Gallery, WC2, to 5 January Into the Night: Cabarets &amp; Clubs in Modern Art Max Beckmann\u2019s painting Die Nacht (The Night) imagines the darkness of the 20th century through a vision of a grotesque cabaret of sado-masochism. This exhibition is more celebratory, seeing nightlife from Vienna to Harlem as an energetic driver of modern art. It is a rich theme. Dada started at Zurich\u2019s Cabaret Voltaire, Picasso took drugs at the Lapin Agile, and Andy Warhol made Studio 54 Warholian. Barbican Art Gallery, EC2, to 19 January Rembrandt in Print You can make a case that Rembrandt\u2019s prints are even greater than his paintings. The way he etches texture with gathered lines and creates huge areas of inky blackness is astonishingly adventurous. There\u2019s not much in modern art more radical than the near-abstract darkness of his Three Crosses or the pathos of Ecce Homo. This is where expressionism started. The Holburne Museum, Bath, to 5 January JJ Five of the best \u2026 theatre shows Preludes This is your last chance to catch this word-of-mouth hit musical. It is written by Dave Malloy, a true original, best known for penning Natasha, Pierre &amp; the Great Comet of 1812. The show is about the Russian composer Rachmaninov, who plunged into depression at the height of his fame but was saved by hypnotherapy. Alex Sutton\u2019s production mesmerises: a theatrical trip for the senses. Southwark Playhouse, SE1 to 12 October Vassa Another month, another intriguing opening at the Almeida. This time, Mike Bartlett (Doctor Foster/King Charles III) has adapted Maxim Gorky\u2019s not-so-well-known dark comedy Vassa. It is about a family and a country on the brink of huge upheaval. Director Tinuke Craig makes her Almeida debut; Siobhan Redmond plays matriarch Vassa. Almeida Theatre, N1, Sat to 23 November The Beauty Queen of Leenane Martin McDonagh is perhaps best known for the film Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri but he is also one hell of a playwright. His work is a dizzying combination of tender, funny and brutal. The Beauty Queen of Leenane is set in Galway, where 40-year-old Maureen lives with her manipulative mother Mag. Will Maureen find the escape she pines for in the shape of new suitor Pato Dooley? Maggie McCarthy and Siobhan O\u2019Kelly star. Hull Truck Theatre, to 26; Queen\u2019s Theatre, Hornchurch, 30 October to 16 November Roundabout festival Paines Plough\u2019s celebrated pop-up theatre Roundabout springs up at Theatre Royal Stratford East. It will host a run of Edinburgh hits, including Charley Miles\u2019s insightful new play Daughterhood and Nathan Bryon\u2019s family adventure story Dexter and Winter\u2019s Detective Agency. There\u2019s also grime- and hip-hop-inspired gig theatre, improv, burlesque and beatboxing. Theatre Royal Stratford East, E15, Thursday 10 to 26 October The Niceties America. 2016. Two women meet to review a university history paper. The question: has the nation reached the moment for radical revolution? A cerebral conversation turns into a passionate debate about race, and a private conversation triggers a very public battle. Following a hit run off-Broadway, Eleanor Burgess\u2019s pertinent play receives its European premiere. Janie Dee, best known for her musical prowess, stars alongside Moronke Akinola. Finborough Theatre, SW10, to 26 October MG Three of the best \u2026 dance shows Dance Umbrella October has somehow become the month of leftfield dance festivals, from Birmingham (Fierce) to Nottingham (Nottdance) to Liverpool (Leap). But leading the pack is the brilliant Dance Umbrella, which opens with Franco-Austrian artist Gis\u00e8le Vienne\u2019s Crowd (Sadler\u2019s Wells, EC1, Tue &amp; Wed), inspired by early-90s clubbing in East Berlin. Various venues, London Tuesday 8 to 27 October Dance International Glasgow An intriguing lineup of forward-thinking dance and performance includes Trajal Harrell, whose work has more layers than Jennifer Aniston\u2019s Friends haircut, and Louise Ahl, AKA Ultimate Dancer, with a piece of \u201cfeminist alchemy\u201d lasting just over six hours. Various venues, to 26 October The Royal Ballet: New Pam Tanowitz Critics went crazy for US choreographer Pam Tanowitz\u2019s London debut in May with her version of TS Eliot\u2019s Four Quartets. Now she gets her first Royal Ballet commission in a triple bill also featuring Merce Cunningham\u2019s Cross Currents. Royal Opera House: Linbury Theatre, WC2, Thursday 10 &amp; Friday 11 LW \u2022 This article was amended on 4 Oct. Siobhan Redmond has replaced Samantha Bond in Vassa.",

The RBA\u2019s financial stability review, released Friday, concluded that while climate change is not yet a significant threat to financial stability in Australia, it is becoming increasingly important for investors and institutions to actively manage carbon risk. The bank notes Australian insurers are the most directly exposed to the physical impacts of climate change, and points out that inflation-adjusted insurance claims for natural disasters this decade are more than twice what they were in the previous 10 years. It notes \u201cthis impact is likely to grow over time\u201d. \u201cAn increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters will increase the incidence of damage to, or destruction of, physical assets that are insured or used as collateral,\u201d the RBA said. \u201cAssets that are exposed to increasing physical risk \u2013 such as property located in bushfire-prone or coastal areas \u2013 could decline in value, particularly if these risks become uninsurable. \u201cClimate change could also reduce certain types of business income that is used to service loans. Examples include changing rainfall patterns that result in lower or less predictable income from agriculture, more frequent storms disrupting supply chains and therefore sales, and damage to natural assets that reduces tourism income.\u201d The RBA says banks and other lending institutions are also exposed to physical risks because climate change can result in a decline in the income or value of collateral that they are lending against. It says Australian financial institutions that have exposure to carbon-intensive industries \u2013 such as power generation and mining, or to energy-intensive firms \u2013 \u201cwill also be exposed to transition risk\u201d. \u201cTransition risk will be greatest for banks that lend to firms in carbon-intensive industries and to individuals or businesses that are reliant on these firms,\u201d the bank said. \u201cOther financial institutions investing in carbon-intensive industries, such as superannuation and investment funds, are also exposed to the risk that climate change will diminish the value of their investments. This could occur both through direct investments in carbon-intensive industries, or indirect investments in banks that lend to these industries\u201d. It warns financial institutions \u201calso face reputational damage if they are seen to be contributing to climate change or failing to manage climate risks\u201d.

Friday\u2019s analysis builds on a warning by the Reserve Bank deputy governor, Guy Debelle, who said in March climate change posed risks to Australia\u2019s financial stability. Debelle said policymakers needed to consider warming as a trend and not a cyclical event. He said policymakers and businesses needed to \u201cthink in terms of trend rather than cycles in the weather\u201d. \u201cDroughts have generally been regarded, at least economically, as cyclical events that recur every so often. In contrast, climate change is a trend change. The impact of a trend is ongoing, whereas a cycle is temporary.\u201d The deputy governor said there was a need to reassess the frequency of climate change events, and \u201cour assumptions about the severity and longevity of the climatic events\u201d. In March, Apra flagged an intention to increase scrutiny of how banks, insurers and superannuation trustees are managing the financial risks of climate change to their businesses. Last year Asic said climate change was \u201ca foreseeable risk facing many listed companies in the Australian market in a range of different industries\u201d and warned directors and management of listed companies \u201cto understand and continually reassess existing and emerging risks including climate risk that may affect the company\u2019s business\u201d. In that same assessment by the corporate watchdog, 17% of listed companies in the Asic sample identified climate risk as a material risk in their operating and financial reviews. The RBA noted on Friday, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), it will take significant effort to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, as targeted in the Paris agreement. \u201cEven if targets are met, this level of warming is likely to be accompanied by rising sea levels and an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather including storms, heatwaves and droughts,\u201d it said. \u201cSome of these outcomes are already apparent.

      "body": "<p>Six million home and motor policyholders are being overcharged around \u00a3200 a head every year by insurance firms, according to a damning assessment of the industry by the Financial Conduct Authority.</p> <p>The City regulator found that elderly and low-income people were among the worst hit groups overpaying a combined \u00a31.2bn in annual premiums because insurance firms are not giving good deals to loyal customers.</p> <p>Its investigation found widespread evidence of a \u201cloyalty penalty\u201d, and it accused insurers of specifically targeting loyal customers with big premium hikes in the knowledge they were less likely to switch. It also found a \u201crange of practices to raise barriers to switching\u201d, such as automatic policy renewals for customers.</p> <p>\u201cThis market is not working well for all consumers,\u201d said Christopher Woolard, the executive director of strategy and competition at the FCA. \u201cWhile a large number of people shop around, many loyal customers are not getting a good deal. We believe this affects about 6m customers.\u201d</p> <p>The report suggests that insurers make bigger profit margins on low-income customers, who are less likely to shop around online. It found that consumers with earnings below \u00a330,000 a year who buy combined building and contents cover pay higher margins than those on higher incomes.</p> <p>A home insurance renewal letter sent to a profoundly deaf couple aged 91 and 92 last month by one of the major insurers, seen by the Guardian, demanded a 20% increase to \u00a3579 for a small semi in the Midlands. When the couple\u2019s son went to the same insurer\u2019s online site and posed as a new customer, the premium was just \u00a3108.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jan/16/home-insurance-swindle-loyal-customers-premium-rises\">Investigations by Guardian Money </a>in 2016 uncovered a 97-year-old charged \u00a31,000 by Lloyds Bank for insurance on a small bungalow compared with the \u00a3247 that the bank wanted for the same cover online. Another woman in her 70s found that Saga was charging her four times the rate available on a comparison site.</p> <p>The FCA told insurers two years ago to prominently publish the previous year\u2019s premium when sending out renewal letters, but while the move had saved around \u00a3185m so far for customers, it said more needs to be done.</p> <p>The interim report suggests banning or restricting practices such as raising prices for consumers who renew year-on-year, or requiring firms to automatically move consumers to cheaper equivalent deals.</p> <p>It also raised the prospect of compelling insurers to publish information about price differentials between customers.</p> <p>Consumer groups said insurers have been engaged in \u201csharp pricing practices\u201d for some time. Gareth Shaw of Which?, said: \u201cOur research has found existing insurance customers can be left paying hundreds of pounds more than new customers as a result of complex and opaque pricing systems.</p> <p>\u201cThe regulator must now ensure these proposals are brought in swiftly, and that it is ready to take strong action against firms that continue to rip off consumers simply for staying with their providers.\u201d</p> <p>But Huw Evans, the director general of the Association of British Insurers, representing the industry, said: \u201cMillions of insurance customers get extremely good deals by shopping around regularly, but we agree that the household and motor insurance markets could work better for consumers who do not shop around at renewal.\u201d</p> <p>The FCA said it would publish its final report, including its consultation on which remedies to introduce, in the first quarter next year.</p> <p>Customers who stay loyal to their mobile, broadband or insurance providers are paying as much as \u00a31,000 a year more than serial switchers \u2013 costing them a total \u00a34.1bn more \u2013 according to research from the charity <a href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/about-us/how-citizens-advice-works/media/press-releases/citizens-advice-responds-to-the-governments-announcement-on-the-loyalty-penalty1/\">Citizens Advice</a>, which filed a \u201csupercomplaint\u201d last year, prompting the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to investigate. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s great to see the FCA acknowledging that the insurance market isn\u2019t working for consumers and pledging to crack down on the loyalty penalty,\u201d said Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice. </p> <p>In June, the government launched a consultation looking at whether to give the CMA <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/jun/18/uk-overcharging-loyal-customers-fines-mobile-phone-broadband-insurance\">new powers to impose direct fines</a> where consumer law has been broken.

      "bodyText": "Six million home and motor policyholders are being overcharged around \u00a3200 a head every year by insurance firms, according to a damning assessment of the industry by the Financial Conduct Authority. The City regulator found that elderly and low-income people were among the worst hit groups overpaying a combined \u00a31.2bn in annual premiums because insurance firms are not giving good deals to loyal customers. Its investigation found widespread evidence of a \u201cloyalty penalty\u201d, and it accused insurers of specifically targeting loyal customers with big premium hikes in the knowledge they were less likely to switch. It also found a \u201crange of practices to raise barriers to switching\u201d, such as automatic policy renewals for customers. \u201cThis market is not working well for all consumers,\u201d said Christopher Woolard, the executive director of strategy and competition at the FCA. \u201cWhile a large number of people shop around, many loyal customers are not getting a good deal. We believe this affects about 6m customers.\u201d The report suggests that insurers make bigger profit margins on low-income customers, who are less likely to shop around online. It found that consumers with earnings below \u00a330,000 a year who buy combined building and contents cover pay higher margins than those on higher incomes. A home insurance renewal letter sent to a profoundly deaf couple aged 91 and 92 last month by one of the major insurers, seen by the Guardian, demanded a 20% increase to \u00a3579 for a small semi in the Midlands. When the couple\u2019s son went to the same insurer\u2019s online site and posed as a new customer, the premium was just \u00a3108. Investigations by Guardian Money in 2016 uncovered a 97-year-old charged \u00a31,000 by Lloyds Bank for insurance on a small bungalow compared with the \u00a3247 that the bank wanted for the same cover online. Another woman in her 70s found that Saga was charging her four times the rate available on a comparison site. The FCA told insurers two years ago to prominently publish the previous year\u2019s premium when sending out renewal letters, but while the move had saved around \u00a3185m so far for customers, it said more needs to be done. The interim report suggests banning or restricting practices such as raising prices for consumers who renew year-on-year, or requiring firms to automatically move consumers to cheaper equivalent deals. It also raised the prospect of compelling insurers to publish information about price differentials between customers. Consumer groups said insurers have been engaged in \u201csharp pricing practices\u201d for some time. Gareth Shaw of Which?, said: \u201cOur research has found existing insurance customers can be left paying hundreds of pounds more than new customers as a result of complex and opaque pricing systems. \u201cThe regulator must now ensure these proposals are brought in swiftly, and that it is ready to take strong action against firms that continue to rip off consumers simply for staying with their providers.\u201d But Huw Evans, the director general of the Association of British Insurers, representing the industry, said: \u201cMillions of insurance customers get extremely good deals by shopping around regularly, but we agree that the household and motor insurance markets could work better for consumers who do not shop around at renewal.\u201d The FCA said it would publish its final report, including its consultation on which remedies to introduce, in the first quarter next year. Customers who stay loyal to their mobile, broadband or insurance providers are paying as much as \u00a31,000 a year more than serial switchers \u2013 costing them a total \u00a34.1bn more \u2013 according to research from the charity Citizens Advice, which filed a \u201csupercomplaint\u201d last year, prompting the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to investigate. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see the FCA acknowledging that the insurance market isn\u2019t working for consumers and pledging to crack down on the loyalty penalty,\u201d said Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice. In June, the government launched a consultation looking at whether to give the CMA new powers to impose direct fines where consumer law has been broken. This means the competition watchdog would not have to go through the courts and could intervene earlier and move more quickly. Ministers believe this will act as a powerful deterrent to firms that are harming consumers with misleading claims, unfair terms and conditions and hard-to-exit contracts.",

They are travelling by train to meet their half-brother, who had an African father and who is returning from overseas a successful man. As a whole, Anthem is tough \u2013 these three may be disadvantaged, but they are angry, intimidating and racist. \u201cThis is black country, bitch, our land, our country,\u201d says the young Aboriginal woman. \u201cThis is my country too,\u201d says a middle-aged white woman.

In one of the strongest \u2013 Reeves\u2019 7-Eleven and Chemist Warehouse, A Love Story \u2013 a young Indian man flourishes a gun to demand his backpay from the 7-Eleven that employed him. His girlfriend is enamoured by the romantic idea of Bonnie and Clyde, and the two take off on a crime spree, feeling in their bones that capitalism is to blame, but not quite sure how and why. Tsiolkas\u2019s tale, Brothers and Sisters, is of three loud and obnoxious half-siblings \u2013 it\u2019s not quite clear until the end, but they have different fathers, an Aboriginal, an Arab and an Anglo. They are travelling by train to meet their half-brother, who had an African father and who is returning from overseas a successful man. As a whole, Anthem is tough \u2013 these three may be disadvantaged, but they are angry, intimidating and racist. \u201cThis is black country, bitch, our land, our country,\u201d says the young Aboriginal woman. \u201cThis is my country too,\u201d says a middle-aged white woman. A Greek man, who has worked in factories all his life, yells back: \u201cThis is our country. We made this fucking country.\u201d A middle-aged prim woman is sadder and more desperate than she appears, a victim of economics and gender. The relationship between a pair of young lovers, frolicking around the station, hides something. One of the most gripping scenes is of a young, poor mother who loses it when faced with a ticket inspector who issues a fine she cannot afford. Her racist rant is filmed, and we know she will be self-righteously shamed. The 14 cast members are excellent, with special mention to Eryn Jean Norvill, who shows outstanding comic timing and physicality; and Carly Sheppard, who plays an Indigenous woman whose front just masks her vulnerability. Ruci Kaisila\u2019s rendition of I Still Call Australia Home, as she rattles her charity tin demanding the commuters \u201cpay up\u201d, is gloriously ironic. Music by composer Irine Vela, who also composed the score of Who\u2019s Afraid, is central and seamless. There are few false notes, although on occasions it veered towards working-class clich\u00e9. A rendition of the Richmond Football Club\u2019s song, Tigerland \u2013 as though this is some form of modern-day anthem \u2013 seems shallow. The successful brother gaining the world but losing his working-class soul is too easy. But these are quibbles. This is tough, funny theatre with an urgency to its purpose and no comfortable answers. It can\u2019t say everything about modern Australia, but what it does say rings true. \u2022 Anthem runs until 6 October at the Arts Centre Melbourne, with a Sydney season TBA",

Hughes also told the inquiry on Friday the term robodebt was \u201ca bit of a misnomer, particularly under the current system\u201d. \u201cAnd I think using that term is probably creating a bit more anxiety than is required,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cIf we\u2019re trying to reduce the anxiety around this, probably not using that term particularly in these sorts of settings would be helpful.\u201d Despite noting improvements to the program, including increased involvement from Centrelink staff and outreach to affected welfare recipients, the WA legal centres said on Friday that the scheme was still having an adverse impact on vulnerable people. They called for debts raised under past iterations of the scheme to be reviewed, arguing people who had overpayments raised under the old system, which involved very little oversight from staff, would have paid back money they did not owe. And they said they were dealing with a backlog of welfare recipients who had received debt letters under past versions of the scheme. \u201cI think it\u2019s passing strange that such a massive scheme can be introduced and now we\u2019re trying to fix it as we go along,\u201d said Jackie Wallis of Peel Community Legal Services. Critics of the scheme have long said that it causes stress and anxiety among the country\u2019s most vulnerable people. Research has shown welfare recipients are more likely to report mental health issues and in the submissions to the inquiry, Australia\u2019s peak body for mental health organisations says the debt recovery scheme has \u201cexacerbated\u201d the existing hardship and symptoms of mental illness of affected people. \u201cThe extreme and unnecessary stress caused by the manner in which the Centrelink compliance program has been undertaken is deeply concerning and well documented through previous inquiries and reviews,\u201d Mental Health Australia said. In a bid to curb growing outrage at the data-matching scheme, the Department of Human Services introduced more human involvement in 2016 when thousands of debt letters were being automatically sent to welfare recipients each week. Hughes referred to these changes and argued that the scheme\u2019s latest iteration, known as Check and Update Past Income, issues registered letters and \u201cread receipted\u201d emails asking people to update their past income using payslips and bank statements. \u201cIt\u2019s incorrect to suggest that this debt is somehow generated without human intervention, without there being some sort of discussion with an actual person,\u201d Hughes said. Although staff are involved in the process, the Department of Human Services says that staff conducting data-matching use a \u201cdebt predictor\u201d to determine whether a person should face an income compliance review. When the computer finds a discrepancy of up to $1,000 between a person\u2019s income reported to Centrelink and data held by the tax office, staff will send a letter asking them to provide payslips and bank statements to prove their past earnings. Critics say the process reverses the onus of proof onto welfare recipients, and that those who do not engage with the process or are unable to provide such evidence are likely to get a debt notice because compliance staff will then use a \u201ccontroversial averaging\u201d tool to predict their fortnightly income using their annual tax return.

      "bodyText": "Police in the northern New South Wales town of Casino have denied they planned to deploy specially trained officers to shoot and kill magpies, contrary to media reports. On Friday the Northern Star reported that elite police officers would descend on the town to shoot local magpies which have been deemed too dangerous to live. According to quotes attributed to acting sergeant David Henderson, police \u201cspecially trained to euthanise animals as painlessly and quickly as possible\u201d were to be brought in. But NSW Police issued a statement in the afternoon saying \u201cthere is no proposed magpie cull in Casino or anywhere in the Richmond police district\u201d. Local councillor Jill Lyons confirmed there were no plans, and said she was glad it had not come to such measures. \u201cNo one is aware of extra police coming into the area,\u201d she said. \u201cNo police have been called in to shoot anything in the Richmond valley this season. \u201cAs a resident of Richmond valley I can say I am totally against any method of police coming in and shooting a magpie. I\u2019ve been swooped myself and there is no way a magpie deserves to die just because it is doing the very job it is designed to do, which is safeguard its young. \u201cWe\u2019re causing so much harm to the environment as it is,\u201d Lyons said. \u201cWhy do we think we have the right to do this?\u201d Three instances of magpie swooping have been recorded in Casino in the past months by the Magpie Alert site. On 2 August a magpie was reported to have swooped children at a park near Light street; on 22 August a user reported a \u201creally aggressive bird\u201d while walking on Barker Street; and on 5 September a jogger on Centre Street recorded that they had watched a magpie attack a cycling postie, saying \u201cwatched it swoop the postman lmao\u201d. In September 2018, according to the Northern Star, plainclothes officers shot and killed a magpie that attacked an elderly woman at a shopping centre in nearby Lismore. The 70-year old woman injured her knee and was treated by paramedics after the magpie swooped. An hour later, two officers dressed in shorts and T-shirts arrived at the centre and shot the magpie, the paper reported. A witness told the newspaper she was \u201cunable to sleep that night\u201d because she was so shocked by the incident and kept \u201creplaying it in her mind\u201d. Last month the Hills Shire council in Sydney authorised the shooting of a \u201cparticularly aggressive magpie\u201d that had allegedly swooped and injured people for years. Lyons said the council had extensive non-lethal methods to keep the community safe from magpie attacks. \u201cCouncil puts a lot of signs up where there are magpies acting more aggressively to the community,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it has been worse than any other season. I haven\u2019t been swooped yet, so for me it\u2019s a good season.\u201d The magpie was voted bird of the year in the 2017 Guardian/Birdlife Australia poll. Voting in the 2019 poll begins on 28 October.",

      "body": "<p><em>Grand Union</em> is Zadie Smith\u2019s first collection of short stories, combining 11 new pieces with previously published work. As she said in an <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">interview with CBC Radio</a>, she is not attracted by neat shapes: \u201cSomething about perfect form repels me. My novels are like that too \u2013 I know they should be slim and controlled, but instead they\u2019re this ragbag.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRagbags\u201d her five novels are not, but they are led by character and story, not by image. Even a novel as unified as<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/sep/10/fiction.zadiesmith\" title=\"\"> <em>On Beauty</em></a> doesn\u2019t seek to pull together voice and perception in a metaphor the way a Chekhov tale might: it\u2019s too interested in ranging across time and in the comedy of varied perspectives; in getting on, as a novel ought, with the plot.</p> <p>In the opening story of this volume, though, Smith duly pours her naturally various energies into a narrow Chekhovian frame. \u201cThe Dialectic\u201d is set, like \u201cLady with Lapdog\u201d, in a European seaside resort. It takes us inside the busy, anxious mind of a single mother trying to enjoy her holiday, and it turns on images of chicken: barbecued and gobbled, bones buried in the sand, and finally, uniting her meditation on migrations and gender, chicks being sexed in a factory where all the males are \u201cswept into huge grinding vats where they are minced alive\u201d.</p> <p>The next piece, \u201cSentimental Education\u201d, also essays a classic short story shape, the sort where the voice of an older narrator, in this case another stressed mother, and the deeds of her younger self, a driven Cambridge student, twist together and gleam like the surfaces of a M\u00f6bius strip. The characters are involving, the observation bracing, and the action sexy and hilarious, so we do not mind that this story overflows its form, and the older narrator becomes a token presence at the very end \u2013 though we may long to read the novel to which all this seems to belong.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is no moment in Grand\u00a0Union when we are not entertained, or doubt that we are in the company of\u00a0one of our best\u00a0writers</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>After this, forms proliferate. There is autofiction, speculative fiction (including an enterprising riff on the urban myth that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/michaeljackson\" title=\"\">Michael Jackson</a> took <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2012/may/11/elizabeth-taylor-novelist-english\" title=\"\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/marlonbrando\" title=\"\">Marlon Brando</a> out of town to escape 9/11), and some mixtures of speculative fiction and parable. There is one full-blown and terrifying Brechtian parable in \u201cTwo Men Arrive in a Village\u201d, and an abundance of metafictions scratching away at the elements of narrative, some of which, such as the irritable and meandering \u201cParents\u2019 Morning Epiphany\u201d, feel a little underpowered.</p> <p>The story \u201cBlocked\u201d, though, challenges us to cavil against this restless experimentation. Here, we are in the company of a writer who has been successful early on and somehow lost her confidence. She puts her energy into \u201cparallel projects\u201d, keeps working, gets a dog, looks for the energy of the incomplete. \u201cThese days I love a fragment. I don\u2019t think of a fragment as flawed or partial in any way. It\u2019s the completist model that got me into such trouble in the first place. Now I praise the half-done, the unfinished, the broken, the shard! Who am I to turn my back on the fragment? Who am I to say the fragment is insufficient?\u201d</p> <p>And who, of course, are we? There is no moment in <em>Grand Union</em> when we are not entertained, or doubt that we are in the company of one of our best contemporary writers. The only real regrets come when Smith herself seems to doubt \u2013 or perhaps is overwhelmed by the many claims made on her identity. We would have followed the vivid children of \u201cJust Right\u201d into a novel: the story feels abandoned rather than sculpted. The acute critique of the anxiety in our universities around free speech and social media shaming in the story \u201cNow More Than Ever\u201d does not need its elaborate speculative fictional frame in which professors point enormous arrows at each other. The ambiguous, semi-fictional stance of the shadowy narrator in the autofictions \u201cLazy River\u201d and \u201cDowntown\u201d, who seems to be everything that Smith is except a writer, diminishes their penetrating, witty, desolating observations, because it deprives them, quite literally, of authority.</p> <p>Similarly, we are quite aware as we are reading \u201cKelso Deconstructed\u201d, which is the reconstruction of the last days of Kelso Cochrane, murdered by racists in Notting Hill in 1959, that we are being told an imaginative story about a factual event by an artful writer: the relaxed beauty of the scene-setting and casual perfection of the dialogue tells us so. The moments when Smith leans in authorially to tell us something, that the witness accounts of the killing of Kelso can be arranged as a chilling poem, for example, have equal grace. The irruptions of metafiction, by contrast \u2013 when Kelso\u2019s girlfriend is found embroidering a writing mantra instead of a proverb, or the tube stops read \u201cTolstoy, Morrison\u201d, or a Dr Rooney gives Kelso a prescription that reads \u201cFrom YoungIrishWriter@gmail.com to OlderEnglishWriter@yahoo.com\u201d \u2013 are baffling. Why does Zadie Smith need <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/sally-rooney\" title=\"\">Sally Rooney</a> in her story? Does she really agree with Dr Rooney\u2019s \u201cprescription\u201d that there is something \u201cslightly dishonest\u201d in telling a story as \u201ca kind of parable or illustration of a precept\u201d? If so, why, when there is such an important tale as Cochrane\u2019s to tell, and a writer such as Smith to tell it?</p> <p>It\u2019s frustrating because an unconstrained Smith in full flight across the page is such a magnificent sight, whether it is in a fairly conventional story such as \u201cMiss Adele Amidst the Corsets\u201d, when she sends an ageing drag queen running across New York, or in a surrealist fantasy such as the title story where a daughter goes to sit with her mother who \u201cfor being dead, looked pretty fantastic\u201d. Best of all, and pointing surely to Smith\u2019s future, is \u201cFor the King\u201d, a piece in the autobiographical manner of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/karl-ove-knausgard\" title=\"\">Karl Ove Knausgaard</a>, where an \u201cI\u201d who is a writer goes out to meet a friend in Paris. Here the autofictional convention works to liberate Smith into fully inhabiting her alarmingly clever, deeply unconventional, multiplicitous self. This narrator does not pause to worry at her own story: instead, she talks all night; as happy discussing her \u201ccrisp\u201d denim jacket as she is talking about women and time, and drawing together the many arguments about communication and shame that haunt this collection into a few deft anecdotes.</p> <p>This piece, too, overflows its boundaries: after the dinner, the narrator realises there is one tale she has not told. But this time the overflow is artful, meant: the last story, told to us apparently involuntarily, is about a man with Tourette\u2019s on a train. His cry of \u201cPour le roi\u201d, heard through the \u201cbrown noise\u201d of noise-cancelling earphones, and his wife\u2019s automatic replies, remain \u201ca human utterance, which still carries some form of meaning, however small\u201d. This statement of faith in words and communication is a relief in a book so riven with doubt, and it is heartening that it comes in a story that seems to have found its own, and so its perfect, form.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Kate Clanchy\u2019s Some Kids I Taught and What They Taught Me is published by Picador.

We spend 10% for much better outcomes. Why on earth would we want to move towards that?\u201d",

Greenery <em>has</em> proved scary before, in everything from The Day of the Triffids to Signs to the grisly extremes of The Ruins, but here, it\u2019s more of an annoyance and plays second fiddle to the nightmarish terror of \u2026 a big rock.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/25/in-the-shadow-of-the-moon-review-goofy-but-ambitious-netflix-thriller\">In the Shadow of the Moon review \u2013 goofy but ambitious Netflix thriller</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Which brings us to a far less debate-worthy question, also raised in the film: \u201cCan rocks be scary?\u201d The answer reveals itself immediately after said rock appears (spoiler: it\u2019s no). But don\u2019t tell that to Cube director Vincenzo Natali, who has long been fixated on bringing the short story, co-authored by Stephen King and son Joe Hill, to the screen. His film treats a Kansas field as if it were a haunted house, an ambitious gambit that in practice is easier to politely admire than it is to enthusiastically celebrate.</p> <p>The set-up, which loosely recalls Jeepers Creepers, sees a brother and sister on a sweltering car journey who find themselves drawn into an attempted rescue in the middle of nowhere. While in Jeepers Creepers the siblings ventured into a pit of corpses only to become targeted by an evil organ-consuming monster, this time they\u2019re dragged into a field, concerned by the cries of a child lost in the tall grass before finding themselves stuck in a never-ending maze of blades. Once they\u2019re in, it\u2019s seemingly impossible to get out, and their bad day switches to worse when they realise they\u2019re stuck in there with \u2026 a big rock.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7afc9gTbVFI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7afc9gTbVFI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Natali does manage some successfully squirmy tension in the first act, immersing us in the pair\u2019s increasingly frustrating Blair Witch-style panic as they struggle to make logical sense of an illogical scenario. He finds ways of visualising their predicament that avoid repetition, the camera swirling in and around the grass, teasing at a freedom the characters aren\u2019t allowed. But as the situation worsens, our interest weakens. The convoluted plot that\u2019s slowly revealed transforms an eerie campfire tale into an overstuffed head-scratcher with clunky dialogue like \u201cYou can\u2019t run from redemption!\u201d as an expanding set of characters grapple with the mounting silliness around them.</p> <p>The cast is populated by unknowns, save for a scenery-chewing Patrick Wilson as a father looking for his son, and the characters are equally anonymous, Natali\u2019s script never truly investing us in the brother-sister dynamic. While some of the nastier lurches in the third act will appease genre fans, the guff that surrounds them will probably confuse and ultimately alienate them, the film\u2019s moving parts never really moving in unison. \u201cThis is never gonna stop!\u201d a character shouts near the end but mercifully it eventually does, settling in for a life down among the weeds next to Netflix\u2019s many other equally forgettable horror misfires.</p> <ul> <li><p>In the Tall Grass is now available on Netflix</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "\u201cCan grass be scary?\u201d is a key question propelling the gory Netflix chiller In the Tall Grass, an adaptation of a creepy novella uncomfortably stretched to a not-quite-as-creepy full-length feature. Greenery has proved scary before, in everything from The Day of the Triffids to Signs to the grisly extremes of The Ruins, but here, it\u2019s more of an annoyance and plays second fiddle to the nightmarish terror of \u2026 a big rock. Which brings us to a far less debate-worthy question, also raised in the film: \u201cCan rocks be scary?\u201d The answer reveals itself immediately after said rock appears (spoiler: it\u2019s no). But don\u2019t tell that to Cube director Vincenzo Natali, who has long been fixated on bringing the short story, co-authored by Stephen King and son Joe Hill, to the screen. His film treats a Kansas field as if it were a haunted house, an ambitious gambit that in practice is easier to politely admire than it is to enthusiastically celebrate. The set-up, which loosely recalls Jeepers Creepers, sees a brother and sister on a sweltering car journey who find themselves drawn into an attempted rescue in the middle of nowhere. While in Jeepers Creepers the siblings ventured into a pit of corpses only to become targeted by an evil organ-consuming monster, this time they\u2019re dragged into a field, concerned by the cries of a child lost in the tall grass before finding themselves stuck in a never-ending maze of blades. Once they\u2019re in, it\u2019s seemingly impossible to get out, and their bad day switches to worse when they realise they\u2019re stuck in there with \u2026 a big rock. Natali does manage some successfully squirmy tension in the first act, immersing us in the pair\u2019s increasingly frustrating Blair Witch-style panic as they struggle to make logical sense of an illogical scenario. He finds ways of visualising their predicament that avoid repetition, the camera swirling in and around the grass, teasing at a freedom the characters aren\u2019t allowed. But as the situation worsens, our interest weakens. The convoluted plot that\u2019s slowly revealed transforms an eerie campfire tale into an overstuffed head-scratcher with clunky dialogue like \u201cYou can\u2019t run from redemption!\u201d as an expanding set of characters grapple with the mounting silliness around them. The cast is populated by unknowns, save for a scenery-chewing Patrick Wilson as a father looking for his son, and the characters are equally anonymous, Natali\u2019s script never truly investing us in the brother-sister dynamic. While some of the nastier lurches in the third act will appease genre fans, the guff that surrounds them will probably confuse and ultimately alienate them, the film\u2019s moving parts never really moving in unison. \u201cThis is never gonna stop!\u201d a character shouts near the end but mercifully it eventually does, settling in for a life down among the weeds next to Netflix\u2019s many other equally forgettable horror misfires. In the Tall Grass is now available on Netflix",

Last year 72% of over-5s were vaccinated, a figure they hope will reach 75% this year, said Prof Yvonne Doyle, the medical director at Public Health England. \u201cEvery winter there is always the threat of a bad flu season. Flu is a serious illness and can even be deadly for the most vulnerable of our population,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The uptake among those under 65 but vulnerable because of chronic conditions was 48%, she said, which they hoped to see rise to 55%. Among pregnant women, it was 45%; among healthcare workers, it was 70%. \u201cThat has improved remarkably,\u201d she added.</p> <p>There is a big variation in the rates of healthcare workers being immunised from one NHS trust to another. Some trusts do well, with 90% vaccinated, while others only manage 40% to 50%. Sally Davies, then the chief medical officer for England, told a parliamentary committee in June that all healthcare workers who refused the jab should wear a lapel badge to warn their patients they were not protected.</p> <p>\u201cThe NHS is setting in place a buddy system so the good trusts can teach and partner with ones that don\u2019t have good figures to bring them up as fast as possible,\u201d said Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England.</p> <p>He said there was an element of professional responsibility about the decision for healthcare staff to be vaccinated. \u201cWe do know that flu infections can also be asymptomatic and staff can spread flu without realising it. A patient doesn\u2019t want to think seven out of 10 healthcare workers you will meet will be vaccinated. You want nine out of 10 to be vaccinated,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Unison, representing healthcare workers, said staff responded best to encouragement. \u201cNo NHS worker would ever willingly put patients or colleagues at risk. But the highest vaccination rates are in trusts that encourage staff to get the jab, not those where employees are coerced,\u201d said the union\u2019s head of health, Sara Gorton.</p> <p>\u201cPressuring staff to have the injection, when some may be reluctant for genuine reasons, is counterproductive. The NHS couldn\u2019t get by without the goodwill of its staff and trusts shouldn\u2019t jeopardise that.\u201d</p> <p>Van-Tam said there would be no shortage of vaccines, even if the UK crashes out of Europe without a deal. \u201cThere is no possibility that we won\u2019t have enough vaccines,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has been very carefully thought through.\u201d</p> <p>Most of the vaccines needed will arrive in the UK before 31 October, he said. The only exception would be supplies for those under 65 at risk because of chronic conditions. The vaccine manufacturer Sanofi Pasteur would deliver two-thirds of what is needed before the Brexit date, but the final third in November.</p> <p>The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has ordered an additional 400,000 doses of the quadrivalent vaccine (against four strains of flu) for this group, which would arrive before the end of the month. \u201cWe do recognise that it is an extraordinary year,\u201d said Van-Tam.</p>",

Children are considered \u201csuper-spreaders\u201d, liable to infect others in their family and a danger to the elderly. All children aged two to 11 will be offered the nasal spray vaccine in the coming weeks. Public Health England, NHS England and the Department of Health and Social Care said last year\u2019s flu season was not the most severe, but it still had an impact on hospital and intensive care unit admissions and there were nearly 1,700 deaths. Those at highest risk are the elderly and those with health problems. Last year 72% of over-5s were vaccinated, a figure they hope will reach 75% this year, said Prof Yvonne Doyle, the medical director at Public Health England. \u201cEvery winter there is always the threat of a bad flu season. Flu is a serious illness and can even be deadly for the most vulnerable of our population,\u201d she said. The uptake among those under 65 but vulnerable because of chronic conditions was 48%, she said, which they hoped to see rise to 55%. Among pregnant women, it was 45%; among healthcare workers, it was 70%. \u201cThat has improved remarkably,\u201d she added. There is a big variation in the rates of healthcare workers being immunised from one NHS trust to another. Some trusts do well, with 90% vaccinated, while others only manage 40% to 50%. Sally Davies, then the chief medical officer for England, told a parliamentary committee in June that all healthcare workers who refused the jab should wear a lapel badge to warn their patients they were not protected. \u201cThe NHS is setting in place a buddy system so the good trusts can teach and partner with ones that don\u2019t have good figures to bring them up as fast as possible,\u201d said Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England. He said there was an element of professional responsibility about the decision for healthcare staff to be vaccinated. \u201cWe do know that flu infections can also be asymptomatic and staff can spread flu without realising it. A patient doesn\u2019t want to think seven out of 10 healthcare workers you will meet will be vaccinated. You want nine out of 10 to be vaccinated,\u201d he said. Unison, representing healthcare workers, said staff responded best to encouragement. \u201cNo NHS worker would ever willingly put patients or colleagues at risk. But the highest vaccination rates are in trusts that encourage staff to get the jab, not those where employees are coerced,\u201d said the union\u2019s head of health, Sara Gorton. \u201cPressuring staff to have the injection, when some may be reluctant for genuine reasons, is counterproductive. The NHS couldn\u2019t get by without the goodwill of its staff and trusts shouldn\u2019t jeopardise that.\u201d Van-Tam said there would be no shortage of vaccines, even if the UK crashes out of Europe without a deal. \u201cThere is no possibility that we won\u2019t have enough vaccines,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has been very carefully thought through.\u201d Most of the vaccines needed will arrive in the UK before 31 October, he said. The only exception would be supplies for those under 65 at risk because of chronic conditions. The vaccine manufacturer Sanofi Pasteur would deliver two-thirds of what is needed before the Brexit date, but the final third in November. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has ordered an additional 400,000 doses of the quadrivalent vaccine (against four strains of flu) for this group, which would arrive before the end of the month. \u201cWe do recognise that it is an extraordinary year,\u201d said Van-Tam.",

The argument has been raging ever since he got elected. In January, Twitter addressed controversy about Trump\u2019s tweeting \u2013 without explicitly naming the president \u2013 in a blogpost titled <a href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2018/world-leaders-and-twitter.html\">World Leaders on Twitter</a>.</p> <p>\u201cBlocking a world leader from Twitter or removing their controversial Tweets would hide important information people should be able to see and debate,\u201d the blogpost explained. \u201cIt would also not silence that leader, but it would certainly hamper necessary discussion around their words and actions.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Is banning Trump an assault on free speech?</strong></h2> <p>There\u2019s been a lot of outrage about the sanctity of the first amendment following Harris\u2019s call to ban Trump from Twitter. The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DailyCaller/status/1179431764407836677?s=20\">Democratic presidential hopeful Tulsi Gabbard, for example, said</a>: \u201cWe can\u2019t just cancel or shut down or silence those who we disagree with or who hold different views or who say things even that we strongly disagree with. These freedoms and principles enshrined in our constitution are things we have to take very seriously.\u201d</p> <p>In response, Harris\u2019s national press secretary, Ian Sams, accused Gabbard of echoing Fox News. \u201cThis was the exact talking point Fox News personalities were promulgating on air all day yesterday,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IanSams/status/1179370772646768640?s=20\">Sams tweeted on Wednesday</a>.</p> <p>This may not have been the most helpfully worded response by Sams, who sounds like he is arguing that free speech is a rightwing talking point. However, it is true that banning Trump from Twitter isn\u2019t really a free speech issue. As Twitter itself noted in its January blogpost, banning a world leader wouldn\u2019t silence them. If Trump was forced off Twitter he could just go on Fox News every day. He could hold more press conferences. Hell, he could even start his own social network.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7309ce4f52b9f8be421751829bc49743d56488f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7309ce4f52b9f8be421751829bc49743d56488f6/0_195_5862_3517/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Twitter allows Trump to communicate in a direct and unfiltered way with the public, which may include spouting blatant untruths.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Twitter allows Trump to communicate in a direct and unfiltered way with the public, which may include spouting blatant untruths.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: J David Ake/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Further, it\u2019s not like Twitter allows unfettered free speech.

Banning Trump sends a message that Twitter is serious about its rules and that Trump, like everyone else must be held accountable for his actions.

Unbelievable, a fact-based feminist crime drama crafted from reporting by the US outlet ProPublica, does something truly revolutionary: it tells rape stories from womens\u2019 perspectives. Not just one woman\u2019s perspective, but many \u2013 in addition to Marie, there are two intelligent and empathetic female officers (Merritt Wever and Toni Collette) investigating similar crimes by a serial rapist, and a diverse trail of survivors dealing with a hostile criminal justice system. Unbelievable isn\u2019t about rape; it\u2019s about the procedures that follow it that re-traumatise women. While the drama\u2019s development is often deliberately, and frustratingly slow, the show has reinvented the crime genre in eight fascinating episodes.</p> <h2><strong>Inside Man</strong></h2> <p><em><strong>By Spike Lee (US, 2006) \u2013 11 October</strong></em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/08/from-the-nightingale-to-charles-manson-twice-why-damon-herriman-is-the-scariest-man-in-film\">From The Nightingale to Charles Manson (twice): why Damon Herriman is the scariest man in film</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To think that Spike Lee\u2019s immaculate crime thriller was made before the global financial crisis!

      "bodyText": "Netflix Unbelievable US, 2019 \u2013 out now A teenager, Marie (Kaitlyn Dever), is raped at gunpoint in her home. She then retracts her story and is charged with filing false information. Unbelievable, a fact-based feminist crime drama crafted from reporting by the US outlet ProPublica, does something truly revolutionary: it tells rape stories from womens\u2019 perspectives. Not just one woman\u2019s perspective, but many \u2013 in addition to Marie, there are two intelligent and empathetic female officers (Merritt Wever and Toni Collette) investigating similar crimes by a serial rapist, and a diverse trail of survivors dealing with a hostile criminal justice system. Unbelievable isn\u2019t about rape; it\u2019s about the procedures that follow it that re-traumatise women. While the drama\u2019s development is often deliberately, and frustratingly slow, the show has reinvented the crime genre in eight fascinating episodes. Inside Man By Spike Lee (US, 2006) \u2013 11 October To think that Spike Lee\u2019s immaculate crime thriller was made before the global financial crisis! Over 24 hours, a perfect Wall Street bank heist is instigated by a thief (a gravelly Clive Owen), investigated by a suave police officer (Denzel Washington) and negotiated by a shady corporate fixer (diamond-eyed Jodie Foster). The film now reads as both a prediction of disaster in the financial sector and a jolting indictment of America\u2019s wealth obsession and deep corruption. Honourable mentions: The Good Place season four (TV, out now), The Politician (TV, out now), Shrek, Jaws (films, 11 October). Stan The Master By Paul Thomas Anderson (US, 2012) \u2013 16 October Despite using L Ron Hubbard as a template for one of its central characters, Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s portrait of co-dependence, pathological bonds and cults isn\u2019t so much a depiction of Scientology\u2019s birth but a study of traumatised drifters \u2013 including lost and traumatised Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix) \u2013 in the wake of the second world war. After failing to readjust to civilian life, naval veteran Freddie drunkenly boards a moored boat and encounters Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a huckster who is founding a new religion. In the community surrounding the charismatic, fatherly Dodd, Freddie sees a place to belong in a society still in flux. Anderson pulls you slowly into the centre of the pair\u2019s turbulent relationship \u2013 yes, it\u2019s a relationship film \u2013 in this luminously beautiful vision of floating life in 1950s USA. The Hunt for Red October By John McTiernan (US, 1990) \u2013 24 October As the end of the cold war approached, a final slew of cheeseball, B-movie classics emerged from popular cinema, with typically American ideological impulses. In claustrophobic lockdown, Soviet submariner Marko Ramius (Sean Connery) abandons his orders and turns toward the US. CIA agent Jack Ryan (Alec Baldwin) wants to trust Ramius, and is tasked with discerning whether he plans to defect or launch a closer strike. The character epiphanies and plot jolts unfurl with high intensity until the very end. Honourable mentions: Friends with Money (film, out now), Anchorman (film, 4 October), The Hurt Locker (film, 5 October), The Godfather trilogy (films, 9 October), Patriot Games, Clear and Present Danger (films, 24 October). Foxtel Now The Talented Mr Ripley By Anthony Minghella (US, 1999) \u2013 1 October An impostor from society\u2019s fringes (baby-faced Matt Damon as Tom Ripley) wheedles his way into a well-heeled group of Americans (including Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow, neither of whom have been more beautiful onscreen) living in sun-drenched Italy in 1950, and finds himself pushed to ever-greater levels of criminality and self-preservation. In its winding, clever examination of class, exclusion and aspiration, Anthony Minghella\u2019s film hits the same notes of perversity as Patricia Highsmith\u2019s novel on which it was based. The result is an awfully stressful thriller, all the more unsettling for the empathy it invites us to feel for Tom \u2013 a social outcast, a repressed queer man and a pathologically dishonest killer. In the Line of Fire By Wolfgang Petersen (US, 1993) \u2013 1 October This early 90s thriller is the kind of high-octane, quality commercial film that Hollywood achieves with diminishing frequency. A maniacal killer (John Malkovich, with just the right amount of cheesiness) taunts a secret service agent (Clint Eastwood, stoic and relentless) who is haunted by his failure to save a president from death and willing to take a bullet to restore his honour. The perfectly matched duo\u2019s cat-and-mouse game \u2013 across Washington rooftops, government parking lots and patriotic memorial monuments \u2013 makes for a great action film. Can You Ever Forgive Me? By Marielle Heller (US, 2019) \u2013 24 October Two queer misanthropes \u2013 failing writer Lee Israel (Melissa McCarthy) and professional drunkard Jack Hock (Richard E Grant) \u2013 bind together in unforgiving 1990s New York City as Lee embarks on a precarious alternate career in literary forgery. Whether you read Nicole Holofcener and Jeff Whitty\u2019s script \u2013 adapted from real-life Israel\u2019s memoir \u2013 as a bitter or sweet tale of lost souls will depend on the extent to which, like Lee, you \u201clike cats more than people\u201d. Honourable Mentions: Succession season two (TV, Mondays), The Witches of Eastwick, Ghostbusters (films, 1 October), The Mule, The Last of the Mohicans (films, 24 October). SBS On Demand New Girl box set (US, 2011-18) \u2013 1 October All seven seasons of this zippily scripted hipster sitcom are here.

While the men lie in comas waiting for a cure, apparitions appear, and reality becomes indiscernible from the inner dreaming worlds of the infirm.

      "body": "<p>Workers are fed up. From teachers and hotel workers to nurses and auto workers, about three dozen labor strikes since 2018 have made the nation\u2019s headlines. Over the weekend, a youth-led climate strike spanned the globe and a <a href=\"https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2019/09/25/gm-uaw-strike-update-why-so-long-bernie-sanders/2434259001/\">walkout of General Motors workers entered its second week.</a> For the <a href=\"https://www.modernhealthcare.com/providers/85000-kaiser-permanente-workers-threaten-strike\">past several weeks</a>, thousands of medical practitioners at Kaiser Permanente have been preparing for a national strike against the healthcare company in October.</p> <p>This groundswell of labor activism has intersected with a number of progressive issues debated among Democratic party presidential candidates, including the urgency of climate change, exploitation of undocumented immigrants, Medicare for All, and concentrated wealth amassed by corporate profiteers, often at the expense of everyday workers.</p> <p>The signs indicate American workers are moving left. The question is: will the national Democratic party leadership move with them?</p> <p>Frequently, strikes and other forms of labor organizing transcend the specific demands of a company\u2019s employees \u2013 they raise questions about corporate malfeasance more broadly and make workers more attuned to the systems that enable inequality. The Fight for $15 campaign, for instance, started in 2012 with New York City fast-food workers demanding $15 an hour and union rights. The campaign now fights for \u201cunderpaid workers everywhere\u201d, according to the group\u2019s website, and has spread to more than <a href=\"https://fightfor15.org/about-us/\">300 cities on six continents</a>.</p> <p>Likewise, Amazon workers formed Amazon Employees for Climate Justice and <a href=\"https://medium.com/@amazonemployeesclimatejustice/amazon-employees-are-joining-the-global-climate-walkout-9-20-9bfa4cbb1ce3\">nearly 2,000</a> participated in the recent climate strike to protest against the company\u2019s role in climate change.

      "bodyText": "Workers are fed up. From teachers and hotel workers to nurses and auto workers, about three dozen labor strikes since 2018 have made the nation\u2019s headlines. Over the weekend, a youth-led climate strike spanned the globe and a walkout of General Motors workers entered its second week. For the past several weeks, thousands of medical practitioners at Kaiser Permanente have been preparing for a national strike against the healthcare company in October. This groundswell of labor activism has intersected with a number of progressive issues debated among Democratic party presidential candidates, including the urgency of climate change, exploitation of undocumented immigrants, Medicare for All, and concentrated wealth amassed by corporate profiteers, often at the expense of everyday workers. The signs indicate American workers are moving left. The question is: will the national Democratic party leadership move with them? Frequently, strikes and other forms of labor organizing transcend the specific demands of a company\u2019s employees \u2013 they raise questions about corporate malfeasance more broadly and make workers more attuned to the systems that enable inequality. The Fight for $15 campaign, for instance, started in 2012 with New York City fast-food workers demanding $15 an hour and union rights. The campaign now fights for \u201cunderpaid workers everywhere\u201d, according to the group\u2019s website, and has spread to more than 300 cities on six continents. Likewise, Amazon workers formed Amazon Employees for Climate Justice and nearly 2,000 participated in the recent climate strike to protest against the company\u2019s role in climate change. Workers in its Whole Foods division have pushed back against the company\u2019s contract with Palantir, a big data company that has helped Ice raid workplaces for undocumented immigrants. On Wednesday, in Detroit, Senator Bernie Sanders joined United Auto Workers members participating in the General Motors strike and addressed corporate greed beyond GM executives. Peppering his remarks were supportive shouts and applause from the audience when he mentioned justice, inadequate healthcare, the practice of corporate offshoring and the fatigue of Americans around the country who work multiple jobs. Strikers joined him in shouting \u201cenough is enough\u201d. Despite this growing progressive fervor, the Democrats\u2019 congressional leadership \u2013 including Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer \u2013 have focused almost entirely on targeting Donald Trump, reaching a zenith with Pelosi\u2019s announcement to launch an impeachment inquiry into his interactions with Ukraine. Outside of this singular focus, where is the Democrats\u2019 vision? What policies are they advocating to show that they, too, stand with the thousands of workers enduring economic stagnation and a weakened social safety net as corporate profits soar? Unfortunately, instead of championing this progressive wave, House leaders, Democratic leaders seem to be taking steps to undermine it. In September, the Los Angeles Times reported that political consultants were warned that the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee would boycott their services if they worked with progressive senatorial candidates in Colorado and Maine. The likely justification Democratic leaders will fall back on is that they are catering to the center to win competitive swing districts and thus the Senate.

In last year\u2019s midterms, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee reportedly sent internal memos telling candidates not to fight for gun reform or Medicare for All. If electability is the concern, why waffle on policies most Americans agree with? The steady support for Bernie Sanders and increasing support for Elizabeth Warren have cut into Joe Biden\u2019s lead in some polls, while the centrist candidates the DSCC is championing have done little to prove that they can actually win. The 2016 election should have been a sign that there was a growing disconnect between the priorities of the political establishment and the American public.

It\u2019s not in the national interest. I would say, for heaven\u2019s sake, man, go.\u201d</p> <p>Stranger still, many Labour parliamentarians agreed with them: Cameron\u2019s speech took place in the middle of a full-blown, if woefully inept, coup.</p> <p>When the 2017 exit polls on election night suggested that Labour had far exceeded expectations, increasing its vote share and seats while the Tories lost their majority, a BBC documentary showed the <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jeremy-corbyn-general-election-labour-mps-reaction-results-video-theresa-may-prime-minister-a8065796.html\" title=\"\">muted response</a> of several Labour MPs. They were shocked not into jubilation, but silence; they had looked forward to his defeat, removal and \u201cparty renewal\u201d even if it meant they had to go down with him. The former leader Tony Blair, meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2017/12/tim-shipman-s-fall-out-reveals-nastiness-behind-scenes-tory-tragedy\" title=\"\">put his head in his hands</a> and said he didn\u2019t understand this country any more.</p> <p>The political and <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/journalists-brazen-dismissal-of-corbyn-was-professional-malpractice\" title=\"\">media establishments</a> are still struggling with the choice the Labour party <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/13/jeremy-corbyn-victory-energises-the-alienated-labour\" title=\"\">made in 2015</a>. The fact that the decision was emphatic, had to be made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/13/corbyn-critics-destroying-labour-party-members\" title=\"\">twice</a> following the failed coup, and was effectively <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/16/a-shock-to-the-system-how-jeremy-corbyn-changed-the-rules-of-british-politics\" title=\"\">endorsed</a> by the electorate in 2017, has not been enough. On some level, that goes beyond the political to the psychological: they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/17/jeremy-corbyn-should-be-tougher-not-my-style\" title=\"\">refuse to accept</a> his tenure as legitimate.</p> <p>This sense of denial runs deep \u2013 as though insisting he should not be the party leader in effect means he\u2019s not. It is a delusion that recalls the author <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/aug/12/uk.books\" title=\"\">Doris Lessing\u2019s observation</a> of Blair\u2019s declarative approach to politics: \u201cHe believes in magic. That if you say a thing it is true.\u201d</p> <p>Corbyn is the leader of the Labour party. He has a mandate. He represents something other than just himself. That is not a statement of opinion but of fact. One does not have to like it to accept it. But the failure to accept it will have material and strategic consequences. And, with a general election imminent and the future of the country\u2019s relationship with Europe finely balanced, the moment of reckoning with that fact is long overdue. For there is no route to a second referendum without Labour; there is no means of defeating Johnson without Labour. The party remains the largest, and by far the most effective, electoral obstacle to most of the immediate crises that progressives wish to prevent. Once again that is not a case for Corbyn or for Labour, but for reality.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0fa8426e24a6ad26a6658a2c67e7506c639d3309\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0fa8426e24a6ad26a6658a2c67e7506c639d3309/0_330_5123_3072/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn is congratulated on winning the Labour leadership in 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The political and media establishments are still struggling with the choice that the Labour party made in 2015.\u2019 Jeremy Corbyn is congratulated on winning the Labour leadership in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Wermuth/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Earlier this week, when asked which was worse, a no-deal Brexit or Corbyn as prime minister, the Liberal Democrats\u2019 Scotland spokesman, Jamie Stone, <a href=\"https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/17942262.lib-dem-mp-rather-no-deal-brexit-jeremy-corbyn-pm/\" title=\"\">said</a>: \u201cIt may be that somebody else may emerge from the Labour party. I think the ball is very much in the Labour party\u2019s court to see what alternatives they could find.\u201d</p> <p>That is not going to happen. Liberal Democrats don\u2019t get to choose the Labour leader. Labour does. The Lib Dems have long struggled to understand this. In 2010 Nick Clegg said he could work with Labour, just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/apr/26/nick-clegg-hung-parliament-labour\" title=\"\">not Gordon Brown</a>. Two years later they said they could work with Labour but the shadow chancellor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/29/ed-balls-labour-lib-dems\" title=\"\">Ed Balls must go</a>.</p> <p>The insistence that Labour couldn\u2019t get the numbers in parliament to oust Johnson and make Corbyn a caretaker prime minister is a self-fulfilling prophecy made most ardently by those who won\u2019t give him the numbers. But even if it wasn\u2019t, it is a fallacy to assume that anyone else would get any closer. When pressed on which he would prefer \u2013 \u201cIs it Jeremy Corbyn or is it no deal?\u201d \u2013 Stone eventually showed his cards. \u201cIt is no deal every time.\u201d</p> <p>There is candour in this.

      "bodyText": "Departing Tory leaders have developed an odd and presumptuous habit of demanding that the leader of the opposition resign too. \u201cAs a party leader who has accepted when her time was up,\u201d Theresa May told Jeremy Corbyn in her final prime minister\u2019s questions, preparing to leave her party to Boris Johnson and the country without a prayer, \u201cperhaps the time has come for him to do the same.\u201d In 2016, David Cameron \u2013 who had called a referendum lost it, only to then break his promise and abandon the country in a moment of self-inflicted crisis \u2013 suggested Corbyn\u2019s resignation would be a patriotic act. \u201cIt might be in my party\u2019s interest for him to sit there. It\u2019s not in the national interest. I would say, for heaven\u2019s sake, man, go.\u201d Stranger still, many Labour parliamentarians agreed with them: Cameron\u2019s speech took place in the middle of a full-blown, if woefully inept, coup. When the 2017 exit polls on election night suggested that Labour had far exceeded expectations, increasing its vote share and seats while the Tories lost their majority, a BBC documentary showed the muted response of several Labour MPs. They were shocked not into jubilation, but silence; they had looked forward to his defeat, removal and \u201cparty renewal\u201d even if it meant they had to go down with him. The former leader Tony Blair, meanwhile, put his head in his hands and said he didn\u2019t understand this country any more. The political and media establishments are still struggling with the choice the Labour party made in 2015. The fact that the decision was emphatic, had to be made twice following the failed coup, and was effectively endorsed by the electorate in 2017, has not been enough. On some level, that goes beyond the political to the psychological: they refuse to accept his tenure as legitimate. This sense of denial runs deep \u2013 as though insisting he should not be the party leader in effect means he\u2019s not. It is a delusion that recalls the author Doris Lessing\u2019s observation of Blair\u2019s declarative approach to politics: \u201cHe believes in magic. That if you say a thing it is true.\u201d Corbyn is the leader of the Labour party. He has a mandate. He represents something other than just himself. That is not a statement of opinion but of fact. One does not have to like it to accept it. But the failure to accept it will have material and strategic consequences. And, with a general election imminent and the future of the country\u2019s relationship with Europe finely balanced, the moment of reckoning with that fact is long overdue. For there is no route to a second referendum without Labour; there is no means of defeating Johnson without Labour. The party remains the largest, and by far the most effective, electoral obstacle to most of the immediate crises that progressives wish to prevent. Once again that is not a case for Corbyn or for Labour, but for reality. Earlier this week, when asked which was worse, a no-deal Brexit or Corbyn as prime minister, the Liberal Democrats\u2019 Scotland spokesman, Jamie Stone, said: \u201cIt may be that somebody else may emerge from the Labour party. I think the ball is very much in the Labour party\u2019s court to see what alternatives they could find.\u201d That is not going to happen. Liberal Democrats don\u2019t get to choose the Labour leader. Labour does. The Lib Dems have long struggled to understand this. In 2010 Nick Clegg said he could work with Labour, just not Gordon Brown. Two years later they said they could work with Labour but the shadow chancellor Ed Balls must go. The insistence that Labour couldn\u2019t get the numbers in parliament to oust Johnson and make Corbyn a caretaker prime minister is a self-fulfilling prophecy made most ardently by those who won\u2019t give him the numbers. But even if it wasn\u2019t, it is a fallacy to assume that anyone else would get any closer. When pressed on which he would prefer \u2013 \u201cIs it Jeremy Corbyn or is it no deal?\u201d \u2013 Stone eventually showed his cards. \u201cIt is no deal every time.\u201d There is candour in this. It is effectively the position of his party and many others, including a few disgruntled Labour members, for whom a potential Labour government under Corbyn is somehow worse than the actual no-deal Brexit under Johnson that may soon happen. But there is a clear contradiction too. Some of those who have devoted the past few years to stopping any kind of Brexit now claim that the only thing worse than a no-deal Brexit \u2013 the worst kind of Brexit they could possibly imagine \u2013 is the leader of the only party that can stop a no-deal Brexit. None of this is a reason to necessarily support Labour or Corbyn. There are all sorts of reasons, from antisemitism to an insufficiently pro-European stance, as to why progressives might decide not to back Labour at this moment; and the calculations are very different outside England and in those areas where tactical voting offers the best hope of getting rid of Conservatives. And given the redistributive agenda that Labour laid out at last week\u2019s conference, there are all sorts of reasons why progressives might back it, too. Political parties are not entitled to anyone\u2019s support. They must earn it. The moment they start blaming voters for not supporting them, they are sunk. That\u2019s as true for Labour under Corbyn as it was for the US Democrats under nominee Al Gore. But that does not absolve the voter from the strategic and moral responsibility of accounting for their vote. In the second round of the French presidential elections in 2002, which pitted the conservative Jacques Chirac against the far-right candidate Jean-Marie Le Pen, a Communist party local councillor, Fran\u00e7ois Giacalone, voted for the conservative. \u201cWhen the house is on fire,\u201d he said, \u201cyou don\u2019t care too much if the water you put it out with is dirty.\u201d Right now, the house is on fire. Johnson\u2019s first couple of months in office have illustrated that what\u2019s at stake is not a contest between bad and worse. This is a leader who uses the police as props; breaks the law to undermine democracy; and stokes division with rhetoric that can and has been easily co-opted by the far right, pitting a section of the population against parliament and the judiciary. Johnson\u2019s cabinet and its agenda, both with regards to Brexit and beyond, do not represent a mere shift to the right but a paradigmatic sea-change in British politics that, where Europe is concerned, may have irreversible consequences. Those who last year were literally on the fringe of the Tory party conference have this week been running the show. The coming election will not just be about opposing Brexit \u2013 it\u2019ll be about defending democratic norms. The key consequence of understanding that Corbyn is the legitimate leader of the Labour party is understanding that this fire cannot be extinguished without him. \u2022 Gary Younge is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "Sky News will return to Melbourne train platforms a year after the Victorian government sparked a war with News Corp after banning the broadcaster for interviewing the far-right extremist Blair Cottrell. \u201cWe welcome the Victorian government\u2019s decision to reinstate the bespoke Sky News weather and news service that is produced for the Melbourne Trains,\u201d a spokeswoman for Sky News said on Friday. Last August it seemed unlikely the relationship would be repaired after the transport infrastructure minister, Jacinta Allan, tweeted \u201chatred and racism have no place on our screens or in our community\u201d. The government\u2019s reaction to Sky\u2019s Cottrell scandal was challenged by Sky News, which claimed that the interview with the United Patriots Front leader was never aired on the train platforms, which only carried a news package. The then chief executive, Angelos Frangopoulos, said the ban was \u201cpolitical bullying based on lies and misrepresentation\u201d and commentator Andrew Bolt called for Allan to be sacked for \u201cunprecedented censorship\u201d. The Australian and the Herald Sun covered the ban extensively, including a comment piece from Caroline Overington that said: \u201cIt\u2019s about punishing Sky. It\u2019s 100 per cent political\u201d. On Friday the minister for public transport, Melissa Horne, said following a review of the content broadcast on the City Loop platforms, a new contract for news and entertainment content had been awarded to Sky News Australia. The broadcaster will supply a bespoke package of content for XTD Limited, which manages the screens for Metro Trains, and it will be played on a loop. The content is not the live feed of Sky News and does not include any After Dark shows. \u201cWe have strengthened the content requirements for broadcasting in the City Loop \u2013 to ensure it meets community expectations,\u201d Horne said. \u201cThis was never about one broadcaster or another \u2013 it was about ensuring that offensive content isn\u2019t broadcast to the 90 million passengers who use the City Loop every year.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The new guidelines, which now apply to news as well as advertising, include no offensive subject matter, offensive language, sexualised images or anything that would demean a person or group on the basis of ethnicity, nationality, race or religion. XTD Limited now has the capacity to review content if any complaints are received from commuters, something not possible under the old contract. While Sky insists the Cottrell interview was never shown on Metro Trains, Allan\u2019s office does not accept the claim. Sky News\u2019s political editor, David Speers, told Allan in a 2018 interview that the network had confirmed the Cottrell interview had not aired on train station screens in Melbourne. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to get the grounds for this, what is the reason for this, if it\u2019s not the Blair Cottrell interview which, you acknowledge now, you\u2019re not sure whether if it was broadcast. We checked and we\u2019re sure it was not. What are you basing this on?\u201d Speers asked Allan at the time. A spokeswoman for Allan told Guardian Australia the minister received hundreds of complaints from commuters about the interview and they included the times they believed they saw the interview. Allan said last year the government had decided to pull Sky from station screens because there had a been \u201cnumber of interviews that had started to go down a slippery slope\u201d. \u201cAs the public transport minister, where it\u2019s a public asset being used to televise particular content, I think I\u2019ve got a responsibility to make sure that content is appropriate,\u201d she said.",

The new twist in the impeachment inquiry leaves no doubt that the US state department was deeply involved in the effort to use the office of the presidency to pressure a foreign government to investigate Trump\u2019s political enemies. The documents also show that Ukraine was being enlisted to discredit the Mueller investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and they reveal that diplomats even drafted a statement for Zelenskiy to read out.</p> \n<p>Earlier, Trump appeared to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/03/trump-biden-china-investigation-demand\">double down on his mounting impeachment woes</a> by openly calling for China to investigate Joe Biden despite the growing Ukraine row.

The conservationist and actors have starring roles in a new The Wind in the Willows film trailer which brings to life the 21st century threats facing the much-loved characters from Kenneth Grahame\u2019s children\u2019s classic. The animated trailer calls on everyone to help bring our wildlife back before it\u2019s too late, so that we can all enjoy a wilder future.

      "body": "<p>US diplomats told Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, that a prestigious White House visit to meet Donald Trump was dependent on him making a public statement vowing to investigate the son of Joe Biden and a Ukrainian role in the 2016 elections, according to explosive text messages released by congressional committees holding impeachment hearings into Trump\u2019s conduct.</p> <p>The texts, <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/428684384/Three-Chairs-letters-to-committees-on-intelligence-oversight-foreign-affairs-2019-10-03\">released</a> on Thursday night, show that the diplomats made clear that any improvement in Kyiv\u2019s relations with Washington would be dependent on Zelenskiy\u2019s cooperation in Trump\u2019s quest to find damaging material about Hunter Biden, the son of his leading political opponent, and on the Democrats in general.</p> <p>The conversations leave no doubt that the US state department was deeply involved in the effort to use the office of the presidency to pressure a foreign government to investigate Trump\u2019s political enemies. At one point, the diplomats even draft a statement for Zelenskiy to read out.</p> <p>The chairmen \u2013 Adam Schiff, Eliot Engel and Elijah Cummings \u2013 of the three congressional committees wrote in a statement: \u201cThis is not normal or acceptable. It is unethical, unpatriotic, and wrong. American presidents should never press foreign powers to target their domestic political rivals.

      "bodyText": "US diplomats told Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, that a prestigious White House visit to meet Donald Trump was dependent on him making a public statement vowing to investigate the son of Joe Biden and a Ukrainian role in the 2016 elections, according to explosive text messages released by congressional committees holding impeachment hearings into Trump\u2019s conduct. The texts, released on Thursday night, show that the diplomats made clear that any improvement in Kyiv\u2019s relations with Washington would be dependent on Zelenskiy\u2019s cooperation in Trump\u2019s quest to find damaging material about Hunter Biden, the son of his leading political opponent, and on the Democrats in general. The conversations leave no doubt that the US state department was deeply involved in the effort to use the office of the presidency to pressure a foreign government to investigate Trump\u2019s political enemies. At one point, the diplomats even draft a statement for Zelenskiy to read out. The chairmen \u2013 Adam Schiff, Eliot Engel and Elijah Cummings \u2013 of the three congressional committees wrote in a statement: \u201cThis is not normal or acceptable. It is unethical, unpatriotic, and wrong. American presidents should never press foreign powers to target their domestic political rivals. Engaging in these stunning abuses in broad daylight does not absolve President Trump of his wrongdoings \u2013 or his grave offenses against the constitution.\u201d Trump openly called on Ukraine to investigate the Bidens this week, but he continued to deny wrongdoing on Friday, repeating his refrain there was no \u201cquid pro quo\u201d attached to the requests. The text messages reveal that this was not the understanding of US diplomats dealing with Ukraine. In August, Zelenskiy\u2019s government became aware, through a US press report, that military aid for its struggle with Russia had been withheld by Trump in an apparent effort to increase pressure on the Ukrainian government. The texts represent exchanges from July to early September between three US diplomats \u2013 Gordon Sondland, the ambassador to the EU, Kurt Volker, the then special envoy on Ukraine, and Bill Taylor, the acting ambassador to Kyiv. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani and a Zelenskiy aide, Andrey Yermak, also make brief appearances in the correspondence. The early conversations came before a 25 July phone call between Trump and Zelenskiy that was the trigger for the impeachment proceedings now consuming Congress. They show that Sondland coached Zelenskiy on the call, making clear what would be required from him. \u201cI [spoke] to Zelenskiy and gave him a full briefing.

Volker replied: \u201cMost [important] is for Zelenskiy to say that he will help investigation \u2013 and address any specific personnel issues \u2013 if there are any.\u201d For their part, the Ukrainians were quite aware about what was happening and were deeply uneasy about what they were being asked to do.

A government body essentially investigating itself, put simply, will never hold itself accountable.</p> <p>\u201cThe burden is very much placed on the individual under the Home Office\u2019s control, more often than not with the assistance of publicly funded lawyers and NGOs, to ensure that the Home Office is held to account.

Although the department also has responsibility for policing and counter-terrorism, 96% of its internal investigations focus on immigration matters. Scores of these investigations have substantiated allegations against staff made internally or by the public. The Home Office\u2019s professional standards unit (PSU) investigates only the most serious misconduct allegations against teams or individuals within the department, or contractors such as those working in detention centres. A general complaints procedure deals with more minor matters that are not investigated by the PSU. Areas of investigation by the PSU include allegations of crimes such as assault, sexual assault, racism, theft, fraud, harassment or \u201cany behaviour likely to bring the Home Office into disrepute\u201d. The Guardian obtained a freedom of information response which revealed that in the past three years there have been 626 PSU investigations, with 210 allegations substantiated. Of the areas of the Home Office\u2019s work investigated, 96.4% of the allegations related to borders, immigration and citizenship, with only a handful relating to other important areas such as policing and counter-terrorism. The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, said the disclosures showed the Home Office\u2019s immigration and nationality department was \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d and called for an immediate review. The PSU has the power to request witness statements, CCTV footage, notebook entries, texts and voicemails on Home Office-issued mobile phones. Matters investigated may be referred to the police or other agencies where appropriate. Home Office guidance states that the issues considered by the PSU have \u201cpotential for serious reputational damage to the Home Office as well as potential legal action taken against us. An assessment of each case will be conducted by the PSU to assess for the potential risk and if there is a risk of adverse publicity.\u201d In an answer to a parliamentary question last year, the then immigration minister, Caroline Nokes, revealed there had been 25 allegations of sexual assault made by detainees against staff in immigration removal centres between 2014-15 and 2017-18. She said in her response: \u201cAny allegations of serious misconduct made by a detainee against staff in an IRC are also referred to the Home Office PSU for investigation.\u201d The Guardian requested information about recommended actions against individual members of Home Office staff contained in PSU investigation reports, but was rejected on the basis that each report would have to be examined individually and this would take more work than allowed under freedom of information request time limits. However, the Home Office guidance states that the PSU\u2019s Lessons Learned team tracks progress made on implementing recommendations in PSU reports and that there are quarterly Lessons Learned reports produced internally. Abbott said: \u201cThese figures show just how entrenched \u2018hostile environment\u2019 practices are in the Tory Home Office. The Windrush scandal has taught them nothing as they continue to rack up internal investigations with no real consequence and no substantial change. This culture is destroying lives and families every day and cannot be allowed to continue. The immigration and nationality department of the Home Office is clearly not fit for purpose, and the government must call an immediate review into its continued failings.\u201d Toufique Hossain, a director of public law at Duncan Lewis, which has obtained disclosure of some of these internal PSU reports as part of legal challenges against the Home Office in immigration matters, said: \u201cGrave concerns are raised as to Home Office failings on a daily basis. A government body essentially investigating itself, put simply, will never hold itself accountable. \u201cThe burden is very much placed on the individual under the Home Office\u2019s control, more often than not with the assistance of publicly funded lawyers and NGOs, to ensure that the Home Office is held to account. Only through these mechanisms can vulnerable individuals access courts in order to vindicate their rights.\u201d A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cWe expect the highest levels of integrity and professional conduct of both staff and contractors. The number of complaints investigated by the professional standards unit has fallen by more than 25% since 2016-17. \u201cBorders, immigration and citizenship system teams have the greatest interaction with members of the public so it is to be expected that there are higher numbers of complaints than for other non-public facing Home Office teams.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s main revenue stream lately has been as a vintner. And as with a fine wine, his film The Cotton Club, first released in 1984 to a muted response, has blossomed with age.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/28/the-irishman-review-scorsese-netflix-de-niro\">The Irishman review: Scorsese, De Niro, Pacino and Pesci are foes reunited in de-aged mob epic</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Cotton Club Encore is an expanded rework of the original, from, in <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2019/09/cotton-club-encore-release-francis-ford-coppola-lionsgate-1202732705/\">Coppola\u2019s own words</a>, a \u201cless frightened, less easily bullied\u201d director. Like the good bootlegger he is, he put half a million dollars of his own liquor money into this project. (A \u201cpresented by\u201d credit also goes to the family of Las Vegas real estate mogul, Lorenzo Doumani.) Musical numbers which were excised from the previous release are restored. The studio also demanded that the storyline focused on the African American characters be reduced. This is given greater (though still not equal) footing now. At the time The Cotton Club was a box office dud and got one of its leads nominated for a Razzie. The Cotton Club Encore (plus 35 years of distance) is absolutely terrific.</p> <p>The Cotton Club was an institution of the Harlem Renaissance, where Duke Ellington and Cab Calloway (both given moments to shine in the film) revolutionized popular music. The performers were almost exclusively black and the clientele, at least at first, was only white. The first scene in the movie shows the great African American actor Woody Strode as the doorman turning away a potential patron for being too dark.</p> <p>The d\u00e9cor at the Cotton Club fetishized the black experience for its white audiences, with a Plantation-style set and exaggerated, sexualized murals. Yet on the stage one was given the privilege to witness black excellence. The secondary story in the movie is the arc of Sandman Williams (Gregory Hines), an enormously talented tap dancer. He catches his break at the club with an act featuring his brother (played by his actual brother, Maurice) and soon falls in love with Lila Rose (Lonette McKee), one of the light-skinned \u201cCotton Club Beauties\u201d. In time, Lila Rose will struggle with whether to take advantage of her ability to pass as white and play the clubs outside of Harlem.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-5j3DBmmR4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6-5j3DBmmR4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Early on we see Sandman palling around with Dixie Dwyer (Richard Gere), a cornet player and good-natured Harlem resident. As a proxy for modern white audiences to feel secure that, yes, there were \u201csome good ones\u201d back then, Dwyer has no interest in bigotry, even if the Irish, Jewish and (eventually) Italian gangsters who run the club and its environs are quick to toss epithets around.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t to imply that Dwyer is a saint. He\u2019ll call a Jewish mob enforcer (played by Julian Beck) \u201cthat Golem\u201d and sighs that he doesn\u2019t want to be treated like an \u201cN-word\u201d. But the nuance found between a character\u2019s environment and his intentions is part of, in my opinion, what makes good storytelling.</p> <p>Dwyer\u2019s woes begin when he saves a man\u2019s life. Turns out it is legendary bootlegger Dutch Schultz (James Remar). Schultz takes a liking to him, and hires him to play music at one of his parties. (Of note: Richard Gere actually plays cornet and piano himself in this movie, and he\u2019s good!) Things get complicated when Dwyer is pressed into service as Schultz\u2019s bodyman. He\u2019s forced to chaperone Schultz\u2019s girl Vera (Diane Lane in some <em>outstanding</em> period costumes) and, wouldn\u2019t you know it, the two fall in love. The two actors have remarkable chemistry and cinematographer Stephen Goldblatt does not skimp on making the pair look gorgeous.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a20c7a3f11dbb32cfd2bd04cf25989909627551c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a20c7a3f11dbb32cfd2bd04cf25989909627551c/0_0_4096_2304/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Laurence Fishburne and Gregory Hines in The Cotton Club Encore\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Laurence Fishburne and Gregory Hines in The Cotton Club Encore.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lionsgate</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gangland mechanics and turf wars occupy a lot of the run time, and even though I\u2019ve seen approximately 450,000 mob movies I still don\u2019t really know how a \u201cnumbers racket\u201d works. It\u2019s no matter. There is an avalanche of terrific supporting roles, like Tom Waits as the Cotton Club\u2019s stage manager, Gwen Verdon as Dwyer\u2019s ex-hoofer mother, Nicolas Cage as Dwyer\u2019s hot-headed younger brother (based on an actual gangster named \u201cMad Dog\u201d Coll), Joe Dallesandro as \u201cLucky\u201d Luciano and Laurence Fishburne as a character based on \u201cBumpy\u201d Johnson. There\u2019s also Bob Hoskins (as Owney Madden, the club\u2019s owner) and Fred Gwynne (mobster \u201cBig Frenchy\u201d Demange). They are brutal criminals and murderers, yet they have an almost R2-D2/C-3P0 style look and relationship. When there isn\u2019t blood spewing, there\u2019s great warmth between them.</p> <p>Most importantly, though, The Cotton Club Encore is a jazz and tap dance exploitation film. The floorshow sequences aren\u2019t quick clips, they are full performances. The Hines Brothers are the big winners, but there are a slew of dancers, singers and performers who deservedly get a moment in the spotlight. (A personal delight was seeing Jack\u00e9e Harry doing some brassy comedy.)</p> <p>Though a theatrical run and Blu-ray release are planned, there\u2019s no possible way Coppola is going to see a return on his investment here. This is a gift to cinephiles everywhere from deep in the cellar and we\u2019re all lucky to get a sip.</p> <ul> <li><p>The Cotton Club Encore is showing at the New York film festival and will receive a US theatrical release on 11 October before a Blu-ray release on 15 November with a UK date yet to be announced</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s main revenue stream lately has been as a vintner. And as with a fine wine, his film The Cotton Club, first released in 1984 to a muted response, has blossomed with age. The Cotton Club Encore is an expanded rework of the original, from, in Coppola\u2019s own words, a \u201cless frightened, less easily bullied\u201d director. Like the good bootlegger he is, he put half a million dollars of his own liquor money into this project. (A \u201cpresented by\u201d credit also goes to the family of Las Vegas real estate mogul, Lorenzo Doumani.) Musical numbers which were excised from the previous release are restored. The studio also demanded that the storyline focused on the African American characters be reduced. This is given greater (though still not equal) footing now. At the time The Cotton Club was a box office dud and got one of its leads nominated for a Razzie. The Cotton Club Encore (plus 35 years of distance) is absolutely terrific. The Cotton Club was an institution of the Harlem Renaissance, where Duke Ellington and Cab Calloway (both given moments to shine in the film) revolutionized popular music. The performers were almost exclusively black and the clientele, at least at first, was only white. The first scene in the movie shows the great African American actor Woody Strode as the doorman turning away a potential patron for being too dark. The d\u00e9cor at the Cotton Club fetishized the black experience for its white audiences, with a Plantation-style set and exaggerated, sexualized murals. Yet on the stage one was given the privilege to witness black excellence. The secondary story in the movie is the arc of Sandman Williams (Gregory Hines), an enormously talented tap dancer. He catches his break at the club with an act featuring his brother (played by his actual brother, Maurice) and soon falls in love with Lila Rose (Lonette McKee), one of the light-skinned \u201cCotton Club Beauties\u201d. In time, Lila Rose will struggle with whether to take advantage of her ability to pass as white and play the clubs outside of Harlem. Early on we see Sandman palling around with Dixie Dwyer (Richard Gere), a cornet player and good-natured Harlem resident. As a proxy for modern white audiences to feel secure that, yes, there were \u201csome good ones\u201d back then, Dwyer has no interest in bigotry, even if the Irish, Jewish and (eventually) Italian gangsters who run the club and its environs are quick to toss epithets around. This isn\u2019t to imply that Dwyer is a saint. He\u2019ll call a Jewish mob enforcer (played by Julian Beck) \u201cthat Golem\u201d and sighs that he doesn\u2019t want to be treated like an \u201cN-word\u201d. But the nuance found between a character\u2019s environment and his intentions is part of, in my opinion, what makes good storytelling. Dwyer\u2019s woes begin when he saves a man\u2019s life. Turns out it is legendary bootlegger Dutch Schultz (James Remar). Schultz takes a liking to him, and hires him to play music at one of his parties. (Of note: Richard Gere actually plays cornet and piano himself in this movie, and he\u2019s good!) Things get complicated when Dwyer is pressed into service as Schultz\u2019s bodyman. He\u2019s forced to chaperone Schultz\u2019s girl Vera (Diane Lane in some outstanding period costumes) and, wouldn\u2019t you know it, the two fall in love. The two actors have remarkable chemistry and cinematographer Stephen Goldblatt does not skimp on making the pair look gorgeous. Gangland mechanics and turf wars occupy a lot of the run time, and even though I\u2019ve seen approximately 450,000 mob movies I still don\u2019t really know how a \u201cnumbers racket\u201d works. It\u2019s no matter. There is an avalanche of terrific supporting roles, like Tom Waits as the Cotton Club\u2019s stage manager, Gwen Verdon as Dwyer\u2019s ex-hoofer mother, Nicolas Cage as Dwyer\u2019s hot-headed younger brother (based on an actual gangster named \u201cMad Dog\u201d Coll), Joe Dallesandro as \u201cLucky\u201d Luciano and Laurence Fishburne as a character based on \u201cBumpy\u201d Johnson. There\u2019s also Bob Hoskins (as Owney Madden, the club\u2019s owner) and Fred Gwynne (mobster \u201cBig Frenchy\u201d Demange). They are brutal criminals and murderers, yet they have an almost R2-D2/C-3P0 style look and relationship. When there isn\u2019t blood spewing, there\u2019s great warmth between them. Most importantly, though, The Cotton Club Encore is a jazz and tap dance exploitation film. The floorshow sequences aren\u2019t quick clips, they are full performances. The Hines Brothers are the big winners, but there are a slew of dancers, singers and performers who deservedly get a moment in the spotlight. (A personal delight was seeing Jack\u00e9e Harry doing some brassy comedy.) Though a theatrical run and Blu-ray release are planned, there\u2019s no possible way Coppola is going to see a return on his investment here. This is a gift to cinephiles everywhere from deep in the cellar and we\u2019re all lucky to get a sip. The Cotton Club Encore is showing at the New York film festival and will receive a US theatrical release on 11 October before a Blu-ray release on 15 November with a UK date yet to be announced",

      "body": "<p>In January 2016, Charles Flores, a Texas prisoner, was moved to death watch, where inmates awaiting execution spend their final months. Seventeen years earlier, Flores had been convicted of murdering a woman in a Dallas suburb in the course of a robbery, a crime he says he did not commit. All of his appeals had been denied and his lethal injection was scheduled for 2 June.</p> <p>Flores\u2019s new neighbour on death watch, who was due to die in two weeks, gave him the name of his attorney, Gregory Gardner. Gardner specialised in fighting capital punishment convictions and had helped this man take his case to the US supreme court. Flores wrote to Gardner, telling him about the troubling course his trial had taken. No physical evidence had been presented to tie him to the murder, his defence had failed him in multiple ways and, perhaps most troublingly, the only eye witness who claimed to have seen him at the scene of the crime had been hypnotised by police during questioning.</p> <p>Hypnosis has been used as a forensic tool by US law enforcement and intelligence agencies since the second world war. Proponents argue that it allows victims and witnesses to recall traumatic events with greater clarity by detaching them from emotions that muddy the memory. In the case that led police departments across the country to begin using forensic hypnosis, a school bus driver in California, who had been <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/19/us/ed-ray-bus-driver-who-helped-save-kidnapped-children-dies-at-91.html\" title=\"\">abducted and buried alive with 26 students</a> in an underground trailer, later accurately recalled most of the licence plate of his abductors while under hypnosis. (All 27 captives survived the ordeal, after they dug themselves out of the trailer with a piece of wood.)</p> <p>That was in 1976. In recent decades, the scientific validity of forensic hypnosis has been called into question by experts who study how memory operates, especially in police interviews and courtrooms. It is one example of a growing number of forensic practices \u2013 including the analysis of blood spatter patterns and the study of what distinguishes arson from accidental fires \u2013 that prosecutors once relied on to secure convictions, but which are now considered to be unreliable. \u201cThe breadth of scientific error in forensic disciplines is breathtaking,\u201d Ben Wolff, an attorney for Flores, told me.</p> <p>After reading about Flores\u2019s case, Gardner got in touch with a hypnosis expert named Dr Steven Lynn. As a young psychologist in the 1970s, Lynn was a \u201ctrue believer\u201d in the power of hypnosis to retrieve memories, he later testified in a hearing in Flores\u2019s case. But when Lynn began to test this assumption, he found that in study after study, hypnosis actually harmed subjects\u2019 recall. It led them to \u201crecover\u201d at least as many false memories as accurate ones, while increasing their confidence in the memories\u2019 accuracy. \u201cMaybe they\u2019re having a very vivid experience during hypnosis, but that experience is not necessarily a truthful experience,\u201d Lynn told the court.</p> <p>After contacting Lynn, Gardner filed an appeal before the highest criminal court in Texas. He based the appeal on a law passed in Texas three years earlier, in May 2013, known as the junk science statute. Among other things, the statute held that convictions could be thrown out if it was shown that they relied on discredited or misused scientific evidence. It was the first law of its kind in the US and a major step forward for fighting wrongful convictions \u2013 but it had not yet been tested in a forensic hypnosis case. \u201cIt felt like we were at the casino and pushing all the chips in,\u201d Flores said.</p> <p>In an affidavit included with Flores\u2019s appeal, Lynn wrote that \u201ca significant development in the study of psychology over the past two decades or so has been the decline and fall of the idea that memory is a vast, permanent and potentially accessible storehouse of information.\u201d In a subsequent hearing, Lynn testified that the hypnosis in the Flores case had relied on this faulty concept of memory and that it may have contributed to the witness\u2019s confidence in her testimony. At trial, the witness had said she was \u201cover 100% positive\u201d that she saw Flores at the crime scene.</p> <p>On 27 May 2016, six days before he was supposed to be put to death, the court granted Flores a stay of execution and sent the case back to a lower court for review. In October 2018, that court affirmed the original conviction, which means Flores is still on death row. He is now waiting for his final appeal to be heard by Texas\u2019s highest criminal court.</p> <p>His case, along with another, similar case from Texas, could determine the future of forensic hypnosis in the state and across the country. Since 1987, the supreme court has held that information and testimony from hypnotised witnesses cannot automatically be thrown out of court. Texas is one of 13 states that allow hypnotically induced testimony, as long as the hypnosis is carried out according to certain guidelines; a further four states permit it unconditionally. Of these 17 states, 10 also have active capital punishment laws, which means they can put potentially innocent people to death on the basis of what Alexis Agathocleous, a lawyer for the Innocence Project, which works to exonerate wrongly convicted prisoners, calls \u201cdeeply unreliable\u201d evidence. Nationally, DNA evidence has been used to exonerate at least six people who were convicted of crimes partially on the basis of hypnotically induced testimony, according to data from the Innocence Project, which is now briefing the court against the use of forensic hypnosis in Flores\u2019s case.</p> <p>If Flores\u2019s appeal is successful and his conviction is overturned, Texas is highly likely to join the 27 states that have already banned the use of forensic hypnosis as a result of the growing expert consensus that it is junk science. (Another six states have no forensic hypnosis case law, leaving its legal status there highly ambiguous.) This would add the momentum of the US\u2019s second most populous state to a nationwide push to scrap the practice. If the appeal fails, Flores\u2019s case could still go to the US supreme court, which could decide to ban forensic hypnosis across the country. But Flores could also lose all his appeals, which might lead to his execution, and entrench the use of forensic hypnosis in states such as Texas.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The way hypnotists describe their art usually depends on what they want hypnosis to achieve. Those who see it as a therapeutic tool talk about it almost like a drug \u2013 one that eases physical pain and anxiety, lowers emotional defences and makes the hypnotised person open to seeing their lives in a more positive light. Those who use hypnosis forensically talk about it as if it were a searchlight, able to pick out particular memories in the murky corners of a traumatised mind.</p> <p>The very things that make hypnosis valuable in clinical circumstances \u2013 such as a hypnotised patient\u2019s openness to suggestions from the therapist and the expectation that hypnosis will work \u2013 are dangerous when it comes to trying to establish facts in settings such as a courtroom. \u201cThink of hypnosis like a memory pill,\u201d Lynn, who is also a professor of psychology at the State University of New York at Binghamton, told me. \u201cIf you believe that after you take this pill your memory will be improved, then, when questioned about whatever you recall, you will be more likely to say: \u2018Yeah that was an accurate memory, I\u2019m confident in my recall of that.\u2019 It acts almost like a placebo.\u201d</p> <p>Hypnosis is difficult to research at scale, but many small studies suggest that the relationship between hypnosis and memory is highly problematic. In 1983, a study at Concordia University in Montreal found that hypnotised subjects tend to be particularly susceptible to the implantation of false memories by hypnotists. In another study, in 2006, Lynn explored the memories of people after the death of Princess Diana. Using a range of memory recall techniques, he asked them to remember what they did on the day she died, and then fact-checked their memories. He found that hypnotised subjects remembered less than those who were not hypnotised and omitted more details. Many studies have also found that hypnosis increases subjects\u2019 confidence in their memories, regardless of whether those memories are accurate or not. This is the case even when the \u201chypnosis\u201d undergone by subjects wouldn\u2019t be recognised as such by most practitioners. \u201cSimply defining a procedure as hypnosis carries some risk that people\u2019s confidence in their memories will be boosted,\u201d Lynn said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"777ad9e5a0f4edd27156aca5c12a275c59700531\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/777ad9e5a0f4edd27156aca5c12a275c59700531/0_0_1155_1155/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Charles Flores was convicted of murder after a witness under hypnosis gave evidence against him.

He remains on death row in Texas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facebook</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many practitioners of forensic hypnosis know that it can create false memories, but it is a risk they willingly take. \u201cMore memory, how could that be a bad thing?\u201d said Carol Denicker, a hypnotist in New York state.</p> <p>Bob Erdody, a hypnosis consultant and retired NYPD officer, told me most of the information obtained in interviews can be corroborated, so false memories get weeded out. His most successful use of hypnosis was with a young man who was able to remember a decal on the window of a car involved in a shooting, which resulted in an arrest. But he also acknowledged that forensic hypnosis could be unreliable: he had consulted on a case in which hypnosis led to a wrongful charge of sexual assault.</p> <p>There is a deeper problem, though, which is that inaccurate memories are common even in non-hypnotic police interviews. An accumulating body of research shows that the thing almost every investigation relies on to some extent \u2013 witness memory \u2013 is not good forensic evidence. The Innocence Project has used DNA testing to uncover 367 wrongful convictions; almost 70% of these involved a witness misidentifying the perpetrator.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s still a common lay belief that memory works as a recording device,\u201d said Elizabeth Loftus, an expert in eyewitness identifications at the University of California at Irvine. About half of jurors believe memory works this way, according to a study Loftus conducted in 2006. Partly as a result, juries are strongly compelled by eyewitnesses, especially when those witnesses express a high degree of confidence in their memories. \u201cThe confidence expressed by a witness is the single most important factor in persuading jurors that a witness correctly identified the criminal,\u201d Lynn and his colleagues have written. As Gardner put it, \u201cit is way too risky\u201d to use such testimony, \u201cparticularly in a state that has capital punishment or life without parole\u201d.</p> <p>But if memory itself is unreliable, defenders of forensic hypnosis argue, then logically you have a choice: you can either keep forensic hypnosis, or throw out witness statements altogether. \u201cOpponents of the police use of hypnosis, they would have you believe that we don\u2019t know how to get down here to this office tomorrow or what we did yesterday or what I had for supper last night,\u201d said Marx Howell, a former Texas patrolman who, in 1979, created a forensic hypnosis training programme for Texas police and has since trained thousands of officers. \u201cMemory is fallible, but we use memory a lot. It can\u2019t be so fallible that you can\u2019t use it.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, if memory were entirely reliable, there wouldn\u2019t have been a need for something like forensic hypnosis in the first place.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Forensic hypnosis became popular, in part, because its successes were front-page news. \u201c\u2018Major Break\u2019 Expected in Mass Abduction\u201d ran the headline of an article on the cover of the New York Times in July 1976, about the buried-alive bus driver who had recalled the licence plate number of his abductors. That case was \u201cthe catalyst case for law enforcement use\u201d across the country, said Howell, who led the establishment of Texas\u2019s hypnosis programme three years later. In Los Angeles in the late 70s and early 80s, the police were conducting an average of more than 100 hypnoses per year; the head of the LAPD\u2019s hypnosis programme claimed that three-quarters of these yielded information of value to the case.</p> <p>By Howell\u2019s lights, the Texas programme was successful: he told me that during the first 10 years of its existence, roughly three out of every four forensic hypnosis sessions in the state resulted in more information. By 1986, more than 800 Texas police officers had been trained in hypnosis. In perhaps the most celebrated hypnosis case in the state in the 80s, the technique was used to solve the murder of a leftwing radical in Austin that had occurred 13 years earlier, in 1967. (The murderer in that case also killed his mother, sawed her body into pieces and scattered them along the highway between Oklahoma and Arkansas.)</p> <p>But as forensic hypnosis became more widespread, its weaknesses became more evident. In one case in Minnesota in 1980, \u201ca hypnotised person recalled eating pizza in a restaurant that did not serve pizza, seeing tattoos on someone who did not have tattoos and being stabbed with scissors or a knife where there was no physical evidence that a weapon had been used,\u201d Lynn and his colleagues have written.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Thus began \u201ca tidal change\u201d in attitudes towards forensic hypnosis among jurists and psychologists, according to Lynn and his colleagues. In 1981, New Jersey adopted a six-part test for the admissibility of hypnotically induced testimony, designed to minimise the risk that witnesses were having false memories suggested to them by the police. The following year, the supreme court of California ruled that hypnotically induced testimony was inadmissible in court. This dovetailed with the emergence among scientists of the view that memory was reconstructive rather than recording \u2013 more like collage than like photojournalism.</p> <p>In 1987, after a legal challenge by the man convicted of murdering the radical activist (and later his mother), Texas, too, adopted a set of standards for evaluating the admissibility of hypnotically induced testimony; they are known as the Zani guidelines, after the name of the killer. \u201cThe problem with hypnosis \u2026 is that it tends greatly to facilitate not only the retrieval of genuinely remembered data, but also construction of false but nevertheless plausible data to fill in gaps in true memory,\u201d wrote a judge in the Zani case. \u201cMoreover, once this \u2018confabulation\u2019 takes place, neither expert nor jury nor even the witness himself can differentiate historical fact from fantasy.\u201d</p> <p>Over the next two decades, other states followed in blocking or restricting the use of forensic hypnosis. In 2006, New Jersey abandoned its guidelines and banned the practice altogether after a case in which a hypnotised witness in a sexual assault case identified someone they couldn\u2019t possibly have seen. By this time, even one of the pioneers of forensic hypnosis, Martin Orne, who had created New Jersey\u2019s guidelines, agreed that the practice should be consigned to history. In fact, the guidelines were part of the problem, creating an illusion of reliability: it was like advertising seatbelts for a car without brakes.</p> <p>Supporters of forensic hypnosis argue that the practice shouldn\u2019t be banned because of a few bad cases. \u201cThey threw the baby out with the bathwater,\u201d Howell said of the 2006 decision in New Jersey. But the push to end forensic hypnosis has been part of a broader movement against the use of junk science to convict people. In 2004, in one of the most famous junk science cases, Texas executed Cameron Todd Willingham for the murder by arson of his three children on the basis of scientific techniques which have since been discredited. This ultimately led to the creation of the Texas Forensic Science Commission, which examines junk science, and the junk science statute that is now being used to challenge Flores\u2019s conviction.</p> <p>Texas\u2019s \u201cforensic commission represents the gold standard\u201d for determining what sorts of evidence should be allowed in court, said Agathocleous, the Innocence Project lawyer. The state has worked its way through a handful of junk science issues, such as the use of bite marks to identify a suspect (now totally debunked) and the practice of matching hairs found at a crime scene to suspects. Forensic hypnosis could be next. But whether the science that could sway the commission will be heeded by the criminal court hearing Flores\u2019s appeal is a separate question. \u201cHopefully the Texas court understands what we now know,\u201d Agathocleous said.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The hypnosis in the case that put Flores on death row was particularly bizarre. The witness, a Dallas woman named Jill Bargainer, lived next door to the victim. Early on the morning of 29 January 1998, Bargainer thought she saw two white men get out of a yellow Volkswagen Beetle parked in her neighbour Betty Black\u2019s driveway. A couple of hours later, Betty\u2019s husband came home from work to find Betty and their doberman, Santana, shot dead.</p> <p>Later that day, at the local police station, Bargainer identified the driver of the car in a number of photo arrays. (He turned out to be the boyfriend of Betty\u2019s daughter-in-law and owned a pink and purple VW Beetle with a flame design running down the side.) Five days after that, police asked for Bargainer\u2019s help creating a composite sketch of the passenger, but by this time, she was unravelling. She told them she couldn\u2019t sleep and couldn\u2019t stop shaking, and asked if they could hypnotise her so that she could \u201crelax and do a good composite\u201d, according to subsequent testimony. Bargainer could not recall later how she knew that hypnosis was something they might offer.</p> <p>The next day, a patrol officer trained in forensic hypnosis hypnotised Bargainer. It was the first and last forensic hypnosis he ever performed. In a video recording of the session, he tells Bargainer to imagine she is sitting in a cinema, holding a remote control; she can use the remote any time she likes to stop the film, or fast forward. Hypnotists call this the \u201cmovie theatre technique\u201d. It has often been used to help emotionally traumatised witnesses feel they can control their memories.</p> <p>Bargainer mentioned a few new details in the course of the hypnosis \u2013 the first suspect was holding a beer bottle; the second had brown eyes \u2013 but nothing particularly substantive emerged. Then, at the end of the session, the officer told her that she would \u201cbe able to recall more of the events as time goes on\u201d. After the hypnosis, she helped police draw a composite sketch of the passenger she thought she saw \u2013 a thin caucasian man with long hair.</p> <p>Police then showed Bargainer a series of photo arrays including images of the person they believed to be the passenger: a heavy-set, brown-skinned, short-haired latino man, who had been caught setting the VW on fire two days after the murder \u2013 Charles Flores. But Flores did not match Bargainer\u2019s description of the passenger and she did not identify him at that time.</p> <p>Eventually, prosecutors gathered enough circumstantial evidence to prosecute Flores anyway. At his trial in February 1999, 13 months after the killing, Bargainer was called as a witness. But after she took the stand, the defence called for a Zani hearing. The Zani guidelines use a minimum of 10 criteria to determine whether the testimony of a previously hypnotised witness should be admissible in court. The criteria include: the interviewer should not be otherwise involved in the case; a recording of the hypnosis should be made that shows everyone in the room at the time of the hypnosis; and no suggestions should be made to the hypnotee.</p> <p>Despite the fact that Bargainer\u2019s hypnosis violated these three guidelines and a number of the other ones, the judge allowed Bargainer to take the stand. In a shocking reversal of what she had told police during the investigation, she identified Flores, who was sitting at the defence table, as the second man she saw that morning.</p> <p>Lynn called the identification \u201castounding\u201d. \u201cI cannot tell you a single time, personally, when I couldn\u2019t recognise something and then 13 months later I was completely positive,\u201d he told a court hearing in the Flores case in 2017. Lynn considered it particularly problematic that the hypnotist told Bargainer she would remember more as time went on.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact that Flores has found some people to be hoodwinked by his media show sounds good and makes for a good article, but is not what happened here,\u201d Jason January, the prosecutor who secured Flores\u2019s original conviction, told me. Several people testified in court that they had seen Flores with the other suspect on the day of the murder, and another testified that Flores had admitted to shooting the dog. January called the murder \u201can open and shut case\u201d. Bargainer\u2019s inability to identify Flores until the trial did not bother him, he said, because people\u2019s appearance can change and in-court identifications happen all the time. The hypnosis was a way to relax, he said \u2013 a \u201cglorified spa session\u201d. He didn\u2019t see any reason that Flores\u2019s conviction should be overturned, or to ban forensic hypnosis in general.</p> <p>But those supporting Flores, including Agathocleous, believe his case is an extraordinarily compelling example of why forensic hypnosis should be banned. \u201cSo many of the different misidentification phenomena all appear\u201d in the Flores case, Agathocleous said. These include the low, early morning light in which Bargainer saw the suspects; the short amount of time she saw them; the fact that she was standing at a significant distance from them; the mismatch between her initial description of the second suspect and Flores; the development of a composite sketch, which is known to compromise eyewitness memory; the use of a suggestive photo array in which Flores stood out; the eyewitness\u2019s failure to identify Flores in that array; and the eyewitness\u2019s exposure to media images of Flores after his arrest. \u201cThen, given the interaction between the unreliable identification and the overlay of hypnosis,\u201d Agathocleous added, \u201cthere are very, very troubling questions here.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>While he waits indefinitely for a decision from Texas\u2019s court of criminal appeals, Flores spends a lot of time in his cell on death row, meditating and writing. If he wins his appeal, his case will go back down to a trial court for a new trial, two decades after the first one. In the meantime, the driver of the Volkswagen struck a deal in 2000 after pleading guilty to the murder and indicating the gun used in the crime was his, and has been out on parole for three years. (Under Texas law, multiple people can be found guilty of a murder if it happens in the course of them committing another crime, like the robbery in the Flores case.)</p> <p>But there is still a high chance that Texas will eventually execute Flores. In a cruel irony, his case has drawn enough attention to the problems with forensic hypnosis that, even if the state does put him to death, it may still ban forensic hypnosis.</p> <p>One of the key figures challenging the practice is Juan Hinojosa, a Texas state senator who has been involved in fighting the use of forensic junk science since the early 2000s, when he was deeply upset by the execution of Todd Willingham, <a href=\"https://www.innocenceproject.org/cameron-todd-willingham-wrongfully-convicted-and-executed-in-texas/\" title=\"\">the man wrongfully convicted</a> and then executed for burning his children to death. \u201cI think quite frankly, we convicted wrongfully an innocent man,\u201d Hinojosa told me. In the wake of Willingham\u2019s execution, he worked to establish the Forensic Science Commission. The goal, he said, was to have forensics \u201cbased on some actual research and data, and not just on somebody\u2019s intuition or bias within the criminal justice system\u201d. He also began to read widely about other potentially dubious forms of forensic science, including hypnosis. He has been trying to pass a bill that would make hypnotically induced testimony automatically inadmissible in Texas courts.</p> <p>In another high-profile case involving forensic hypnosis, Kosoul Chanthakoummane, a friend of Flores\u2019s on death row, is also awaiting a decision from the criminal court of appeals. He was convicted in 2007 for the killing of a real estate agent in McKinney, Texas. A hypnotised witness was also used in this case, alongside bite mark analysis and questionable DNA evidence. The case has so many bits of forensic science gone wrong that Ben Wolff, Flores\u2019s lawyer, calls it a \u201cparade of horrors\u201d. This case, too, could help sway the Texas judiciary against forensic hypnosis.</p> <p>\u201cThe timing is critical,\u201d Agathocleous said of Flores\u2019s case. The US is in the midst of a vast re-evaluation of the validity of many kinds of forensic evidence. In addition to blood spatter analysis, arson science, bite mark analysis and hair microscopy, practices such as ballistics testing and picking suspects out of line-ups using sniffer dogs have all been challenged to varying degrees. Even the validity of matching a <a href=\"https://www.aaas.org/resources/latent-fingerprint-examination\" title=\"\">suspect\u2019s fingerprints</a> to those found at a crime scene has been called into question. This could aid Flores\u2019s case and the movement to end forensic hypnosis nationwide.</p> <p>But banning forensic hypnosis opens up bigger questions than those posed by the end of some other forensic techniques. It points to the need for a broader reconsideration of the way that police and prosecutors influence the memories of witnesses and suspects. \u201cInaccurate memories that eyewitnesses express with any degree of inflated certainty in the courtroom can carry life or death consequences,\u201d Steven Lynn told me. What do we do with this dangerous thing that courts have been relying on since time immemorial, that we need to be able to rely on, even when it proves so fleeting? As lawyers from the Innocence Project put it in a brief in Flores\u2019s case, \u201cmemory can be easily contaminated\u201d \u2013 just like a crime scene.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In January 2016, Charles Flores, a Texas prisoner, was moved to death watch, where inmates awaiting execution spend their final months. Seventeen years earlier, Flores had been convicted of murdering a woman in a Dallas suburb in the course of a robbery, a crime he says he did not commit. All of his appeals had been denied and his lethal injection was scheduled for 2 June. Flores\u2019s new neighbour on death watch, who was due to die in two weeks, gave him the name of his attorney, Gregory Gardner. Gardner specialised in fighting capital punishment convictions and had helped this man take his case to the US supreme court. Flores wrote to Gardner, telling him about the troubling course his trial had taken. No physical evidence had been presented to tie him to the murder, his defence had failed him in multiple ways and, perhaps most troublingly, the only eye witness who claimed to have seen him at the scene of the crime had been hypnotised by police during questioning. Hypnosis has been used as a forensic tool by US law enforcement and intelligence agencies since the second world war. Proponents argue that it allows victims and witnesses to recall traumatic events with greater clarity by detaching them from emotions that muddy the memory. In the case that led police departments across the country to begin using forensic hypnosis, a school bus driver in California, who had been abducted and buried alive with 26 students in an underground trailer, later accurately recalled most of the licence plate of his abductors while under hypnosis. (All 27 captives survived the ordeal, after they dug themselves out of the trailer with a piece of wood.) That was in 1976. In recent decades, the scientific validity of forensic hypnosis has been called into question by experts who study how memory operates, especially in police interviews and courtrooms. It is one example of a growing number of forensic practices \u2013 including the analysis of blood spatter patterns and the study of what distinguishes arson from accidental fires \u2013 that prosecutors once relied on to secure convictions, but which are now considered to be unreliable. \u201cThe breadth of scientific error in forensic disciplines is breathtaking,\u201d Ben Wolff, an attorney for Flores, told me. After reading about Flores\u2019s case, Gardner got in touch with a hypnosis expert named Dr Steven Lynn. As a young psychologist in the 1970s, Lynn was a \u201ctrue believer\u201d in the power of hypnosis to retrieve memories, he later testified in a hearing in Flores\u2019s case. But when Lynn began to test this assumption, he found that in study after study, hypnosis actually harmed subjects\u2019 recall. It led them to \u201crecover\u201d at least as many false memories as accurate ones, while increasing their confidence in the memories\u2019 accuracy. \u201cMaybe they\u2019re having a very vivid experience during hypnosis, but that experience is not necessarily a truthful experience,\u201d Lynn told the court. After contacting Lynn, Gardner filed an appeal before the highest criminal court in Texas. He based the appeal on a law passed in Texas three years earlier, in May 2013, known as the junk science statute. Among other things, the statute held that convictions could be thrown out if it was shown that they relied on discredited or misused scientific evidence. It was the first law of its kind in the US and a major step forward for fighting wrongful convictions \u2013 but it had not yet been tested in a forensic hypnosis case. \u201cIt felt like we were at the casino and pushing all the chips in,\u201d Flores said. In an affidavit included with Flores\u2019s appeal, Lynn wrote that \u201ca significant development in the study of psychology over the past two decades or so has been the decline and fall of the idea that memory is a vast, permanent and potentially accessible storehouse of information.\u201d In a subsequent hearing, Lynn testified that the hypnosis in the Flores case had relied on this faulty concept of memory and that it may have contributed to the witness\u2019s confidence in her testimony. At trial, the witness had said she was \u201cover 100% positive\u201d that she saw Flores at the crime scene. On 27 May 2016, six days before he was supposed to be put to death, the court granted Flores a stay of execution and sent the case back to a lower court for review. In October 2018, that court affirmed the original conviction, which means Flores is still on death row. He is now waiting for his final appeal to be heard by Texas\u2019s highest criminal court. His case, along with another, similar case from Texas, could determine the future of forensic hypnosis in the state and across the country. Since 1987, the supreme court has held that information and testimony from hypnotised witnesses cannot automatically be thrown out of court. Texas is one of 13 states that allow hypnotically induced testimony, as long as the hypnosis is carried out according to certain guidelines; a further four states permit it unconditionally. Of these 17 states, 10 also have active capital punishment laws, which means they can put potentially innocent people to death on the basis of what Alexis Agathocleous, a lawyer for the Innocence Project, which works to exonerate wrongly convicted prisoners, calls \u201cdeeply unreliable\u201d evidence. Nationally, DNA evidence has been used to exonerate at least six people who were convicted of crimes partially on the basis of hypnotically induced testimony, according to data from the Innocence Project, which is now briefing the court against the use of forensic hypnosis in Flores\u2019s case. If Flores\u2019s appeal is successful and his conviction is overturned, Texas is highly likely to join the 27 states that have already banned the use of forensic hypnosis as a result of the growing expert consensus that it is junk science. (Another six states have no forensic hypnosis case law, leaving its legal status there highly ambiguous.) This would add the momentum of the US\u2019s second most populous state to a nationwide push to scrap the practice. If the appeal fails, Flores\u2019s case could still go to the US supreme court, which could decide to ban forensic hypnosis across the country. But Flores could also lose all his appeals, which might lead to his execution, and entrench the use of forensic hypnosis in states such as Texas. * * * The way hypnotists describe their art usually depends on what they want hypnosis to achieve. Those who see it as a therapeutic tool talk about it almost like a drug \u2013 one that eases physical pain and anxiety, lowers emotional defences and makes the hypnotised person open to seeing their lives in a more positive light. Those who use hypnosis forensically talk about it as if it were a searchlight, able to pick out particular memories in the murky corners of a traumatised mind. The very things that make hypnosis valuable in clinical circumstances \u2013 such as a hypnotised patient\u2019s openness to suggestions from the therapist and the expectation that hypnosis will work \u2013 are dangerous when it comes to trying to establish facts in settings such as a courtroom. \u201cThink of hypnosis like a memory pill,\u201d Lynn, who is also a professor of psychology at the State University of New York at Binghamton, told me. \u201cIf you believe that after you take this pill your memory will be improved, then, when questioned about whatever you recall, you will be more likely to say: \u2018Yeah that was an accurate memory, I\u2019m confident in my recall of that.\u2019 It acts almost like a placebo.\u201d Hypnosis is difficult to research at scale, but many small studies suggest that the relationship between hypnosis and memory is highly problematic. In 1983, a study at Concordia University in Montreal found that hypnotised subjects tend to be particularly susceptible to the implantation of false memories by hypnotists. In another study, in 2006, Lynn explored the memories of people after the death of Princess Diana. Using a range of memory recall techniques, he asked them to remember what they did on the day she died, and then fact-checked their memories. He found that hypnotised subjects remembered less than those who were not hypnotised and omitted more details. Many studies have also found that hypnosis increases subjects\u2019 confidence in their memories, regardless of whether those memories are accurate or not. This is the case even when the \u201chypnosis\u201d undergone by subjects wouldn\u2019t be recognised as such by most practitioners. \u201cSimply defining a procedure as hypnosis carries some risk that people\u2019s confidence in their memories will be boosted,\u201d Lynn said. Many practitioners of forensic hypnosis know that it can create false memories, but it is a risk they willingly take. \u201cMore memory, how could that be a bad thing?\u201d said Carol Denicker, a hypnotist in New York state. Bob Erdody, a hypnosis consultant and retired NYPD officer, told me most of the information obtained in interviews can be corroborated, so false memories get weeded out. His most successful use of hypnosis was with a young man who was able to remember a decal on the window of a car involved in a shooting, which resulted in an arrest. But he also acknowledged that forensic hypnosis could be unreliable: he had consulted on a case in which hypnosis led to a wrongful charge of sexual assault. There is a deeper problem, though, which is that inaccurate memories are common even in non-hypnotic police interviews. An accumulating body of research shows that the thing almost every investigation relies on to some extent \u2013 witness memory \u2013 is not good forensic evidence. The Innocence Project has used DNA testing to uncover 367 wrongful convictions; almost 70% of these involved a witness misidentifying the perpetrator. \u201cThere\u2019s still a common lay belief that memory works as a recording device,\u201d said Elizabeth Loftus, an expert in eyewitness identifications at the University of California at Irvine. About half of jurors believe memory works this way, according to a study Loftus conducted in 2006. Partly as a result, juries are strongly compelled by eyewitnesses, especially when those witnesses express a high degree of confidence in their memories. \u201cThe confidence expressed by a witness is the single most important factor in persuading jurors that a witness correctly identified the criminal,\u201d Lynn and his colleagues have written. As Gardner put it, \u201cit is way too risky\u201d to use such testimony, \u201cparticularly in a state that has capital punishment or life without parole\u201d. But if memory itself is unreliable, defenders of forensic hypnosis argue, then logically you have a choice: you can either keep forensic hypnosis, or throw out witness statements altogether. \u201cOpponents of the police use of hypnosis, they would have you believe that we don\u2019t know how to get down here to this office tomorrow or what we did yesterday or what I had for supper last night,\u201d said Marx Howell, a former Texas patrolman who, in 1979, created a forensic hypnosis training programme for Texas police and has since trained thousands of officers. \u201cMemory is fallible, but we use memory a lot. It can\u2019t be so fallible that you can\u2019t use it.\u201d Of course, if memory were entirely reliable, there wouldn\u2019t have been a need for something like forensic hypnosis in the first place. * * * Forensic hypnosis became popular, in part, because its successes were front-page news. \u201c\u2018Major Break\u2019 Expected in Mass Abduction\u201d ran the headline of an article on the cover of the New York Times in July 1976, about the buried-alive bus driver who had recalled the licence plate number of his abductors. That case was \u201cthe catalyst case for law enforcement use\u201d across the country, said Howell, who led the establishment of Texas\u2019s hypnosis programme three years later. In Los Angeles in the late 70s and early 80s, the police were conducting an average of more than 100 hypnoses per year; the head of the LAPD\u2019s hypnosis programme claimed that three-quarters of these yielded information of value to the case. By Howell\u2019s lights, the Texas programme was successful: he told me that during the first 10 years of its existence, roughly three out of every four forensic hypnosis sessions in the state resulted in more information. By 1986, more than 800 Texas police officers had been trained in hypnosis. In perhaps the most celebrated hypnosis case in the state in the 80s, the technique was used to solve the murder of a leftwing radical in Austin that had occurred 13 years earlier, in 1967. (The murderer in that case also killed his mother, sawed her body into pieces and scattered them along the highway between Oklahoma and Arkansas.) But as forensic hypnosis became more widespread, its weaknesses became more evident. In one case in Minnesota in 1980, \u201ca hypnotised person recalled eating pizza in a restaurant that did not serve pizza, seeing tattoos on someone who did not have tattoos and being stabbed with scissors or a knife where there was no physical evidence that a weapon had been used,\u201d Lynn and his colleagues have written. Thus began \u201ca tidal change\u201d in attitudes towards forensic hypnosis among jurists and psychologists, according to Lynn and his colleagues. In 1981, New Jersey adopted a six-part test for the admissibility of hypnotically induced testimony, designed to minimise the risk that witnesses were having false memories suggested to them by the police. The following year, the supreme court of California ruled that hypnotically induced testimony was inadmissible in court. This dovetailed with the emergence among scientists of the view that memory was reconstructive rather than recording \u2013 more like collage than like photojournalism. In 1987, after a legal challenge by the man convicted of murdering the radical activist (and later his mother), Texas, too, adopted a set of standards for evaluating the admissibility of hypnotically induced testimony; they are known as the Zani guidelines, after the name of the killer. \u201cThe problem with hypnosis \u2026 is that it tends greatly to facilitate not only the retrieval of genuinely remembered data, but also construction of false but nevertheless plausible data to fill in gaps in true memory,\u201d wrote a judge in the Zani case. \u201cMoreover, once this \u2018confabulation\u2019 takes place, neither expert nor jury nor even the witness himself can differentiate historical fact from fantasy.\u201d Over the next two decades, other states followed in blocking or restricting the use of forensic hypnosis. In 2006, New Jersey abandoned its guidelines and banned the practice altogether after a case in which a hypnotised witness in a sexual assault case identified someone they couldn\u2019t possibly have seen. By this time, even one of the pioneers of forensic hypnosis, Martin Orne, who had created New Jersey\u2019s guidelines, agreed that the practice should be consigned to history. In fact, the guidelines were part of the problem, creating an illusion of reliability: it was like advertising seatbelts for a car without brakes. Supporters of forensic hypnosis argue that the practice shouldn\u2019t be banned because of a few bad cases. \u201cThey threw the baby out with the bathwater,\u201d Howell said of the 2006 decision in New Jersey. But the push to end forensic hypnosis has been part of a broader movement against the use of junk science to convict people. In 2004, in one of the most famous junk science cases, Texas executed Cameron Todd Willingham for the murder by arson of his three children on the basis of scientific techniques which have since been discredited. This ultimately led to the creation of the Texas Forensic Science Commission, which examines junk science, and the junk science statute that is now being used to challenge Flores\u2019s conviction. Texas\u2019s \u201cforensic commission represents the gold standard\u201d for determining what sorts of evidence should be allowed in court, said Agathocleous, the Innocence Project lawyer. The state has worked its way through a handful of junk science issues, such as the use of bite marks to identify a suspect (now totally debunked) and the practice of matching hairs found at a crime scene to suspects. Forensic hypnosis could be next. But whether the science that could sway the commission will be heeded by the criminal court hearing Flores\u2019s appeal is a separate question. \u201cHopefully the Texas court understands what we now know,\u201d Agathocleous said. * * * The hypnosis in the case that put Flores on death row was particularly bizarre. The witness, a Dallas woman named Jill Bargainer, lived next door to the victim. Early on the morning of 29 January 1998, Bargainer thought she saw two white men get out of a yellow Volkswagen Beetle parked in her neighbour Betty Black\u2019s driveway. A couple of hours later, Betty\u2019s husband came home from work to find Betty and their doberman, Santana, shot dead. Later that day, at the local police station, Bargainer identified the driver of the car in a number of photo arrays. (He turned out to be the boyfriend of Betty\u2019s daughter-in-law and owned a pink and purple VW Beetle with a flame design running down the side.) Five days after that, police asked for Bargainer\u2019s help creating a composite sketch of the passenger, but by this time, she was unravelling. She told them she couldn\u2019t sleep and couldn\u2019t stop shaking, and asked if they could hypnotise her so that she could \u201crelax and do a good composite\u201d, according to subsequent testimony. Bargainer could not recall later how she knew that hypnosis was something they might offer. The next day, a patrol officer trained in forensic hypnosis hypnotised Bargainer. It was the first and last forensic hypnosis he ever performed. In a video recording of the session, he tells Bargainer to imagine she is sitting in a cinema, holding a remote control; she can use the remote any time she likes to stop the film, or fast forward. Hypnotists call this the \u201cmovie theatre technique\u201d. It has often been used to help emotionally traumatised witnesses feel they can control their memories. Bargainer mentioned a few new details in the course of the hypnosis \u2013 the first suspect was holding a beer bottle; the second had brown eyes \u2013 but nothing particularly substantive emerged. Then, at the end of the session, the officer told her that she would \u201cbe able to recall more of the events as time goes on\u201d. After the hypnosis, she helped police draw a composite sketch of the passenger she thought she saw \u2013 a thin caucasian man with long hair. Police then showed Bargainer a series of photo arrays including images of the person they believed to be the passenger: a heavy-set, brown-skinned, short-haired latino man, who had been caught setting the VW on fire two days after the murder \u2013 Charles Flores. But Flores did not match Bargainer\u2019s description of the passenger and she did not identify him at that time. Eventually, prosecutors gathered enough circumstantial evidence to prosecute Flores anyway. At his trial in February 1999, 13 months after the killing, Bargainer was called as a witness. But after she took the stand, the defence called for a Zani hearing. The Zani guidelines use a minimum of 10 criteria to determine whether the testimony of a previously hypnotised witness should be admissible in court. The criteria include: the interviewer should not be otherwise involved in the case; a recording of the hypnosis should be made that shows everyone in the room at the time of the hypnosis; and no suggestions should be made to the hypnotee. Despite the fact that Bargainer\u2019s hypnosis violated these three guidelines and a number of the other ones, the judge allowed Bargainer to take the stand. In a shocking reversal of what she had told police during the investigation, she identified Flores, who was sitting at the defence table, as the second man she saw that morning. Lynn called the identification \u201castounding\u201d. \u201cI cannot tell you a single time, personally, when I couldn\u2019t recognise something and then 13 months later I was completely positive,\u201d he told a court hearing in the Flores case in 2017. Lynn considered it particularly problematic that the hypnotist told Bargainer she would remember more as time went on. \u201cThe fact that Flores has found some people to be hoodwinked by his media show sounds good and makes for a good article, but is not what happened here,\u201d Jason January, the prosecutor who secured Flores\u2019s original conviction, told me. Several people testified in court that they had seen Flores with the other suspect on the day of the murder, and another testified that Flores had admitted to shooting the dog. January called the murder \u201can open and shut case\u201d. Bargainer\u2019s inability to identify Flores until the trial did not bother him, he said, because people\u2019s appearance can change and in-court identifications happen all the time. The hypnosis was a way to relax, he said \u2013 a \u201cglorified spa session\u201d. He didn\u2019t see any reason that Flores\u2019s conviction should be overturned, or to ban forensic hypnosis in general. But those supporting Flores, including Agathocleous, believe his case is an extraordinarily compelling example of why forensic hypnosis should be banned. \u201cSo many of the different misidentification phenomena all appear\u201d in the Flores case, Agathocleous said. These include the low, early morning light in which Bargainer saw the suspects; the short amount of time she saw them; the fact that she was standing at a significant distance from them; the mismatch between her initial description of the second suspect and Flores; the development of a composite sketch, which is known to compromise eyewitness memory; the use of a suggestive photo array in which Flores stood out; the eyewitness\u2019s failure to identify Flores in that array; and the eyewitness\u2019s exposure to media images of Flores after his arrest. \u201cThen, given the interaction between the unreliable identification and the overlay of hypnosis,\u201d Agathocleous added, \u201cthere are very, very troubling questions here.\u201d * * * While he waits indefinitely for a decision from Texas\u2019s court of criminal appeals, Flores spends a lot of time in his cell on death row, meditating and writing. If he wins his appeal, his case will go back down to a trial court for a new trial, two decades after the first one. In the meantime, the driver of the Volkswagen struck a deal in 2000 after pleading guilty to the murder and indicating the gun used in the crime was his, and has been out on parole for three years. (Under Texas law, multiple people can be found guilty of a murder if it happens in the course of them committing another crime, like the robbery in the Flores case.) But there is still a high chance that Texas will eventually execute Flores. In a cruel irony, his case has drawn enough attention to the problems with forensic hypnosis that, even if the state does put him to death, it may still ban forensic hypnosis. One of the key figures challenging the practice is Juan Hinojosa, a Texas state senator who has been involved in fighting the use of forensic junk science since the early 2000s, when he was deeply upset by the execution of Todd Willingham, the man wrongfully convicted and then executed for burning his children to death. \u201cI think quite frankly, we convicted wrongfully an innocent man,\u201d Hinojosa told me. In the wake of Willingham\u2019s execution, he worked to establish the Forensic Science Commission. The goal, he said, was to have forensics \u201cbased on some actual research and data, and not just on somebody\u2019s intuition or bias within the criminal justice system\u201d. He also began to read widely about other potentially dubious forms of forensic science, including hypnosis. He has been trying to pass a bill that would make hypnotically induced testimony automatically inadmissible in Texas courts. In another high-profile case involving forensic hypnosis, Kosoul Chanthakoummane, a friend of Flores\u2019s on death row, is also awaiting a decision from the criminal court of appeals. He was convicted in 2007 for the killing of a real estate agent in McKinney, Texas. A hypnotised witness was also used in this case, alongside bite mark analysis and questionable DNA evidence. The case has so many bits of forensic science gone wrong that Ben Wolff, Flores\u2019s lawyer, calls it a \u201cparade of horrors\u201d. This case, too, could help sway the Texas judiciary against forensic hypnosis. \u201cThe timing is critical,\u201d Agathocleous said of Flores\u2019s case. The US is in the midst of a vast re-evaluation of the validity of many kinds of forensic evidence. In addition to blood spatter analysis, arson science, bite mark analysis and hair microscopy, practices such as ballistics testing and picking suspects out of line-ups using sniffer dogs have all been challenged to varying degrees. Even the validity of matching a suspect\u2019s fingerprints to those found at a crime scene has been called into question. This could aid Flores\u2019s case and the movement to end forensic hypnosis nationwide. But banning forensic hypnosis opens up bigger questions than those posed by the end of some other forensic techniques. It points to the need for a broader reconsideration of the way that police and prosecutors influence the memories of witnesses and suspects. \u201cInaccurate memories that eyewitnesses express with any degree of inflated certainty in the courtroom can carry life or death consequences,\u201d Steven Lynn told me. What do we do with this dangerous thing that courts have been relying on since time immemorial, that we need to be able to rely on, even when it proves so fleeting? As lawyers from the Innocence Project put it in a brief in Flores\u2019s case, \u201cmemory can be easily contaminated\u201d \u2013 just like a crime scene. \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

How much of someone\u2019s intimate family life anyone should expect to buy for the price of a takeaway coffee is a tricky question. But as a rough guide, the devil offered Faust eternal life in exchange for his soul.</p> <p>There is no guarantee that the Sussexes\u2019 novel court case will succeed, still less that it will solve a journalistic dilemma that is as much moral as legal. This isn\u2019t one of those landmark cases pitting privacy against the public interest \u2013 it\u2019s hard to see what higher cause is served by knowing exactly how upset Meghan was with her father \u2013 but nor is it a classic tale of journalistic malpractice.</p> <p>The Duchess\u2019s privacy was invaded not via a long lens, rifled dustbin or hacked phone, but by her own father, who shared the letter with the newspaper after his daughter\u2019s friends criticised him in a magazine article, and one suspects it\u2019s the personal betrayal that really stings. (The couple claim the letter was edited to make Meghan look bad, but their case is primarily based on a mix of privacy, copyright and data protection legislation rather than libel law; if he can\u2019t be persuaded to stop talking about what is obviously a difficult relationship, the aim is presumably to put whatever her father says off limits.)</p> <p>The closest parallel is perhaps with the cricketer Ben Stokes\u2019s attack on the Sun for revealing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/17/ben-stokes-attacks-despicable-sun-story-family-tragedy\" title=\"\">details of a family tragedy</a> that happened before he was born. Although it was a matter of public record in New Zealand, and another relative apparently tipped off the paper, Stokes\u2019s argument that his mother shouldn\u2019t be forced to relive such memories just because her son is famous struck home. It\u2019s easier not to think about the human fallout of a juicy story, just as it\u2019s easier not to think about the relationship between a plastic-wrapped pork chop and a live pig, but that doesn\u2019t magic it away.</p> <p>So put aside, just for a moment, perfectly legitimate questions about whether the eco-conscious Sussexes take too many <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/aug/19/elton-john-defends-harry-and-meghan-over-use-of-private-jets\" title=\"\">private jets</a> or Harry is overly sensitive.

For those who want their money\u2019s worth, the pound of flesh they paid to see, here it is in all its naked glory. But it\u2019s the crowd, not the people stripped bare before them, who seem diminished by the sight.</p> <p>\u2022 Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Prince Harry\u2019s outburst this week against a tabloid media he feels has trashed his wife is said to have been made against aides\u2019 advice, and the statement certainly reads like he wrote it himself. Announcing a landmark legal case against the Mail on Sunday, over its publication of a private letter from Meghan to her estranged father, the prince raged that the couple would not endure \u201cpainful\u201d intrusions in silence. Having lost his mother, his greatest fear was watching someone else he loved become \u201ccommoditised to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person\u201d. The bad news for the Sussexes, however, is that this is exactly what celebrity culture does. They are part of an industry based on real lives being tidily repackaged for public consumption and sold on for profit \u2013 or in the Windsors\u2019 case, public subsidy \u2013 and one in which feelings are little more than an inconvenience. \u201cI used to read magazines when I was little and see all these Hollywood people break up and they didn\u2019t feel like real people,\u201d TV presenter Maya Jama explained this week, talking about her public breakup with the grime star Stormzy. \u201cAnd then when you\u2019re in that position, you\u2019re like, \u2018Oh shit it\u2019s very real\u2019. Everybody just sees it as entertainment.\u201d The private lives of celebrities \u2013 which is essentially what the young royals are \u2013 have become another part of the show, with actors berated if they won\u2019t spill their guts about their private lives in interviews to promote the movie. Buy a cinema ticket, or pay for a princess\u2019s expensive house renovations, and punters expect to own a piece of you. Yet there\u2019s something creepy about the clamour for the Sussexes to put out; to cough up more \u201cproper\u201d pictures of baby Archie \u2013 none of those coy Instagram shots, revealing a tiny hand but little else \u2013 and quit whining about invasion of privacy. The argument is reminiscent of drunk suits braying at a lap dancer they don\u2019t feel has gone far enough for the money; so what if Meghan wants to keep some things private, to maintain at least some kind of boundary? She took the cash! She doesn\u2019t get to choose! Somewhere beneath all of this, meanwhile, lurk uglier assumptions that this particular princess \u2013 a mixed-race American divorcee from an ordinary background \u2013 might be fair game in a way other royal brides were not. The royal family cost the nation \u00a382m in the last financial year. It\u2019s an obscene amount of money for one family and doubtless most of us could envisage better ways of spending it, but boils down to \u00a32.65 per taxpayer per year. How much of someone\u2019s intimate family life anyone should expect to buy for the price of a takeaway coffee is a tricky question. But as a rough guide, the devil offered Faust eternal life in exchange for his soul. There is no guarantee that the Sussexes\u2019 novel court case will succeed, still less that it will solve a journalistic dilemma that is as much moral as legal. This isn\u2019t one of those landmark cases pitting privacy against the public interest \u2013 it\u2019s hard to see what higher cause is served by knowing exactly how upset Meghan was with her father \u2013 but nor is it a classic tale of journalistic malpractice. The Duchess\u2019s privacy was invaded not via a long lens, rifled dustbin or hacked phone, but by her own father, who shared the letter with the newspaper after his daughter\u2019s friends criticised him in a magazine article, and one suspects it\u2019s the personal betrayal that really stings. (The couple claim the letter was edited to make Meghan look bad, but their case is primarily based on a mix of privacy, copyright and data protection legislation rather than libel law; if he can\u2019t be persuaded to stop talking about what is obviously a difficult relationship, the aim is presumably to put whatever her father says off limits.) The closest parallel is perhaps with the cricketer Ben Stokes\u2019s attack on the Sun for revealing details of a family tragedy that happened before he was born. Although it was a matter of public record in New Zealand, and another relative apparently tipped off the paper, Stokes\u2019s argument that his mother shouldn\u2019t be forced to relive such memories just because her son is famous struck home. It\u2019s easier not to think about the human fallout of a juicy story, just as it\u2019s easier not to think about the relationship between a plastic-wrapped pork chop and a live pig, but that doesn\u2019t magic it away. So put aside, just for a moment, perfectly legitimate questions about whether the eco-conscious Sussexes take too many private jets or Harry is overly sensitive. Strip away the impossibly gilded lives, and what\u2019s left is the product of two damaged childhoods; the motherless son and the woman whose father failed to show at her wedding. For those who want their money\u2019s worth, the pound of flesh they paid to see, here it is in all its naked glory. But it\u2019s the crowd, not the people stripped bare before them, who seem diminished by the sight. \u2022 Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "Arson, assault, harassment and vandalism: as the rising cost of housing funnels more Los Angeles residents out of their homes and onto the streets, homeless people and their advocates are reporting an alarming rise in vigilante attacks against the unhoused. In late August, a fast-moving fire in the hip, residential neighborhood of Eagle Rock briefly dominated headlines when it temporarily closed down two freeways and triggered a small-scale evacuation. In the week that followed, authorities revealed the fire had started in a homeless encampment, and was set by two men, one the son of the local chamber of commerce president. No one was injured, but prosecutors are reportedly considering charges of attempted murder. By the time of the Eagle Rock fire, advocates for the homeless say they had already clocked a steady rise in vigilantism. Statistics have long shown that the homeless are more likely than the housed to be the victims of a variety of crimes. The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) doesn\u2019t keep specific records of vigilante attacks against the homeless. But in interviews with close to a dozen people who live on the streets and in their cars, all said there had been a noticeable increase in attacks and harassment from people who target them for being homeless over the past year. Many of those attacks have occurred in the San Fernando Valley, a sprawling network of suburbs with a growing homeless population. \u2018I try not to sleep\u2019 Chris was attacked on the streets of North Hollywood, about three months ago. It was about 8.30 am, he said, and he and an elderly friend were both asleep. \u201cWe both were attacked, and were both cursed at, and being instructed to get the F out of here, get the F on,\u201d Chris, who asked to be identified only by his first name for fear of reprisal, recalled. \u201cI had a television thrown at my head while I was sleeping. My ear was bleeding. Thank god it didn\u2019t hit my face. And they threw a full trash can at [the] elderly woman, who I affectionately call Mom.\u201d Chris doesn\u2019t know the identity of his attackers. He\u2019s had a hard time sleeping since the incident. \u201cI do have night terrors now,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, I try not to sleep. And it sucks, because you can\u2019t dream if you don\u2019t sleep, and I\u2019m a dreamer.\u201d Another woman, who asked to be identified only by the initials SK, said that she\u2019d been hit twice by the same car in two months while she was biking near the encampment where she lives in the west San Fernando Valley. It was a hit-and-run both times, she said, and she feels confident it was deliberate. Not all vigilantism takes the form of violent attacks. People report being threatened and yelled at, getting trash thrown at them, being beeped at in the middle of the night. There\u2019s also vandalism \u2013 RV\u2019s graffitied, tires slashed or punctured with nails \u2013 and persistent harassment. Even some advocates report being harassed \u2013 including having their addresses posted online \u2013 as a result of their work with the homeless. Several activists did not want to speak on the record for this story because they were worried about attracting the ire of vigilantes. Anti-homeless policy proposals The rise in vigilantism comes alongside Los Angeles policy proposals that many advocates have called anti-homeless. A draft of a new municipal law that would severely restrict where people could legally sleep outside includes a clause that some have compared to a \u201cstand your ground\u201d law for housed people against the homeless. It bans \u201cspeaking to a person in manner that \u2026 is likely to cause a reasonable person to respond immediately with a violent reaction\u201d. And the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors recently voted to support challenging a federal court ruling that makes it unconstitutional to punish or arrest people for sleeping on the streets when there\u2019s not enough housing or shelter beds available. That\u2019s indisputably the case in Los Angeles, where there are close to 59,000 people homeless and only about 15,000 shelter beds available total, according to the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority. \u201cI think the legislative process is a response to the daily calls that the city council receives from angry residents,\u201d said Jane Nguyen, the co-founder of a volunteer homeless outreach and advocacy organization that serves the Koreatown community called Ktown for All.

      "bodyText": "On the edge of the vast Empty Quarter desert that dominates the Arabian peninsula, white and brown towers rise together out of the valley floor like tall sandcastles. Once they welcomed weary caravans traversing the Silk Roads: now they stand as testimony to the ingenuity of a lost civilisation. This is the ancient walled city of Shibam, nicknamed the \u201cManhattan of the desert\u201d by the British explorer Freya Stark in the 1930s, in modern-day Yemen, a country also home to an untold number of other archeological treasures. The kingdom of Saba, ruled by the legendary Queen of Sheba, and many other dynasties of the ancient world rose and fell here, their fortunes linked to Yemen\u2019s position at the crossroads of early frankincense and spice trades between Africa and Asia. Today, as a result of Yemen\u2019s complex civil war \u2013 now in its fifth year \u2013 many of the country\u2019s wonders have been damaged or are under threat. While the destruction pales in comparison to the human cost of the conflict, the country\u2019s rich cultural heritage has also been ravaged. At least 712 mosques and 206 archeological sites have been affected since the war broke out in 2015, according to the Legal Centre for Rights and Development in Sana\u2019a. The true figures are believed to be much higher: deliberate targeting by Saudi airstrikes, Houthi rebels, Islamic State and al-Qaida, and a booming smuggling trade have all contributed to the loss of thousands of relics. Shibam, a 1,700-year-old settlement in the valley of Hadramawt, has largely escaped direct violence, but is still suffering from years of neglect, despite being a Unesco world heritage site. Named for King Shibam Bin Harith Ibn Saba, it is one of the oldest \u2013 and still one of the best \u2013 examples of vertical construction in the world. In the 16th century, Shibam\u2019s inhabitants found they had run out of space to expand. To compensate, they began to build carefully on a rectangular street grid, and instead of spreading out, they built up, giving the world its first skyscrapers. The tallest of Shibam\u2019s mudbrick and cedarwood towers contains eight storeys and stands 30 metres high. High above the desert valley floor, Shibam is close to water sources but relatively safe from flooding. The shadows cast by the tall buildings provide lots of shade to the hot streets below and the fortified outer wall and high vantage point from the towers made it hard for rival tribes to attack. The city\u2019s 3,000 residents still largely follow the traditional living pattern, with in some cases up to 40 family members in the same tower. Animals and tools are kept on the ground floor and food is stored on the second. Elderly people live on the third and the fourth is used for entertaining. Higher levels are occupied by more nimble families, with childless newlyweds on the roof. Internal doors link up to 10 houses on a street block, although bridges from roof to roof that saved elderly legs from climbing up and down staircases have not survived. Today the streets are too narrow for cars, but Shibam is largely self-sustaining: its farmers and shopkeepers cater to the small population and many men are employed baking the straw and mud bricks used in construction. As in many Yemeni cities, goats and chickens roam the streets. \u201cLots of young people have left,\u201d said Ali Abdullah, 28, who was looking after his family\u2019s goats along with his 10-year-old brother, Majid. \u201cShibam is beautiful but there is no reliable money to make here unless they start preserving the buildings again.\u201d While their owners do what they can to rebuild crumbling walls and protect their homes from termites with limewash, Shibam\u2019s 444 buildings are vulnerable to wind, rain and heat erosion: the outer layers of clay need constant maintenance to stop the walls cracking and eventually collapsing. Since Yemen\u2019s Arab Spring revolt in 2011, funding to help preserve the city has dried up, as has the once steady flow of tourists, said Salim Rubiyah, the head of the local association responsible for looking after the public buildings inside Shibam\u2019s walls. Two towers have collapsed in the last few years, and at least 15 more are in urgent need of repair, according to the General Organisation for the Preservation of Historic Cities in Yemen. \u201cShibam is very special,\u201d said Rubiyah. \u201cI don\u2019t know why everyone doesn\u2019t build like this. I worry that this will be the last generation who are able to make a life here and appreciate the city\u2019s beauty.\u201d Elsewhere in Yemen, the story repeats itself.

It was the pot that landed her in \u201cDisney jail\u201d.

She approached the mainstream with the irreverence of the underground and, in her abstracted way, tackled grim social realities, writing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reSOp1domrU\">songs about Karen Carpenter</a> and body image, media misogyny and sexual harassment at Sonic Youth\u2019s record label.</p> <p>Gordon has long regarded herself more as a visual artist than a musician. \u201cPlaying bass was never my desire,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was a byproduct of wanting to make something exciting.\u201d At first, Sonic Youth were influenced by the brash extremities of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2012/mar/01/blank-city-new-york-no-wave-video\">no-wave</a> scene: \u201cIt was like a gauntlet was thrown down,\u201d Gordon says. \u201c\u2018Here, you try to make something.\u2019\u201d But in the male-dominated New York noise milieu, it was Gordon who made it seem as if anyone could pick that gauntlet up \u2013 that to be an artist you just have to begin. Her career has been an inspired testament to her own maxim that at concerts \u201cpeople pay to see others believe in themselves\u201d.</p> <p>Gordon and Moore\u2019s divorce spelled the end of Sonic Youth. Her raw 2015 memoir, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/12/girl-in-a-band-kim-gordon-review-autobiography-sonic-youth\">Girl in a Band</a>, aired the details of his infidelity and their difficult divorce. \u201cWhen I first found out Thurston had a double life, seeing the texts, I was about to go to yoga,\u201d she tells me. \u201cI was just looking at the time when I picked up his phone.\u201d Gordon still went to yoga.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0a05c449bcb5caab80eb62f307f8df9919e75955\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a05c449bcb5caab80eb62f307f8df9919e75955/0_0_3882_2329/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kim Gordon\u2019s artwork on display at the London Frieze art fair, 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kim Gordon\u2019s artwork on display at the London Frieze art fair, 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rune Hellestad/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She has since experienced a personal renaissance of sorts, joining 303 Gallery as an outlet for her visual art and formed the immersive improv duo Body/Head with <a href=\"https://www.cafeoto.co.uk/artists/bill-nace/\">Bill Nace</a>.

(Gordon later gives me one of Coco\u2019s poetry zines, which includes a beautiful piece dedicated to her mother: \u201cThere\u2019s a Crack in the Carpet \u2013 There\u2019s a Dream in My Chest.\u201d)<strong> </strong>Warm though still a bit elusive, at 66, Gordon says she is still not totally comfortable giving interviews to promote her work and talking about herself: \u201cAfter a while, you feel like an imposter.\u201d One of her paintings comes to mind: the dripping words <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artwork/kim-gordon-secret-abuse\" title=\"\">Secret Abuse</a>, Gordon\u2019s comment on artists\u2019 relationship to the commercial world. It reminds me of artists\u2019 relationships to themselves, too, and she agrees: \u201cThe process is torture.\u201d</p> <p>For her solo album, Gordon worked with an outside producer for the first time, <a href=\"http://www.aaminc.com/clients/detail/justin_raisen\">Justin Raisen</a>, an eccentric, new-age-y Angeleno who says he made a habit of regularly chanting Gordon\u2019s name in the weeks before the universe conspired to bring them together: he DM\u2019d her after his brother met her at a restaurant. Gordon felt that Raisen \u2013 who has worked with Sky Ferreira and Angel Olsen \u2013 understood her \u201ctrashy, dissonant\u201d sensibility. \u201cIt was pretty casual,\u201d she says. \u201cJustin just said: \u2018Bring over your fucked-up poetry and we\u2019ll make some shit.\u2019 He was calling me Kimye.\u201d</p> <p>Named after <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4881016/\">No Home Movie</a>, a film by Chantal Akerman, No Home Record powerfully makes the case for Gordon as an art concept herself, one who combusts notions of what music can be in order to obliquely expose the status quo. Her music feels more aligned with her visual art practice than ever \u2013 the lyrics of the vertigo-inducing Murdered Out mention matte-black spray. In her art and her music, her language is striking. She has recently painted hashtags \u2013 #Resist, #PussyGrabsBack, #YouDontOwnMe \u2013 and on No Home Record there is an abrasive anthem called Air BnB.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Jhhzy7vr8A\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_Jhhzy7vr8A?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just subject matter,\u201d she deflects, before adding: \u201cWhat is the modern-day landscape? What is a portrait now? I\u2019m fascinated by the pictures on Airbnb, these little utopias you can try on, to escape from one\u2019s objects and life.\u201d She mentions the influence of <a href=\"https://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/courbet-dossier/biography.html\">Courbet</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/feb/13/how-manet-changed-face-of-british-art\">Manet</a>, art depicting life happening. \u201cThe most interesting art to me is always kind of a critique of the culture,\u201d she says. \u201cTechnology gives us a false sense of confidence that everything is always evolving.\u201d</p> <p>When composing the lyrics for No Home Record, Gordon\u2019s friend, the poet <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/elaine-kahn\">Elaine Kahn</a>, prompted her to write down words from her everyday life. She often snatched phrases while driving around LA, looking at the signs in shopping malls. The title of the thundering closing track Get Yr Life Back was a phrase from a plastic sidewalk sandwich board promoting Get Your Life Back Yoga. \u201cEverything is branded now: Get Your Life Back, Be Here Now, these slogans,\u201d she says. In the album\u2019s skittering opener, Sketch Artist, the lyric \u201cdreaming in a tent\u201d refers to LA\u2019s homeless population. I ask if she is collaging reality. \u201cA little,\u201d she says, \u201cor curating.\u201d She suggests we drive around.</p> <p>Gordon grew up on the other side of the city, 45 minutes away, near the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where her father was a sociology professor. Her parents grew up during the great depression; Gordon says they never bought into consumer culture. She attended a laboratory school at UCLA that focused on learning-by-doing, which, Gordon says, \u201creally affected the process of how I make things\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I learned how to draw, I couldn\u2019t do it,\u201d she recalls, \u201cI would get stuck if I just thought of the pencil on the paper. So I thought of designing the page in lights and darks. You can get so paralysed in art making. I pretend I\u2019m doing something else.\u201d</p> <p>She drives us through MacArthur Park, past Otis College of Art and Design, where she studied in the mid-70s. Other landmarks along the way include a taco stand and her favourite carwash. \u201cDoes that say Barbie Spa?\u201d she asks at one point.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b664f4ba3d6cb9848dabdaddbd7a9310ab7a7a2f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b664f4ba3d6cb9848dabdaddbd7a9310ab7a7a2f/0_0_2424_3717/652.jpg\" alt=\"Kim Gordon performing with Sonic Youth in 1991.\" width=\"652\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gordon performing with Sonic Youth in 2001.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mick Hutson/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The songs on No Home Record are also about the consequences of convenience, the breakdown of communication in relationships and the breakdown of the world.

I ask if she ever had to fight for her ideas. \u201cThere\u2019s some unseen wall of faceless men that I have to climb over,\u201d she says, \u201cas if on a mission.\u201d</p> <p>When Gordon opens Get Yr Life Back with a statement about \u201cthe end of capitalism\u201d, she means that the system does not work: \u201cTrump is the ultimate capitalist, destroying everything,\u201d she says. Her wrenching conclusion \u2013 \u201cI feel bad for you / I feel bad for me\u201d \u2013 is both personal and political. \u201cPeople advocate forgiveness, which is a good thing, but the reality is different,\u201d Gordon says. \u201cYou have to look out for yourself.

      "bodyText": "Before she came to typify deadpan Downtown New York cool, Kim Gordon was a teenager in 1970s Los Angeles, smoking pot and listening to Joni Mitchell. It was the pot that landed her in \u201cDisney jail\u201d. Gordon and her friend were in a cave on pirate-themed Tom Sawyer\u2019s Island, lighting up a joint, when the Disney cops swooped in. \u201cThey took us underground,\u201d Gordon recalls \u2013 to a netherworld where she saw \u201cMickey Mouse with a walkie-talkie\u201d and endured creepy comments from the officers: \u201cDoes your mother know you\u2019re not wearing a bra?\u201d Gordon was left in a juvenile holding cell overnight. She was taking a political science class at the time, and her mind whirled. \u201cI was writing this paper in my head about Disneyland and how fascist it was,\u201d Gordon tells me. \u201cIt confirmed my beliefs about American consumerism.\u201d It\u2019s a belief she still holds. \u201cConsumerism is killing us,\u201d she says today. Kim Gordon v Disney is an unusually revealing punk-rock folk tale: from the earliest days of Sonic Youth, the band she co-founded with her ex-husband Thurston Moore, Gordon\u2019s music, art criticism and paintings have been a kind of post-Warhol skewering of American myths. That sceptical eye extends to her first solo album, No Home Record \u2013 a bold mix of industrial noise, art-punk poetics and wry wit, which I\u2019m discussing with Gordon at her sunny home in the quiet hills of LA\u2019s Los Feliz district. On display is a signed copy of Neil Young and Crazy Horse\u2019s Zuma; a poster for Jean-Luc Godard\u2019s Made in USA; and another of Darby Crash of the Germs, who are Gordon\u2019s favourite LA punk band because of their tendency to \u201cdeconstruct\u201d on stage unexpectedly. \u201cThat\u2019s my kind of entertainment.\u201d Books cover the coffee table: Claire Denis by Judith Mayne; Black Is a Color by Elvan Zabunyan; Fascination by Kevin Killian. \u201cI used to feel this existential nausea here,\u201d Gordon says of LA. \u201cNow it\u2019s a sigh of relief.\u201d On bass and guitar, Gordon was always what made Sonic Youth punk: the inspired reach of her speak-sung vocals, her declaration that \u201cwomen make natural anarchists\u201d, her decades-long suggestion that things you wouldn\u2019t expect can be art. She approached the mainstream with the irreverence of the underground and, in her abstracted way, tackled grim social realities, writing songs about Karen Carpenter and body image, media misogyny and sexual harassment at Sonic Youth\u2019s record label. Gordon has long regarded herself more as a visual artist than a musician. \u201cPlaying bass was never my desire,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was a byproduct of wanting to make something exciting.\u201d At first, Sonic Youth were influenced by the brash extremities of the no-wave scene: \u201cIt was like a gauntlet was thrown down,\u201d Gordon says. \u201c\u2018Here, you try to make something.\u2019\u201d But in the male-dominated New York noise milieu, it was Gordon who made it seem as if anyone could pick that gauntlet up \u2013 that to be an artist you just have to begin. Her career has been an inspired testament to her own maxim that at concerts \u201cpeople pay to see others believe in themselves\u201d. Gordon and Moore\u2019s divorce spelled the end of Sonic Youth. Her raw 2015 memoir, Girl in a Band, aired the details of his infidelity and their difficult divorce. \u201cWhen I first found out Thurston had a double life, seeing the texts, I was about to go to yoga,\u201d she tells me. \u201cI was just looking at the time when I picked up his phone.\u201d Gordon still went to yoga. She has since experienced a personal renaissance of sorts, joining 303 Gallery as an outlet for her visual art and formed the immersive improv duo Body/Head with Bill Nace. She is co-editing a book of writing about women in music and has been consulting for the television show Daisy Jones and the Six, based on the bestselling novel about a fictional 70s band a la Fleetwood Mac. \u201cI think they want to make it darker,\u201d she says, \u201cor that useless word, \u2018authentic\u2019.\u201d Gordon has lived in Los Feliz for three years, having moved from Massachusetts, where she and Moore raised their daughter, Coco, now 25. (Gordon later gives me one of Coco\u2019s poetry zines, which includes a beautiful piece dedicated to her mother: \u201cThere\u2019s a Crack in the Carpet \u2013 There\u2019s a Dream in My Chest.\u201d) Warm though still a bit elusive, at 66, Gordon says she is still not totally comfortable giving interviews to promote her work and talking about herself: \u201cAfter a while, you feel like an imposter.\u201d One of her paintings comes to mind: the dripping words Secret Abuse, Gordon\u2019s comment on artists\u2019 relationship to the commercial world. It reminds me of artists\u2019 relationships to themselves, too, and she agrees: \u201cThe process is torture.\u201d For her solo album, Gordon worked with an outside producer for the first time, Justin Raisen, an eccentric, new-age-y Angeleno who says he made a habit of regularly chanting Gordon\u2019s name in the weeks before the universe conspired to bring them together: he DM\u2019d her after his brother met her at a restaurant.

Her music feels more aligned with her visual art practice than ever \u2013 the lyrics of the vertigo-inducing Murdered Out mention matte-black spray.

What is a portrait now? I\u2019m fascinated by the pictures on Airbnb, these little utopias you can try on, to escape from one\u2019s objects and life.\u201d She mentions the influence of Courbet and Manet, art depicting life happening. \u201cThe most interesting art to me is always kind of a critique of the culture,\u201d she says. \u201cTechnology gives us a false sense of confidence that everything is always evolving.\u201d When composing the lyrics for No Home Record, Gordon\u2019s friend, the poet Elaine Kahn, prompted her to write down words from her everyday life. She often snatched phrases while driving around LA, looking at the signs in shopping malls. The title of the thundering closing track Get Yr Life Back was a phrase from a plastic sidewalk sandwich board promoting Get Your Life Back Yoga. \u201cEverything is branded now: Get Your Life Back, Be Here Now, these slogans,\u201d she says. In the album\u2019s skittering opener, Sketch Artist, the lyric \u201cdreaming in a tent\u201d refers to LA\u2019s homeless population. I ask if she is collaging reality. \u201cA little,\u201d she says, \u201cor curating.\u201d She suggests we drive around. Gordon grew up on the other side of the city, 45 minutes away, near the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where her father was a sociology professor.

So I thought of designing the page in lights and darks. You can get so paralysed in art making. I pretend I\u2019m doing something else.\u201d She drives us through MacArthur Park, past Otis College of Art and Design, where she studied in the mid-70s. Other landmarks along the way include a taco stand and her favourite carwash. \u201cDoes that say Barbie Spa?\u201d she asks at one point.

      "bodyText": "A Lloyd\u2019s of London insurer \u2013 considered one of the few remaining possible underwriters for elements of the Carmichael coal project \u2013 has distanced itself from Adani and says it is not involved in negotiations. Canopius was one of two global companies understood to have held discussions with a broker about insuring the construction of Adani\u2019s proposed rail line, linking the Carmichael mine site to the Queensland freight network. Both now appear to have ruled themselves out. It was reported on Thursday that Axis Capital withdrew its bid. Canopius said in a statement on Friday it was \u201cnot involved in any negotiations to provide insurance coverage for the Adani mine project\u201d. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear whether its reference to the \u201cmine project\u201d was intended to also refer to the construction of the rail line. Adani insists it has \u201cthe necessary insurance requirements in place, consistent with our construction activities\u201d. However, activist and investor groups have increasingly sought to provoke major insurers to withdraw, believing Adani\u2019s Indian management would be unlikely to continue to finance the mine without sufficient risk mitigation in place. Leaks solicited from an activist \u201cdob in Adani\u201d campaign revealed details about the latest insurance negotiations. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Prior to the statement by Canopius, 58 major companies, including 16 major insurance companies, had effectively ruled out dealings with Adani on the Carmichael project. The growing list leaves relatively few insurers with the capability to support Carmichael and will mean increased attention on those who have yet to make definitive statements. US-based financial giant AIG on Friday declined to comment on its position. The investor action group Market Forces says it understands Adani previously held policies with AIG that had been due to expire on 30 September. AIG did not comment on questions about whether these policies had been renewed or extended. Pressure on the company already has included protests at its Sydney and Melbourne offices, and calls for the world champion New Zealand rugby side to ditch AIG as a sponsor. Market Forces campaigner Pablo Brait said that Canopius \u201cneeds to urgently clarify\u201d its statement, and whether it would rule out insuring construction of Adani\u2019s rail line. \u201cAdani\u2019s options for insurance are rapidly shrinking for good reason,\u201d Brait said. \u201cNo insurance company that properly understands the climate crisis would go anywhere near a massive new coal project. \u201cNow the focus is on AIG and Lloyd\u2019s.

The state government\u2019s stance has prompted accusations it is deliberately erecting barriers to transparency and accessibility by making it harder for citizens to access official documents. In most jurisdictions, governments are compelled to accept FOI requests via email. But in NSW, the government has resisted calls that government agencies be forced to accept electronic lodgements through the state\u2019s Government Information (Public Access) Act scheme, known as Gipa. NSW law requires that requests be lodged \u201cin writing sent by post to or lodged at an office of the agency\u201d. It was not until last year that the law was amended to give government agencies the option to accept electronic requests for documents, if they so wished. Government agencies retained the right to require snail mail or in-person lodgement. NSW Department of Justice officials were questioned last month on why they had not fully embraced electronic requests by making it mandatory for agencies to accept them.

Prime minister Jacinda Ardern is making her way to Gisborne on the east coast of the North Island, to take part in government-funded events to commemorate Cook\u2019s landing in Poverty Bay. Earlier this week the British high commissioner Laura Clarke \u201cexpressed regret\u201d to local Iwi groups over the deaths of nine Indigenous people in the initial meetings between Cook and M\u0101ori, but stopped short of an apology. Her efforts were largely applauded by local Indigenous groups.

A flotilla of ships \u2013 including a replica of Cook\u2019s Endeavour \u2013 is scheduled to dock in Gisborne on Saturday, and will be greeted by Ardern.

In an extraordinary statement, Lewin said players had been told that unless they commit to the new deal they may not have the opportunity to play in 2020. Commit to the deal or else.</p> <p>In the middle of this sits the AFLPA. The association is the representative body for players, women and men. It claims players are \u201ckey stakeholders\u201d (they are) and thus \u201cdeserve to continue to have their voices heard on all issues pertaining to themselves and the game\u201d (they do).</p> <p>How well the voices of the women of the AFLW are heard, however, is suspect, given they are granted only one seat on the board of the AFLPA. Melbourne\u2019s Meg Downie has that spot. One spot for a rapidly growing and evolving competition with unique challenges seems inadequate at best and negligent at worst. Hopefully Downie has a loud voice.</p> <p>The space allocated to the AFLW on the AFLPA board is not unlike the space offered for the competition: narrow, limited in scope and out of step with what the competition and the women playing in it deserve.</p> <p>The association may claim they are dedicating ample resources to the women\u2019s game, but actions speak louder than words. From the outside looking in, the AFLPA has consistently failed to advocate in a manner that would match the dedication and commitment of the players. Their push for players to agree to the conditions of the new agreement despite their reservations and concerns suggests that they are more concerned with signing off on the deal and moving on than addressing the very real issues facing the women of the AFLW.</p> <p>Women\u2019s football champion, Susan Alberti, has suggested the AFLW needs its own association, one dedicated to them and their unique challenges. It\u2019s difficult to disagree when the organisation currently tasked with protecting the rights of the players seems more concerned with checking a box on their to-do list.</p> <p>Later this month, the AFLW draft will be held at the Melbourne Showgrounds. It should be an exciting day. One where long-held dreams, dreams once thought impossible, will come true. It should be a day of joy, a day that further cements the AFLW and its future. But without an agreement for the 2020 season, it may not be any of those things.</p> <p>For the future of the competition, the AFLW needs \u2013 and absolutely deserves \u2013 the support of an organisation with its best interests at heart. An organisation that understands the challenges of the women\u2019s game, but also the very real things that make it so special to so many people. An organisation that will fight for the competition, for the women who play in it and for the future it so richly deserves. As it stands, the AFLPA is not that organisation.</p>",

In an extraordinary statement, Lewin said players had been told that unless they commit to the new deal they may not have the opportunity to play in 2020. Commit to the deal or else. In the middle of this sits the AFLPA. The association is the representative body for players, women and men. It claims players are \u201ckey stakeholders\u201d (they are) and thus \u201cdeserve to continue to have their voices heard on all issues pertaining to themselves and the game\u201d (they do). How well the voices of the women of the AFLW are heard, however, is suspect, given they are granted only one seat on the board of the AFLPA. Melbourne\u2019s Meg Downie has that spot. One spot for a rapidly growing and evolving competition with unique challenges seems inadequate at best and negligent at worst. Hopefully Downie has a loud voice. The space allocated to the AFLW on the AFLPA board is not unlike the space offered for the competition: narrow, limited in scope and out of step with what the competition and the women playing in it deserve. The association may claim they are dedicating ample resources to the women\u2019s game, but actions speak louder than words. From the outside looking in, the AFLPA has consistently failed to advocate in a manner that would match the dedication and commitment of the players. Their push for players to agree to the conditions of the new agreement despite their reservations and concerns suggests that they are more concerned with signing off on the deal and moving on than addressing the very real issues facing the women of the AFLW. Women\u2019s football champion, Susan Alberti, has suggested the AFLW needs its own association, one dedicated to them and their unique challenges. It\u2019s difficult to disagree when the organisation currently tasked with protecting the rights of the players seems more concerned with checking a box on their to-do list. Later this month, the AFLW draft will be held at the Melbourne Showgrounds. It should be an exciting day. One where long-held dreams, dreams once thought impossible, will come true. It should be a day of joy, a day that further cements the AFLW and its future. But without an agreement for the 2020 season, it may not be any of those things. For the future of the competition, the AFLW needs \u2013 and absolutely deserves \u2013 the support of an organisation with its best interests at heart. An organisation that understands the challenges of the women\u2019s game, but also the very real things that make it so special to so many people. An organisation that will fight for the competition, for the women who play in it and for the future it so richly deserves. As it stands, the AFLPA is not that organisation.",

The missile, known as the DF-17, can in theory manoeuvre sharply at many times the speed of sound, making it extremely difficult to defend against. In August China and Russia accused the United States of stoking a new arms race by testing a cruise missile, just weeks after Washington withdrew from a cold-war era missile control treaty that would have barred the test launch. The ground-launched missile, a conventionally-configured version of the nuclear-capable Tomahawk cruise missile, hit its target after over 500 kilometres of flight during the test, the Pentagon said in a statement. Ground-launched versions of the missile had been removed from service decades ago, after the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty was signed by Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev in 1987. The treaty\u2019s ban on missiles with ranges between 500km and 5,500km aimed to reduce the ability of both countries to launch a nuclear strike at short notice. Russia\u2019s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, condemned the launch, but said Moscow was not looking to start a new arms race, and would not deploy any new missiles unless the US did first. Beijing also attacked the US, warning that the missile test could lead to \u201canother round of the arms race\u201d, and have a \u201cserious negative impact\u201d on international and regional security.\u201d Additional reporting by Lillian Yang.

The treasurer\u2019s response came after two serious cases of antisemitic bullying in Melbourne schools were revealed by the Australian Jewish News on Thursday. \u201cIf they [bullies] understood and comprehended the atrocities of the Holocaust, they would be as insulted as anybody, including me, about these recent attacks,\u201d he said. The parents of both students complained to the schools involved but were not satisfied with the response and the students later left the schools. The Victorian education minister, James Merlino, has ordered a review into the handling of the complaints and said he would meet with the parents of the students. \u201cI have asked for an immediate review into how both schools have handled these matters, to ensure they were dealt with appropriately.\u201d In the first case, a five-year-old was subjected to antisemitic bullying over the course of four months by five classmates in the school bathrooms. The bullying reportedly included being called \u201cJewish vermin\u201d, \u201cthe dirty Jew\u201d and a \u201cJewish cockroach\u201d. In the second incident a 12-year-old student was forced to kiss the feet of a Muslim child and subjected to beatings and harassment. His mother, who spoke to the Jewish News on the condition of anonymity, said her son was invited to the park for a football game by a classmate from Cheltenham Secondary College. When he arrived at the park he was forced to kiss the shoes of a Muslim child and the incident was filmed and posted on social media. The bullying continued for months with the student labelled with antisemitic slurs and assaulted at school. Dr Colin Rubenstein, the executive director of the Australia/Israel and Jewish Affairs Council, said schools had a responsibility to provide a safe and nurturing environment for students that was free from racism and bullying. \u201cIncidents of anti-Jewish bullying committed by, and directed at, schoolchildren must never be excused or tolerated,\u201d he said. \u201cSchools must not simply dismiss such alleged racist attacks as ordinary \u2018bullying\u2019.\u201d",

Damien Moyse, policy and research manager at Renew, a national, not-for-profit organisation that inspires, enables and advocates for people to live sustainably in their homes and communities, says: \u201cIt\u2019s pretty unlikely that in the next couple of decades anything is going to surpass solar for household generation.\u201d What will change, Moyse says, is the shape and material make-up of those homes, and the batteries they house, whether stationary, or the major components of battery electric vehicles (BEVs); US testing continues on using BEV batteries for home storage, hooking them into the home\u2019s system when the car is garaged. Either could allow your excess solar output to be stored, sold on, or rationed for future use - and minimise reliance on petrol, gas, or coal-fired power. \u201cElectricity offers much greater opportunity in terms of efficiency than combustion or fossil-based technology,\u201d Moyse says. Clean Energy Council (CEC) media manager Mark Bretherton says 2.1 million Australian households have installed solar PV systems. Australia has embraced rooftop solar so enthusiastically that it has the highest penetration of residential rooftop solar in the world, with more than 2.1 million Australian solar homes. Photograph: Benjamin Egerland/Getty Images. \u201cThere are a lot of government programs and a lot of enthusiasm \u2026 demand is at record levels,\u201d Bretherton says. \u201cPeople see it as a way of taking their own action to reduce power bills. It\u2019s also an opportunity for environmentally minded people to take their own action on climate change.\u201d The uptake of Solar PV and battery systems points to a growing trend of transitioning away from a fossil fuel-dependent future, and unlocking the potential of off-grid energy self-sufficiency in the process (it is important, however, that consumers research what is the right battery for their needs, and engage an accredited installer). An accredited installer will choose a system that is appropriate for your requirements and ensure it is installed to all relevant Australian standards. Photograph: Gary Gloss Photogrpahy/Gippsland Solar. Howlett - an early battery evangelist, now with three decades of research under his belt - puts the potential of a battery-powered future into perspective. \u201cI came to the conclusion in the early \u201990s that we needed better batteries in order to use energy effectively,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat drove me to it was hearing that only 20 or 30% of the electricity we generate, even by fossil fuel, actually gets to its destination. The rest is lost in transmission and heat. And batteries are the answer to that. Lithium-ion batteries can operate well into 90% efficiency and above.\u201d And those electric-prop planes? \u201cElectric planes have serious potential, but you\u2019ll probably never have a commercial large-scale aircraft that\u2019s electric powered,\u201d Howlett says. While battery-powered drones and light craft will have their uses, the electric Eden of our future will be more earthly paradise than airborne utopia. (Sun)beam me up.

The Oz\u2019s front page was roundly mocked for appearing to airbrush China\u2019s human rights record by allowing Chinese ambassador Cheng Jingye\u2019s claims to remain unchallenged.

UN experts and activists say at least 1 million ethnic Uighurs, and members of other largely Muslim minority groups, have been detained in camps in the vast western province. Packham said it wasn\u2019t relevant to his front page story because it had been covered elsewhere. Seven cuts The axe hit Seven West Media this week, taking out the 10-year-old Sunday Night program, dozens of staff, senior executives and \u2013 unexpectedly \u2013 the entire Melbourne television publicity team. Former Ten publicist Steph Bansemer-Brown was amazed that history had repeated itself. The Seven chief executive, James Warburton, wielded the axe at Ten 13 years ago when he was running the network. Paying a high price News Corp\u2019s legal team is going to be kept very busy in coming months. The Daily Telegraph and the Sunday Telegraph have been hit by a number of high profile law suits since being ordered in April to pay Geoffrey Rush $2.9m in damages after a series of articles accused the Oscar-winning actor of \u201cinappropriate behaviour\u201d towards a female actor. This week Macquarie Media\u2019s chief executive, Adam Lang, launched defamation proceedings against the Daily Telegraph and editor-at-large Matthew Benns. The Tele\u2019s exclusive story, which is still online, claimed the radio boss was known as the \u201csmiling assassin\u201d who had made \u201ca series of management bungles\u201d in his handling of high-profile stars Alan Jones, Ray Hadley and Chris Smith. Then there\u2019s former Silverchair frontman Daniel Johns, who is suing the Sunday Telegraph for alleging that the notorious Sydney brothel The Kastle had become his second home. Under the headline \u201cKing of the Kastle\u201d reporter Amy Harris, who has been named along with editor Mick Carroll in the suit, said Johns had spent up to 18 hours a day at the brothel the previous two weeks. A former Channel 7 sports reporter, Josh Massoud, is also suing News \u2013 along with a number of other outlets including Nine and Fox Sports Australia \u2013 over their coverage of his departure from the network. A 24-page feature in the Sunday Telegraph has also attracted a defamation suit from one of its subjects, former nightclub owner John Ibrahim\u2019s son Daniel Taylor. Taylor has launched defamation action against the paper for wrongly suggesting he was a mafia member. Troll attack Nine\u2019s NRL presenter Erin Molan cried on WSFM\u2019s Jonesy and Amanda show this week when she was asked about being the victim of trolling on social media. Trolls have targeted Molan over claims she is feuding with former Footy Show host Andrew Johns, a claim Nine has denied. The trolls blame Molan for Johns\u2019s absence from Nine\u2019s Friday night football commentary team. \u201cI think it\u2019s because you are so professional, you are so good at your job and I think men don\u2019t like you being good in what they still see as their world,\u201d co-host Amanda Keller said. \u201cI admire the pants off you ... I just think you are the most professional female and it\u2019s threatened everybody.\u201d Coles not a happy customer It was just a few weeks ago that Macquarie Media chairman Russell Tate wrote to advertisers to apologise for the disruption caused by Alan Jones\u2019 comments about Jacinda Ardern. \u201cAlan and I are happy to talk and meet with as many of our advertisers as possible over the next two months to hear your views on how we can best serve your business, but in the meantime, I would be very interested to hear any comments or thoughts which can help us do that,\u201d Tate said. But it\u2019s unlikely Jones will be meeting with Coles, arguably the biggest of the more than 100 advertisers who have withdrawn their business from 2GB. Infuriated by a letter Coles wrote to a listener about his Ardern comments, Jones released a five-minute tirade at the supermarket on Thursday. Jones exploded when he heard Coles told the listener they \u201cvalued diversity, respect and actively promotes the rights of team members and customers\u201d. The 78-year-old broadcaster called the supermarket \u201ccorporate hypocrites\u201d and threatened to ask his listeners to stop shopping at Coles. \u201cIs this the same mob who have been ripping off dairy farmers by screwing down the processor who then screwed down dairy farmers on the farm gate price,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIs this the same Coles?\u201d \u201cI will bet you if my listeners had a choice between the value systems I practise on many fronts and especially in relation to dairy farmers they\u2019d choose me everyday ahead of Cody at Coles customer care. \u201cMy advice to Coles is to get your own value system in order before passing judgment about other people but don\u2019t worry we can both play the same game. \u201cAnd good luck to you by the time I\u2019m finished.\u201d",

In the first criminal case against a big bank following last year\u2019s financial services royal commission, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission has accused the company of hiring a telemarketing firm, Aegon Insights, to cold-call customers and try to sell them a life insurance policy known as Simple Life. It is understood CommInsure is also accused of failing to take potential customers through the detailed product disclosure statement that sets out the benefits and costs of a financial product. The hawking laws aim to stop companies forcing useless, costly or inappropriate insurance or other financial products onto consumers, but the royal commission heard they were frequently flouted, with another insurer, Clearview, admitting to breaking them more than 300,000 times.

Counsel assisting the royal commission, Rowena Orr QC, said CommInsure may have also committed crimes by misleading customers about trauma insurance coverage of heart attacks.

      "body": "<p>Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds\u2019 18th album was casually announced, a week before its release, in answer to an online query from a fan on Cave\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theredhandfiles.com/\">Red Hand Files</a> website. That says a lot about how Nick Cave has transformed himself over the last 12 months. Previously an entertaining but guarded interviewee, he has, more or less, thrown himself open to the public. His website began with Cave posting the words \u201cYou can ask me anything\u201d online. He\u2019s subsequently answered dozens of fans\u2019 questions, from the trivial to the metaphysical, eloquently and at length.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jun/16/conversations-with-nick-cave-review-wales-millennium-centre\">His most recent tour</a> was effectively its live incarnation, based around an audience Q&amp;A, conducted without a moderator. Anyone who has attended an artist Q&amp;A where a particularly banzai fan has ended up in possession of the microphone knows what a bold high-wire act that is. The accidental death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/15/nick-cave-son-arthur-dies-brighton-chalk-cliff-fall\">his son Arthur</a> in 2015, he said, has led him to \u201csee people in a different way\u201d, giving him \u201ca deep feeling toward other people and an absolute understanding of their suffering\u201d.</p> <p>And yet, for all his new-found empathy and openness, some things about Nick Cave remain enigmatic. What, for example, are we supposed to make of Ghosteen\u2019s cover, a kitschy, fairytale landscape illustration that looks not unlike one of those leaflets Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses hand out at shopping centres? His description of the album is also pretty gnomic: the eight songs on the first album are \u201cthe children\u201d; the two lengthy tracks and spoken word piece on album two are \u201ctheir parents\u201d.</p> <p>Anyone seeking a more prosaic description of Ghosteen\u2019s contents might note that, sonically, it continues and extends the weightless, drifting style of its two predecessors. It\u2019s not entirely clear how Bad Seeds drummer Thomas Wydler passed his time in the studio, given that this time around, there are virtually no rhythms \u2013 with the more punishing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/apr/25/from-bad-seeds-to-bad-girl-warren-ellis-on-his-brutal-way-of-working\">Warren Ellis</a>\u2019s tape loops and electronics replaced by warm analogue synthesiser that gives proceedings a faintly proggy feel. Indeed, Ghosteen occasionally feels like an infinitely warmer, sweeter sibling of 2016\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/09/nick-cave-and-the-bad-seeds-skeleton-tree-first-listen-review-a-masterpiece-of-love-and-devastation\">Skeleton Tree</a>. While that album forced its most beautiful melodies to pick their way gingerly through minefields of explosive noise and eerie, discordant soundscapes - or to submit to Cave singing them in an alarmingly parched, numb voice \u2013 here they\u2019re bolstered by soft, pillowy harmonies and stately piano. Cave\u2019s voice, meanwhile, sounds rich. At an age when singers tend to start losing some of their range, his appears to be getting wider: it\u2019s hard to imagine <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jul/02/nick-cave-interview-jack-barron-rocks-backpages\">the twentysomething who snarled</a> and howled his way through Saint Huck or Your Funeral My Trial daring to attain the high notes he achieves on The Spinning Song.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b7de25e3594c83a492e484d1c7b982e356d65a2d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7de25e3594c83a492e484d1c7b982e356d65a2d/0_0_1000_1000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Artwork for Ghosteen by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Artwork for Ghosteen by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ghosteen Ltd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The result is perhaps the most straightforwardly beautiful set of songs that Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds have ever recorded, which fits with the album\u2019s lyrical themes. When you listen to Ghosteen, the \u201cchildren\u201d/ \u201cparents\u201d description makes sense. Cave has talked about how his son\u2019s death altered his work, how he found a way to \u201cwrite beyond the trauma \u2026 to propel [myself] beyond the personal into a state of wonder\u201d. And, despite the appearance of regular Cave themes \u2013 the first thing you hear is him invoking Vegas-era Elvis \u2013 Ghosteen appears to depict that process. For all the cinematic attractiveness of their arrangements and the title track\u2019s opening meditation on the beauty of the world, the long songs on album two seem darker in tone, filled with sleepless nights, departures and desperate fantasies of escape: \u201cI\u2019m waiting for peace to come,\u201d repeats one ambiguous line in Hollywood. The songs on album one, meanwhile, sound like the result of working through those emotions: lighter, calmer, concerned with empathy and faith.

      "bodyText": "Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds\u2019 18th album was casually announced, a week before its release, in answer to an online query from a fan on Cave\u2019s Red Hand Files website. That says a lot about how Nick Cave has transformed himself over the last 12 months. Previously an entertaining but guarded interviewee, he has, more or less, thrown himself open to the public. His website began with Cave posting the words \u201cYou can ask me anything\u201d online. He\u2019s subsequently answered dozens of fans\u2019 questions, from the trivial to the metaphysical, eloquently and at length. His most recent tour was effectively its live incarnation, based around an audience Q&amp;A, conducted without a moderator. Anyone who has attended an artist Q&amp;A where a particularly banzai fan has ended up in possession of the microphone knows what a bold high-wire act that is. The accidental death of his son Arthur in 2015, he said, has led him to \u201csee people in a different way\u201d, giving him \u201ca deep feeling toward other people and an absolute understanding of their suffering\u201d. And yet, for all his new-found empathy and openness, some things about Nick Cave remain enigmatic. What, for example, are we supposed to make of Ghosteen\u2019s cover, a kitschy, fairytale landscape illustration that looks not unlike one of those leaflets Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses hand out at shopping centres? His description of the album is also pretty gnomic: the eight songs on the first album are \u201cthe children\u201d; the two lengthy tracks and spoken word piece on album two are \u201ctheir parents\u201d. Anyone seeking a more prosaic description of Ghosteen\u2019s contents might note that, sonically, it continues and extends the weightless, drifting style of its two predecessors. It\u2019s not entirely clear how Bad Seeds drummer Thomas Wydler passed his time in the studio, given that this time around, there are virtually no rhythms \u2013 with the more punishing of Warren Ellis\u2019s tape loops and electronics replaced by warm analogue synthesiser that gives proceedings a faintly proggy feel. Indeed, Ghosteen occasionally feels like an infinitely warmer, sweeter sibling of 2016\u2019s Skeleton Tree. While that album forced its most beautiful melodies to pick their way gingerly through minefields of explosive noise and eerie, discordant soundscapes - or to submit to Cave singing them in an alarmingly parched, numb voice \u2013 here they\u2019re bolstered by soft, pillowy harmonies and stately piano. Cave\u2019s voice, meanwhile, sounds rich. At an age when singers tend to start losing some of their range, his appears to be getting wider: it\u2019s hard to imagine the twentysomething who snarled and howled his way through Saint Huck or Your Funeral My Trial daring to attain the high notes he achieves on The Spinning Song. The result is perhaps the most straightforwardly beautiful set of songs that Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds have ever recorded, which fits with the album\u2019s lyrical themes. When you listen to Ghosteen, the \u201cchildren\u201d/ \u201cparents\u201d description makes sense. Cave has talked about how his son\u2019s death altered his work, how he found a way to \u201cwrite beyond the trauma \u2026 to propel [myself] beyond the personal into a state of wonder\u201d. And, despite the appearance of regular Cave themes \u2013 the first thing you hear is him invoking Vegas-era Elvis \u2013 Ghosteen appears to depict that process. For all the cinematic attractiveness of their arrangements and the title track\u2019s opening meditation on the beauty of the world, the long songs on album two seem darker in tone, filled with sleepless nights, departures and desperate fantasies of escape: \u201cI\u2019m waiting for peace to come,\u201d repeats one ambiguous line in Hollywood. The songs on album one, meanwhile, sound like the result of working through those emotions: lighter, calmer, concerned with empathy and faith. You feel the shift most clearly on Sun Forest, in which Cave does his patented apocalyptic thing \u2013 screaming horses, burning trees, hanging bodies, Jesus mad with grief \u2013 before the lyric suddenly flips \u2013 \u201cthe past pulls away and the future begins and I say goodbye to all that, / and the future rolls in like a wave\u2026 and the past, with its savage undertow, lets go\u201d \u2013 and ends up exhorting the listener: \u201cCome on, everyone!\u201d Most listeners seemed to take Skeleton Tree as an extended treatise on grief, ignoring Cave\u2019s insistence that the songs predated the loss they were presumed to be about. In fairness, you could see why, given how bleak and disturbing it sounded. But if Ghosteen is the album people supposed its predecessor to be, it sounds like nothing like you might expect of an album informed by tragedy. On one level, it shouldn\u2019t be surprising that it\u2019s as good as it is: Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds have been in a career-high purple patch since the last double album they released, 2004\u2019s Abattoir Blues/The Lyre of Orpheus. Nevertheless, listening to Ghosteen, it\u2019s very hard indeed not to be taken aback. \u2022 This review previously misstated the year of the death of Cave\u2019s son. This has been corrected.",

Elizabeth Warren, who by then had started rising in the polls, according to two people familiar with the discussion.

progressed.</em></p> \n   <p><em>The White House record of that call was later stored in the highly secured electronic system used to house a now-infamous phone call with Ukraine\u2019s President and

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump publicly called for China to investigate Joe Biden. He reportedly also discussed his leading political rivals in a June phone call with the Chinese president during which he suggested he\u2019d refrain from commenting on the Hong Kong protests so long as US-China trade talks progressed. Former Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker testified before lawmakers today. He and another US diplomat reportedly drafted a statement for the Ukrainian leader, pushing him to publicly commit to investigating Biden. A whistleblower from within the Internal Revenue Service reportedly filed a complaint regarding either the president or the vice president\u2019s tax returns. Trump and his supporters have tried to argue that the House democrats\u2019 impeachment investigations aren\u2019t valid because they haven\u2019t formally voted on opening an inquiry. House leader Nancy Pelosi responded that there is no constitutional requirement to hold such a vote. Joe Biden is trailing 2020 rivals Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg in third-quarter fundraising. Elizabeth Warren has yet to release her fundraising numbers. Sanders has yet to return to the campaign trail after undergoing a procedure for a blocked artery, but it seems he will attend the upcoming debate on Oct. 15. Energy secretary Rick Perry is expected to resign Perry, whose contacts in Ukraine have pulled him into the Trump-Ukraine impeachment inquiry, is planning to resign next month, Politico reports. Earlier this week he indicated that he would cooperate with House democrats investigations. In May, Perry attended Ukrainian leader Vlodomyr Zelenskiy\u2019s inauguration in lieu of vice-president Mike Pence after Pence canceled his planned trip, according to the whistleblower complaint that raised concerns over Trump\u2019s communications with Ukraine. Perry has largely avoided controversy as energy secretary, though his conduct has drawn some criticism. The former Texas governor and former Dancing with the Stars participant as energy secretary suggested that fossil fuels can help prevent sexual assault. The White House is planning to send Nancy Pelosi a letter arguing that Trump and his team don\u2019t have to comply with the impeachment inquiry Echoing the argument that House minority leader Kevin McCarthy made earlier today, the White House plans to inform House speaker Nancy Pelosi that Donald Trump and his team don\u2019t have to cooperate with the impeachment investigation until congress votes to formally approve the inquiry. Axios has the news from two sources familiar with the letter. In response to McCarthy, Pelosi said that there is no constitutional requirement to vote on opening an impeachment inquiry. Pelosi and House intelligence committee chair Adam Schiff have also warned that officials who do not cooperate with their investigation could be charged with obstructing justice. Trump envoys reportedly pushed Ukraine to publicly back investigations Another bit of late-breaking news from the New York Times. Two Trump administration diplomats, including Kurt Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine who was questioned by House investigators earlier today, reportedly drafted a statement for Volodymyr Zelenskiy that would have committed the Ukrainian leader to investigating Trump\u2019s political rivals. The statement would have committed Ukraine to investigating the energy company Burisma, which had employed Hunter Biden, the younger son of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. And it would have called for the Ukrainian government to look into what Mr. Trump and his allies believe was interference by Ukrainians in the 2016 election in the United States to benefit Hillary Clinton. The idea behind the statement was to break the Ukrainians of their habit of promising American diplomats and leaders behind closed doors that they would look into matters and never follow through. It is unclear if the statement was delivered to Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, but no statement was released publicly under his name. Around that time, the Ukrainian officials indicated to the Americans that they wanted to avoid becoming more deeply enmeshed in American politics. Trump reportedly discussed Biden and Warren with Chinese president Xi When Donald Trump suggested today, at a press conference, that China should investigate Joe Biden he said he\u2019d never actually pushed Chinese leader Xi Jinping to investigate his political rivals. Now CNN reports that Trump discussed Biden and Elizabeth Warren with Xi during a whole call. He also reportedly told Xi he\u2019d keep quiet about the protests in Hong Kong, so long as trade talks between China and the US progressed: During a phone call with Xi on June 18, Trump raised Biden\u2019s political prospects as well as those of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who by then had started rising in the polls, according to two people familiar with the discussion. In that call, Trump also told Xi he would remain quiet on Hong Kong protestsas trade talks progressed. The White House record of that call was later stored in the highly secured electronic system used to house a now-infamous phone call with Ukraine\u2019s President and which helped spark a whistleblower complaint that\u2019s led Democrats to open an impeachment inquiry into Trump.On Thursday, Trump told reporters at the White House he\u2019d consider asking his counterpart in Beijing to investigate the Bidens, adding to a growing list of foreign leaders he\u2019s tried to enlist in his attempts to bring down a potential Democratic challenger. Though it\u2019s unclear whether Trump actually asked Xi to investigate his rivals, it seems he was willing to trade favors \u2014 and look the other way while China violently quashes protests in Hong Kong, so long as Xi continued to negotiate on trade. The Guardian has not independently verified CNN\u2019s reporting. Given the revelations from CNN, however, it\u2019s worth noting that Trump has kept mostly quiet on Hong Kong. Even amidst mounting violence in Hong Kong this week, Trump offered only a message of congratulations to Xi, tweeting: \u201cCongratulations to President Xi and the Chinese people on the 70th Anniversary of the People\u2019s Republic of China!\u201d Earlier today senator Warren published an op-ed in Foreign Policy, urging Washington to stand up for the protesters. California congressman Devin Nunes has filed yet another lawsuit -- this time against Hearst magazine. The litigious republican lawmaker filed a $77.5m lawsuit in federal court against the publisher of Esquire magazine and the former reporter Ryan Lizza, alleging that a story from September 2018 about Nunes\u2019 family dairy farm caused \u201cinjury to his good name and professional reputation\u201d. Last year, Nunes sued the publishers of The Fresno Bee claiming that one of the paper\u2019s stories was a \u201ccharacter assassination\u201d and in March he sued Twitter and a handful of users \u2013 including those behind the parody accounts \u201cDevin Nunes\u2019 Mom\u201d and \u201cDevin Nunes\u2019 Cow\u201d. Lizza\u2019s Esquire story \u201cDevin Nunes\u2019s Family Farm Is Hiding a Politically Explosive Secret\u201d focused on members of Nunes\u2019 family who lived in Iowa and operated a dairy farm there even as the congressman promoted his deep roots in California. More from Kurt Volker\u2019s testimony Former special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker told lawmakers that he wasn\u2019t personally involved in Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukrainian leaders to investigate Joe Biden. Volker, who testified in the House this morning, reportedly warned Ukrainian officials to steer clear of American politics, according to the Associated Press: Volker, who has become a central figure in the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry, spent hours behind closed doors as lawmakers and staff pored through dozens of pages of text messages, photos and other correspondence during the interview, according to those familiar with the meeting. Volker resigned on Friday after being asked to testify to Congress about the whistleblower complaint that describes how Trump, in a July 25 phone call , repeatedly prodded Zelenskiy for an investigation of Biden and his son Hunter, while his administration delayed the release of military aid to help Ukraine fight Russia-backed separatists. The complaint says Volker met in Kyiv with Zelenskiy and other Ukrainian political figures a day after the call, and he provided advice about how to \u201cnavigate\u201d Trump\u2019s demands. ...The former envoy was in office as the administration was holding back $250 million for Ukraine at the time Trump was pressing Zelenskiy about the Bidens. Volker told the House investigators it was unusual for the U.S. to withhold aid to Ukraine, but said he was given no explanation for it, the person said. Republican lawmakers who took part in the interview with Volker downplayed what they heard. \u201cNot one thing he has said comports with any of the Democrats\u2019 impeachment narrative, not one thing,\u201d said Republican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio. Biden raised $15m during the third quarter of this year, lagging behind Bernie Sanders (who raised $25m) and Pete Buttigieg (who raised $19.1m). Bloomberg has more details here. Elizabeth Warren has yet to release her third-quarter fundraising. Biden held five private fundraisers in California last week. Warren subtweets right-wing conspiracy theorists and promotes student debt forgiveness plan all in one go Right-wing conspiracy theorist Jacob Wohl tried and spectacularly failed to smear 2020 front-runner Elizabeth Warren by claiming he had evidence that she had carried on a \u201clong-term sexual relationship\u201d with a 24-year-old bodybuilder marine. Wohl and his frequent collaborator, conservative lobbyist Jack Burkman, hosted a press conference at Burkman\u2019s Arlington, Virginia townhouse to promote this highly implausible scandal. They even printed up a special sign for the occasion: The duo \u2014 which previously failed to smear Robert Mueller and Ilhan Omar with other highly implausible sex scandals \u2014 even organized snacks: Though they failed to create a playlist to suit the occasion, a heckler reportedly remedied the situation - with Chumbawumba. It was good fun for the neighbors and tourists. But Elizabeth Warren appears to have had the last laugh. Nancy Pelosi brushes off request from minority leader to suspend impeachment inquiry In response to House minority leader Kevin McCarthy\u2019s request to suspend the impeachment inquiry until \u201crules and procedures are established\u201d, House leader Nancy Pelosi responded that \u201cthere is no requirement under the Constitution, under House Rules, or House precedent that the whole House vote before proceeding with an impeachment inquiry.\u201d Pelosi continued that she received McCarthy\u2019s request \u201cthis morning shortly after the world witnessed President Trump on national television asking yet another foreign power to interfere in the upcoming 2020 elections. We hope you and other Republicans share our commitment to following the facts, upholding the Constitution, protecting our national security, and defending the integrity of our elections at such a serious moment in our nation\u2019s history.\u201d Our west coast colleague Maanvi Singh will take over coverage for the next few hours, and there are still a lot of news developments to come. Earlier: \u2022Donald Trump has called for China to investigate his leading political rival, even as the president is the subject of impeachment proceedings for pressuring Ukraine to do the same. \u2022In a press conference outside the White House, Trump said: \u201cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened in Ukraine\u201d. \u2022The president then suggested he may specifically ask President Xi of China to begin an investigation into Joe and Hunter Biden. In the same press conference he again implored Ukraine to investigate his potential 2020 rival. \u2022Adam Schiff, the House intelligence committee chair, described Trump\u2019s comments as \u201crepugnant\u201d. Schiff said Trump\u2019s requests to China and Ukraine: \u201cIs an illustration that if this president has learned anything from the two years of the Mueller investigation is that he feels he can do anything with impunity.\u201d Hard on the heels of the Trump-Ukraine scandal, broken in to the open by an intelligence community whistleblower complaint, comes more breaking news this afternoon that an Internal Revenue Service official has filed a whistleblower complaint relating to either the president or the vice president\u2019s tax returns, the Washington Post reports. The complainant reportedly says he was told that at least one political appointee in the Treasury Department tried to interfere with the annual audit of Donald Trump or Mike Pence\u2019s tax returns. The Post attributes this to \u201cmultiple people familiar with the document\u201d and adds that the complaint was revealed in a court filing several months ago, but details have been clouded. The report comes amid heightened tension between the treasury department and House Democrats over Trump\u2019s tax returns, which have never been released, and the integrity of the annual audit of his and Pence\u2019s tax returns, which is supposed to be sealed off from any partisan involvement. Kurt Volker, the former US special envoy for the Ukraine, says he warned Rudy Giuliani that information Giuliani was receiving on Joe and Hunter Biden, from Ukraine, was false, according to the Washington Post. Volker gave testimony in the House this morning. According to the Post, Volker told House investigators that he had \u201ctried to caution Guiliani that his sources, including Ukraine\u2019s former top prosecutor, were unreliable and that he should be careful about putting faith in the prosecutor\u2019s stories, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the closed door meeting\u201d. From the Post: The former US special envoy for Ukraine told House investigators on Thursday that he warned President Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Rudolph W. Giuliani, that Giuliani was receiving untrustworthy information from Ukrainian political figures about former vice president Joe Biden and his son, according to two people familiar with his testimony. [...] Volker was named in the whistleblower complaint as the diplomat who set up a meeting between Giuliani and a top adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky amid Trump\u2019s effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. A tweet: More from Adam Schiff, who has continued to criticize Trump\u2019s earlier exhortation for China to investigate Biden: \u201cOnce again, having the president of the United States suggesting, urging, a foreign country to interfere in our presidential elections is an illustration that if this president has learned anything from the two years of the Mueller investigation is that he feels he can do anything with impunity.\u201d Trump suggests the \u201cpharmaceutical\u201d industry, and other industries, could be behind what he describes as a \u201choax\u201d. I\u2019m not sure which of the things Trump believes to be a hoax he is discussing, but it\u2019s likely the Mueller investigation or the Ukraine scandal. Trump then sits down and signs his Medicare bill. Then he hands out some pens to people standing around him. He leaves the stage to the Rolling Stones\u2019 You Can\u2019t Always Get What You Want. (The band have repeatedly asked him not to use their music.) A brief riff from Trump just now, floating a venture into the media business... Vice-president Mike Pence appears to have fallen in line with Trump. Pence has spent this afternoon defending Trump\u2019s pressuring of Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden. In particular, Pence said: \u201cThe American people have a right to know if the vice president of the United States, or his family, profited from his position.\u201d Interesting. Trump says Republicans will never allow health insurance companies to turn away those with pre-existing conditions. (It was Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act that stopped health insurance companies being able to refuse treatment to those with pre-existing conditions. Most Republicans voted against it.) Trump is discussing some of his legislative achievements. Of his agenda, and vision for the country, Trump invokes botany: \u201cIt\u2019s like a plant. It\u2019s like a tree. Those roots have to grab hold [...] That thing has to grow and it has to get in there and then nobody\u2019s gong to be able to take it down later on.\u201d Trump touts waiting times compared to the UK and Canada. Just as an aside: the US spends \u201cabout twice what other high-income nations do on health care\u201d, with significantly worse results. Check out this report from Reuters last year. Trump is running through some of his talking points about Democrats and healthcare. The majority of Democrats running for president \u2013 according to Trump \u2013 will \u201cslash Medicare\u201d to \u201cpay for socialism\u201d. Oh, and Democrats would also drain Medicare to pay for \u201copen borders\u201d, Trump says. Trump is now mis-characterizing the idea of universal healthcare. He goes on to call Elizabeth Warren \u201cPocahontas\u201d, which is a racist slur, and riffs briefly about \u201cSleepy Joe\u201d. \u201cDemocrat lawmakers only want to wreck and destroy all the things we\u2019ve built up over the last three years,\u201d Trump says. If a Democrat gets in, \u201cthe country is gonna go to hell\u201d, Trump says. Then he brings up Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation hearing. Trump is speaking in Florida at a healthcare rally. The president is expected to sign an executive order this afternoon that, Trump says, will protect medicare. Trump claims his administration is aiming to deliver the best quality healthcare system in the world. We\u2019ll have to wait and see if Trump wades back into the Ukraine scandal. He roped China into the whole saga earlier. House intelligence committee chair Adam Schiff is less than impressed with Trump\u2019s request that China also investigate Joe Biden... from Politico reporter Andrew Desiderio: I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll hear more from Schiff before the day is out. Here\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s main story on Trump\u2019s remarkable calls for China \u2013 as well as Ukraine \u2013 to investigate his political rival Joe Biden. Washington Post political reporter Sean Sullivan reports that Bernie Sanders will appear at the next Democratic presidential debate: Sanders\u2019 campaign had been silent as to when, or whether, he would return to the campaign trail. He canceled events this week after undergoing heart surgery on Tuesday. The Vermont senator had a blockage in an artery, and required two stents to be inserted. Some reaction from House intelligence committee chair Adam Schiff to Trump\u2019s Ukraine-China debacle this morning: George Conway, husband of Trump\u2019s adviser Kellyanne Conway and a persistent thorn in the president\u2019s side, has resumed his criticism of the president in an article for the Atlantic. Conway, an attorney, has been asking questions about Trump\u2019s mental state throughout Trump\u2019s presidency. Now, Conway reckons, there has been \u201ca recent escalation in Trump\u2019s bizarre behavior, as the pressures of his upcoming reelection campaign, a possibly deteriorating economy, and now a full-blown impeachment inquiry have mounted\u201d. You don\u2019t need to be a weatherman to know which way the wind blows, and you don\u2019t need to be a mental-health professional to see that something\u2019s very seriously off with Trump\u2014particularly after nearly three years of watching his erratic and abnormal behavior in the White House. A former US special envoy for Ukraine is testifying before three House committees today \u2013 the first official to testify over the Trump-Ukraine scandal. Kurt Volker is giving testimony to the Intelligence, Oversight and Reform and Foreign Affairs committees. The hearings are behind closed doors. My colleague Julian Borger profiled Volker this week: When Kurt Volker agreed to work for the Trump administration in 2017, he told colleagues he hoped to navigate the president\u2019s mercurial nature and his evident attachment to Vladimir Putin, and still pursue a traditional US policy of upholding Ukrainian independence and pushing back against Moscow. We\u2019ll bring more if news leaks out from the hearing. Andrew Yang, the tech entrepreneur running an outsider bid for president, raised $10m in the third quarter of 2019, according to his campaign. Campaign merchandise accounted for about $2.4m of the total, Yang\u2019s campaign said, including the sale of more than 20,000 \u2018MATH\u2019 hats. \u201cThis grassroots fund-raising total, with more than $6 million in the bank, ensures this campaign will have the funding to compete and outperform expectations through Super Tuesday and beyond,\u201d Yang\u2019s campaign said. Yang is only averaging 3.5% in national polls, but has met the requirements for the fourth Democratic presidential debate, which will be held on October 15. CNN has refused to air a Trump campaign advert which pushes false claims about the Bidens actions in Ukraine, according to the Daily Beast: The 30-second ad, titled \u201cBiden Corruption,\u201d peddles misleading accusations about Joe Biden and his son Hunter in an attempt by President Trump to deflect from controversy over his pressuring of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to dig up dirt on the former vice president. \u201cJoe Biden promised Ukraine $1 billion if they fired the prosecutor investigating his son\u2019s company,\u201d the cinematic trailer-like narrator blares. \u201cBut when President Trump asks Ukraine to investigate corruption, the Democrats want to impeach him,\u201d the ad continues over footage of House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA). In fact, multiple countries wanted the prosecutor Trump mentions to be fired. And the investigation into the company where Hunter Biden worked was dormant when the prosecutor was fired. Donald Trump has called for Ukraine and China to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, even as Trump is the subject of an impeachment inquiry for... pushing Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. In an extraordinary press conference outside the White House \u2013 aired on cable news and attended by multiple journalists \u2013 Trump said China should investigate the Bidens, and suggested he may ask the country to do so. Trump also said the Ukraine government should start a \u201cmajor investigation\u201d into the Bidens, \u201cif they were honest about it\u201d. As a reminder: there is no evidence that Joe or Hunter Biden did anything wrong in Ukraine. Or in China. Trump was asked what he thought Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy \u2013 who Trump was recorded pressuring to investigate the Bidens \u2013 should do. \u201cIf they were honest about it, they would start a major investigation into the Bidens,\u201d Trump said when asked what he wanted Ukrainepresident Volodymyr Zelensky to do. \u201cI would say President Zelenskiy, if it was me, I would start an investigation into the Bidens.\u201d Trump then discussed his trade war with China, before adding: \u201cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened in Ukraine.\u201d Trump did not explain what he meant by \u201cwhat happened in China\u201d. Again: there is no evidence of any wrongdoing by the Bidens. Trump was then asked if he had requested President Xi of China to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden. \u201cI haven\u2019t but it\u2019s certainly something we can start thinking about,\u201d Trump said. Donald Trump\u2019s remarks just now were extraordinary. Trump, currently under investigation for urging Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, again encouraged Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden. On live tv. Not only that, the president then urged China to investigate Biden. Some context: Trump continues talking about Ukraine, making false statements about how the country got rid of its prosecutor. Of the whistleblower complaint, Trump says: \u201cIt\u2019s totally inaccurate because the conversation that I had was absolutely perfect.\u201d Trump says he is meeting with China next week and will discuss trade. \u201cI have a lot of options on China but if they don\u2019t do what we want we have tremendous power,\u201d Trump says. Then he pivots to the Bidens, making unfounded and context-free claims about wrongdoing in China: \u201cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened in Ukraine.\u201d Donald Trump, speaking outside the White House, said Ukraine should investigate his rival Joe Biden \u2013 exactly the thing Trump is under threat of impeachment for \u2013 and added that China should also start a probe. \u201cIf they were honest about it, they would start a major investigation into the Bidens,\u201d Trump said when asked what he wanted Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy to do. \u201cI would say President Zelenskiy, if it was me, I would start an investigation into the Bidens.\u201d Trump said China should also start an investigation into the Bidens, and suggested he might ask the country to do so. Asked if he had requested President Xi of China to help investigate the Bidens, POTUS replied: \u201cI haven\u2019t but it\u2019s certainly something we can start thinking about.\u201d On Tuesday we learned about Donald Trump\u2019s plans to construct a Moot moat along the US-Mexico border and fill it with snakes and alligators. That was according to a report from the New York Times, which has now been confirmed by the Washington Post. According to the Post, Trump also suggested arming US forces \u201cwith bayonets to block people from crossing into the United States across the Mexico border\u201d. The Times had reported that Trump additionally proposed shooting would-be migrants in the legs, so as to prevent them crossing into the US, and wanted his as-yet unbuilt border wall to be electrified, with spikes on top. Trump has denied the reporting. Some bad news for Kamala Harris this morning: the California senator is drooping in the polls in her home state. Harris is the choice of just 8% of Californians, according to a survey by the Public Policy Institute of California. That puts her in fourth place, way behind Elizabeth Warren (23%), Joe Biden (22%) and Bernie Sanders (21%). It\u2019s not looking good for Harris nationally, either. Real Clear Politics\u2019 polling average shows her on just 4.8%. So what\u2019s Donald Trump up to this morning? WELL, he\u2019s been attacking Adam Schiff \u2013 a \u201clowlife\u201d and a \u201clying disaster \u2013 and also having a go at 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg. Lovely. Trump is heading to Florida at 10am. He is expected to speak about his health-care agenda, such as it is, and could address the Ukraine scandal on his way to the airport. Storm clouds are continuing to gather around Donald Trump over the Ukraine scandal, but that hasn\u2019t stopped his faithful confidante, Lindsay Graham, from reportedly urging foreign governments to work with William Barr in investigating the origins of the Mueller inquiry. Graham is said to have written to the prime ministers of Australia, Italy and the UK to request their \u201ccontinued cooperation with attorney general Barr as the Department of Justice continues to investigate the origins and extent of foreign influence in the 2016 election\u201d. The investigation is an attempt to discredit Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential election. A GOP tactic as 2020 looms is to claim the entire investigation was flawed. According to numerous reports, in the letter Graham wrote that US intelligence agencies used a \u201cdeeply flawed dossier filled with hearsay and written by a biased, former United Kingdom intelligence officer\u201d as part of the Mueller inquiry. Elsewhere this morning: \u2022Donald Trump has been tweeting since 6am. It\u2019s the usual stuff: the US is being ripped off, Adam Schiff=bad, the Bidens are corrupt, etc etc. \u2022Joe Biden is ramping up his investment in key Super Tuesday states, Politico reports \u2013 trying to develop a firewall if the former-vice president doesn\u2019t do so well in Iowa and New Hampshire. \u2022A number of foreign companies are reconsidering plans to invest in the US because of Trump\u2019s trade war with China, according to Axios.",

He has been actively working for solutions to ecological destruction for decades, leading whole communities towards action, while being ignored by the vast majority. Some of the responses to his declaration, suggesting his approach has been an individualist one ignoring the need for collective action, are ignorant of his work.

In this way, he has driven vital shifts in building regulations, and more important shifts in understandings of how we humans can and should live as part of the natural world rather than trying to separate ourselves from it. Ecological thinking teaches us that all collective action is made up of interwoven and interlinked individual action. As Greta Thunberg says: \u201cWe need system change rather than individual change, but you can\u2019t have one without the other.\u201d Which brings us to why talking of literally burning bridges is not helpful. If we\u2019re to survive in the far-less-hospitable world that two centuries of institutionalised greed, selfishness and short-sightedness have bequeathed us, it will only be together. It will only be by using the coming years to cultivate resilient, cohesive, cooperative, equitable communities, embedded in the natural world. That\u2019s why, while Mobbs is of course entitled to choose to retire with our thanks for what he\u2019s achieved, the criticism of his public declaration of survivalism as embedded in a culture of white supremacy and the right of wealth is also entirely legitimate.

This is why the focus of the responses to Mobbs\u2019 declaration from the left, in particular Amy Gray\u2019s searing critique, attack it as inequitable and racist. My addendum is that just as survivalism makes extinction more likely by cutting off the option of action, dividing our society even further makes societal collapse even more likely. This would be the worst outcome of all. At this point in history, now that we have locked in ecological disruption on a scale our species has never known, we must learn the lessons of ecology. And the number one lesson is that resilience is the key. Resilience, not dominance, is the real strength, especially in hard times. And the secret to resilience is connected diversity, cohesion, cooperative coexistence. That means that in many ways our most important task right now is to build social cohesion while learning to live within natural limits. Luckily, there are ways of making sure that the two go hand in hand. Whether it\u2019s urban community agriculture or local sharing and repair groups; whether it\u2019s models of participatory democracy like Voices for Indi or community renewable energy cooperatives; whether it\u2019s stripping corporations of the rights of legal personhood unless they properly respect social and environmental norms, supporting worker- and user-owned cooperatives to compete with them, or prioritising the long-term interests of traditional owners and workers over the profits of fossil fuel corporations; all these point the way towards holding off the worst ecological impacts of climate disruption while building the resilience to avoid the societal collapse it could trigger. If, at this moment, we turn even more against each other, we have no future. The strongest will survive for a while. Then they, too, will be lost. In reality, Michael Mobbs\u2019 solution of urban living in harmony with the natural world, brought together with deep democracy and cultivating social cohesion, is the only path to survival. \u2022 Tim Hollo is executive director of the Green Institute",

The treasurer and deputy Liberal leader made the comments on Friday, following Morrison\u2019s speech to the Lowy Institute in which he declared sovereign nations needed to eschew an \u201cunaccountable internationalist bureaucracy\u201d and the world needs to avoid \u201cnegative globalism\u201d. A week after Trump used a speech to the United Nations to declare the future belonged to patriots, not globalists, Morrison echoed the American president\u2019s nationalist tone, telling the foreign policy thinktank on Thursday that \u201conly a national government, especially one accountable through the ballot box and the rule of law, can define its national interests\u201d. Frydenberg said the prime minister was arguing that global institutions must \u201cwork for all countries, not just some\u201d. \u201cWe want these global institutions not to berate countries but to work effectively with them,\u201d he told Radio National. Asked what \u201cinternational bureaucracy\u201d Australia disapproves of, Frydenberg cited \u201cthe human rights organisation within the UN\u201d for \u201csingling out [Australia] more than North Korea or Iran\u201d during the Howard government era. \u201cNow, they were doing that at the time because of our border protection policies \u2026 that have been admired by other countries around the world for their effectiveness, ensuring that authorised arrivals come to Australia and lives are not lost at sea \u2013 so that\u2019s a good example.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Australia runs offshore detention facilities on Manus Island and Nauru designed to deter people from coming to Australia by boat to claim asylum, and turns back boats at sea, a practice the UN has said is illegal under international law and \u201cmay intentionally put lives at risk\u201d. Although offshore detention centres were reopened in the dying days of the Labor government in 2013 and turnbacks introduced by the Abbott Coalition government thereafter, the bipartisan consensus for harsh refugee policies can be traced back to the Howard government because John Howard won the 2001 election in part because he refused to accept asylum seekers rescued by the Norwegian tanker MV Tampa. Frydenberg rejected the claim Australia only approves of international institutions when they agree with Australian policies, countering that \u201cit\u2019s about getting the balance right and sometimes they don\u2019t\u201d. He defended Australia\u2019s record as a \u201cgood global citizen \u2013 being a founding member of the UN and pulling more than our weight in our region, for example in East Timor and the Solomons and other places\u201d. Frydenberg rejected the suggestion Australia is echoing Trump\u2019s rhetoric on globalism. \u201cAustralia will chart its own course \u2026 We act on behalf of 25 million Australians,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do disagree with the Americans on a number of issues, not least of all the current trade tensions.\u201d Frydenberg said Australia recognises the US has raised some \u201clegitimate issues\u201d but wants it to reach an agreement with China to end tit-for-tat tariff increases and add to global growth. \u201c[Morrison] was also making a broader point about the need for Australia to chart a practical path forward globally and that means engaging with our key partners,\u201d Frydenberg said, citing the prime minister\u2019s upcoming trips to India, Indonesia and Japan and the need to \u201cnot [see] the US-China relationship as a binary choice for Australia\u201d. On Friday Morrison doubled down on the themes of the speech, telling reporters in Burnie that Australia would not take directions from global organisations \u201cthat are at odds with the national interest and with any presumption that somehow, some global agenda is bigger than Australia\u201d. Morrison cited \u201cborder protection\u201d as an example of a policy area where international organisations provide \u201ccommentary about what Australia should and shouldn\u2019t do\u201d. \u201cWe have taken issues to an election and policies to an election and those other policies I will implement and I will not be pushed into other policies by global institutions.\u201d Despite Frydenberg\u2019s denial, the Coalition\u2019s political allies were prepared to join the dots between Trump and Morrison\u2019s rhetoric. The Institute of Public Affairs policy director Gideon Rozner tweeted that Morrison is \u201cfollowing the [Donald Trump] playbook: Engage the base, deliver for the middle and ignore the bleating of people who will never, ever vote for you\u201d. On Friday foreign minister Marise Payne said that Morrison\u2019s speech had \u201cset out \u2026 Australia\u2019s long-held understanding that our security and our prosperity is absolutely underpinned by the rules-based international order\u201d. \u201cWe seek an international system that preserves the unique characteristics of individual states, sovereignty must be what we are about,\u201d Payne told reporters at a joint press conference with New Zealand\u2019s deputy prime minister and foreign affairs minister, Winston Peters, in Sydney. \u201cAt the same time, we have to have a system that gives a framework for cooperation on the most pressing issues for our security and prosperity.\u201d",
