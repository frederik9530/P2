It added that the government would lose a further \u00a31bn a year if rumours of a <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/motoring-industry-welcomes-boris-johnsons-plan-to-cut-fuel-duty-495203\">2p a litre cut </a>in fuel duty in the budget proved to be true.</p> <p>In a report, the IFS said taxes on driving would still be necessary even after the replacement of fossil-fuel powered cars by electric models because the costs of congested roads would remain a factor.</p> <p>The ideal approach, it added, would be a system of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/29/report-backs-per-mile-road-charging-scheme-for-london\">road pricing </a>under which the charges for driving would vary according to the time of day and the location. Those driving in busy places would pay more, but the majority of journeys would be taxed less heavily than at present, the IFS said.</p> <p>Road pricing has proved to be a hard sell with the public and the IFS said a second-best solution would be the introduction of a flat-rate tax per mile driven that would be used to supplement reduced revenue from fuel duties and help correct for the social costs of driving.</p> <p>There was an advantage in acting quickly, the IFS warned, because it would be much harder politically to introduce such taxes only once the revenue from fuel duties had dropped much further and many people had bought hybrid or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/12/electric-cars-already-cheaper-own-run-study\">electric cars </a>in the expectation of paying little tax on them.</p> <p>Rebekah Stroud, an IFS economist and co-author of the report said: \u201cCuts to fuel duties over the last two decades have contributed towards revenues\u2019 being \u00a319bn a year lower than they would have been.</p> <p>\u201cAnother 2p cut, as reportedly mooted by the prime minister, would cost a further \u00a31bn a year. The bigger challenge is that revenues are now set to disappear entirely over coming decades as we transition to electric cars.

      "bodyText": "Britain should move to a system of road pricing to combat congestion and compensate for the \u00a328bn loss of revenue from fuel duty as the country makes the transition to electric vehicles, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has said. The thinktank said the government\u2019s pledge that the UK would reach zero net emissions by 2050 meant the tax take from petrol and diesel would shrink to nothing over the coming decades and a new way to raise money from drivers was needed. The IFS said decisions by both Labour and Conservative governments not to raise fuel duty in line with inflation meant that duties had fallen from 2.2% to 1.3% of national income since peaking in 1999-2000, costing \u00a319bn a year in lost revenue. It added that the government would lose a further \u00a31bn a year if rumours of a 2p a litre cut in fuel duty in the budget proved to be true. In a report, the IFS said taxes on driving would still be necessary even after the replacement of fossil-fuel powered cars by electric models because the costs of congested roads would remain a factor. The ideal approach, it added, would be a system of road pricing under which the charges for driving would vary according to the time of day and the location. Those driving in busy places would pay more, but the majority of journeys would be taxed less heavily than at present, the IFS said. Road pricing has proved to be a hard sell with the public and the IFS said a second-best solution would be the introduction of a flat-rate tax per mile driven that would be used to supplement reduced revenue from fuel duties and help correct for the social costs of driving. There was an advantage in acting quickly, the IFS warned, because it would be much harder politically to introduce such taxes only once the revenue from fuel duties had dropped much further and many people had bought hybrid or electric cars in the expectation of paying little tax on them. Rebekah Stroud, an IFS economist and co-author of the report said: \u201cCuts to fuel duties over the last two decades have contributed towards revenues\u2019 being \u00a319bn a year lower than they would have been. \u201cAnother 2p cut, as reportedly mooted by the prime minister, would cost a further \u00a31bn a year. The bigger challenge is that revenues are now set to disappear entirely over coming decades as we transition to electric cars. The government should set out its long-term plan for taxing driving, before it finds itself with virtually no revenues from driving and no way to correct for the costs \u2013 most importantly congestion \u2013 that driving imposes on others.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The dirty secrets of a huge fatberg discovered lurking under the seafront of a Devon town have been laid bare after scientists carried out an \u201cautopsy\u201d of the monster. As expected, household cooking fats, wet wipes and other hygiene products were key components of the 64m-long beast (bigger than the Leaning Tower of Pisa) but it also contained bits of bone, twigs, string \u2013 and false teeth. Happily, it did not contain any detectable levels of toxic chemicals, and the scientists who examined lumps of it could not apportion blame for it to any particular businesses, neighbourhoods or groups. It appears to have been very much a community effort. The fatberg was discovered under The Esplanade in Sidmouth, a few metres from the sea, by South West Water just before Christmas last year and made headlines around the world. In February a hardy bunch of workers donned breathing apparatus to begin the painstaking process of hacking the fatberg into small pieces and removing it from the sewer. It took eight weeks and the monster was carted away in 36 tankers. A team of scientists from the University of Exeter were given the scarcely less enviable job of carrying out the autopsy to establish how it came into being and whether it posed environmental risks. The scientists were given four 10kg samples from the fatberg, which smelled like a heady combination of rotting meat and an unclean toilet. They melted the chunks and then combed through them by hand before subjecting samples to forensic analysis. The team found that the samples they received were mostly made of animal fats consistent with domestic food preparation combined with household hygiene products such as wet wipes and sanitary products, as well as natural and artificial fibres from toilet tissues and laundry. Crucially, the team found the fatberg contained no detectable levels of toxic chemicals, meaning its presence in the sewer did not pose a chemical or biological risk to the environment or human health. Prof John Love, a synthetic biology expert at the University of Exeter, said: \u201cWe worried that the fatberg might concentrate fat-soluble chemicals such as those found in contraceptives, contain now-banned microplastic beads from cosmetics and be rich in potentially pathogenic microbes, but we found no trace of these possible dangers. \u201cWe were all rather surprised to find that this Sidmouth fatberg was simply a lump of fat aggregated with wet wipes, sanitary towels and other household products that really should be put in the bin and not down the toilet.

The Responsible Investment Association of Australasia has found that the market for responsible investment - the kind that ultimately delivers a healthier economy, society and environment - has grown every year since 2014, increasing by 13% in 2018 to $980 billion, or 44% of all assets under management. Make your money a force for good Banking is ubiquitous; we all use it almost every day. What would happen if we all chose to trust our money with ethical banks? Clean money represents a huge opportunity for collective action. Imagine the difference we could make together if we took those billions of dollars from fossil fuel investment and put it into renewable energy or community housing. Start by checking out your bank\u2019s policies. If they\u2019re not freely available, ask for them. Even the simple act of demanding information from your bank can shift its thinking towards a sustainable future. If it still can\u2019t help you, look elsewhere.

      "body": "<h2>1) Rodgers returns to try to derail Klopp\u2019s perfect start</h2> \n<p>Brendan Rodgers returns to Anfield on Saturday, sensing an opportunity to end his former club\u2019s perfect Premier League start. Last season, a much less adventurous Leicester side <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/30/liverpool-leicester-premier-league-match-report\">got a point at Liverpool</a>, triggering a costly spell of self-doubt for J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s title chasers. There has been virtually no sign of weakness from the Reds in the league this term, but Salzburg\u2019s dramatic Champions League fightback may have shown Rodgers the way forward. Andrew Robertson and Trent Alexander-Arnold made surging infield runs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/02/liverpool-rb-salzburg-champions-league-match-report\">against Salzburg</a>, a tactic that helped Liverpool race into a three-goal lead as Robertson scored. As the game changed, the hosts were left exposed in wide areas as their opponents poured forward. Leicester will be a threat on the counter and have plenty of pace and craft on the flanks, not least through their own full-back pairing of Ben Chilwell and Ricardo Pereira. Rodgers\u2019 side are dangerous opponents, and Klopp will hope the reliable Jo\u00ebl Matip is available to slot back into central defence. <strong>NM</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Liverpool v Leicester, Saturday 3pm (all times BST)</em></p> \n<h2>2) A classic cannot be expected at St James\u2019</h2> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/audio/2019/oct/03/tottenham-tonking-and-the-future-of-the-game-football-weekly-extra-podcast\">Tottenham's tonking and the future of the game \u2013&nbsp;Football Weekly Extra</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Manchester United travel to St James\u2019 Park on Sunday, a year to the day since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/oct/06/manchester-united-newcastle-united-premier-league-match-report\">a 3-2 defeat at Old Trafford</a> where Alexis S\u00e1nchez\u2019s late winner saved Jos\u00e9 Mourinho from the sack. A year is a long time in football. While much has changed since, both teams are still dealing with the same fundamental issues. Manchester United cannot conjure any kind of consistency or fluidity, and Newcastle are short of goals and fearing relegation. Last year, Rafael Ben\u00edtez\u2019s safety-first approach got them out of trouble. Under Steve Bruce, they have lost their solidity at the back without getting any better going forward; they are the league\u2019s joint-lowest scorers. Since beating Chelsea 4-0 in their league opener, Manchester United have scored seven goals in nine games, with the turgid draws against AZ Alkmaar making it 10 away trips without a win. In short, don\u2019t expect another five-goal thriller in this Super Sunday showpiece. <strong>NM</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Newcastle v Manchester United, Sunday 4.30pm</em></p> \n<h2>3) Wolves need to keep discipline to have hope</h2> \n<p>Wolves\u2019 shaky start appears to be behind them now, with two victories and two clean sheets inside a week. Before the trip to Besiktas, captain Conor Coady had targeted defensive improvement and they delivered in Istanbul, with centre-back Willy Boly grabbing a last-gasp winner. Boly was a key figure in both fixtures against Manchester City last season, scoring a handball opener at Molineux and getting sent off early at the Etihad in a 3-0 defeat. That was Wolves\u2019 only league red card last term; this year, they have already doubled that tally, with Boly dismissed at Everton and Romain Saiss sent off at Crystal Palace. Defensive discipline is not all about keeping clean sheets, and while Wolves may travel in hope rather than expectation after such a long midweek trip, concentration will be key. In midweek, Dinamo Zagreb showed the benefits of taking on City with a clear defensive strategy; two weeks ago, Watford showed the pitfalls of not doing so. <strong>NM</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e39e5e9cdc2648e2e22499dc3204fb7f2e03bb0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e39e5e9cdc2648e2e22499dc3204fb7f2e03bb0/0_0_3078_2052/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wolverhampton Wanderers\u2019 Willy Boly points an accusing finger during the Premier League match against Everton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wolverhampton Wanderers\u2019 Willy Boly points an accusing finger during the Premier League match against Everton.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Stacpoole/0Offside via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><em>\u2022 Manchester City v Wolves, Sunday 2pm</em></p> \n<h2>4) Pochettino\u2019s men punished by allowing sides to shoot</h2> \n<p>It is hard to put a positive spin on a 7-2 defeat, but it is certainly possible to make it appear less negative. \u201cTottenham were fantastic at the start of the game, they could have been two- or three-nil up. Some real impressive play, pressing, put them under pressure,\u201d said Graham Potter, for whom <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/01/tottenham-hotspur-bayern-munich-champions-league-match-report\">Spurs\u2019 pummelling at the hands of Bayern</a> Munich was probably too extraordinary to be particularly useful. Bayern had just 11 shots on target; Philippe Coutinho was the only player to test Hugo Lloris without scoring, and he only did it once. The xG statistics suggest that Bayern should have scored no more than two goals (1.24 to be precise), which indicates the Tottenham defence isn\u2019t <em>that </em>broken (or that xG statistics <em>really</em> are). Still, Tottenham could certainly do with restricting opponents\u2019 shot-taking a bit: they have let their opponents have 112 this season (24 more than Brighton), and the 44 shots on target they have conceded is the most in the league, and already 40% of their figure for the entire 2016-17 season, when they finished second to Chelsea. Lloris was unlucky to be beaten so often on Tuesday, but he is being tested much too frequently. <strong>SB</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Brighton v Tottenham, Saturday 12.30pm</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"9ebc157e-d6f9-4fb5-953a-6dea3211b695\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vGbMhQCHejk?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>5) West Ham look to build on positive start</strong></h2> \n<p>It remains early days but West Ham appear to have bridged a gap they been trying to bridge for a while. A spluttering of mid-table finishes failed to stimulate much excitement around a club that harbours explicit hopes of qualifying for Europe, but there are signs they could make a reasonable play for those places under Manuel Pellegrini. S\u00e9bastien Haller <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/who-scored-blog/2019/jul/18/sebastien-haller-west-ham-good-business-transfer\">came at a cost</a>, but the \u00a345m striker looks more than just a 6ft 3in handful and, behind him, Pellegrini has a plethora of options to pick from, including the fit-again Manuel Lanzini. How they will fare without <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/30/west-ham-fear-lukasz-fabianski-could-be-out-for-three-months-with-thigh-injury\">the injured Lukasz Fabianski</a> remains to be seen, but with Everton and Wolves yet to convince, it would be wrong to overlook Pellegrini\u2019s credentials to deliver a top-seven finish. The Chilean has form for parachuting unfancied teams into the upper echelons, having propelled Villarreal and M\u00e1laga into Europe, and early evidence suggests West Ham, who finished 10th last season, have the tools to go close. <strong>BF</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 West Ham v Crystal Palace, Saturday 5.30pm</em></p> \n<h2>6) Farke hopes faith in promoted squad can pay</h2> \n<p>These teams last met when the Canaries secured the victory that brought them last season\u2019s Championship title. The extent of Aston Villa\u2019s post-promotion recruitment drive is no secret but here is a telling illustration: of the 14 players who played either from the start or from the bench for Norwich that day all are still at the club, every one has played in the Premier League and most are doing so regularly, having between them played 5,378 league minutes. Of the 13 players who appeared for Aston Villa six have left the club, two remain but have not been used and just two have started a top-flight match since promotion. Between them those 13 players have played 828 minutes, of which Neil Taylor is single-handedly responsible for 568. Take away Taylor and the remaining 12 have, on average, played a mere 21 minutes and 40 seconds of league football for Villa this season, or a still unimpressive 43 minutes 20 seconds if you discount the departed players. Take away the one member of that Norwich side who has been most used this season, Ben Godfrey, and the remainder have averaged 360 minutes and 23 seconds. For all that the sides are currently separated by only one point, but this is a chance for one of them to prove that their methodology is superior. <strong>SB</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Norwich v Aston Villa, Saturday 3pm</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b5c42063-e9a0-49a2-92c5-24ba2021a269\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Twitter:</b> follow us at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardian_sport\">@guardian_sport</a></p>\n    <p><b>Facebook:</b> like our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardianfootball\">football</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiansport\">sport</a> pages</p>\n    <p><b>Instagram:</b> our favourite <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardian_sport/\">photos, films and stories</a></p>\n    <p><b>YouTube:</b> subscribe to our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/GuardianFootball\">football</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwD9E_QNwFwrQC7OnPnrg2Q\">sport</a> channels</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>7) Bournemouth seek statement scalp at Arsenal</strong></h2> \n<p>Bournemouth have made a decent start to the season but a scalp would make the rest of the division truly sit up and take notice going into the international break. Last season they earned notable victories over Chelsea and Tottenham on home soil but failed to take points off any of the top six away from Dean Court, mustering three goals along the way. They were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/27/arsenal-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report\">thumped 5-1</a> by Unai Emery\u2019s side in February and in their last eight meetings, the aggregate score reads 20-8 against Eddie Howe\u2019s side. There is no doubt Bournemouth can hurt teams and Philip Billing has formed a promising midfield partnership with Jefferson Lerma, but a defence that is susceptible to leaking cheap goals \u2013 one without a clean sheet in the Premier League this campaign \u2013 will likely be tested again in north London. If Howe can find a defensive remedy, Arsenal could be in for another difficult afternoon. <strong>BF</strong></p> \n<p>\u2022 <em>Arsenal v Bournemouth, Sunday 2pm</em></p> \n<h2><strong>8) Saints need points fast as tough spell arrives</strong></h2> \n<p>It was made abundantly clear to Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl that beating Portsmouth was non-negotiable, and that Southampton supporters would happily shrug off defeats in the league games that bookended that Carabao Cup tie at Fratton Park safe in the knowledge they had recorded <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/24/portsmouth-southampton-carabao-cup-match-report\">victory over their despised rivals</a>. But they can ill-afford league form to suffer too much. If they fall to defeat at home to an in-form Chelsea, they will have lost three Premier League games on the bounce. After the international break they travel to Wolves and host Leicester before November presents trips to Manchester City and Arsenal. Victory over Pompey was priceless but they need to pick up points and fast \u2013 particularly at home, where they are yet to taste victory this season \u2013 if they are to avoid getting dragged into another all-too familiar relegation scrap. <strong>BF</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"232df53639e0b9bd5e7e078db6f01200e5269634\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/232df53639e0b9bd5e7e078db6f01200e5269634/0_107_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Southampton fans celebrate their second goal in their 4-0 Carabao Cup win over Portsmouth.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Southampton fans celebrate their second goal in their 4-0 Carabao Cup win over Portsmouth.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Sibley/Action Images via Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u2022 <em>Southampton v Chelsea, Sunday 2pm</em></p> \n<h2>9) Dyche determined to make amends for last season\u2019s 5-1</h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/26/burnley-everton-premier-league-match-report\">Everton\u2019s last visit to Burnley</a> will provoke unusually conflicting memories for the home side. It was, on one level, a complete humiliation: they were a goal down inside two minutes, three behind by the time the opening period was halfway through, and went on to lose 5-1. After that game, however, Sean Dyche made a few changes \u2013 Dwight McNeil had started once all season but has only failed to start one league game since; Joe Hart had played every league game but has not got off the bench since \u2013 Burnley won five and lost none of their next eight and proceeded to finish comfortably clear of relegation. \u201cI thought we bottomed out that day,\u201d Sean Dyche said as the season neared its conclusion. \u201cIt is a hard thing to put your finger on but it is a collective thing of, \u2018That\u2019s enough.\u2019\u201d Now they will want to show the extent of their improvement against the side that pushed them to the bottom. \u201cIt\u2019s one we want to put right,\u201d Ben Mee said. \u201cWe\u2019ll definitely be up for it and it will be a good buzz if we get a good result.\u201d <strong>SB</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Burnley v Everton, Saturday 3pm</em></p> \n<h2>10) Watford must find shooting form to arrest tailspin</h2> \n<p>Of Watford\u2019s last 19 league games, amounting to exactly half of a top-flight season, they have won only four, and taken a total of 15 points. That is point accumulation at a rate that would guarantee relegation if continued over an entire campaign, and partly explains the haste with which they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/07/watford-sack-head-coach-javi-gracia-after-poor-start-to-the-season\">disposed of Javi Gracia last month</a>, after he led his team to one point from four winnable matches. More worrying still, all but one of those four victories came against teams now playing in the Championship. Not since Andre Gray\u2019s last-minute goal brought a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/mar/03/watford-leicester-premier-league-match-report\">2-1 win over Leicester</a> more than seven months ago have Watford beaten a current Premier League side. They took 16 of a possible 18 points against the teams that eventually went down last season, and this first meeting of the season with a recently-promoted side is a chance for them to see if they feel equally at home against sides that eventually came up. Watford\u2019s defence is seen, not unreasonably, as the side\u2019s great weakness but it is surely time for their attack to contribute a little more: they have taken 105 shots \u2013 more than every side except Manchester City (150), Chelsea (120) and Liverpool (105), but of those only 30 have been on target and just four have gone in. <strong>SB</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Watford v Sheffield

      "bodyText": "1) Rodgers returns to try to derail Klopp\u2019s perfect start Brendan Rodgers returns to Anfield on Saturday, sensing an opportunity to end his former club\u2019s perfect Premier League start. Last season, a much less adventurous Leicester side got a point at Liverpool, triggering a costly spell of self-doubt for J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s title chasers. There has been virtually no sign of weakness from the Reds in the league this term, but Salzburg\u2019s dramatic Champions League fightback may have shown Rodgers the way forward. Andrew Robertson and Trent Alexander-Arnold made surging infield runs against Salzburg, a tactic that helped Liverpool race into a three-goal lead as Robertson scored. As the game changed, the hosts were left exposed in wide areas as their opponents poured forward. Leicester will be a threat on the counter and have plenty of pace and craft on the flanks, not least through their own full-back pairing of Ben Chilwell and Ricardo Pereira. Rodgers\u2019 side are dangerous opponents, and Klopp will hope the reliable Jo\u00ebl Matip is available to slot back into central defence. NM \u2022 Liverpool v Leicester, Saturday 3pm (all times BST) 2) A classic cannot be expected at St James\u2019 Manchester United travel to St James\u2019 Park on Sunday, a year to the day since a 3-2 defeat at Old Trafford where Alexis S\u00e1nchez\u2019s late winner saved Jos\u00e9 Mourinho from the sack. A year is a long time in football. While much has changed since, both teams are still dealing with the same fundamental issues. Manchester United cannot conjure any kind of consistency or fluidity, and Newcastle are short of goals and fearing relegation. Last year, Rafael Ben\u00edtez\u2019s safety-first approach got them out of trouble. Under Steve Bruce, they have lost their solidity at the back without getting any better going forward; they are the league\u2019s joint-lowest scorers. Since beating Chelsea 4-0 in their league opener, Manchester United have scored seven goals in nine games, with the turgid draws against AZ Alkmaar making it 10 away trips without a win. In short, don\u2019t expect another five-goal thriller in this Super Sunday showpiece. NM \u2022 Newcastle v Manchester United, Sunday 4.30pm 3) Wolves need to keep discipline to have hope Wolves\u2019 shaky start appears to be behind them now, with two victories and two clean sheets inside a week. Before the trip to Besiktas, captain Conor Coady had targeted defensive improvement and they delivered in Istanbul, with centre-back Willy Boly grabbing a last-gasp winner. Boly was a key figure in both fixtures against Manchester City last season, scoring a handball opener at Molineux and getting sent off early at the Etihad in a 3-0 defeat. That was Wolves\u2019 only league red card last term; this year, they have already doubled that tally, with Boly dismissed at Everton and Romain Saiss sent off at Crystal Palace. Defensive discipline is not all about keeping clean sheets, and while Wolves may travel in hope rather than expectation after such a long midweek trip, concentration will be key. In midweek, Dinamo Zagreb showed the benefits of taking on City with a clear defensive strategy; two weeks ago, Watford showed the pitfalls of not doing so. NM \u2022 Manchester City v Wolves, Sunday 2pm 4) Pochettino\u2019s men punished by allowing sides to shoot It is hard to put a positive spin on a 7-2 defeat, but it is certainly possible to make it appear less negative. \u201cTottenham were fantastic at the start of the game, they could have been two- or three-nil up. Some real impressive play, pressing, put them under pressure,\u201d said Graham Potter, for whom Spurs\u2019 pummelling at the hands of Bayern Munich was probably too extraordinary to be particularly useful. Bayern had just 11 shots on target; Philippe Coutinho was the only player to test Hugo Lloris without scoring, and he only did it once. The xG statistics suggest that Bayern should have scored no more than two goals (1.24 to be precise), which indicates the Tottenham defence isn\u2019t that broken (or that xG statistics really are). Still, Tottenham could certainly do with restricting opponents\u2019 shot-taking a bit: they have let their opponents have 112 this season (24 more than Brighton), and the 44 shots on target they have conceded is the most in the league, and already 40% of their figure for the entire 2016-17 season, when they finished second to Chelsea. Lloris was unlucky to be beaten so often on Tuesday, but he is being tested much too frequently. SB \u2022 Brighton v Tottenham, Saturday 12.30pm 5) West Ham look to build on positive start It remains early days but West Ham appear to have bridged a gap they been trying to bridge for a while. A spluttering of mid-table finishes failed to stimulate much excitement around a club that harbours explicit hopes of qualifying for Europe, but there are signs they could make a reasonable play for those places under Manuel Pellegrini. S\u00e9bastien Haller came at a cost, but the \u00a345m striker looks more than just a 6ft 3in handful and, behind him, Pellegrini has a plethora of options to pick from, including the fit-again Manuel Lanzini. How they will fare without the injured Lukasz Fabianski remains to be seen, but with Everton and Wolves yet to convince, it would be wrong to overlook Pellegrini\u2019s credentials to deliver a top-seven finish. The Chilean has form for parachuting unfancied teams into the upper echelons, having propelled Villarreal and M\u00e1laga into Europe, and early evidence suggests West Ham, who finished 10th last season, have the tools to go close. BF \u2022 West Ham v Crystal Palace, Saturday 5.30pm 6) Farke hopes faith in promoted squad can pay These teams last met when the Canaries secured the victory that brought them last season\u2019s Championship title. The extent of Aston Villa\u2019s post-promotion recruitment drive is no secret but here is a telling illustration: of the 14 players who played either from the start or from the bench for Norwich that day all are still at the club, every one has played in the Premier League and most are doing so regularly, having between them played 5,378 league minutes. Of the 13 players who appeared for Aston Villa six have left the club, two remain but have not been used and just two have started a top-flight match since promotion. Between them those 13 players have played 828 minutes, of which Neil Taylor is single-handedly responsible for 568. Take away Taylor and the remaining 12 have, on average, played a mere 21 minutes and 40 seconds of league football for Villa this season, or a still unimpressive 43 minutes 20 seconds if you discount the departed players. Take away the one member of that Norwich side who has been most used this season, Ben Godfrey, and the remainder have averaged 360 minutes and 23 seconds. For all that the sides are currently separated by only one point, but this is a chance for one of them to prove that their methodology is superior. SB \u2022 Norwich v Aston Villa, Saturday 3pm 7) Bournemouth seek statement scalp at Arsenal Bournemouth have made a decent start to the season but a scalp would make the rest of the division truly sit up and take notice going into the international break. Last season they earned notable victories over Chelsea and Tottenham on home soil but failed to take points off any of the top six away from Dean Court, mustering three goals along the way. They were thumped 5-1 by Unai Emery\u2019s side in February and in their last eight meetings, the aggregate score reads 20-8 against Eddie Howe\u2019s side. There is no doubt Bournemouth can hurt teams and Philip Billing has formed a promising midfield partnership with Jefferson Lerma, but a defence that is susceptible to leaking cheap goals \u2013 one without a clean sheet in the Premier League this campaign \u2013 will likely be tested again in north London. If Howe can find a defensive remedy, Arsenal could be in for another difficult afternoon. BF \u2022 Arsenal v Bournemouth, Sunday 2pm 8) Saints need points fast as tough spell arrives It was made abundantly clear to Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl that beating Portsmouth was non-negotiable, and that Southampton supporters would happily shrug off defeats in the league games that bookended that Carabao Cup tie at Fratton Park safe in the knowledge they had recorded victory over their despised rivals. But they can ill-afford league form to suffer too much. If they fall to defeat at home to an in-form Chelsea, they will have lost three Premier League games on the bounce. After the international break they travel to Wolves and host Leicester before November presents trips to Manchester City and Arsenal. Victory over Pompey was priceless but they need to pick up points and fast \u2013 particularly at home, where they are yet to taste victory this season \u2013 if they are to avoid getting dragged into another all-too familiar relegation scrap. BF \u2022 Southampton v Chelsea, Sunday 2pm 9) Dyche determined to make amends for last season\u2019s 5-1 Everton\u2019s last visit to Burnley will provoke unusually conflicting memories for the home side. It was, on one level, a complete humiliation: they were a goal down inside two minutes, three behind by the time the opening period was halfway through, and went on to lose 5-1. After that game, however, Sean Dyche made a few changes \u2013 Dwight McNeil had started once all season but has only failed to start one league game since; Joe Hart had played every league game but has not got off the bench since \u2013 Burnley won five and lost none of their next eight and proceeded to finish comfortably clear of relegation. \u201cI thought we bottomed out that day,\u201d Sean Dyche said as the season neared its conclusion. \u201cIt is a hard thing to put your finger on but it is a collective thing of, \u2018That\u2019s enough.\u2019\u201d Now they will want to show the extent of their improvement against the side that pushed them to the bottom. \u201cIt\u2019s one we want to put right,\u201d Ben Mee said. \u201cWe\u2019ll definitely be up for it and it will be a good buzz if we get a good result.\u201d SB \u2022 Burnley v Everton, Saturday 3pm 10) Watford must find shooting form to arrest tailspin Of Watford\u2019s last 19 league games, amounting to exactly half of a top-flight season, they have won only four, and taken a total of 15 points. That is point accumulation at a rate that would guarantee relegation if continued over an entire campaign, and partly explains the haste with which they disposed of Javi Gracia last month, after he led his team to one point from four winnable matches. More worrying still, all but one of those four victories came against teams now playing in the Championship. Not since Andre Gray\u2019s last-minute goal brought a 2-1 win over Leicester more than seven months ago have Watford beaten a current Premier League side. They took 16 of a possible 18 points against the teams that eventually went down last season, and this first meeting of the season with a recently-promoted side is a chance for them to see if they feel equally at home against sides that eventually came up. Watford\u2019s defence is seen, not unreasonably, as the side\u2019s great weakness but it is surely time for their attack to contribute a little more: they have taken 105 shots \u2013 more than every side except Manchester City (150), Chelsea (120) and Liverpool (105), but of those only 30 have been on target and just four have gone in.

Arsenal were indeed quick, not only in the tempo of their play but also in how they built their lead. Three goals were scored inside the opening 22 minutes, with Martinelli getting his first on 13 minutes via a perfectly timed glancing header from Tierney\u2019s near-post cross. The Brazilian\u2019s second came from practically the same spot, this time via a composed right-foot finish, and entered him into Arsenal\u2019s record books; at 18 years and 107 days he is the youngest player to have scored two goals in a major European game for the club. Martinelli should have completed his hat-trick on 53 minutes but directed a low shot from in front of a practically open net wide of the far post. In the grand scheme of things it did not matter \u2013 by that stage the hosts were rampant having gone 3-0 ahead thanks to Willock\u2019s cool finish. Then came Ceballos\u2019s goal, his first for Arsenal since arriving from Real Madrid on loan.",

However, one of the most significant moments came right at the end and off the track. Seconds after finally winning the title she has craved and failed to win for years, one of the first things on Katarina Johnson-Thompson\u2019s mind: \u201cI just want more.\u201d</p> <p>Bring on Tokyo.

Honestly, these whole two days have been so fast and it\u2019s been at night time it\u2019s actually felt like a dream and the lights and everything. It\u2019s just been unbelievable and I can\u2019t believe this is the result. It\u2019s just been so many attempts to perform at this stage. I\u2019m just so, so happy.</p> <p>I could\u2019ve done without [the disappointments] it\u2019s traumatic enough, not gonna lie. I\u2019m sure it would have been sweet in 2015 but here we are. No, you\u2019re right. The low moments have obviously helped me come back and make the move. Try to look within myself. Yeah, I\u2019m just so happy.</p> <p>Yeah, this has been my dream. Obviously 7000 points, [as] I\u2019ve spoken about in the past, is one of my main career goals. The thing called score calculator which adds up all the points, I\u2019ve been doing different combinations of it for my entire life. For the last year or so I\u2019ve chilled with these predictions. I\u2019ve just tried to compete, I\u2019ve tried to perform, I\u2019ve just tried to beat myself and I think I\u2019ve found a formula that works and I just want more.</p> <p>Yeah, [Thiam is] a phenomenal athlete. She set the standard. Obviously there\u2019s greats in the past like Kluft, but I witnessed 7k points first through her and she was the one who made that doable and who made that a requirement also in order to win. She\u2019s definitely raised the bar and I\u2019m just glad I\u2019ve been able to follow and step up. And yeah, I\u2019m just competitive.</p> <p>Yeah, [moving to France has] definitely paid off. It\u2019s been such a long road but I\u2019m so glad that I\u2019m coming to my best in these two big years.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-03T22:06:09.026Z\">at 11.06pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d966c0e8f08fbb0c17208e1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-03T21:45:57.784Z\">10.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/nzaccardi/status/1179873937729175553\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Kaul does it with the second-highest Day 2 decathlon score in history. 4,164 on Day 1, 4,527 on Day 2.

      "bodyText": "Another day comes to an end. I\u2019m still getting my head around that absolutely insane 400 metres race (48.14!) and the final two events from Niklas Kaul in the decathlon. However, one of the most significant moments came right at the end and off the track. Seconds after finally winning the title she has craved and failed to win for years, one of the first things on Katarina Johnson-Thompson\u2019s mind: \u201cI just want more.\u201d Bring on Tokyo. Good night. Here\u2019s Katarina Johnson-Thompson\u2019s on her victory from the BBC: It doesn\u2019t make sense to me. Honestly, these whole two days have been so fast and it\u2019s been at night time it\u2019s actually felt like a dream and the lights and everything. It\u2019s just been unbelievable and I can\u2019t believe this is the result. It\u2019s just been so many attempts to perform at this stage. I\u2019m just so, so happy. I could\u2019ve done without [the disappointments] it\u2019s traumatic enough, not gonna lie. I\u2019m sure it would have been sweet in 2015 but here we are. No, you\u2019re right. The low moments have obviously helped me come back and make the move. Try to look within myself. Yeah, I\u2019m just so happy. Yeah, this has been my dream. Obviously 7000 points, [as] I\u2019ve spoken about in the past, is one of my main career goals. The thing called score calculator which adds up all the points, I\u2019ve been doing different combinations of it for my entire life. For the last year or so I\u2019ve chilled with these predictions. I\u2019ve just tried to compete, I\u2019ve tried to perform, I\u2019ve just tried to beat myself and I think I\u2019ve found a formula that works and I just want more. Yeah, [Thiam is] a phenomenal athlete. She set the standard. Obviously there\u2019s greats in the past like Kluft, but I witnessed 7k points first through her and she was the one who made that doable and who made that a requirement also in order to win. She\u2019s definitely raised the bar and I\u2019m just glad I\u2019ve been able to follow and step up. And yeah, I\u2019m just competitive. Yeah, [moving to France has] definitely paid off. It\u2019s been such a long road but I\u2019m so glad that I\u2019m coming to my best in these two big years. Here is Sean Ingle on Katarina Johnson-Thompson\u2019s historic win. The final decathlon standings: Niklas Kaul 8691 Maicel Uibo 8604 Damian Warner 8529 What a smash and grab from the young German. He sat in sixth going into the final two events, far from the top. Then he produced a decathlon world record in the javelin throw and picked the field apart in the 1500 metres. Niklas Kaul of Germany wins the men\u2019s decathlon world title. What an incredible run from the 21 year-old, who absolutely destroyed the field with a run of 4:15.71. He is the youngest decathlon world champion ever. As things stand in the decathlon: Maicel Uibo 7869 Damian Warner 7854 Niklas Kaul 7850 Ilya Shkurenyov 7826 Pierce Lepage 7796 And now it\u2019s time for the exhausting decathlon 1500m to end the day. The final heptathlon standings: Katarina Johnson-Thompson (GBR) 6981 Nafi Thiam (BEL) 6677 Verena Preiner (AUT) 6560 After everything Johnson-Thompson has been through to win this first world gold medal, this must feel so sweet. Johnson-Thompson wins the 800 metres with a personal best of 2:07.26. What a gutsy, gutsy race. She led from the front and pushed herself until the end. She takes the British heptathlon record with 6981 points. Katarina Johnson-Thompson is the heptathlon world champion! She breaks the British record. Reminder, Katarina Johnson-Thompson has a 10 second cushion on Nafi Thiam. There were many weary legs in the first heat, as you would expect after seven events. Let\u2019s see what KJT has left. Hanne Maudens of Belgium wins the first heptathlon heat in 2:12.98. A reminder of how things currently stand. Soon. The heptathletes are finally on the track for the 800 metres heats. Johnson-Thompson will start in the second heat. As Eid Naser takes her lap of honour, she is in complete shock. For good reason. That was one of the fastest races of all time and it is hard to believe. Eid Naser absolutely exploded out of the blocks but, as she has done so often, she just kept such an even pace throughout. Eid Naser\u2019s 48.14 is the third fastest time of all time. Miller-Uibo is 6th on the all time list. This is incredible. Salwa Eid Naser wins the 400 metres world title in 48.14!! Astonishing. Shaunae Miller-Uibo ran 48.37 yet still lost. A very exciting women\u2019s 400 metres is minutes away. Shaunae Miller-Uibo of The Bahamas arrives as the favourite and she has looked brilliant throughout, reaching the final with an easy 49.66. But the young Bahraini Salwa Eid Naser continues to nip at her heels, and also recorded an extremely relaxed 49.79. This could be incredibly fast. Defending champion Lijiao Gong of China takes gold in the women\u2019s shot put with a throw of 19.55m. Jamaica\u2019s Danniel Thomas-Dodd takes silver with a brilliant final round throw of 19.47m. Christina Schwanitz of Germany, who is crying with joy, takes bronze with a 19.17m throw. In the decathlon javelin throw, Niklas Kaul throws an absurd 79.05. Kaul is the world U20 record holder but he is already making a move at the top of the sport. He sits in third place, just 19 points from Maicel Uibo in first place. Here\u2019s Sean Ingle\u2019s report on more fallout from Alberto Salazar\u2019s ban. Laura Muir moves into the 1500 metres final with a solid, controlled run. Like Hassan, Muir started the race at the back of the pack and waited to see how the chips fell. When Gudaf Tsegay burst ahead, Muir immediately responded and moved up the pack, powering into the final from the front. Jenny Simpson of the United States wins in 4:00.99. That was fast. Laura Muir will be running in the second 1500m semi-final. It has been a tough season with injuries. Let\u2019s see what she\u2019s got. Sifan Hassan did what she always does in 1500m, biding her time at the back of the race and then easing past the entire field to the front. She takes the first 1500m semi-final in 4:14.69, which is not fast at all. Faith Kipyegon also survived but Sarah McDonald was run out in seventh. It\u2019s time for the semi-finals of the women\u2019s 1500 metres. Sifan Hassan and defending champion Faith Kipyegon, who is returning after pregnancy, will be looking to advance. Britain\u2019s Sarah McDonald also present. Ayanleh Souleiman takes the third heat in 3:36.16. Britain\u2019s Neil Gourley is comfortably through in fourth place. More dramatically, the second heat is being looked at after Filip Ingebrigtsen seemed to impede Teddese Lemi of Ethiopia, who fell to the ground and then finished in 11th place. Michael Johnson seems convinced that Lemi will be reinstated for the semi-final, but will Filip Ingebrigtsen be disqualified? Timothy Cheruiyot takes the second 1500 metres heat in 3:36.82. But what a dramatic race! Australia\u2019s Matthew Ramsden fell at the very beginning, then the race ended with far too much barging for a sport unrelated to the WWE. Britain\u2019s Josh Kerr evades the drama, producing a very solid second place finish. In the second men\u2019s 1500 metres heat, event favourite Timothy Cheruiyot will make his mark on the competition. Filip Ingebrigtsen, 2017 bronze medalist, is also a notable name. Britain\u2019s Josh Kerr will be looking to continue his solid season with a semi-final. The top six advance. Jakob Ingebrigtsen wins the first 1500 metres heat in 3:37.67. Britain\u2019s Jake Wightman qualified well in fourth place. The big shock is Samuel Tefera of Ethiopia, one of the pre-event favourites, who finished in seventh place and faces a nervous wait to reach tomorrow\u2019s semi-final as a fast loser. It\u2019s time for the men\u2019s 1500 metres heats. Timothy Cheruiyot begins as the clear event favourite after his brilliant form and 3:28.77 world lead. The precocious Jakob Ingebrigtsen will be the most notable name in this opener. New Zealand\u2019s Tomas Walsh qualifies for the men\u2019s shot put final with a throw of 21.92. Orlando Ortega of Spain has been awarded bronze medal after he was badly obstructed by Omar McLeod in the 110 metre hurdles final. If you remember, he was sitting in second place before McLeod stumbled into his lane. A good decision. We\u2019ll have to wait three hours for the climax but it should be worth it. Should Katarina Johnson-Thompson remain on Thiam\u2019s shoulder to guarantee gold or push herself in pursuit of the British record? A silly question, of course. She always goes for it. One more to go. Katarina Johnson-Thompson\u2019s 800 metres personal best is 2:07.64 and her season best is 2:08.28. Nafi Thiam\u2019s personal best is 2:15.24 and her season best is 2:20.46. All the Brit has to do is survive. In the decathlon, Maicel Uibo jumps a 5.40 personal best on his second attempt. A very significant leap as it moves him up into joint third place, level on points with Damian Warner. With Mayer\u2019s withdrawal, leader Pierce Lepage is only 24 points ahead of the pair in third place. This could be tight. Johnson-Thompson\u2019s final throw comes in at 40.55. After two safer deliveries, she went for a far more aggressive run up and attempted to throw with all her might. But she ended up too close to the line. The good news is that there\u2019s a lot more to come from her on this event in the future. Nafi Thiam has left the stadium without a third throw! So, Johnson-Thompson will go into the 800 metres with a lead of 137 points. Team KJT is laughing, and for good reason. Nafi Thiam throws 48.04 for a season best. An improvement, but it\u2019s still not enough. As things stand, Johnson-Thompson holds 5976 points compared to Thiam\u2019s 5839. A 137 point gap. Katarina Johnson-Thompson throws a personal best of 43.93. Stunning. Nafi Thiam attempts her first throw of the day. It flies to around the 42 metre mark, but Thiam deliberately steps beyond the boundary to register it as a foul. That throw is not useful to her. She needs more. As the BBC presenters noted, beyond the great performances from Johnson-Thompson, it\u2019s just really pleasing to see her looking so relaxed. Of course she is nervous, but she is so much more confident in her ability to produce her best. No matter how this finishes, she has forced Thiam to come up with something special. Katarina Johnson-Thompson starts in the javelin with a throw of 42.21. Not bad at all. The heptathletes are preparing for the javelin throw now. Thiam\u2019s personal best is a monster 59.32 with a season best of 47.25. Javelin is historically one of KJT\u2019s worst events, but she threw a respectable personal best of 42.92 this year. Going into the pole vault, one of his best events, Kevin Mayer lead with 6310 points to Damian Warner\u2019s 6254. 7 events down. All of that suffering for nothing. Brutal. A tough, tough decathlon for defending champion and world record holder Kevin Mayer. Chris Parker, via email, on the big battle for Heptathlon gold: \u201cKJT can make up 100 points, maybe 130 on a good day in the 800m, so a 20/30 point lead from the long jump could be crucial. The javelin has typically been her problem, but yesterday\u2019s shot put was a great sign of her improvement, hopefully she can do something similar in the javelin.\u201d And here is Dina with her medal. Katarina Johnson-Thompson goes for broke on the final jump and records a foul. But the damage has been done and they will head to the penultimate event with Johnson-Thompson holding a lead of 216 points. With her final jump, Thiam records an improved score of 6.40 metres, but it\u2019s not enough. For the first time in the contest she is shaking her head. Johnson-Thompson has a pressure-free opportunity to see if she can extend her lead before the javelin. As things currently stand, Johnson-Thompson has moved up to 5233 points compared to Thiam\u2019s haul of 5001. The Belgian\u2019s final jump will likely have a huge impact on how this battle pans out. Katarina Johnson-Thompson jumps 6.77! A slight improvement for Thiam, who records a jump of 6.35m. Just three centimetres further. Will either heptathlete make their mark in this event? Katarina Johnson-Thompson jumps 6.32 in the first round. She slightly extends her lead on Thiam, but the pair are in the same position and can do better. For reference, Thiam\u2019s 2019 best is 6.86 and Johnson-Thompson\u2019s is 6.85. Nafi Thiam\u2019s first jump is 6.25m. She currently sits second behind her teammate Hanne Maudens\u2019 effort of 6.41, but she will need much more than that. And here are the full heptathlon standings with some fancy projections. The full schedule for today. GMT+2. Hello! Welcome to day 7 of our World Athletics Championships coverage. Today marks the second day of the mixed events as Britain\u2019s Katarina Johnson-Thompson looks to continue her great form after finishing day one 96 points ahead of Nafi Thiam. We will begin with the all important long jump, where ample points are on offer and both women are incredibly strong. Later on in the day, the heptathletes will take to the javelin throw and Thiam may look to stamp her authority on the competition. Finally, they will end with a brutal 800 metres to decide the world champion. Meanwhile, Kevin Mayer will continue his attempts to hold off all challengers after finishing day one in third place. After the 110 metres hurdles earlier today and the ongoing discus throw, the decathletes will head to pole vault and javelin throw in the field events. A harrowing 1500 metres awaits at the end.",

Jordan added that the creature must have caused quite a splash when the homeowners found it. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine \u2026 going to the sliding glass doors and looking out there and seeing a 1,200lb moose or 800lb moose in my pool.\u201d In a Facebook post to accompany the video, the New Hampshire fish and game department wrote: \u201cWith the moose breeding season beginning to ramp up, bulls are on the move looking for mates. In his travels, this young bull accidentally found his way into a swimming pool in Bedford last night. NHF&amp;G Wildlife Biologists, with assistance from local Conservation Officers, were able to help remove the moose from the pool. The moose was unable to get himself out after several hours as the pool had no stairs. By putting a set of wooden steps in the pool and coaxing the moose towards them, he was able to find his way out and back in to the woods.\u201d",

That did give Wolves more impetus, but Besiktas were the first to threaten after the break, Caner Erkin forcing a save from Rui Patr\u00edcio from long range. That was the game\u2019s first shot on target.</p> <p>Wolves soon mustered an effort of their own, albeit without troubling Karius, as Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez headed over a free-kick by Jo\u00e3o Moutinho.

By the 20th minute Besiktas had created so little that the home fans began to barrack them for passing sideways. It was music to Wolves\u2019 ears. Wolves could have made the home side panic. Instead they were too circumspect, effectively inviting Besiktas to regain courage and attack. Jeremain Lens began to worry Jonny Otto down the right, while Adem Ljajic darted about between the lines and chinks of vulnerability began to appear in the Wolves defence. The home side nearly broke through before the break. Mohamed Elneny, the midfielder on loan from Arsenal, tried to reintroduce himself to the Premier League side by scoring from six yards, but his header from a corner by Ljajic flew over the bar. Just before half-time another corner caused even more trouble, with a deflection leading Conor Coady to slice it towards his own goal. The defender was grateful to see the ball bounce out off a post before he blocked Dorukhan Tokoz\u2019s follow-up. By half-time Wolves had failed to test the reliability of Besiktas\u2019s other player on loan from the Premier League, with Liverpool\u2019s Loris Karius practically a spectator, albeit not as loud as the ones now cranking up the volume in the home crowd. Nuno tried to push his team on the front foot by putting on Adama Traor\u00e9 for Pedro Neto. That did give Wolves more impetus, but Besiktas were the first to threaten after the break, Caner Erkin forcing a save from Rui Patr\u00edcio from long range. That was the game\u2019s first shot on target. Wolves soon mustered an effort of their own, albeit without troubling Karius, as Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez headed over a free-kick by Jo\u00e3o Moutinho. On the hour Boly met a corner from the right but headed over from six yards. With the game opening up, Domagoj Vida flashed a header inches wide in the 68th minute. In the final 10 minutes Patrick Cutrone, on as a substitute for Jim\u00e9nez, fired wide of the far post after being released by a counterattack. Wolves thought they had snatched victory in the dying minutes when Romain Sa\u00efss turned the ball into the net from close range after a header from a corner had been spilled. The linesman ruled it out for offside and with VAR not being used in the Europa League group stages there was no prospect of the decision being overruled. No matter, Wolves did the business themselves, securing victory in stoppage time when Boly fired home at the back post.",

It\u2019s too early to talk of must-win game for anyone, though Wolves could do with at least a draw in Turkey after their disappointing defeat to Braga in the opening game.

Alkmaar are a good side, only one point behind Ajax and PSV in the Eredivisie, and are generously priced to win this game.

      "bodyText": "And that\u2019s all from me. It was a disappointing early evening for Manchester United and Rangers, an excellent later evening for Arsenal and Celtic, and there was plenty of other fun including some drone-related madness in Luxembourg. Bye! Unai Emery is dead chuffed: Proud for the players ... I think we did a lot of things good ... I think it\u2019s good. But also: I think we can improve, some moments to keep the ball, more long possession, and also better positioning of attacking players. He says all this in an indistinct second-language mumble, mainly while staring blankly at his interviewer\u2019s shoes. Here\u2019s Sachin Nakrani on Arsenal\u2019s comfortable cruise against Standard Liege: For Unai Emery this was an occasion to both savour his work and question himself. The Arsenal manager quite rightly took great delight in seeing his team maintain a perfect start to their Europa League campaign in rampant fashion but it hardly did his reputation as a judge of players much good that the man who got two of Arsenal\u2019s four goals against Standard Li\u00e8ge is someone Emery does not feel has what it takes to be a striker. That was Emery\u2019s assertion of Gabriel Martinelli before this game yet he will now have to have a rethink. The 18-year-old, who arrived from the Brazilian side Ituano in the summer, scored two goals of high-quality, adding to the two he got against Nottingham Forest in the Carabao Cup last month, and throughout looked a real threat from a centre-forward position. If he cannot make it as a goalscorer then it is hard to see who can. Much more here: Ewan Murray has filed his report on Celtic\u2019s 2-0 win over Cluj: Celtic exacted the perfect revenge on Cluj, architects of their Champions League downfall, with a victory every bit as comprehensive as the scoreline suggests. Neil Lennon, the Celtic manager, retains legitimate aspirations of progression from Group E; the Europa League has given the Scottish champions scope to develop. Dan Petrescu, Lennon\u2019s opposite number, missed pre-match media duties after falling ill at a Glasgow hotel. The former Chelsea defender recovered sufficiently to bark instructions from the bench, even if nothing Petrescu witnessed would have raised his spirits. Celtic were superior in every department. Much more here: Joe Willock is extremely enthusiastic: The manager drills into us to keep on going, even if it\u2019s 3-0 or 4-0. We have to keep on pressing and try to score goals, so that\u2019s what we try to do. It\u2019s very exciting because we have a manager who wants to play youngsters. You just have to take every opportunity, try to work hard and try to make a difference. It\u2019s so exciting at the moment. Here\u2019s Hector Bellerin on Martinelli: He\u2019s kept his head down, he\u2019s worked very hard, he\u2019s listened to the coaches, he\u2019s listened to the players and it shows on the pitch. He\u2019s doing what the coaches ask him to do which is the most important thing, and he\u2019s still very young. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a lot more to come from him. On the subject of Dudelange, it turned out Luxembourg\u2019s sports minister, Dan Kersch, was in the ground tonight and he took to the microphone amid the first-half drone-related chaos to appeal for calm and apologise on behalf of his country. Meanwhile Paul Philipp, president of the Luxembourg FA, sniffed that \u201csport doesn\u2019t exist to make political statements\u201d. It\u2019s all going wrong for Dudelange, down to 10 men after Mickael Garos got shown a second yellow card with half an hour to play, and now Dani Quintana has put Qarabag 4-0 up. Celtic are top of Group E after two games, after beating the only side to win their first group game, and doing it in some style. Arsenal\u2019s romp to victory over substandard Liege is complete! Martinelli never completed his hat-trick, but he did some extremely fine work tonight. Trabzonspor\u2019s lead over Basel lasted for precisely two minutes, the time it took Noah Okafor to equalise for the Swiss side. Arsenal are in a semi-permanent state of almost-scoring at the moment. Somehow Standard are holding out. Martinelli creates another good chance for Arsenal. This time Torreira\u2019s shot hits a defender. A couple of key goals to report: in Celtic\u2019s Group E Lazio have come from behind to now lead Rennes 2-1, CIro Immobile with their latest. And in Group C Trabzonspor have precisely matched them, coming back to now lead Basel 2-1, Jose Sosa with their second. And they could have scored a fifth! Martinelli is again the inspiration, running into the left of the area and pulling back to Pepe, whose shot hits a defender. Arsenal have brought on Aubameyang in place of Nelson, for 10 minutes or so of full-throttle goal-sniffing. A couple of goals have been pulled back: At Krasnodar, Ferreira Ari has made it 1-2 with 20 minutes to play, and at Rosenborg Samuel Adegbenro has made it 1-3. Another goal at Lazio, where Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, whose brother Vanja is keeping goal for Standard Liege at Arsenal this evening, has equalised for the home side. 1-1 now! A couple of other goals to tell you about: Markus Rosenberg has equalised for Malmo at home to Copenhagen, and Sporting have scored twice in five minutes to now lead LASK 2-1. Elsewhere in Celtic\u2019s Group E, Rennes have taken the lead at Lazio, where Jeremy Morel has made it 0-1. Forrest bursts down the right, gets into the area, waits for Elyounoussi to arrive in support and then passes to him on the edge of the area. He shoots across the keeper but it deflects off a defender and goes the other way, rolling just inside the post! Ceballos scores his first goal for Arsenal, with Martinelli this time getting the assist! Played in on the right of the area he chips the ball over the keeper, and it might even have gone in and become one of the all-time most glorious keeper-chipping goals had Ceballos not turned it over the line (or a defender hooked it clear). Ooof! Martinelli gets his studs on Nelson\u2019s low cross, but can\u2019t divert it into the net! Apparently the Dudelange-Qarabag match has not been postponed, merely interrupted. According to a report on Luxembourgois website l\u2019Essentiel, the drone \u201cangered Azeri players and fans\u201d, some fans invaded the field and some Qarabag players started fighting, though who with is not clear. The drone\u2019s owner eventually guided it back to him on a nearby roof and scarpered, allowing the game to restart after a half-hourish stoppage. Qarabag are now 3-0 up, with the game approaching half-time. Peeeeep! The second half has begun at Arsenal. And some other places, probably. Jon Tumbridge is as close as I\u2019ve got to an eyewitness. \u201cA friend in Baku tells me that the Qarabag match has been suspended, as a drone with a \u2018Qarabag Republic\u2019 flag has been flown over the stadium,\u201d he writes. \u201cBoth teams are off, they have found the pilot and the local plod are having a chat with the miscreant.\u201d All your half-time scores! Group A Sevilla 1-0 APOEL Dudelange P-P Qarabag Group B Lugano 0-0 Dynamo Kyiv Malm\u00f6 0-1 Cobenhagen Group C Krasnodar 0-1 Getafe Trabzonspor 1-1 Basel Group D Rosenborg 0-3 PSV Sporting 0-1 LASK Group E Celtic 1-0 Cluj Lazio 0-0 Rennes Group F Vitoria Guimar\u00e3es 0-1 Eintracht Frankfurt Arsenal 3-0 Standard Li\u00e8ge Crazy scenes. And also quite puzzling. A drone carrying an Armenian flag hovered over the centre circle, and the referee eventually decided that he could not guarantee the players\u2019 safety. Mad scenes at Dudelange, where the match has been abandoned, apparently because of a drone invasion! A puzzling non-penalty decision at Arsenal, where Nelson is played through, nicks the ball away from the advancing keeper and is then clattered. The referee waves play on. The Cluj striker Mario Rond\u00f3n has been booked at Celtic Park for a particularly egregious dive. In Arsenal\u2019s Group F, Eintracht Frankfurt are 1-0 up in Guimaraes, Obite Ndicka scoring. And PSV have scored a second goal in four minutes, Donyell Malen making it 3-0 at Rosenborg. PSV Eindhoven have doubled their advantage in Rosenborg, their full-back Denzel Dumfries scoring with eight minutes to play in this first half. Goals are flying in everywhere now. In Group C, Silvan Widmer gave Basel the lead at Trabzonspor in the 20th minute but Parmak has since equalised. There have only been two shots on target in that game, so that\u2019s top-notch chance conversion. Meanwhile at Krasnodar, Rodriguez Angel has just given Getafe a 1-0 lead. This was, I\u2019m told, the first time in the entire recorded history of all time that Manchester United have played a Europa League game without mustering so much as a single shot on target. Paul Doyle meanwhile was at Vodafone Park to see Wolves snatch victory over Besiktas through Willy Boly\u2019s stoppage-time strike. Wolves kickstarted their Europa League group stage campaign thanks to a stoppage-time goal by Wily Boly, who turned in a cross by R\u00faben Nevez to secure a memorable victory in Turkey. Wolves won all three of their away matches in the preliminary stages of this competition and Boly\u2019s goal ensured this match ended up as the perfect way to atone for the home defeat by Braga in their first group game. Much more here: Paul Wilson has filed his match report from the Kyocera Stadium, site of Manchester United\u2019s latest underwhelming away day: Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r is still looking for his first away win as Manchester United\u2019s permanent manager. Newcastle on Sunday would seem an inviting opportunity but Solskj\u00e6r is going to have to alter his team and his tactics to have any hope of beating even demoralised opponents. This was just as presentable a chance to turn a corner, yet a United side sorely lacking in ambition and creativity were unable to take it, merely adapting to AZ Alkmaar\u2019s level and in the end being quite fortunate to escape with a draw. Much more here: Cluj have the ballo in the net at Celtic! But as Boli wheels away to celebrate he sees the linesman\u2019s flag is raised, and it does appear that Rond\u00f3n was six inches offside when Forster shovelled the ball straight into his path. Arsenal have a third! Nelson\u2019s shot from outside the area hits a defender and deflects to Willock, who takes a touch to control before shooting across the keeper and in! That\u2019s a super goal! A lovely ball through to Bolingoli, and he does brilliantly to catch it before it goes out of play and dink a cross to Edouard, who can hardly miss! And two in Group A, where Qarabag are a goal up at Dudelange while Sevilla are beating Apoel Nicosia. Meanwhile at Celtic, Forrest somehow fails to find Edouard with a pull-back. Two goals to report in Group D, where PSV have taken the lead at Rosenborg through Pablo Rosario, and LASK are 1-0 up at Sporting, thanks to Marko Raguz. And another one! This is so, so smart from Martinelli, who has the ball in the area on his left foot and looks set to head for the byline but suddenly changes his mind, checks back, and curls a right-footed shot inside the far post! A fine, long pass from right to left, Tierney\u2019s cross picks out Martinelli right on the corner of the six-yard box. That was a tough chance, but he flashes his header past Milinkovic-Savic and in! Twelve games. Ten minutes. No goals. Celtic have just come extremely close, though, only for Arlauskis to save. Arsenal have started brightly. Willock gets into the area, but a defender flings out a foot to divert the ball into touch, off the Arsenal player. BONG! The clock strikes eight, and they\u2019re off! Hello everyone! But a few moments away from kick-off in this evening\u2019s 8pm matches. Quite a few empty seats at Arsenal, I see. That\u2019s it from me. Simon Burnton is waiting eagerly to be tagged in for the 8pm kick-offs. You can get in touch with him by emailing simon.burnton@theguardian.com or tweeting @Simon_Burnton. Night!

Willy Boly scored the winner in injury time, a very calm finish after he was left alone in the area. That\u2019s a bad result for Rangers. The winning goal was a terrible one to concede. James Tavernier missed an attempted interception, and then Christian Fassnacht\u2019s shot went through the hand of the diving Allan McGregor. Wolves have nicked it! That\u2019s a decent result for Manchester United. But the game was crap, and United didn\u2019t have a single shot on target. A sickener for Rangers! AZ Alkmaar 0-0 Manchester United Jesse Lingard has gone off the field with a hamstring injury, so United are down to 10 men. United\u2019s injury list is brutal. Besiktas 0-0 Wolves Roman Saiss has had a late goal disallowed for offside. I think it was the right decision, though I\u2019d like to see another replay.

With five minutes to go, there have been none.\u201d AZ Alkmaar 0-0 Manchester United This would be a good result for United, even if their attacking performance has been pretty lamentable. AZ Alkmaar 0-0 Manchester United Lingard misses a good chance, flashing a shot just wide after a smart pass from the substitute Scott McTominay. \u201cI\u2019m wondering what you make of Man Utd\u2019s youth prospects?\u201d says Rajiv. \u201cMuch has been made about them, maybe mostly by Solskjaer, but I honestly can\u2019t see much of a future for them at a big club outside of James.\u201d Greenwood looks a cert to me and should be starting in the Premier League. I don\u2019t think Chong will make it at United; I haven\u2019t seen enough of Gomes, though he clearly has a lot of class. Rashford, who I thought would become a superstar after his performances in 2016, is regressing. The other one to watch is James Garner, who by all accounts is a terrific midfielder. AZ Alkmaar 0-0 Manchester United Rashford goes down in the area after being clipped by the sliding Wuytens. That should have been a penalty, but the referee was unsighted and the assistant wasn\u2019t interested. AZ Alkmaar 0-0 Manchester United This United team have forgotten how to shoot, never mind score. Mind you, once upon a time it was even worse under Sir Alex Ferguson. In April 1989, United scored once in five games - and that was an own-goal from Tony Adams.

Jesse Lingard has gone into the false 10 role, just behind Rashford. AZ Alkmaar 0-0 Manchester United Idrissi swishes a lovely shot just wide of the far post from 20 yards. AZ are starting to put United under increasing pressure. Here comes Jesse Lingard, on for Mason Greenwood. He had an anonymous game, mainly because nobody gave him the ball. AZ Alkmaar 0-0 Manchester United Fred puts hands on de Wit, who goes down in the area. The referee ignores AZ\u2019s penalty appeals, and there\u2019s no VAR. That could easily have been given, even though de Wit made a meal of it. AZ Alkmaar 0-0 Manchester United David de Gea makes an acrobatic save, pushing away a long-range shot from Wijndal. That\u2019s AZ\u2019s third shot on target; United have had the square root of eff all. GOAL! Sporting Braga 2-1 Slovan Bratislava Braga are back in front through Galeno. AZ Alkmaar 0-0 Manchester United The service to Mason Greenwood has been abysmal. He had a decent chance in the first half, when his snapshot was blocked by Vlaar, but that\u2019s all. \u201cThat crop of Arsenal youngsters is awesome,\u201d says Bill Hargreaves. \u201cAnd that\u2019s minus one Serge Gnabry. I hope they manage to fulfil their potential. On which subject: how much of top-level coaching is bringing on talent, how much getting the tactics right, how much motivating the team, and how much touchline attire?\u201d We all know the answer to that.

Yep, it\u2019s time for Matchday 2 of the Europa League, with 24 games in all. It\u2019s too early to talk of must-win game for anyone, though Wolves could do with at least a draw in Turkey after their disappointing defeat to Braga in the opening game. And Manchester United would like to win in the Netherlands to take a bit of heat off Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, whose pitiful inability to instantly turn someone else\u2019s sow\u2019s ear into a silk purse has been exposed. The storm damage to Alkmaar\u2019s home ground means the match will be played on a synthetic pitch at ADO Den Haag\u2019s ground. Alkmaar are a good side, only one point behind Ajax and PSV in the Eredivisie, and are generously priced to win this game. We\u2019ll have team news for all the 5.55pm kick-offs any minute now.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Friday 4 October. Top stories Scott Morrison has declared that sovereign countries need to eschew an \u201cunaccountable internationalist bureaucracy\u201d and the world needs to avoid \u201cnegative globalism\u201d in a major foreign policy lecture at the Lowy Institute. A week after Donald Trump used a speech to the UN to declare the future belonged to patriots, Morrison echoed the US president\u2019s tone, telling the foreign policy thinktank \u201conly a national government, especially one accountable through the ballot box and the rule of law, can define its national interests\u201d. Trump has called on China to investigate Joe Biden, his leading political rival, in defiance of impeachment proceedings in Congress where he stands accused of abusing his office to put similar pressure on Ukraine. At the same time, Trump noted that the US was in trade talks with China and \u201cif they don\u2019t do what we want, we have tremendous, tremendous power\u201d. Asked if he had asked Xi Jinping to start an investigation, he said: \u201cI haven\u2019t, but it\u2019s certainly something we can start thinking about.\u201d The European parliament has told Boris Johnson that his proposals for the Irish border do not \u201ceven remotely\u201d amount to an acceptable deal for the EU, in comments echoed by Ireland\u2019s PM. Jean-Claude Juncker has called on the British government to publish its Brexit plan in full after Johnson faced accusations from Leo Varadkar of misleading parliament. MEPs said Johnson\u2019s proposals could not form the basis for an agreement, describing them as a \u201clast-minute\u201d effort. The European parliament will have a veto on any withdrawal deal. Contaminated water has been discovered spilling from a luxury Gold Coast estate into an internationally important wetland site, amid a broader investigation into an unfolding \u201cenvironmental catastrophe\u201d in the once-pristine waterway. On Thursday the Gold Coast council notified the Queensland environment department that a \u201cprivate recycled water main\u201d at the Serenity Cove site had broken. Guardian Australia understands the contamination is likely to be grey water, which authorities advise has the potential to turn septic or breed micro-organisms. World An employee at Paris\u2019s police headquarters has stabbed and killed four colleagues before being shot dead. The victims were three male police officers from the anti-terrorist department and a female administrator in the public security department. Hong Kong\u2019s leader plans to use harsh colonial-era emergency powers for the first time, banning face masks in an attempt to curb the city\u2019s protests. Opposition politicians warned it represented a slide towards authoritarianism. Northern Ireland\u2019s near-blanket abortion ban breaches the UK\u2019s human rights commitments, the high court in Belfast has ruled. The decision, on Thursday, was made in a case brought by Sarah Ewart, 29, who was denied a termination despite a scan showing the foetus she was carrying would not survive. Palaeontologists have found the fossilised partial skeleton of a new winged dinosaur species capable of crossing continents. The pterosaur may have lived about 90m years ago. It was named Ferrodraco lentoni \u2013 or \u201cButch\u2019s Iron Dragon\u201d. Scotland has become the first country in the UK to ban the physical punishment of children, making it a criminal offence for parents to smack their offspring. . Sport Dyed green sausages, hordes of bouncing fans and a giant Viking horn on the back of a truck: Canberra has seen it all this week as it gears up to get behind the Raiders in the NRL grand final. It isn\u2019t Super Rugby but, with 24 players figuring in Japan, the Canterbury club is having a big say, writes Matt McILraith.

      "bodyText": "There are more than 1,000 confirmed or probable cases of vaping-related lung injury across the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Thursday, including 18 deaths. Most of the cases involved young men who said they had a history of using liquids that contained tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the ingredient that gives marijuana its high. The CDC said there were 1080 cases reported in 48 states and the US Virgin Islands as of 1 October, a 275-case increase from last week. The CDC principal deputy director, Dr Anne Schuchat, said cases were \u201ccontinuing at a brisk pace\u201d but cautioned that the increase from last week was a combination of new patients and recent reporting of previously identified patients. Of those found to have the lung injury, which can cause severe shortness of breath, fatigue and chest pain, 70% were male and 80% were under 35 years old. Schuchat told Congress last week that 100 people were investigating the injuries, but the government officials had not determined what caused the outbreak. In the meantime, the CDC recommends US consumers avoid all vaping products \u2013 especially products containing THC and bought off the street. In a first-of-its-kind study published this week, Mayo Clinic researchers said the deaths from vaping-related injury could be caused by a mix of \u201ctoxic chemical fumes\u201d.

Fate could yet intervene, clearly, but Jones could not have asked for much more before a fixture that has been circled in his diary for over two years. Beat the Pumas and, to some degree, England can relax, safe in the knowledge their knockout qualification is assured for the first time in eight years. There will inevitably be some idle teahouse chatter about whether they would be better finishing second in Pool C and potentially avoiding Australia and New Zealand in the quarters and semis but, equally, arriving in the last eight with gathering momentum and an unbeaten pool record would hardly be the worst outcome.</p> \n<p>While Jones is making dutiful noises about fully respecting Argentina, he also knows this would be a good moment to make a real statement against opponents who have not looked as threatening as usual at this World Cup. It would also nip in the bud <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/01/england-are-boring-says-argentina-hooker-rugby-world-cup\" title=\"\">the \u201cboring\u201d England narrative </a>with which Jones is entirely familiar, having previously seen another former Wallaby coach Bob Dwyer employ it successfully prior to the 1991 World Cup final.</p> \n<p>England\u2019s pack were more than a match for anyone but that day, instead, the team chose to adopt a more open style which ultimately backfired. \u201cIt is the old two-card trick,\u201d Jones said, grinning. \u201cBob Dwyer threw that one out there in 1991 and there was a response. Maybe if England hadn\u2019t played like that they would have two World Cups on their sleeves.\u201d</p> \n<p>There is more than one way, in other words, to skin a Puma and Jones has long been working on ways to maximise this current England side\u2019s strengths. Above all else he wants his players to be crystal clear about the gameplan, dynamic with and without the ball, supremely fit and flexible enough to keep up with international rugby\u2019s latest trends. In this tournament, given the frequently slippery ball and the reluctance of referees to ping every single ruck offence, it pays to have a range of different kicking options and, in particular, a mobile threat at the breakdown.</p> \n<p>Hence the return to the George Ford-Owen Farrell axis at 10 and 12, with Elliot Daly\u2019s left boot in reserve and both Tom Curry and Sam Underhill in the starting back row. \u201cI feel the game has moved into another cycle of contestability,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThe referees want low penalty counts and when you have low penalty counts, that means you have a highly contested breakdown and more kicking. We just thought: how can we be best equipped in that area? Argentina have gone for big, tall, carrying back-rowers. We have got one big carrying No 8 between two industrious players at six and seven.

Mario Rond\u00f3n had the ball in the hosts\u2019 net, only for the goal to be ruled out for offside. The Cluj striker was subsequently booked for diving, having toppled under pressure from Ryan Christie inside the Celtic penalty area. If this competition is the poor relation of the Champions League, someone has forgotten to tell the Celtic support. A packed stadium took in this fixture and the fans were back on their feet within 15 minutes of the restart. Mohamed Elyounoussi showed tenacity to retrieve the ball in midfield, with the Southampton loanee feeding James Forrest. Elyounoussi\u2019s desire to maraud forward was similarly impressive; he collected Forrest\u2019s return pass before slotting home Celtic\u2019s second, albeit with the aid of a deflection. \u201cWe knew to win here again would be very hard,\u201d Petrescu said. \u201cCeltic have better players than us.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>An NHS cancer hospital has such crumbling buildings, out-of-date equipment and staffing problems that patients\u2019 safety and quality of care are at risk, a bombshell report for health service bosses has warned.</p> <p>Patients at the Mount Vernon Cancer Centre who are acutely unwell or dying are receiving substandard care because it lacks the medical expertise and facilities needed to manage them properly, and its services need to be moved, an inquiry has found.</p> <p>Mount Vernon in Hillingdon, north-west London, is one of the NHS\u2019s specialist cancer hospitals, along with London\u2019s Royal Marsden and the Christie in Manchester.</p> <p>The impending loss of most or all of Mount Vernon\u2019s services will be of concern to Boris Johnson, as his Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency is nearby. Voters in the seat are among the 2 million people in London, Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire and Berkshire for whom Mount Vernon is their nearest specialist cancer centre.</p> <p>However, despite its decrepit physical infrastructure, it is not one of the six hospitals the prime minister this week said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/29/boris-johnson-makes-13bn-hospital-pledge-as-tory-party-conference-looms\">would be rebuilt</a> over the next five years with a \u00a32.7bn injection of NHS capital funding.</p> <p>The 117-year-old London hospital is so dilapidated and short of doctors and nurses that it cannot provide modern cancer care or even basic elements of treatment such as consultants undertaking daily ward rounds, new inpatients being reviewed within 14 hours of arrival and rapid access to diagnostic testing and their results.</p> <p>The group of experts who undertook the urgent review on behalf of NHS bosses have concluded that Mount Vernon has been neglected for so long that it can no longer operate safely as an important regional centre of cancer care, is unviable and as a result its services need to be moved and rebuilt from scratch elsewhere.</p> <p>\u201cMaintaining safety of patients cannot be guaranteed in the near future. Status quo is not an option. There is a need for urgent action. Current estate is not fit for purpose, particularly ward buildings for acutely unwell and end of life inpatients,\u201d the report says.</p> <p>Leaking roofs have forced Mount Vernon\u2019s management to move some services from one part of the hospital to another, the 34-page report reveals. The wards containing its 37 inpatient beds \u2013 where people are treated for complications of cancer or recover from radiotherapy or chemotherapy or are in their last days \u2013 are in \u201cvery poor\u201d condition. And its lack of an intensive care or high dependency unit and operating theatres means that \u201clarge numbers\u201d of patients have to be transferred from Mount Vernon to other hospitals because it is unable to look after the very sick.</p> <p>\u201cMuch of the existing estate used by MVCC is dilapidated and not fit for purpose,\u201d the report says. An \u201curgent backlog maintenance of existing clinical facilities\u201d needs to be tackled.</p> <p>Its lack of staff has become \u201ccritical\u201d and means that some patients are not getting helped by a nurse who specialises in their form of cancer. Shortages are being exacerbated by an exodus of experienced doctors and nurses.</p> <p>The report found: \u201cStaff losses are impacting upon the service. There are additional clinical risks such as the backlog of patient letters and notes as a result of inadequate administrative support.</p> <p>\u201cRecruitment and retention of expert staff is an increasing problem and is becoming critical.\u201d In addition, personnel \u201care, in the main, demoralised and frustrated\u201d over the hospital\u2019s uncertain future.</p> <p>It is thought to be the first time in the NHS\u2019s 71-year history that a major facility specialising in the country\u2019s second biggest killer disease has been deemed to pose a risk to patients and been declared unfit for purpose.</p> <p>Cancer charities said the hospital\u2019s shortcomings were \u201cdeeply worrying\u201d and reflect the serious workforce shortages and reliance on old equipment that are increasingly common in NHS cancer services after almost a decade of austerity funding of the health service.</p> <p>\u201cTime after time we\u2019ve heard about staff shortages causing crises in NHS cancer services, and this is yet more evidence of the unbearable pressure on the system,\u201d said Matt Case, Cancer Research UK\u2019s policy manager.</p> <p>\u201cRecent government commitments to investing in NHS buildings and equipment are a welcome first step, but must be met by significant investment in cancer staff, or stories like this will continue to emerge and cancer patients will not receive the care that they deserve.\u201d</p> <p>Prof Nick Slevin, a consultant clinical oncologist at the Christie hospital, led the clinical advisory panel of experts which undertook the urgent review in May at the request of NHS England\u2019s east of England region.</p> <p>Slevin states in the report that it was undertaken because \u201cacute support services have been progressively depleted on the site over many years such that there is current and increasing concern regarding patient safety\u201d.</p> <p>He adds: \u201cServices continue to be provided within very poor quality accommodation with much equipment reaching the end of its life without a replacement plan.\u201d For example, one linear accelerator (linacs) machine used to deliver radiotherapy has been temporarily upgraded so the hospital can continue using it because it cannot afford to buy a new one.</p> <p>Other problems highlighted by the panel\u2019s report include:</p> <ul> <li><p>Information technology and electronic patient record systems are so poor that they constitute \u201ca clinical risk\u201d.</p></li> <li><p>Staff provide excellent care in difficult circumstances but are struggling due to \u201cexcess workload\u201d.</p></li> <li><p>Doctors cannot access the results of CT and MRI scans out of hours.</p></li> <li><p>Delays of up to six weeks in typing up letters detailing patients\u2019 latest condition means that nurses staffing Mount Vernon\u2019s 24-hour telephone chemotherapy advice line may inadvertently give wrong advice.</p></li> </ul> <p>The experts have recommended that Mount Vernon is either replaced in full beside an acute hospital, or that that happens but some radiotherapy and chemotherapy services remain on the existing site.</p> <p>With Mount Vernon\u2019s days numbered, three major London NHS trusts \u2013 the Marsden, University College London Hospitals and Imperial College Healthcare \u2013 as well as Addenbrooke\u2019s hospital in Cambridge \u2013 are interested in its replacement being built on their site. Whichever gets it will take over running it from East and North Hertfordshire trust.</p> <p>Gwyneth Tyler, Macmillan Cancer Support\u2019s head of services for south and east England, said: \u201cThe findings from the recent review into the Mount Vernon Cancer centre are deeply worrying. People living with cancer deserve access to the best possible care from the moment they are diagnosed and cancer centres cannot provide this without capital investment in their infrastructure and workforce.\u201d</p> <p>An NHS spokesperson said: \u201cThe review of Mount Vernon Cancer Centre is ongoing to ensure the service is able to respond to the significant advances in cancer treatment over recent decades. This includes identifying a specialist cancer provider to run the centre.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "An NHS cancer hospital has such crumbling buildings, out-of-date equipment and staffing problems that patients\u2019 safety and quality of care are at risk, a bombshell report for health service bosses has warned. Patients at the Mount Vernon Cancer Centre who are acutely unwell or dying are receiving substandard care because it lacks the medical expertise and facilities needed to manage them properly, and its services need to be moved, an inquiry has found. Mount Vernon in Hillingdon, north-west London, is one of the NHS\u2019s specialist cancer hospitals, along with London\u2019s Royal Marsden and the Christie in Manchester. The impending loss of most or all of Mount Vernon\u2019s services will be of concern to Boris Johnson, as his Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency is nearby. Voters in the seat are among the 2 million people in London, Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire and Berkshire for whom Mount Vernon is their nearest specialist cancer centre. However, despite its decrepit physical infrastructure, it is not one of the six hospitals the prime minister this week said would be rebuilt over the next five years with a \u00a32.7bn injection of NHS capital funding. The 117-year-old London hospital is so dilapidated and short of doctors and nurses that it cannot provide modern cancer care or even basic elements of treatment such as consultants undertaking daily ward rounds, new inpatients being reviewed within 14 hours of arrival and rapid access to diagnostic testing and their results. The group of experts who undertook the urgent review on behalf of NHS bosses have concluded that Mount Vernon has been neglected for so long that it can no longer operate safely as an important regional centre of cancer care, is unviable and as a result its services need to be moved and rebuilt from scratch elsewhere. \u201cMaintaining safety of patients cannot be guaranteed in the near future. Status quo is not an option. There is a need for urgent action. Current estate is not fit for purpose, particularly ward buildings for acutely unwell and end of life inpatients,\u201d the report says. Leaking roofs have forced Mount Vernon\u2019s management to move some services from one part of the hospital to another, the 34-page report reveals. The wards containing its 37 inpatient beds \u2013 where people are treated for complications of cancer or recover from radiotherapy or chemotherapy or are in their last days \u2013 are in \u201cvery poor\u201d condition. And its lack of an intensive care or high dependency unit and operating theatres means that \u201clarge numbers\u201d of patients have to be transferred from Mount Vernon to other hospitals because it is unable to look after the very sick. \u201cMuch of the existing estate used by MVCC is dilapidated and not fit for purpose,\u201d the report says. An \u201curgent backlog maintenance of existing clinical facilities\u201d needs to be tackled. Its lack of staff has become \u201ccritical\u201d and means that some patients are not getting helped by a nurse who specialises in their form of cancer. Shortages are being exacerbated by an exodus of experienced doctors and nurses. The report found: \u201cStaff losses are impacting upon the service. There are additional clinical risks such as the backlog of patient letters and notes as a result of inadequate administrative support. \u201cRecruitment and retention of expert staff is an increasing problem and is becoming critical.\u201d In addition, personnel \u201care, in the main, demoralised and frustrated\u201d over the hospital\u2019s uncertain future. It is thought to be the first time in the NHS\u2019s 71-year history that a major facility specialising in the country\u2019s second biggest killer disease has been deemed to pose a risk to patients and been declared unfit for purpose. Cancer charities said the hospital\u2019s shortcomings were \u201cdeeply worrying\u201d and reflect the serious workforce shortages and reliance on old equipment that are increasingly common in NHS cancer services after almost a decade of austerity funding of the health service. \u201cTime after time we\u2019ve heard about staff shortages causing crises in NHS cancer services, and this is yet more evidence of the unbearable pressure on the system,\u201d said Matt Case, Cancer Research UK\u2019s policy manager. \u201cRecent government commitments to investing in NHS buildings and equipment are a welcome first step, but must be met by significant investment in cancer staff, or stories like this will continue to emerge and cancer patients will not receive the care that they deserve.\u201d Prof Nick Slevin, a consultant clinical oncologist at the Christie hospital, led the clinical advisory panel of experts which undertook the urgent review in May at the request of NHS England\u2019s east of England region. Slevin states in the report that it was undertaken because \u201cacute support services have been progressively depleted on the site over many years such that there is current and increasing concern regarding patient safety\u201d. He adds: \u201cServices continue to be provided within very poor quality accommodation with much equipment reaching the end of its life without a replacement plan.\u201d For example, one linear accelerator (linacs) machine used to deliver radiotherapy has been temporarily upgraded so the hospital can continue using it because it cannot afford to buy a new one. Other problems highlighted by the panel\u2019s report include: Information technology and electronic patient record systems are so poor that they constitute \u201ca clinical risk\u201d. Staff provide excellent care in difficult circumstances but are struggling due to \u201cexcess workload\u201d. Doctors cannot access the results of CT and MRI scans out of hours. Delays of up to six weeks in typing up letters detailing patients\u2019 latest condition means that nurses staffing Mount Vernon\u2019s 24-hour telephone chemotherapy advice line may inadvertently give wrong advice. The experts have recommended that Mount Vernon is either replaced in full beside an acute hospital, or that that happens but some radiotherapy and chemotherapy services remain on the existing site. With Mount Vernon\u2019s days numbered, three major London NHS trusts \u2013 the Marsden, University College London Hospitals and Imperial College Healthcare \u2013 as well as Addenbrooke\u2019s hospital in Cambridge \u2013 are interested in its replacement being built on their site. Whichever gets it will take over running it from East and North Hertfordshire trust. Gwyneth Tyler, Macmillan Cancer Support\u2019s head of services for south and east England, said: \u201cThe findings from the recent review into the Mount Vernon Cancer centre are deeply worrying. People living with cancer deserve access to the best possible care from the moment they are diagnosed and cancer centres cannot provide this without capital investment in their infrastructure and workforce.\u201d An NHS spokesperson said: \u201cThe review of Mount Vernon Cancer Centre is ongoing to ensure the service is able to respond to the significant advances in cancer treatment over recent decades. This includes identifying a specialist cancer provider to run the centre.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Nickelback fans have responded to the use of their favorite band\u2019s music by none other than Donald Trump, the president of the United States. \u201cThey should be trending for something good, like a new album or a charity they support. Not this,\u201d said Coralee Steele, 40, one of their many ardent fans. Online, the Canadian rock band is shorthand for conservative white guys in trucker hats who still hate the ex they broke up with four years ago; and so, despite them not having released a record in two years, the internet is brimming with Nickelback memes. One such meme was circulated by Trump on Wednesday, in an apparent attempt to shift attention away from ongoing impeachment proceedings against him. \u201cLOOK AT THIS PHOTOGRAPH\u201d he tweeted, referencing a famous Nickelback song, alongside a video promoting discredited corruption claims against Democratic candidate Joe Biden. The video has since been taken off Twitter at the band\u2019s request due to copyright infringement, but it has been causing a stir with Nickelback fans. After Trump\u2019s tweet late on Wednesday, the NickelbackFans Facebook page, which has more than 30,000 followers, posted: \u201cI never believed I would say this but thank you Mr President for making Nickelback trending in the US!\u201d Steele was upset to see that the band\u2019s name was popular again \u2013 only to be the butt of some online joke. \u201cI\u2019m tired of seeing them being used as a joke, they don\u2019t deserve it nor does anyone else,\u201d she told the Guardian.

      "bodyText": "Brazilian opposition figures and human rights observers are seething after a photo emerged of the country\u2019s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, grinning and giving the thumbs up alongside a man arrested in connection with the murder of the Rio de Janeiro city councillor Marielle Franco. It was the second time the president has been photographed alongside a suspect in Brazil\u2019s most high-profile political murder in a decade. In March, a photo of Bolsonaro with \u00c9lcio Vieira de Queiroz, a former policeman accused of driving the car used in Franco\u2019s killing, circulated on social media. Queiroz\u2019s arrest appeared to support suspicion that Franco had been targeted by the paramilitary gangs known as \u201cmilitias\u201d that control large swaths of Rio and are usually made up of or commanded by active or retired police officers. \u201cAnother [suspect] who has a photo with the president. Bolsonaro\u2019s relations with the militias need to be urgently investigated,\u201d tweeted Guilherme Boulos, a leftwing politician. The journalist Glenn Greenwald, a friend of Franco, tweeted: \u201cNone of this means Bolsonaro was involved in Marielle\u2019s assassination. That is unlikely. But it shows how intertwined, multi-pronged &amp; close are the Bolsonaro Family\u2019s ties to militias.\u201d Franco, a popular socialist councillor and rising star in Rio politics who fought against police brutality in the city\u2019s favelas, was killed last year with her driver Anderson Gomes when a gunman sprayed the car they were driving in. Josinaldo Lucas Freitas, a martial arts instructor, was arrested on Thursday. He is accused of disposing of the guns used in the murder by throwing them in the sea. Soon after his arrest, two photos of him posing with Bolsonaro and one with the president\u2019s Rio councillor son Carlos were published by the conservative-leaning weekly magazine Veja. \u201cThis demands an answer,\u201d said Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Costa, founder of the Rio NGO Rio de Paz (Rio of Peace). \u201cThe president must explain to the public what kind of relationship he had with this guy.\u201d Three others were also arrested on Thursday morning, including the wife of Ronnie Lessa; a former special forces police captain and alleged leader of a gang of contract killers. Lessa is accused of firing the fatal shots and is awaiting trial in a federal prison. But it remains unclear who ordered the assassination. \u201cWe continue to follow the development of the investigations and, still, with great concern about the delay in discovering the intellectual authors of the crime,\u201d Jurema Werneck, executive director of Amnesty International Brazil, wrote in a press note.",

      "bodyText": "Jean-Claude Juncker has called on the British government to publish its Brexit plan in full after Boris Johnson was accused by Ireland\u2019s prime minister of misleading parliament over the impact on the Irish border. The move came on a dramatic day during which Johnson\u2019s hopes of securing a deal by the time of a crunch summit appeared to unravel: The European parliament\u2019s Brexit steering group insisted the UK proposals did not \u201ceven remotely\u201d amount to an acceptable deal for the EU. Donald Tusk, the European council president, said Brussels was \u201cunconvinced\u201d by Johnson\u2019s plans, and offered the EU\u2019s full solidarity with Ireland amid claims that Dublin was under pressure to compromise. The EU agreed to set David Frost, the prime minister\u2019s chief negotiator, a deadline of one week to offer fresh solutions on the key sticking points. Arlene Foster, leader of the Democratic Unionist party, which has given its backing to Johnson\u2019s plans, insisted that the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, would \u201cgo down in history as the man that instituted a hard border on the island of Ireland\u201d if he failed to swallow the UK\u2019s proposals. Johnson\u2019s plans for a whistle-stop tour of EU capitals was put in peril after failing to fix meetings with both the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and Emmanuel Macron, the president of France, due to \u201cscheduling problems\u201d. Juncker\u2019s call came after the European commission president spoke on the phone to Varadkar. He then issued a statement saying the two men agreed that the UK should open the legal text tabled on Wednesday to public scrutiny. The UK has so far only made public a seven-page explanatory document on its proposals. The government has insisted that the full 44-page legal text given to the European commission be kept confidential. \u201cBoth the president and the taoiseach agreed that they would be in favour of the UK publishing the legal text of their proposal,\u201d a statement from the commission said. A senior EU diplomat said: \u201cWe want transparency and openness now \u2013 let\u2019s stop playing hide and seek.\u201d A UK source said: \u201cIt is perfectly normal for proposed legal texts to remain confidential during detailed negotiations.\u201d The extraordinary intervention by the two leaders reveals the plummeting level of trust with Downing Street amid fears the prime minister is merely seeking to blame Brussels for a failure to find a deal. Earlier in the day, Varadkar had queried Johnson\u2019s response in the Commons to a question from the former cabinet minister Damian Green, a close ally of Theresa May. The prime minister had insisted that a customs border on the island of Ireland would \u201cabsolutely not\u201d require new infrastructure for checks and controls. \u201cI am reassured by what Prime Minister Johnson said today: that he is not proposing that there should be any new physical infrastructure on the island of Ireland linked to customs or customs checks \u2013 but that is actually in contradiction to the papers presented by the UK government yesterday,\u201d Varadkar told reporters. \u201cI don\u2019t fully understand how we can have Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in a separate customs unions and somehow avoid there being tariffs and checks and customs posts between north and south.\u201d In a further barbed comment, Varadkar suggested the British public had changed its mind on Brexit but was being prevented from having its voice heard. \u201cAll the polls since Mr Johnson became prime minister suggest that\u2019s what the British people actually want, but their political system is not able to give them that choice,\u201d he said. The government has proposed that the whole of the UK leaves the EU\u2019s customs territory but that Northern Ireland stays in the EU\u2019s single market for goods if the Northern Ireland assembly at Stormont agrees in a vote before the end of the transition period, and then every four years. During a briefing of member state\u2019s ambassadors on Thursday evening, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, gave a damning critique of the proposals, telling the diplomats that it was difficult to see a deal emerging in the next 10 days unless the British \u201cfundamentally amend their position\u201d, according to EU sources. Brussels has consistently stressed the agreement must be complete before leaders attend a crunch EU summit on 17 October. \u201cYou can\u2019t just get to the European council and just say \u2018here is the text, take it or leave it,\u2019\u201d an official said. At the meeting, Barnier was withering about Johnson\u2019s characterisation of the border as a question of technicalities. The EU negotiator stressed that peace in Ireland and the all-Ireland economy were at stake.

He has known me since I was eight and he\u2019s had such a part to play in who I am as a woman today.\u201d Meanwhile Seb Coe has predicted that Asher-Smith will become the \u201cposter child\u201d for the British team at next year\u2019s Olympics providing she keeps her focus. Coe, president of the International Association of Athletics Federations, said: \u201cIt\u2019s only a short time in your career where you know you will probably win \u2013 and the rest of the field know that \u2013 and she looks like she has entered that period. \u201cCareers can sometimes be brutally short but if she can combine a world championship win with an Olympic title it puts her in the top handful of performers. \u201cThere are athletes who love the championships environment. They are trout going up stream. She looks like she is really enjoying it.\u201d When asked what advice he would give her, Coe was clear. \u201cDon\u2019t screw around with too many variables, do what you are doing, don\u2019t introduce new things. If it is working let it be. Keep the continuity. She is going into the next season as the poster child of our Games next year. I cannot think of anybody else who will so easily fit that bill.\u201d However, Coe said Asher-Smith had to be careful not to get distracted by the celebrity circuit. \u201cShe will have to be buried away in training and get that balance,\u201d he said. \u201cShe has a heightened awareness of what she can do in the sport. We have chatted about that on various occasions. \u201cI hope for her own self she is a little bit selfish and doesn\u2019t feel a responsibility to go to everything. She will figure it out, she is smart.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Council officers in the north-east London constituency of the Labour MP Stella Creasy have removed a poster showing an aborted foetus, put up by an anti-abortion group running a campaign against her. The activists, who had placed the poster in Walthamstow town square on Thursday morning, were served with a community protection notice by officers, who said members of the public had been offended by it. The advertising agency Clear Channel had apologised for running the campaign against Creasy by an anti-abortion group, which also included a billboard in Walthamstow featuring a foetus and the words \u201cStop Stella\u201d. In July, MPs approved an amendment by Creasy to extend abortion rights to Northern Ireland, the only part of the UK where it remains illegal. The MP, who is the target of a campaign by the UK branch of the American anti-abortion organisation the Centre for Bio-Ethical Reform, described the council officers as \u201ctotal heroes\u201d on Twitter. Footage posted on Facebook by the activists showed the moment when one of the council officers read out a community protection notice obliging them to remove the poster. He was heard saying the council would use bylaws, applying to the town square, which prohibited the banner from being there. On Monday, someone covered part of the billboard, which was also part of the campaign against Creasy, with white paint. Clare Coghill, the leader of Waltham Forest council, said the authority had received numerous complaints from members of the public about the campaign and \u201chad responded proportionately, having due regard to the right to protest and safety and wellbeing of all our residents and visitors\u201d.

      "bodyText": "An Indonesian journalist hit in the face by a rubber bullet during protests in Hong Kong has been permanently blinded in one eye, her lawyer has said, in what is the most serious injury among members of the media since the movement began in June. There are growing concerns about the threat to journalists from the escalating violence, and an increasingly hostile climate that saw one reporter arrested on Tuesday, after several others were injured by police and one by protesters in a day of chaotic violence. All were wearing high-visibility jackets and \u201cpress\u201d markings. The Hong Kong Journalists Association (HKJA) on Thursday filed a judicial review against the commissioner of police and the secretary for justice over their treatment of the media, listing a pattern of \u201cobstructive tactics\u201d and \u201cunnecessary and excessive force\u201d. The legal complaint does not include violence from the past two weeks, when the most frequent and damaging attacks on journalists began. Veby Indah, the Indonesian journalist who lost the sight in one eye, was hit on Sunday, while standing with colleagues on an overpass, filming a live stream. Police opened fire towards the group from relatively short range; footage shows someone shouting a warning \u2013 \u201cHey, it\u2019s journalists on this side\u201d \u2013 but seconds later she was hit and collapsed to the ground. She was later told that damage to her right eye was irreversible. \u201cDoctors treating Ms Indah have informed her that regrettably the injury she received as a result of being shot by police, will result in permanent blindness in her right eye,\u201d her lawyer Michael Vidler said in a statement late on Wednesday. \u201cShe was informed that the pupil of her eye was ruptured by the force of the impact. The exact percentage of permanent impairment can only be assessed after surgery.\u201d The 39-year-old is an associate editor of Suara Hong Kong News, a local outlet which serves the city\u2019s Indonesian community. The HKJA said it would investigate the case. \u201cWe are particularly concerned \u2026 [because] the journalist was not in the immediate vicinity of protesters at the time of the incident, she was clearly identifiable as being a member of the press and was with a number of other journalists at the time also wearing high-visibility press markings.\u201d The \u201cone country, two systems\u201d arrangement put in place when Hong Kong returned from British colonial rule to Chinese sovereignty protects freedom of the press, and the protests have been covered by hundreds of local and international reporters. But there are growing fears that violence and heavy-handed policing is obstructing the media. Alleged protester threats against pro-Beijing outlets are also a concern. On Tuesday several journalists were injured in \u201cday of grief\u201d protests called to mark China\u2019s national day. Pang Pui Yin, a reporter for the Chinese-language news website Local Press, was arrested by police as they dispersed protesters in Mong Kok district, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Even though he was clearly identified as a member of the press corps, police initially accused him of unlawful assembly, then bailed him after alleging that he assaulted a police officer. He has been released on bail, but the CPJ called for authorities to drop all charges, and \u201ccease harassing journalists covering protests\u201d. Journalists who were injured that day include one working for the public broadcaster RTHK, who was hit in the head with \u201csome kind of projectile\u201d. In response the outlet\u2019s English language unit withdrew all reporters from the ground. Apple Daily said a teargas canister hit one of its reporters in the stomach, and officers fired at but missed two of its team. Stand News reported several injuries, including one journalist who was hit in the face by what was thought to be a sponge-tipped round. Another was hit by a rubber bullet.

There would be relief in most UK boardrooms but it might be overwhelmed by worries about a slowing US economy, a weak eurozone and unresolved trade wars. The global economy is not in strong health.</p> <p>Michael Saunders, a member of the rate-setting committee, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2019/sep/27/chinese-factory-profits-slowdown-bank-of-england-brexit-stock-markets-oil-business-live?page=with:block-5d8db57a8f081108db9bdafc#block-5d8db57a8f081108db9bdafc\">said last week</a> the Bank may have to cut interest rates even if a no-deal Brexit is avoided. That was shocking in the sense that the current Bank rate is a mere 0.75%. But it was also unsurprising when you look elsewhere. The US Federal Reserve <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2019/sep/18/markets-uk-inflation-house-prices-brexit-fed-rate-decision-business-live\">has cut three times since last December</a> and the European Central Bank <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/12/ecb-announces-fresh-stimulus-as-eurozone-economy-falters\">launched a cuts-plus-stimulus package last month</a>. The UK is suddenly an outlier.</p> <p>A rate cut in November looks increasingly like the right move.</p> <h2>Drifting smoke at Imperial</h2> <p>Alison Cooper, chief executive of Imperial Brands, \u201cworked tirelessly\u201d, made \u201ca tremendous contribution\u201d and \u201csignificantly simplified and reshaped\u201d the tobacco company, says chairman Mark Williamson, who must believe every word because his board has paid her \u00a330m over the past nine years.</p> <p>So why is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/03/imperial-brands-alison-cooper-steps-down-as-ceo\">she out</a>? Williamson couldn\u2019t find space to explain and Cooper herself said nothing \u2013 not even a few anodyne words about fresh challenges, blah blah. Instead, investors were told it has been \u201cagreed\u201d that she will \u201cstep down\u201d once a successor can be found.</p> <p>One can only assume Cooper is less than enthused by this \u201cagreement\u201d, though one can see why it had to be made. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2019/sep/26/tobacco-giant-imperial-brands-splutters-to-a-shocking-profit-warning\">Imperial\u2019s share price has halved over the past three years</a>, a rotten performance even within a wheezing sector. Imperial\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/26/backlash-against-vaping-in-us-will-hit-profits-imperial-warns\">profits warning last week</a> was one cough too many. Investors had lost confidence.</p> <p>Cooper\u2019s looming departure creates a crush at the boardroom door. Williamson has been trying to leave since February but hasn\u2019t yet found a successor. This is probably because most of the usual chairing suspects don\u2019t want to bear the stigma of tobacco. For Cooper\u2019s replacement, the City won\u2019t want an internal candidate, meaning Imperial will have to hunt within the ranks of rivals, which also takes time.</p> <p>The real question mark hangs over Imperial\u2019s strategy. The company was late into the vaping market and looks outgunned by the likes of Philip Morris. But is it wise to invest to catch up if the market itself could be upset by a combination of US regulators, US supermarkets and even President Trump?</p> <p>As with the share price, there is a severe sense of drift at Imperial. The next chairman should start by calling time on the company\u2019s ridiculous remuneration practices.</p> <h2>Brand recognition isn\u2019t everything</h2> <p>Ted Baker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/03/ted-baker-shares-plunge-as-it-suffers-first-half-loss\">had a shocker in the first half of this year</a>, much worse than the share price, which has been on the slide for 18 months, had predicted.</p> <p>But here\u2019s its chief executive, Lindsay Page, talking heart from \u201cthe continuing strength of the brand,\u201d 20% more followers on Instagram and new \u201cmonthly product drops\u201d\".</p> <p>Great, but what about the prices of the clothes? Ted had less to say that score, which makes one think the many City sceptics are right. The brand may be well-known but it also looks too expensive in today\u2019s retail world.</p>",

There would be relief in most UK boardrooms but it might be overwhelmed by worries about a slowing US economy, a weak eurozone and unresolved trade wars. The global economy is not in strong health. Michael Saunders, a member of the rate-setting committee, said last week the Bank may have to cut interest rates even if a no-deal Brexit is avoided. That was shocking in the sense that the current Bank rate is a mere 0.75%. But it was also unsurprising when you look elsewhere. The US Federal Reserve has cut three times since last December and the European Central Bank launched a cuts-plus-stimulus package last month. The UK is suddenly an outlier. A rate cut in November looks increasingly like the right move. Drifting smoke at Imperial Alison Cooper, chief executive of Imperial Brands, \u201cworked tirelessly\u201d, made \u201ca tremendous contribution\u201d and \u201csignificantly simplified and reshaped\u201d the tobacco company, says chairman Mark Williamson, who must believe every word because his board has paid her \u00a330m over the past nine years. So why is she out? Williamson couldn\u2019t find space to explain and Cooper herself said nothing \u2013 not even a few anodyne words about fresh challenges, blah blah. Instead, investors were told it has been \u201cagreed\u201d that she will \u201cstep down\u201d once a successor can be found. One can only assume Cooper is less than enthused by this \u201cagreement\u201d, though one can see why it had to be made. Imperial\u2019s share price has halved over the past three years, a rotten performance even within a wheezing sector. Imperial\u2019s profits warning last week was one cough too many. Investors had lost confidence. Cooper\u2019s looming departure creates a crush at the boardroom door. Williamson has been trying to leave since February but hasn\u2019t yet found a successor. This is probably because most of the usual chairing suspects don\u2019t want to bear the stigma of tobacco. For Cooper\u2019s replacement, the City won\u2019t want an internal candidate, meaning Imperial will have to hunt within the ranks of rivals, which also takes time. The real question mark hangs over Imperial\u2019s strategy. The company was late into the vaping market and looks outgunned by the likes of Philip Morris. But is it wise to invest to catch up if the market itself could be upset by a combination of US regulators, US supermarkets and even President Trump? As with the share price, there is a severe sense of drift at Imperial. The next chairman should start by calling time on the company\u2019s ridiculous remuneration practices. Brand recognition isn\u2019t everything Ted Baker had a shocker in the first half of this year, much worse than the share price, which has been on the slide for 18 months, had predicted. But here\u2019s its chief executive, Lindsay Page, talking heart from \u201cthe continuing strength of the brand,\u201d 20% more followers on Instagram and new \u201cmonthly product drops\u201d\". Great, but what about the prices of the clothes? Ted had less to say that score, which makes one think the many City sceptics are right. The brand may be well-known but it also looks too expensive in today\u2019s retail world.",

The opposition leader told parliament the prime minister\u2019s plans were simply unworkable and part of a cynical attack upon workers\u2019 rights. \u201cDeal or no deal, this government\u2019s agenda is clear,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want a Trump-deal Brexit that would crash our economy and rip away the standards that put a floor under people\u2019s rights at work. \u201cNo Labour MP could support such a reckless deal that would be used as a springboard to attack rights and standards in this country.\u201d But, behind the scenes, Downing Street figures have approached Labour MPs in the hope of persuading them to vote for Johnson\u2019s proposals. If Johnson is able to get a deal through parliament by 19 October, with the support of 322 MPs, it would release him from his obligations under the so-called Benn act to seek an extension to article 50. Although parliamentary calculations will only become relevant if the EU backs the proposals, an increasing number of Labour MPs have said they are considering voting for it. John Mann, the MP for Bassetlaw who supported Theresa May\u2019s failed withdrawal deal, said he would vote for Johnson\u2019s plan and believed there were more than enough Labour votes \u201cto pass any agreed deal\u201d.

Stephen Kinnock, the Labour MP for Aberavon who successfully proposed an amendment to May\u2019s deal, has said he will wait to see how Brussels and Dublin react before commenting. The prime minister already appears to have shored up support from the DUP and hardline Eurosceptics in his own party. Steve Baker, the chairman of the European Research Group of hardline Tory Brexiters, signalled that he could back a deal. Their positions could well alter if Brussels insists on changes, as seems likely. Labour sources said that Johnson\u2019s behaviour in the chamber \u2013 when he repeatedly used phrases such as \u201csurrender\u201d and \u201cbetray\u201d \u2013 had damaged his ability to win over Labour MPs. \u201cThis deal rips up even the limited guarantees that were offered [in the May deal],\u201d one source said.",

Most artists operate on tiny margins and the prospect of extra cost and bureaucracy would kill their ability to tour, develop their talent and build their fanbase.\u201d</p> <p>Dugher said British artists were already cancelling European tours and promoters were withdrawing planned investment. In September the British musician Imogen Heap announced she was <a href=\"http://imogenheap.com/myceliatour-faq.php?\">cancelling her upcoming European tour</a>, which was due to start in early November, citing \u201cthe extreme uncertainties of travelling throughout the EU so soon after Brexit has happened\u201d.</p> <p>Mark Davyd, the head of the UK Music Venue Trust, said: \u201cIf this is the best that can be achieved then we would strongly urge the government to bring forward fully funded proposals that create centralised, accessible and free-to-use support that can enable grassroots musicians to comply with these demands.\u201d</p> <p>The issues are also expected to affect sport. The president of Uefa, Aleksander \u010ceferin, recently discussed the challenges of holding a pan-continental tournament such as Euro 2020 after Brexit. \u201cI don\u2019t think that we should organise such a big event,\u201d he said at the Uefa committee meeting in Slovenia last month. \u201cIt\u2019s symbolically very nice, it\u2019s pan-European, it\u2019s east-west, north-south, it\u2019s 60 years, but doing it every time, I would say it\u2019s too challenging.\u201d</p> <p>In the event of a no-deal Brexit, touring parties would have to check individual EU states\u2019 immigration rules for requirements regarding documentation, work permits and visas.Tourers would have to contact relevant EU countries\u2019 social security institutions to check whether they need to pay contributions locally in addition to national insurance. Additionally, the guide states that European health insurance cards may not be valid after a no-deal Brexit, necessitating the purchase of health and travel insurance.</p> <p>Anyone driving their own vehicle in the EU would require a \u201cgreen card\u201d that takes up to a month to acquire from an insurance company, plus a GB sticker and in some countries an international driving permit.</p> <p>Parties planning to run \u201cunscheduled bus or coach services\u201d in EU countries would require a standard international operator licence and a copy of the Interbus waybill. Every roundtrip passing through EU nations requires a completed waybill from the Confederation of Passenger Transport that details the entirety of a planned trip from start to finish.</p> <p>CPT\u2019s operations officer, Mark Purchase, said this would limit the ability of DIY organisations \u2013 for example, a band, small theatre company or charity hiring a minibus \u2013 to tour the EU, as international operator licences were available only to licensed bus and coach operators, not individuals.</p> <p>Purchase said anyone attempting to tour EU states without an international operator\u2019s licence may face fines. He recalled a spate of instances this year in which British operators attempted to tour Belgium with incomplete waybills, incurring fines of \u20ac900 (\u00a3799).</p> <p>Ian McCoid, the general manager of leading Hull-based tour bus company MM Band Services, said these measures would add to travel times \u201cquite considerably\u201d, at least in the short term. \u201cI think these first few months will be chaotic for UK-based tours and travel companies.\u201d</p> <p>Touring artists would require carnets \u2013 essentially a detailed passport for merchandise \u2013 to avoid paying duty on goods brought into EU nations for business reasons, such as publicity and education materials and equipment used for work. A carnet costs \u00a3325.96 and is valid for one year: it requires the holder to list every item they take into a country.</p> <p>Dugher noted the potential \u201chugely negative impact\u201d on artists\u2019 ability to sell merchandise and transport equipment, resulting in a loss of income of up to 40%, \u201cjeopardising future tours, damaging Britain\u2019s export earnings and threatening our talent pipeline\u201d.</p> <p>Tom Dowse, a guitarist in the emerging UK punk band Dry Cleaning, said: \u201cBeing from a working-class background, touring Europe often represents the only exposure to different cultures and audiences you can experience as a musician. Clearly this is a move to make another sector of the arts the exclusive preserve of those who have access to significant financial support. As usual, that conforms to type. The Conservatives have always wanted to make the opportunity to contribute to the culture of this country something only rich people do.\u201d</p> <p>Paul Reed, the chief executive of the Association of Independent Festivals, said the DCMS guidance, while useful, \u201cdoes not translate into readiness\u201d. He said he did not feel the live music industry was ready for a no-deal Brexit, citing issues including VAT, data protection and the movement of people and equipment. \u201cDespite repeated calls for an EU-wide \u2018touring passport\u2019 in the event of no deal, all we have are short-term assurances regarding freedom of movement up to December 2020 \u2013 and then \u2018leave to remain\u2019 for a further 36 months.\u201d</p> <p>Reed said that while economic uncertainty related to Brexit did not appear to affect independent UK festivals this year, it had influenced UK-based festival promoters operating in other parts of Europe, citing \u201csignificant amounts\u201d spent on contingency planning around the original planned 29 March departure date.</p> <p>\u201cIt is also alarming that UK artists travelling to Europe will have to pre-pay import duty and VAT on all merchandise they bring on tour with them in the event of a no-deal,\u201d Reed said. \u201cFor the government, there seems to be an overemphasis on large-scale events for no-deal planning, but this will all have an impact at grassroots level.\u201d</p> <p>Davyd said the proposed administrative and financial demands were \u201cplainly outside the capabilities and economics of the average musician playing an under-500-capacity show on the continent. If this is the final position then a significant decrease in the number of UK artists able to tour at the grassroots level in the EU27 countries would be the inevitable result.\u201d </p> <p>Rob Challice, an agent at the music touring agency Paradigm, said he doubted the British touring industry was \u201canywhere near\u201d ready for a no-deal Brexit. \u201cThe relevant information is generally unclear because it is dependent on information from other countries that is subject to change on 1 November.\u201d</p> <p>Challice expressed further concern about the need for ATA carnets to transport equipment. \u201cIt\u2019s a complicated piece of paperwork and it does cost money to process. Furthermore, there\u2019s no guarantee that the UK/EU \u2018border\u2019 will be set up to stamp them accordingly.\u201d</p> <p>In April, Sammy Andrews of the industry group Music4EU told the Guardian that a visa requirement would lead to \u201cheavy losses\u201d for work for British road crew and technical engineers. \u201cHaving to get extra visas for them means for certain that many bands will use local crews and not employ people from the UK for those roles, and this could have a devastating impact on that community. We know this for sure because it happens already for exactly those reasons outside of the EU.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 4 October to more accurately reflect the nature of Uefa president Aleksander \u010ceferin\u2019s remarks</p>",

Every roundtrip passing through EU nations requires a completed waybill from the Confederation of Passenger Transport that details the entirety of a planned trip from start to finish. CPT\u2019s operations officer, Mark Purchase, said this would limit the ability of DIY organisations \u2013 for example, a band, small theatre company or charity hiring a minibus \u2013 to tour the EU, as international operator licences were available only to licensed bus and coach operators, not individuals. Purchase said anyone attempting to tour EU states without an international operator\u2019s licence may face fines. He recalled a spate of instances this year in which British operators attempted to tour Belgium with incomplete waybills, incurring fines of \u20ac900 (\u00a3799). Ian McCoid, the general manager of leading Hull-based tour bus company MM Band Services, said these measures would add to travel times \u201cquite considerably\u201d, at least in the short term. \u201cI think these first few months will be chaotic for UK-based tours and travel companies.\u201d Touring artists would require carnets \u2013 essentially a detailed passport for merchandise \u2013 to avoid paying duty on goods brought into EU nations for business reasons, such as publicity and education materials and equipment used for work. A carnet costs \u00a3325.96 and is valid for one year: it requires the holder to list every item they take into a country. Dugher noted the potential \u201chugely negative impact\u201d on artists\u2019 ability to sell merchandise and transport equipment, resulting in a loss of income of up to 40%, \u201cjeopardising future tours, damaging Britain\u2019s export earnings and threatening our talent pipeline\u201d. Tom Dowse, a guitarist in the emerging UK punk band Dry Cleaning, said: \u201cBeing from a working-class background, touring Europe often represents the only exposure to different cultures and audiences you can experience as a musician. Clearly this is a move to make another sector of the arts the exclusive preserve of those who have access to significant financial support. As usual, that conforms to type. The Conservatives have always wanted to make the opportunity to contribute to the culture of this country something only rich people do.\u201d Paul Reed, the chief executive of the Association of Independent Festivals, said the DCMS guidance, while useful, \u201cdoes not translate into readiness\u201d. He said he did not feel the live music industry was ready for a no-deal Brexit, citing issues including VAT, data protection and the movement of people and equipment. \u201cDespite repeated calls for an EU-wide \u2018touring passport\u2019 in the event of no deal, all we have are short-term assurances regarding freedom of movement up to December 2020 \u2013 and then \u2018leave to remain\u2019 for a further 36 months.\u201d Reed said that while economic uncertainty related to Brexit did not appear to affect independent UK festivals this year, it had influenced UK-based festival promoters operating in other parts of Europe, citing \u201csignificant amounts\u201d spent on contingency planning around the original planned 29 March departure date. \u201cIt is also alarming that UK artists travelling to Europe will have to pre-pay import duty and VAT on all merchandise they bring on tour with them in the event of a no-deal,\u201d Reed said. \u201cFor the government, there seems to be an overemphasis on large-scale events for no-deal planning, but this will all have an impact at grassroots level.\u201d Davyd said the proposed administrative and financial demands were \u201cplainly outside the capabilities and economics of the average musician playing an under-500-capacity show on the continent. If this is the final position then a significant decrease in the number of UK artists able to tour at the grassroots level in the EU27 countries would be the inevitable result.\u201d Rob Challice, an agent at the music touring agency Paradigm, said he doubted the British touring industry was \u201canywhere near\u201d ready for a no-deal Brexit. \u201cThe relevant information is generally unclear because it is dependent on information from other countries that is subject to change on 1 November.\u201d Challice expressed further concern about the need for ATA carnets to transport equipment. \u201cIt\u2019s a complicated piece of paperwork and it does cost money to process. Furthermore, there\u2019s no guarantee that the UK/EU \u2018border\u2019 will be set up to stamp them accordingly.\u201d In April, Sammy Andrews of the industry group Music4EU told the Guardian that a visa requirement would lead to \u201cheavy losses\u201d for work for British road crew and technical engineers. \u201cHaving to get extra visas for them means for certain that many bands will use local crews and not employ people from the UK for those roles, and this could have a devastating impact on that community. We know this for sure because it happens already for exactly those reasons outside of the EU.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 4 October to more accurately reflect the nature of Uefa president Aleksander \u010ceferin\u2019s remarks",

Once the domain of cheap drops and drinking games, there are now specialty \u201cbag-in-box\u201d wines selling out in bottle shops across the country, produced by a coterie of Australia\u2019s trendiest winemakers. Technology has advanced, yes, but it\u2019s popular for the same reasons it was a smash hit in the first place: boxed wine is cheap, portable and convenient. You can buy three litres, take it home, and it\u2019ll keep in the fridge for four weeks once it\u2019s opened. The only difference is now, according to Dr Mardi Longbottom, a senior researcher and viticulturist at the Australian Wine Research Institute, the \u201cquality of wine can be exceptional\u201d.</p> <p>Last year, top Sydney restaurant Icebergs kicked things off when it collaborated with Giorgio de Maria Fun Wines to launch its biodynamic house red in a two-litre box. It was poured in-house for $9 a glass, while the cask itself sold at sister venue the Dolphin Hotel\u2019s bottle shop for $55.

      "bodyText": "More than 50 years after it was first invented by a bloke named Thomas Angove in South Australia, boxed wine is back in fashion. It\u2019s come a long way. Once the domain of cheap drops and drinking games, there are now specialty \u201cbag-in-box\u201d wines selling out in bottle shops across the country, produced by a coterie of Australia\u2019s trendiest winemakers. Technology has advanced, yes, but it\u2019s popular for the same reasons it was a smash hit in the first place: boxed wine is cheap, portable and convenient. You can buy three litres, take it home, and it\u2019ll keep in the fridge for four weeks once it\u2019s opened. The only difference is now, according to Dr Mardi Longbottom, a senior researcher and viticulturist at the Australian Wine Research Institute, the \u201cquality of wine can be exceptional\u201d. Last year, top Sydney restaurant Icebergs kicked things off when it collaborated with Giorgio de Maria Fun Wines to launch its biodynamic house red in a two-litre box. It was poured in-house for $9 a glass, while the cask itself sold at sister venue the Dolphin Hotel\u2019s bottle shop for $55. When it sold out, quickly, the team followed up with a 10-litre box of skin-contact orange. There are now several plans for white and rose varieties.

It is a place with more things to do and people to see than ever before. In February, it hosted its first cricket Test match. All in all, it is a town ready to shed its reputation for, in Daley\u2019s words, \u201ctetchy defensiveness bordering on paranoia\u201d. In the same way, the Raiders\u2019 victory on Friday night was no ragged fluke; it took more than guts to hold together amidst relentless goal line assaults. No, this was built on a quiet confidence and professionalism, as befits a city finally growing into itself. It is also the exact kind of organised self-possession that wins grand finals. For Raiders fans new and old \u2013 for the Territory itself \u2013 all that matters is that it lasts 80 more minutes on Sunday night.",

      "body": "<p>The cosmic web, a vast, mysterious structure that links up far-flung galaxies, has been observed directly for the first time.</p> <p>The observations reveal that an ancient cluster of galaxies about 12bn light years away in the constellation of Aquarius are linked together by a network of faint gas filaments. The existence of the cosmic web is central to current theories of how galaxies first formed following the big bang, but until now evidence for it had remained largely circumstantial.</p> <p>The direct detection of the web came following intensive observations designed to pick up the faintest known structures. Prof Michele Fumagalli, an astrophysicist at Durham University and co-author of the work, said: \u201cIt is very exciting to clearly see for the first time multiple and extended filaments in the early universe. We finally have a way to map these structures directly and to understand in detail their role in regulating the formation of supermassive black holes and galaxies.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e5213dbcfaef348318278c4aca708df12617c0fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e5213dbcfaef348318278c4aca708df12617c0fe/0_0_1402_2115/663.jpg\" alt=\"The cosmic web: a map showing the gas filaments and optical light coming from the galaxies.\" width=\"663\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The cosmic web: a map showing the gas filaments and optical light coming from the galaxies.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hideki Umehata/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Galaxy clusters are the most tightly gravitationally-bound structures in the universe and can contain hundreds or thousands of galaxies. However, despite the colossal amounts of gas and dark matter they contain, theoretical predictions suggest that most of the gas in the universe resides in the spaces in between clusters. These calculations predict that 60% of the hydrogen created during the big bang is distributed as long filaments strung out across space in the cosmic web.</p> <p>The latest observations used the European Southern Observatory\u2019s Very Large Telescope to map out the light emitted by hydrogen irradiated by the galaxies within a distant galactic cluster called SSA22.

      "bodyText": "The cosmic web, a vast, mysterious structure that links up far-flung galaxies, has been observed directly for the first time. The observations reveal that an ancient cluster of galaxies about 12bn light years away in the constellation of Aquarius are linked together by a network of faint gas filaments. The existence of the cosmic web is central to current theories of how galaxies first formed following the big bang, but until now evidence for it had remained largely circumstantial. The direct detection of the web came following intensive observations designed to pick up the faintest known structures. Prof Michele Fumagalli, an astrophysicist at Durham University and co-author of the work, said: \u201cIt is very exciting to clearly see for the first time multiple and extended filaments in the early universe. We finally have a way to map these structures directly and to understand in detail their role in regulating the formation of supermassive black holes and galaxies.\u201d Galaxy clusters are the most tightly gravitationally-bound structures in the universe and can contain hundreds or thousands of galaxies. However, despite the colossal amounts of gas and dark matter they contain, theoretical predictions suggest that most of the gas in the universe resides in the spaces in between clusters. These calculations predict that 60% of the hydrogen created during the big bang is distributed as long filaments strung out across space in the cosmic web. The latest observations used the European Southern Observatory\u2019s Very Large Telescope to map out the light emitted by hydrogen irradiated by the galaxies within a distant galactic cluster called SSA22. The team were able to detect individual filaments of intergalactic gas spanning young galaxies in a newly forming cluster. \u201cThese observations of the faintest, largest structures in the universe are a key to understanding how our universe evolved through time, how galaxies grow and mature, and how the changing environments around galaxies created what we see around us,\u201d said Erika Hamden, an astrophysicist at the University of Arizona. The observations of the cosmic web bolster the so-called cold dark matter theory of galaxy formation. This suggests that hydrogen gas created in the big bang collapses first into sheets and then into filaments strung out across space. In places where filaments cross or are clustered together, galaxies form and the filaments continue to fuel the growth of galaxies by feeding them a steady stream of gas. In line with this theory, the latest observations reveal that the intersection between enormous filaments was home to active galactic centres, containing supermassive black holes and \u201cstarbursting\u201d galaxies that have very active star formation. \u201cThis suggests very strongly that gas falling along the filaments under the force of gravity triggers the formation of starbursting galaxies and supermassive black holes, giving the universe the structure that we see today,\u201d said Hideki Umehata, of the Riken Cluster for Pioneering Research and the University of Tokyo, and first author of the research. Previous observations had shown short blobs of gas extending beyond galaxies, but the latest are the first to show extended filaments. \u201cNow we have been able to clearly show that these filaments are extremely long, going even beyond the edge of the field that we viewed,\u201d said Umehata. \u201cThis adds credence to the idea that these filaments are actually powering the intense activity that we see within the galaxies inside the filaments.\u201d The findings are published in the journal Science.",

      "bodyText": "Recommendations to tackle harassment and discrimination at the criminal bar, including mandatory training for judges and barristers and improved flexible working policies at chambers, have been outlined in a report. The proposals published on Thursday from the Association of Women Barristers (AWB) follow a roundtable event to discuss the problem of retaining women and other underrepresented groups at senior level at the bar. They include long-term support for victims of harassment and the recruitment of male \u201cchampions\u201d to help counter a \u201cgentlemanly\u201d culture where it is considered inappropriate or bad form to call out unacceptable behaviour by a fellow barrister. At the roundtable meeting, where female barristers at all levels shared their experiences, participants described working at the bar as a \u201cdog eat dog world\u201d in which those who are white, middle-class and male are most likely to flourish. They raised concerns ranging from being overlooked for work after taking time off for childcare, to discrimination and intimidation. Others cited a lack of facilities in court centres for underrepresented groups \u2013 for example a room where breastfeeding mothers could express milk or toilets for those who identify as non-binary. The report found inappropriate behaviour in robing rooms \u201cstill abounds\u201d, with female barristers finding themselves excluded from conversations about cases and male barristers commenting on the appearances of their female colleagues or discussing which female barristers they \u201cwanted to shag\u201d. Lynne Townley, the AWB chair who co-authored the report with Judge Kaly Kaul QC, said: \u201cData shows the rates of women practising at the bar drops dramatically after five and 10 years\u2019 call as women leave to take on childcare or caring responsibilities. \u201cSo the bullying and harassment we know to be rife will only compound the problem of retaining women in senior positions. Black and minority ethnic women and members of the LGBT community are particularly vulnerable and affirmative steps must be taken so the bar at all levels represents the diversity of our country.\u201d Feedback from female barristers noted that \u201cold-fashioned views\u201d still prevail at the bar, with one senior barrister describing a prevailing culture of \u201cgentlemanliness, of taking a joke, of not naming people, of not reporting\u201d. She told the meeting: \u201cMy impression is if you are funny and charming that is a huge quality at the bar and you can say what you like. Only the other day I was out with people and a solicitor was touching my bum and everyone just looked away. I\u2019m very direct but it\u2019s still considered that women are meant to be charming and funny.\u201d Another lawyer, who said she had always worn a trouser suit into chambers and never touched alcohol at work parties to avoid unnecessary encounters with \u201cknown bullies\u201d, described being propositioned by a married judge 30 years her senior. She said after years of discrimination by male colleagues she sought advice from the Bar Council but was advised if she put in a formal complaint it would damage her career. \u201cThis is not the attitude we should take but I was, to an extent, grateful for advice that helped me escape the toxicity of chambers,\u201d she said. Participants were keen to stress it was not always male colleagues but sometimes other women too who were responsible for holding them back or failing to support them with advancing their careers. The AWB report, In the Age of \u2018Us Too\u2019: Moving Towards a Zero-Tolerance Attitude to Harassment and Bullying at the Bar, found that harassment and bullying was of particular concern during pupillage, where more senior barristers were able to abuse their power amid a fear that reporting an incident would be career-ending. Women were also more likely to be overlooked when it came to being offered leading briefs and the AWB highlighted that barristers\u2019 clerks had a crucial role to play when it came to ensuring a fair playing field within chambers. It recommends chambers should develop flexible clerking regimes to allow for part-time and term-time working. Other recommendations include awareness training for barristers, judges and clerks, and improved facilities for women and non-binary people at court centres.",

It is designed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/19/smacking-children-to-be-banned-in-scotland\">give children equal protection</a> from violence by removing the defence of \u201cjustifiable assault\u201d in Scots law.</p> <p>Parents in England and Northern Ireland are currently allowed to use \u201creasonable chastisement\u201d, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/mar/25/smacking-children-to-be-banned-in-wales\">similar legislation to Scotland</a> was introduced by the Welsh government in March.</p> <p>Leading the final stage debate, Finnie, a former police officer, said there was an urgent need to bring Scotland into line with best practice across the world, with 57 other countries already prohibiting the physical punishment of children.</p> <p>Referring colleagues to the substantial body of research highlighting the damaging long-term effects of physical punishment on children, as well as its ineffectiveness as a parenting strategy, Finnie added: \u201cCritics of this simple reform often say that it criminalises parents, but there is no evidence that this change to the law leads to increased prosecutions in any of the more than 50 countries where this change has taken place.\u201d</p> <p>MSPs also rejected two amendments which the Scottish Conservatives claimed would clarify the bill, in particular around instances such as preventing a child running into a busy road or pulling a pan of boiling water on to themselves.</p> <p>The Scottish government\u2019s children\u2019s minister, Maree Todd, insisted that the removal of the defence would not affect the ability of parents to use restraint to prevent a child coming to harm, saying there was a difference between an act of restraint and act of discipline but underlining that the purpose of the reform was to give equal protection \u201cwith zero qualifications\u201d.</p> <p>But Oliver Mundell, the Scottish Conservative higher education spokesperson, who spoke for the amendments, said the bill failed to set out clear thresholds for state intervention in family life, arguing: \u201cThese concerns about criminalisation have been dismissed throughout the passage of this bill but the truth is no one here can guarantee how this bill will be implemented and interpreted by the police, prosecutors or our courts.\u201d</p> <p>Children\u2019s campaigners welcomed the move as evidence of a wholesale shift in attitudes to child rearing and children\u2019s rights over the past few decades. Mary Glasgow, the chief executive of Children 1st, Scotland\u2019s national children\u2019s charity, condemned what she described as \u201cscaremongering\u201d during the debating of the bill: \u201cListening to the evidence from police, social workers and others working directly with families, it has been clear that there is no intent to criminalise parents, but to bring the law in line with the international evidence and modern parenting practice.\u201d</p> <p>Others warned against complacency. Bruce Adamson, the children and young people\u2019s commissioner for Scotland, said: \u201cThe world is watching, and people hope this will inspire other parts of the UK, but we cannot be complacent as there\u2019s much more we can do to put rights-respecting laws in place, like incorporation of the UN convention on the rights of the child [UNCRC] into Scots law.\u201d</p> <p>In May, the Scottish parliament voted to raise the age of criminal responsibility to 12, but the reform was criticised by some for not raising the age to 14, in line with recommendations from the UN\u2019s committee on the rights of the child.</p> <p>Likewise, campaigners welcomed Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s commitment to incorporate the UNCRC into Scots law within the next two years, which the first minister made in her keynote speech to the SNP conference in April. However, they have since raised concerns that the legislation is not moving fast enough to be completed before the next Holyrood elections in the the spring of 2021.</p>",

It is designed to give children equal protection from violence by removing the defence of \u201cjustifiable assault\u201d in Scots law. Parents in England and Northern Ireland are currently allowed to use \u201creasonable chastisement\u201d, while similar legislation to Scotland was introduced by the Welsh government in March. Leading the final stage debate, Finnie, a former police officer, said there was an urgent need to bring Scotland into line with best practice across the world, with 57 other countries already prohibiting the physical punishment of children. Referring colleagues to the substantial body of research highlighting the damaging long-term effects of physical punishment on children, as well as its ineffectiveness as a parenting strategy, Finnie added: \u201cCritics of this simple reform often say that it criminalises parents, but there is no evidence that this change to the law leads to increased prosecutions in any of the more than 50 countries where this change has taken place.\u201d MSPs also rejected two amendments which the Scottish Conservatives claimed would clarify the bill, in particular around instances such as preventing a child running into a busy road or pulling a pan of boiling water on to themselves. The Scottish government\u2019s children\u2019s minister, Maree Todd, insisted that the removal of the defence would not affect the ability of parents to use restraint to prevent a child coming to harm, saying there was a difference between an act of restraint and act of discipline but underlining that the purpose of the reform was to give equal protection \u201cwith zero qualifications\u201d. But Oliver Mundell, the Scottish Conservative higher education spokesperson, who spoke for the amendments, said the bill failed to set out clear thresholds for state intervention in family life, arguing: \u201cThese concerns about criminalisation have been dismissed throughout the passage of this bill but the truth is no one here can guarantee how this bill will be implemented and interpreted by the police, prosecutors or our courts.\u201d Children\u2019s campaigners welcomed the move as evidence of a wholesale shift in attitudes to child rearing and children\u2019s rights over the past few decades. Mary Glasgow, the chief executive of Children 1st, Scotland\u2019s national children\u2019s charity, condemned what she described as \u201cscaremongering\u201d during the debating of the bill: \u201cListening to the evidence from police, social workers and others working directly with families, it has been clear that there is no intent to criminalise parents, but to bring the law in line with the international evidence and modern parenting practice.\u201d Others warned against complacency. Bruce Adamson, the children and young people\u2019s commissioner for Scotland, said: \u201cThe world is watching, and people hope this will inspire other parts of the UK, but we cannot be complacent as there\u2019s much more we can do to put rights-respecting laws in place, like incorporation of the UN convention on the rights of the child [UNCRC] into Scots law.\u201d In May, the Scottish parliament voted to raise the age of criminal responsibility to 12, but the reform was criticised by some for not raising the age to 14, in line with recommendations from the UN\u2019s committee on the rights of the child. Likewise, campaigners welcomed Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s commitment to incorporate the UNCRC into Scots law within the next two years, which the first minister made in her keynote speech to the SNP conference in April. However, they have since raised concerns that the legislation is not moving fast enough to be completed before the next Holyrood elections in the the spring of 2021.",

We need to work together with parents and communities to build trust and improve access to vaccines before introducing policies that risk penalising children for their parents\u2019 choices. We strongly support practical measures that aim to remove barriers to accessing childhood vaccinations, eg improving appointment booking and provision of reminders, and measures that tackle the spread of misinformation. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, rightly identifies the role of social media companies as a key influencer of parental decision-making, and we would welcome action in this area. It is hard to see how a move to compulsory programmes would be ethically justified unless other, less intrusive, measures had been taken (and had been shown not to have worked).

      "bodyText": "Ursula von der Leyen, the incoming president of the European commission, likes to remind audiences she was \u201cborn in Brussels as a European\u201d. Now it has emerged she plans to live in Brussels in the self-proclaimed heart of Europe \u2013 by sleeping at the office. Von der Leyen will keep her main residence in Hanover but during the working week will live next to her study on the 13th floor of the commission\u2019s Berlaymont headquarters. The former German minister will have a 25 sq m (269 sq ft) living space that already has a sleeping area and running water. Speaking after the German newspaper Die Welt reported the story, a commission spokesperson said: \u201cWe can confirm that the president-elect would like to use an existing personal retreat next to the president\u2019s office to stay overnight during her days in Brussels.\u201d Sources said some slight adaptations may be needed but declined to elaborate. As Germany\u2019s defence minister, Von der Leyen also lived at her ministry in Berlin, an arrangement that is more common in German politics. But the \u201coffice-residence\u201d is less typical in Brussels, where commissioners and travelling MEPs often rent apartments or rooms in the city\u2019s many aparthotels. Jean-Claude Juncker, who stands down at the end of this month, likes to stress that the commission president does not have an official residence. In a recent interview with the German newspaper Bild am Sonntag, he revealed that he lived in a 50 sq m aparthotel in the working week, suggesting it was not ideal for a president. \u201cI couldn\u2019t invite anyone home. I can\u2019t talk to official visitors sitting on my bed,\u201d he said. Sources described the president-elect\u2019s living space as modest and said it would cut costs on room rental and security, as the Berlaymont is tightly guarded around the clock. The arrangement will also keep von der Leyen out of the Brussels traffic jams that snarl up main roads during rush hour. She may run the risk of unwelcome visitors, however: the occasional mouse has been seen scurrying though commission corridors, albeit not on the 13th floor, which has commanding views of the city. The EU\u2019s 28 European commissioners and their senior advisers work at the star-shaped Berlaymont headquarters, as does the chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier. The building, which owes its name to the Dames du Berlaymont convent that once stood on the land, has been the venue for Brexit negotiations since talks began in June 2017. Von der Leyen, who is due to take office on 1 November, is the daughter of one of Europe\u2019s first civil servants. Born in Brussels, she attended the European School in Uccle, although she did not overlap with another notable graduate, Alexander Boris De Pfeffel Johnson. She studied economics, then medicine, building a home and a medical career near Hanover.",

It has sent out this quote from<strong> Peter Kellner, </strong>the former YouGov president and a People\u2019s Vote supporter, explaining the figures.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is clear that the public mood is hardening in favour of a People\u2019s Vote to decide whether Brexit should go ahead.</p> \n   <p>For the past year, most poll questions relating to Brexit have produced modest leads for giving the final say to voters in a referendum. Now, following the supreme court judgement, and as the prime minister prepared to put his revised proposals to Brussels, there are big leads for the public rather than MPs settling the issue.</p> \n   <p>If Boris Johnson does secure a deal, voters divide 47-29% in favour of a People\u2019s Vote. If Johnson returns empty-handed, the margin widens to more than two-to-one, with 52% wanting a referendum and just 23% saying MPs should take the final decision.</p> \n   <p>Not surprisingly, remain voters are keen on a referendum; but so are large number of leave voters. They are evenly divided on what to do if there is a deal (38% parliament, 33%). But by a clear 41-27% margin, leave voters want a referendum, rather than MPs, to settle the matter if there is no deal.</p> \n   <p>As far as the general public is concerned, democracy is no longer served by simply enacting the result of the 2016 referendum. Today there is a far stronger sentiment that the best way forward is to ask the people again, once it is clear what specific form of Brexit is on offer \u2013 deal or no deal.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d9618708f084ab841732130\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-03T15:59:43.886Z\">4.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Sadiq Khan says Boris Johnson's plan designed to fail so he can blame EU</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Sadiq Khan,</strong> the Labour mayor of London, has said that he does not believe Boris Johnson is sincere about wanting a Brexit deal.

The majority of the people in the north don\u2019t and the majority of the people in the Republic of Ireland don\u2019t. </p> \n   <p>But if we are going to be in two different customs unions I think that\u2019s going to create a real difficulty that\u2019s going to be very hard to reconcile.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said he welcomed Johnson\u2019s comments that there would be no new customs infrastructure installed, but he said that pledge appeared to contradict the text of the UK plan, which indicated checks could be carried out at unspecified designated locations</strong>. He said there was a need to \u201ctease out\u201d the detail of Johnson\u2019s plans.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We need to explore in much more detail the customs proposals that are being put forward as it\u2019s very much the view of the Irish government and the people of Ireland, north and south, that there shouldn\u2019t be customs check points or tariffs between north and south.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said that, although in the event of a no-deal Brexit Ireland would have to take steps to protect the single market (ie via some kind of border controls), that was very different to voluntarily agreeing to such a system.</strong> He explained:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If we went up on a no-deal scenario, it may be the case that we have to live no deal for a period of time, and Ireland will do what is necessary to protect the single market, to ensure our place in the single market ... But having to do that for a period of time while we negotiate a deal, or while we pursue other solutions, is very different to an Irish government actually signing up in an international treaty to putting in place checks between north and south, and that\u2019s something that we can\u2019t countenance.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said he would put any new withdrawal agreement to a vote in the D\u00e1il (Irish parliament). </strong>The parliament voted on the original withdrawal agreement, he said. He said he had not considered this issue before, but he said it would be \u201centirely appropriate\u201d to have another vote if there were a new agreement. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If the European parliament is going to vote on it, if the House of Commons is going to vote on it, I think it would be right and proper that the D\u00e1il should too.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said he was not happy about the proposal in the UK plan for Stormont to decide if Northern Ireland would stay in the single market for goods. </strong>One problem was that the power-sharing executive has been suspended, he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>What I would say is we need to be practical about any arrangements when it comes to consent or democracy clauses. Stormont has not sat for three years \u2013 that is the reality of it, so if we wrote into an international treaty provisions that required certain actions by Stormont, what would happen if Stormont wasn\u2019t operating? You would need a fall-back position there as well.

(See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/oct/03/brexit-latest-news-boris-johnson-to-address-mps-as-gove-clams-new-plan-could-get-pretty-solid-majority-in-commons-live-news?page=with:block-5d95f3628f084ab841731f31#block-5d95f3628f084ab841731f31\">2.18pm.)</a></p> \n  <p>And here are the key paragraphs.</p> \n  <p>Concern was expressed about three aspects of the proposals.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>First, the UK proposals on customs and on regulatory aspects explicitly provide for infrastructure, controls and checks but are unclear as to exactly where and how these would be carried out. Any form of controls and checks in and around the border would signify the end of frictionless trade and as such would harm the all-island economy as well as represent a serious risk to the peace process, and could imply a serious risk for consumers and businesses. The proposals tabled by the UK government thus breach a range of fundamental principles and red lines passed in the resolutions of this house. At the same time, such controls would not be sufficient to guarantee the protection of EU consumers and businesses in all circumstances, thereby potentially leaving the EU with a significant hole in its single market.</p> \n   <p>Second, the UK proposals would operationally only be worked out in detail by the EU and the UK, or in the UK unilaterally, during the 14-month transition period. This does not provide the necessary certainty or fulfil the agreed principles in the withdrawal agreement. This would mean the European parliament would have to give consent to the protocol without knowing its full implications, nor having any guarantee as to its legal operation. This is unacceptable.</p> \n   <p>Third, the right of consent being offered to the Northern Irish assembly effectively makes an agreement contingent, uncertain, provisional and unilateral, instead of the safety net provided for by the backstop. Furthermore, the Northern Irish assembly has not sat for nearly three years and it is questionable whether it would be able to reconvene and take on the responsibility for an international treaty of this nature.</p> \n   <p>In summary, the BSG has grave concerns about the UK proposal, as tabled. Safeguarding peace and stability on the island of Ireland, protection of citizens and EU\u2019s legal order has to be the main focus of any deal. The UK proposals do not match even remotely what was agreed as a sufficient compromise in the backstop.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"31be86f94a699ab93d8aa26bcbe40b483117d98f\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31be86f94a699ab93d8aa26bcbe40b483117d98f/0_303_4784_2870/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An EU flag on a desk in the European parliament.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An EU flag on a desk in the European parliament.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Badias/AP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-03T13:56:04.658Z\">at 2.56pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d95f3628f084ab841731f31\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-03T13:18:22.705Z\">2.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">EU parliament says Boris Johnson's Brexit plan not remotely acceptable</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The European parliament has told <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris-johnson\">Boris Johnson</a> that his proposals for the Irish border do not \u201ceven remotely\u201d amount to an acceptable deal for the EU, in comments echoed by Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister,<strong> Daniel Boffey</strong> reports.

He said the supreme court ruling was \u201ca significant development in our constitutional arrangements\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, has said that the EU is \u201cunconvinced\u201d by Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan but still open to discussing it. (See 3.23pm.) And Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, has used a tweet to suggest the plan in unworkable. Sarah Wollaston, the Lib Dem who chairs the Commons liaison committee, has criticised Johnson for twice delaying giving evidence to her committee. She expected him to appear in September, but that hearing was cancelled after parliament prorogued, and she then asked him to appear again before the Queen\u2019s speech. But Johnson is only offering to appear on Thursday 24 October, a week before the UK is due to leave the EU. Wollaston said this would be too late for the committee to subject his plan to proper scrutiny. The European parliament has told Boris Johnson that his proposals for the Irish border do not \u201ceven remotely\u201d amount to an acceptable deal for the EU, in comments echoed by Ireland\u2019s prime minister. Leo Varadkar, the Irish premier, has said the UK Brexit plans \u201cfall short in a number of aspects\u201d. He explained why at a press conference. (See 4.04pm.) Johnson has not explicitly ruled out accepting any further changes to his plan, although during a Commons statement he sounded reluctant to make significant modifications. He said he had already shown \u201cgreat flexibility\u201d and he said that if the EU was unwilling to be equally accommodating, there would be no deal. (See 12pm.) He also claimed that his plans would not require the building of any new customs infrastructure in Northern Ireland. (See 12.15pm.) Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, has insisted that an investigation he ordered into allegations about Johnson (his predecessor) and the US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri will be independent and was not politically motivated. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. My colleagues at the Guardian archives have been looking at what was on the front page of the paper 50 years ago today. And, you\u2019ve guessed it, it was the UK\u2019s relationship with Europe. Only in those days the story was all about Brenter. Here is a clean copy of the Guardian splash on 3 October 1963. It starts: Serious negotiations between Britain and the Common Market seemed measurably nearer last night after a sequence of events in Bonn, Brussels, and Brighton. And you can read the original here. The People\u2019s Vote campaign has released some polling that it says shows growing support for the idea that the final decision on Brexit should be taken by the public in a referendum, and not by MPs in parliament. It has sent out this quote from Peter Kellner, the former YouGov president and a People\u2019s Vote supporter, explaining the figures. It is clear that the public mood is hardening in favour of a People\u2019s Vote to decide whether Brexit should go ahead. For the past year, most poll questions relating to Brexit have produced modest leads for giving the final say to voters in a referendum. Now, following the supreme court judgement, and as the prime minister prepared to put his revised proposals to Brussels, there are big leads for the public rather than MPs settling the issue. If Boris Johnson does secure a deal, voters divide 47-29% in favour of a People\u2019s Vote. If Johnson returns empty-handed, the margin widens to more than two-to-one, with 52% wanting a referendum and just 23% saying MPs should take the final decision. Not surprisingly, remain voters are keen on a referendum; but so are large number of leave voters. They are evenly divided on what to do if there is a deal (38% parliament, 33%). But by a clear 41-27% margin, leave voters want a referendum, rather than MPs, to settle the matter if there is no deal. As far as the general public is concerned, democracy is no longer served by simply enacting the result of the 2016 referendum. Today there is a far stronger sentiment that the best way forward is to ask the people again, once it is clear what specific form of Brexit is on offer \u2013 deal or no deal. Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, has said that he does not believe Boris Johnson is sincere about wanting a Brexit deal. This is what Khan told LBC this morning. I don\u2019t think that Boris Johnson is serious about doing a deal with the European Union. I think what you saw yesterday was a fancy proposal deliberately designed for the EU to reject and then he could blame the EU, like he\u2019s blamed parliament and like he\u2019s blamed judges in the supreme court. The DUP has accused the Irish government of being \u201cobstructionist and intransigent\u201d. This is from the DUP leader Arlene Foster, commenting on what Simon Coveney, Ireland\u2019s deputy premier and foreign minister, said earlier about the Brexit deal being unacceptable in its current form. (See 12.23pm and 12.27pm.) Simon Coveney\u2019s remarks are deeply unhelpful, obstructionist and intransigent. The Irish government\u2019s majoritarian desire to ride roughshod over unionism was one of the reasons why the Withdrawal agreement was rejected. Mr Coveney\u2019s rejection of a reasonable offer is paving the road for a no deal exit because unionism will not allow Northern Ireland to be trapped at the whim of Dublin or the EU. We will not buy that. The Irish government\u2019s preparedness to dump the consent principle for their country\u2019s expediency is foolish in the extreme and sends a very clear message to unionists. Here are the main points from Leo Varakdar\u2019s press conference in Stockholm earlier. Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach, said Boris Johnson\u2019s plans for an alternative to the backstop \u201cfall short in a number of aspects\u201d. In particularly, he said he was concerned about Northern Ireland being in a different customs zone, and he was unhappy about the way the DUP would have a veto over whether the arrangements continued. He said that having Ireland and Northern Ireland in different customs zones would create \u201creal difficulty\u201d. He explained: Our objective is very clear \u2013 we don\u2019t want to see any customs posts between north and south nor do we want to see any tariffs or restrictions on trade between north and south. They were all abolished in the 1990s and we don\u2019t want to go back to that. The majority of the people in the north don\u2019t and the majority of the people in the Republic of Ireland don\u2019t. But if we are going to be in two different customs unions I think that\u2019s going to create a real difficulty that\u2019s going to be very hard to reconcile. He said he welcomed Johnson\u2019s comments that there would be no new customs infrastructure installed, but he said that pledge appeared to contradict the text of the UK plan, which indicated checks could be carried out at unspecified designated locations. He said there was a need to \u201ctease out\u201d the detail of Johnson\u2019s plans. We need to explore in much more detail the customs proposals that are being put forward as it\u2019s very much the view of the Irish government and the people of Ireland, north and south, that there shouldn\u2019t be customs check points or tariffs between north and south. He said that, although in the event of a no-deal Brexit Ireland would have to take steps to protect the single market (ie via some kind of border controls), that was very different to voluntarily agreeing to such a system. He explained: If we went up on a no-deal scenario, it may be the case that we have to live no deal for a period of time, and Ireland will do what is necessary to protect the single market, to ensure our place in the single market ... But having to do that for a period of time while we negotiate a deal, or while we pursue other solutions, is very different to an Irish government actually signing up in an international treaty to putting in place checks between north and south, and that\u2019s something that we can\u2019t countenance. He said he would put any new withdrawal agreement to a vote in the D\u00e1il (Irish parliament). The parliament voted on the original withdrawal agreement, he said. He said he had not considered this issue before, but he said it would be \u201centirely appropriate\u201d to have another vote if there were a new agreement. He said: If the European parliament is going to vote on it, if the House of Commons is going to vote on it, I think it would be right and proper that the D\u00e1il should too. He said he was not happy about the proposal in the UK plan for Stormont to decide if Northern Ireland would stay in the single market for goods. One problem was that the power-sharing executive has been suspended, he said: What I would say is we need to be practical about any arrangements when it comes to consent or democracy clauses. Stormont has not sat for three years \u2013 that is the reality of it, so if we wrote into an international treaty provisions that required certain actions by Stormont, what would happen if Stormont wasn\u2019t operating? You would need a fall-back position there as well. So I think that\u2019s the kind of thing that we need to explore with our British friends. He also said he was unhappy about the DUP having a veto. Our view is that any consent mechanism, where it to exist, would have to be reflective of the view of the whole of population of Northern Ireland and not give any one party or any domination a veto. He said the British political system was denying the public the chance to vote for what polls say they want \u2013 staying in the EU. He made this point as he said that there were five means by which a hard border could be avoided in Ireland: a united Ireland, but there was probably no majority for that at the moment, he said; Ireland rejoining the UK, but that would never happen; the UK staying in the EU; the UK staying in the single market and customs union; and the backstop. He said four of those options would be acceptable to Ireland. On the prospect of the UK staying in the EU, he said: All the polls since Prime Minister Johnson became prime minister suggest that\u2019s what the British people actually want, but their political system isn\u2019t able to give them that choice. This is from Donald Tusk, the president of the European council. Ireland is not coming under pressure from the rest of the EU to agree a Brexit deal for the sake of Europe as a whole, the Irish Europe minister Helen McEntee has said. Speaking on a visit to Dublin Port, she said: Our EU partners have stood beside us for the last three and a half years, and that has not changed. We are not coming under pressure to change those key objectives: protecting the Good Friday agreement, to prevent border infrastructure on the island of Ireland, protecting the economy and the single market, and Ireland\u2019s place in it. McEntee was responding to some of the reporting by pro-Brexit papers in Britain, illustrated by today\u2019s Daily Telegraph splash. Northern Ireland\u2019s chief constable, Simon Byrne, has said that his officers will not staff any form of border security after Brexit. At a meeting of the Northern Ireland Policing Board earlier, Byrne said he had \u201cmade it clear\u201d to the Northern Ireland Office that police would not \u201cstaff any form of border security\u201d after the UK leaves the EU. He said: We have been working closely with the Northern Ireland Office (NIO) to understand our constitutional position in relation to any proposed changes to border arrangements, and I have been clear with the NIO in particular it will not be the role of the PSNI to staff any form of border security. We are clearly there to facilitate normality and day-to-day policing, but not to carry out custom checks and the function of other agencies in whatever proposal is or isn\u2019t agreed in the next few weeks and indeed I have taken legal advice on that basis to confirm to me the independence of the office of chief constable and the duties I have to make sure that police officers are used for legitimate policing purpose. As PA Media reports, Byrne also said had told Boris Johnson that it would not be possible to police the 300 crossing points of the Irish border with his current number of police officers. He said he made the point to Johnson during a 30-minute video call on Friday. It was a very open conversation trying to tell him we saw that it was nigh-on impossible to try and police over 300 crossings with the amount of police officers we had. Here is the full text of the statement issued by the European parliament\u2019s Brexit steering group (BSG) saying Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan is unacceptable. (See 2.18pm.) And here are the key paragraphs. Concern was expressed about three aspects of the proposals. First, the UK proposals on customs and on regulatory aspects explicitly provide for infrastructure, controls and checks but are unclear as to exactly where and how these would be carried out. Any form of controls and checks in and around the border would signify the end of frictionless trade and as such would harm the all-island economy as well as represent a serious risk to the peace process, and could imply a serious risk for consumers and businesses. The proposals tabled by the UK government thus breach a range of fundamental principles and red lines passed in the resolutions of this house. At the same time, such controls would not be sufficient to guarantee the protection of EU consumers and businesses in all circumstances, thereby potentially leaving the EU with a significant hole in its single market. Second, the UK proposals would operationally only be worked out in detail by the EU and the UK, or in the UK unilaterally, during the 14-month transition period. This does not provide the necessary certainty or fulfil the agreed principles in the withdrawal agreement. This would mean the European parliament would have to give consent to the protocol without knowing its full implications, nor having any guarantee as to its legal operation. This is unacceptable. Third, the right of consent being offered to the Northern Irish assembly effectively makes an agreement contingent, uncertain, provisional and unilateral, instead of the safety net provided for by the backstop. Furthermore, the Northern Irish assembly has not sat for nearly three years and it is questionable whether it would be able to reconvene and take on the responsibility for an international treaty of this nature. In summary, the BSG has grave concerns about the UK proposal, as tabled. Safeguarding peace and stability on the island of Ireland, protection of citizens and EU\u2019s legal order has to be the main focus of any deal. The UK proposals do not match even remotely what was agreed as a sufficient compromise in the backstop. The European parliament has told Boris Johnson that his proposals for the Irish border do not \u201ceven remotely\u201d amount to an acceptable deal for the EU, in comments echoed by Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister, Daniel Boffey reports. He goes on: The committee of MEPs representing the parliament\u2019s views on Brexit said the prime minister\u2019s proposals could not form the basis for an agreement, describing them as a \u201clast-minute\u201d effort. The European parliament will have a veto on any withdrawal agreement. \u201cSafeguarding peace and stability on the island of Ireland, protection of citizens and EU\u2019s legal order has to be the main focus of any deal,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cThe UK proposals do not match even remotely what was agreed as a sufficient compromise in the backstop.\u201d Here is his story in full. The Varadkar/L\u00f6fven press conference is over. I will post the highlights soon. Varadkar says there are two positive elements of Johnson\u2019s plan. He welcomes the idea of Northern Ireland being in the single market for goods. And he welcomes the plan for a new deal for Northern Ireland (a cash investment). Q: What is the most probable outcome \u2013 a deal, no deal, or further delay? Varadkar says he would prefer not to predict. Over the last few years he has learned the politics of Brexit can change, and quite quickly. Varadkar suggest the Irish parliament could be given a vote on the Boris Johnson plan. Q: What are the main problems with Boris Johnson\u2019s plan? Varadkar says there are two main problems. If Northern Ireland and Ireland are in different customs zones, he does not see how you can avoid tariffs, checks and customs posts. And, second, he objects to the way the plan would allow the DUP to veto something against the wishes of the rest of the people in Ireland and Northern Ireland. Q: What will you do in the event of no deal? Varadkar says Ireland would take steps to protect the single market. But he says that is very different from Ireland signing up willingly to an international agreement that would require these measures. Q: If the UK leaves the EU, Ireland will be like Sweden - an EU border country. Has Prime Minister L\u00f6fven given you any tips? And what are you doing to prepare for a no-deal Brexit. Varadkar says he and L\u00f6fven discussed the Norway/Sweden border, but it is not a model that he wants to follow because it is a hard border. He says the Irish government will present a budget for no deal next week. This year the Irish economy is growing by 5%. Next year it is forecast to grow by just 0.7%. He says he does not know what will happen on the land border. He wants to protect the single market. But he has not decided with the European commission how that might be done. Leo Varakdar, the Irish taoiseach (PM), is holding a press conference now in Stockholm with the Swedish PM, Stefan L\u00f6fven. He says he has concerns about the UK Brexit plan. He says he is not happy about a consent mechanism that would effectively give the DUP a veto over whether Northern Ireland could stay in the EU single market for goods. And he says the customs plans are not satisfactory. Q: Yesterday\u2019s paper talked about the need for new customs checks. But today Boris Johnson said he would not be building new infrastructure. Varadkar says he is \u201creassured\u201d by what Johnson said about there being no need for new physical infrastructure connected with customs. He says he does not want to see any customs posts between north and south, and he does not want to see any tariffs either. This is what Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament\u2019s lead Brexit spokesman, told Channel 4 News about the UK Brexit plan. The question is not if you want to compromise - we have made a compromise, that was the withdrawal agreement. The question is: is this a serious compromise? And we have serious doubts about that, certainly after the leak of a paper, a document, by Downing Street to the Tory MPs to blame the European Union directly. If there is a Tory document saying that they have to blame the European Union, then it\u2019s obvious that that is the purpose. The backstop is in fact a safeguard that is a type of insurance that you never hope to use. That\u2019s a backstop. And this is quite the opposite, what is proposed. It\u2019s temporary, so it\u2019s not for a long period. It\u2019s depending on the consent of an assembly in Northern Ireland that, for three years, has not been seated, was never in place. And there are serious doubts that it will be in place in the coming years. When Verhofstadt referred to the No 10 plans to blame the EU, Verhofstadt was talking about this BuzzFeed story by Alex Wickham quoting from a \u201clines to take\u201d email sent to Tory MPs. Wickham says: In a sign of the tough rhetoric that Johnson\u2019s government can be expected to use if talks with Brussels break down, MPs were told that if the EU refuses to negotiate on this point, then Conservatives should say that it is Brussels that ended talks, that a deal is \u201cimpossible\u201d, and that the EU\u2019s policy is \u201ccrazy\u201d. Verhofstadt was asked if he thought that at the moment a Brexit deal was possible. He replied: On this element it\u2019s very difficult \u2013 and nearly impossible. Because it\u2019s mainly repackaging the bad ideas that have already been floated in the past. The Johnson statement is over. John Bercow, the Speaker, praises MPs on all sides for the tone adopted during the statement. He says it was a \u201chuge improvement\u201d on what happened last week. I will post a summary of the main points from what Johnson said shortly. Labour\u2019s Matthew Pennycook says, even if the government reaches an agreement with the EU, it would be impossible to finalise the details and agree a trade deal with the EU by the end of next year. Isn\u2019t an extension to the transition inevitable? Johnson says he would be happy to meet Pennycook to explain why he thinks it can be done by the end of 2020. These are from the Times\u2019s Steven Swinford. Neil O\u2019Brien, a Conservative, tells Johnson that the former Lib Dem MEP Andrew Duff, a European federalist, has backed his plan. Johnson says he remembers Duff well and is glad Duff supports his plan. Nicola Sturgeon has accused the Scottish Tories\u2019 interim leader, Jackson Carlaw, of \u201csquandering any credibility he ever had\u201d at this lunchtime\u2019s first minister\u2019s questions. Earlier in the week, Carlaw angered some in the Scottish party by reversing Ruth Davidson\u2019s policy of opposition to a no-deal Brexit. Today Sturgeon said he had gone from \u201centhusiastic remainer to Boris Johnson-loving no-deal Brexiteer\u201d. \u201cNo wonder his colleagues are trying to get rid of him,\u201d added Sturgeon, referring to reports this morning that senior Scottish Tories want an immediate leadership contest rather than keeping Carlaw in post until the next Holyrood elections in 2021. Scottish Tory MSPs are all too aware what a difficult sell Johnson\u2019s Brexit strategy, however it plays out, could be on the doorsteps in 18 months\u2019 time, especially without the galvanising personality of Ruth Davidson to the fore. Some believe there\u2019s still time to set out a long-advertised new policy platform that differentiates the Scottish party from Westminster. But few are talking up the prospects of a Scottish Conservative in Bute House. More pressingly, the 13 Scottish Tory MPs who helped Theresa May stay in Downing Street in 2017 are looking precarious, with the significant impact that will have in a UK election result. The SNP\u2019s Deidre Brock asks: now that Johnson has conceded that different parts of the UK can have a different relationship with the EU, when will he table plans for Scotland to have a different relationship? Johnson says the Good Friday agreement makes Northern Ireland a special case. Labour\u2019s Paul Sweeney quotes what Simon Coveney, the Irish deputy PM, has said this morning about Johnson\u2019s plan. (See 12.23pm and 12.27pm.) Johnson says he listened carefully to Coveney\u2019s words. He says they must get the mechanism of consent right. He says he is happy to discuss this with Coveney, and with Sweeney himself. The SNP\u2019s Brendan O\u2019Hara asks what Johnson would say to Scottish farmers who will be able to see their Northern Ireland counterparts having unfettered access to the single market. Johnson says it is surprising the SNP is making that point when it wants to give the EU control of Scottish fish stocks. Johnson says there may be a need for \u201cde minimis customs checks\u201d under his plan. He suggests that the \u201cfrictionless systems\u201d envisaged in this plan could be of use in future trade deals, including with the EU. Steve Baker, the chair of the European Research Group, which represents Tories pushing for a harder Brexit, and one of the 28 \u201cSpartans\u201d who voted against Theresa May\u2019s deal on every occasion, tells Johnson: \u201cWe now glimpse the possibility of a tolerable deal.\u201d Johnson says he welcomes that coming from Baker, although he says the two have spoken regularly in recent days, and so, he implies, he is not surprised to have Baker\u2019s support. Here is the video of Simon Coveney, the Irish deputy PM, telling the D\u00e1il (Irish parliament) that there will be no agreement unless the UK makes further changes to the alternative backstop plan. John Bercow, the Speaker, has got an extremely croaky voice today and at times it has sounded as if he was whispering. But he finally found a way of laughing it off. Referring to Boris Johnson\u2019s conference speech yesterday, Bercow said this was not down to eating a kangaroo\u2019s testicle. Back in the chamber, Labour\u2019s Stephen Doughty tells Johnson that he thinks this plan is not in accordance with section 10 of the Withdrawal Act. Johnson says he disagrees. The plan does conform with section 10, he claims. Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament\u2019s lead Brexit spokesman, has said that it would be \u201calmost impossible\u201d for MEPs to agree the Boris Johnson plan as it stands, Channel 4 News reports. The EU will not be able to agree to a withdrawal agreement unless the European parliament votes in favour. UPDATE: See 1.43pm for the quotes. Here are more lines from the Commons exchanges. The most significant were probably Boris Johnson\u2019s responses to Philip Davies and Alistair Burt - implying that this is not the PM\u2019s \u201cfinal offer\u201d and that further changes could be made. RTE\u2019s Mary Regan has more on what Simon Coveney has been saying. This is from the BBC\u2019s political correspondent in Northern Ireland, Jayne McCormack. Simon Coveney is the Irish foreign minister and t\u00e1naiste (deputy PM). UPDATE: Here is the key quote. Coveney said: If that is the final proposal there will be no deal, there are a number of fundamental problems with that proposal ... There are elements of this proposal that simply will not be part of any deal. Damian Green, the former work and pensions secretary, asked Johnson to give an assurance that his plans would not require the construction of any new customs infrastructure, at the border or anywhere else. Johnson said that there would be no new infrastructure at or near the border - or in any other place. He told Green: I can tell him that, absolutely not. The proposals we are putting forward do not involve physical infrastructure at or near the border - or indeed at any other place. Johnson says his plans would not require building of any new customs infrastructure in Northern Ireland. The document (pdf) published yesterday said there would be customs checks at \u201cdesignated locations\u201d. Physical checks \u2013 which would continue to be required only on a very small proportion of movements based on risk assessment \u2013 could then take place at traders\u2019 premises or other designated locations which could be located anywhere in Ireland or Northern Ireland. That implied that new customs centres might have to be built, but Johnson seems to be ruling that out. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, tells Johnson his plans are unworkable, unacceptable and undeliverable. He says that if the Northern Ireland assembly can have a veto on the Brexit plans, Scotland should get one too. Scotland did not vote for Brexit, he says. And he says that, if Johnson cannot promise to obey the Benn act, he should resign. Repeating what he said to Corbyn, Johnson says he was disappointed by Blackford\u2019s replay. (This must be the \u201cglutinous emollience\u201d we were promised. See 10.18am.) Here are key extracts from Boris Johnson\u2019s opening statement. Johnson claimed his plan was a \u201ccompromise\u201d showing the government\u2019s willingness to \u201cgo the extra mile\u201d. He said: This government\u2019s objective has always been to leave with a deal. And these constructive and reasonable proposals show our seriousness of purpose. They do not deliver everything that we would have wished. They do represent a compromise. But to remain a prisoner of existing positions is to become a cause of deadlock rather than breakthrough. And so we have made a genuine attempt to bridge the chasm, to reconcile the apparently irreconcilable. And to go the extra mile as time runs short. He said the UK had shown \u201cgreat flexibility\u201d and urged the EU do do the same. If the EU did not, the UK would leave anyway on 31 October, he claimed. He said: I do not for one moment resile from the fact that we have shown great flexibility in the interests of reaching an accommodation with our European friends and achieving the resolution for which we all yearn. If our European neighbours choose not to show a corresponding willingness to reach a deal, then we shall have to leave on 31 October without an agreement, and we are ready to do so. Johnson is replying to Corbyn. He says he was disappointed by Corbyn\u2019s tone. On standards, he says he thinks MPs would want to keep UK standards the highest in the world. Being outside the EU will allow the UK to go further, he claims. He cites animal welfare as an example. The UK will be able to ban the export of live animals. Corbyn asks if Johnson will comply with the law saying he must request a Brexit extension. He says Johnson\u2019s plans are not serious or workable. They would damage the economy of Northern Ireland, undermine the Good Friday agreement, and lead to a \u201crace to the bottom\u201d on workers\u2019 rights. He says Johnson knows these plans are not acceptable to the EU. The only people who won\u2019t suffer are the PM\u2019s hedge fund donors who are betting against the pound, and undermining the economy. He says the plans will be rejected in this house, rejected in Brussels and rejected across the country. UPDATE: Here is a clip of Corbyn. Jeremy Corbyn is responding to Johnson. He says this is a rehashed version of plans that have already been rejected. These plans are worse than Theresa May\u2019s. When will the full legal text be published? He asks why Johnson signed up to the backstop when he says it is now unacceptable. He says every union and business organisation wants the UK to stay in the customs union. He says Johnson\u2019s plan would lead to rights being weakened. It would lead to a Trump Brexit. Having said it wanted no border in Northern Ireland, now it is proposing two borders. Corbyn says the reaction from businesses in Northern Ireland has been \u201cvery stark\u201d. Here is a Guardian story about the business reaction to the plan in Northern Ireland. (Corbyn\u2019s assessment is correct.) Johnson says the UK has shown \u201cgreat flexibility in the interests of reaching an accommodation with our European friends\u201d. If the EU does not also show flexibility, the UK will have to leave the EU on 31 October without a deal. That would be a \u201cfailure of statecraft\u201d on all sides, he says. He says, when he thinks of what the EU has achieved before, he thinks a deal can be achieved. He urges MPs to \u201ccome together in the national interest\u201d. He wants to move on to domestic priorities, including infrastructure, education and the NHS. Johnson is now explaining the plans he published yesterday. Boris Johnson is making his statement to MPs now about his plan for an alternative backstop. There is a summary of the plans here. Johnson says his plan is a \u201ccompromise\u201d. He says the government has \u201cgone the extra mile\u201d in the hope of getting a deal. He says he accepts that the UK and the EU are still \u201csome way off a resolution\u201d. But he says he had \u201cconstructive\u201d calls yesterday with Jean-Clause Juncker, the European commission president, Angela Merkel, the German chancellor and Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach (PM). These are from Daniel Ferrie, a spokesman for the European commission. He is quoting Natasha Bertaud, the commission\u2019s deputy chief spokesperson referring to what Jean-Claude Juncker, the commission president, told Boris Johnson when they spoke by phone yesterday. Under Boris Johnson\u2019s plan the details for new customs rules in Northern Ireland would be thrashed out during the transition. (See here, bullet point eight.) The commission is saying that is unacceptable, because a \u201clegally operational solution\u201d would have to be in the withdrawal agreement. UPDATE: Here is some video. In an interview in the Sunday Telegraph (paywall) at the weekend Boris Johnson hinted that he might be interested in moving to a US-style system for judicial appointments, with senior judges having to be approved by parliament. Speaking about the implications of the supreme court prorogation judgment, Johnson said: If judges are to pronounce on political questions in this way, then there is at least an argument that there should be some form of accountability. The lessons of America are relevant. Last week in the Commons Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, said that MPs might need to \u201creflect\u201d in future on the case for having judicial appointments confirmed by parliament, although he also said he was not personally keen on the idea. Today, when the idea was raised again during attorney general\u2019s question, Cox was much more critical of the idea. He told MPs. I agree ... that a US-style appointments system would be a wholly retrograde step. He also said that such a system \u201cwould not be in the interests of this country\u201d and that the government had \u201cno current plans\u201d to introduce such a system. But Cox did repeat the point he made last week about how Brexit might require wider constitutional reform. He said the supreme court ruling was \u201ca significant development in our constitutional arrangements\u201d. He went on: It is important to take stock of the implications of this judgment not in the immediate aftermath of the ruling, but deliberately, carefully, thoughtfully. We should not jump to hasty conclusions. And the UK\u2019s exit from the EU will have profound ramifications for our constitutional arrangements. I\u2019ve said many times before that I think that does require a coherent, careful examination, possibly through some formal channel, of the means by which we are to be governed after we leave the European Union. By \u201cformal channel\u201d, Cox could be referring to a Speaker\u2019s conference, a device often used to consider constitutional matters, or a constitutional convention, which was something Labour proposed in its 2017 manifesto. Cox suggests some form of constitutional convention might be needed after Brexit to review how the UK is governed. In business questions Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, has just confirmed that the Commons will be suspended (prorogued) on Tuesday next week until the Queen\u2019s speech on Monday 14 October. Valerie Vaz, the shadow chief whip, said that prorogation should have been scheduled for Wednesday night so that Boris Johnson could attend PMQs. She said that Johnson will only have attended one out of a possible four PMQs before the Queen\u2019s speech. Johnson missed one PMQs because he was at the Tory conference instead, and another two PMQS have been missed (in September and next week) because parliament has been prorogued when in other circumstances it might have been sitting. Almost 4 million women born in the 1950s are not entitled to restitution for money they lost out on when the pension age was raised from 60 to 66, the high court has decided. My colleague Amelia Hill has the full details here. From the BBC\u2019s John Campbell From the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth This is what Ireland\u2019s two leading upmarket papers are saying about Boris Johnson\u2019s plan for an alternative to the backstop this morning. The Irish Times in its editorial says what Johnson proposed yesterday was \u201cnot the basis for a workable plan\u201d. The latest UK proposals on Brexit reflect either an extraordinary ignorance of Northern Ireland or a willingness to risk the Belfast agreement \u2013 and the progress of the last 20 years \u2013 to further the Johnson government\u2019s political interests. The need to minimise the inevitable problems caused by a customs border on the island of Ireland is presented as a technical issue when, of course, it is so much more. The contortions necessary to keep the Democratic Unionist party on side have created proposals which would be disastrous for the North\u2019s economy and bring with it wider dangers to peace ... While claiming to support the Belfast agreement, the Johnson government is showing a wilful disregard for it and for the commitments the UK made in negotiations with the EU in December 2017. The most credible conclusion is that the prime minister and those around him have anticipated that this offer will be rejected and their primary objective in framing it in such a manner is their own domestic political advantage. And the Irish Independent in its editorial says a Brexit delay is now necessary, because this plan is not satisfactory. Mr Johnson has argued the backstop is \u201ca bridge to nowhere\u201d. Alas, the slight proposals set down yesterday look like a flimsy pontoon that could be washed away in the first tides of trouble. They require stronger foundations to either protect the legacy of the Good Friday agreement, or seal the single market. They are more an outline than a detailed plan ... Commitments cannot be exchanged for vague possibilities. The Brexiteers fear the UK could be trapped indefinitely in limbo, but they have no problem inviting the same plight on the North. Rejection of the latest Brexit plan may lead to the no deal Mr Johnson warned of. But acceptance could have the same negative outcomes. The British prime minister claims his plan is reasonable. But the risks appear weighed too heavily on one side. Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, was giving interviews this morning defending Boris Johnson\u2019s plan for an alternative to the backstop. Barclay said that he had spoken to Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotatior, about the offer and that the EU were treating these as a \u201cserious set of proposals\u201d. Sir Bernard Jenkin, one of the 28 Tory Brexiter \u201cSpartans\u201d who voted against Theresa May\u2019s deal three times, sounded as if he could be persuaded to vote for Boris Johnson\u2019s plan when he was interviewed on the Today programme this morning. He said he had an \u201copen mind\u201d, but that he and his Brexiter colleagues were looking at what was proposed \u201cvery realistically\u201d. He said: I am quite optimistic that, if the EU were to agree these backstop proposals, it sounds like the DUP would support them and that would change the whole chemistry of the way the Conservative party thinks about this ... We may have to accept a compromise and I think compromise is in the air. The question is whether the EU can compromise. On the Today programme this morning the Irish TD (teachta d\u00e1la - member of parliament) Thomas Byrne, from the main opposition party Fianna F\u00e1il, said that he was \u201cvery concerned\u201d about Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan. He said: We\u2019re very concerned about whether the proposal is serious. The objectives that I suppose, nationally, we have as a nation are that no border will exist on the island of Ireland and it\u2019s not clear that this does that ... [The plan] seems to us that it puts in place a border for customs. On the idea that checks may take place away from the border, he said: It doesn\u2019t matter where they take place. The problem is that customs checks need to be built, they need support of communities. I don\u2019t think they would have support of communities. Historically they\u2019ve needed to be protected, and those protecting them then become targets and then this leads into a cycle of chaos. Boris Johnson will make a statement to MPs later this morning about his plans for a replacement to the backstop. His last appearance in the Commons eight days ago was a diplomatic disaster - no PM in modern times has ever antagonised the opposition so much in one appearance at the despatch box - although it is quite possible that come the general election he won\u2019t regret the impression he created. Today\u2019s statement should be a bit calmer, and it should focus on the detail of the proposal he published yesterday. In the UK and across the EU people have now had almost 24 hours to consider the plan. For it to work, Johnson has to persuade the EU to endorse the blueprint (or at least a version of it he could accept) and MPs to vote for it. As of now, the picture is mixed. At Westminster the DUP has provisionally backed Johnson\u2019s scheme, and the hardline Tory Brexiters - the 28 so-called \u201cSpartans\u201d who voted against Theresa May\u2019s deal three times - are sounding amenable. There are claims enough Labour MPs could back it too for it to get through the Commons. This is what Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, told ITV\u2019s Peston last night. I think it\u2019s got a very good chance of getting through\u2026 The DUP are as you mentioned earlier a supporter of it, they didn\u2019t support any of the previous three attempts to get a deal, I know that some Conservative MPs who were unhappy with the withdrawal agreement, that Theresa negotiated, have said that they\u2019re supportive of this deal, so we have the DUP, Conservatives who were previously opposed, and some broad-minded and constructive Labour MPs. That seems to me to be a pretty solid majority. But EU leaders have not backed the plan. They are distinctly unenthusiastic, although they have stopped short of rejecting it outright (which no one expected at this point anyway, because they don\u2019t want to appear unreasonable). Here is the Guardian story summing this up. Peter Foster, the Telegraph\u2019s Europe editor, says this dynamic is all very familiar. He explains why in a Twitter thread starting here. Here is the agenda for the day. 8.30am: Boris Johnson chairs cabinet. 9.30am: Nicky Morgan, the culture secretary, takes questions in the Commons. 10.10am: Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, takes questions in the Commons. 10.30am: Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, makes a statement about next week\u2019s Commons business. Around 11.30am: Johnson makes a statement to MPs about his plan for a replacement to the backstop. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will be focusing mostly on Brexit and Boris Johnson\u2019s statement to MPs. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news.

I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone.

The best makeup tip is to drink water \u2013 not just while you put your makeup on, but generally. It plumps up your skin and makes it glow.</p> <p>Your foundation shade should always resemble your skin tone. Skin comes in different tones \u2013 this applies to all skin colours \u2013 so some people have warm tones, some have cool tones. One thing I often see is orange foundation with pink necks.</p> <p>People always ask me how to apply glitter and sparkles. You can stick crystals on your face with eyelash glue, the same for glitter. The trick is taking your time, using a fine angled brush and being quite precise. Then there\u2019s how to take glitter off \u2013 because if you just wash your face, then you will end up with glitter everywhere for days. Instead, get some Sellotape and press it on to the glitter to remove. That will leave you properly glitter-free.</p> <h2><strong>The Vixen: \u2018</strong>It baffles me that people use tape to draw on their eyeliner wings\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5aff60a422051a8ce97b7fd7aa8140a236b280c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5aff60a422051a8ce97b7fd7aa8140a236b280c6/1036_138_1083_650/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Vixen at RuPaul\u2019s DragCon 2019 in New York\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Vixen at RuPaul\u2019s DragCon 2019 in New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Santiago Felipe/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If you are in a rush, then pick up your black eyeshadow and don\u2019t put it down until you are done. You can use it for eyeliner, eyebrows, your eyeshadow crease \u2013 so just do them all at once, using one angled brush.</p> <p>I tend to do my brows using a gold liquid liner, which really adds a pop. I have even done it as a boy, when I have been going out to a club. It baffles me that people use tape or card to draw on their eyeliner wings \u2013 it\u2019s not that hard to draw a straight line at a 45-degree angle! It looks manufactured and just makes me think that you failed art class.</p> <p>Drag makeup is designed to pop.

I\u2019ve seen a lot of people who have obviously bought an eyeshadow palette that has five colours, and then put all five colours on their eyelids without blending them. The main technique is to go from light to dark, from the brow bone down to your eyelid. Then just blend everything.</p> <p>My go-to lipstick right now is anything nude \u2013 for me that means a muted, matt grey-toned pink colour. Currently I use Sugarpill Cosmetics Liquid Lip Colour in Trifle. It\u2019s easy and it complements any makeup look. If you wear red and it bleeds out, you can look as if you\u2019ve bitten into a red berry, but that doesn\u2019t happen with nudes.</p> <p>I take as much time on my makeup as I do in creating a look or preparing for a performance and I think that is why drag queens tend to look so good.

      "body": "<p>Joaquin Phoenix isn\u2019t necessarily a man with a wonderful reputation when it comes to interviews. Even at his most switched on, he tends to come across as tetchy and distracted. However, that said, his press tour for Joker doesn\u2019t exactly seem to be helping the matter. Early on, he walked out of <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/no-joker-joaquin-phoenix-walked-interview/\">an interview with the Telegraph</a> after not unreasonably being asked if he was worried that the film would inspire copycat crimes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/02/why-so-stupid-how-joker-is-too-juvenile-to-be-provocative\">Why so stupid: how Joker is too juvenile to be provocative</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And then this week, on Jimmy Kimmel Live, he gave a truly baffling interview. It was full of all the same rambling half-answers as usual, but was also shot through with some half-joking aggression. At one point Kimmel teased Phoenix about his old breakdancing, to which he testily replied: \u201cYou\u2019re making fun of it, but it was pretty serious to me\u201d. And then came an \u201cexclusive outtake\u201d from Joker, where Phoenix railed Christian Bale-style at an offscreen crew member. Phoenix claimed to be surprised by the clip, and apologised for his terrible behaviour. It was, all in all, very odd.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZNBy-BdM2A\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tZNBy-BdM2A?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Phoenix\u2019s publicist <a href=\"https://ew.com/movies/2019/10/02/joker-joaquin-phoenix-outtake-jimmy-kimmel/\">has since</a> said that the clip \u2013 and the ambush, and the response \u2013 were all planned in advance, and that this was yet another I\u2019m Still Here-style fakeout on Phoenix\u2019s part. But nevertheless, it goes to show how much more interesting these sorts of interviews can be when the thick smear of Hollywood grease gets rubbed off. To commemorate Phoenix\u2019s awkwardness, here are some other wonderfully derailed press tours from days gone by.</p> <h2>Jeremy Renner, Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxH20xXY7o\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HGxH20xXY7o?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>By 2013, Jeremy Renner had gained a reputation as the Next Big Thing thanks to his turn in The Hurt Locker and his roles in the Mission: Impossible and Avengers films. But then came Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters, a bad film that Renner had to promote knowing how bad it was. Vulture has compiled <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2013/01/renners-unhappy-hansel-gretel-press-tour.html\">an exhaustive list</a> of his most sullen interviews from the tour \u2013 the sarcastic \u201cwooo\u201d after a clip is shown on Fallon is a highlight \u2013 but look at the video above. Look how much he hates being there. Look at the effort it takes him to say anything positive at all. Look at Gemma Arterton\u2019s body language. I know someone who interviewed Renner on this tour. \u201cAngriest man I ever met\u201d was his takeaway recollection.</p> <h2>Matt Damon, Downsizing</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MZw3TsqOxs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6MZw3TsqOxs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>A press tour that took place in the wake of #MeToo, and went so badly that he had to skip his own premiere. What went wrong for Matt Damon? Was it that he defended men who patted women on the bottom, because they weren\u2019t also rapists? Or when he said that more recognition should be given to men \u201cwho don\u2019t do this kind of thing\u201d?

      "bodyText": "Joaquin Phoenix isn\u2019t necessarily a man with a wonderful reputation when it comes to interviews. Even at his most switched on, he tends to come across as tetchy and distracted. However, that said, his press tour for Joker doesn\u2019t exactly seem to be helping the matter. Early on, he walked out of an interview with the Telegraph after not unreasonably being asked if he was worried that the film would inspire copycat crimes. And then this week, on Jimmy Kimmel Live, he gave a truly baffling interview. It was full of all the same rambling half-answers as usual, but was also shot through with some half-joking aggression. At one point Kimmel teased Phoenix about his old breakdancing, to which he testily replied: \u201cYou\u2019re making fun of it, but it was pretty serious to me\u201d. And then came an \u201cexclusive outtake\u201d from Joker, where Phoenix railed Christian Bale-style at an offscreen crew member. Phoenix claimed to be surprised by the clip, and apologised for his terrible behaviour. It was, all in all, very odd. Phoenix\u2019s publicist has since said that the clip \u2013 and the ambush, and the response \u2013 were all planned in advance, and that this was yet another I\u2019m Still Here-style fakeout on Phoenix\u2019s part. But nevertheless, it goes to show how much more interesting these sorts of interviews can be when the thick smear of Hollywood grease gets rubbed off. To commemorate Phoenix\u2019s awkwardness, here are some other wonderfully derailed press tours from days gone by. Jeremy Renner, Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters By 2013, Jeremy Renner had gained a reputation as the Next Big Thing thanks to his turn in The Hurt Locker and his roles in the Mission: Impossible and Avengers films. But then came Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters, a bad film that Renner had to promote knowing how bad it was. Vulture has compiled an exhaustive list of his most sullen interviews from the tour \u2013 the sarcastic \u201cwooo\u201d after a clip is shown on Fallon is a highlight \u2013 but look at the video above. Look how much he hates being there. Look at the effort it takes him to say anything positive at all. Look at Gemma Arterton\u2019s body language. I know someone who interviewed Renner on this tour. \u201cAngriest man I ever met\u201d was his takeaway recollection. Matt Damon, Downsizing A press tour that took place in the wake of #MeToo, and went so badly that he had to skip his own premiere. What went wrong for Matt Damon? Was it that he defended men who patted women on the bottom, because they weren\u2019t also rapists? Or when he said that more recognition should be given to men \u201cwho don\u2019t do this kind of thing\u201d? Either way, it was the worst Matt Damon press tour since the one where he whitesplained diversity to a black woman. Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan, 50 Shades of Grey Admittedly the excruciating interview format did a lot of the work here \u2013 you try maintaining your good humour while chirpy strangers yell at you from an iPad \u2013 but Glamour\u2019s interview with the stars of 50 Shades of Grey was nevertheless an unscalable wall of awkwardness. There\u2019s little eye contact between Johnson and Dornan, and chilly silences, and overblown exhalations of boredom. It looked, to all intents and purposes, like the pair absolutely hated each other; a sensation backed up by monosyllabic TV interviews and photo after photo after photo in a Jezebel post entitled Double Crap: Fifty Shades of Grey Stars Can\u2019t Fucking Stand Each Other. Jesse Eisenberg, Now You See Me Eisenberg\u2019s reputation for playing aloof, better-than-you entitled pricks more convincingly than anyone else may well have its roots here. In the space of two minutes and 43 seconds, Eisenberg repeatedly manages to belittle his interviewer to the point where he eventually tells her \u201cDon\u2019t cry now; cry after the interview\u2019s over\u201d.

Even when Now You See Me 2 was released, the reputation lingered; in one interview he asked whether or not he came across as an \u201cindulgent prick\u201d. Samuel L Jackson, RoboCop Sometimes, just sometimes, an awkward interview isn\u2019t down to the star. It\u2019s down to an interviewer accidentally thinking that he\u2019s interviewing a different black person than the one he\u2019s actually interviewing.

      "bodyText": "After two days of stock market routs, health checks for the global services sector did little to lift the mood of gloom today. The UK services economy shrank unexpectedly in September, according to IHS Markit \u2013 the worst performance for the dominant sector in six months. At the close the FTSE 100 lost 0.63% on Thursday, down 44.9 points to 7,077.64. The mid-cap FTSE lost 0.66%, falling to 19,348.16 points. However, markets in mainland Europe have performed better, with France\u2019s Cac 40 up by 0.4% and Spain\u2019s Ibex up 0.3%. Germany\u2019s markets were closed for a national holiday. US investors initially greeted their own disappointing services reading by dumping stocks, but the major indices turned around at the time of writing as investors eyed renewed stimulus from the US Federal Reserve. US annualised growth will slow to 1.3%, according to ING. While not yet near recession, it would still represent a significant slowdown for the world\u2019s largest economy. James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, said: The US slowdown signals are multiplying. We were well aware of the problems in manufacturing given the trade war, slower global growth and the competitive disadvantage of a strong dollar, but it is clear that there are problems brewing in other sectors. The latest developments should add a sense of urgency to talks seeking a resolution to the US-China trade dispute and will keep the pressure on the Fed to ease monetary policy further. On currency markets sterling showed signs of moderating some of the gains, as the Democratic Unionist party accused the Irish government of being \u201cdeeply unhelpful, obstructionist and intransigent\u201d. At the time of writing one pound bought $1.239, a gain of 0.7% over the day. Thank you for following the business live blog today. Please do join me bright and early tomorrow morning for more business, markets and economics news, including the US non-farm payrolls data. JJ Some more on those sterling gains: it is not just dollar weakness boosting it this afternoon in London; some Brexit optimism is apparently taking hold as well. The pound is up by about 0.8% for the day, hovering around $1.24 against the US dollar. Sterling earlier hit a high of $1.2413 \u2013 the strongest in eight days \u2013 thanks to some hints that Conservative Brexit hardliners could be ready to compromise on a withdrawal deal. \u201cThere does seem to be maybe some reason to be optimistic in terms of the Brexit plan,\u201d said Jane Foley, senior forex strategist at Rabobank, via Reuters. We know this is not a done deal, but it hasn\u2019t yet been written off. But perhaps don\u2019t get too carried away: EU leaders have not exactly welcomed Boris Johnson\u2019s latest proposals with open arms. Johnson\u2019s plans for an alternative to the backstop \u201cfall short in a number of aspects\u201d, said Irish taoiseach Leo Varadkar. You can read more about the Brexit action on the politics live blog here: Stock markets have regained some of their losses after investors digested the weaker-than-expected services data. The FTSE 100 is now only down by 0.45% for the day as we approach the close in London. In the US the Dow, Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 have all turned positive \u2013 a fairly dramatic rebound after the flurry of selling in the aftermath of the data release. Economists are braced for a slowdown in the US economy. Any optimism among investors has been snuffed out, according to Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com. Whilst still showing the sector in expansion, this was a major miss versus expectations. The market is reacting to the signs of a slowdown in the global economy. The fact these ISM numbers are printing weaker shows even the US is not immune. The trade war is biting services too with respondents saying they are mostly concerned about tariffs. You can read the full report from the ISM (the Institute for Supply Management) and see more quotes on tariffs here. The US may belatedly be catching the cold being suffered by the rest of the world economy, according to Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe. He said: Although it\u2019s not a surprise that major G10 economies are seeing a manufacturing shock and it is spreading to the rest of their economies, it is new information that we are now seeing this dynamic emerge in the United States. It\u2019s increasingly difficult for the hawkish members of the Fed to argue that what we\u2019re seeing is a transitory disruption in the survey data. Those weak data have added to the case for interest rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve if markets are to be believed. Interest rate futures, which investors use to hedge against changes in borrowing costs, show a much increased probability of a Fed rate cut at the end of the month. The market implies a 92.5% chance of lower rates, up from 77% yesterday. The Fed\u2019s next meeting is on 29-30 October. The central bank\u2019s economists will not be publishing updated forecasts, but with gathering storm clouds investors clearly think Jerome Powell, the Fed\u2019s chair, will go anyway. Gold prices jumped as well following the PMI data miss, as investors scurried for safe havens. Spot gold prices are up by 0.95% today, with one troy ounce setting you back about $1,512, up from less than $1,497 earlier this morning. The FTSE 100 is now down by 1.6% for the day. Investors in UK Plc (or at least the multinationals who are listed in London) have suffered this week amid the global selloff. You can see the latest blow at the bottom-right corner of the graph. The US dollar dropped in the aftermath of the data \u2013 briefly pushing the British pound above $1.24. This chart tells a pretty clear story about the US economy. With manufacturing potentially in recession and the services sector slowing, it is not necessarily one with a happy ending. The Dow Jones industrial average has now lost 1% for the day. The index of US blue chip stocks has fallen by more than 3% in the last two days \u2013 this would be the third day in a row of a drop of more than 1% if it holds. US stocks have fallen sharply in the wake of the data. The S&amp;P 500 was back down by 0.59% two minutes after the release. The US services sector slowed to its slowest rate of growth in three years, according to the ISM non-manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI). The reading for September fell back to 52.6 points, down from 56.4 in August and well below the 55-point reading expected by economists. The survey had shown a rebound in August after the weakest reading in nearly three years. The IHS data are a precursor to the more closely followed ISM figures, due in less than five minutes. August\u2019s ISM reading came in at 56.4, indicating a continued strong expansion. Consensus expectations are for a fall back to 55 (although still firmly above that 50-point growth mark). You can see from the graph above that US services expansion has slowed markedly in recent months. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said: A disappointing service sector PMI follows news of lacklustre manufacturing and means the past two months have seen one of the weakest back-to-back expansions of business activity since 2009, sending a signal of slower GDP growth in the third quarter. The surveys are consistent with the economy growing at a 1.5% annualised rate in the third quarter, with forward-looking indicators suggesting further momentum could be lost in the fourth quarter. In particular, inflows of new business have almost stalled, with September seeing the smallest increase since 2009, and business expectations about the year ahead remain stuck at one of the gloomiest levels since at least 2012. However, the sector saw the slowest rise in new business since the start of data collection in October 2009, IHS Markit said. Markets appear to be relieved, with the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq now positive in the wake of the data. But while the headline may be relatively strong, the other indications in the survey are far from positive. From IHS Markit: September data indicated only a slight increase in business activity across the U.S. service sector, with the expansion constrained by the slowest monthly rise in new business recorded since data collection began in October 2009. Subsequently, firms reduced their workforce numbers for the first time since early-2010. Business confidence also remained subdued amid ongoing economic uncertainty. The US services sector continued to expand in September, according to IHS Markit\u2019s services PMI. The indicator came in at 50.9 points, above the 50-point mark which indicates an expansion. That was in line with expectations and 0.2 percentage points above the previous month. Coming up shortly we have a pair of health checks for the US services industry. First up, IHS Markit will publish its US services purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) at 2:45pm BST, followed by the ISM non-manufacturing PMI on the hour. Wall Street opened flat, but investors will have their eyes on the PMI data to see if it flashes another warning light about the state of the US economy \u2013 and whether it is at risk of falling into a recession. Jasper Jolly here to take you through the data publication. Wall Street has opened largely flat, following yesterday\u2019s heavy sell-off when the Dow Jones lost almost 500 points. Dow Jones down nearly 40 points, or 0.15%, to 26,039 S&amp;P 500 down 2.2 points, or 0.08%, at 2,885 Nasdaq up 1.7 points, or 0.02%, to 7,787 The pound is having a good day, trading nearly 0.6% higher against the dollar and the euro. Yesterday sterling fell by a similar amount, as Boris Johnson set out his Brexit plan at the Tory party conference in Manchester. It has not been well received in Brussels, where Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, described the prime minister\u2019s new plan for the Irish border as a trap. The pound is up even though the European parliament has told Johnson that his proposals for the Irish border do not \u201ceven remotely\u201d amount to an acceptable deal for the EU \u2013 comments that were echoed by Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney. US jobless claims rose to 219,00 last week from 215,000 the week before, more than expected. The four-week average, however, was unchanged at 212,500, according to figures just released by the US Labor Department. Selling continues in the London stock market, with the FTSE 100 index down 61 points at 7,061, a 0.86% drop. Markets on the continent are enjoying some respite from the selling. France\u2019s CAC is 0.18% ahead while Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB has gained 0.24%. German markets are closed for the day of unity, which commemorates German reunification in 1990. Wall Street futures were pointing to a higher open but have turned negative. Gold has benefited from the global economic gloom and new tariffs, as it is generally considered a safe haven asset in times of turmoil. Spot gold is up 0.2% at $1,502.90 an ounce. Donald Trump is talking of a \u201cnice victory\u201d for the US in its long-running trade dispute with the EU, over subsidies the EU has given to aerospace firm Airbus. The Scottish Labour party is similarly concerned. Labour\u2019s shadow cabinet secretary for finance, jobs and fair work, Rhoda Grant said: People\u2019s jobs and living standards should not be put at risk because of a dispute between politicians. The UK government must do all it can to ensure the United States reverses this decision. The Scottish Conservatives have also expressed concerns. Shadow finance secretary Murdo Fraser said: This is obviously a very serious blow to the Scotch whisky industry. We will be speaking to our colleagues in the UK government to see what can be done to sort this out. Ultimately, the responsibility here lies with the EU as it stands, and they are the ones who will need to explain to the sector why this has happened. This is something that needs to be resolved as a matter of urgency.\u201d The Scottish government has also waded into the trade row, saying news of the tariffs was \u201cdeeply concerning for Scotch whisky and other Scottish products exported to the US\u201d. We still hope that Scottish exports will not become collateral damage in this trade dispute and support the EU\u2019s ongoing work towards a negotiated settlement with the US. We have made our concerns about the impact on whisky and other Scottish produce clear to UK ministers, and expect them to do all they can to protect Scottish exports. The Scottish government also said that the tariffs indicated that the UK would not be able to offset the damage from Brexit by striking a trade deal with the US. When Scotland\u2019s food and drink businesses are facing the potential impact of a \u2018no deal\u2019 Brexit, the last thing they need is the further uncertainty of increased tariffs on exports to US. The imposition of these tariffs also seriously undermines suggestions by the UK government that a potential free trade deal with the United States could easily or quickly offset the damage done by Brexit. The US is the biggest export market for Scotch whisky. The Malt Whisky Trail reckons that while the tariffs are obviously unwelcome they will not stop Americans buying whisky. It represents seven whisky distilleries including single malt brands Glenfiddich and Glenlivet, which are both popular in the US. The group\u2019s chair, James Johnston, said: This ruling is unwelcome but the quality, consistency and character of the Speyside malt defines the uniqueness of a product which will continue to stand up in economically challenging situations. The Scottish food and drink sector has grown three times faster than the rest of the Scottish economy over the past decade and is responsible for over half of all manufacturing jobs along the Malt Whisky Trail. Cashmere is also affected. It is particularly concerning to see that this judgement will also impose a tariff on cashmere given the fact that Johnston\u2019s of Elgin is another major employer in the region and specialises in fine cashmere clothing. However the remarkable growth of the sector is down to its success in opening up new overseas markets, underpinned with unquestionably high-end products. Keeping it all in context, whilst the US may impose new tariffs, sales to new markets such as China and the Middle East are booming. GMB Scotland has condemned Trump\u2019s planned 25% tariffs on Scottish whisky, which threaten to escalate the trade war between the US and EU. Scotch whisky exports to the US were worth $1.3bn (\u00a31bn) last year. Gary Smith, GMB Scotland Secretary, said: This is a troubling glimpse into the post-Brexit future and everyone with the Scottish economy\u2019s best interests at heart should be concerned about our prospects following this development. Scotland and the rest of the UK are sitting ducks after 31 October. The collective strength we have in the EU trading bloc will be gone and there is simply no such thing as a \u2018special relationship\u2019 with the United States - Trump will squeeze the UK economy for everything he can get. That\u2019s why we have consistently called on the UK government to bring forward measures to defend whisky and white spirits manufacturing in the face of Brexit uncertainty and to stand-up to US demands on the removal of the geographical indicator protection for single malt production. Those calls have fallen on deaf ears. In Westminster, Extinction Rebellion protesters have sprayed fake blood on the steps of the Treasury in central London. They used an old fire engine to spray 1,800 litres water coloured with red food dye towards the building. Four protesters stood on top of the vehicle, which bore a banner reading \u201cStop funding climate death\u201d. Over in Germany, the picture is similarly gloomy. Service industries in Europe\u2019s biggest economy grew at the weakest pace for three years last month, due to weaker demand from within the country while new exports dropped the most in over five years. Germany\u2019s business sector as a whole, including manufacturers, shrank for the first time since April 2013. France and Spain are still growing, albeit at a slower pace, while Italy saw a small pickup in private-sector growth. Expansion in the eurozone as a whole shuddered to a halt last month, with the PMI reading the worst since June 2013. Barclays economist Fabrice Montagn\u00e9 says the September PMI survey leaves little scope for optimism, signalling a broad based weakening of economic conditions with Brexit being mentioned by businesses as the main culprit for falling demand. At face value, the survey suggests a 0.1% q/q contraction in Q3 GDP, much lower than our forecast of 0.3% q/q growth. Brexit is now visible in the data: Brexit is referenced throughout the September report with businesses mentioning mitigation measures, restructuring and subdued demand as the main sources of weakness in activity. Overseas clients have reportedly been cutting off British counterparties, diverting activity away from the UK in anticipation of a hard Brexit outcome. Lack of demand for UK services resulted in lower prices charged despite higher input prices and workforce reduction for nearly a fifth of the survey respondents - even though, for now, companies appear to be avoiding outright redundancies by not replacing departing workers. The services PMI suggests that after rising by 0.1% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter, growth in the biggest part of the economy has now all-but fizzled out, says Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics. While we still think that the economy has avoided a recession in Q3, the data reinforce our view that the economy\u2019s performance will remain well below par until Brexit is resolved. Admittedly, we can take some comfort from the fact that the surveys have not been a foolproof guide to the official data recently. They did not pick up the impact of Brexit preparations ahead of the 29th March Brexit deadline and will probably fail to do so again. That could add an extra 0.1ppt to quarterly GDP growth in Q3. And the PMIs exclude the recent resilience in the retail and government sectors. In addition, July\u2019s surprisingly strong rise in GDP of 0.3% m/m suggest that the economy did at least start the quarter on a solid footing. Today\u2019s batch of PMI surveys were pretty bleak, especially for the UK, Germany and the eurozone as a whole. Worryingly, Britain\u2019s dominant services sector, which includes restaurants, hotels and financial firms, is now declining, joining manufacturing and construction. The headline figure fell to a six-month low of 49.5. (The 50 mark separates expansion from contraction) The orders reading was 48.7, pointing to falling orders, while the employment reading (47.8) suggests jobs are being cut at the fastest rate since November 2009. JPMorgan Chase economist Allan Monks says: This signals that the weakness seen to date will broaden out to the consumer and wider economy. While the focus is often on the large growth drag coming from Brexit, it should be remembered that this is happening against a weakening global backdrop. It means that we could get an interest rate cut from the Bank of England in coming months. Monks adds: Last week we revised our growth and BoE forecasts, putting in a January cut. We highlighted the risk of an easing this year. That risk has risen following the September PMI. It is worth knowing that a recession is commonly defined as two or more quarters of economic contraction. By this definition the UK was last in recession at the height of the financial crisis in 2008-09. We have had a spate of gloomy business surveys this morning suggesting the downturn in manufacturing spread to service industries in the UK and the eurozone last month. Separate official figures from the EU\u2019s statistics office Eurostat show that retail sales in the eurozone bounced back to 0.3% monthly growth in August after a 0.5% drop in July, driven by strong sales of electronics, computers and internet shopping. However, the numbers tend to jump around. June recorded stronger growth of 0.8%. Inflation pressures also eased. Prices charged by manufacturers fell more than expected, by 0.5% in August from the previous month, reflecting a sharp decline in energy prices. Some of Ted Baker\u2019s problems are self-inflicted, but its sales decline (down 2.5% in the six months to 10 August) is another sign of how tough things are on the high street. Its new chief executive Lindsay Page, who took over from Ray Kelvin in April, told Reuters: We have faced probably the most difficult trading conditions that I can ever recall in 30 years. Shares in FTSE 250-listed Ted Baker, the fashion chain, have plummeted this morning. They are currently down 35% at 594.13p. The fashion retailer dived to a first-half loss and warned on its full-year performance, its third warning this year. Trading in the first half has been worse than expected, Ted Baker said, and the second half had started slowly because of an unseasonably warm September. There has also been a financial hit from the \u00a32m cost of an investigation and \u201clegal matters\u201d relating to allegations of misconduct by the former chief executive Ray Kelvin who stepped down in March. Time for another look at the markets. London\u2019s FTSE 100 index is sliding for a fourth day. Yesterday it suffered its worst one-day drop since before the June 2016 Brexit vote, and today it is down 0.58%, some 41 points, at 7,080. Selling has been triggered by worries over the UK and world economy, along with Brexit uncertainty and Donald\u2019s Trump\u2019s latest salvo in the trade dispute with the EU. The new 25% US tariffs are due to come in in a fortnight and will affect hundreds of European agricultural products, including British woollen jumpers, olives from France, Germany and Spain, pork, salami, butter and yogurt. However, cognac and champagne are excluded. Here is the full list. The UK economy shrank by 0.2% in the three months to June, so if it contracts again in the third quarter, as the PMI report suggests, it would mean that it is in recession. However, it is worth noting that GDP rose 0.3% in July, the start of the third quarter. How much of this was down to Brexit stockpiling is anyone\u2019s guess... All three sectors \u2013 services, manufacturing and construction \u2013 registered lower output in September. Excluding July 2016, following the EU referendum, this was the first broad-based decline since April 2009. Construction recorded the steepest drop in activity. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey, said: A trio of grim reports on the economy means that the vast service sector has now joined manufacturing and construction in decline. Only the collapse in confidence immediately following the 2016 referendum has seen a steeper overall deterioration in the economy during the past decade, but September\u2019s decline is all the more ominous, being the result of an insidious weakening of demand over the past year rather than a sudden shock. At current levels the surveys point to GDP falling by 0.1% in the third quarter which, coming on the heels of a decline in the second quarter, would mean the UK is facing a heightened risk of recession. He said that Brexit-related concerns were at the forefront of people\u2019s minds, linked by companies to falling sales, cancelled and postponed projects, a lack of investment and job losses. While the early summer had seen resilient jobs growth, the surveys indicate that employment is now falling at the fastest rate since December 2009. The increasingly dire readings push the surveys further into territory that would normally be associated with policy stimulus from the Bank of England, suggesting a greater likelihood that the next move in interest rates will be a cut. This means the all-sector output index, which comprises services, manufacturing and construction, fell to 48.8 from 49.7, indicating a faster rate of contraction. This marked the first back-to-back contraction since the final two months of 2012. The UK service industries unexpectedly shrank last month, the PMI survey shows, and Britain\u2019s economy edged closer to recession. The headline figure fell to a six-month low of 49.5, from 50.6 in August, below the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, says the latest batch of services PMIs for the eurozone confirm a broad slowdown in economic activity. The worry is that these latest readings appear to confirm worst fears that the manufacturing slump is leaching into the services sector with falling confidence, investment and now activity. Manufacturing is at its worst since 2012, but now service sector growth is at a six-year low. Undoubtedly the risk of a no-deal Brexit is weighing on business confidence and investment, hurting output across the board. The German services PMI was a real blow. Business activity grew at the weakest pace in three years, while inflows of new work were at a 5-year low. Germany is set for a technical recession. Whilst German is leading the way south, France and Italy are also contributing to the weakness, while Ireland and Spain are also weak. The FTSE 100 index continues to slide, losing 36 points or 0.5% to 7,086. European stock markets are faring better today after yesterday\u2019s sharp declines. France\u2019s CAC and Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB are both about 0.5% ahead. Markets in Germany are closed for the day of German unity. In France, private-sector growth slowed last month, with the business activity index dropping to 50.8 from 52.9, the weakest growth rate since April. Service-sector expansion slowed and manufacturing production is in decline. With Europe\u2019s powerhouse slowing sharply, the eurozone as a whole (almost) ground to a halt last month. The IHS Markit composite output index fell to 50.1 from 51.9, marking the lowest reading since June 2013. The 50 mark divides expansion from contraction. In Germany, the service industries grew at their slowest rate in three years last month, and inflows of new work fell for the first time since December 2014. The main business activity reading dropped to 51.4 from 54.8 in August. Even worse, the composite PMI fell into negative territory for the first time since April 2013 \u2013 suggesting Germany\u2019s private sector as a whole is now declining. The composite PMI, which includes services and manufacturing, fell to 48.5, from 51.7 in August. Italy\u2019s composite output index also rose slightly to 50.6 from 50.3, signalling the fourth consecutive month of growth in Italy\u2019s private sector. This was driven by a pick-up in services which outweighed a sharper contraction in manufacturing production, which shrank for the 14th month in a row. Italy is next. Its service industries expanded at a faster pace last month, with the PMI headline reading rising to 51.4 from 50.6 in August. Domestic demand improved, while new export sales shrank for a third month. Spain\u2019s composite output index, which comprises the manufacturing and service sectors, fell to 51.7 last month, from 52.6 in August. The latest reading matched July\u2019s 68-month low, as the manufacturing downturn deepened and service growth softened. The first of the PMIs is out. Spain\u2019s service sector continued to expand in September, albeit at a slower rate. The headline business activity index fell to 53.3 from 54.3 in August. A reading above 50 indicates expansion; a reading below points to contraction. We\u2019ve had another high-profile departure from a major company, prompting one observer to say there must be something in the water. Alison Cooper will stand down as chief executive of tobacco giant Imperial Brands, the company behind Davidoff and Lambert &amp; Butler cigarettes, after nine years at the helm. Sadly, this further reduces the limited number of female bosses of FTSE 100 companies. It comes after the departure of the Tesco boss Dave Lewis, Metro Bank\u2019s founding chairman Vernon Hill, and Martin Gilbert, a City veteran and deputy chairman of Standard Life Aberdeen, who had stood down from the post of co-chief executive earlier in the year. All were announced yesterday. Cooper departs as the tobacco industry faces health fears over vaping, while traditional cigarette sales are in long-term decline. Some questioned the timing of her exit. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says The timing of the move is curious, given that the company as well as the sector is facing some serious headwinds as we move into the end of the year and look to 2020. Last week the company saw its share price fall sharply to nine-year lows after the company announced that it was cutting its revenue guidance on the back of concerns that the health problems now being expressed about vaping could result in a sharp slowdown in sales. In August we heard early reports about a series of deaths from the 18-35 age group which may have been linked to vaping. The tobacco industry is now facing the prospect of an existential crisis, with a slowdown on normal cigarette sales already cutting into profits, e-cigarettes were supposed to be the next key growth area. This strategy now appears to be under threat after the US threatened to ban e-cigarettes from the market, until the US Food and Drug administration has done a more significant study. Given these problems looking for a new CEO would appear to be the least of its problems. Interestingly, there was no quote from Cooper in the company\u2019s announcement. Chairman Mark Williamson paid tribute to her, saying: Alison has worked tirelessly and with great energy and passion during her 20 years with Imperial. And we\u2019re off. The FTSE 100 index in London has fallen some 8 points to 7,114 in early trading, a 0.1% drop. France\u2019s CAC has inched 0.1% higher and Spain\u2019s Ibex added 0.2% in early trading, after heavy losses yesterday. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Fears over the world economy have sent shares around the world tumbling as the manufacturing slowdown deepened. Wall Street stocks suffered their steepest declines in almost six weeks after weak factory and employment data. Manufacturers around the globe are cutting back production, faced with falling orders, according to the latest batch of PMI surveys. Hiring in the US has slowed, with ADP, the US\u2019s largest payroll supplier, reporting yesterday that employers had added 135,000 new jobs in September. The monthly average has fallen to 145,000, from 214,000 a year ago. The latest jobs report from the US government is due tomorrow. The US-China trade war has cast its shadow over the global economy and further adding to tensions, Washington opened a new front in its trade dispute with the EU yesterday. The Trump administration won approval to impose new tariffs on $7.5bn of European goods, including Scotch whisky and French wine after a World Trade Organization ruling, in retaliation for subsidies given by the EU to the aerospace group Airbus. The tariffs could take effect as early as 18 October. The S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones slipped below their 100-day moving averages for the first time in a month - which could signal further declines. The S&amp;P 500 lost 1.79% to 2,887.61 while the Dow dropped almost 500 points, or 1.86%, to 26,078.62 and the Nasdaq fell 1.56% to 7,785.25. In London, the FTSE 100 dropped 237 points to 7,122.54 yesterday, a 3.2% decline - its biggest one-day fall since 2016 - while the CAC in Paris fell 3.1% to 5,422. The sell-off has continued in Asian markets overnight. Japan\u2019s Nikkei fell 2%, its biggest one-day decline since late August, while Australian shares lost 2.07% to a five-week low. European markets are set to open slightly lower. Today, the focus is on services surveys for the eurozone, UK and US, which will shed further light on the extent of the economic slowdown.

According to IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (Cips), activity in the sector fell as companies reported sliding sales, job losses, cancelled and postponed projects and weak investment levels. The warning shot for the sector \u2013 which includes restaurants, hotels and finance and accounts for about 80% of the economy \u2013 comes after separate figures indicated that construction and manufacturing output also declined last month. Fears are mounting over the health of the global economy, with figures on Thursday showing the US service sector also slumped last month, dipping to its slowest rate of growth for three years. Activity in the eurozone ground to a halt, and the German private sector shrank for the first time in six years. Stock markets around the world have sold off sharply in recent days as investors grow increasingly concerned over the health of the world economy, against the backdrop of rising trade tensions between the US and China.

      "body": "<p>Has there ever been a more cruelly miscast \u201ccandid friend\u201d to the royal family than Her Majesty\u2019s Press, who are neither truly candid, nor remotely the sort of people one knows socially? And, yes, I obviously include myself in that.</p> <p>In any case, the ONLY acceptable way to look at the royal family is that practised by Princess Michael of Kent, of whom the Queen is once said to have remarked: \u201cShe\u2019s rather grand for us.\u201d (Remember: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2014/apr/16/princess-michael-father-nazi-ss-officer\" title=\"\">children of former Nazis</a> always marry down.) Unfortunately, this simple shtick has not been grasped by so many of our great newspapers. They embody Sybil Fawlty\u2019s lament over Basil\u2019s relationship with the guests: \u201cYou never get it right, do you? You\u2019re either crawling all over them, licking their boots, or spitting poison at them like some Benzedrined puff adder.\u201d</p> <p>And so with the royal press. Either they\u2019re wanking on fawningly for 15 pages about some wedding we probably ought not to have paid for, where every guest without exception hates and pities them. Or they\u2019re making the word BIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIITCH stretch over those same 15 pages, and imagining it counts as fair comment for some minor violation of a quid-pro-quo policy that only they understand, and whose impenetrable rules they change every three minutes anyway.</p> <p>For some decades, my favourite reaction has been the mad leader columns in which the paper in question rants about what they are OWED by whichever prince or princess has denied them #content of some form or other. These are the journalistic equivalent of screaming in the street that a woman should have sex with you because you bought her a drink. Or, in this case, bought a titchy percentage of her drink as a UK taxpayer. In any other arena it would be regarded as certifiably embarrassing behaviour.</p> <p>And with that, we must narrow our frame of reference to the \u201cselect media outlets\u201d \u2013 print and TV \u2013 that have spent the past year or so affectlessly tormenting Prince Harry and his wife Meghan for clicks, yet are now calling for the smelling salts because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/01/meghan-sues-mail-on-sunday-for-publishing-letter-to-her-father\" title=\"\">the couple have decided to launch a legal action</a>.</p> <p>There is, as we know, no snowflake like a freedom-of-speech snowflake. Freedom of speech being the sole human right these particular papers and TV pundits recognise, there is now <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10056775/prince-harry-journalist-malawi-africa-hospital-visit/\" title=\"\">a great outpouring of \u201ccandid friendship\u201d</a> warning the couple that they have gone too far by speaking freely. Freedom of speech is a one-way street, and the last thing people who are a distant sixth in line to the throne, and receding from it fast, should be behaving like is slightly crap celebrities.</p> <p>And yet, and yet \u2026 is it? I hate to point out the obvious, but the series of events that would lead to Harry and Meghan becoming operational and actually taking the throne would be so immense, sensational and horrifyingly multi-corpsed, that \u2013 were it to happen \u2013 editors probably wouldn\u2019t mind any more which mode of transport they had taken back from a trip to New York two years before. So what does any of it matter? A Google summit in Italy, charity editorship of Vogue, a private jet to Elton\u2019s house, something-or-other in the royal box at Wimbledon, refusing to show what one paper called \u201call of Archie\u201d to the photographers \u2013 these wouldn\u2019t be quite the major deal they are laughably imagined at the moment.</p> <p>Having said all that, we papers have got to stick together. So in the spirit of colleaguery, I am very pleased to offer the lawyers of the newspapers in question a series of historical precedents I have unearthed from the global archives \u2013 all of which relate to other royal women who were no better than they should be. I believe they show why your current approach is the right one, and offer them humbly for presentation to the courts in due course.</p> <h2><strong>Newspaper response to complaint by Anne Boleyn</strong><br></h2> <p>We are saddened to learn you claim \u201cdistress\u201d at our meticulous coverage of public-interest questions regarding your fingers. The public are very interested in them. As you know, our article Does Anne Boleyn Have Six Fingers? was one of the very first newspaper questions to which the answer is \u201cno\u201d. We pride ourselves on our pack-leading journalism. Our coverage of this issue amounted to valuable \u2013 estimable \u2013 public service journalism, and no one will ever say that <a href=\"https://www.historyextra.com/period/tudor/did-anne-boleyn-have-six-fingers-on-one-hand/\" title=\"\">you have six fingers</a> again. Certainly not for centuries, still, even when it is definitely untrue. However, you need to understand that this generous service on our behalf is a two-way street, and it is time for you to honour your side of the bargain. Why will you not repeatedly sit for our portraitist, displaying all your fingers, in a manner that would quell residual gossip? What is it you have to hide? Is it a rudimentary finger? People are beginning to ask again, and it is only right that we report their allegations. Furthermore, I am afraid your failure to understand our mutually beneficial relationship means we have had to run a portrait using Photoshoppe, which is captioned: \u201cHow Anne Boleyn might look if she had six fingers.\u201d We are saddened to have been driven to this. Please consider our feelings.</p> <h2><strong>Newspaper response to complaint by Elizabeth I</strong><br></h2> <p>We must caution Your Majesty against your frankly hysterical complaint regarding our hugely popular, long-running front-page series Is Queen Bess a Maid Or No? Like many newspapers, we breathed a sigh of relief when an investigation found your mother, Anne Boleyn, was killed <a href=\"https://www.historyextra.com/period/tudor/anne-boleyn-death-execution-where-buried-how-die/\" title=\"\">not by a relentless campaign of conspiracist shittery</a>, but by an executioner\u2019s blade. A reminder that gossip doesn\u2019t kill people \u2013 swords do. Alas, it is a great and most portentous sadness to us to find you repeating some of her mistakes. While during her life we shat on her every week for everything, to the point where she presumably didn\u2019t know whether she was coming or going, we now speak of her as someone who got it absolutely, tragically right always as far as dealing with us is concerned. She was a saint. She worked with us. You should, too. What\u2019s the worst that could happen?</p> <h2>Newspaper response to complaint by Marie de\u2019 Medici<br></h2> <p>We were disappointed to receive your extraordinary complaint over our coverage of your attendance of the Galileo summit in Italy. This newspaper has made no secret of its concerns over Mr Galileo\u2019s fashionable theories that the Earth goes round the sun, or of our concerns that he is being manipulated in a way we cannot quite put our finger on, but which will allow us to maintain our policy of thinking his insistent warnings probably aren\u2019t really that big of a deal. Without wishing to lapse into technical jargon, we are confident that he will \u201cget his\u201d in due course. Above all, your complaint reeked of hypocrisy from top to bottom: you also like to tell us that the world is round, but you were pictured walking on flat earth on your arrival. Both things cannot be true.</p> <h2>Newspaper response to complaint by Catherine the Great<br></h2> <p>We are extremely concerned by the emotional and eccentric tone of your complaint regarding a thoroughbred stallion with whom you have been linked. It would appear from your highly unconventional and unseemly missive that you think we said you had sex with a horse, and you go on to say \u2013 in emotional terms, not befitting an imperial majesty \u2013 that you didn\u2019t. But if you look closely at what we published, you will see that all we said was that some people on the internet were saying you had sex with a horse. This is a matter of fact. They were saying it.

      "bodyText": "Has there ever been a more cruelly miscast \u201ccandid friend\u201d to the royal family than Her Majesty\u2019s Press, who are neither truly candid, nor remotely the sort of people one knows socially? And, yes, I obviously include myself in that. In any case, the ONLY acceptable way to look at the royal family is that practised by Princess Michael of Kent, of whom the Queen is once said to have remarked: \u201cShe\u2019s rather grand for us.\u201d (Remember: children of former Nazis always marry down.) Unfortunately, this simple shtick has not been grasped by so many of our great newspapers. They embody Sybil Fawlty\u2019s lament over Basil\u2019s relationship with the guests: \u201cYou never get it right, do you? You\u2019re either crawling all over them, licking their boots, or spitting poison at them like some Benzedrined puff adder.\u201d And so with the royal press. Either they\u2019re wanking on fawningly for 15 pages about some wedding we probably ought not to have paid for, where every guest without exception hates and pities them. Or they\u2019re making the word BIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIITCH stretch over those same 15 pages, and imagining it counts as fair comment for some minor violation of a quid-pro-quo policy that only they understand, and whose impenetrable rules they change every three minutes anyway. For some decades, my favourite reaction has been the mad leader columns in which the paper in question rants about what they are OWED by whichever prince or princess has denied them #content of some form or other. These are the journalistic equivalent of screaming in the street that a woman should have sex with you because you bought her a drink. Or, in this case, bought a titchy percentage of her drink as a UK taxpayer. In any other arena it would be regarded as certifiably embarrassing behaviour. And with that, we must narrow our frame of reference to the \u201cselect media outlets\u201d \u2013 print and TV \u2013 that have spent the past year or so affectlessly tormenting Prince Harry and his wife Meghan for clicks, yet are now calling for the smelling salts because the couple have decided to launch a legal action. There is, as we know, no snowflake like a freedom-of-speech snowflake. Freedom of speech being the sole human right these particular papers and TV pundits recognise, there is now a great outpouring of \u201ccandid friendship\u201d warning the couple that they have gone too far by speaking freely. Freedom of speech is a one-way street, and the last thing people who are a distant sixth in line to the throne, and receding from it fast, should be behaving like is slightly crap celebrities. And yet, and yet \u2026 is it? I hate to point out the obvious, but the series of events that would lead to Harry and Meghan becoming operational and actually taking the throne would be so immense, sensational and horrifyingly multi-corpsed, that \u2013 were it to happen \u2013 editors probably wouldn\u2019t mind any more which mode of transport they had taken back from a trip to New York two years before. So what does any of it matter? A Google summit in Italy, charity editorship of Vogue, a private jet to Elton\u2019s house, something-or-other in the royal box at Wimbledon, refusing to show what one paper called \u201call of Archie\u201d to the photographers \u2013 these wouldn\u2019t be quite the major deal they are laughably imagined at the moment. Having said all that, we papers have got to stick together. So in the spirit of colleaguery, I am very pleased to offer the lawyers of the newspapers in question a series of historical precedents I have unearthed from the global archives \u2013 all of which relate to other royal women who were no better than they should be. I believe they show why your current approach is the right one, and offer them humbly for presentation to the courts in due course. Newspaper response to complaint by Anne Boleyn We are saddened to learn you claim \u201cdistress\u201d at our meticulous coverage of public-interest questions regarding your fingers. The public are very interested in them. As you know, our article Does Anne Boleyn Have Six Fingers? was one of the very first newspaper questions to which the answer is \u201cno\u201d. We pride ourselves on our pack-leading journalism. Our coverage of this issue amounted to valuable \u2013 estimable \u2013 public service journalism, and no one will ever say that you have six fingers again. Certainly not for centuries, still, even when it is definitely untrue. However, you need to understand that this generous service on our behalf is a two-way street, and it is time for you to honour your side of the bargain. Why will you not repeatedly sit for our portraitist, displaying all your fingers, in a manner that would quell residual gossip? What is it you have to hide? Is it a rudimentary finger? People are beginning to ask again, and it is only right that we report their allegations. Furthermore, I am afraid your failure to understand our mutually beneficial relationship means we have had to run a portrait using Photoshoppe, which is captioned: \u201cHow Anne Boleyn might look if she had six fingers.\u201d We are saddened to have been driven to this. Please consider our feelings. Newspaper response to complaint by Elizabeth I We must caution Your Majesty against your frankly hysterical complaint regarding our hugely popular, long-running front-page series Is Queen Bess a Maid Or No? Like many newspapers, we breathed a sigh of relief when an investigation found your mother, Anne Boleyn, was killed not by a relentless campaign of conspiracist shittery, but by an executioner\u2019s blade. A reminder that gossip doesn\u2019t kill people \u2013 swords do. Alas, it is a great and most portentous sadness to us to find you repeating some of her mistakes. While during her life we shat on her every week for everything, to the point where she presumably didn\u2019t know whether she was coming or going, we now speak of her as someone who got it absolutely, tragically right always as far as dealing with us is concerned. She was a saint. She worked with us. You should, too. What\u2019s the worst that could happen? Newspaper response to complaint by Marie de\u2019 Medici We were disappointed to receive your extraordinary complaint over our coverage of your attendance of the Galileo summit in Italy. This newspaper has made no secret of its concerns over Mr Galileo\u2019s fashionable theories that the Earth goes round the sun, or of our concerns that he is being manipulated in a way we cannot quite put our finger on, but which will allow us to maintain our policy of thinking his insistent warnings probably aren\u2019t really that big of a deal. Without wishing to lapse into technical jargon, we are confident that he will \u201cget his\u201d in due course. Above all, your complaint reeked of hypocrisy from top to bottom: you also like to tell us that the world is round, but you were pictured walking on flat earth on your arrival. Both things cannot be true. Newspaper response to complaint by Catherine the Great We are extremely concerned by the emotional and eccentric tone of your complaint regarding a thoroughbred stallion with whom you have been linked. It would appear from your highly unconventional and unseemly missive that you think we said you had sex with a horse, and you go on to say \u2013 in emotional terms, not befitting an imperial majesty \u2013 that you didn\u2019t. But if you look closely at what we published, you will see that all we said was that some people on the internet were saying you had sex with a horse. This is a matter of fact. They were saying it. At least two of them, one of whom may or may not be our chief reporter\u2019s secret account. We have the greatest of respect for our readers and present them with such things in order that they may make their own judgments. Ergo, you have insulted our readers. If anything, we are now the ones being traduced by you. We would really question the wisdom of getting angry about things you ought more regally to accept. We think you\u2019ll find it\u2019s counterproductive. VERY counterproductive.",

Figures published by the housing ministry showed construction began on 37,220 homes in England in the three months to June \u2013 8% down on the same period a year ago, and the lowest quarterly number of new home starts since 2016. Annual new housing starts fell to 160,640 in June, 1% lower than a year ago. The government has continued a pledge made under Theresa May to boost housebuilding amid a national shortage, with a target to build 300,000 homes a year. The chancellor, Sajid Javid, and Robert Jenrick, the housing secretary, unveiled plans at the Conservative party conference for a \u201crevolution\u201d in housing and infrastructure, announcing the relaxation of planning laws to boost the property market.

However, analysts warned the decline in new housing starts was a leading indicator for a future downturn in completions. The decline comes as the British economy edges closer towards the first recession since the financial crisis amid uncertainty from Brexit and a slowing global economy. Patrick Gower, a residential research associate at the estate agency Knight Frank, said: \u201cAmid the current political turmoil housebuilders must make judgments about what the sales market will look like years from now. \u201cMost indicators suggest housing completions will continue to climb over the near term, but are very unlikely to meet the government\u2019s annual target of 300,000.\u201d A survey of UK construction on Wednesday showed housebuilders cutting back on new work as a result of the economic and political turmoil. House prices are falling across London and the south of England, while growth in values elsewhere has also stalled. Luke Murphy, the associate director at the IPPR thinktank said cuts to housing grants meant housing associations were more reliant on private sales, with a downturn in the private sector therefore also having an impact on affordable housing construction. \u201cWithout a buoyant market to sell into, housebuilders are pulling back,\u201d he added. The number of new home starts has risen in recent years, from fewer than 120,000 a year in 2014 to the current levels, although they are still significantly short of an annual peak of 352,540 new dwellings in 1968.

      "bodyText": "It feels like there are two different Ireland sides in this World Cup, one with Johnny Sexton, which thumped Scotland, and the one without, which lost against Japan. Against Russia, we saw both. Sexton played the first 40 minutes and Ireland led 21-0 at half-time, then Joe Schmidt wrapped him in tissue paper and popped him back in his box to keep him safe for the next game. Jack Carty came on and Ireland laboured horribly against a side who spent 13 of the next 20 minutes playing with 14 men because they had two players sent to the sin-bin. Right now, Sexton is holding this campaign together. Ireland won 35-0, which sounds better than it looked. Not least because they suffered a number of injuries along the way. Joey Carbery pulled out just before the match because he had aggravated an old ankle injury and Rob Kearney had to go off in the second half because he was \u201ca little tight in the groin\u201d. Schmidt reckons they will both be fit to play their final group match a week on Saturday. He will be more worried about Jordi Murphy, who has just joined the squad as a replacement for Jack Conan, but had to go off after half an hour. Murphy, Schmidt said, \u201cmay have popped a rib\u201d. Sexton was captaining Ireland for the first time, which is a sign of how much they have come to rely on him.

      "body": "<p>Paul Gauguin was the first European artist to find brown skin more beautiful than white. He makes that plain in his <a href=\"https://www.wga.hu/html_m/g/gauguin/07/marque05.html\">1902 painting Barbarian Tales</a>, a highlight of the National Gallery\u2019s ultimately frustrating exhibition. Who is the \u201cbarbarian\u201d of the title? The gnome-like European who squats like Rumpelstiltskin, or the two serene Pacific women he is next to? It\u2019s not quite right, however, to call the male colonial interloper who gloats over the pair\u2019s unabashed bodies \u201cwhite\u201d. His flesh is a horrible bright pink.</p> <p>Gauguin painted this self-excoriating work just a year before his death in the Marquesas Islands in 1903. The grotesque European voyeur is surely a guilty expression of his own appetite for \u201cexotic\u201d female flesh. In 1891, aged 43, he set sail for Tahiti with funding from the French government. He lived in and painted the Pacific world for the rest of his life, apart from a short return to France. More particularly, he portrayed Oceanian women, naked as often as not. </p> <p>When Gauguin painted his bold and intimate portrait <a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/436446\">Two Tahitian Women</a>, now in New York\u2019s Met, was he merely enjoying their bare-breasted voluptuousness \u2013 or was he doing something more subtle? They stand strong in friendship, defying the racist contempt of Gauguin\u2019s age. But this great portrait, like other key Pacific works by the artist, isn\u2019t in the National Gallery\u2019s nervous cop-out of a show.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"29fdd0c024efc00bbd48306bcd829e7a76956b21\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29fdd0c024efc00bbd48306bcd829e7a76956b21/82_67_1751_2580/679.jpg\" alt=\"Like a confession \u2026 Barbarian Tales, 1902.\" width=\"679\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Like a confession \u2026 Barbarian Tales, 1902.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Gauguin/Museum Folkwang Essen/ARTOTHEK</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Barbarian Tales appears to have been let through because its inclusion of a horrid western voyeur undercuts the calm, clear admiration with which Gauguin dotes on women\u2019s breasts. It\u2019s not hard to understand why, in an age of anxiety and anger about representations of race and gender, the National Gallery has turned its eyes away from Gauguin\u2019s most intense works of art. But this self-censorship doesn\u2019t just betray the artist, it\u2019s also a somewhat futile gesture from a gallery whose collection is full of nude white women.</p> <p>Gauguin\u2019s 1892 painting Woman of the Mango reveals his sensual joy in the new world he found in Tahiti, but this woman wears a violet European dress that covers her up to the neck. The National Gallery effectively takes the side of the missionaries who made Tahitians wear such \u201cdecent\u201d clothes. The scaredy-cat evasiveness becomes surreal when you reach Gauguin\u2019s 1893-94 Self-Portrait with Manao Tupapau, in which he poses in front of a painting of a woman lying naked on her front that can itself be seen as a portrait. Yet we\u2019re only allowed to see it indirectly here, in a colourless lithograph. Where is the closely related work Nevermore in which a woman lies in psychological torment like a character from Poe, except nude?</p> <p>So you turn the corner and find \u2026 a room full of flower paintings. Huh? The curators claim these still lifes are \u201csubstitute portaits\u201d. Fine. A bowl of sunflowers probably is a symbol of Gauguin\u2019s tragic friend Van Gogh. But it\u2019s a poor substitute for a full survey of Gauguin\u2019s many actual portraits of Pacific people. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f112fb297b23c182cffde6745c01ccfa8596a8b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f112fb297b23c182cffde6745c01ccfa8596a8b2/39_74_1598_2612/612.jpg\" alt=\"More from the missionary wardrobe \u2026 Gauguin\u2019s Woman of the Mango.\" width=\"612\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">More from the missionary wardrobe \u2026 Gauguin\u2019s Woman of the Mango.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Baltimore Museum of Art</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The timidity of replacing nudes with flowers is painfully obvious \u2013 and troubling. If we can\u2019t see art, we can\u2019t debate it. And there is so much to debate. Whatever you feel about this artist \u2013 who lived at the height of outright European imperialism and racism and, by choosing to live in colonised lands and paint their people, put himself at the anguished heart of that history \u2013 we need to look at him frankly to test those feelings.</p> <p>There is one great Tahitian painting here that encapsulates what I think Gauguin was doing. It\u2019s called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/may/25/art\">Merahi </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/may/25/art\">Metua </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/may/25/art\">No Tehamana</a>, which means Tehamana Has Many Parents. It portrays Teha\u2019amana a Tahura sitting in a striped European dress of the type Christian missionaries imposed on their flocks, with a collar up to the neck. But she\u2019s put flowers in her hair that suggest a richer, more sensual civilisation. Her eyes look off into regions of inward thought. She is remembering. Behind her are monuments to the art and beliefs the missionaries want to destroy. There are mysterious glyphs inspired by inscriptions on Rapa Nui (Easter Island), a carved wooden goddess, and ghostlike ancestral heads. Gauguin is not just referring to his young lover\u2019s literal parents. He is saying she is the heir to the tremendous artistic achievements and long history of the Pacific world.</p> <p>This was painted at a moment when no other European was standing up for non-western art. Gauguin shows his respect for Teha\u2019amana a Tahura\u2019s cultural heritage - but he also shows, in his meticulous depiction of her confining European dress that denies who she is, why he was driven to portray Tahitian women as bold self-confident nudes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a56b38074211b84d5877715df80b34f0baae38a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a56b38074211b84d5877715df80b34f0baae38a/0_0_2717_2140/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Audacious self-portrait \u2026 Christ in the Garden of Olives, 1889.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"788\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Audacious self-portrait \u2026 Christ in the Garden of Olives, 1889.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Gauguin/Norton Museum of Art</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We don\u2019t see many of those. Instead, there\u2019s more than we need of Gauguin\u2019s early career when he painted in Brittany and promoted himself as leader of the avant garde. Portrait of the Painter Slewinski shows a man who\u2019s a flattened tableau of mottled tans, eclipsed by a dazzling bunch of flowers. Is Gauguin a great portraitist, in the conventional sense? No, because he is not that interested in other people.</p> <p>Compared with portraits by his contemporaries C\u00e9zanne and Van Gogh, those of pre-Tahiti Gauguin lack empathy and compassion \u2013 except for himself. In his 1889 painting Christ in the Garden of Olives, he gives the suffering Jesus his own features. He rarely looks at others with such feeling. He became obsessed with the features of his artist friend Meijer de Haan. One of the tremendous sculptures scattered through the show turns De Haan into a wicked sprite emerging magically from a tree trunk. It\u2019s a monstrous, not tender, image that resurfaces, merged with Gauguin himself, as the demonic European in Barbarian Tales.</p> <p>That coldness reaches its nadir in the small selection of works he did in Arles, when he lived with Van Gogh in the Yellow House. They are much less passionate that Van Gogh\u2019s \u2013 even though the Dutchman copied his drawing of Madame Ginoux. He needed to go further south than Van Gogh to find his own soul \u2013 all the way to the south Pacific. But just when it should soar, this exhibition puts on the brakes. Its treatment of Gauguin in Tahiti is a mess. His greatest and most controversial achievements are sidestepped in favour of all those flowers. Tahiti is presented as the last chapter of a long development. In reality, it was Gauguin\u2019s redemption.</p> <p>\u2022 At <a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/exhibitions/the-credit-suisse-exhibition-gauguin-portraits\">National Gallery, London, from 7 October to 26 January</a>.</p>",

The scaredy-cat evasiveness becomes surreal when you reach Gauguin\u2019s 1893-94 Self-Portrait with Manao Tupapau, in which he poses in front of a painting of a woman lying naked on her front that can itself be seen as a portrait. Yet we\u2019re only allowed to see it indirectly here, in a colourless lithograph. Where is the closely related work Nevermore in which a woman lies in psychological torment like a character from Poe, except nude? So you turn the corner and find \u2026 a room full of flower paintings. Huh? The curators claim these still lifes are \u201csubstitute portaits\u201d. Fine. A bowl of sunflowers probably is a symbol of Gauguin\u2019s tragic friend Van Gogh. But it\u2019s a poor substitute for a full survey of Gauguin\u2019s many actual portraits of Pacific people. The timidity of replacing nudes with flowers is painfully obvious \u2013 and troubling. If we can\u2019t see art, we can\u2019t debate it. And there is so much to debate. Whatever you feel about this artist \u2013 who lived at the height of outright European imperialism and racism and, by choosing to live in colonised lands and paint their people, put himself at the anguished heart of that history \u2013 we need to look at him frankly to test those feelings. There is one great Tahitian painting here that encapsulates what I think Gauguin was doing. It\u2019s called Merahi Metua No Tehamana, which means Tehamana Has Many Parents. It portrays Teha\u2019amana a Tahura sitting in a striped European dress of the type Christian missionaries imposed on their flocks, with a collar up to the neck. But she\u2019s put flowers in her hair that suggest a richer, more sensual civilisation. Her eyes look off into regions of inward thought. She is remembering. Behind her are monuments to the art and beliefs the missionaries want to destroy. There are mysterious glyphs inspired by inscriptions on Rapa Nui (Easter Island), a carved wooden goddess, and ghostlike ancestral heads. Gauguin is not just referring to his young lover\u2019s literal parents. He is saying she is the heir to the tremendous artistic achievements and long history of the Pacific world. This was painted at a moment when no other European was standing up for non-western art. Gauguin shows his respect for Teha\u2019amana a Tahura\u2019s cultural heritage - but he also shows, in his meticulous depiction of her confining European dress that denies who she is, why he was driven to portray Tahitian women as bold self-confident nudes. We don\u2019t see many of those. Instead, there\u2019s more than we need of Gauguin\u2019s early career when he painted in Brittany and promoted himself as leader of the avant garde. Portrait of the Painter Slewinski shows a man who\u2019s a flattened tableau of mottled tans, eclipsed by a dazzling bunch of flowers. Is Gauguin a great portraitist, in the conventional sense? No, because he is not that interested in other people. Compared with portraits by his contemporaries C\u00e9zanne and Van Gogh, those of pre-Tahiti Gauguin lack empathy and compassion \u2013 except for himself. In his 1889 painting Christ in the Garden of Olives, he gives the suffering Jesus his own features. He rarely looks at others with such feeling. He became obsessed with the features of his artist friend Meijer de Haan. One of the tremendous sculptures scattered through the show turns De Haan into a wicked sprite emerging magically from a tree trunk. It\u2019s a monstrous, not tender, image that resurfaces, merged with Gauguin himself, as the demonic European in Barbarian Tales. That coldness reaches its nadir in the small selection of works he did in Arles, when he lived with Van Gogh in the Yellow House. They are much less passionate that Van Gogh\u2019s \u2013 even though the Dutchman copied his drawing of Madame Ginoux. He needed to go further south than Van Gogh to find his own soul \u2013 all the way to the south Pacific. But just when it should soar, this exhibition puts on the brakes. Its treatment of Gauguin in Tahiti is a mess. His greatest and most controversial achievements are sidestepped in favour of all those flowers. Tahiti is presented as the last chapter of a long development. In reality, it was Gauguin\u2019s redemption. \u2022 At National Gallery, London, from 7 October to 26 January.",

More than a century later there are no drinks on sale but the wildly colourful bar of the short-lived Cabaret Fledermaus has been recreated for an exhibition exploring the artistic role of cafes, cabarets and clubs around the world. The show at the Barbican art gallery in London shines light on the jazz clubs of Harlem, the Mbari clubs of Ibadan, Nigeria, and incubators of radical thinking such as the Cave of the Golden Calf in London and the Caf\u00e9 de Nadie in Mexico City. More than 300 works are on display, the showstopper being the remarkable recreation of the Fledermaus bar by teachers, students and archivists at the University of Applied Arts in Vienna. \u201cIt is incredible, they worked tirelessly,\u201d said the show\u2019s curator, Florence Ostende. \u201cThey just had a black and white photograph and a colour postcard and they had to zoom in on every single detail to reconstruct the design.\u201d The original bar and its recreation are works of art in their own right.

Ostende said the show was about celebrating the importance of places such as Cabaret Fledermaus that had often ended up being footnotes in art history. Spanning from the 1880s to the 1960s, 12 venues around the world are featured, offering an alternative history of modern art, according to the curators.

Other interior recreations in the show include a room from Theo van Doesburg\u2019s L\u2019Aubette in Strasbourg, a huge entertainment complex labelled the \u201cSistine Chapel of abstract art\u201d, which opened in 1928. Every Thursday evening during the exhibition\u2019s run, the Aubette space will become a music venue co-curated by the jazz trumpet player Mark Kavuma.

      "body": "<p>The Scottish government has extended its ban on fracking after ministers confirmed it would not grant permission for any onshore drilling projects.</p> <p>Paul Wheelhouse, the environment minister, said his devolved government would also refuse to issue licences for onshore unconventional oil and gas projects, including fracking, shale gas or coalbed methane projects.</p> <p>But Wheelhouse rejected calls from climate campaigners and Scottish Labour for fracking to be specifically outlawed by legislation in Scotland. He said the government\u2019s regulatory powers under its planning and licensing systems were strong enough.</p> <p>Promising the government could consider legislation if it was needed in future, Wheelhouse said fracking was incompatible with the Scottish parliament\u2019s new target of cutting climate emissions to net zero by 2045, which was passed by MSPs last week.</p> <p>\u201cThere has been a dramatic change in public perceptions of the environment, the climate crisis and the expectations of government to respond,\u201d he said. As a result \u201can unconventional oil and gas industry would not be of sufficient positive benefit to Scotland to outweigh its negative impacts\u201d.</p> <p>Claudia Beamish, Scottish Labour\u2019s environment spokeswoman, said that without legislation this ban could be overturned by another government in future.</p> <p>The ban formalises a moratorium <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/28/scotland-announces-moratorium-on-fracking-for-shale-gas\">first announced</a> by the Scottish government in January 2015 after it came under intense pressure, fuelled by pro-independence activists and campaigns in Scottish National party target seats affected by fracking licences in central Scotland.</p> <p>It is understood there were strong reservations about a permanent ban from Fergus Ewing, the then energy minister, but in 2017 ministers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/03/scottish-government-bans-fracking-scotland-paul-wheelhouse\">confirmed the moratorium</a> would continue.</p> <p>It led to a court challenge by the oil and chemicals giant Ineos, which runs the Grangemouth chemicals and oil refinery complex west of Edinburgh.</p> <p>The Scottish government won but its lawyers admitted in court that the moratorium did not amount to a formal ban. It was instead a policy of \u201cno support\u201d, a distinction which Wheelhouse repeated on Thursday.</p> <p>Mark Ruskell, the Scottish Greens climate spokesman, said ministers should now follow through by finally rejecting an application by Ineos dating from 2012 to produce coalbed methane near Airth.</p> <p>Wheelhouse said that application would now be decided and said the government\u2019s chief planner had written on Thursday to Scotland\u2019s 32 councils to tell them planning permission for any unconventional oil and gas project should now be refused.</p> <p>That planning direction would be underwritten in the next national planning framework, giving it statutory force. That is due to be passed by the Scottish parliament before the next Holyrood elections in May 2021, he added, but that could not be guaranteed.</p> <p>Mary Church from Friends of the Earth Scotland said: \u201cIt is frustrating that today\u2019s decision falls short of the full legal ban that would put the issue to bed once and for all.\u201d </p> <p>She said ministers should also take a far tougher line on North Sea oil and gas production: \u201c[The] Scottish government has announced a climate emergency, and a growing movement is demanding it starts acting like it means it. That includes taking a much tougher stance with big, polluting corporations, ending its support for new oil and gas and using the powers it has to pass strong laws in the Scottish parliament to drive the transformative change we need.\u201d</p> <p>Alexander Burnett, for the Scottish Conservatives, accused Wheelhouse of hypocrisy, since ministers seemed to be happy for Ineos to import tens of thousands of tons of gas by tanker from fracking in the US for its plastics plants at Grangemouth.</p> <p>\u201cIt would appear that the Scottish National party support fracking where it doesn\u2019t cost them votes,\u201d Burnett said.</p>",

But Wheelhouse rejected calls from climate campaigners and Scottish Labour for fracking to be specifically outlawed by legislation in Scotland. He said the government\u2019s regulatory powers under its planning and licensing systems were strong enough. Promising the government could consider legislation if it was needed in future, Wheelhouse said fracking was incompatible with the Scottish parliament\u2019s new target of cutting climate emissions to net zero by 2045, which was passed by MSPs last week. \u201cThere has been a dramatic change in public perceptions of the environment, the climate crisis and the expectations of government to respond,\u201d he said. As a result \u201can unconventional oil and gas industry would not be of sufficient positive benefit to Scotland to outweigh its negative impacts\u201d. Claudia Beamish, Scottish Labour\u2019s environment spokeswoman, said that without legislation this ban could be overturned by another government in future. The ban formalises a moratorium first announced by the Scottish government in January 2015 after it came under intense pressure, fuelled by pro-independence activists and campaigns in Scottish National party target seats affected by fracking licences in central Scotland. It is understood there were strong reservations about a permanent ban from Fergus Ewing, the then energy minister, but in 2017 ministers confirmed the moratorium would continue. It led to a court challenge by the oil and chemicals giant Ineos, which runs the Grangemouth chemicals and oil refinery complex west of Edinburgh. The Scottish government won but its lawyers admitted in court that the moratorium did not amount to a formal ban. It was instead a policy of \u201cno support\u201d, a distinction which Wheelhouse repeated on Thursday. Mark Ruskell, the Scottish Greens climate spokesman, said ministers should now follow through by finally rejecting an application by Ineos dating from 2012 to produce coalbed methane near Airth. Wheelhouse said that application would now be decided and said the government\u2019s chief planner had written on Thursday to Scotland\u2019s 32 councils to tell them planning permission for any unconventional oil and gas project should now be refused. That planning direction would be underwritten in the next national planning framework, giving it statutory force. That is due to be passed by the Scottish parliament before the next Holyrood elections in May 2021, he added, but that could not be guaranteed. Mary Church from Friends of the Earth Scotland said: \u201cIt is frustrating that today\u2019s decision falls short of the full legal ban that would put the issue to bed once and for all.\u201d She said ministers should also take a far tougher line on North Sea oil and gas production: \u201c[The] Scottish government has announced a climate emergency, and a growing movement is demanding it starts acting like it means it. That includes taking a much tougher stance with big, polluting corporations, ending its support for new oil and gas and using the powers it has to pass strong laws in the Scottish parliament to drive the transformative change we need.\u201d Alexander Burnett, for the Scottish Conservatives, accused Wheelhouse of hypocrisy, since ministers seemed to be happy for Ineos to import tens of thousands of tons of gas by tanker from fracking in the US for its plastics plants at Grangemouth. \u201cIt would appear that the Scottish National party support fracking where it doesn\u2019t cost them votes,\u201d Burnett said.",

      "bodyText": "Selling arms to Saudi Arabia has been a hard drug for western governments to give up. Since entering the Yemen conflict in 2015 at the end of a coalition of Gulf monarchies, the kingdom has become the world\u2019s biggest weapons importer. In 2018 alone it spent nearly $70bn on arms, almost 9% of its GDP. The US is by far the biggest supplier, with about 70% of the market between 2014 and 2018, with the UK the second biggest, accounting for about a tenth of total Saudi purchases. There has been no shortage of evidence that western-supplied weaponry has been used to inflict mass civilian casualties. In a study of 27 attacks involving the deaths of Yemeni civilians published by Stanford Law School in March, 25 involved the use of a US weapon while UK weapons were used in five cases. The weapon dropped on a school bus killing 40 children in August 2018 was a US-made precision-guided Paveway bomb. In spite of repeated incidents of mass casualties, both countries have sought to press ahead with sales of their most sophisticated and expensive weaponry, while France has been trying to regain a market share. In June, the UK court of appeal ruled such sales unlawful, saying government ministers, including the current prime minister, Boris Johnson, had signed off on arms exports to Saudi without properly assessing the risk to civilians. Since then, the UK undertook to grant no further arms export licenses for Saudi sales, but had to apologise earlier this month for two breaches it said were \u201cinadvertent\u201d. In April this year, Congress made a bid to limit US involvement in the Yemen war. The gruesome murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in October 2018 deepened the congressional unease over the civilian death toll, which showed no signs of abating, despite administration promises that constant improvements in targeting were being made with US help. In April, a bipartisan bill was agreed by the House of Representatives and Senate to end US participation in the Yemen war, marking the first time Congress had invoked the 1973 War Powers Resolution to send a bill to the White House, calling on the president to take the US out of conflict. Trump vetoed the bill and its supporters failed to muster the two-thirds majority necessary to override it.",

      "body": "<p>The writer, actor and now director <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wellsdolly?lang=en\" title=\"\">Dolly Wells</a> moved to New York in the summer of 2014, leaving London, where she was born. It was for family reasons \u2013 her husband, who is half-American, missed home \u2013 but it coincided with a new phase of her career. That same year, the first season of the much-missed comedy <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2561882/\" title=\"\">Doll &amp; Em</a> aired on HBO. She wrote and starred in it with her best friend, Emily Mortimer, and after years as a largely comedy actor, it established her as a writer worthy of serious attention.</p> <p>Brooklyn gave her the material she needed to make her big-screen directorial debut, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/02/good-posture-review-dolly-wells-emily-mortimer\" title=\"\">Good Posture</a>. \u201cI felt in quite a bit of pain, moving to America, leaving my brothers and sisters, my mum, whatever my identity was,\u201d she says. \u201cTrying to work out if I would be a different person in this country.\u201d</p> <p>It is a brisk autumnal morning, and in a hotel in London, Wells, 47, nurses a hot chocolate. She talks quickly and broadly, pegging out each corner of any point she is making, before settling on a conclusion somewhere in the middle, as if resolving an imaginary argument. </p> <p>Good Posture is a beautiful, slender and pleasingly off-key story about Lilian, a young woman who moves in with a withdrawn and famous author, Julia, and decides to make a documentary about her without having read any of her books. Their unusual relationship, maternal and not, forms the backbone of the story. It was the first thing Wells \u2013 who also directed it \u2013 had written without Mortimer. Still, Mortimer appears in it, as Julia, who spends a lot of time hiding away unseen in her room. (This was partly for practical reasons: Mortimer, \u201cthe best person in the world\u201d, wanted to do it but only had three days, so Wells wrote her reclusiveness into the story.)</p> <p>Julia, the reluctant creator, is not the character Wells seems to identify with most, although you would be forgiven for thinking it might be, as getting the director to make Good Posture in the first place took some persuasion. She had worked with the director Jamie Adams on his 2014 film Black Mountain Poets. \u201cJamie said he thought I\u2019d be a good storyteller. He said: \u2018I think you should direct a film,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I kind of went: \u2018Mmm, I\u2019m all right, actually.\u2019 I knew since I was younger that I wanted to direct, but it\u2019s quite terrifying. I feel like: \u2018What is it I\u2019ve got to say that anyone wants to hear?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Undeterred, Adams asked her again a year later, having brought in Maggie Monteith, a producer who had found the money. \u201cHe said: \u2018I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll ask again if you say no a second time.\u2019 Quite clever. So I said: \u2018OK. I\u2019ll do it.\u2019\u201d Then Wells had to come up with a story. \u201cUp until now, I\u2019d only ever written with Emily. And I think we have different styles. Em was saying yesterday that she\u2019s really good at the plot and I\u2019m really good at the dialogue, but I\u2019m probably a bit more chaotic. Also, I quite like not telling everything, leaving bits out. That\u2019s the kind of films I enjoy.\u201d</p> <p>She knew she wanted to write a coming-of-age story about a young woman. A younger cousin had stayed with a writer in New York and she thought that was interesting. \u201cEmily\u2019s mother was asking me last night: \u2018How did you get the idea for the mother and daughter?\u2019 It sounds so weird, but I don\u2019t remember, and that often happens when I have ideas. I can remember knowing I had 35 days before we were going to shoot it, and trying to write it ...\u201d</p> <p>The shoot was in a month and she hadn\u2019t written anything? She nods, smiling. Does she normally leave things until the last minute? \u201cNo,\u201d she says, still nodding. \u201cA bit. Yes. With Doll &amp; Em, as well. I\u2019m not good without a deadline.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/02/good-posture-review-dolly-wells-emily-mortimer\">Good Posture review \u2013 coolly comic tale of love and lies</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Wells lights up most when talking about Lilian, the aimless woman at the centre of Good Posture, in her early 20s and desperately searching for purpose and love. It is a fond and tender portrait of a character who could have been insufferable. \u201cYeah, I love her. But people are horrified by her a bit, as well,\u201d she says. In one scene, Lilian brazenly uses Julia\u2019s toothbrush and towels. It is oddly uncomfortable to watch. \u201cI know! This is too much information, but we were laughing yesterday about how, when you\u2019re younger, you\u2019d use the loo,\u201d she leans in, \u201c<em>in a big way</em>, at somebody\u2019s house, and when you get older, you think: \u2018I won\u2019t.\u2019\u201d In her youth, Lilian is a little entitled and a little unfettered. \u201cIn a way, she\u2019s trying to be Julia, and she doesn\u2019t even know it. She\u2019s trying to be a grownup woman.\u201d</p> <p>Wells\u2019s father, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wells_(satirist)\" title=\"\">late satirist John Wells</a>, was an actor, and she speaks vividly of the \u201cpull of the excitement my dad was bringing into the house, the sparks, so I did obviously want that life\u201d. She started acting in her early 20s, although she has said in the past that she was not ambitious when she was younger. \u201cNo, I really wasn\u2019t. I just don\u2019t quite know how you get it right, all of this. Then you have moments like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/30/can-you-ever-forgive-me-review-melissa-mccarthy-richard-e-grant\" title=\"\">Can You Ever Forgive Me?</a>\u201d Wells was Anna, the bookshop assistant fleeced, wined and dined by Melissa McCarthy\u2019s author/forger Lee Israel. \u201cIt was a really beautiful little gem of a film,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s also really exciting that the story of [Israel], an angry, curmudgeonly, alcoholic, broke woman with no career, should be so interesting. There aren\u2019t enough stories like that.\u201d</p> <p>As with Doll &amp; Em, Good Posture is fluent on the peculiar intricacies of female friendships. Wells finds them fascinating and romantic. When she was younger, she says, there were areas of her life in which she would feel validated by men\u2019s approval. \u201cBut I think the real approval you get is through women, if you\u2019re heterosexual. Because if it\u2019s not a sexual relationship, you can get to the important parts. You\u2019re not holding something back.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Good Posture is released in the UK on 4 October</p>",

(This was partly for practical reasons: Mortimer, \u201cthe best person in the world\u201d, wanted to do it but only had three days, so Wells wrote her reclusiveness into the story.) Julia, the reluctant creator, is not the character Wells seems to identify with most, although you would be forgiven for thinking it might be, as getting the director to make Good Posture in the first place took some persuasion. She had worked with the director Jamie Adams on his 2014 film Black Mountain Poets. \u201cJamie said he thought I\u2019d be a good storyteller. He said: \u2018I think you should direct a film,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I kind of went: \u2018Mmm, I\u2019m all right, actually.\u2019 I knew since I was younger that I wanted to direct, but it\u2019s quite terrifying. I feel like: \u2018What is it I\u2019ve got to say that anyone wants to hear?\u2019\u201d Undeterred, Adams asked her again a year later, having brought in Maggie Monteith, a producer who had found the money. \u201cHe said: \u2018I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll ask again if you say no a second time.\u2019 Quite clever. So I said: \u2018OK. I\u2019ll do it.\u2019\u201d Then Wells had to come up with a story. \u201cUp until now, I\u2019d only ever written with Emily. And I think we have different styles. Em was saying yesterday that she\u2019s really good at the plot and I\u2019m really good at the dialogue, but I\u2019m probably a bit more chaotic. Also, I quite like not telling everything, leaving bits out. That\u2019s the kind of films I enjoy.\u201d She knew she wanted to write a coming-of-age story about a young woman. A younger cousin had stayed with a writer in New York and she thought that was interesting. \u201cEmily\u2019s mother was asking me last night: \u2018How did you get the idea for the mother and daughter?\u2019 It sounds so weird, but I don\u2019t remember, and that often happens when I have ideas. I can remember knowing I had 35 days before we were going to shoot it, and trying to write it ...\u201d The shoot was in a month and she hadn\u2019t written anything? She nods, smiling. Does she normally leave things until the last minute? \u201cNo,\u201d she says, still nodding. \u201cA bit. Yes. With Doll &amp; Em, as well. I\u2019m not good without a deadline.\u201d Wells lights up most when talking about Lilian, the aimless woman at the centre of Good Posture, in her early 20s and desperately searching for purpose and love. It is a fond and tender portrait of a character who could have been insufferable. \u201cYeah, I love her. But people are horrified by her a bit, as well,\u201d she says. In one scene, Lilian brazenly uses Julia\u2019s toothbrush and towels. It is oddly uncomfortable to watch. \u201cI know! This is too much information, but we were laughing yesterday about how, when you\u2019re younger, you\u2019d use the loo,\u201d she leans in, \u201cin a big way, at somebody\u2019s house, and when you get older, you think: \u2018I won\u2019t.\u2019\u201d In her youth, Lilian is a little entitled and a little unfettered. \u201cIn a way, she\u2019s trying to be Julia, and she doesn\u2019t even know it. She\u2019s trying to be a grownup woman.\u201d Wells\u2019s father, the late satirist John Wells, was an actor, and she speaks vividly of the \u201cpull of the excitement my dad was bringing into the house, the sparks, so I did obviously want that life\u201d. She started acting in her early 20s, although she has said in the past that she was not ambitious when she was younger. \u201cNo, I really wasn\u2019t. I just don\u2019t quite know how you get it right, all of this. Then you have moments like Can You Ever Forgive Me?\u201d Wells was Anna, the bookshop assistant fleeced, wined and dined by Melissa McCarthy\u2019s author/forger Lee Israel. \u201cIt was a really beautiful little gem of a film,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s also really exciting that the story of [Israel], an angry, curmudgeonly, alcoholic, broke woman with no career, should be so interesting. There aren\u2019t enough stories like that.\u201d As with Doll &amp; Em, Good Posture is fluent on the peculiar intricacies of female friendships. Wells finds them fascinating and romantic. When she was younger, she says, there were areas of her life in which she would feel validated by men\u2019s approval. \u201cBut I think the real approval you get is through women, if you\u2019re heterosexual. Because if it\u2019s not a sexual relationship, you can get to the important parts. You\u2019re not holding something back.\u201d \u2022 Good Posture is released in the UK on 4 October",

Guy Verhofstadt, the former prime minister of Belgium who coordinates the European parliament\u2019s Brexit steering group, said it was \u201cnearly impossible\u201d to see how a deal could be secured on the basis of the proposals. He pointed to a leaked script handed to Conservative MPs by the party, which instructed them to attack the EU as \u201ccrazy\u201d if it rejected proposals as an indication of Johnson\u2019s insincerity about wanting a deal. \u201cIf there is a Tory document saying that they have to blame the European Union then it\u2019s obvious that that is the purpose,\u201d he said. The prime minister had said in his letter to the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, accompanying the legal text of the UK\u2019s proposals for replacing the Irish backstop that his ideas amounted to a \u201cbroad landing zone\u201d for a deal. He will now be tested by the EU on how far he will compromise on the key areas of contention, in particular on the imposition of a customs border on the island of Ireland, a seeming red line for the new government.

The UK\u2019s suggestion of working out the details of how technology could be used to help with that during the Brexit transition period was said to be unacceptable. Johnson has proposed that Northern Ireland stay in the EU\u2019s single market for goods on the basis that Stormont agrees in a vote before the end of the transition period, and then every four years. The committee said this provided a unilateral right to exit arrangements that would create huge uncertainty for the Republic of Ireland. The MEPs said: \u201cThe right of consent being offered to the Northern Irish assembly effectively makes an agreement contingent, uncertain, provisional, unilateral, instead of the safety net provided for by the backstop. \u201cFurthermore, the Northern Irish assembly has not sat for nearly three years, and it is questionable whether it would be able to reconvene and take on the responsibility for an international treaty of this nature.\u201d The UK\u2019s negotiator, David Frost, is expected back in Brussels on Friday, possibly with the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay.

A movie star can always see his past on screen. What does that do to him?

Whatever I wanted, at any expense, was mine. It was like I was on a shopping spree. Anything goes! I\u2019m still proud of Hulk, but I underestimated the power of genre and how you have to wrestle with a general audience.\u201d</p> <p>I ask what he makes of Hulk\u2019s subsequent movie outings. \u201cI\u2019ve watched them on airplanes,\u201d he says sheepishly. \u201cSometimes with the sound down. I didn\u2019t really care that much. To do that kind of movie, you have to coat it with artifice. I didn\u2019t do that with my Hulk. I went at it straight, as though it was real. With Gemini Man, I\u2019m more aware of movie culture, more respectful of its power. When we are in a cinema, this collective imagination is like a religion. You can\u2019t explain it. That\u2019s the part of moviemaking that humbles you.

I\u2019m still proud of Hulk, but I underestimated the power of genre and how you have to wrestle with a general audience.\u201d I ask what he makes of Hulk\u2019s subsequent movie outings. \u201cI\u2019ve watched them on airplanes,\u201d he says sheepishly. \u201cSometimes with the sound down. I didn\u2019t really care that much. To do that kind of movie, you have to coat it with artifice. I didn\u2019t do that with my Hulk. I went at it straight, as though it was real. With Gemini Man, I\u2019m more aware of movie culture, more respectful of its power. When we are in a cinema, this collective imagination is like a religion. You can\u2019t explain it. That\u2019s the part of moviemaking that humbles you. You don\u2019t always get your way.\u201d Lee has so many rich and varied films behind him, most of them rightly celebrated (Sense and Sensibility, The Ice Storm, Crouching Tiger, Brokeback Mountain) and others still stubbornly underrated, such as Ride with the Devil, a US civil war movie that goes off on a rewarding tangent. Could it be that his best work still lies ahead? \u201cI would like to think so. My body will tell me. I\u2019m turning senior citizen soon. Sixty-five! It\u2019s hard to keep that creativity going. Energy and stamina and freshness relate to youth. I use the material to force me in new directions. My first thought when I saw this technology was: \u2018I wish I was 20 years younger.\u2019 I know I\u2019m gonna get beat up. But I have to keep trying. I\u2019m carrying a torch for the next level of film-makers.\u201d He looks to the ceiling, smiles faintly and makes one last plea to the movie god: \u201cWhy me?\u201d Gemini Man is released on 11 October",

But, as reported by the Guardian this week, the fact that details of his Papadopoulos chat ended up with the then US charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires in London, Elizabeth Dibble, did take Downer\u2019s Australian masters by surprise. The first Canberra knew about Downer\u2019s conversation with America\u2019s top diplomat in the UK was when the FBI asked for more information. For those who know Downer, best known in Australia for his gaffes, use of words like \u201cunctuous\u201d in normal discourse and an ill-advised photo wearing a pair of fishnet stockings and high heels for a charity promotion, cock-up has always come before conspiracy. He came by his born-to-rule mentality honestly, his conservative leanings passed on through the Downer line, along with height, high foreheads and clipped speech. His grandfather, Sir John Downer, served two terms as the premier of South Australia \u2013 the Australian state which likes to boast of its free settler beginnings in a land colonised by convicts \u2013 before heading to the federal Senate in 1901.

Here was a young dramatist making a moving comedy out of a taboo subject: the strains on a marriage of bringing up a severely disabled child.

The first half of Nichols\u2019s play, in which we see parents Bri and Sheila adopting various defence mechanisms to cope with the situation, now arouses only fitful laughter. The couple engage in various forms of roleplay, with Bri sending up the deficiencies of the medical and clerical professions and memorably describing God as \u201ca sort of manic-depressive rugby footballer\u201d.

Toby Stephens, who gives an excellent performance, takes a different tack. He is momentarily funny as when, assuming the role of a hands-on vicar, he edges ever closer to Claire Skinner\u2019s Sheila.

There\u2019s a revealing moment when Sheila says of her husband \u201che lives with despair\u201d.

In one of the many direct addresses to the audience that are a trademark Nichols touch, Skinner also demonstrates that Sheila is the more perceptive marital partner: she pins down perfectly Bri\u2019s self-pity and, comparing her husband and daughter, says she doesn\u2019t know who is the greater baby.</p> <p>But, while the Bri-Sheila scenes are painfully good, it is with the arrival of the three other characters that the production achieves true hilarity.

      "bodyText": "The light walls of Nina Gross\u2019s west London home are filled with artworks paying tribute to her sister Alice, who was murdered in 2014. Gross, 24, an artist and upholsterer, says that creative endeavours are the only means by which she can find a way through her grief about the loss of her sister at the age of 14. Alice was murdered by Arnis Zalkalns, a Latvian man who lived in the UK and had murdered his wife but whose criminal record did not emerge before he killed Alice. While Nina\u2019s art helps her to process her own loss, she says she fears that the UK\u2019s exit from the EU could risk more families finding themselves in the same position. Five years after Alice\u2019s death, Gross is giving her first interview to warn that the loss of access to vital international criminal databases, which document crimes like those of Zalkalns, could allow other violent and sexual offenders to slip through the net. \u201cWe are talking about a very small number of people who have committed violent and sexual offences,\u201d Gross says. \u201cIf we leave the EU without a deal people will be put at risk. We need some sort of guarantee that we will continue to be part of the system we\u2019re part of at the moment. We need a proactive rather than a reactive system.\u201d The databases the UK currently has access to include ECRIS \u2013 the European Criminal Record Information System \u2013 and Europol allows UK police and immigration officials access to information about violent killers and sex offenders, and vice versa. If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, access will end. But amid discussion of food shortages and medical hold-ups, the security implications of that fact have been lower on the agenda. Gross fears that women and girls will be disproportionately affected if the monitoring system for this small but highly dangerous group of offenders is abandoned. She and her family are at pains to emphasise that they support freedom of movement and are profoundly dismayed that Alice\u2019s case has been exploited for what they view as xenophobic purposes. She and her parents, Jose Gross and Rosalind Hodgkiss, believe that Alice\u2019s murder was hijacked by Johnson and Michael Gove who, in March 2016 as part of the Vote Leave campaign, published a dossier of 50 violent criminals who they claimed were able to come to the UK and commit crimes as a result of EU freedom of movement. Alice\u2019s killer was one of them. Despite the dossier\u2019s implication that leaving the EU would prevent the threat of these violent individuals reaching our shores, Leave campaigners said nothing about how losing access to the EU criminal databases could actually increase rather than reduce the risk of violent individuals coming to the UK unchecked. \u201cBoris Johnson and Michael Gove were happy to use Alice\u2019s case but they haven\u2019t done anything about this issue,\u201d says Gross. \u201cI know that some people who voted to leave the EU will have been influenced by this list of 50 criminals. I want reassurances about how citizens will be protected if we fall out of ECRIS and Europol. The government has not been honest about this.\u201d Alice is thought to have been murdered in the late afternoon of 28 August 2014 while out for a walk. Her body was found 34 days later on the bed of the shallow river Brent in Hanwell, Ealing, having been intentionally weighted down and concealed. Scotland Yard launched a huge search for her. Zalkalns killed himself shortly afterwards. At the time of Alice\u2019s murder, the effectiveness of the system for checking convictions of foreign nationals was, according to the presiding coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox, \u201climited by inconsistent levels of cooperation from such authorities and their policies on retention of criminal data\u201d. The coroner made recommendations, and levels of EU-wide cooperation and data-sharing have improved. Amber Rudd, then home secretary, provided a five-page response in September 2016. She stated: \u201cWhilst it would be wrong to set out unilateral positions in advance of negotiations on options for future cooperation arrangements once the UK has left the EU, we will do what is necessary to keep people safe to ensure we have robust criminal records sharing arrangements in place when we leave the EU.\u201d Three years after that letter was written there is still no clarity about what those arrangements will be. \u201cI don\u2019t want another coroner to have to rule in the way a coroner did following Alice\u2019s death,\u201d Gross says.

      "body": "<p>Becky Downie is in the midst of describing every thought and every feeling she has during her absurd uneven bar routine, one of the most difficult in the world, when she pauses for a second and sighs: \u201cIt blows my mind every day once I\u2019ve done a bar routine, what I do, because you do so much in such a short space of time.\u201d</p> <p>Downie is speaking as the British team make their final preparations for the Gymnastics World Championships in Stuttgart which begin on Friday. The 27-year-old has spent much of the morning in Lilleshall, the home of British Gymnastics, constantly repeating the hardest part of the routine \u2013 three connected <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B2re4U3ADzX/\" title=\"\">skills</a> so blindingly fast that even her rivals stop to watch. In only a couple of seconds, Downie circles the top bar and leaps into the air, half-twisting as she catches the bar backwards. As the swing propels her backwards, she twists again as she throws herself down to the bottom bar before immediately flying back to the top.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/28/aurora-games-womens-sports-business-model\">'It's a start': Can the Aurora Games create a new model for women's sports?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The connection was invented by Beth Tweddle, Britain\u2019s greatest female gymnast, and it is widely considered one of the most difficult in the world. Downie believes it can drive her to secure the world or Olympic uneven bar medal she has been chasing for 12 years.</p> <p>For many other gymnasts, just the first skill alone, the Tweddle, is impossible. When I ask Ellie Downie, Becky\u2019s sister and the 2017 European all around champion, if she has ever tried the Tweddle, she laughs in my face: \u201cWe debated trying that but I can barely hang in that grip because I\u2019m just too stiff.\u201d Alice Kinsella, who won the European title on beam this year, simply closes her eyes and shakes her head: \u201cI\u2019ve never tried it. People say: \u2018Will I try it?\u2019 But I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s for me. Like, no. I think I\u2019ll stick with the normal one.\u201d</p> <p>Downie\u2019s abnormal skill selection complements a career that has been far from regular. For a while, it seemed like it would be defined by her bitter 2012, where after being Britain\u2019s second-in-command behind Tweddle for five years, the first major team she did not make was for her home Olympics. Downie was distraught, but in hindsight the snub lit a fire within. \u201cThat was heartbreaking because I had never not made a team in my career until that point,\u201d she says. \u201cThat was really hard to take. But, for me, after that it was like: \u2018OK how do I stop that from happening again? You have to be so good that they can\u2019t not put you on a team.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>For seven years, Downie has been <em>that</em> good. After being known for much of her career as a supreme talent who struggled to maintain her composure with major medals on the line, her moment of reckoning came when she won the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/may/18/downie-gold-bars-european-artistic-gymnastics-championships\" title=\"\">European championships on uneven bars</a> in 2014, beating the Olympic champion Aliya Mustafina before retaining her title in 2016. When Great Britain confirmed their rise to the upper echelons of the sport by winning team bronze at the 2015 world championships, Downie was the leader and the team\u2019s rock.</p> <p>Downie arrived at the 2016 Rio Olympics in the form of her life and with a great chance of finally winning her first medal. Instead, another Olympics left her heartbroken. Her <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aZcmFKPsGg\" title=\"\">routine</a> in the preliminary rounds was excellent except for one freak error \u2013 her toe brushed the top bar, incurring one huge deduction. Without the deduction, she would have outscored the eventual bronze medalist. Instead, she left Brazil wondering if she had the strength to carry on.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9fc7eb97084e67fcacd1d7ebb89643c3b35db2dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9fc7eb97084e67fcacd1d7ebb89643c3b35db2dd/92_0_3676_2206/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Becky Downie on her way to winning silver in the uneven bars during the 2019 European Games in Minsk.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Becky Downie on her way to winning silver in the uneven bars during the 2019 European Games in Minsk.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA Wire/PA Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAfter Rio, I was heavily debating retiring. When I had time to process it all and look back [I realised] it wasn\u2019t because I wasn\u2019t good enough.</p> <p>\u201cFor me, the most frustrating thing was that I beat the Olympic champion, Aliya Mustafina, eight weeks before at the European championships. So, it was there, the routine was there \u2013 I had to process that and think: \u2018You were good enough.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Downie\u2019s latest battle has been the toughest injury of her career. After years of considering surgery to fix the fraying ligaments in her left elbow, she fell <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XR2h4MO6JvU\" title=\"\">badly</a> at the 2017 European championships and the ligaments snapped. When the doctors informed her that her elbow would have to undergo full reconstructive surgery, she wept: \u201cThere was a point where I was like: \u2018I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ever going to be able to do this again.

      "bodyText": "Becky Downie is in the midst of describing every thought and every feeling she has during her absurd uneven bar routine, one of the most difficult in the world, when she pauses for a second and sighs: \u201cIt blows my mind every day once I\u2019ve done a bar routine, what I do, because you do so much in such a short space of time.\u201d Downie is speaking as the British team make their final preparations for the Gymnastics World Championships in Stuttgart which begin on Friday. The 27-year-old has spent much of the morning in Lilleshall, the home of British Gymnastics, constantly repeating the hardest part of the routine \u2013 three connected skills so blindingly fast that even her rivals stop to watch. In only a couple of seconds, Downie circles the top bar and leaps into the air, half-twisting as she catches the bar backwards. As the swing propels her backwards, she twists again as she throws herself down to the bottom bar before immediately flying back to the top. The connection was invented by Beth Tweddle, Britain\u2019s greatest female gymnast, and it is widely considered one of the most difficult in the world. Downie believes it can drive her to secure the world or Olympic uneven bar medal she has been chasing for 12 years. For many other gymnasts, just the first skill alone, the Tweddle, is impossible. When I ask Ellie Downie, Becky\u2019s sister and the 2017 European all around champion, if she has ever tried the Tweddle, she laughs in my face: \u201cWe debated trying that but I can barely hang in that grip because I\u2019m just too stiff.\u201d Alice Kinsella, who won the European title on beam this year, simply closes her eyes and shakes her head: \u201cI\u2019ve never tried it. People say: \u2018Will I try it?\u2019 But I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s for me. Like, no. I think I\u2019ll stick with the normal one.\u201d Downie\u2019s abnormal skill selection complements a career that has been far from regular. For a while, it seemed like it would be defined by her bitter 2012, where after being Britain\u2019s second-in-command behind Tweddle for five years, the first major team she did not make was for her home Olympics. Downie was distraught, but in hindsight the snub lit a fire within. \u201cThat was heartbreaking because I had never not made a team in my career until that point,\u201d she says. \u201cThat was really hard to take. But, for me, after that it was like: \u2018OK how do I stop that from happening again? You have to be so good that they can\u2019t not put you on a team.\u2019\u201d For seven years, Downie has been that good. After being known for much of her career as a supreme talent who struggled to maintain her composure with major medals on the line, her moment of reckoning came when she won the European championships on uneven bars in 2014, beating the Olympic champion Aliya Mustafina before retaining her title in 2016. When Great Britain confirmed their rise to the upper echelons of the sport by winning team bronze at the 2015 world championships, Downie was the leader and the team\u2019s rock. Downie arrived at the 2016 Rio Olympics in the form of her life and with a great chance of finally winning her first medal. Instead, another Olympics left her heartbroken. Her routine in the preliminary rounds was excellent except for one freak error \u2013 her toe brushed the top bar, incurring one huge deduction. Without the deduction, she would have outscored the eventual bronze medalist. Instead, she left Brazil wondering if she had the strength to carry on. \u201cAfter Rio, I was heavily debating retiring. When I had time to process it all and look back [I realised] it wasn\u2019t because I wasn\u2019t good enough. \u201cFor me, the most frustrating thing was that I beat the Olympic champion, Aliya Mustafina, eight weeks before at the European championships. So, it was there, the routine was there \u2013 I had to process that and think: \u2018You were good enough.\u2019\u201d Downie\u2019s latest battle has been the toughest injury of her career. After years of considering surgery to fix the fraying ligaments in her left elbow, she fell badly at the 2017 European championships and the ligaments snapped. When the doctors informed her that her elbow would have to undergo full reconstructive surgery, she wept: \u201cThere was a point where I was like: \u2018I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ever going to be able to do this again. If my elbow is not fully fixed, uneven bars is my piece so it\u2019s game over.\u2019 After initially being upset, I had to believe that it was going to get better. I was so over the top with my rehab! Every single hour I was icing it \u2026 I went into the gym within a couple of days after and was getting every other body part as strong as it could be so when I came back I could comeback well and quickly.\u201d In order to return to gymnastics, Downie had to learn basic aspects of the sport anew. There was a time when just gripping the bar marked supreme progress. Her left side has always dominated her gymnastics, but her wonky left elbow meant that her comeback rested on learning how to twist to the right for the first time in her life. Now she has made it back, 2019 seems like a full-circle moment. In 2007, she made her world championship debut in Stuttgart, when the British team qualified for the Beijing Olympics and their era of success began. She returns as a seasoned veteran with a wealth of experience and a team no longer content with making up the numbers. She is desperate to draw from both failures and successes as she resumes her chase for the elusive medal. \u201cIt has been a mad process getting the bar routine together and how it\u2019s all come about, but I\u2019m excited to give it a go. It has been a process, it has been a journey, but it has been awesome.\u201d",

Some secrets were explained in spinoffs, but enough was left unanswered to give kids work to do on fan forums. One mystery involving a sugar bowl was so enduring that there were endless threads dedicated to it; when I interviewed Handler in 2017, he said that \u201cif you watched as the series came to a conclusion, you could basically see an entire internet being built around people curious about the sugar bowl\u201d.

He took his readers seriously. Where Harry Potter was aggressively simplistic, Handler used devices such as alliteration and repetition to the point of absurdity, while referencing everything from Shakespeare to Melville.

It\u2019s one of the reasons for their wickedness\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/07/how-old-child-need-be-appreciate-lemony-snicket-daniel-handler-interview\">Daniel Handler: \u2018How old does a child need to be to\u00a0appreciate Lemony Snicket?\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While the series appealed to adults, the books always prioritised children. The Baudelaires are shown to be innovative and independent, as many child heroes often are, but Handler reminded us that they shouldn\u2019t have to be so resourceful. A Series of Unfortunate Events isn\u2019t just about the bravery of the children, but the failures of adults. It\u2019s about the grey area between bona fide villains and useless good guys who don\u2019t speak out about the abuses they witness. We are taught, too, that even good adults, such as The Bad Beginning\u2019s Justice Strauss or The Vile Village\u2019s Hector, will let their own self-interest get in the way and fail the children in their care. There is no easy division between good and evil, as one character notes: \u201cPeople aren\u2019t either wicked or noble. They\u2019re like chef\u2019s salads, with good things and bad things chopped and mixed together.\u201d As the series progressed, it began to deal with moral relativism, as the orphans commit the same atrocities as their enemies to different ends. There was always room for multiple readings, with Handler revealing in 2007 that the Baudelaires are Jewish. \u201cI think there is something naturally Jewish about unending misery,\u201d he told <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20110726173206/http://momentmag.com/moment/issues/2007/02/200702-Handler.html\">Moment</a>. Part of the series\u2019 longevity is due to the fact that it is endlessly interpretable, easily revisited by fans now in adulthood.</p> <p>A Series of Unfortunate Events entered my life when I was just seven. I was a voracious reader, and a terminally lonely one, partly as a result of the former. It taught me that my own thoughts could be trusted, that my impulses to read and make things were not unusual, to find joy and sanctuary where there was none. It didn\u2019t have happy endings, sure, but it reinforced what I already knew: they\u2019re not always what we need.</p>",

It\u2019s about the grey area between bona fide villains and useless good guys who don\u2019t speak out about the abuses they witness. We are taught, too, that even good adults, such as The Bad Beginning\u2019s Justice Strauss or The Vile Village\u2019s Hector, will let their own self-interest get in the way and fail the children in their care. There is no easy division between good and evil, as one character notes: \u201cPeople aren\u2019t either wicked or noble. They\u2019re like chef\u2019s salads, with good things and bad things chopped and mixed together.\u201d As the series progressed, it began to deal with moral relativism, as the orphans commit the same atrocities as their enemies to different ends. There was always room for multiple readings, with Handler revealing in 2007 that the Baudelaires are Jewish. \u201cI think there is something naturally Jewish about unending misery,\u201d he told Moment. Part of the series\u2019 longevity is due to the fact that it is endlessly interpretable, easily revisited by fans now in adulthood. A Series of Unfortunate Events entered my life when I was just seven. I was a voracious reader, and a terminally lonely one, partly as a result of the former. It taught me that my own thoughts could be trusted, that my impulses to read and make things were not unusual, to find joy and sanctuary where there was none. It didn\u2019t have happy endings, sure, but it reinforced what I already knew: they\u2019re not always what we need.",

Lampard knows there is pressure from above, a demand for trophies, even if Chelsea are building for the future. He needs his players to have that edge and Hudson-Odoi found it against Lille. It is up to Pulisic to follow suit.",

      "body": "<p>Last year, the famous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/15/elvis-1968-comeback-special-review-film-concert\">1968 Elvis Presley TV comeback special</a> was released in cinemas to mark its 50th anniversary. Now here\u2019s a superfluous documentary featuring outtakes from that film\u2019s live sets. Rolling Stone recently described Elvis\u2019s performance in the show as one of the greatest in rock\u2019n\u2019roll history. The King himself was reportedly so shook up by it that he ejaculated into his leather trousers. But I couldn\u2019t help feeling underwhelmed, vaguely repelled even by his preening, smirky stage presence.</p> <p>In 1968, Elvis hadn\u2019t performed live in seven years after switching to movies, acting in a succession of increasingly ropey productions. For the TV comeback he performed two unplugged sets plus two accompanied by a 45-piece orchestra, dressed throughout in uncomfy skintight black leather, chest exposed, hair slicked back. At 33, he\u2019s still looking good \u2013 the days of bloated Vegas Elvis are still to come. But bequiffed and crooning \u201cDo the chairs in your parlour seem empty and bare?\u201d he must have looked seriously quaint to the youthful rebels of 1968.</p> <p>Still, the TV show was a triumph, proof that the King still had it. And there are some heartstopping moments in the acoustic sets as he jams rhythm and blues with his original bandmates, guitarist Scotty Moore and drummer DJ Fontana. But to be honest, the performance is all swagger and no soul, with Elvis displaying the spoilt petulant air of a man with a large entourage to maintain. And there is something stagey about his interactions with the audience \u2013 at one point asking for a handkerchief from a woman in the front row to mop his brow. I\u2019d much rather watch the beautiful boy of 1956 shaping rock\u2019n\u2019roll with his sexually charged performances. This looks a bit like asking the Johnny Depp of today to act the role of Edward Scissorhands.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Last year, the famous 1968 Elvis Presley TV comeback special was released in cinemas to mark its 50th anniversary. Now here\u2019s a superfluous documentary featuring outtakes from that film\u2019s live sets. Rolling Stone recently described Elvis\u2019s performance in the show as one of the greatest in rock\u2019n\u2019roll history. The King himself was reportedly so shook up by it that he ejaculated into his leather trousers. But I couldn\u2019t help feeling underwhelmed, vaguely repelled even by his preening, smirky stage presence. In 1968, Elvis hadn\u2019t performed live in seven years after switching to movies, acting in a succession of increasingly ropey productions. For the TV comeback he performed two unplugged sets plus two accompanied by a 45-piece orchestra, dressed throughout in uncomfy skintight black leather, chest exposed, hair slicked back. At 33, he\u2019s still looking good \u2013 the days of bloated Vegas Elvis are still to come. But bequiffed and crooning \u201cDo the chairs in your parlour seem empty and bare?\u201d he must have looked seriously quaint to the youthful rebels of 1968. Still, the TV show was a triumph, proof that the King still had it. And there are some heartstopping moments in the acoustic sets as he jams rhythm and blues with his original bandmates, guitarist Scotty Moore and drummer DJ Fontana. But to be honest, the performance is all swagger and no soul, with Elvis displaying the spoilt petulant air of a man with a large entourage to maintain. And there is something stagey about his interactions with the audience \u2013 at one point asking for a handkerchief from a woman in the front row to mop his brow. I\u2019d much rather watch the beautiful boy of 1956 shaping rock\u2019n\u2019roll with his sexually charged performances. This looks a bit like asking the Johnny Depp of today to act the role of Edward Scissorhands.",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from me - I\u2019ll leave you with Andy Bull\u2019s report from Kobe. Thanks for joining me. Cheerio. Ireland go top of Pool A, and are in a three-way scrap with Japan and Scotland to make the quarter-finals. Win against Samoa with a bonus point, and they\u2019re through - but whether or not they win the group is out of their hands. Joe Schmidt says Johnny Sexton doesn\u2019t have any new injury concerns. \u201cIt was tactical [to take him off]. Forty minutes this week, 40-60 next week, and he\u2019ll be just fine for the quarter-finals.\u201d He also brushes off concerns about the ice pack Sexton had on his thigh. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to cover his bases with the ice, he could have played on.\u201d He\u2019s positive about the performance, blaming \u201cthe conditions - the ball was slipping through our hands like a bar of soap,\u201d and added that Ireland showed enough going forward for him to feel satisfied. Sexton was keen to put a positive spin on things, but Brian O\u2019Driscoll in the ITV studio isn\u2019t buying it. \u201cEighteen handling errors is far too many from Ireland.\u201d Paul O\u2019Connell adds that Ireland simply aren\u2019t creating enough, pointing to France and New Zealand\u2019s performances yesterday. Here\u2019s Johnny Sexton: \u201cPicking up the bonus point was exactly what we were looking for. Russia were well-organised, and made things really difficult. The ball was really slippy out there. Happy to get the five points, plenty to work on before Samoa.\u201d He also thanks the Irish fans, but somewhat frustratingly, he isn\u2019t asked about his injury. It does seem that he was taken off as a precaution, nothing more. Job done for Ireland, as they stagger away from a bruising contest with the necessary five points. It wasn\u2019t the statement win they craved, but the conditions and opposition made things tough for Joe Schmidt\u2019s side. 79 mins: Ringrose thinks he\u2019s scored again, but the TMO chalks it off for a \u201cclear knock on\u201d. It wasn\u2019t all that clear, in my humble opinion. Rhys Ruddock gets man of the match, just reward for a battling performance in the back row. Here\u2019s the flourish Ireland have been looking for, Carty\u2019s steal setting up a lightning break downfield. Larmour exchanges passes with Earls then offloads to Ringrose, who gallops clear to score. Carty converts. 74 mins: Ireland 28-0 Russia A nice attacking move from Ireland, with O\u2019Mahony, Aki and Conway combining - but the ball slips away, another handling error costing them. 73 mins: Ireland 28-0 Russia Larmour kicks the ball into touch, and Ireland turn it over from the Russian lineout. No gaps in the wall of red though, even at this late stage. 70 mins: Ireland 28-0 Russia Roman Khodin comes on for Russia, who have been really impressive despite the scoreline. 68 mins: Ireland 28-0 Russia Ireland have a little of their swagger back now, and CJ Stander powers through a tackle to haul them close to the line. Ruddock so nearly gets a second try, but a Russian body hauls him back behind the line - and Henderson\u2019s spill allows Perov to hurriedly clear away. 65 mins: Ireland 28-0 Russia A bit of magic from Carty and Earls there, after what has been, if I\u2019m honest, an awful second half. Russia launch an attack, but Artemyev\u2019s kick through is well-fielded by the dependable Earls. That\u2019s a big relief for Ireland. Carty\u2019s cute chip kick forward is gathered in by Earls, who offloads superbly under pressure to Conway - and the wing bursts clear! Bonus point secured, and Carty converts. 60 mins: Ireland 21-0 Russia Gaisin\u2019s kick is charged down by Ringrose, but Ireland can\u2019t profit from it. Iain Henderson is on for Kleyn, and Ostrikov will be back shortly. Ireland haven\u2019t been able to use that man advantage - yet ... 59 mins: Ireland 21-0 Russia Ireland change their entire front row. Kilcoyne, Scannell and Ryan retire after a bruising hour, with Leinster\u2019s trio of Cronin, Porter and Furlong on. 57 mins: Ireland 21-0 Russia Another Russian penalty, and Gaisin goes for goal from distance. It\u2019s a tough kick, and he pulls it a long way wide. Sexton is now applying ice to his thigh - a worrying sight for Irish fans. I would agree - a lot of games have been closer than the final score suggests. Russia are one of the tournament\u2019s outsiders, but they\u2019re making life really difficult for Ireland today. But that might not always translate to the casual fan, tuning in to see a one-sided score in the top left of their screen. 54 mins: Ireland 21-0 Russia German Davydov, the hefty Russian wing, joins the scrum to add much-needed muscle. Ireland have lost momentum here, and that bright start feels a long time ago. 52 mins: Ireland 21-0 Russia Sexton is on the Irish bench, and doesn\u2019t appear to be nursing an injury. Russia have done a great job of dragging Ireland into the trenches in this half, but can they hold out with a man missing? 51 mins: Ireland 21-0 Russia From the lineout, the new man Ostrikov clatters John Ryan, rocking his head back. Could the substitute be heading straight off? No - Garces rules that Ryan was low, and Ostrikov led with his arm, so it\u2019s a yellow. 50 mins: Ireland 21-0 Russia Kearney\u2019s kick gives Artemyev, his former schools opponent, too much time. The Russian\u2019s kick is terrific, rolling into touch five metres out. Jordan Larmour is on for Kearney, while Ostrikov replaces Garbuzov for Russia. 49 mins: Ireland 21-0 Russia Fine work from the Irish pack to turn the ball over, and make up for that run of errors. They have a scrum, and a chance to clear their lines. 47 mins: Ireland 21-0 Russia Aki\u2019s knock-on from a high ball gives Russia a scrum, which Ireland collapse. Gaisin kicks for touch, and Russia have decent field position here ... 46 mins: Ireland 21-0 Russia Fedotko is back on in time for a Russian scrum. Early handling errors from Ireland have the commentary team frustrated - but surely the slippery conditions are a big factor. 44 mins: Ireland 21-0 Russia Ireland pour forward, Garry Ringrose stretching the Russian defence with Fedotko still off the field. The break is denied by Gotovstev, who makes a crunching tackle, and Russia turn it over. 42 mins: Ireland 21-0 Russia Changes in the front row for Russia, with Selskii and Morozov coming in. Still waiting for any news on Sexton\u2019s withdrawal. Jack Carty is on in place of Johnny Sexton. Not sure if Sexton has an injury, or is just being rested. Here\u2019s some team news ahead of England v Argentina on Saturday. Lucas Mensa sounds a clever player ... Harsh but fair? Here\u2019s Niall Connolly, with some half-time Blackrock memories. \u201cMy father, Aidan (from Banbridge), went to Castleknock and played in the Senior Cup final in 1948 losing to Blackrock 9-0. \u201cHis brother, Denis, played in the winning Castleknock side in 1947 against Blackrock, winning 6-0. Blackrock would seem to have the edge over the years in that school rivalry. But a little family history.\u201d A big lead, and three of the four tries required for a bonus point. Ireland will be happy with that. 39 mins: Igor Galiovskiy is caught offside trying to intercept, and Ireland have a lineout seconds before the gong - but Bundee Aki spills it. 38 mins: Ireland 21-0 Russia Gaisin goes for an ambitious drop goal to get Russia on the board, but it falls short, and was going wide anyway. Ireland have to get over here, with the giant Fedotko off the field. It isn\u2019t pretty by any means, but they get it done. Three green shirts converge on Sychev and Ruddock scrambles over! Sexton adds the extras. 33 mins: Ireland 14-0 Russia Bogdan Fedotko\u2019s difficult day continues - he gets a yellow card for a series of transgressions as Russia desperately try to keep Ireland from the line. Penalty advantage, but Sexton\u2019s floated pass to Conway is forward, so we come back for the scrum ... 32 mins: Ireland 14-0 Russia The Russians are giving too many penalties away, the latest presenting Ireland with a lineout 10m out. They would love a third try just now ... 29 mins: Ireland 14-0 Russia From a Russian scrum, Gaisin skips forward and delivers a dart of a kick into touch. Ireland pegged back a little, but they win the lineout. Russian scrum-half Dmitry Perov is too eager to try and intercept McGrath\u2019s offload, and gets penalised. 27 mins: Ireland 14-0 Russia Bad news for Ireland as Jordi Murphy, who only flew out on Sunday, is forced off. CJ Stander comes off the bench, but the back row injuries are mounting. 25 mins: Ireland 14-0 Russia Russia have the lineout, but Gaisin slips as he tries to clear, and the ball ricochets off O\u2019Mahony. It\u2019s a knock on. Conditions look so slippery out there now. 24 mins: Ireland 14-0 Russia A shake of the head from Sexton after he opts to kick for touch, with Russia scrambling to get back ... 23 mins: Ireland 14-0 Russia Fedotko is guilty of another mistake, with Conway just unable to take advantage with a burst down the right flank. 21 mins: Ireland 14-0 Russia They are just about held up at the line, Rhys Ruddock almost forcing the ball over, but Russia are penalised. Sexton kicks out, but from the lineout, Kilcoyne concedes a penalty and Russia, who look absolutely exhausted, survive. 19 mins: Ireland 14-0 Russia Gaisin\u2019s clearance is a little short, and Ireland have the lineout on the Russian 22. A chance to roll forward, and roll they do, to within 10m ... 17 mins: Ireland 14-0 Russia Sexton looks up for this, and his crossfield kick almost picks out Earls, up against three Russians, who collectively just about deal with it. 15 mins: Ireland 14-0 Russia Ireland\u2019s minimum requirement today is four tries and a bonus-point win: they\u2019re halfway there already. 14 mins: Ireland 14-0 Russia Another blow for Russia, as Golosnitskiy hurts his knee trying to deny O\u2019Mahony, and clattering into the post. He\u2019s replaced by Vladimir Ostroushko. A handling error presents Ireland with possession deep in Russian territory, and Sexton pounces, his grubber kick slicing open the defence and allowing O\u2019Mahony to run through and slide into the left-hand post. Sexton converts, and Ireland are in control. 12 mins: Ireland 7-0 Russia Ireland scrum - their front five today are all Munster men - from which Russia are penalised, and Sexton can kick clear. 10 mins: Ireland 7-0 Russia Gaisin launches a high ball towards the corner and Kearney, perhaps dazzled by the lights, loses it! He\u2019s forced to bundle it into touch, but Matveev\u2019s lineout isn\u2019t straight. An opportunity missed for the underdogs. 8 mins: Ireland 7-0 Russia Peter O\u2019Mahony dives in to grab the ball at the breakdown, but Ireland are caught offside. Russia have a lineout, and work the ball right to left, and back again ... 6 mins: Ireland 7-0 Russia Conway slips as he looks to skip forward - already signs that there\u2019s plenty of moisture under the dome in Kobe. 5 mins: Ireland 7-0 Russia Russia turn the ball over as McGrath\u2019s kick has them scrambling, Gaisin slipping into touch under pressure - but Russia nick the lineout ball. That didn\u2019t take long. From the Ireland lineout, Rob Kearney finds a gap and has too much power and pace for Simplikevich, who can\u2019t keep him from forcing his way over. Sexton\u2019s conversion sneaks inside the right post. 1 min: An exchange of kicks, before Russian fly-half Ramil Gaisin finds touch. Jerome Garces is the man in the middle. Russia, decked out in all-red, kick things off. While you wait for kick-off, here\u2019s this week\u2019s Breakdown from the ever-excellent Paul Rees: Here\u2019s Joe Schmidt: \u201cJoey just had a bit of ankle soreness after the Captain\u2019s Run, and Conor Murray is keen to get back in there, which makes it easier. Johnny Sexton is fit, Japan came a bit too soon but he\u2019s had a comfortable turnaround. The first 20 minutes against Japan was very good, but we became hesitant, quite anxious. I\u2019d like to replicate that start, but build on it today.\u201d Johnny Sexton captains Ireland for the first time today, and has told ITV that he\u2019s \u201c100% fit\u201d. \u201cWe know we can get back to the level we showed against Scotland,\u201d he says. \u201cJapan was just a blip\u201d. Some intriguing pre-game reading from Ben Ryan, on how Ireland and others can bounce back from a defeat by sticking to the plan: A couple of names to look out for: for Ireland, Jordi Murphy starts at eight, having flown out to Japan earlier this week after Jack Conan was injured. For Russia, captain and full-back Vasily Artemyev, who played for Blackrock school in Leinster, and was even called up by Ireland\u2019s under-19 side, before opting to play for the country of his birth. In today\u2019s early kick-off, Fiji earned their first win of the tournament, brushing Georgia aside in a 45-10 win: Some breaking team news - Joey Carbery is a late withdrawal from the bench. Conor Murray takes his place, having originally been rested. Ireland: Kearney, Conway, Ringrose, Aki, Earls, Sexton (c), McGrath; Kilcoyne, Scannell, Ryan, Beirne, Kleyn, Ruddock, O\u2019Mahony, Murphy. Replacements: Cronin, Porter, Furlong, Henderson, Stander, Murray, Carty, Larmour. Russia: Artemyev (c), Davydov, Galinovskiy, Golosnitskiy, Simplikevich, Gaisin, Perov; Polivalov, Matveev, Gotovtsev, Garbuzov, Fedotko, Sychev, Gadzhiev, Gresev. Replacements: Selskii, Morozov, Podrezov, Ostrikov, Elgin, Ianiushkin, Khodin, Ostroushko. Time for Plan B, then. Ireland\u2019s meticulously crafted route to an overdue World Cup breakthrough did not account for events in Shizuoka, where Japan made the world\u2019s top-ranked team look distinctly second best. What does it change? On paper, not much. Two bonus-point wins and they will escape their pool and reach the quarter-finals, where a southern hemisphere titan awaits. In reality, everything is different now. Take today\u2019s game, which should have been a chance to ease through the gears against Pool A\u2019s lowest-ranked team. Instead, there will be scrutiny on this reshuffled side\u2019s every move, and the need for bonus points will bring its own pressure. Perhaps the return of talisman Johnny Sexton will ease Irish worries. Perhaps this early setback will sharpen up Joe Schmidt\u2019s squad, and pay off in the long run. The result appears a foregone conclusion - Russia are 150-1 to win - but for Ireland, everything else is still uncertain. Kick-off: 11.15am BST, 8.15pm in Kobe.",

      "body": "<p>Michael Coe, who has died aged 90, was an archaeologist and writer who made the ancient world come alive for scholars and public alike.

Until Mike\u2019s intervention, for instance, many had seen the Olmec civilisation of Veracruz and Tabasco in Mexico as being later than that of the Maya peoples. But Mike trounced that view.

Mike\u2019s book The Maya Scribe and His Word (1973) was possibly the most influential tome ever written on Maya art and its hieroglyphic texts. Delivered with eloquence and sparkle, it opened up a world of gods, dread spirits, dynastic scribes and courtly ladies, all legible in the hieroglyphs. Most of the books of this civilisation, the Classic Maya (AD250 to 850), had long rotted away, but Mike found them again \u2013 as enduring calligraphy on painted pottery.</p> <p>Until the emergence of The Maya Scribe and His Word it was also believed that just three books (known as the Maya codices) had survived from the Classic Maya era.

      "body": "<p>Compromises always involve discomfort. In a typical negotiation, both sides can arrive at a compromise on the understanding that, for each of them, the benefits of doing so outweigh the costs. It is the political and economic fragility of Northern Ireland that has made compromise between the UK and the EU, in the withdrawal agreement, necessary in the first place. Yet under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/oct/03/brexit-latest-news-boris-johnson-to-address-mps-as-gove-clams-new-plan-could-get-pretty-solid-majority-in-commons-live-news\" title=\"\">Boris Johnson\u2019s proposals for the Irish border</a>, the discomfort caused by the compromise would be borne almost exclusively by this small region. As they currently stand, his plans indicate a British government more willing to compromise Northern Ireland than it is to compromise over Brexit.</p> <p>What Johnson has offered the European commission is unexpected: instead of an invidious choice between a hard border on the Irish Sea or one across the island of Ireland, Northern Ireland shall have both. The rub is that Johnson is handing the responsibility for this decision now to the EU \u2013 as if the effects of such borders (either with a deal or no deal) will be primarily Ireland\u2019s problem and not one for the whole UK. His proposal persists with the illusion that Britain can have a cost-free Brexit, now enabled by putting the burden of managing the consequences on to the island of Ireland.</p> <p>This is clear from the two main dimensions of these proposals. First, regulatory alignment. Although Johnson claims that these proposals remove the so-called backstop, the most substantive part of it endures \u2013 and with bells on. Northern Ireland would effectively remain part of the EU\u2019s single market for \u201call goods\u201d. The critical difference between this and the backstop, however, is that it is not conditional. Northern Ireland shall be in a different regulatory zone to Britain regardless of the type of UK-EU relationship that is meant to be devised, miraculously quickly, by the end of the transition period.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/02/ireland-brexiteers-peace-border-britain\">Ireland stands united against Westminster\u2019s arrogant Brexiteers | Caelainn Hogan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Second, the greatest and most immediate difficulty comes in the ratcheting up of the status of the Irish border into a customs border. Theresa May promised \u201cno return to the borders of the past\u201d on the island of Ireland. One border of the past that many people here remember vividly was a customs border. They remember the paperwork, the inconvenience, the delays, the targeting of customs officers. What they remember less is how the economy was transformed when the benefits of being part of the EU\u2019s customs union could be married with the benefits of peace. It is all too easy for that to be reversed. The harder the Brexit, the more severe the impact of a customs border will be. What Johnson proposes will not protect Northern Ireland from these effects \u2013 it will, in fact, exacerbate them.</p> <p>The problem with the post-Brexit Irish border has always been managing the conundrum of avoiding making it a hard border (which would disrupt the conditions for peace, under the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/14/good-friday-agreement-ireland-brexit-tony-blair-bertie-ahern\" title=\"\">Good Friday agreement</a>) while running it efficiently. Any customs border worth its salt needs to be managed well. You have to assure prospective partners for trade deals that negotiations are worth their while, because you don\u2019t have leaky borders. You also need to assure local traders that their domestic market is protected against both smuggling and shoddy cheap imports, because the border is effective.

      "bodyText": "Compromises always involve discomfort. In a typical negotiation, both sides can arrive at a compromise on the understanding that, for each of them, the benefits of doing so outweigh the costs. It is the political and economic fragility of Northern Ireland that has made compromise between the UK and the EU, in the withdrawal agreement, necessary in the first place. Yet under Boris Johnson\u2019s proposals for the Irish border, the discomfort caused by the compromise would be borne almost exclusively by this small region. As they currently stand, his plans indicate a British government more willing to compromise Northern Ireland than it is to compromise over Brexit. What Johnson has offered the European commission is unexpected: instead of an invidious choice between a hard border on the Irish Sea or one across the island of Ireland, Northern Ireland shall have both. The rub is that Johnson is handing the responsibility for this decision now to the EU \u2013 as if the effects of such borders (either with a deal or no deal) will be primarily Ireland\u2019s problem and not one for the whole UK. His proposal persists with the illusion that Britain can have a cost-free Brexit, now enabled by putting the burden of managing the consequences on to the island of Ireland. This is clear from the two main dimensions of these proposals. First, regulatory alignment. Although Johnson claims that these proposals remove the so-called backstop, the most substantive part of it endures \u2013 and with bells on. Northern Ireland would effectively remain part of the EU\u2019s single market for \u201call goods\u201d. The critical difference between this and the backstop, however, is that it is not conditional. Northern Ireland shall be in a different regulatory zone to Britain regardless of the type of UK-EU relationship that is meant to be devised, miraculously quickly, by the end of the transition period. Second, the greatest and most immediate difficulty comes in the ratcheting up of the status of the Irish border into a customs border. Theresa May promised \u201cno return to the borders of the past\u201d on the island of Ireland. One border of the past that many people here remember vividly was a customs border. They remember the paperwork, the inconvenience, the delays, the targeting of customs officers. What they remember less is how the economy was transformed when the benefits of being part of the EU\u2019s customs union could be married with the benefits of peace. It is all too easy for that to be reversed. The harder the Brexit, the more severe the impact of a customs border will be. What Johnson proposes will not protect Northern Ireland from these effects \u2013 it will, in fact, exacerbate them. The problem with the post-Brexit Irish border has always been managing the conundrum of avoiding making it a hard border (which would disrupt the conditions for peace, under the Good Friday agreement) while running it efficiently. Any customs border worth its salt needs to be managed well. You have to assure prospective partners for trade deals that negotiations are worth their while, because you don\u2019t have leaky borders. You also need to assure local traders that their domestic market is protected against both smuggling and shoddy cheap imports, because the border is effective. If the Irish border is not run well \u2013 especially if the UK is determined on a hard Brexit \u2013 then smuggling not only becomes easier, it becomes more lucrative. The customs procedures outlined in the UK government\u2019s proposals are not extraordinary, but neither are they a convincing means of border management in this unique context. In fact, what Johnson is putting forward as mitigating measures are pretty familiar at this stage, having been broadly outlined as long ago as August 2017, in the UK government\u2019s white papers on customs and on Northern Ireland. They have worked elsewhere when they are used to help facilitate the movement of goods across a hard border. If there is no hard border, and no effective means of catching illegitimate operations, then the value and practicality of such measures dramatically decreases. \u201cAlternative arrangements\u201d to the backstop could in theory work for a customs border. But these would need to be carefully designed and developed over time, with input from those affected, and supported by proper resources. At this stage, therefore, the arrangements proposed can offer little more than legal uncertainty for the EU and worrying disruption for cross-border traders. In his letter to Jean-Claude Juncker, Johnson presents these proposals as, far from a final demand, \u201cthe basis for rapid negotiations towards a solution\u201d. Any proposal that would avoid costs to Britain while placing Northern Ireland\u2019s future as collateral cannot be allowed to be the last word on the matter. \u2022 Katy Hayward is reader in sociology at Queen\u2019s University Belfast and author of Bordering on Brexit",

One of the most persistent false arguments advanced by Trump administration officials against efforts to end US involvement in Yemen is that the Saudis need American support and training to prevent even more civilians deaths. But the latest UN report belies that argument, showing the Saudis have not done any credible investigations into their attacks on civilians or taken enough measures to minimize casualties, even with US and British training. In fact, the UN findings reinforce revelations from a recent UK case brought by anti-war campaigners. A UK court of appeal ruled that British arms sales to Saudi Arabia were illegal. Documents presented during the case showed that, despite the British government\u2019s claims, Saudi bombings of civilian targets took place within days after the UK provided training to the Saudi air force. Despite the mounting evidence of war crimes, Trump still firmly supports Mohammed bin Salman, the ruthless Saudi crown prince who is an architect of the Yemen war. Since April, Trump has used his veto power four times to prevent Congress from withdrawing US military support and ending weapons sales to Saudi Arabia and its allies. Congress could not muster enough votes to override Trump\u2019s vetoes. The latest UN investigation, which found the US is likely complicit in war crimes, should give new momentum to the majority in Congress that wants to end American involvement in a disastrous conflict.

      "bodyText": "Facebook will be subject to tougher controls over online content after the EU\u2019s highest court ruled the social media company can be ordered by member states to remove defamatory material worldwide. The judgment from the European court of justice in Luxembourg was condemned by free speech organisations for imposing restrictions on online comments. It effectively edges internet service providers further down the road towards becoming traditional publishers. The decision followed a complaint by the Austrian Green politician Eva Glawischnig-Piesczek to Facebook Ireland \u2013 the company\u2019s European headquarters \u2013 seeking the removal of comments posted by a user. The ECJ, judgments of which remain binding on the UK, said social media sites can be ordered to take down unlawful material. Host providers such as Facebook are currently not liable for stored information if they have no knowledge of its illegal nature or if they act \u201cexpeditiously\u201d to remove or disable access to that information as soon as they become aware of it. The latest ruling, however, states exemption does not prevent online platforms from being ordered by national authorities to remove illegal information or disable access to it. A statement on behalf of the ECJ also declared EU member states can order internet companies to block access to \u201cinformation [deemed unlawful] worldwide within the framework of the relevant international law, and it is up to member states to take that law into account\u201d. Free speech organisations warned the decision represented a threat to online content. The executive director of the charity Article 19, Thomas Hughes, said: \u201cThis judgment has major implications for online freedom of expression around the world. \u201cCompelling social media platforms like Facebook to automatically remove posts regardless of their context will infringe our right to free speech and restrict the information we see online. The judgment does not take into account the limitations of technology when it comes to automated filters. \u201cThe ruling also means that a court in one EU member state will be able to order the removal of social media posts in other countries, even if they are not considered unlawful there. This would set a dangerous precedent where the courts of one country can control what internet users in another country can see. This could be open to abuse, particularly by regimes with weak human rights records.\u201d The judgment enables a court in one EU member state to issue an order that could be used to remove posts by users around the world, even though what is considered unlawful in one country might not be considered unlawful in a different jurisdiction. The decision also raises questions about how material found to be unlawful in one country will be identified by Facebook or other social media sites without searching through the posts of all its users. Ted Shapiro, a solicitor at London media law firm Wiggin, said: \u201cThe court recognised that simply requiring a platform to take down a specific piece of defamatory content and content identical to that would be too easy to circumvent \u2026 It held that platforms can also be ordered to take down equivalent content, if specified in a court order. \u201cThis, the court said, does not constitute an excessive burden on the platform, particularly where it has recourse to automated search tools and technologies....

White drones had intermittently circled above their cornfields for the last few weeks, but there was no sign of them that morning.</p> \n<p>Raja and her mother, Amira, liked to take breaks under the acacia trees about 200 metres from the house. At 4pm, this was to become her final resting place.</p> \n<p>The plane was flying too high for them to hear it coming but Amira said the sound the CBU-52 B/B cluster bomb made as it rained 220 deadly submunitions on their heads will stay with her forever. Some exploded on impact while others, still armed, fell into the fields.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"58d9fade-396f-40c9-8620-8d0013f3fded\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eLYh-zmQq6w?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Screaming for her daughter, Amira saw Raja\u2019s twisted body under a small tree.

But the story of the bomb that is believed to have killed her stretches back decades earlier. Using the serial number and other technical information on the CBU-52 B/B\u2019s outer shell, the Guardian traced the munition from its manufacture in Milan, Tennessee, to Sahar farms, in north Yemen, where it ended a child\u2019s life.</p> \n<p>Cluster munitions were invented by the Nazis and had become a standard weapon of war across the world by the 1970s, designed to kill as many people as possible.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cdfde81c80c3b14ec08248c5b80d575243605e1c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cdfde81c80c3b14ec08248c5b80d575243605e1c/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hamoud Mohammed al-Ghar.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hamoud Mohammed al-Ghar on 14 September 2019, near the spot where he found the body of Raja Hamid Yahya al-Oud.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Achilleas Zavallis for The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>They usually consist of a hollow shell filled with hundreds of submunitions that disperse over an area as big as several football pitches as it falls through the air.

      "bodyText": "The last day of 14-year-old Raja Hamid Yahya al-Oud\u2019s life began like any other. She got up early along with the rest of the family because there was always a lot of work to do on the farm in the spring planting season. White drones had intermittently circled above their cornfields for the last few weeks, but there was no sign of them that morning. Raja and her mother, Amira, liked to take breaks under the acacia trees about 200 metres from the house. At 4pm, this was to become her final resting place. The plane was flying too high for them to hear it coming but Amira said the sound the CBU-52 B/B cluster bomb made as it rained 220 deadly submunitions on their heads will stay with her forever. Some exploded on impact while others, still armed, fell into the fields. Screaming for her daughter, Amira saw Raja\u2019s twisted body under a small tree. Her jaw and entire right side had been ripped apart and blood had already dyed the sand around her black. A neighbour, Hamoud Mohammed al-Ghar, dodged the remaining submunitions to pick Raja up and then ran with her to the nearest road to find a car to take her to hospital. \u201cI knew the girl was already dead,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I had to try.\u201d The drones circled ahead the entire time. Raja died on 23 March 2018. But the story of the bomb that is believed to have killed her stretches back decades earlier. Using the serial number and other technical information on the CBU-52 B/B\u2019s outer shell, the Guardian traced the munition from its manufacture in Milan, Tennessee, to Sahar farms, in north Yemen, where it ended a child\u2019s life. Cluster munitions were invented by the Nazis and had become a standard weapon of war across the world by the 1970s, designed to kill as many people as possible. They usually consist of a hollow shell filled with hundreds of submunitions that disperse over an area as big as several football pitches as it falls through the air. They either explode on impact or are triggered when moved or stepped on, firing hundreds of fragments of metal that travel at the speed of bullets. The submunitions remain a threat for decades once deployed and those from older designs often resemble shiny silver orbs around the size of a tennis ball, making unexploded ordnance especially attractive to curious children. Hundreds of people worldwide die each year after coming into contact with unexploded cluster bombs, with about 300 casualties a year in Vietnam alone. In 2008 an international treaty called the convention on cluster munitions severely limiting the use, transfer and stockpiling of cluster bombs was adopted by 30 countries. By 2018 it had been signed by 120 states. The US, which sells arms to Saudi-led forces fighting in Yemen, was not one of them. \u201cCluster munitions went through a proportionality test to measure military advantages gained versus civilian harm of their use,\u201d said Rawan Shaif, the lead Yemen researcher at the open source investigative organisation Bellingcat, of the Geneva conventions relating to the protection of victims of armed conflict. \u201cThere\u2019s no military advantage in using a cluster munition in a farm, unless your aim is to make that area uninhabitable for generations of civilians and military alike.\u201d The cluster bomb that killed Raja was manufactured at the Milan Army Ammunition Plant in 1977. The large site, just north of Jackson in west Tennessee, encompasses 231 miles (372km) of roads and 88 miles (142km) of railways and is nicknamed Bullet Town by residents.

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s ambassador in Washington has flatly rejected a description by the Senate judiciary committee chairman, Lindsey Graham, of Alexander Downer\u2019s role in relaying information to US authorities about Russia obtaining damaging information about Hillary Clinton. Graham, an influential Republican senator, wrote to the prime ministers of Australia, Italy and the UK calling for their continued cooperation with the US attorney general William Barr\u2019s investigation \u2013 a controversial probe established by Donald Trump aimed at discrediting the Mueller inquiry. In his letter Graham referred to US law enforcement and intelligence communities \u201caccepting information from an Australian diplomat who was also directed to contact [George] Papadopoulos and relay information obtained from Papadopoulos regarding the campaign to the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u201d. The Mueller investigation began after Australia\u2019s former foreign affairs minister, Downer, was allegedly told about the interference by Papadopoulos, a Trump campaign aide. Downer then informed US authorities. According to Downer, Papadopoulos had told him during \u201ca night of heavy drinking\u201d in May 2016 that Russia had obtained damaging information about Clinton from her emails. Trump, who is under increasing domestic pressure as prominent Democrats step up calls for his impeachment, has set up the politically charged Barr inquiry as an investigation into the investigators. Australia\u2019s ambassador, Joe Hockey, told Graham in a response posted on social media on Thursday night that Australia was cooperating with the Barr investigation, and he said Scott Morrison\u2019s government had given a public commitment to assist the inquiry. But he took issue with Graham\u2019s description of Downer\u2019s activities. \u201cWe reject your characterisation of his role,\u201d the ambassador said. \u201cAs you have requested, we will work closely with the attorney-general to resolve any misunderstandings in this matter.\u201d Morrison has been on the defensive about Australia\u2019s participation in the Barr inquiry \u2013 a highly partisan exercise \u2013 since the New York Times revealed this week that Trump had called the Australian prime minister asking for cooperation in the lead-up to Morrison\u2019s trip to the US last week. After the Times revealed the call had taken place, Morrison\u2019s office confirmed it had occurred. \u201cThe Australian government has always been ready to assist and cooperate with efforts that help shed further light on the matters under investigation,\u201d it said. \u201cThe PM confirmed this readiness once again in conversation with the president.\u201d The dialogue between the Trump administration and the Morrison government over participation in the probe has apparently been playing out for some months. On 25 May Trump blasted Australia before leaving on a trip to Japan, declaring he wanted Australia\u2019s role in setting off the FBI inquiry into links between Russia and his election campaign examined by Barr. Trump said he hoped Barr would \u201clook at the UK and I hope he looks at Australia and I hope he looks at Ukraine.

      "body": "<h2><strong>35. Without Evidence (1996)</strong></h2> \n<p>Semi-coherent thriller about a real-life murder from Jolie\u2019s scrapping-for-any-bit-of-work period. She is hardly in it, but the post-fame DVD sleeve makes her look like the lead character.</p> \n<h2><strong>34. Lookin\u2019 to Get Out (1982)</strong></h2> \n<p>Jolie\u2019s celebrated first screen appearance, alongside her dad, Jon Voight, in the Hal Ashby directed Vegas comedy. Jolie is a very sweet seven-year-old, but this is mainly of historical interest.</p> \n<h2><strong>33. Love Is All There Is (1996)</strong></h2> \n<p>Klutzy comedy about rival Italian-American catering dynasties, whose two kids fall in love, Romeo-and-Juliet style. Jolie\u2019s charisma is evident, but the casts\u2019 accents would get them arrested today.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ba3f0009f4af8ca8d326b55423120ef68c425898\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba3f0009f4af8ca8d326b55423120ef68c425898/0_0_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Elias Koteas in Cyborg 2.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Elias Koteas in Cyborg 2.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Sportsphoto Ltd.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>32. Cyborg 2 (1993)</strong></h2> \n<p>Jolie\u2019s first big role, as a cyborg who falls in love with her trainer (\u201cthe perfect killing machine \u2026 peak condition, top of the line\u201d), in a sequel to the cruddy Jean-Claude Van Damme straight-to-tape. Jolie shows action chops, but line readings are not yet her forte. She reportedly hated it, anyway.</p> \n<h2><strong>31. Mojave Moon (1996)</strong></h2> \n<p>Jolie\u2019s first go at the kind of nutso-sexy role that would become a staple for the first part of her career. Danny Aiello plays the sap who gets into trouble after giving her a ride back to her mother\u2019s place.</p> \n<h2><strong>30. Playing God (1997)</strong></h2> \n<p>Jolie plays the mystery woman again in this indie thriller about an ex-doctor (David Duchovny) forced to work for gangsters. More hanging out of speeding cars, already by then a Jolie trope.</p> \n<h2><strong>29. Hell\u2019s Kitchen (1998)</strong></h2> \n<p>Jolie still marking time and learning her trade in another indie thriller \u2013 she plays a woman out to kill an ex-con (Mekhi Phifer) whom she holds responsible for the death of her brother. Not great, but not awful.</p> \n<h2><strong>28. Life Or Something Like It (2002)</strong></h2> \n<p>Jolie tried her hand at a standard-issue romcom \u2013 she plays a TV reporter with a week to live, who gets feelings for Ed Burns. Safe to say, sparks did not fly.</p> \n<h2><strong>27. Original Sin (2001)</strong></h2> \n<p>One of those films you just have to put down to the old learning curve. Jolie plays a mysterious postal bride in 19th-century Cuba who turns Antonio Banderas inside out.</p> \n<h2><strong>26. Playing By Heart (1998)</strong></h2> \n<p>Jolie dipped her toe in the big league with this Miramax-distributed multi-stranded ensemble romcom, with names including Gillian Anderson, Sean Connery and Jon Stewart dotting the cast list. Jolie cuts quite a dash in cropped hair and gold lam\u00e9 trousers.</p> \n<h2><strong>25. Lara Croft: Tomb Raider \u2013 The Cradle of Life (2003)</strong></h2> \n<p>As night follows day, Tomb Raider\u2019s $270m box office brought forth this sequel, in which Lara is after an orb that can open Pandora\u2019s box. Interesting fact: the BBC had a piece of both Tomb Raider films, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b007ck00/lara-croft-tomb-raider-the-cradle-of-life\" title=\"\">which is why they are virtual fixtures on </a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b007ck00/lara-croft-tomb-raider-the-cradle-of-life\" title=\"\">iPlayer</a>.</p> \n<h2><strong>24. Beyond Borders (2003)</strong></h2> \n<p>Jolie\u2019s activist impulses were engaged after an eye-opening location shoot in Cambodia for Tomb Raider, and in 2001 she was appointed a UNHCR goodwill ambassador. This self-righteous thriller, in which she plays a clueless art-world type entranced by the hunky aid worker Clive Owen, was no doubt an attempt to channel her own conversion. But, presumably, Jolie was rattled by the flak it got, after it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/nov/15/usa.film\" title=\"\">accused of endangering real-world aid workers</a> with a gun-smuggling plotline.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"447bd93add4583181e8dab0361f8da337b44e6d0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/447bd93add4583181e8dab0361f8da337b44e6d0/0_121_2096_1257/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In Taking Lives.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In Taking Lives.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex Features</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>23. Taking Lives (2004)</strong></h2> \n<p>Jolie plays the world\u2019s most impeccably styled criminal profiler in a convoluted, but underwhelming, serial-killer movie: Ethan Hawke is the nasty, whose victims provide a new identity for him after every kill.</p> \n<h2><strong>22. Foxfire (1996)</strong></h2> \n<p>One of Jolie\u2019s more interesting early films, an adaptation of Joyce Carol Oates\u2019 girl-gang novel. In boots and pixie cut, Jolie really looks the part: she plays another nutso-sexy character \u2013 Legs, a drifter who encourages a group of put-upon schoolkids to rebel. Rawer, perhaps, than the recent remake by <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1772270/\" title=\"\">Laurent Cantet</a>, but an early signpost of Jolie\u2019s potential, and a virtual rehearsal for Girl, Interrupted.</p> \n<h2><strong>21. Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (2004)</strong></h2> \n<p>Jolie didn\u2019t have a huge amount to do in this amazing-looking steampunk sci-fi thriller, apart from looking purposeful in a military cap and eye patch. She is the commander of an aircraft carrier, helping fighter pilot Jude Law foil evil scientist Dr Totenkopf.</p> \n<h2><strong>20. Shark Tale (2004)</strong></h2> \n<p>DreamWorks\u2019 attempt at a fishy animation was somewhat eclipsed by Pixar\u2019s Finding Nemo, but had a spectacular cast: Will Smith, Robert De Niro and (of all people) Martin Scorsese as a mafioso shark. Jolie had the usual slinky/sexy role as an impressively maned fish called Lola, who drapes herself around our hero before being dumped for Ren\u00e9e Zellweger.</p> \n<h2><strong>19. Wanted (2008)</strong></h2> \n<p>Never one to neglect the action fanbase, Jolie kept her hand in with the mentor role in this bonkers Matrix-meets-Kingsman thriller starring James McAvoy. Codenamed Fox (duh), she teaches McAvoy how to shoot round corners and become a fully paid-up assassin for a weird cult.</p> \n<h2><strong>18. Hackers (1995)</strong></h2> \n<p>Jolie really marked her card with this time-capsule (but inevitably dated-looking) cyber-thriller, starring a panoply of best-forgotten mid-90s haircuts and primitive computer graphics. Alongside her future first husband Jonny Lee Miller, Jolie made what was the first of a series of attention-grabbing, film-stealing performances.</p> \n<h2><strong>17. The Good Shepherd (2006)</strong></h2> \n<p>A lengthy, solemn film about the early days of the CIA in the 1960s, directed by Robert De Niro and featuring lots of men in hats and raincoats. Jolie glows in characteristic style as the unhappy wife of dour agent Matt Damon; her opportunities for spying are strictly limited, and her role is there to show the domestic price men such as Damon\u2019s character pay.</p> \n<h2><strong>16. Kung Fu Panda (2007)</strong></h2> \n<p>Another mentor role for Jolie as one of the \u201cfurious five\u201d ninja-warrior animals who train up Jack Black\u2019s useless giant panda. The film is a lot of fun, but despite getting third billing \u2013 behind Black and Dustin Hoffman \u2013 Jolie\u2019s tiger role is a bit on the thin side. Two sequels continued the pattern, although her roles are so small, they don\u2019t really warrant separate entries here.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"540d0eb972b905534a2b2fa2454c53192c3849f7\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/540d0eb972b905534a2b2fa2454c53192c3849f7/0_28_1500_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tomb Raider.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tomb Raider.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>15. Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001)</strong></h2> \n<p>In 2001 what the world wanted to see was Jolie racing around in her skimpies while handling enormous weapons \u2013 and they paid to see it, big time. As unwatchable as every video game movie yet produced, Tomb Raider at least had the novelty of Jolie trying out a ludicrous posh-English accent and \u2013 all joking aside \u2013 showed that Jolie could carry a movie single-handedly, however idiotic it was. It was the one that put her over the top.</p> \n<h2><strong>14. The Tourist (2010)</strong></h2> \n<p>Presumably hoping for a bit of the old Brad Pitt-style on-screen chemistry, Jolie paired up with Johnny Depp for another go at the smouldering mismatch action-comedy thriller. Depp, not especially funny, is the hapless tourist scooped up by Jolie\u2019s femme fatale as cover; Jolie, styled to the max, seems to mostly coast through things. Nobody\u2019s finest moment.</p> \n<h2><strong>13. The Bone Collector (1999)</strong></h2> \n<p>On the brink of stardom, Jolie appeared in this adaptation of Jeffery Deaver\u2019s doorstop serial-killer thriller featuring a quadriplegic forensic analyst, Lincoln Rhyme, played by Denzel Washington. She is the fresh-faced rookie cop who follows Rhyme\u2019s orders as they track down a vicious taxi-driving murderer, and pretty much nails it. This was a crucial step in proving she could handle a solid Hollywood moneymaker.</p> \n<h2><strong>12. Beowulf (2007)</strong></h2> \n<p>Jolie\u2019s second sexy-mythological mum role, in Robert Zemeckis\u2019s adaptation of the epic poem. Zemeckis\u2019s decision to go with motion-capture and CGI means this lives very much in the uncanny valley, but it allows him to get away with what the male teen fanbase was slavering for: a full-body nude shot of Jolie as she emerges from a lake of fire, albeit refracted through a glassy, liquid-metal texture.</p> \n<h2><strong>11. Gia (1998)</strong></h2> \n<p>Jolie couldn\u2019t have found a better role than that of Gia Carangi, the meteorically successful, but self-destructive, model who died in 1986. Jolie fitted the wild-child persona perfectly: this HBO film got her a Golden Globe and a ticket to the Hollywood elite.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d1df3542d4779411d891b2227be72be14bdef0fb\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1df3542d4779411d891b2227be72be14bdef0fb/0_0_2165_1298/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Colin Farrell in Alexander.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Colin Farrell in Alexander.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>10. Alexander (2004)</strong></h2> \n<p>Jolie was, notoriously, only a year older than Colin Farrell when she was cast as his mother in the Oliver Stone classical-era epic, which turned out to be a riotous fusion of semi-history and sword-and-sandal fantasy. Encumbered with yet another odd accent, Jolie nevertheless turned up the dial to 11 with a tigerish performance of roaring, vengeful fury, mashed together with gruesome mother-son lasciviousness.</p> \n<h2><strong>9. Gone in 60 Seconds (2000)</strong></h2> \n<p>This was Jolie\u2019s first big action hit, in what in retrospect was a frighteningly influential blockbuster (where would the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/14/why-fast-furious-is-the-best-film-franchise-of-all-time\" title=\"\">Fast and the Furious</a> films be without it?) As the dreadlocked Sway, Jolie proved proficient as the supercool badass and the hot-to-trot arm candy. Hollywood was not quite ready to trust her with a film of her own, but it was only a matter of time.</p> \n<h2><strong>8. By the Sea (2015)</strong></h2> \n<p>Jolie\u2019s move into directing was designed to complement her activist work, with films about the Bosnian war, a second world war PoW and the Khmer Rouge. By the Sea, however, was very different: a highly personal relationship drama, consciously modelled on European new-wave cinema of Deray or Antonioni. Very much a vanity project, it was widely derided as a second <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/oct/09/news.madonna\" title=\"\">Swept Away</a>, but that is not really fair: it was never going to get the big bucks. Jolie said it was inspired by her mother, but Pitt\u2019s presence as the other half of a troubled marriage gave this a through-the-keyhole air. Their own relationship disintegrated a year after its release.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"04973e6680f61dd438081d83c4e42602294803e3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04973e6680f61dd438081d83c4e42602294803e3/0_0_1768_1061/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Winona Ryder in Girl, Interrupted.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Winona Ryder in Girl, Interrupted.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Columbia Pictures/Everett</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>7. Girl, Interrupted (1999)</strong></h2> \n<p>Jolie distilled all her self-destructive/manipulative/sexy roles into this career gamechanger: she blew away the film\u2019s ostensible lead, Winona Ryder, and bagged an Oscar into the bargain. In retrospect, with the ostentatious tonal palette of khaki and beige, this does look like a pretty odd depiction of a psychiatric hospital, even though it is based on a memoir: it resembles a Gap ad shot at the Institute for Extreme Hotness. The supporting cast were all major figures in waiting, too: Elisabeth Moss, Brittany Murphy, Clea DuVall.</p> \n<h2><strong>6. Pushing Tin (1999)</strong></h2> \n<p>One of those amazing films that even if you have no idea what is actually happening \u2013 it\u2019s a thriller about air-traffic control \u2013 still manage to be incredibly exciting. By this time, Jolie\u2019s extracurricular activities had become stories in themselves, and her relationship with co-star Billy Bob Thornton (soon to become husband No 2) was a subject of tabloid notoriety, not the least those <a href=\"https://www.eonline.com/de/news/590687/billy-bob-thornton-explains-why-angelina-jolie-wanted-to-wear-a-vial-of-his-blood-around-her-neck\" title=\"\">vials of blood</a> they were rumoured to have exchanged. Jolie\u2019s role is another of her manipulative, free-spirit numbers, but taken somewhat to extremes: weepy/needy one minute, overpoweringly seductive the next. But the film itself is so great, it just seems to work.</p> \n<h2><strong>5. A Mighty Heart (2007)</strong></h2> \n<p>Even though she was given the nod by the film\u2019s real-life subject, Mariane Pearl, Jolie took quite a bit of flak for playing the role of the Cuban-Dutch journalist whose husband, Daniel, was murdered in 2002 by a terror group in Pakistan. Darkening her skin tone was controversial enough in 2007; these days it would be considered close to blackface. However, in conjunction with the British docudrama specialist Michael Winterbottom, Jolie spearheaded a powerful, politically inflected drama, a more convincing use of her activist inclinations than the likes of Beyond Borders. Jolie also exercised acting muscles that she had rarely employed in the previous decade.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fc41dadfcb359e06f7edf05ada1a8e0ead109dd7\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc41dadfcb359e06f7edf05ada1a8e0ead109dd7/0_0_4164_2498/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In Changeling.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In Changeling.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Sportsphoto</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>4. Changeling (2008)</strong></h2> \n<p>Perhaps given a shot in the arm by A Mighty Heart, Jolie went full throttle for an Oscar in Clint Eastwood\u2019s classy, grandiose true crime drama, based on the infamous <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wineville_Chicken_Coop_murders\" title=\"\">Wineville chicken coop murders</a> in the 1920s. Jolie plays Christine Collins, a woman whose son, Walter, was among the victims, but who was pressured into identifying another boy as her missing son. Jolie goes through the whole gamut of actorly emotions, from bafflement to rage to breakdown; she gives it her considerable all, but it didn\u2019t quite get her over the line, beaten to the statuette by Kate Winslet for The Reader.</p> \n<h2><strong>3. Salt (2010)</strong></h2> \n<p>This was an early example of muscle-flexing Hollywood gender-swap: originally a Tom Cruise vehicle, this was reworked after Jolie got involved, switching the sex of the lead character, but leaving in all the head-cracking derring-do that goes with the Mission-Impossible-y turf. Jolie pulls it off spectacularly: her proficiency in the action movie verities beyond reproach, while injecting enough emotion into the moodier passages to give the character some bite. Not sure why this hasn\u2019t become a franchise; the boring title probably didn\u2019t help.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e57c4715885f95a6b40b65bb98da83a0c3e6da1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e57c4715885f95a6b40b65bb98da83a0c3e6da1/0_70_2704_1622/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Salt.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Salt.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Columbia Pictures/Allstar</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>2. Maleficent (2014)</strong></h2> \n<p>Disney cleverly exploited Jolie\u2019s otherworldly qualities \u2013 ethereally satanic probably best describes them \u2013 in this revisionist fairytale, in which Jolie plays the wicked witch from Sleeping Beauty with a considerably more sympathetic backstory. The image of her with curling black horns and digitally enhanced cheekbones is one that will go with her for ever \u2013 the word \u201ciconic\u201d is overused, but this one merits it. The film itself isn\u2019t quite kidult \u2013 more kiddy than adulty \u2013 but it\u2019s still a feast for the eyes, and Jolie evinces real pain as the fairy who loses her wings.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ0B22z22pI\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CZ0B22z22pI?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Mr &amp; Mrs Smith.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>1. Mr &amp; Mrs Smith (2005)</strong></h2> \n<p>I prefer Jolie in her hard-as-nails incarnation rather than, say, her dewy-eyed do-gooder or manipulative bad-girl modes; and spy films tend to bring out her sense of humour as well as reining in her frequent habit of going over the top. Here she gets to do a bit of everything that makes her a great performer: terrific action scenes, screwball-level marital comedy, some really rather impressive emoting. It also helped, of course, that there was a real-life backstory to the relationship between her and her co-star, Brad Pitt: this, of course, was the film set where \u201cBrangelina\u201d was born. Oddly enough, this film stands as a comic companion piece to By the Sea: it\u2019s also about a jaded marriage flailing around for reinvigoration. It says something, though, that while Mr &amp; Mrs Smith is a lot of fun, no one could mistake it for a masterpiece: Jolie, without doubt a stone-cold superstar, tends to be better and/or bigger than the films she has been in. But she has plenty of time to put that right.</p> \n<p><em>Maleficent: Mistress of Evil is released in the UK and US on 18 October</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"166615a1-ed30-43e9-9201-083a41ce7713\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Actors</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/07/actors-playing-nightmarish-versions-of-themselves-in-cinema-ranked-keeanu-reeves\">Actors playing nightmarish versions of themselves in cinema -

      "bodyText": "35. Without Evidence (1996) Semi-coherent thriller about a real-life murder from Jolie\u2019s scrapping-for-any-bit-of-work period. She is hardly in it, but the post-fame DVD sleeve makes her look like the lead character. 34. Lookin\u2019 to Get Out (1982) Jolie\u2019s celebrated first screen appearance, alongside her dad, Jon Voight, in the Hal Ashby directed Vegas comedy. Jolie is a very sweet seven-year-old, but this is mainly of historical interest. 33. Love Is All There Is (1996) Klutzy comedy about rival Italian-American catering dynasties, whose two kids fall in love, Romeo-and-Juliet style. Jolie\u2019s charisma is evident, but the casts\u2019 accents would get them arrested today. 32. Cyborg 2 (1993) Jolie\u2019s first big role, as a cyborg who falls in love with her trainer (\u201cthe perfect killing machine \u2026 peak condition, top of the line\u201d), in a sequel to the cruddy Jean-Claude Van Damme straight-to-tape. Jolie shows action chops, but line readings are not yet her forte. She reportedly hated it, anyway. 31. Mojave Moon (1996) Jolie\u2019s first go at the kind of nutso-sexy role that would become a staple for the first part of her career. Danny Aiello plays the sap who gets into trouble after giving her a ride back to her mother\u2019s place. 30. Playing God (1997) Jolie plays the mystery woman again in this indie thriller about an ex-doctor (David Duchovny) forced to work for gangsters. More hanging out of speeding cars, already by then a Jolie trope. 29. Hell\u2019s Kitchen (1998) Jolie still marking time and learning her trade in another indie thriller \u2013 she plays a woman out to kill an ex-con (Mekhi Phifer) whom she holds responsible for the death of her brother. Not great, but not awful. 28. Life Or Something Like It (2002) Jolie tried her hand at a standard-issue romcom \u2013 she plays a TV reporter with a week to live, who gets feelings for Ed Burns. Safe to say, sparks did not fly. 27. Original Sin (2001) One of those films you just have to put down to the old learning curve. Jolie plays a mysterious postal bride in 19th-century Cuba who turns Antonio Banderas inside out. 26. Playing By Heart (1998) Jolie dipped her toe in the big league with this Miramax-distributed multi-stranded ensemble romcom, with names including Gillian Anderson, Sean Connery and Jon Stewart dotting the cast list. Jolie cuts quite a dash in cropped hair and gold lam\u00e9 trousers. 25. Lara Croft: Tomb Raider \u2013 The Cradle of Life (2003) As night follows day, Tomb Raider\u2019s $270m box office brought forth this sequel, in which Lara is after an orb that can open Pandora\u2019s box. Interesting fact: the BBC had a piece of both Tomb Raider films, which is why they are virtual fixtures on iPlayer. 24. Beyond Borders (2003) Jolie\u2019s activist impulses were engaged after an eye-opening location shoot in Cambodia for Tomb Raider, and in 2001 she was appointed a UNHCR goodwill ambassador. This self-righteous thriller, in which she plays a clueless art-world type entranced by the hunky aid worker Clive Owen, was no doubt an attempt to channel her own conversion. But, presumably, Jolie was rattled by the flak it got, after it was accused of endangering real-world aid workers with a gun-smuggling plotline. 23. Taking Lives (2004) Jolie plays the world\u2019s most impeccably styled criminal profiler in a convoluted, but underwhelming, serial-killer movie: Ethan Hawke is the nasty, whose victims provide a new identity for him after every kill. 22. Foxfire (1996) One of Jolie\u2019s more interesting early films, an adaptation of Joyce Carol Oates\u2019 girl-gang novel. In boots and pixie cut, Jolie really looks the part: she plays another nutso-sexy character \u2013 Legs, a drifter who encourages a group of put-upon schoolkids to rebel. Rawer, perhaps, than the recent remake by Laurent Cantet, but an early signpost of Jolie\u2019s potential, and a virtual rehearsal for Girl, Interrupted. 21. Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (2004) Jolie didn\u2019t have a huge amount to do in this amazing-looking steampunk sci-fi thriller, apart from looking purposeful in a military cap and eye patch. She is the commander of an aircraft carrier, helping fighter pilot Jude Law foil evil scientist Dr Totenkopf. 20. Shark Tale (2004) DreamWorks\u2019 attempt at a fishy animation was somewhat eclipsed by Pixar\u2019s Finding Nemo, but had a spectacular cast: Will Smith, Robert De Niro and (of all people) Martin Scorsese as a mafioso shark. Jolie had the usual slinky/sexy role as an impressively maned fish called Lola, who drapes herself around our hero before being dumped for Ren\u00e9e Zellweger. 19. Wanted (2008) Never one to neglect the action fanbase, Jolie kept her hand in with the mentor role in this bonkers Matrix-meets-Kingsman thriller starring James McAvoy. Codenamed Fox (duh), she teaches McAvoy how to shoot round corners and become a fully paid-up assassin for a weird cult. 18. Hackers (1995) Jolie really marked her card with this time-capsule (but inevitably dated-looking) cyber-thriller, starring a panoply of best-forgotten mid-90s haircuts and primitive computer graphics. Alongside her future first husband Jonny Lee Miller, Jolie made what was the first of a series of attention-grabbing, film-stealing performances. 17. The Good Shepherd (2006) A lengthy, solemn film about the early days of the CIA in the 1960s, directed by Robert De Niro and featuring lots of men in hats and raincoats. Jolie glows in characteristic style as the unhappy wife of dour agent Matt Damon; her opportunities for spying are strictly limited, and her role is there to show the domestic price men such as Damon\u2019s character pay. 16. Kung Fu Panda (2007) Another mentor role for Jolie as one of the \u201cfurious five\u201d ninja-warrior animals who train up Jack Black\u2019s useless giant panda. The film is a lot of fun, but despite getting third billing \u2013 behind Black and Dustin Hoffman \u2013 Jolie\u2019s tiger role is a bit on the thin side. Two sequels continued the pattern, although her roles are so small, they don\u2019t really warrant separate entries here. 15. Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) In 2001 what the world wanted to see was Jolie racing around in her skimpies while handling enormous weapons \u2013 and they paid to see it, big time. As unwatchable as every video game movie yet produced, Tomb Raider at least had the novelty of Jolie trying out a ludicrous posh-English accent and \u2013 all joking aside \u2013 showed that Jolie could carry a movie single-handedly, however idiotic it was. It was the one that put her over the top. 14. The Tourist (2010) Presumably hoping for a bit of the old Brad Pitt-style on-screen chemistry, Jolie paired up with Johnny Depp for another go at the smouldering mismatch action-comedy thriller. Depp, not especially funny, is the hapless tourist scooped up by Jolie\u2019s femme fatale as cover; Jolie, styled to the max, seems to mostly coast through things. Nobody\u2019s finest moment. 13. The Bone Collector (1999) On the brink of stardom, Jolie appeared in this adaptation of Jeffery Deaver\u2019s doorstop serial-killer thriller featuring a quadriplegic forensic analyst, Lincoln Rhyme, played by Denzel Washington. She is the fresh-faced rookie cop who follows Rhyme\u2019s orders as they track down a vicious taxi-driving murderer, and pretty much nails it. This was a crucial step in proving she could handle a solid Hollywood moneymaker. 12. Beowulf (2007) Jolie\u2019s second sexy-mythological mum role, in Robert Zemeckis\u2019s adaptation of the epic poem. Zemeckis\u2019s decision to go with motion-capture and CGI means this lives very much in the uncanny valley, but it allows him to get away with what the male teen fanbase was slavering for: a full-body nude shot of Jolie as she emerges from a lake of fire, albeit refracted through a glassy, liquid-metal texture. 11. Gia (1998) Jolie couldn\u2019t have found a better role than that of Gia Carangi, the meteorically successful, but self-destructive, model who died in 1986. Jolie fitted the wild-child persona perfectly: this HBO film got her a Golden Globe and a ticket to the Hollywood elite. 10. Alexander (2004) Jolie was, notoriously, only a year older than Colin Farrell when she was cast as his mother in the Oliver Stone classical-era epic, which turned out to be a riotous fusion of semi-history and sword-and-sandal fantasy. Encumbered with yet another odd accent, Jolie nevertheless turned up the dial to 11 with a tigerish performance of roaring, vengeful fury, mashed together with gruesome mother-son lasciviousness. 9. Gone in 60 Seconds (2000) This was Jolie\u2019s first big action hit, in what in retrospect was a frighteningly influential blockbuster (where would the Fast and the Furious films be without it?) As the dreadlocked Sway, Jolie proved proficient as the supercool badass and the hot-to-trot arm candy. Hollywood was not quite ready to trust her with a film of her own, but it was only a matter of time. 8. By the Sea (2015) Jolie\u2019s move into directing was designed to complement her activist work, with films about the Bosnian war, a second world war PoW and the Khmer Rouge. By the Sea, however, was very different: a highly personal relationship drama, consciously modelled on European new-wave cinema of Deray or Antonioni. Very much a vanity project, it was widely derided as a second Swept Away, but that is not really fair: it was never going to get the big bucks. Jolie said it was inspired by her mother, but Pitt\u2019s presence as the other half of a troubled marriage gave this a through-the-keyhole air. Their own relationship disintegrated a year after its release. 7. Girl, Interrupted (1999) Jolie distilled all her self-destructive/manipulative/sexy roles into this career gamechanger: she blew away the film\u2019s ostensible lead, Winona Ryder, and bagged an Oscar into the bargain. In retrospect, with the ostentatious tonal palette of khaki and beige, this does look like a pretty odd depiction of a psychiatric hospital, even though it is based on a memoir: it resembles a Gap ad shot at the Institute for Extreme Hotness. The supporting cast were all major figures in waiting, too: Elisabeth Moss, Brittany Murphy, Clea DuVall. 6. Pushing Tin (1999) One of those amazing films that even if you have no idea what is actually happening \u2013 it\u2019s a thriller about air-traffic control \u2013 still manage to be incredibly exciting. By this time, Jolie\u2019s extracurricular activities had become stories in themselves, and her relationship with co-star Billy Bob Thornton (soon to become husband No 2) was a subject of tabloid notoriety, not the least those vials of blood they were rumoured to have exchanged. Jolie\u2019s role is another of her manipulative, free-spirit numbers, but taken somewhat to extremes: weepy/needy one minute, overpoweringly seductive the next. But the film itself is so great, it just seems to work. 5. A Mighty Heart (2007) Even though she was given the nod by the film\u2019s real-life subject, Mariane Pearl, Jolie took quite a bit of flak for playing the role of the Cuban-Dutch journalist whose husband, Daniel, was murdered in 2002 by a terror group in Pakistan. Darkening her skin tone was controversial enough in 2007; these days it would be considered close to blackface. However, in conjunction with the British docudrama specialist Michael Winterbottom, Jolie spearheaded a powerful, politically inflected drama, a more convincing use of her activist inclinations than the likes of Beyond Borders. Jolie also exercised acting muscles that she had rarely employed in the previous decade. 4. Changeling (2008) Perhaps given a shot in the arm by A Mighty Heart, Jolie went full throttle for an Oscar in Clint Eastwood\u2019s classy, grandiose true crime drama, based on the infamous Wineville chicken coop murders in the 1920s. Jolie plays Christine Collins, a woman whose son, Walter, was among the victims, but who was pressured into identifying another boy as her missing son. Jolie goes through the whole gamut of actorly emotions, from bafflement to rage to breakdown; she gives it her considerable all, but it didn\u2019t quite get her over the line, beaten to the statuette by Kate Winslet for The Reader. 3. Salt (2010) This was an early example of muscle-flexing Hollywood gender-swap: originally a Tom Cruise vehicle, this was reworked after Jolie got involved, switching the sex of the lead character, but leaving in all the head-cracking derring-do that goes with the Mission-Impossible-y turf. Jolie pulls it off spectacularly: her proficiency in the action movie verities beyond reproach, while injecting enough emotion into the moodier passages to give the character some bite. Not sure why this hasn\u2019t become a franchise; the boring title probably didn\u2019t help. 2. Maleficent (2014) Disney cleverly exploited Jolie\u2019s otherworldly qualities \u2013 ethereally satanic probably best describes them \u2013 in this revisionist fairytale, in which Jolie plays the wicked witch from Sleeping Beauty with a considerably more sympathetic backstory. The image of her with curling black horns and digitally enhanced cheekbones is one that will go with her for ever \u2013 the word \u201ciconic\u201d is overused, but this one merits it. The film itself isn\u2019t quite kidult \u2013 more kiddy than adulty \u2013 but it\u2019s still a feast for the eyes, and Jolie evinces real pain as the fairy who loses her wings. 1. Mr &amp; Mrs Smith (2005) I prefer Jolie in her hard-as-nails incarnation rather than, say, her dewy-eyed do-gooder or manipulative bad-girl modes; and spy films tend to bring out her sense of humour as well as reining in her frequent habit of going over the top. Here she gets to do a bit of everything that makes her a great performer: terrific action scenes, screwball-level marital comedy, some really rather impressive emoting. It also helped, of course, that there was a real-life backstory to the relationship between her and her co-star, Brad Pitt: this, of course, was the film set where \u201cBrangelina\u201d was born. Oddly enough, this film stands as a comic companion piece to By the Sea: it\u2019s also about a jaded marriage flailing around for reinvigoration. It says something, though, that while Mr &amp; Mrs Smith is a lot of fun, no one could mistake it for a masterpiece: Jolie, without doubt a stone-cold superstar, tends to be better and/or bigger than the films she has been in. But she has plenty of time to put that right. Maleficent: Mistress of Evil is released in the UK and US on 18 October",

      "bodyText": "The regulator has allowed energy network companies to make bigger than expected profits at the expense of household bills, according to its own state of the market report. Ofgem admitted the companies that run Britain\u2019s energy pipes and wires had earned double-digit returns in the last year despite its efforts to keep a lid on energy bills. The regulator oversees the business plans of regional gas and electricity networks to keep a rein on how much each firms can spend on their infrastructure, and how much they can claim back through energy bills. It said that with hindsight it had set the rate of return too high, and that some companies had managed to spend less than planned, to rake in higher profits. The uncomfortable evaluation has emerged following Ofgem\u2019s decision to appoint its head of networks as its new chief executive. Jonathan Brearley will replace Dermot Nolan when he steps down in February next year. It said: \u201cThe overall costs to consumers of the transmission and distribution networks have turned out to be higher than they needed to be.\u201d The admission is likely to anger critics of the companies, including UK Power Networks and National Grid, who have warned that networks are hiking up household energy bills while paying bumper shareholder payouts to foreign investors. It could also embolden the Labour party\u2019s nationalisation agenda which includes a pledge to bring the networks back under public control to end \u201crip-off\u201d energy bills. Dr Alan Whitehead, the shadow minister for energy and climate change, said: \u201cWhen it comes to the excess profits of network companies, Ofgem were asleep at the wheel. Their payment framework forces them to try and predict the future, years in advance, which was easily gamed and exploited by some network companies. Labour would scrap this senseless system by bringing energy networks back into public ownership to be run democratically, for the public good, and without ripping off bill payers.\u201d David Smith, the chief executive of the Energy Networks Association, said the cost of Britain\u2019s energy pipes and wires \u201care almost a fifth lower than they were at the time of privatisation in 1990\u201d \u2013 and would fall further. He said: \u201cThe energy networks have delivered for the bill payer while playing an integral role in the move to a low-carbon economy. The way we deliver energy has never been more reliable, backed by record levels of investment.\u201d However, the regulator\u2019s renewed concern over network company profits has emerged as the companies face scrutiny over their role in the August blackouts which left 1m homes without electricity, including a hospital and Newcastle airport. Some networks managed to earn a 10% return on their investment, compared with falling profit margins of only 3% for the UK\u2019s largest energy suppliers which are losing customers to a new crop of upstart energy suppliers. Ofgem said its decision to encourage more players into the market had helped to increase competition and switching rates. But it admitted this strategy had led to a five-fold increase in the number of customer complaints to the energy ombudsman because many small suppliers are not financially stable enough to provide adequate service. The ombudsman accepted more than 100 complaints for every 100,000 customers of small suppliers in the first quarter of this year, compared with about 20 cases in the first quarter of 2017. The regulator said a fifth of consumers switched supplier in the last year while the proportion of homes which have never switched more than once has fallen from more than 60% to less than 50%.",

      "bodyText": "Campaigners have lost a high court challenge over new laws that prevent EU citizens living in Britain from finding out what data the Home Office holds on them. The3million group had challenged an exemption clause in the Data Protection Act that came into force last year, which denies them the right to access their personal records in immigration cases. But in a ruling on Thursday, Mr Justice Supperstone concluded the exemption was not unlawful. The judge said there was a \u201cparticular concern\u201d among the campaigners because EU citizens would have to apply for settled status if they wished to continue living in the UK after Brexit. He also recognised the chief inspector of borders and immigration had said there was a 10% error rate in immigration status checks. However, Supperstone found there were safeguards within the act to provide people with effective remedies in the case of any error. The case against the home secretary and the culture secretary was brought in conjunction with the Open Rights Group, a digital campaigning organisation. In a joint statement with the3million, they said they were disappointed with the ruling and had applied for permission to appeal. They said the act remained a \u201cblunt\u201d instrument that could prevent justice in immigration cases involving EU citizens. \u201cWe still believe that the immigration exemption in the Data Protection Act 2018 as it stands breaches fundamental rights,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIt is a blunt instrument, poorly defined and ripe for abuse. Access to data is key for an accountable system that corrects errors in an immigration system that occur at an alarming rate. \u201cThe importance of this can\u2019t be underestimated. Millions of EU citizens must navigate the Home Office application process to stay in the UK. \u201cThis exemption removes that ability to correct errors, which could prove decisive in immigration decisions whether to allow a person to remain in the United Kingdom.\u201d The law firm Leigh Day, which represented the campaign groups, said the exemption affected all 3.6 million EU citizens who will have to apply for a new immigration status after Brexit. They had argued the exemption unlawfully excluded EU citizens from rights they would otherwise have to the disclosure of data held by the government. They said 60% of the requests for disclosure had been denied since the beginning of 2019 using this exemption, leaving migrant workers and others unable to appeal against Home Office decisions. Rosa Curling, a lawyer at Leigh Day, said \u201cMillions of people are already feeling uncertain and anxious about their immigration status as we approach Brexit, and our clients feel that the immigration exemption adds a further layer of uncertainty by removing transparency and the opportunity to correct mistakes in the immigration system.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The wildcard games have been decided and the business end of the season is now upon us. Nothing is guaranteed in the postseason but we\u2019ve ranked the teams in rough order of strength as the battle hots up.</p> <h2><strong>8) </strong>Atlanta Braves (regular season <strong>record: 97-65)</strong></h2> <p><strong>Current form: </strong>The Braves built on an upstart 2018 playoff berth with an outstanding 2019 season. Their 97 wins were the most for the team since 2003.</p> <p><strong>How they can win:</strong> This is a more balanced unit than the team that entered the 2018 postseason. Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr hit 40 homers and stole 37 bases. Mike Soroka \u2013 at 22, just a year older than Acu\u00f1a \u2013 lost just four of his 29 starts. With veterans like first baseman Freddie Freeman, third baseman Josh Donaldson and pitcher Dallas Keuchel, the Braves are a pennant contender.</p> <p><strong>How they can lose: </strong>The Braves traded for two relievers \u2013 Mark Melancon and Shane Greene \u2013 to fortify a shaky bullpen, and neither of them were very consistent. Melancon improved in September and didn\u2019t allow a run over his final seven appearances, but it\u2019s not a trustworthy collection.</p> <p><strong>Player to watch: Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr</strong>. He\u2019s a generational talent and is one of the most thrilling players to watch hit, run the bases and play centerfield since Ken Griffey Jr.</p> <p><strong>Why should you care? </strong>They are a young, exciting team that plays with the kind of flair once dismissed as arrogant by traditionalists. They\u2019re exciting, they\u2019re talented and they always appear to be having fun.</p> <h2>7) Washington Nationals (regular-season record: 93-69)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ac6c24ba0f83839221cd4cfcfbe87b96f4f7772c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac6c24ba0f83839221cd4cfcfbe87b96f4f7772c/0_0_4198_2798/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Washington are still alive after a thrilling wildcard win over the Milwaukee Brewers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Washington are still alive after a thrilling wildcard win over the Milwaukee Brewers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Geoff Burke/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Current form: </strong>After losing 31 of their first 50 games, the Nationals surged to a 93-69 record. On Tuesday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/01/nationals-brewers-nl-wild-card\">they advanced to the NLDS</a> after scoring three late runs in a thrilling 4-3 comeback win over the Milwaukee Brewers in the wildcard playoff. They\u2019ll face the Dodgers starting Thursday.</p> <p><strong>How they can win: </strong>The Nationals have a ton of talent, they have just struggle to maximize it. Stars Max Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg both pitched on Tuesday, so they\u2019ll turn to lefty Patrick Corbin \u2013 who has a 0.59 ERA in his past five starts against Los Angeles \u2013 to start Game 1. MVP candidate Anthony Rendon (.319/.412/.598, 34 home runs) and 20-year-old Juan Soto (.282/.401/.548, 34 home runs) lead the offense.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/21/boston-red-sox-miss-playoffs-mlb\">How the greatest Red Sox team in history turned into an embarrassment</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>How they can lose: </strong>Their bullpen is laughable. Outside of righty Daniel Hudson (1.44 ERA), no regular Nationals relief pitcher finished with an ERA under 3.91.</p> <p><strong>Player to watch: </strong>Shortstop Trea Turner lacks plate discipline (43 walks to 113 strikeouts), but his speed (35 stolen bases in 40 attempts) and power (19 home runs) can alter a playoff series.</p> <p><strong>Why should you care? </strong>The Nationals have not won a playoff series since moving from Montreal in 2005. After Tuesday\u2019s miraculous win over Milwaukee, are they ready to finally make a World Series run? Or does another cruel end to the season await?</p> <h2>6) Minnesota Twins (<strong>regular-season record: 101-61)</strong></h2> <p><strong>Current form: </strong>Few thought the Twins would win the AL Central, but rookie manager Rocco Baldelli guided a young, powerful offense and a consistent pitching staff to their first division title since 2010. Their 101 wins were the franchise\u2019s highest regular-season win total since 1965.</p> <p><strong>How they can win:</strong> The Twins hit a MLB-record 307 home runs in 2019. Five different players hit more than 30 homers and six different players set their career-highs in that category. In short, they crush the ball and are equipped to win high-scoring games.</p> <p><strong>How they can lose: </strong>The Twins don\u2019t have the quality of starting pitching that their opponents do. Twenty-five year-old ace Jose Berrios is prone to inconsistency. The permanently under-appreciated and durable Jake Odorizzi will likely start Game 2. After that, it gets dicey: they may turn to the struggling Martin Perez or gamble on rookie Randy Dobnak, who allowed just two earned runs in three September starts.</p> <p><strong>Key player: Nelson Cruz</strong> signed a one-year deal with the Twins in the offseason and finished 2019 in the top-five of every statistic measuring hard-hit balls. At 38 years old, Cruz remains one of baseball\u2019s elite power hitters.</p> <p><strong>Why should you care? </strong>They\u2019re a small-market team trying to dethrone the mighty Yankees by playing the same brand of power-focused baseball. There will be plenty of offense for fans to enjoy.</p> <h2>5) St Louis Cardinals (regular-season <strong>record: 91-71)</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"17a8214a788a8573823605464b56753b7287e2e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/17a8214a788a8573823605464b56753b7287e2e4/0_75_4468_2680/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yadier Molina brings plenty of experience for the Cardinals behind the plate\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yadier Molina brings plenty of experience for the Cardinals behind the plate.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tannen Maury/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Current form: </strong>St Louis return to the playoffs after an uncharacteristic three-year absence and feature plenty of familiar faces \u2013 catcher Yadier Molina and infielder Matt Carpenter among them.</p> <p><strong>How they can win:</strong> While most teams emphasize home runs and strikeouts, St Louis values putting the ball in play and pitching to soft contact. The Cardinals finished 24th in home runs in 2019 while no other division winner finished lower than eighth.</p> <p><strong>How they can lose: </strong>This team can\u2019t win high-scoring games. The Cardinals finished last among all playoff qualifiers in runs scored (729) but possess a strong run differential (+102) because of their reliable pitching. To win, they must avoid surrendering more than five runs.</p> <p><strong>Key player: Jack Flaherty. </strong>Over his last 15 starts, Flaherty compiled a 0.91 ERA, 11.2 strikeouts per nine innings and limited opposing hitters to a .142 batting average.</p> <p><strong>Why should you care? </strong>The Cardinals\u2019 last two championship teams were not the best in baseball before starting the playoffs. Sometimes, culture is powerful when playing playoff games, and St Louis historically do it better than pretty much any other franchise.</p> <h2>4) Tampa Bay Rays (regular-season record: 96-66)</h2> <p><strong>Current form: </strong>The Rays defeated the Oakland Athletics, 5-1, in the AL wildcard game by hitting four home runs and not allowing an extra-base hit. With an innovative pitching strategy and a lineup of undervalued hitters, the Rays, whose payroll totals $53m, finished the season ahead of the defending champion Boston Red Sox, whose payroll is $204 million.</p> <p><strong>How they can win: </strong>The Rays are masters of deceiving opposing hitters. It doesn\u2019t matter who starts the game in Tampa; manager Kevin Cash will use five or more pitchers in a game so the opposing lineup is never comfortable or familiar. Names like Nick Anderson, Emilio Pagan and Diego Castillo are unknown to casual fans, but are some of the most effective pitchers in the game.</p> <p><strong>How they can lose: </strong>If any of their top relief pitchers struggle, the bullpen is subject to severe fatigue that won\u2019t endure a month of playoff pressure.</p> <p><strong>Key Player: </strong>No single player epitomizes the Rays\u2019 success, but outfielder Yandy Diaz demonstrates why they\u2019re such a remarkable franchise. Diaz entered 2019 with one career home run in 299 plate appearances. On Wednesday, he hit two majestic opposite-field home runs to help clinch an ALDS berth.</p> <p><strong>Why should you care? </strong>The Rays have the smallest payroll in baseball and are littered with players forgotten or cut by richer organizations. There may not be a bigger underdog in American sports.</p> <h2>3) New York Yankees (regular-season)<strong> record: 103-59</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"603deb18b4c83bba9f9065e79d13e1ec231211e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/603deb18b4c83bba9f9065e79d13e1ec231211e1/0_46_4834_2901/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aaron Judge is part of a formidable power-hitting line-up for the Yankees\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aaron Judge is part of a formidable power-hitting line-up for the Yankees.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brad Penner/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>How they can win:</strong> Much like the Twins, their opponents in the Divisional Series, the Yankees crush the ball. Minnesota set a MLB record this season with 307 home runs; the Yankees hit 306. And that was despite getting just 18 games from one of the game\u2019s most feared power hitters, Giancarlo Stanton. In a season where the home run is king and great offenses are commonplace, the Yankees\u2019 batting still stands out.</p> <p><strong>How they can lose: </strong>It\u2019s unclear how the Yankees plan on using their starting pitchers in the playoffs, primarily because none of them have been very reliable outside of Game 1 starter James Paxton. The Yankees have the game\u2019s best bullpen, but they risk overworking it without reliable performances from starters beyond Paxton and ace Luis Severino, who has started just three games this season due to injury.</p> <p><strong>Key Player: Luis Severino. </strong>The flamethrowing righty is one of the game\u2019s best starters when he\u2019s healthy, but his light workload in 2019 is worrisome entering the postseason. If he\u2019s his usual self, the Yankees are equipped to make the World Series. If he\u2019s not, manager Aaron Boone risks exhausting his bullpen.</p> <p><strong>Why should you care? </strong>Every Aaron Judge at-bat is a masterclass in hitting, the bullpen features three different pitchers who appear to defy physics with their breaking pitches and Yankee Stadium remains an intimidating environments for any opposing team.</p> <h2>2) Los Angeles Dodgers (regular-season <strong>record: 106-56)</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d185cd2d1771e2e6204b65540360d2ea46b32283\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d185cd2d1771e2e6204b65540360d2ea46b32283/0_0_2376_1584/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clayton Kershaw has developed a reputation for shaky performances in the postseason\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clayton Kershaw has developed a reputation for shaky performances in the postseason.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Camporeale/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Current form: </strong>The Dodgers exceeded their lofty standards by setting a franchise record with 106 wins.

      "bodyText": "The wildcard games have been decided and the business end of the season is now upon us. Nothing is guaranteed in the postseason but we\u2019ve ranked the teams in rough order of strength as the battle hots up. 8) Atlanta Braves (regular season record: 97-65) Current form: The Braves built on an upstart 2018 playoff berth with an outstanding 2019 season. Their 97 wins were the most for the team since 2003. How they can win: This is a more balanced unit than the team that entered the 2018 postseason. Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr hit 40 homers and stole 37 bases. Mike Soroka \u2013 at 22, just a year older than Acu\u00f1a \u2013 lost just four of his 29 starts. With veterans like first baseman Freddie Freeman, third baseman Josh Donaldson and pitcher Dallas Keuchel, the Braves are a pennant contender. How they can lose: The Braves traded for two relievers \u2013 Mark Melancon and Shane Greene \u2013 to fortify a shaky bullpen, and neither of them were very consistent. Melancon improved in September and didn\u2019t allow a run over his final seven appearances, but it\u2019s not a trustworthy collection. Player to watch: Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr. He\u2019s a generational talent and is one of the most thrilling players to watch hit, run the bases and play centerfield since Ken Griffey Jr. Why should you care? They are a young, exciting team that plays with the kind of flair once dismissed as arrogant by traditionalists. They\u2019re exciting, they\u2019re talented and they always appear to be having fun. 7) Washington Nationals (regular-season record: 93-69) Current form: After losing 31 of their first 50 games, the Nationals surged to a 93-69 record. On Tuesday, they advanced to the NLDS after scoring three late runs in a thrilling 4-3 comeback win over the Milwaukee Brewers in the wildcard playoff. They\u2019ll face the Dodgers starting Thursday. How they can win: The Nationals have a ton of talent, they have just struggle to maximize it. Stars Max Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg both pitched on Tuesday, so they\u2019ll turn to lefty Patrick Corbin \u2013 who has a 0.59 ERA in his past five starts against Los Angeles \u2013 to start Game 1. MVP candidate Anthony Rendon (.319/.412/.598, 34 home runs) and 20-year-old Juan Soto (.282/.401/.548, 34 home runs) lead the offense. How they can lose: Their bullpen is laughable. Outside of righty Daniel Hudson (1.44 ERA), no regular Nationals relief pitcher finished with an ERA under 3.91. Player to watch: Shortstop Trea Turner lacks plate discipline (43 walks to 113 strikeouts), but his speed (35 stolen bases in 40 attempts) and power (19 home runs) can alter a playoff series. Why should you care? The Nationals have not won a playoff series since moving from Montreal in 2005. After Tuesday\u2019s miraculous win over Milwaukee, are they ready to finally make a World Series run? Or does another cruel end to the season await? 6) Minnesota Twins (regular-season record: 101-61) Current form: Few thought the Twins would win the AL Central, but rookie manager Rocco Baldelli guided a young, powerful offense and a consistent pitching staff to their first division title since 2010. Their 101 wins were the franchise\u2019s highest regular-season win total since 1965. How they can win: The Twins hit a MLB-record 307 home runs in 2019. Five different players hit more than 30 homers and six different players set their career-highs in that category. In short, they crush the ball and are equipped to win high-scoring games. How they can lose: The Twins don\u2019t have the quality of starting pitching that their opponents do. Twenty-five year-old ace Jose Berrios is prone to inconsistency. The permanently under-appreciated and durable Jake Odorizzi will likely start Game 2. After that, it gets dicey: they may turn to the struggling Martin Perez or gamble on rookie Randy Dobnak, who allowed just two earned runs in three September starts. Key player: Nelson Cruz signed a one-year deal with the Twins in the offseason and finished 2019 in the top-five of every statistic measuring hard-hit balls. At 38 years old, Cruz remains one of baseball\u2019s elite power hitters. Why should you care? They\u2019re a small-market team trying to dethrone the mighty Yankees by playing the same brand of power-focused baseball. There will be plenty of offense for fans to enjoy. 5) St Louis Cardinals (regular-season record: 91-71) Current form: St Louis return to the playoffs after an uncharacteristic three-year absence and feature plenty of familiar faces \u2013 catcher Yadier Molina and infielder Matt Carpenter among them. How they can win: While most teams emphasize home runs and strikeouts, St Louis values putting the ball in play and pitching to soft contact. The Cardinals finished 24th in home runs in 2019 while no other division winner finished lower than eighth. How they can lose: This team can\u2019t win high-scoring games. The Cardinals finished last among all playoff qualifiers in runs scored (729) but possess a strong run differential (+102) because of their reliable pitching. To win, they must avoid surrendering more than five runs. Key player: Jack Flaherty. Over his last 15 starts, Flaherty compiled a 0.91 ERA, 11.2 strikeouts per nine innings and limited opposing hitters to a .142 batting average. Why should you care? The Cardinals\u2019 last two championship teams were not the best in baseball before starting the playoffs. Sometimes, culture is powerful when playing playoff games, and St Louis historically do it better than pretty much any other franchise. 4) Tampa Bay Rays (regular-season record: 96-66) Current form: The Rays defeated the Oakland Athletics, 5-1, in the AL wildcard game by hitting four home runs and not allowing an extra-base hit. With an innovative pitching strategy and a lineup of undervalued hitters, the Rays, whose payroll totals $53m, finished the season ahead of the defending champion Boston Red Sox, whose payroll is $204 million. How they can win: The Rays are masters of deceiving opposing hitters. It doesn\u2019t matter who starts the game in Tampa; manager Kevin Cash will use five or more pitchers in a game so the opposing lineup is never comfortable or familiar. Names like Nick Anderson, Emilio Pagan and Diego Castillo are unknown to casual fans, but are some of the most effective pitchers in the game. How they can lose: If any of their top relief pitchers struggle, the bullpen is subject to severe fatigue that won\u2019t endure a month of playoff pressure. Key Player: No single player epitomizes the Rays\u2019 success, but outfielder Yandy Diaz demonstrates why they\u2019re such a remarkable franchise. Diaz entered 2019 with one career home run in 299 plate appearances. On Wednesday, he hit two majestic opposite-field home runs to help clinch an ALDS berth. Why should you care? The Rays have the smallest payroll in baseball and are littered with players forgotten or cut by richer organizations. There may not be a bigger underdog in American sports. 3) New York Yankees (regular-season) record: 103-59 How they can win: Much like the Twins, their opponents in the Divisional Series, the Yankees crush the ball. Minnesota set a MLB record this season with 307 home runs; the Yankees hit 306. And that was despite getting just 18 games from one of the game\u2019s most feared power hitters, Giancarlo Stanton. In a season where the home run is king and great offenses are commonplace, the Yankees\u2019 batting still stands out. How they can lose: It\u2019s unclear how the Yankees plan on using their starting pitchers in the playoffs, primarily because none of them have been very reliable outside of Game 1 starter James Paxton. The Yankees have the game\u2019s best bullpen, but they risk overworking it without reliable performances from starters beyond Paxton and ace Luis Severino, who has started just three games this season due to injury. Key Player: Luis Severino. The flamethrowing righty is one of the game\u2019s best starters when he\u2019s healthy, but his light workload in 2019 is worrisome entering the postseason. If he\u2019s his usual self, the Yankees are equipped to make the World Series. If he\u2019s not, manager Aaron Boone risks exhausting his bullpen. Why should you care? Every Aaron Judge at-bat is a masterclass in hitting, the bullpen features three different pitchers who appear to defy physics with their breaking pitches and Yankee Stadium remains an intimidating environments for any opposing team. 2) Los Angeles Dodgers (regular-season record: 106-56) Current form: The Dodgers exceeded their lofty standards by setting a franchise record with 106 wins. They remain the class of the National League and are heavy favorites to return to the World Series for the third consecutive year. How they can win: The Dodgers won 106 games because of their ability to find production out of untested rookies and utility players. They don\u2019t only possess an elite offense and pitching staff; their incredible depth offsets the injuries and poor performances that often derail other teams. How they can lose: Closer Kenley Jansen was once one of baseball\u2019s most trusted relief pitchers, but compiled the worst season of his career in 2019. If manager Dave Roberts doesn\u2019t trust him in close games, he\u2019ll have to enlist pitchers who lack Jansen\u2019s playoff experience. Player to watch: Cody Bellinger. He is just 24 years old but will likely win NL MVP after hitting .305 with 47 home runs, stealing 15 bases and showcasing elite defense. Bellinger\u2019s physical tools are remarkable, but his defensive instincts and excellent baserunning separate him from comparably talented players. Why should you care? The Dodgers have not won a World Series since 1988. Will Clayton Kershaw, considered by many to be the generation\u2019s best starting pitcher, exorcise his reputation as a poor playoff pitcher and finally win a championship? 1) Houston Astros (regular-season record: 107-55) Current form: The Astros aren\u2019t simply a great team; they\u2019ve built a powerhouse through meticulous research, expert player development and savvy acquisitions. They set a franchise record with 107 wins this season and are expected by most pundits to win their second championship in three years. How they can win: It feels impossible to win four times in seven games against them when three elite pitchers \u2013 Gerrit Cole, Justin Verlander and Zack Greinke \u2013 are starting the first three games.

On a team full of young stars, Bregman might be the best. Why should you care? The Astros are the clear favorites to win in a field with two other elite teams in the Yankees and Dodgers. Even if they don\u2019t win the title, what they\u2019ve built is simply remarkable.",

      "body": "<p>There are artists who seem to explode into the public consciousness at first sight, and there are artists whose career gradually builds to a tipping point. That\u2019s where Angel Olsen would appear to find herself. She started life as the kind of artist it seemed easy to peg. Her sound was literate, folky, lo-fi and downcast. She had graduated from releasing EPs and cassettes to a deal with US indie <a href=\"https://jagjaguwar.com/\">Jagjaguwar</a>, a label that\u2019s released a lot of great music, but almost always of a certain stripe: \u201c8.8 from Pitchfork\u201d could be their in-house slogan. But Olsen\u2019s third album, 2016\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/01/angel-olsen-my-woman-review-beautiful-songs-full-of-things-to-pore-over\">My Woman</a>, signified a noticeable shift: less introverted, more polished, poppy, and occasionally electronic, it also boasted a hitherto-unnoticed tendency to rock in a straightforward style. It didn\u2019t just get 8.8 from Pitchfork, it broke the lower reaches of the US Top 50 and spawned a successful single in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nleRCBhLr3k\">Shut Up Kiss Me</a>, a song that you can imagine rousing a huge festival crowd. A bit more of that, ran the general consensus, and mainstream success was a given: an assumption bolstered by her guest appearance on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/mark-ronson\">Mark Ronson</a>\u2019s recent album <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/21/mark-ronson-late-night-feelings-review\">Late Night Feelings</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a94481f056085c0edfd20a74c84a8632bbc6af3c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a94481f056085c0edfd20a74c84a8632bbc6af3c/0_0_500_500/500.jpg\" alt=\"Angel Olsen: All Mirrors album art work\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Angel Olsen: All Mirrors album art work</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Or perhaps not. Three years on, the opening of Olsen\u2019s follow-up suggests that the unexpected shift of My Woman told you more about Olsen\u2019s interest in unexpected shifts than her desire to be a mainstream star. On paper, Lark doesn\u2019t seem like anything particularly out of the ordinary: it\u2019s a heavily orchestrated ballad, on which strings are bolstered by thundering, Phil Spector-ish drums, and we\u2019ve all heard a lot of those over the years. But the arrangement of Lark doesn\u2019t cleave to the standard epic alt-rock ballad mode: it isn\u2019t trying to mimic the high drama of Scott Walker\u2019s late 60s albums, nor the romantic lushness of the Beach Boys circa Pet Sounds, nor the cinematic swoon of Serge Gainsbourg\u2019s Histoire de Melody Nelson, nor any of the other things that alt-rock artists tend to do when they decide to favour the world with an epic ballad. Instead, the strings drone and churn and, occasionally, screech, as if signifying a moment of alarm on the soundtrack of an old thriller. The song itself is beautiful, but the arrangement seems constantly on the verge of dissonance, which lends the track tension and edge. What should on the face of it feel familiar feels anything but.</p> <p>That seems to be as close as All Mirrors gets to a USP: it\u2019s an album that keeps taking ostensibly recognisable musical forms and twisting them out of shape into something challenging and intriguing. The title track deals in a certain kind of alt-rock\u2019s current favourite mode \u2013 80s-influenced synths drifting dreamily along \u2013 and shifts its mood completely. Olsen starts out singing in the standard blank-eyed style that goes with dreamy 80s synths, but gradually ratchets up the intensity until it feels discomfiting. Then another off-kilter string arrangement crashes in: the effect isn\u2019t lush so much as oppressive, deliberately crowded with sound.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uaN60k0-zY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6uaN60k0-zY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Angel Olsen: Lark \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Spring starts life with a piano modulating in Hey Jude style, but quickly turns odd. Olsen\u2019s vocal is dry and deliberately high in the mix: for all the prettiness of the melody she\u2019s singing, the effect is weirdly claustrophobic, a sensation increased by a burst of queasily out-of-tune synthesised bells.

      "bodyText": "There are artists who seem to explode into the public consciousness at first sight, and there are artists whose career gradually builds to a tipping point. That\u2019s where Angel Olsen would appear to find herself. She started life as the kind of artist it seemed easy to peg. Her sound was literate, folky, lo-fi and downcast. She had graduated from releasing EPs and cassettes to a deal with US indie Jagjaguwar, a label that\u2019s released a lot of great music, but almost always of a certain stripe: \u201c8.8 from Pitchfork\u201d could be their in-house slogan. But Olsen\u2019s third album, 2016\u2019s My Woman, signified a noticeable shift: less introverted, more polished, poppy, and occasionally electronic, it also boasted a hitherto-unnoticed tendency to rock in a straightforward style. It didn\u2019t just get 8.8 from Pitchfork, it broke the lower reaches of the US Top 50 and spawned a successful single in Shut Up Kiss Me, a song that you can imagine rousing a huge festival crowd. A bit more of that, ran the general consensus, and mainstream success was a given: an assumption bolstered by her guest appearance on Mark Ronson\u2019s recent album Late Night Feelings. Or perhaps not. Three years on, the opening of Olsen\u2019s follow-up suggests that the unexpected shift of My Woman told you more about Olsen\u2019s interest in unexpected shifts than her desire to be a mainstream star. On paper, Lark doesn\u2019t seem like anything particularly out of the ordinary: it\u2019s a heavily orchestrated ballad, on which strings are bolstered by thundering, Phil Spector-ish drums, and we\u2019ve all heard a lot of those over the years. But the arrangement of Lark doesn\u2019t cleave to the standard epic alt-rock ballad mode: it isn\u2019t trying to mimic the high drama of Scott Walker\u2019s late 60s albums, nor the romantic lushness of the Beach Boys circa Pet Sounds, nor the cinematic swoon of Serge Gainsbourg\u2019s Histoire de Melody Nelson, nor any of the other things that alt-rock artists tend to do when they decide to favour the world with an epic ballad. Instead, the strings drone and churn and, occasionally, screech, as if signifying a moment of alarm on the soundtrack of an old thriller. The song itself is beautiful, but the arrangement seems constantly on the verge of dissonance, which lends the track tension and edge. What should on the face of it feel familiar feels anything but. That seems to be as close as All Mirrors gets to a USP: it\u2019s an album that keeps taking ostensibly recognisable musical forms and twisting them out of shape into something challenging and intriguing. The title track deals in a certain kind of alt-rock\u2019s current favourite mode \u2013 80s-influenced synths drifting dreamily along \u2013 and shifts its mood completely. Olsen starts out singing in the standard blank-eyed style that goes with dreamy 80s synths, but gradually ratchets up the intensity until it feels discomfiting. Then another off-kilter string arrangement crashes in: the effect isn\u2019t lush so much as oppressive, deliberately crowded with sound. Spring starts life with a piano modulating in Hey Jude style, but quickly turns odd. Olsen\u2019s vocal is dry and deliberately high in the mix: for all the prettiness of the melody she\u2019s singing, the effect is weirdly claustrophobic, a sensation increased by a burst of queasily out-of-tune synthesised bells. You would describe Endgame as atmospheric and ambient, were it not for the fact that those adjectives suggest something soothing and warm, and the atmosphere Endgame conjures up is sickly and distended, occasionally lapsing into eerie silence. Olsen\u2019s voice suddenly loses its swathe of reverb, sounding in the process as if she\u2019s singing in your ear. A solitary beam of warm light in an otherwise dark and disturbing album comes with the closer Chance, a straightforwardly beautiful, if vocally wracked, ballad that looks to 50s doo wop for inspiration. The lyrics suggest that a break-up is at the heart of All Mirrors\u2019 stylistic shifts: the first words you hear on the album are \u201cto forget you is too hard\u201d; the relatively upbeat Chance grasps gingerly at the prospect of reconciliation or new love. What\u2019s striking about what happens in between is how skilful it is at upending the listener\u2019s preconceptions, never turning out quite as you assume it will.

Summers, who is not known for cultural or political nuance, reported that he had been on holiday across the US. Not only that, but he\u2019d gone by car. This pioneering spirit yielded such insights as that the centre of the country is sparsely populated and surprisingly oblivious to events on the east and west coasts. Summers was a changed man.</p> <p>Why had this latter-day Jack Kerouac not understood his own country before? Summers explained that \u201ceconomists like me see the world through the prism of models\u201d.

Nevertheless, the shocks of the past three years have provoked overdue curiosity about precarious employment, the housing crisis and the cultural margins, which are rarely dramatic enough to attract media or political attention. It\u2019s not just Brexit: between spring 2017 and spring 2018, Britain also witnessed Theresa May being confronted by the hard truth of austerity, Corbyn\u2019s electoral surge, the horror of the Grenfell tragedy, and the appalling details of the Windrush scandal.

The worry in 2019 is that bogus conflicts, rooted in lies and scapegoats, are stealing our attention from the real ones that Shenker traces. If our political elites had shown some of his curiosity towards everyday struggles across Britain, and some of his compassion towards the strugglers, we wouldn\u2019t have reached this pass in the first place. \u2022 Now We Have Your Attention by Jack Shenker is published by Bodley Head (\u00a316.99).

In February, the state\u2019s Health Service Executive secured a high court injunction against an anti-abortion activist, Eamonn Murphy, for setting up a website with an almost identical domain name as the government\u2019s unplanned pregnancy advice service My Options, which provides official information on abortion in Ireland and has a helpline that informs patients about which GPs offer terminations. The website Murphy set up looked like a neutral site offering ultrasounds and information on abortion, but <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/courts/high-court/hse-secures-injunction-against-allegedly-misleading-pregnancy-website-1.3795141\" title=\"\">the HSE argued that his aim was to dissuade people from seeking terminations</a>. </p> <p>There have been <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/women-s-centre-linked-to-illegal-adoption-vmkzbjrh3\" title=\"\">many reports of unregulated crisis-pregnancy agencies</a> putting pregnant people through traumatic and coercive experiences, including unnecessarily invasive physical exams, being made to watch graphic videos and being threatened with unproven claims that a termination would cause cancer, death and the breakdown of mental health and relationships. The health minister is introducing new registration requirements for counsellors, but these could take years to come into effect. There have also been concerns about patient information being leaked to anti-choice groups. It was reported this year that a patient who had a medical abortion in a Dublin hospital in January <a href=\"https://www.thejournal.ie/alleged-leak-patient-details-abortion-4469519-Jan2019/\" title=\"\">was allegedly later contacted by an anti-abortion activist from an unregulated counselling service who abused her over the phone</a>, calling her \u201cdisgusting\u201d for terminating her pregnancy.</p> <p>Anti-abortion groups and crisis pregnancy agencies continue to suggest adoption as an easy alternative to terminating a pregnancy. Adoption is listed on the state\u2019s My Options website along with other support. Some within the Catholic church in Ireland have even suggested a return to mother-and-baby homes as an alternative to abortion rights. For decades, these religious-run institutions confined women who were pregnant outside marriage as \u201coffenders\u201d, separating them from their children. One mother-and-baby home operated until 2006 in close coordination with Catholic crisis pregnancy agencies. Yet, last year, after the vote to repeal, a priest sent a letter to a local newspaper <a href=\"https://www.shemazing.net/priest-reccomends-mother-and-baby-homes-be-reintroduced-as-abortion-alternative/\" title=\"\">suggesting that the department of health consider providing these kinds of homes</a>, with the \u201cpractical and beneficial spin-off\u201d that \u201cinfertile couples could adopt \u2018unwanted\u2019 babies in Ireland\u201d.

She talked to him about the life-long trauma of being confined as a teenager in an institution run by nuns to have her baby, and then separated from him through adoption \u2013 feeling as if she had no choice at any stage.

The runaway beast was one of two zebras that escaped from their cages when the travelling Circus Barlay pitched up at a new location in Tessin in north-east Germany in the early hours of Wednesday. While the first zebra was captured and returned to the zoo, the second animal, known as Pumba, ran on to a stretch of the A20 motorway near Rostock, causing an accident between two cars as they swerved to avoid it. While neither of the drivers were injured, one police officer was left with slight injuries after attempting to catch the animal by hand. One car was damaged when Pumba ran across its bonnet. At 11.30am on Wednesday, after several failed attempts to contain the zebra and to the dismay of the circus\u2019s employees, the animal was shot dead by a rescue officer. The circumstances that led to the firing of the lethal bullet have been disputed. According to a spokesperson for the Rostock city authorities, the use of a tranquilliser dart had not been an option since the \u201cuncontainable\u201d zebra posed a threat and had to be shot from a distance of 60 metres.

The American president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/01/mike-pompeo-trump-impeachment-inquiry-democrats-ukraine\">facing a growing clamour for his impeachment</a>, used his address to the United Nations General Assembly as a partisan stump speech to rally his base ahead of his 2020 re-election bid.

Australia must always seek to have a responsible and participative international agency in addressing global issues, engaging in what he called \u201cpositive and practical globalism\u201d, he said.</p> <p>But Morrison said it did not serve the national interest \u201cwhen international institutions demand conformity rather than independent cooperation on global issues\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe world works best when the character and distinctiveness of independent nations is preserved within a framework of mutual respect,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cThis includes respecting electoral mandates of their constituencies.</p> <p>\u201cGlobalism must facilitate, align and engage, rather than direct and centralise, as such an approach can corrode support for joint international action.\u201d</p> <p>Morrison on Thursday night paraphrased the 2001 sovereignty credo of the former Liberal prime minister John Howard \u2013 we will decide who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come \u2013 declaring that under his prime ministership, in foreign policy terms, \u201cwe will decide our interests and the circumstances in which we seek to pursue them\u201d.</p> <p>He said Australia would take a more proactive role in setting global standards underpinning commerce, investment and exchange. \u201cWe cannot afford to leave it to others to set the standards that will shape our global economy.\u201d</p> <p>Morrison said he had asked the department of foreign affairs to undertake a comprehensive audit of global institutions and rule-making processes where Australia had the greatest stake.</p> <p>He said the world had entered a new era of strategic competition and there were \u201ccontinuing security threats from terrorism, extremist Islam, antisemitism, white supremacism, and evil on a local and global level\u201d.</p> <p>He contended pragmatic international engagement, based on the cooperation of sovereign nation states, was \u201cbeing challenged by a new variant of globalism that seeks to elevate global institutions above the authority of nation states to direct national policies\u201d \u2013 although he didn\u2019t give concrete examples.</p> <p>Morrison said complexities on the world stage coexisted with polarisation within and between societies, and an \u201cera in which elite opinion and attitudes have often become disconnected from the mainstream of their societies, and a sense of resentment and disappointment has emerged\u201d.</p> <p>The prime minister said we lived in an era of \u201cinsiders and outsiders, threatening social cohesion, provoking discontent and distrust\u201d.</p> <p>But he counselled in favour of optimism. He said we were not the only generation to face complexity and adversity. Morrison said he grew up under the threat of nuclear Armageddon, his parents endured the second world war, and his grandparents the first world war.</p> <p>Morrison said at every stage of our history, Australia had played its part as a force for good, in partnership with those who shared our outlook and our values.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/24/australian-pm-says-china-must-step-up-on-climate-change-as-newly-developed-nation\">Australian PM says China must step up on climate change as 'newly developed' nation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He said the key to prospering through the transitions \u201cwas individual, like-minded sovereign nations acting together with enlightened self-interest\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Scott Morrison has declared sovereign nations need to eschew an \u201cunaccountable internationalist bureaucracy\u201d and the world needs to avoid \u201cnegative globalism\u201d in a major foreign policy lecture at the Lowy Institute. A week after Donald Trump used a speech to the United Nations to declare the future belonged to patriots, not globalists, Morrison echoed the American president\u2019s nationalist tone, telling the foreign policy thinktank \u201conly a national government, especially one accountable through the ballot box and the rule of law, can define its national interests\u201d. \u201cWe can never answer to a higher authority than the people of Australia,\u201d the prime minister said. Morrison\u2019s line to the Lowy Institute on Thursday night was not as strident as Trump\u2019s. The American president, facing a growing clamour for his impeachment, used his address to the United Nations General Assembly as a partisan stump speech to rally his base ahead of his 2020 re-election bid. Trump railed against globalism, which he claimed had \u201cexerted a religious pall over past leaders causing them to ignore their own national interests\u201d. The Australian prime minister\u2019s arguments were more nuanced. He said isolationism and protectionism were not in the national interest. Australia must always seek to have a responsible and participative international agency in addressing global issues, engaging in what he called \u201cpositive and practical globalism\u201d, he said. But Morrison said it did not serve the national interest \u201cwhen international institutions demand conformity rather than independent cooperation on global issues\u201d. \u201cThe world works best when the character and distinctiveness of independent nations is preserved within a framework of mutual respect,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cThis includes respecting electoral mandates of their constituencies. \u201cGlobalism must facilitate, align and engage, rather than direct and centralise, as such an approach can corrode support for joint international action.\u201d Morrison on Thursday night paraphrased the 2001 sovereignty credo of the former Liberal prime minister John Howard \u2013 we will decide who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come \u2013 declaring that under his prime ministership, in foreign policy terms, \u201cwe will decide our interests and the circumstances in which we seek to pursue them\u201d. He said Australia would take a more proactive role in setting global standards underpinning commerce, investment and exchange. \u201cWe cannot afford to leave it to others to set the standards that will shape our global economy.\u201d Morrison said he had asked the department of foreign affairs to undertake a comprehensive audit of global institutions and rule-making processes where Australia had the greatest stake. He said the world had entered a new era of strategic competition and there were \u201ccontinuing security threats from terrorism, extremist Islam, antisemitism, white supremacism, and evil on a local and global level\u201d. He contended pragmatic international engagement, based on the cooperation of sovereign nation states, was \u201cbeing challenged by a new variant of globalism that seeks to elevate global institutions above the authority of nation states to direct national policies\u201d \u2013 although he didn\u2019t give concrete examples. Morrison said complexities on the world stage coexisted with polarisation within and between societies, and an \u201cera in which elite opinion and attitudes have often become disconnected from the mainstream of their societies, and a sense of resentment and disappointment has emerged\u201d. The prime minister said we lived in an era of \u201cinsiders and outsiders, threatening social cohesion, provoking discontent and distrust\u201d. But he counselled in favour of optimism. He said we were not the only generation to face complexity and adversity. Morrison said he grew up under the threat of nuclear Armageddon, his parents endured the second world war, and his grandparents the first world war. Morrison said at every stage of our history, Australia had played its part as a force for good, in partnership with those who shared our outlook and our values. He said the key to prospering through the transitions \u201cwas individual, like-minded sovereign nations acting together with enlightened self-interest\u201d. The US had played a critical role \u201cbinding together the liberal democracies of the western world\u201d. \u201cTo preserve this legacy in the face of the uncertainties of our modern world, we must approach the future with the same optimism, confidence and resolve, of previous generations, and through our commitment to the values and beliefs that have always guided our way,\u201d the prime minister said. Morrison also dug in behind the rationale he floated in last week\u2019s address to the Chicago Institute for Global Affairs that China was now a newly developed economy, not a developing one. He said China\u2019s rise had changed the world \u201cso we would expect the terms of its engagement to change too\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s why when we look at negotiating rules of the future of the global economy, for example, we would expect China\u2019s obligations to reflect its greater power status,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a compliment, not a criticism. And that is what I mean when describing China as a newly developed economy. \u201cThe rules and institutions that support global cooperation must reflect the modern world. It can\u2019t be set and forget.\u201d In conversation with Lowy Institute director Michael Fullilove, Morrison said Australia\u2019s currently fractious relationship with China would be managed \u201cin the national interest\u201d. \u201cAnd by being incredibly consistent: we know where our lines are, we know where our benefits are, we know what we share, we know where we disagree \u2026 we are careful in the way we engage, in what we say and what we do. We don\u2019t concede, we don\u2019t step back.\u201d He said he would be happy to accept an invitation to visit Beijing, an honour not afforded an Australian prime minister for more than three years \u201cbut I\u2019m not waiting by the phone, and nor should an Australian prime minister be\u201d. \u201cIf they would like to invite us to come to China, we\u2019d be happy to go \u2026 we should be careful about over-interpreting some of those events ... it\u2019s not troubling me.\u201d Morrison said while the Chinese government\u2019s overt demonstrations of force this week \u2013 the massive military parade marking the 70th anniversary of the PRC and the forcible crackdown on Hong Kong demonstrators \u2013 were \u201chard to miss\u201d, he said was \u201cconstantly surprised by the surprise\u201d that has greeted China\u2019s rise to economic and military eminence. \u201cThis is the inevitable result of the path that we deliberately got on [engaging China in the broader global economy a generation ago], so I think it is important in responding, not to get too emotional or outraged that this has occurred, but simply to practically understand that this is where the world\u2019s economy has got to.\u201d",

Chris Sonnex, artistic director of the Bunker, sips a pint and nods along. We\u2019ve met in one of the many pubs nearby after a day of rehearsals for We Anchor in Hope, Jordan\u2019s play about the closing of a local pub. Jordan was a barmaid for years in her home town of Brentford, supplementing her income while at drama school, while director Sonnex \u201cgrew up\u201d in pubs around Pimlico. During Sonnex\u2019s time as an associate at the Royal Court, he commissioned Jordan to \u201cgo into these pubs, buy people drinks, and just be part of the community\u201d. The aim was that she would write something they both felt accurately depicted the highs and lows of local pub life.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to eulogise it in any way, because it\u2019s problematic in so many ways,\u201d Sonnex says of being taken to pubs from a young age. \u201cThere\u2019s so much that as I kid I really shouldn\u2019t [have seen]. There was a lot of violence, there was a lot of fighting, there was a lot of cheating and sex and drugs and rock\u2019n\u2019roll. It was constant, but part of me looks back at it and goes, \u2018You know what? It was nice, though.\u2019 Because at least it was a community. It might have been shit, it might not always have been great, but quite a lot of the time it was fun. A lot of plays that are working-class-focused always go into a weird stereotype. But that\u2019s not my experience.\u201d Jordan interjects: \u201cWhat, misery?\u201d Sonnex pauses. \u201cYeah. Where\u2019s the joy in it?\u201d Jordan agrees: \u201cIt\u2019s that thing you said that I really love, about your working-class life \u2026\u201d Sonnex smiles and shakes his head. \u201cOh yeah: \u2018It\u2019s all fun and games until it\u2019s not.

But I just thought it was a unique time, when things were starting to go batshit.\u201d</p> <p>The coming together of people, in spite of politics, is what interests Jordan most about pub culture. \u201cMainly, I think it\u2019s a play about community, and about memory. For me, it was emotionally a very difficult time, because my mum died just when we embarked on the project. So I was doing my research, going into these pubs in Pimlico, when I\u2019d lost my mum a month and a half before. I think that\u2019s come out through some of the storylines. But also, I found a lot of what I\u2019ve written since my mum passed away is about memory.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy, I think,\u201d she continues, \u201cif you\u2019re young and haven\u2019t experienced any huge grief or anything yet, to go: \u2018Nostalgia is naff and sentimental.\u2019 But actually, as you get older and start to lose significant people in your life, you realise that people live in memories a lot. I was interested in how a physical place could contain those memories \u2013 but also, how alcohol can resurrect dead people. How it can set you in that moment in time, and freeze you in it, and how alcohol also fucks with memory.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"05d7a6299e6f1730b465f812884a286cfe201f92\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05d7a6299e6f1730b465f812884a286cfe201f92/0_200_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hanson and Alex Jarrett.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Overwhelmingly male spaces\u2019 \u2026 Hanson and Alex Jarrett.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Helen Murray</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The two have thought a lot about the pub that the Bunker is becoming: a quiz every Tuesday, karaoke on Thursdays and a disco on the weekend. The space will be open an hour before the show for people to get a drink, with Sonnex himself pulling pints alongside his general manager, Lee. In the world of the play, the pints in the Anchor pub will be pulled by Pearl, the play\u2019s only woman. \u201cIn the current climate, and rightfully so, you should be looking at the ratio of men to women and making sure there are really good opportunities for female actors,\u201d Jordan tells me. But in order to stay true to the pubs she spent time in, which were \u201coverwhelmingly male spaces\u201d, We Anchor in Hope has \u201cone female character and four male characters \u2013 which is something we both thought about and talked about\u201d. </p> <p>To compensate, Sonnex made the decision to ensure as many women work behind the scenes of the play as possible. \u201cAll the creative team are women; the stage manager, the production manager. I definitely felt I had to offset the fact that there are four men on stage. But also, it was because my experience of being in a pub, as a young boy growing into a man, was a completely different experience to [a woman\u2019s].\u201d The two agree that the mix of voices working on the piece, on and offstage, helped make it stronger.</p> <p>As to what makes a good pub, Jordan is in agreement with Sonnex, who suggests songs \u201ctwo years out of date\u201d, bar staff who don\u2019t take themselves too seriously, and \u201cdefinitely a pool table\u201d. He compares pubs to the theatre, in that both spaces can be unwelcoming to those who are unfamiliar with them, they\u2019re both heavily associated with a particular class of people, and both have a focal point: the stage, or the bar. The pub we\u2019re in, the two agree, is not a good one. Six months before, Sonnex says, it was for locals, but a refurbishment means the old men who once propped up the bar have been replaced with younger people in city-slick suits. Still, Sonnex believes all pubs can have value. \u201cAs long as it provides a space for lonely people to come, I don\u2019t care, really. But let\u2019s not throw people out because they\u2019re this class, or that colour, or they\u2019re this age or whatever.\u201d Jordan agrees: \u201cOr not even throwing them out, but making them feel unwelcome \u2026 that gradual sort of erosion\u201d. Sonnex looks thoughtful and finishes the last of his pint. \u201cMaking them feel uncomfortable \u2026 which, interestingly, is exactly how I feel about theatre.

Still, Sonnex believes all pubs can have value. \u201cAs long as it provides a space for lonely people to come, I don\u2019t care, really. But let\u2019s not throw people out because they\u2019re this class, or that colour, or they\u2019re this age or whatever.\u201d Jordan agrees: \u201cOr not even throwing them out, but making them feel unwelcome \u2026 that gradual sort of erosion\u201d. Sonnex looks thoughtful and finishes the last of his pint. \u201cMaking them feel uncomfortable \u2026 which, interestingly, is exactly how I feel about theatre. If you start pushing people out and making people uncomfortable, then you can go and fucking burn, you know?\u201d We Anchor In Hope is at the Bunker, London, until 19 October",

      "bodyText": "Thousands of migrant construction workers employed on huge infrastructure and building projects ahead of next year\u2019s Expo 2020 exhibition in Dubai are likely to have been exposed to dangerous levels of heat stress, a Guardian investigation has found. Dubai will host the Expo 2020 next year, in which 190 countries will come together to celebrate themes of mobility, innovation and sustainability in a series of bespoke, themed pavilions across a 4.38 sq km site in Dubai South economic zone. Yet a Guardian investigation has found that migrant workers who have been building the infrastructure, accommodation blocks and national pavilions across the summer months could have been working in unsafe and potentially fatal conditions. Construction work for the Expo 2020 began in 2015 and British construction firms including McLaren and Laing O\u2019Rourke are among dozens of foreign companies involved in multi-million-pound construction projects for the global exhibition. To date, 60% of the Expo work has already been completed. The United Arab Emirates is a dangerous place for the hundreds of thousands of migrant labourers who travel from their homes in India, Nepal, Pakistan and Bangladesh to work in the heat and dust of one of the wealthiest countries in the world. Every year hundreds of workers \u2013 mostly young men \u2013 who have travelled from India, Nepal, Pakistan and Bangladesh, die while working in the Gulf state. Worker fatality numbers are difficult to access, but according to data from the Indian government, 5,185 Indian nationals died between 2012\u20132017. Many of these deaths are recorded as cardiovascular events such as respiratory failure, cardiac arrest or \u201cnatural deaths\u201d. Of the 126 \u201cblue collar\u201d workers the Indian government said died in the UAE last year, 70% were recorded as dying from heart attacks. Heat places a huge strain on the cardiovascular system with extreme heat stress leading to potentially fatal heart attacks and other cardiovascular failures. Recent research by cardiologists and climatologists concluded that exposure to extreme heat stress was linked to the deaths of hundreds of Nepali migrant workers in Qatar, which has similar weather conditions to the UAE. The authorities in the UAE, in line with other countries across the Gulf, has said they are protecting workers from heat-related injuries through a work ban that prohibits manual labour in unshaded outdoor areas between 12.30\u20133pm from June\u2013August. However the Guardian\u2019s weather analysis found that the summer work ban in the UAE does not keep workers safe. Anyone working outside who is performing even moderate physical labour is exposed to potentially fatal levels of heat stress for the majority of the working day from June\u2013September every year. British companies McLaren and Laing O\u2019Rourke are currently working on Expo 2020 projects. The UK\u2019s Department for International Trade awarded the \u00a321m contract to build the UK Expo 2020 pavilion, which is inspired by Stephen Hawking\u2019s \u201cbreakthrough message\u201d initiative, to Pico and McLaren. McLaren is also working on construction at Dubai airport. Laing O\u2019Rourke is working on a contract to build the Leadership and Media pavilions, as well as the \u201cHammerhead\u201d access road to the central event space for Expo 2020 Dubai. The companies said that they have robust heat strategies in place that go above and beyond the 12\u20133pm summer work ban imposed by the UAE government. McLaren said that construction work on the UK pavilion is being timed to coincide with cooler temperatures. It also has detailed heat mitigation measures in place including chilled welfare areas, shaded rest areas on site and amended work schedules based on expected heat levels. Laing O\u2019Rourke said that it had specific summer working policies in place and well-defined procedures on how to implement these measures. UK non-profit organisation the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre (BHRRC) said that a survey it conducted of construction companies operating in the UAE last year found that many did not have robust heat monitoring programmes in place. \u201cAlthough British companies are doing comparatively well at taking the issue of heat stress seriously compared to many of their peers, all international construction companies in the UAE operate with an unacceptable level of risk to their workers,\u201d said Diana Eltahawy, Gulf programme manager at BHRRC. The Guardian used weather data from 2008\u20132017 to calculate the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) for UAE, an internationally used metric that uses wind speed, solar radiation, humidity and air temperature to assess the impact of heat stress on the human body. A WGBT reading of 28C (82F) and above is internationally accepted as the point at which the human body is dangerously affected by heat stress. The analysis found: In July, despite the work ban, anyone working outside will have been exposed to dangerous levels of heat stress between 9am-9pm. Between 9am-3pm workers can only safely work outdoors in unshaded areas for a maximum of 15 minutes an hour for almost every day of the month. In June, heat stress exposure was at a dangerous level between 9am\u20136pm. Before the outdoor working ban came into effect on the 15th, no work at all could be done safely between 9am and 3pm.

      "body": "<p>The year\u2019s biggest disappointment has arrived. It emerges with weirdly grownup self-importance from the tulip fever of festival awards season as an upscale spin on an established pop culture brand. Last year we had Luca Guadagnino\u2019s solemn version of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/01/suspiria-review-luca-guadagninos-horror-remake-has-sex-and-style-but-fails-to-bewitch\" title=\"\">Suspiria</a>, and now it\u2019s Joker, from director and co-writer <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0680846/\" title=\"\">Todd Phillips</a>: a new origin myth for Batman\u2019s most famous supervillain opponent.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/joaquin-phoenix\" title=\"\">Joaquin Phoenix</a> plays Arthur Fleck, a pathetic loser and loner in Gotham City, some time in the early 1980s. Arthur is a former inpatient at a psychiatric facility but is now allowed to live with his elderly mother, Penny (Frances Conroy), in her scuzzy apartment. Poor Arthur has a neurological condition that means he is liable to break into screeching laughter at inopportune moments. He has a crush on his single-mom neighbour Sophie (Zazie Beetz) and pines to be a comedian, hero-worshipping cheesy TV host Murray Franklin (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/robertdeniro\" title=\"\">Robert De Niro</a>). But he can only get a job as a clown in grinning makeup and floppy-toed shoes twirling an advertising banner outside a store, where he is bullied and beaten up by young thugs passing by. One day, after the humiliation and despair become too much to bear, Arthur gets hold of a gun and discovers that his talent is not for comedy but violence.</p> <p>Phillips has already directed a film featuring a brilliant unfunny-funny figure with learning difficulties: Alan in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jun/12/film-review-the-hangover\" title=\"\">The Hangover</a>, played by Zach Galifianakis, that strange dysfunctional figure who mispronounces the noun \u201cretard\u201d. I wonder what Joker would be like with Galifianakis in the lead. Well, the casting of Phoenix indicates more clearly how sexy Joker is supposed to be.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAGVQLHvwOY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zAGVQLHvwOY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>There is great production design by Mark Friedberg, some tremendous period cityscape images by cinematographer Lawrence Sher, and a strong performance by Phoenix, though not his best \u2013 it is not as good as his appearance in Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/sep/02/the-master-review\" title=\"\">The Master</a>. The film holds your attention up until Joker\u2019s terrible revenge bloodbath on the subway early on, perhaps intended to echo the notorious <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_New_York_City_Subway_shooting\">Bernhard Goetz shooting</a> of 1984 \u2013 although Phillips prudently makes it a non-racist attack. After this, the film loses your interest, with tedious and forced material about Joker\u2019s supposed triggering of an anti-capitalist, anti-rich movement with protesters dressing as clowns. Joker\u2019s own criminal and serial-killer career bafflingly fizzles.</p> <p>The film makes reference to movies from around the drama\u2019s era, such as the <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071402/\" title=\"\">Death Wish</a> films, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/17/french-connection-crime\" title=\"\">The French Connection</a> and maybe even <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/\" title=\"\">Star Wars</a>, but it\u2019s more obviously a laborious and pointless homage to the Scorsese/De Niro classic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-king-of-comedy\" title=\"\">The King of Comedy</a> with a bit of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/09/taxi-driver-review-scorseses-sleaze-is-still-the-bees-knees\" title=\"\">Taxi Driver</a>, which means that at various moments it\u2019s a bit like The King of Comedy and Taxi Driver, only not as good.</p> <p>The connection is signalled by the casting of De Niro himself, but it is nonetheless unearned and pedantic, especially compared to Lynne Ramsey\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/may/26/you-were-never-really-here-review-joaquin-phoenix-lynne-ramsay-cannes-2017\" title=\"\">You Were Never Really Here</a>, also starring Phoenix as a loner living with his mom, which managed the connection more adroitly.</p> <p>The whole idea of the malign clown should be very relevant. We live in an era of trolling, incels and internet bullying. (The grisly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/21/milo-yiannopoulos-rise-and-fall-shallow-actor-bad-guy-hate-speech\" title=\"\">Milo Yiannopoulos</a> described himself as a \u201csupervillain\u201d on his now cancelled Twitter bio.) There\u2019s nothing wrong and everything right with engaging with all of this \u2013 and the \u201ccopycat\u201d row is a red herring. But, perhaps because online aggression is difficult to dramatise, Phillips understandably wanted his film to be set in a pre-web age. Yet he cheats an anachronistic quasi-YouTube moment into his story when a video of Arthur\u2019s catastrophic attempt at standup comedy somehow emerges. (I wonder if there wasn\u2019t an earlier, contemporary-set draft of the script.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1db6f4f3401dfc1b594757ca6428c0a022f19bf5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1db6f4f3401dfc1b594757ca6428c0a022f19bf5/332_0_2998_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A bit of Taxi Driver, only not as good \u2026 Joker.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Taxi Driver, only not as good \u2026 Joker.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Warner Bros</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This Joker\u2019s genesis is determinedly mature and uncartoony, compared to, say, Jack Nicholson\u2019s low-level crook Jack Napier falling into a chemical vat in <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096895/\" title=\"\">Tim Burton\u2019s Batman</a>, turning him into the Joker with white skin, green hair and a rictus grin.

But at some stage the comic-book world of supervillaindom has to be entered, and Ledger was more powerful because he wasn\u2019t weighed down with all this realist detail and overblown ironic noir grandeur, and he wasn\u2019t forced to carry an entire story on his own. This Joker has just one act in him: the first act. The film somehow manages to be desperately serious and very shallow.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The year\u2019s biggest disappointment has arrived. It emerges with weirdly grownup self-importance from the tulip fever of festival awards season as an upscale spin on an established pop culture brand. Last year we had Luca Guadagnino\u2019s solemn version of Suspiria, and now it\u2019s Joker, from director and co-writer Todd Phillips: a new origin myth for Batman\u2019s most famous supervillain opponent. Joaquin Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck, a pathetic loser and loner in Gotham City, some time in the early 1980s. Arthur is a former inpatient at a psychiatric facility but is now allowed to live with his elderly mother, Penny (Frances Conroy), in her scuzzy apartment. Poor Arthur has a neurological condition that means he is liable to break into screeching laughter at inopportune moments. He has a crush on his single-mom neighbour Sophie (Zazie Beetz) and pines to be a comedian, hero-worshipping cheesy TV host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro). But he can only get a job as a clown in grinning makeup and floppy-toed shoes twirling an advertising banner outside a store, where he is bullied and beaten up by young thugs passing by. One day, after the humiliation and despair become too much to bear, Arthur gets hold of a gun and discovers that his talent is not for comedy but violence. Phillips has already directed a film featuring a brilliant unfunny-funny figure with learning difficulties: Alan in The Hangover, played by Zach Galifianakis, that strange dysfunctional figure who mispronounces the noun \u201cretard\u201d. I wonder what Joker would be like with Galifianakis in the lead. Well, the casting of Phoenix indicates more clearly how sexy Joker is supposed to be. There is great production design by Mark Friedberg, some tremendous period cityscape images by cinematographer Lawrence Sher, and a strong performance by Phoenix, though not his best \u2013 it is not as good as his appearance in Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s The Master. The film holds your attention up until Joker\u2019s terrible revenge bloodbath on the subway early on, perhaps intended to echo the notorious Bernhard Goetz shooting of 1984 \u2013 although Phillips prudently makes it a non-racist attack. After this, the film loses your interest, with tedious and forced material about Joker\u2019s supposed triggering of an anti-capitalist, anti-rich movement with protesters dressing as clowns. Joker\u2019s own criminal and serial-killer career bafflingly fizzles. The film makes reference to movies from around the drama\u2019s era, such as the Death Wish films, The French Connection and maybe even Star Wars, but it\u2019s more obviously a laborious and pointless homage to the Scorsese/De Niro classic The King of Comedy with a bit of Taxi Driver, which means that at various moments it\u2019s a bit like The King of Comedy and Taxi Driver, only not as good. The connection is signalled by the casting of De Niro himself, but it is nonetheless unearned and pedantic, especially compared to Lynne Ramsey\u2019s You Were Never Really Here, also starring Phoenix as a loner living with his mom, which managed the connection more adroitly. The whole idea of the malign clown should be very relevant. We live in an era of trolling, incels and internet bullying. (The grisly Milo Yiannopoulos described himself as a \u201csupervillain\u201d on his now cancelled Twitter bio.) There\u2019s nothing wrong and everything right with engaging with all of this \u2013 and the \u201ccopycat\u201d row is a red herring. But, perhaps because online aggression is difficult to dramatise, Phillips understandably wanted his film to be set in a pre-web age. Yet he cheats an anachronistic quasi-YouTube moment into his story when a video of Arthur\u2019s catastrophic attempt at standup comedy somehow emerges. (I wonder if there wasn\u2019t an earlier, contemporary-set draft of the script.) This Joker\u2019s genesis is determinedly mature and uncartoony, compared to, say, Jack Nicholson\u2019s low-level crook Jack Napier falling into a chemical vat in Tim Burton\u2019s Batman, turning him into the Joker with white skin, green hair and a rictus grin. (The look of DC\u2019s Joker was originally inspired by Conrad Veidt in the 1928 silent classic The Man Who Laughs, a man whose face was disfigured into a grin by his father\u2019s political enemies.) There is no reason why Phoenix\u2019s elaborately backstoried Joker shouldn\u2019t be as powerful as Heath Ledger\u2019s mysterious, motiveless, originless Joker in The Dark Knight. But at some stage the comic-book world of supervillaindom has to be entered, and Ledger was more powerful because he wasn\u2019t weighed down with all this realist detail and overblown ironic noir grandeur, and he wasn\u2019t forced to carry an entire story on his own. This Joker has just one act in him: the first act. The film somehow manages to be desperately serious and very shallow.",

For Dragset, Prada Marfa had become a lens to view the passage of time, \u201cchanges in how we use technology to perceive a site, or an experience\u201d, he said, particularly in terms of selfie culture. \u201cNothing is worth anything unless you have your face in front of it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e62debf7de76ebec2452b2e00813363695443ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e62debf7de76ebec2452b2e00813363695443ad/0_0_6240_4160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Miuccia Prada donated shoes and purses to the artwork.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Miuccia Prada donated shoes and purses to the artwork.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katie Reese</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Following 14 years of estrangement, the artists returned to Prada Marfa on the occasion of their first US survey, <a href=\"https://www.nashersculpturecenter.org/art/exhibitions/exhibition/id/662?elmgreen--dragset-sculptures\">Elmgreen &amp; Dragset: Sculptures</a>, at the Nasher Sculpture Center in Dallas. The exhibition surveys a partnership that has, since 1995, produced social satire in the form of high-production, prefabricated sculpture and installation.</p> <p>Prada Marfa was a response to the high-priced commercialism that was quietly gentrifying cities amid the 90s neoliberal economic boom. The artists staged its precursor in New York in 2001, when, as expensive designer shops priced art dealers out of SoHo, they mounted an exhibition with the words \u201cOPENING SOON, PRADA\u201d printed on a Chelsea gallery\u2019s storefront window. (With little else on view, collectors believed the gallery had really closed, and the owner was not amused.)</p> <p>\u201cThis architectural entity of a luxury boutique had suddenly become so present in our culture, and we were all starting to get used to it,\u201d Elmgreen said. Putting a luxury boutique in the desert, they thought, would render this invisible force visible. With the help of two commissioning art organizations, Art Production Fund and Ballroom Marfa, the artists found a rancher based in the 200-person town of Valentine, Texas, who was willing to donate a parcel of land to the project.

The monumental art collections of Marfa, and by extension Prada Marfa, suddenly became booming mainstream destinations. In 2013, when the Texas department of transportation threatened Prada Marfa\u2019s removal after deeming it a piece of illegal roadside advertising, the sculpture won its right to stay after Ballroom Marfa granted it museum status. Vandalism continued, in the form of stuffed drainpipes, bullet holes, cigarette burns in the awnings; in one high-profile 2014 incident, an Austin-based <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/art-world/prada-marfa-vandal-9271977-arrested-unmasked-6648\">artist was arrested</a> for using the site for his own guerrilla installation, plastering it with blue paint and ads for Toms shoes.</p> <p>Residents of Valentine have offered mixed reviews: \u201cIt was strange at first, but it\u2019s been here so long we\u2019ve gotten used to it,\u201d said Letty, 48, a local librarian who declined to give her last name.

Couples attach love locks to the links of its surrounding fence; unauthorized companies mass-produce road signs to Prada Marfa as bedroom decor. It inspired the tiny, non-functioning roadside attraction <a href=\"https://texashillcountry.com/smallest-target-store-marathon-texas/\">Target Marathon</a> outside Marathon, Texas. And during a recent road-trip episode of The Simpsons, Homer cemented Prada Marfa\u2019s place in popular culture by urinating on it.</p> <p>After their opening in Dallas, Elmgreen &amp; Dragset took the one-hour flight to Midland, then boarded a small bus with a few VIP museum patrons. As they went west on Highway 90, a road prone to mirages, Prada Marfa first appeared as a small blip in the distance. The artists stood with excitement before the bus came to a full stop. There across the road was their sculpture, framed by the surreal light and low-slung clouds of the desert sky. The stucco walls had been freshly painted, and the interior carpet freshly vacuumed of dead bugs. For both artists, it was a poignant moment.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost like being a parent who experienced children growing up and going a direction they never intended,\u201d Elmgreen said.</p> <p>\u201cAfter all these years, you come out here and the landscape, the collection, the way the bags are standing, is exactly the same,\u201d Dragset said. \u201cNothing is ever like that.\u201d<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "When the Scandinavian artists Michael Elmgreen and Ingar Dragset erected Prada Marfa, a sculptural, non-functioning replica of a luxury Prada boutique, on the edge of a lonely west Texas highway, they imagined that it would end up like the remote Land Art of the 60s and 70s. In the absence of modern social media, it would quietly erode into the landscape before anyone ever really got a chance to see it. \u201cIt would exist more as documentation and a rumor,\u201d Dragset recalled, \u201cand at some point just disappear.\u201d But rather than fade away, Prada Marfa defied the artists\u2019 expectations, mutating into a cultural sensation over the years. It appeared on The Simpsons and in Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Instagram feed, having attracted countless other social media influencers. It has weathered the elements, a legal threat and repeated acts of vandalism. Recently, when the Berlin-based artists returned to the site for the first time in nearly 15 years, they found a sculpture that had taken on a life of its own. \u201cIt became a symbol beyond our expectations, or individual ideas, in good ways and bad,\u201d said Elmgreen during the recent visit, bringing to light the friction between the public and public art, artistic intention and outcome. For Dragset, Prada Marfa had become a lens to view the passage of time, \u201cchanges in how we use technology to perceive a site, or an experience\u201d, he said, particularly in terms of selfie culture. \u201cNothing is worth anything unless you have your face in front of it.\u201d Following 14 years of estrangement, the artists returned to Prada Marfa on the occasion of their first US survey, Elmgreen &amp; Dragset: Sculptures, at the Nasher Sculpture Center in Dallas. The exhibition surveys a partnership that has, since 1995, produced social satire in the form of high-production, prefabricated sculpture and installation. Prada Marfa was a response to the high-priced commercialism that was quietly gentrifying cities amid the 90s neoliberal economic boom. The artists staged its precursor in New York in 2001, when, as expensive designer shops priced art dealers out of SoHo, they mounted an exhibition with the words \u201cOPENING SOON, PRADA\u201d printed on a Chelsea gallery\u2019s storefront window. (With little else on view, collectors believed the gallery had really closed, and the owner was not amused.) \u201cThis architectural entity of a luxury boutique had suddenly become so present in our culture, and we were all starting to get used to it,\u201d Elmgreen said. Putting a luxury boutique in the desert, they thought, would render this invisible force visible. With the help of two commissioning art organizations, Art Production Fund and Ballroom Marfa, the artists found a rancher based in the 200-person town of Valentine, Texas, who was willing to donate a parcel of land to the project. They named it after the nearby town of Marfa, known in the art world for being the onetime home of the late minimalist legend Donald Judd. The venue was perfect, according to Elmgreen, since \u201cluxury brands that were using minimalism to make their interiors look more tasteful and intellectual were indebted to Judd\u2019s work\u201d. On 1 October 2005, Elmgreen &amp; Dragset inaugurated a 15ft-wide white building made of adobe brick, designed with the help of the architects Ronald Rael and Virginia San Fratello. Like a real boutique, it featured the Prada logos on two big black signs and two awnings on the facade, and, visible through the glass storefront, rows of shoes sat single-file on illuminated shelves. (Despite the work\u2019s critique of her brand, a delighted Miuccia Prada donated shoes and purses from her autumn/winter 2005 collection.) Vandals struck almost immediately. Within days, they spray-painted the side of the building and ripped out its non-functioning door, making off with all its merchandise: several very expensive purses and more than a dozen worthless, right-foot-only shoes. \u201cAll parties realized that if the structure were allowed to fully decay, it would become both a hazard and an eyesore,\u201d says Ballroom Marfa\u2019s website, and so they got new shoes, painted over the graffiti, and replaced the glass storefront with shatterproof acrylic. To this day, contrary to the artist\u2019s original intent, Ballroom Marfa and Art Production Fund continue to finance its maintenance, \u201cout of respect to the residents of Valentine\u201d. (In a county where the median income sits at $46,534 and public schools lack proper funding, the organizations declined to share how much they spend on the sculpture\u2019s maintenance.)

Installed outside museum walls, public art is not only exposed to the elements but also to \u201can audience that didn\u2019t ask for an art experience\u201d, Elmgreen said. \u201cWhen people interact with [public art], even vandalism can be seen as a positive \u2013 it\u2019s a sign of people feeling that they have a say in public space.\u201d The last 14 years unfolded with a series of unforeseeable events, beginning with the advent of social media and Airbnb. The monumental art collections of Marfa, and by extension Prada Marfa, suddenly became booming mainstream destinations. In 2013, when the Texas department of transportation threatened Prada Marfa\u2019s removal after deeming it a piece of illegal roadside advertising, the sculpture won its right to stay after Ballroom Marfa granted it museum status. Vandalism continued, in the form of stuffed drainpipes, bullet holes, cigarette burns in the awnings; in one high-profile 2014 incident, an Austin-based artist was arrested for using the site for his own guerrilla installation, plastering it with blue paint and ads for Toms shoes. Residents of Valentine have offered mixed reviews: \u201cIt was strange at first, but it\u2019s been here so long we\u2019ve gotten used to it,\u201d said Letty, 48, a local librarian who declined to give her last name. Her fellow resident Bob Carr, age 74, called it \u201ca waste of money\u201d. Neither has ever taken a photo there. But despite its detractors, public affection for Prada Marfa is undeniable. Couples attach love locks to the links of its surrounding fence; unauthorized companies mass-produce road signs to Prada Marfa as bedroom decor. It inspired the tiny, non-functioning roadside attraction Target Marathon outside Marathon, Texas. And during a recent road-trip episode of The Simpsons, Homer cemented Prada Marfa\u2019s place in popular culture by urinating on it. After their opening in Dallas, Elmgreen &amp; Dragset took the one-hour flight to Midland, then boarded a small bus with a few VIP museum patrons. As they went west on Highway 90, a road prone to mirages, Prada Marfa first appeared as a small blip in the distance. The artists stood with excitement before the bus came to a full stop. There across the road was their sculpture, framed by the surreal light and low-slung clouds of the desert sky. The stucco walls had been freshly painted, and the interior carpet freshly vacuumed of dead bugs. For both artists, it was a poignant moment. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like being a parent who experienced children growing up and going a direction they never intended,\u201d Elmgreen said. \u201cAfter all these years, you come out here and the landscape, the collection, the way the bags are standing, is exactly the same,\u201d Dragset said. \u201cNothing is ever like that.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Why are we always pointing to Instagram as the cause of mental illness in our teenagers? It\u2019s frustrating that abusive relationships, and the trauma they cause, are rarely mentioned in discussions about the prevalence of mental health problems in young people. <a href=\"https://www.endviolenceagainstwomen.org.uk/about/data-on-violence-against-women-and-girls/\" title=\"\">Research</a> by Women\u2019s Aid and Cosmopolitan has found that a third of teenage girls have been in an abusive relationship. And, if that isn\u2019t shocking enough, when the remaining two-thirds were asked further questions, it emerged that 64% of them had, in fact, experienced abusive behaviour \u2013 they just didn\u2019t realise it was abuse.</p> <p>Domestic abuse is normally associated with women cowering on the floor, as a violent husband waits to strike, or mothers covering up their black eyes with concealer before the school run. On the same day that the domestic abuse bill received its second reading in parliament, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/oct/02/action-needed-to-tackle-domestic-abuse-of-over-60s-says-age-uk\" title=\"\">Age UK called for action to tackle domestic abuse of over-60s</a>, whose needs it says are often overlooked by the law, policy and practice. The needs of teenagers in the heady throes of first love who are in emotionally abusive relationships also need to be recognised.</p> <p>Common themes of such relationships include (though are not limited to) excessive jealousy, repeated criticism and sexual coercion. If your boyfriend or girlfriend is checking your phone, constantly asking to know your whereabouts, getting upset when you spend time away, turning up unannounced to surprise you, these are all examples of coercive control.

      "bodyText": "Why are we always pointing to Instagram as the cause of mental illness in our teenagers? It\u2019s frustrating that abusive relationships, and the trauma they cause, are rarely mentioned in discussions about the prevalence of mental health problems in young people. Research by Women\u2019s Aid and Cosmopolitan has found that a third of teenage girls have been in an abusive relationship. And, if that isn\u2019t shocking enough, when the remaining two-thirds were asked further questions, it emerged that 64% of them had, in fact, experienced abusive behaviour \u2013 they just didn\u2019t realise it was abuse. Domestic abuse is normally associated with women cowering on the floor, as a violent husband waits to strike, or mothers covering up their black eyes with concealer before the school run. On the same day that the domestic abuse bill received its second reading in parliament, Age UK called for action to tackle domestic abuse of over-60s, whose needs it says are often overlooked by the law, policy and practice. The needs of teenagers in the heady throes of first love who are in emotionally abusive relationships also need to be recognised. Common themes of such relationships include (though are not limited to) excessive jealousy, repeated criticism and sexual coercion. If your boyfriend or girlfriend is checking your phone, constantly asking to know your whereabouts, getting upset when you spend time away, turning up unannounced to surprise you, these are all examples of coercive control. If they never apologise in an argument and make everything your fault, tell you what you can and can\u2019t wear, undermine you and/or publicly humiliate you under the guise of a \u201cjoke\u201d, these again are common instances of controlling behaviour. Ditto, if they have a Jekyll/Hyde personality, make you feel like you are walking on eggshells even when things are seemingly going well, and threaten to hurt themselves if you leave. When it comes to sexual coercion and rape, examples include making you feel pressured to perform sexual acts you\u2019re uncomfortable with, such as sending nude photos, having sex before you\u2019re ready, being pressured to re-enact extreme sex from porn films or being told you don\u2019t love them if you say no. Often the victim in an abusive relationship can never quite put their finger on one thing, but the overwhelming feeling is of a general unease, feeling unsafe, defective, wrong, scared and as if you are going crazy. It\u2019s your \u201cyourselfness\u201d that\u2019s being consistently undermined, controlled and attacked by the person who claims to love you. \u201cBut he never hit me,\u201d is the phrase that comes up repeatedly when talking to teenage victims of emotionally abusive relationships. Another is: \u201cIt\u2019s my fault. I\u2019m so crazy.

They were for members of the public and their elected representatives.\u201d</p> <p>But the campaign group BackTo60, which bought the claim on behalf of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jun/05/women-born-in-1950s-take-fight-against-rising-pension-age-to-court\">women affected by the pension changes</a> \u2013 many of whom who only found out their pension age had increased when they applied to draw it, or shortly before \u2013 said they would appeal against the decision.</p> <p>Joanne Welch from the group said: \u201cThey can\u2019t knock us back.

There\u2019s a general election coming up. You need our votes and we are holding you to that undertaking.\u201d</p> <p>Marcia Willis Stewart of Birnberg Peirce, which represented the claimants, said: \u201cWe are deeply disappointed by this decision.\u201d She added that the aim of the \u201carduous legal process\u201d was \u201cto rectify a substantial and far-reaching injustice\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cSadly, today that injustice remains,\u201d she said. \u201cThe struggling on behalf of those beleaguered women, whose stories saddened the judges but for whom this judgment provided no relief, will continue.\u201d</p> <p>The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, tweeted: \u201cDisappointed to hear about today\u2019s decision.

      "bodyText": "Almost 4 million women born in the 1950s will not be compensated for the money they lost when the pension age was raised from 60 to 66, the high court has decided. Two claimants took the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to court, arguing that raising their pension age \u201cunlawfully discriminated against them on the grounds of age, sex, and age and sex combined\u201d. Lord Justice Irwin and Mrs Justice Whipple said in their judgment on Thursday that they were saddened by the claimants\u2019 stories but that the court\u2019s role was limited. In a judgment dismissing the claim on all grounds, including age discrimination, sex discrimination and lack of notice, they said: \u201cThe wider issues raised by the claimants about whether the choices were right or wrong, or good or bad, were not for the court. They were for members of the public and their elected representatives.\u201d But the campaign group BackTo60, which bought the claim on behalf of women affected by the pension changes \u2013 many of whom who only found out their pension age had increased when they applied to draw it, or shortly before \u2013 said they would appeal against the decision. Joanne Welch from the group said: \u201cThey can\u2019t knock us back. We\u2019ve got a fierce and powerful armoury behind us. As well as the 3.8 million women affected, we have the support of 215 MPs, Unite, Unison, TUC and others. \u201cIf we were a political party, we would be the third biggest, so come on Boris Johnson: you pledged during the Tory leadership campaign that you would look at this issue with fresh vigour. There\u2019s a general election coming up. You need our votes and we are holding you to that undertaking.\u201d Marcia Willis Stewart of Birnberg Peirce, which represented the claimants, said: \u201cWe are deeply disappointed by this decision.\u201d She added that the aim of the \u201carduous legal process\u201d was \u201cto rectify a substantial and far-reaching injustice\u201d. \u201cSadly, today that injustice remains,\u201d she said. \u201cThe struggling on behalf of those beleaguered women, whose stories saddened the judges but for whom this judgment provided no relief, will continue.\u201d The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, tweeted: \u201cDisappointed to hear about today\u2019s decision. I will continue to support campaign in their fight against pension inequality.\u201d The Green party MP, Caroline Lucas tweeted: \u201cDeeply disappointing that the courageous and unjustly treated women have lost their judicial review in the high court. The gross pensions injustice for 1950s women remains \u2013 I will continue to support their fight.\u201d The Unison general secretary, Dave Prentis, called the judgment \u201cperverse\u201d.

The two judges had to consider both UK and EU law, and the UK\u2019s ratification by Margaret Thatcher of the UN convention for the elimination of discrimination against women (CEDAW), which specifies that women who have been discriminated against must be fully compensated. Women in their 50s and 60s were hit by the government\u2019s decision under the 1995 Pensions Act to increase the female state pension age from 60 to 65. The change was to be phased in between 2010 and 2020. The coalition government of 2010 accelerated the timetable. The 2011 Pensions Act brought the new qualifying age of 65 for women forward to 2018. The qualifying age for both men and women will be raised to 66 by October 2020. BackTo60 argued that women were not given time to adjust to the new retirement age and also that the changes in 2011 and 1995 had not been clearly communicated.

      "bodyText": "For the past four years, the imposing S\u00e3o Bento palace, seat of Portugal\u2019s parliament, has been the scene of one of the more unlikely feats of European governance. While populist parties have erupted at both ends of the political spectrum elsewhere across the continent, Portugal has proved an enduring, if improbable, beacon of social democracy. Although the rightwing Portugal Ahead coalition, led by pro-austerity then prime minister Pedro Passos Coelho, took the most votes in the October 2015 general election, its minority government lasted a mere 11 days. It was toppled by the socialist leader, Ant\u00f3nio Costa, thanks to a promise to \u201cturn the page on austerity\u201d and a jury-rigged, non-coalition alliance with the far-left. Since then, Costa and his backers in the Left Bloc and Communist parties have confounded expectations by holding together their unprecedented deal, known as the geringon\u00e7a \u2013 or improvised solution. They have also brought political and economic stability to a country that received a \u20ac78bn bailout from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund during the financial crisis eight years ago. As Portugal prepares to vote in Sunday\u2019s general election, Costa is hoping that his track record will win him another term in office. The polls suggest his Socialist party (PS) will win the election but fall short of an absolute majority in parliament. Speaking in Coimbra this week, Costa said his party had \u201ctorn down the wall of incommunicability\u201d between the Portuguese left and paved the way for the country\u2019s recovery. Without the PS government, he added, Portugal would not have managed to \u201cturn the page on austerity, regain international credibility, maintain investor confidence, reduce inequalities and balance the books\u201d. Costa has argued that a \u201cstrong PS\u201d is needed to keep things on track and has warned that a surge in support for the Left Bloc could lead to the kind of impasse seen in Spain, where the socialist party\u2019s inability to reach a deal with the far-left, anti-austerity Unidas Podemos has triggered the country\u2019s fourth election in as many years. Andr\u00e9 Azevedo Alves, a political scientist at the Catholic University of Portugal and St Mary\u2019s University, London, said Costa\u2019s main domestic achievement has been to deliver four years of relatively stable government. \u201cMost people didn\u2019t think the government would last more than one or two years,\u201d he said. \u201cPolitical stability is one of the big factors that Costa and the Socialists have on their side. There was also a very high level of scepticism about a socialist government, with parliamentary support from the far left, being able to comply with the public finance objectives established by the European Union.\u201d Costa\u2019s other successes include raising the minimum wage to \u20ac600 a month, reversing civil service cuts and reducing unemployment. Externally, added Azevedo Alves, Costa has been able to keep the traditional social democratic party as the main party \u201cat a time when the traditional centre-left parties are in deep trouble \u2013 or, in some places, have almost disappeared\u201d. Despite all the talk of the \u201cPortuguese miracle\u201d, however, Costa\u2019s administration has hardly been immune to criticism, mistakes, scandal or corruption. Marina Costa Lobo, a political scientist at the University of Lisbon, pointed out that the country\u2019s much-vaunted economic stability has come at a price: \u201c[Costa\u2019s] achievements on anti-austerity were achieved through pragmatism, which meant that public investment has decreased dramatically, with resulting difficulties in key areas of public policy like health, transport and others.\u201d Underfunding of public services such as education and healthcare has provoked strikes and anger, while the government\u2019s handling of the 2017 forest fires that killed more than 100 people was bitterly criticised and led to the resignation of the interior minister. Meanwhile, Costa\u2019s former defence minister, Jos\u00e9 Azeredo Lopes, is to be tried over his alleged role in a suspected cover-up of a weapons theft at a military base two years ago. Perhaps most damaging of all though, are the corruption charges faced by Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates, Portugal\u2019s socialist prime minister from 2005 to 2011. He is accused of pocketing \u20ac34m through top-level corruption and has been charged with corruption in public office, money laundering, forgery and tax fraud. S\u00f3crates has denied any wrongdoing, but corruption remains an issue for many Portuguese people. A recent survey by the European Council on Foreign Relations found that 64% of those polled see it as a significant problem for Portugal. \u201cLarge segments of the electorate would regard Costa as skilled and politically able but perhaps not necessarily the most trustworthy leader,\u201d said Azevedo Alves. \u201cThat explains the socialists\u2019 substantial lead in the polls but their lack of a clear majority in parliament.\u201d If, as expected, a majority eludes the socialists, they could reactivate the geringon\u00e7a, again relying on the support of the Left Bloc and Communist party from outside government. But if the PS finds itself closer to a majority than had been anticipated, it could instead turn to the small but growing green People-Animals-Nature (PAN) party, which is less ideologically fixed than the far-left groups. Whatever happens, though, and despite the protests and scandals, Costa and his allies have shown that the geringon\u00e7a has evolved from being a punchline to a resilient and effective political machine. \u201cIt has worked well; it has produced political stability,\u201d said Costa Lobo. \u201cEconomics trumps policy overall and ensures the PS will win.\u201d Azevedo Alves also sees a definite shift in the public mood. \u201cIn 2015, people were thinking we\u2019ll be bankrupt again a year from now,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there\u2019s an idea within a large sector of the electorate that things haven\u2019t been wonderful but they have gone pretty well.

      "body": "<p>For too long, poetry has had a reputation for being overly difficult, elitist and obscure. Yet it seems to me that nothing could be further from the truth. The poets of the last 100 years have been motivated by an urgent desire to communicate new ideas, and to recover ancient wisdom lost in the hubbub of modernity. As old orthodoxies faded, they found ways to make sense of the noise of time, transforming it into a new and unexpected music. Here are five landmark poems, including one from this year, that tell us something about their age.</p> <p><strong>Siegfried Sassoon,</strong><a href=\"https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/everyone-sang/\" title=\"\"><strong> \u2018Everyone Sang\u2019</strong></a><strong> (1919) </strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b7d43d685846f5a70ee96a190aa269571670d501\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7d43d685846f5a70ee96a190aa269571670d501/0_20_1835_2293/800.jpg\" alt=\"Siegfried Sassoon\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Though the term was not coined until the 1960s, first world war poet Siegfried Sassoon always felt able to \u201cspeak truth to power\u201d, lambasting incompetent generals and corrupt politicians as well as an ignorant public back home, sometimes at great risk to himself. Yet he also produced the first great peace poem of the age, tempering powerful satire with tenderness and a sense of gratitude for community. \u201cEveryone Sang\u201d begins abruptly, as a flash mob does, with an impromptu choir\u2019s improbable synchronicity: \u201cEveryone suddenly burst out singing.\u201d This is an arresting moment, and we might be tempted to charge Sassoon with allowing himself a personal epiphany here, but there is no Romantic ego at the centre of this experience; instead, the speaker is \u201cfilled with such delight / As prisoned birds must find in freedom, / Winging wildly across the white / Orchards and dark-green fields, on \u2013 on \u2013 and out of sight.\u201d The image Sassoon chooses to convey that sudden sense of freedom is, like the singing, a communal one: not a single bird that rises, symbolically, into a blue sky, but an entire flock that flies as real birds would. As they do so, \u201ceveryone\u201d sings. But who is this everyone? A group of soldiers celebrating the announcement of the Armistice? An entire village back home, or even England itself, raising its voice in hope, now that the \u201chorror of years\u201d is drifting away? In one sense, it does not matter; in another it is all these things, as we come to see that community, like peace, cannot be constructed, or imposed, but can only emerge spontaneously from the dailiness of life: \u2018Everyone\u2019s voice was suddenly lifted; / And beauty came like the setting sun.\u2019 That dailiness is what we mean by peace \u2013 and now that the horrors are over, Sassoon creates a lasting reminder of how much that peace depends on mutual understanding.</p> <p><strong>Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca, </strong><a href=\"https://allpoetry.com/poem/8512729-Farewell-by-Federico-Garcia-Lorca\" title=\"\"><strong>\u2018Farewell\u2019</strong></a><strong> (1924)</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"58dedc8d1c66df3ae86c0faf09192322b6f9588f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/58dedc8d1c66df3ae86c0faf09192322b6f9588f/763_1076_932_1165/800.jpg\" alt=\"Frederico Garc\u00eda Lorca\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In Spain, the humanist poem \u2013 in which death is freely accepted as a part of the natural cycle \u2013 not only added to a great philosophical tradition, it also helped to undermine the tentacular influence of the Catholic church, an institution that, before the 1930s Republic, did so much to maintain the power of the feudal landowners and suppress working people. When Lorca writes \u201cIf I die / leave the balcony open\u2026\u201d he is affirming the here and now, the everyday, against the church\u2019s myth of heaven. He continues: \u201cThe boy is eating oranges / (From my balcony I see him) / The reaper is cutting the wheat / (From my balcony I hear him)\u201d before ending, with a simple finality, on a repetition of the first two lines.</p> <p>\u201cFarewell\u201d (\u201cDespedida\u201d in Spanish) is not a work that demands much analysis. True, we note the passing reference to the reaper (a reference too playful to seem grim), but the main point, revealed both in the content and in the economy of form is that, while sidestepping morbidity or self-abnegation, the poem conveys a tranquil awareness that, in the larger scheme of things, the continuing adventure of life itself transcends any one individual, even as it celebrates, by implication, that individual\u2019s most commonplace and fleeting sensations.</p> <p><strong>Marianne Moore, </strong><a href=\"https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/the-steeple-jack/\" title=\"\"><strong>\u2018The Steeple-Jack\u2019</strong></a><strong> (1932)</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"1d4d91a87690316ed43a70efb5cce12a6ead883b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d4d91a87690316ed43a70efb5cce12a6ead883b/260_453_1384_1730/800.jpg\" alt=\"Marianne Moore\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The real scientific discoveries of the last century (uncertainty, incompleteness, fuzzy logic) presented us with a freedom that, for some, was unwelcome, even unnerving. That the world \u201cout there\u201d was not fixed (and that it was mostly not \u201cout there\u201d at all) left too much to Coleridge\u2019s \u201cshaping spirit of Imagination\u201d; we had wanted certainty, order, progress. For Marianne Moore, however, the need to shape and give order to raw and uncertain data is an occasion, not only of one of modernism\u2019s most formally inventive poems, but of a new philosophical perspective: \u201cYou can see a twenty-five- / pound lobster; and fish nets arranged / to dry. The / whirlwind fife-and-drum of the storm bends the salt / marsh grass, disturbs stars in the sky and the / star on the steeple; it is a privilege to see so / much confusion.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe Steeple-Jack\u201d begins with a panoramic view of a New England whaling town much as D\u00fcrer might have painted it, before sliding into more uncertain, Van Gogh territory, where a storm on the land can \u201cdisturb\u201d the stars in the sky, just as it disturbs the human-made star on the steeple. Yet, because of this very uncertainty, our sense of the power, and necessity, of the poetic imagination, which creates order from confusion moment by moment, is elegantly heightened \u2013 and in the process, Moore sketches out the basis for a fully ecocritical science of belonging.</p> <p><strong>WH Auden, </strong><a href=\"https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/in-memory-of-w-b-yeats-2/\" title=\"\"><strong>\u2018In Memory of WB Yeats\u2019</strong></a><strong> (1939)</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"899e91c0dcfd927dfbc176c2085ac1493fbd6e91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/899e91c0dcfd927dfbc176c2085ac1493fbd6e91/0_107_2048_2559/800.jpg\" alt=\"WH Auden\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The great lesson of Franco\u2019s victory in Spain was that poetry and art, no matter how truthful or how fine, could play no more than an ancillary role in the struggle for justice. Though it is actually an elegy, this witty and compassionate poem is best known for a brief passage, in which Auden famously claims that poetry \u201cmakes nothing happen\u201d, a remark so contentious, and so often taken out of context, that it tends to obscure the poem itself. This is unfortunate, for it is one of Auden\u2019s finest poems, and his argument concerning poetry\u2019s political effectiveness is more complex than many have assumed. To understand it fully, however, we have to examine the relevant passage closely: \u201cFor poetry makes nothing happen: it survives / In the valley of its making where executives / Would never want to tamper, flows on south / From ranches of isolation and the busy griefs, / Raw towns that we believe and die in; it survives, / A way of happening, a mouth.\u201d</p> <p>Making things happen was never poetry\u2019s job (that would be to confuse art with propaganda); instead, each poem exists on its own terms, not just as words on a page, but as a modus vivendi, \u201ca way of happening\u201d. As such, poetry disdains to engage with the executives, taking its own wild course, reframing old questions in new ways, redrawing the maps the better to reflect the terrain, qualifying reductive logic with intuited subtleties and, most of all, insisting on quality in a cloddishly quantified world. Poetry makes nothing happen, but, used correctly, it changes everything by refocusing our attention.</p> <p><strong>Joy Harjo, \u2018</strong><a href=\"https://poetswatch.blogspot.com/2018/03/how-to-write-poem-in-time-of-war-by-joy.html\" title=\"\"><strong>How to Write a Poem in a Time of War\u2019</strong></a><strong> (2019)</strong></p> <p>\u201cI have forgotten my name in the language I was born to,\u201d says the Mvskoke Native American poet Joy Harjo, who writes in English because, having been educated in the tongue of those who exterminated her forebears, she has no choice. As a poet, this led her to the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop, academic appointments and, just this year, to poet laureate of the United States (she is the first Native American to hold that post). Nevertheless, the work she has produced has always remained true to that forgotten name. \u201cI have a responsibility to all the sources that I am,\u201d she says: \u201cTo all past and future ancestors, to my home country, to all places that I touch down on and that are myself, to all voices, all women, all of my tribe, all people, all earth, and beyond that to all beginnings and endings.\u201d In this poem, from her 2019 collection, <em>An American Sunrise</em>, she tells the story of a people invaded by a nameless army: \u201cWe tried to pretend war wasn\u2019t going to happen. / Though they began building their houses all around us and / demanding more. / They started teaching our children their god\u2019s story, / A story in which we\u2019d always be slaves.\u201d</p> <p>This could be a painfully succinct summary of what happened to the Mvskoke when white people arrived, but it could also be applied to any colonised culture. What Harjo sets up in opposition to this war, however, is a powerful expression of survival, an act of indigenous self-validation. As is so often the case in her work, she emphasises the importance of narrative song and story to this process of reclaiming native presence: \u201cSomeone has to make it out alive, sang a grandfather to his grandson, / His granddaughter, as he blew his most powerful song into the hearts of the children.\u201d</p> <p>Harjo\u2019s pledge to \u201call voices, all women, all of my tribe, all people\u201d reveals the commitment that the project of native survival demands. Yet it also offers a vision for a new manifestation of what the Russian poet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/23/poem-of-the-week-the-admiralty-by-osip-mandelstam-translated-by-yuri-drobyshev-and-carol-rumens\" title=\"\">Osip Mandelstam</a> once called \u201ca world culture\u201d \u2013 and it is cause for hope, for his poetic descendants, when we see an indigenous female poet, who has spoken movingly about the rejection and ridicule she faced at the start of her writing career, finally taking her just place as one of the most significant and powerful voices of our time.</p> <p><em> \u2022 National Poetry Day was this week. </em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-music-of-time-9781781255612.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>The Music of Time: Poetry in the Twentieth Century</em></a><em> by John Burnside is published by Profile.</em></p>",

The / whirlwind fife-and-drum of the storm bends the salt / marsh grass, disturbs stars in the sky and the / star on the steeple; it is a privilege to see so / much confusion.\u201d \u201cThe Steeple-Jack\u201d begins with a panoramic view of a New England whaling town much as D\u00fcrer might have painted it, before sliding into more uncertain, Van Gogh territory, where a storm on the land can \u201cdisturb\u201d the stars in the sky, just as it disturbs the human-made star on the steeple. Yet, because of this very uncertainty, our sense of the power, and necessity, of the poetic imagination, which creates order from confusion moment by moment, is elegantly heightened \u2013 and in the process, Moore sketches out the basis for a fully ecocritical science of belonging. WH Auden, \u2018In Memory of WB Yeats\u2019 (1939) The great lesson of Franco\u2019s victory in Spain was that poetry and art, no matter how truthful or how fine, could play no more than an ancillary role in the struggle for justice. Though it is actually an elegy, this witty and compassionate poem is best known for a brief passage, in which Auden famously claims that poetry \u201cmakes nothing happen\u201d, a remark so contentious, and so often taken out of context, that it tends to obscure the poem itself. This is unfortunate, for it is one of Auden\u2019s finest poems, and his argument concerning poetry\u2019s political effectiveness is more complex than many have assumed. To understand it fully, however, we have to examine the relevant passage closely: \u201cFor poetry makes nothing happen: it survives / In the valley of its making where executives / Would never want to tamper, flows on south / From ranches of isolation and the busy griefs, / Raw towns that we believe and die in; it survives, / A way of happening, a mouth.\u201d Making things happen was never poetry\u2019s job (that would be to confuse art with propaganda); instead, each poem exists on its own terms, not just as words on a page, but as a modus vivendi, \u201ca way of happening\u201d. As such, poetry disdains to engage with the executives, taking its own wild course, reframing old questions in new ways, redrawing the maps the better to reflect the terrain, qualifying reductive logic with intuited subtleties and, most of all, insisting on quality in a cloddishly quantified world. Poetry makes nothing happen, but, used correctly, it changes everything by refocusing our attention. Joy Harjo, \u2018How to Write a Poem in a Time of War\u2019 (2019) \u201cI have forgotten my name in the language I was born to,\u201d says the Mvskoke Native American poet Joy Harjo, who writes in English because, having been educated in the tongue of those who exterminated her forebears, she has no choice. As a poet, this led her to the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop, academic appointments and, just this year, to poet laureate of the United States (she is the first Native American to hold that post). Nevertheless, the work she has produced has always remained true to that forgotten name. \u201cI have a responsibility to all the sources that I am,\u201d she says: \u201cTo all past and future ancestors, to my home country, to all places that I touch down on and that are myself, to all voices, all women, all of my tribe, all people, all earth, and beyond that to all beginnings and endings.\u201d In this poem, from her 2019 collection, An American Sunrise, she tells the story of a people invaded by a nameless army: \u201cWe tried to pretend war wasn\u2019t going to happen. / Though they began building their houses all around us and / demanding more. / They started teaching our children their god\u2019s story, / A story in which we\u2019d always be slaves.\u201d This could be a painfully succinct summary of what happened to the Mvskoke when white people arrived, but it could also be applied to any colonised culture. What Harjo sets up in opposition to this war, however, is a powerful expression of survival, an act of indigenous self-validation. As is so often the case in her work, she emphasises the importance of narrative song and story to this process of reclaiming native presence: \u201cSomeone has to make it out alive, sang a grandfather to his grandson, / His granddaughter, as he blew his most powerful song into the hearts of the children.\u201d Harjo\u2019s pledge to \u201call voices, all women, all of my tribe, all people\u201d reveals the commitment that the project of native survival demands. Yet it also offers a vision for a new manifestation of what the Russian poet Osip Mandelstam once called \u201ca world culture\u201d \u2013 and it is cause for hope, for his poetic descendants, when we see an indigenous female poet, who has spoken movingly about the rejection and ridicule she faced at the start of her writing career, finally taking her just place as one of the most significant and powerful voices of our time. \u2022 National Poetry Day was this week.

With the Maintenance Cooperation Trust Fund, a California-based watchdog organization that supports non-unionized janitors, the SEIU-USWW partnered with the East LA Women\u2019s Center to train janitors as \u201c<em>promotoras</em>\u201d, or community educators, focused on ending sexual harassment and sexual violence in janitorial workplaces. Nearly 100 janitors are currently trained as promotoras, ready to start going into workplaces to conduct trainings with fellow workers.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Only us janitors know exactly where these attacks can happen and who these attacks can come from.

Like myself, a lot of my colleagues and co-workers are also survivors of rape and sexual assault in the workplace,\u201d said Carmen Sanchez, a janitorial worker for nine years. \u201cOnly us janitors know exactly where these attacks can happen and who these attacks can come from. We\u2019re the only ones who know what working alone at night is like, in places that are completely isolated, darkened, and we\u2019re the only ones who know how those conditions make us vulnerable for these kinds of attacks to happen.\u201d</p> <p>Sanchez explained the trainings have helped her heal and move forward as a survivor and she wants the training to be implemented into law so that she can help her co-workers become empowered and heal in a way that is most comfortable for them to do so.</p> <p>In 2016, these workers successfully pushed the passage of a California state bill, assembly bill 1978, that <a href=\"http://www.cda.org/news-events/employers-must-provide-sexual-harassment-prevention-training-to-all-employees-by-jan-1-2020\">mandated </a>all janitorial service contractors register with the state and provide sexual harassment prevention training to all employees by 1 January 2020.

      "bodyText": "Anabella Aguirre has spent 19 years working in the janitorial industry in Los Angeles, California, since she came to the US from Guatemala. While working the night shift, Aguirre was raped by her supervisor and sexually assaulted a year later at a different work site. In the midst of an epidemic of sexual harassment, rape and sexual assault facing nightshift janitors, Aguirre and dozens of other janitors in California are fighting back to enact into law sexual harassment and sexual violence prevention training led by the workers themselves. \u201cI am through what happened,\u201d said Aguirre, who is also now a trained self-defense instructor. \u201cI am not just a survivor and I have the ability to be a teacher for my fellow colleagues, especially as an immigrant and as a woman, these things are part of my empowerment and ability to help others and actually change the culture.\u201d After the release of a 2015 PBS Frontline documentary, Rape On the Night Shift, the Service Employees International Union-United Service Workers West, which represents more than 25,000 janitors throughout California, conducted a survey of union members\u2019 experiences of sexual harassment. Nearly half of the 5,000 workers who responded reported experiencing sexual harassment or sexual assault on the job, and additional 25% witnessed it. A May 2016 report conducted by the Labor Occupational Health Program at University of California-Berkeley, found industry dysfunction in janitorial services contributed to low wages and persistent hazards exposing workers to risks of sexual harassment, rape and sexual assault, and few resources are available or utilized by subcontractor janitorial services to prevent and stop sexual harassment and sexual violence. The report noted that the frequency of sexual harassment, rape and sexual assault of janitors is not well documented, due in large part to underreporting, but surveys that have been conducted demonstrate a widespread problem throughout the industry. Since the SEIU-USWW survey, rank and file union members launched the Ya Basta! campaign. With the Maintenance Cooperation Trust Fund, a California-based watchdog organization that supports non-unionized janitors, the SEIU-USWW partnered with the East LA Women\u2019s Center to train janitors as \u201cpromotoras\u201d, or community educators, focused on ending sexual harassment and sexual violence in janitorial workplaces. Nearly 100 janitors are currently trained as promotoras, ready to start going into workplaces to conduct trainings with fellow workers. \u201cI\u2019m a rape survivor. Like myself, a lot of my colleagues and co-workers are also survivors of rape and sexual assault in the workplace,\u201d said Carmen Sanchez, a janitorial worker for nine years. \u201cOnly us janitors know exactly where these attacks can happen and who these attacks can come from. We\u2019re the only ones who know what working alone at night is like, in places that are completely isolated, darkened, and we\u2019re the only ones who know how those conditions make us vulnerable for these kinds of attacks to happen.\u201d Sanchez explained the trainings have helped her heal and move forward as a survivor and she wants the training to be implemented into law so that she can help her co-workers become empowered and heal in a way that is most comfortable for them to do so. In 2016, these workers successfully pushed the passage of a California state bill, assembly bill 1978, that mandated all janitorial service contractors register with the state and provide sexual harassment prevention training to all employees by 1 January 2020. California janitorial workers have gone on marches and hunger strikes, and led protest actions at California\u2019s capital to advocate for legislative action. Now rank-and-file members are pushing for the California governor, Gavin Newsom, to sign assembly bill 547, the Janitor Survivor Empowerment Act, into law after it passed the state assembly and senate earlier this month. Newsom has until 13 October to sign or veto the bill. The bill would require janitorial employers to provide biennial, in-person sexual violence and harassment prevention training for janitorial workers from a list of qualified organizations and trainers. \u201cThese women were speaking out about abuse and sexual harassment in the workplace long before the #MeToo movement made this front page news,\u201d said California assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez-Fletcher, author of AB 547, said. \u201cWe worked with them in 2016 to pass AB 1978, which increased workplace protections in the janitorial industry. Now, AB 547 is the next step \u2013 and it\u2019s the second year we\u2019ve introduced this bill.\u201d \u201cWe professional janitor women know exactly what people go through on a daily basis because we have lived through it and that makes us the best candidates to conduct these trainings,\u201d said Veronica Lagunas, a janitorial worker for 15 years and bargaining committee member with SEIU-USWW. \u201cWe are human and we are facing these things and fighting because we believe we can change things.

Not everything was gloomy, however \u2013 he had, he noted, \u201ccome to abounde in good plate\u201d, meaning that instead of using more humble pewter, \u201call entertainments\u201d in the Pepys household could now be served entirely on silver plates. More than 350 years later, a rare example of one of Pepys\u2019 silver plates has been discovered, one of just three plates known to survive from his own collection and the only one on display in the UK. Despite being marked with his own coat of arms, the trencher plate has only been recently been identified as belonging to Pepys, according to the Museum of London, where it is now on display in its War, Plague and Fire gallery. It was made in the workshop of Mary King in Foster Lane in 1681, and displays visible knife and fork scratch marks, suggesting it was well used by the diarist and naval administrator. Pepys began his diary in 1660, at the age of 26, and wrote in it for almost a decade, during which he described some of the most momentous events in London\u2019s history, including the coronation of King Charles II, the great plague of 1665 and the Great Fire of London the following year. He went on to become an MP in Norfolk in 1673 and for Harwich in 1679, and died in 1703, at the age of 70. Hazel Forsyth, senior curator of medieval and post-medieval at the Museum of London, said: \u201cThis is a very important object as it is exceptionally rare to be able to identify the maker and the owner of a plate from this period. \u201cThe fact that it belonged to Samuel Pepys, one of the most celebrated figures in literary and English history, makes it even more special.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A huge floating device designed by Dutch scientists to clean up an island of rubbish in the Pacific Ocean that is three times the size of France has successfully picked up plastic from the high seas for the first time. Boyan Slat, the creator of the Ocean Cleanup project, tweeted that the 600 metre-long (2,000ft) free-floating boom had captured and retained debris from what is known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. Alongside a picture of the collected rubbish, which includes a car wheel, Slat wrote: \u201cOur ocean cleanup system is now finally catching plastic, from one-ton ghost nets to tiny microplastics! Also, anyone missing a wheel?\u201d About 600,000 to 800,000 metric tonnes of fishing gear is abandoned or lost at sea each year. Another 8m tonnes of plastic waste flows in from beaches. Ocean currents have brought a vast patch of such detritus together halfway between Hawaii and California, where it is kept in rough formation by an ocean gyre, a whirlpool of currents. It is the largest accumulation of plastic in the world\u2019s oceans. The vast cleaning system is designed to not only collect discarded fishing nets and large visible plastic objects, but also microplastics. The plastic barrier floating on the surface of the sea has a three metre-deep (10ft) screen below it, which is intended to trap some of the 1.8tn pieces of plastic without disturbing the marine life below. The device is fitted with transmitters and sensors so it can communicate its position via satellites to a vessel that will collect the gathered rubbish every few months. Slat told a press conference in Rotterdam that the problem he was seeking to solve was the vast expense that would come with using a trawler to collect plastics. He said: \u201cWe are now catching plastics \u2026 After beginning this journey seven years ago, this first year of testing in the unforgivable environment of the high seas strongly indicates that our vision is attainable and that the beginning of our mission to rid the ocean of plastic garbage, which has accumulated for decades, is within our sights. \u201cWe now have a self-contained system in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch that is using the natural forces of the ocean to passively catch and concentrate plastics \u2026 This now gives us sufficient confidence in the general concept to keep going on this project.\u201d The plastic gathered so far will be brought to shore in December for recycling. The project believes there may be a premium market for items that have been made using plastic reclaimed from the ocean. \u201cI think in a few years\u2019 time when we have the full-scale fleet out there, I think it should be possible to cover the operational cost of the cleanup operation using the plastic harvested,\u201d Slat said. The plan is to now scale up the device and make it more durable so it can retain plastic for up to a year or possibly longer before collection is necessary. During a previous four-month trial the boom broke apart and no plastic was collected. Since then, changes have been made to the design including the addition of a \u201cparachute anchor\u201d to slow down the device\u2019s movement in the ocean, allowing for faster-moving plastic debris to float into the system. The latest trial began in June when the system was launched into the sea from Vancouver. The project was started in 2013 and its design has undergone several major revisions. It is hoped the final design will be able to clean up half of the debris in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. \u2022 This article was amended on 4 October 2019 to clarify system location details.",

Somebody in their recruitment department has thrown three darts at a wall covered in Panini stickers and hit those bearing the mugshots of the RB Leipzig striker Timo Werner, Lyon\u2019s Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and his Barcelona namesake Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 (no relation). Also ready to bid for the Juventus outcast Mario Mandzukic, it\u2019s almost as if United realised their summer transfer policy was a mite ill-conceived, although their January one doesn\u2019t seem any more coherent. United are also interested in bringing the Leicester playmaker James Maddison and Real Sociedad (on loan from Real Madrid) midfielder Martin \u00d8degaard to Old Trafford, in a state of affairs that suggests the club hierarchy are seriously deluded if they think the current shambles they\u2019re presiding over is likely to be a more attractive option than the many other clubs who are bound to be clamouring for the services of both players. Newcastle\u2019s Sean Longstaff seems a far more realistic target, as the club he currently represents is of a few Premier League outfits that is run even more haphazardly than the one giving him the glad eye. Nobody really thinks Tottenham would be dumb enough to sack Mauricio Pochettino after a poor run stretching back only two months, but that hasn\u2019t stopped the newspapers from reassuring us they aren\u2019t about to hand him his P45. Whether or not the Argentinian actually wants to stay at White Hart Lane is another matter altogether and \u2013 oh look, would you believe it? \u2013 Manchester United are believed to be monitoring his situation. With Pochettino\u2019s days at Spurs looking more numbered than a set of balls in a lottery tombola, the club\u2019s fans are worried Harry Kane will join the stampede of senior players who follow him out the door whenever he decides to leave. And finally, the Rangers striker Alfredo Morelos is attracting admiring glances from the other side of the Atlantic, where MLS club LA Galaxy are interested in signing the prolific 23-year-old. With no red cards and 13 goals in 17 appearances this season, the hot-headed Colombian has been recalled to his national team\u2019s squad for matches against Algeria and Chile in this month\u2019s international break.",

Boys. Can. Play.</p> <p>It was 7-3 at the break; 17-10 just after the 50 minute mark. And just thirty minutes later? A 35-point shellacking. This was ball-in-hand running rugby as fine as you\u2019d see anywhere. Semi Radradra put on a winger\u2019s masterclass, but was ably supported by the men around him in white.</p> <p>Many have bemoaned the mismatches at Rugby World Cups in the past, but in a pool boasting Wales, Australia and Georgia, who would have circled the game against Uruguay as the one in which this talented island nation\u2019s hopes would be crushed. By rights we should have been on tenterhooks going into the final round of pool games - a title favourite, Wales or Australia, could have been staring at group-stage elimination. </p> <p>But credit the improvement of so-called minnow nations. Uruguay turned this whole pool upside down, and if Fiji were hurting, it was Georgia who paid for that today.</p> <p>It sets up a tantalising last pool match against Wales for the Pasifika flyers. What a test of the briefly World No 1 side\u2019s pace, guile and organisation out wide.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d959fd78f08fbb0c171fff9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-03T07:16:48.583Z\">8.16am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s the stats on Semi Radradra: </p> <p>two tries, three try assists, 178m run, three line breaks.</p> <p>Unbelievable performance. He fashioned the first try from nothing. They could have gone in trailing at half-time, Fiji, if it wasn\u2019t for him. His ability to sap morale as important as anything else.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d959df68f084ab841731b0f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-03T07:14:18.887Z\">8.14am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Commiserations to Georgia.

      "bodyText": "And here\u2019s the match report: Thanks for your company - we\u2019ll see you again shortly, here on Guardian\u2019s live play-by-play coverage of the Rugby World Cup! It was 11 v 12 in the world, but the mutterings out of the Pacific pre-tournament had been that there was something very special about this Fijian team. After a second half demolition job against Georgia, now the world of rugby is unequivocally clear about this: These. Boys. Can. Play. It was 7-3 at the break; 17-10 just after the 50 minute mark. And just thirty minutes later? A 35-point shellacking. This was ball-in-hand running rugby as fine as you\u2019d see anywhere. Semi Radradra put on a winger\u2019s masterclass, but was ably supported by the men around him in white. Many have bemoaned the mismatches at Rugby World Cups in the past, but in a pool boasting Wales, Australia and Georgia, who would have circled the game against Uruguay as the one in which this talented island nation\u2019s hopes would be crushed. By rights we should have been on tenterhooks going into the final round of pool games - a title favourite, Wales or Australia, could have been staring at group-stage elimination. But credit the improvement of so-called minnow nations. Uruguay turned this whole pool upside down, and if Fiji were hurting, it was Georgia who paid for that today. It sets up a tantalising last pool match against Wales for the Pasifika flyers. What a test of the briefly World No 1 side\u2019s pace, guile and organisation out wide. Here\u2019s the stats on Semi Radradra: two tries, three try assists, 178m run, three line breaks. Unbelievable performance. He fashioned the first try from nothing. They could have gone in trailing at half-time, Fiji, if it wasn\u2019t for him. His ability to sap morale as important as anything else. Commiserations to Georgia. You couldn\u2019t watch that effort, across the eighty minutes and conclude that this was a team that deserved to get beaten by 35 points. It prompts another examination of World Rugby\u2019s scheduling, especially for tier two nations. They wouldn\u2019t have had too many opportunities to play world class backlines like Fijis, and despite 50-odd minutes of contestation, they simply had no answers to a terrifying last thirty blitz. It prompts soul-searching for Fijian Rugby as well though: how by all the old gods and the new did this side manage to fashion a loss against Uruguay?? Incredible against Australia for 50, inspired against Georgia, especially for the last 30. By rights they should be going into the final pool match ready to give Wales the game of their life, and yet, for them (unless there\u2019s another stunning upset by Uruguay against Australia) progression is already a non-option. They do get their noses ahead in the Pool D battle for a third place finish (and consequent 2023 World Cup qualification), so there\u2019s some reward for this excellent performance. 80 min: They play the ball after the gong, Georgia. Fair play to them. It\u2019s a penalty, and they take the lineout. Gorgodze looks to burst through again. But Fiji have pinched it - strong in the tackle. And they kick to touch. What a second half from the Fijians. That was liquid rugby! 78 min: They\u2019re on the fly again, Fiji. Do you reckon that shock loss against Uruguay hurt them? The big bruisers are back in the lineup and doing it in style. The pass doesn\u2019t stick on this occasion, to the relief of some exhausted men in mauve. And in this form - what chance are Fiji of upsetting Wales in their final match? 75 min: Ach, there\u2019s no let up here. And it\u2019s the man of the day, Radradra who helps himself to a double. It\u2019s a midfield turnover and quick hands once again. But they find the winger - and despite the heroic attentions of Beka Gorgadze, he bumps, rolls and grounds it. What a try. Volavola with the conversion. He\u2019s struck that well. Getting better as the game goes on. Paul Pritchard has fired in a tweet: Cheers Paul - wherever we at Guardian liveblogs can help decrease workplace productivity we\u2019re all for it. It\u2019s a good question - I\u2019m going to blame my watching too much basketball recently from the World Cup. My understanding of the phrase is when a team goes end to end in one move. Precise origins? No idea. 70 min: Ach. How\u2019s this. Straight from the kickoff, and they\u2019ve gone right back in! This is almost cruel from Fiji! Radradra with the burst down the touchline - who else. The inside ball to Lomani, who skins one, then two, before picking out a back up runner inside. Too easy. Poor Georgia - they\u2019re broken. Volavol with the conversion - his easiest one all day. And all of a sudden it\u2019s one-way traffic. 68 min: And that\u2019s five! Four big second half tries, and they\u2019ve rolled over the willing Georgians. It\u2019s the other Semi - Semi Kunatani - who backs up another strong bust from Botia. What a wrecking ball he is. We have a brief TMO check, but the grounding is fine. Volavola slots the kick, despite it almost getting a fingertip on it from a Georgian rusher. Gee, that was a near thing. But he slots his third. And this could really blow out. 67 min: Georgia on the back foot now. Fiji are starting to besiege the line, they\u2019ve definitely got their heads up, and the Georgians conversely are starting to flag. A third consecutive penalty, and they set for the scrum. Here comes another big backline move, you\u2019d imagine. 65 min: Oh wow. I hope that one pops up on YouTube. Poor old Ravai, the substitute prop has just copped what you can only describe as an \u201cA-grade falcon\u201d. Lomani with a pass out of scrum half - and it\u2019s flown, straight as an arrow, right into the noggin of the unsuspecting prop! He doesn\u2019t move, still as a statue, and whack. Ball down. A comic moment. 63 min: It\u2019s tough on Georgia, this. They\u2019ve been far from poor - and yet Fiji are now looking at a bonus point, after four tries. It\u2019s been more than just one man, but with a try and three try assists you have to say they just haven\u2019t been able to handle the Big Semi. Terrific performance from Radradra. 61 min: It\u2019s almost the carbon copy from the Fijian backline, this time in reverse. It\u2019s Tuisova who loops round from the opposite wing to provide the extra man in the attack - they spread wide quickly, hit the chest of the big winger, and this time Radradra says: I\u2019ll have this one myself. Devastating. That\u2019s better from Volavola, who plugs the conversion. An important two converted tries the difference now. 59 min: A raft of early changes by Georgia - they\u2019ve shuffled four of their front eight, while for Fiji it\u2019s just the prop Campese Ma\u2019afu who departs for Ravai. But they\u2019ve gone wide again, and would you believe it.. 57 min: We set for the scrum, but it\u2019s not square, is the call. Georgia win another scrum penalty, and kick a booming ball into touch. 55 min: Good defence from Fiji, as they force the pass and turn it over. Botia looks to break the line once again, but the Georgian line stands strong. 52 min: A lightning counter attack! They kick short, and the Fijian lift complete misses the flight of the ball. A runner in mauve flies through the line, they crash within a few metres of the line, and who else - it\u2019s the veteran lock who reaches out through a crash of bodies and finds the stripe! No mistake from the conversion, from near in front. And we\u2019re back - instantly. Game one! 49 min: No release from the Georgian ball carrier - penalty to Fiji. They kick to touch, and now have the chance to spread it. It\u2019s a deep lineout throw and a fine worked move - the long cutout, the overlap run, and then Radradra off the opposite wing. He\u2019s got what - three try assists today? He shrugs the tackle and feeds his opposite winger. Great play - again, not much you can fault from the Georgians, that was terrific running rugby. And he\u2019s just nudged that wide, Volavola. They left a lot of points on the field against Uruguay - hopefully it won\u2019t hurt them today as well. 47 min: A brilliant counter raid from the fullback Matiashvili, who ducks under one tackle, evades another as he tiptoes down the touchline, but it\u2019s the tryscorer Lomani who covers to bundle him into touch! Great tackle. Wow. What a terrific flowing raid. They didn\u2019t do much wrong there, Georgia - but it was spread quickly wide, Radradra bumped the first would be tackler before picking out the inside runner brilliantly with the pass. He still had plenty to do, but the scrum half eventually grounded the ball, despite the attentions of his tackler. Not this time with the conversion from Volavola. Nine points the difference. 43 min: Penalty to Fiji! A brilliant cutout pass wide to put the winger flying down the touchline. There\u2019s no release from the Georgian tackler, and they elect for a scrum, Fiji. Should they have taken the three? I guess that depends on what comes next. 42 min: A nice little audio pickup of referee Paul Williams who congratulates players for rolling away well / getting out the way for obstruction: \u201cNice work five, thank you.\u201d Bless. He\u2019s called into action shortly after though, as we settle for a scrum. A strange little interlude as the skipper Sharikadze refuses to come off for a headknock. We break as the medic\u2019s beseech his departure. Eventually, the Georgian relents and trots off for a concussion test. Second half! And we\u2019re back underway! Georgia kick off, and it\u2019s a fine start for the men in mauve, who put a Fijian into touch, and set up for an attacking lineout. So - your impressions of that first half? Where have either side enjoyed dominance or where have you seen signs of promise for the second half? I\u2019ve been impressed with how quickly Georgia have managed to shut down the Fijian counter-attacks - pushing up out of the line and kicking intelligently, with only one or two poor chases. For their part, Fiji have looked solid up front, not ceding too much territory in the scrum set pieces, and as expected, have been dangerous out wide. The treacherous conditions have to an extent limited their raiding potential - will they play into Georgia\u2019s hands? And will the Borjgalosnebi be upset to be trailing at the break? They didn\u2019t appear to do too much wrong in that first 40, but for one moment switching off - for which they were duly punished. 39 min: Gorgodze with a terrific hit on Volavola who wasn\u2019t expecting that at this stage of the half. We set for a final lineout feed, Georgia\u2019s ball. It goes forward and there\u2019s the half-time whistle. What a tough half of rugby! Tight, tense, but illuminated one terrific play from Semi Radradra. 38 min: And now strength from Botia - who stands over the ball and wins the penalty. What can they muster at the close of the half? Georgia turn it over, but they kick deep. One last run perhaps from the Fijians. 36 min: Terrific hit from Todua - he lines up his man, and the impact spills the ball loose and into touch! They\u2019ve been rugged, and committed, and that hit really sums it up. What a contest this is - the flying feet vs the courageous hearts! They opt for the kick, and this time - there\u2019s no doubt about Matiashvili\u2019s attempt. Three points and finally on the board, Georgia. No less than they deserve across this opening thirty-odd minutes of play. 34 min: We go upstairs - is there a grounding, or is it a knock-on? The Georgian skipper is given the option of two penalty advantages - for offside, and for a high shot from Tuisova on Todua. Ooph. The replays suggest he\u2019s very lucky not to have walked for that! A swinging arm, direct to the head - even if the player ducked a little into it. 32 min: Penalty advantage now to Georgia - this is their best attack of the half; nearly coast-to-coast in this move! They\u2019ve got a host of big men ready for the pick and go, as they besiege the Fijian line. 29 min: Oh my! They\u2019re on the break after another fine backline move, but they\u2019ve dropped it cold, Fiji! Suggestions of a forward pass in that sequence as well, but they\u2019ve really opened Georgia up. John McKee clutches his head in the coaches\u2019 box. They\u2019ve bombed one there, the Pasifika nation. 28 min: Another penalty! We\u2019ve had eight so far - and Fiji don\u2019t bother with the three - they\u2019ve kicked to touch and will chase the seven. Oh my - but they\u2019ve not landed their lineout! Georgia boff it upfield, a monster kick, and they\u2019ve moved the play 60-70m. 26 min: It\u2019s a little stop-start at the moment, as we have a penalty against Georgia, as Radradra is taken in the air. Real danger time for the northern hemisphere-ers. Fiji are looking in the mood, as big bodies start to tire. 24 min: Great run off the lineout, they\u2019re inside 10m out, Fiji. But it\u2019s terrific defence one again! Kacharava, the centre, locks over the ball, and wins the penalty for not releasing! They needed that, Georgia. 22 min: What a sucker punch for Georgia. They\u2019ll need to be careful these next five minutes while tails are up. A penalty against Georgia, offside from Lobzhanidze - as Botia appears to cop a high one in backplay. Fiji kick to touch, and have the chance to attack. 19 min: Ach. Something from nothing! It was an innocuous kick to near touch, Georgia appeared to give it up - but not Radradra, who chased a losing cause and was rewarded with a kindly bounce, before firing a pass back inside to the support runner from outside centre. A lightning raid! And that\u2019s nice from Volavola from the touchline - a fine conversion. 17 min: So we remain scoreless, Georgia with ball in hand, but as I say that they put on the toe and find touch. It\u2019s been a smart kicking game so far, from the Europeans. Or are they technically Asians? Please write to me with a detailed enlightenment: must contain references to the Caucausus etc. 15 min: No mistake from Matiashvili - although from some angles he really did look to have missed that! Who can say. And remarkably - after the kick judges initially raised their flags we\u2019ve had a conference and the decision is penalty missed! The TMO got involved. Have you ever seen that at World Cup rugby?! We\u2019re back to 0-0 - a big let off from a handy area. He fooled the flaggies, Matiashvili, but not the man upstairs. 13 min: They win the jump, but can\u2019t set up the maul. Fiji defend well and get the Georgians on the back foot, but there\u2019s a slightly high tackle from Fiji, and the men in mauve think about a shot at the sticks. 12 min: A huge secondary push from Georgia, and the Fijian front row slumps. Penalty, Georgia - and they kick to touch. Big drive opportunity once again. 11 min: A loose ball, but ripped by a Fijian hand in the attempted one-on-one strip. A pause with a Georgian down in backplay - it\u2019s been a bruising first opening stanza. We set for the scrum, Georgia\u2019s feed. 9 min: The maul is initially stymied, so they swing wide, Georgia. But they run out of real estate and the move is squandered. And now a penalty against Georgia. That rain has now really stepped up - and Fiji try a quick lineout 10m out from their own line, in the wet. You gotta love that. 7 min: Penalty to Georgia - no arms in the tackle from Waqaniburuto the skipper. They kick for touch and have the chance at an offensive lineout. 5 min: Some gentle rain falling in Osaka, as both sides set for a scrum. This will be interesting - they\u2019ve improved a lot in recent time, the Fijians, but here\u2019s a big test. Georgia feed, win and clear, but no signs of dominance at the set piece from either side. The kick is measured perfectedly, and the chase bundles the Fijian winger into touch to regain possession. Fine play. 3 min: It\u2019s Fiji with sustained possession as Botia partially breaks the line, before Yato gets some good metres. They\u2019re about 25m out, Fiji, but it\u2019s been tough defence so far, as you\u2019d expect, from the Georgians. 1 min: It\u2019s a first sign of those slippery conditions, but it\u2019s ball backwards for the Fijians, and play on. They spread wide on their first foray ball in hand. A portent of things to come, no doubt. It\u2019s Ben Volavola who boots us off - he sends it deep, and the Georgians, in a fetching mauve jersey, claim comfortably and clear. We set up for an early lineout. So - to live action: our two sides have come out the tunnel, hit the ground, and it\u2019s the Fijians who lead with their Cibi war dance. Lovely stuff. Sheesh, there\u2019s some beards in this Georgian line up. Some battle-worn faces too. They look tough. An interesting quote pre-game about the slippery balls due to the Japanese humidity. Apparently the Georgians have been practising with soap on the balls. Clever. But to team news - all in two handy info-graphics: It\u2019s a return to \u201cfull strength\u201d teams from both sides, after both fielded weakened outfits against Uruguay (to differing success). Georgia revert to 12 of the 15 that played Wales, with Lasha Khmaladze, Alexander Todua and the aforementioned Sharikadze returning; Fiji return with 13 of the 15 that faced Australia, with Manasa Saulo (who starts instead of Peni Ravai) and Semi Kunatani getting the nod. The big in for the Fijians though is Peceli Yato - the man who gave Australia a torrid time for 50 or so minutes before he was stopped in full flight but a contentious Reece Hodge tackle. Let\u2019s hope he\u2019s firing on all cylinders tonight - what a big in he\u2019ll be for Fiji. Also, if you\u2019ve got the gang together - I\u2019m thinking streamers, decorated rooms, some kind of BBQed meat sizzling away - please let us know. I\u2019d love to hear what you\u2019re all doing today for this crucial Pool D clash. Is is kava o\u2019clock in Suva? Chacha in Tbilisi? For anyone not already in party mood (this is me showing a pre-emptive bias towards the glittering fast feet of Fiji\u2019s backline), I humbly offer the following party-starter. Hi all! The best of greetings to you, from wherever you\u2019re following our coverage today. Are you a Georgian working remotely in the Baltic north trying to warm your heart with good news from Osaka? Or a Fijian backpacking through South America? We love to hear from you - fire us an email or tweet to join the conversation. I\u2019d especially love to hear some brazen pre-game predictions on this one. My heart says Fiji, but my head can\u2019t rule out the strength of the Georgian forwards. After some of the mismatches elsewhere, its fair to say there are no straightforward games in Pool D. Georgia v Fiji may not have earned the headlines of a South Africa v New Zealand or a Australia v Wales, but it could prove to be one of the most decisive pool games. After their shock loss to Uruguay, this is do-or-die time for the hugely talented Fijian squad and their seasoned coaching staff. A 0-3 start is inconceivable - especially after how near they ran Australia. And with a place at the 2023 Rugby World Cup on the line Fiji can\u2019t afford another slip up. For Georgia, conversely back on the winners list after dispatching Los Telos, the dream to aim even higher remains alive - a win could momentarily at least, send them top of the pool. What a final game against Australia that would set up. And their inspirational skipper Merab Sharikadze returns for his first appearance of the tournament. It looms as a drastic clash of styles. Forward v backs. Running rugby v grinding rugby. In rankings, these two are just a scratch below Argentina, and we saw how well Los Pumas pushed France. 11 v 12 - the tier two\u2019s top two, outside hosts Japan. There\u2019s individual skill to burn and no doubt heart to match. Do. Not. Miss. A. Beat.",

They are also potential space-savers because they can be attached to the back of any monitor or TV set that has a standard <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Display_Mounting_Interface\">VESA mount</a>. Anyone unfamiliar with the form factor can read an answer from November 2018, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2018/nov/08/what-is-the-point-mini-pcs\">What is the point of mini PCs?</a></p> <p>However, mini PCs come in at least three overlapping categories. First, there are entry-level models that cost about \u00a3100 to \u00a3350, and are essentially television set-top boxes. Second, there are desktop replacement minis that are widely used in large businesses for their convenience and space-saving properties. Prices range from \u00a3300 to about \u00a31,500.</p> <p>The third category consists of so-called <a href=\"https://techterms.com/definition/barebones\">barebones</a> machines that appeal to computer enthusiasts and other people who want to build their own small-format systems. These could be set-top boxes or desktop replacements depending on the parts used. However, they don\u2019t appeal to home users who want an off-the-shelf set-top box for media streaming, and they don\u2019t appeal to businesses, which buy standardised mini PCs in volume from HP, Lenovo and Dell.</p> <h2><strong>Practical problems</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"445c75ff4df917145c19da0123c8bf0d6b838aaf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/445c75ff4df917145c19da0123c8bf0d6b838aaf/593_0_4352_2612/1000.jpg\" alt=\"At typical TV viewing distances it will be very hard to see and work with the text in Office documents.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At typical TV viewing distances it will be very hard to see and work with the text in Office documents.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ONOKY - Photononstop/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Your question is about the feasibility of using a (roughly) \u00a3250 mini PC hooked up to a 32in TV for Microsoft Office and some other uses, such as managing music and photo libraries. There are a couple of reasons why I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea.</p> <p>The main problem is that it\u2019s not practical to use programs such as Word and Excel at typical TV viewing distances, especially not with such a small TV set. In the old days, interface designers distinguished between \u201cthe 3ft experience\u201d of using a computer monitor and \u201cthe 10ft experience\u201d of using a TV set. They needed radically different approaches, and different-sized icons and text.</p> <p>Even if we assume the TV set can display small text sharply enough, your mum will need to be around 3ft/1 metre from the screen to make it usable. Based on my long experience of watching TV in normal-sized living rooms, I\u2019ll be surprised if this is practical. However, you can easily check this by plugging mum\u2019s current Windows laptop into her TV set.</p> <p>The other problem is your budget. There are plenty of very cheap mini PCs, but their specifications generally include an old and slow Intel Atom processor, 2GB or 4GB of memory, and 32GB of eMMC chip storage, which is pretty much on a par with an SD card. Amazingly enough, machines like this will run Microsoft Office with home-sized documents, but they are underpowered for what your mother needs.</p> <p>Worse, any PC with limited storage \u2013 32GB or 64GB \u2013 may run into problems updating Windows 10 twice a year, even though it should be able to handle upgrades by using, say, an external hard drive as temporary storage space. (Presumably your mum already has one for backup purposes. If not, install some kind of backup solution as soon as possible.)</p> <p>Unless your mum\u2019s music and photo libraries are very small, even 128GB may not be enough. Fortunately, you can solve this problem by buying something that has an SD card slot. Put all your mum\u2019s music, photos and documents onto a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/SanDisk-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter-Performance/dp/B073JYC4XM/\">128GB SanDisk Ultra</a> (\u00a316.98) or similar card, put shortcuts to the three directories on the Windows desktop, and reserve the main eMMC or SSD drive for the operating system and applications.</p> <h2><strong>Mini PC picks</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aecb7059a23f11f156c88182c8b1e73aea69252f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aecb7059a23f11f156c88182c8b1e73aea69252f/0_0_1920_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beelink J45 mini PC\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Beelink J45 mini PC.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Beelink</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You can still buy a reasonable mini PC on your budget. I\u2019d usually suggest a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Beelink-Desktop-License-Multimedia-Computer/dp/B07MW7BM14/\">Beelink J45</a> with a quad-core Pentium Silver J4205 processor, 8GB of memory, a 128GB SSD and Windows 10 Home for \u00a3241.90. Including any cables, you\u2019d probably be under budget with a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Logitech-Wireless-Keyboard-Windows-Android/dp/B00XJ3LVPI/\">Logitech K400</a> wireless keyboard currently going for almost half price (\u00a317.99) on Amazon.co.uk. I\u2019m suggesting the K400 keyboard because it has a touchpad, whereas the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Logitech-Wireless-Keyboard-Windows-Connection/dp/B00CL6353A/\">Logitech MK270</a> (\u00a317) is a standard keyboard plus a mouse.</p> <p>Unusually, the same Beelink page at Amazon has some better deals. For example, the same Beelink J45 with a 256GB SSD is currently being discounted by \u00a375 to <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Beelink-Desktop-License-Multimedia-Computer/dp/B07MW9QR19/\">\u00a3193.80</a>, so the version with 256GB of storage is much cheaper than the one with 128GB.</p> <p>Alternatively, you could get a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Beelink-Desktop-License-Multimedia-Computer/dp/B07VSTWQ1Z/\">Beelink L55</a> with a faster, but rather old, <a href=\"http://cpuboss.com/cpus/Intel-J4205-vs-Intel-Core-i3-5005U\">Core i3-5005U</a> processor for \u00a3218.84. How this differs from the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Beelink-Desktop-Computer-Processor-1000Mbps/dp/B07NQ2BT7R/\">Beelink U55</a> that has the same specification for \u00a3299.90 remains a mystery.</p> <p>Suppliers rarely sell their higher-spec PCs for less than their lower-spec versions, so either I\u2019m missing something or the apparent anomalies won\u2019t last very long.</p> <h2><strong>Add a monitor?</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2664e0ba68fde27a9d0c70c6744fcf211a46a8c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2664e0ba68fde27a9d0c70c6744fcf211a46a8c2/0_167_4219_2532/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A cheap monitor could be infinitely better than a PC connected to a TV for Office applications, but only if you have the space.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A cheap monitor could be infinitely better than a PC connected to a TV for Office applications, but only if you have the space.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since the small TV set is likely to be a problem, you could either spend quite a lot of money on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07Q32YKNB/\">a bigger TV set</a> or a smaller amount on a computer monitor. For example, you could get your mother a 21.5in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dell-SE2219H-21-5-LED-backlit-Monitor/dp/B07HS74H5P/\">Dell SE2219H</a> IPS screen for \u00a399.95, or the same-sized <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/HP-inch-Monitor-Pixel-Refresh/dp/B072Z8PPWZ/\">HP 22w</a> for \u00a379.99. Either of these 1920 x 1080-pixel Full HD screens would work with a mini PC and provide much more comfortable viewing for a pair of ageing eyes.</p> <p>If you buy a mini PC for closer to \u00a3200 then you could still come in around your budget price with either of these monitors, as long as your mother can find space for the extra screen.</p> <p>This is well worth considering because mum will get a better screen and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Logitech-Business-Keyboard-Windows-Linux/dp/B003ZY9Z40/\">keyboard</a>, and an all-round better system by combining a mini PC and a monitor than she would get with a cheap laptop or all-in-one.</p> <p>The package price also compares well against the cost of an iPad or an iPhone, not to mention a <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-mac/mac-mini/3.6ghz-quad-core-processor-128gb\">Mac Mini</a> (\u00a3799 with only 128GB of storage).</p> <h2><strong>Laptop options</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee7630a7c3136ae0f4adbf8c93ccf4df1abb6619\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee7630a7c3136ae0f4adbf8c93ccf4df1abb6619/0_354_5310_3186/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Some cheap laptops are more trouble than they\u2019re worth and a false economy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Some cheap laptops are more trouble than they\u2019re worth and a false economy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Under the circumstances, you may want to take the easy way out and replace mum\u2019s old laptop with a new laptop. It\u2019s some time since I looked at cheap laptops, and my most recent answer covered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2019/aug/15/whats-the-best-laptop-for-a-student-for-under-500\">laptops costing up to \u00a3500</a>. You can still buy \u201creal\u201d laptops for less, but below \u00a3300, the experience gets progressively worse.</p> <p>Yes, you can live with a laptop that has limited screen resolution (1366 x 768 pixels), a slow Intel Pentium or Celeron processor, only 4GB of memory and a traditional hard drive, but you can do dramatically better for not a lot more money.</p> <p>For example, the 15.6in <a href=\"https://www.argos.co.uk/product/8677923\">Asus X540</a> is an entry-level laptop with that sort of spec (Pentium Silver N5000, 4GB, 1TB HDD) and good value at \u00a3249.99 from Argos. But you could get a similar machine such as the <a href=\"https://www.ebuyer.com/874549-hp-255-g7-ryzen-3-8gb-256gb-full-hd-15-6in-win10-laptop-6bn96ea-abu\">HP 255 G7</a> with a Full HD screen, <a href=\"https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Intel-Pentium-Silver-N5000-vs-AMD-Ryzen-3-2200U/m499477vsm480281\">slightly faster AMD Ryzen 3 2200U</a> with Vega 3 graphics, 8GB of memory (expandable) and a 256GB SSD for \u00a3329.98 from eBuyer.</p> <p>Indeed, for preference, go for the version of the HP laptop with an <a href=\"https://www.ebuyer.com/879510-hp-250-g7-laptop-intel-core-i5-8265u-1-6ghz-8gb-ddr4-256gb-ssd-6mp21es-abu\">Intel Core i5-8265U</a> processor for \u00a3399.99, or the smarter looking <a href=\"https://www.ebuyer.com/901659-lenovo-v155-15api-amd-ryzen-5-3500u-8gb-256gb-ssd-15-6-inch-full-hd-81v50008uk\">Lenovo V155-15API</a> with a Ryzen 5 3500U and Vega 8 graphics for the same price.</p> <p>Low specs are a false economy. Today, 8GB of RAM costs about \u00a330, so fitting 4GB instead of 8GB only saves $20 at retail prices. It must save even less at the wholesale prices that HP and Lenovo pay when they are buying more than 1m memory modules a week. At current prices, it\u2019s crazy to buy PCs with only 4GB, unless you plan to add more memory instantly.</p> <p><strong>Have you got a question?

      "bodyText": "My retired mother happily uses her iPhone and iPad for the majority of her digital needs, but she uses an old, low-spec Windows 7 laptop for Microsoft Office documents for various committees she sits on, for her music library and digital photos, some web browsing and other tasks that cannot be easily done on a small device. I have a Mac Mini running through a 42in TV set, and we are interested in the feasibility of using a mini PC hooked up to her 32in TV. Target budget is \u00a3300 for PC, keyboard and any adaptors. For the OS evangelists among your readers, I use a Mac and I may well repurpose her laptop with Linux, but Mum wants Windows. Ant Mini or micro PCs are terrific at what they do, as long as you don\u2019t expect them to do too much. They are also potential space-savers because they can be attached to the back of any monitor or TV set that has a standard VESA mount. Anyone unfamiliar with the form factor can read an answer from November 2018, What is the point of mini PCs? However, mini PCs come in at least three overlapping categories. First, there are entry-level models that cost about \u00a3100 to \u00a3350, and are essentially television set-top boxes. Second, there are desktop replacement minis that are widely used in large businesses for their convenience and space-saving properties. Prices range from \u00a3300 to about \u00a31,500. The third category consists of so-called barebones machines that appeal to computer enthusiasts and other people who want to build their own small-format systems. These could be set-top boxes or desktop replacements depending on the parts used. However, they don\u2019t appeal to home users who want an off-the-shelf set-top box for media streaming, and they don\u2019t appeal to businesses, which buy standardised mini PCs in volume from HP, Lenovo and Dell. Practical problems Your question is about the feasibility of using a (roughly) \u00a3250 mini PC hooked up to a 32in TV for Microsoft Office and some other uses, such as managing music and photo libraries. There are a couple of reasons why I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea. The main problem is that it\u2019s not practical to use programs such as Word and Excel at typical TV viewing distances, especially not with such a small TV set. In the old days, interface designers distinguished between \u201cthe 3ft experience\u201d of using a computer monitor and \u201cthe 10ft experience\u201d of using a TV set. They needed radically different approaches, and different-sized icons and text. Even if we assume the TV set can display small text sharply enough, your mum will need to be around 3ft/1 metre from the screen to make it usable. Based on my long experience of watching TV in normal-sized living rooms, I\u2019ll be surprised if this is practical. However, you can easily check this by plugging mum\u2019s current Windows laptop into her TV set. The other problem is your budget. There are plenty of very cheap mini PCs, but their specifications generally include an old and slow Intel Atom processor, 2GB or 4GB of memory, and 32GB of eMMC chip storage, which is pretty much on a par with an SD card. Amazingly enough, machines like this will run Microsoft Office with home-sized documents, but they are underpowered for what your mother needs. Worse, any PC with limited storage \u2013 32GB or 64GB \u2013 may run into problems updating Windows 10 twice a year, even though it should be able to handle upgrades by using, say, an external hard drive as temporary storage space. (Presumably your mum already has one for backup purposes. If not, install some kind of backup solution as soon as possible.) Unless your mum\u2019s music and photo libraries are very small, even 128GB may not be enough. Fortunately, you can solve this problem by buying something that has an SD card slot. Put all your mum\u2019s music, photos and documents onto a 128GB SanDisk Ultra (\u00a316.98) or similar card, put shortcuts to the three directories on the Windows desktop, and reserve the main eMMC or SSD drive for the operating system and applications. Mini PC picks You can still buy a reasonable mini PC on your budget. I\u2019d usually suggest a Beelink J45 with a quad-core Pentium Silver J4205 processor, 8GB of memory, a 128GB SSD and Windows 10 Home for \u00a3241.90. Including any cables, you\u2019d probably be under budget with a Logitech K400 wireless keyboard currently going for almost half price (\u00a317.99) on Amazon.co.uk. I\u2019m suggesting the K400 keyboard because it has a touchpad, whereas the Logitech MK270 (\u00a317) is a standard keyboard plus a mouse. Unusually, the same Beelink page at Amazon has some better deals. For example, the same Beelink J45 with a 256GB SSD is currently being discounted by \u00a375 to \u00a3193.80, so the version with 256GB of storage is much cheaper than the one with 128GB. Alternatively, you could get a Beelink L55 with a faster, but rather old, Core i3-5005U processor for \u00a3218.84. How this differs from the Beelink U55 that has the same specification for \u00a3299.90 remains a mystery. Suppliers rarely sell their higher-spec PCs for less than their lower-spec versions, so either I\u2019m missing something or the apparent anomalies won\u2019t last very long. Add a monitor? Since the small TV set is likely to be a problem, you could either spend quite a lot of money on a bigger TV set or a smaller amount on a computer monitor. For example, you could get your mother a 21.5in Dell SE2219H IPS screen for \u00a399.95, or the same-sized HP 22w for \u00a379.99. Either of these 1920 x 1080-pixel Full HD screens would work with a mini PC and provide much more comfortable viewing for a pair of ageing eyes. If you buy a mini PC for closer to \u00a3200 then you could still come in around your budget price with either of these monitors, as long as your mother can find space for the extra screen. This is well worth considering because mum will get a better screen and keyboard, and an all-round better system by combining a mini PC and a monitor than she would get with a cheap laptop or all-in-one. The package price also compares well against the cost of an iPad or an iPhone, not to mention a Mac Mini (\u00a3799 with only 128GB of storage). Laptop options Under the circumstances, you may want to take the easy way out and replace mum\u2019s old laptop with a new laptop. It\u2019s some time since I looked at cheap laptops, and my most recent answer covered laptops costing up to \u00a3500. You can still buy \u201creal\u201d laptops for less, but below \u00a3300, the experience gets progressively worse. Yes, you can live with a laptop that has limited screen resolution (1366 x 768 pixels), a slow Intel Pentium or Celeron processor, only 4GB of memory and a traditional hard drive, but you can do dramatically better for not a lot more money. For example, the 15.6in Asus X540 is an entry-level laptop with that sort of spec (Pentium Silver N5000, 4GB, 1TB HDD) and good value at \u00a3249.99 from Argos. But you could get a similar machine such as the HP 255 G7 with a Full HD screen, slightly faster AMD Ryzen 3 2200U with Vega 3 graphics, 8GB of memory (expandable) and a 256GB SSD for \u00a3329.98 from eBuyer. Indeed, for preference, go for the version of the HP laptop with an Intel Core i5-8265U processor for \u00a3399.99, or the smarter looking Lenovo V155-15API with a Ryzen 5 3500U and Vega 8 graphics for the same price. Low specs are a false economy. Today, 8GB of RAM costs about \u00a330, so fitting 4GB instead of 8GB only saves $20 at retail prices. It must save even less at the wholesale prices that HP and Lenovo pay when they are buying more than 1m memory modules a week. At current prices, it\u2019s crazy to buy PCs with only 4GB, unless you plan to add more memory instantly. Have you got a question? Email it to Ask.Jack@theguardian.com",

      "body": "<p>Lucy Parker\u2019s film is about a nasty, dirty, century-old little secret at the heart of the British state: industrial surveillance. It is about the Blacklist Support Group, formed 10 years ago when it was revealed that construction firms such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/balfourbeatty\" title=\"\">Balfour Beatty</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/carillion\" title=\"\">Carillion</a> had been submitting names of supposed troublemakers among the workforce (people who were sometimes doing nothing more than demanding back pay and union representation) to a central snoopers\u2019 body they were bankrolling, blandly called the Consulting Association.</p> <p>This grew out of another body called the Economic League, formed in 1919, and its mission was to circulate \u2013 and continuously update and expand \u2013 a blacklist of workers who would then mysteriously find themselves unable to get jobs. Keen to justify their meal ticket, the beady-eyed blacklisters would look for more and more people whose working lives they could ruin: people who sometimes were doing nothing more than writing to the local press on leftist issues.</p> <p>Then the Data Protection Act meant that their little list was illegal and the Consulting Association found itself in court in 2009. But Parker\u2019s film shows how questions are still unanswered, mainly the group\u2019s interest in environmental activists and the extent to which the police and special branch offered their own help to the blacklisters.

      "bodyText": "Lucy Parker\u2019s film is about a nasty, dirty, century-old little secret at the heart of the British state: industrial surveillance. It is about the Blacklist Support Group, formed 10 years ago when it was revealed that construction firms such as Balfour Beatty and Carillion had been submitting names of supposed troublemakers among the workforce (people who were sometimes doing nothing more than demanding back pay and union representation) to a central snoopers\u2019 body they were bankrolling, blandly called the Consulting Association. This grew out of another body called the Economic League, formed in 1919, and its mission was to circulate \u2013 and continuously update and expand \u2013 a blacklist of workers who would then mysteriously find themselves unable to get jobs. Keen to justify their meal ticket, the beady-eyed blacklisters would look for more and more people whose working lives they could ruin: people who sometimes were doing nothing more than writing to the local press on leftist issues. Then the Data Protection Act meant that their little list was illegal and the Consulting Association found itself in court in 2009. But Parker\u2019s film shows how questions are still unanswered, mainly the group\u2019s interest in environmental activists and the extent to which the police and special branch offered their own help to the blacklisters. There is also the question of how surveillance is morphing and evolving with infiltration and undercover work: police officers seducing and even forming relationships with women in the environmental movement \u2013 sexual opportunities being apparently a perk of the job. Parker\u2019s film is not perfect \u2013 it is a little unfocused, taking on a lot of disparate but related issues in its brief 75-minute running time.

      "body": "<p>When Blondie\u2019s singer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/debbie-harry\" title=\"\">Debbie Harry</a>, was crafting her image as a pop star in the mid-70s, she looked first to cinema. Her love of cartoon fantasy figures led her to Barbarella, as portrayed by Jane Fonda in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/05/new-barbarella-comic-original-film\" title=\"\">Roger Vadim film</a>, though her biggest influence was Marilyn Monroe, who she recognised \u201cwas playing a character, the proverbial dumb blonde with the little-girl voice and the big-girl body \u2026 a woman playing a man\u2019s idea of a woman\u201d. As the only woman in an all-male band, Harry knew she had to make her mark. With her peroxide hair, thrift-store clothes and expression that sat somewhere between a pout and a sneer, she was a pin-up with a subversive streak: \u201cMy Blondie character was an inflatable doll but with a dark, provocative, aggressive side. I was playing it up yet I was very serious.\u201d</p> <p>In <em>Face It</em>, Harry, who is now 74, outlines the influences and events that led to her rise to fame. Written with the music writer Sylvie Simmons, the memoir is based on a series of lengthy interviews, which makes for a conversational style, though anyone looking for an excavation of the soul might be disappointed. Harry has rock \u2019n\u2019 roll stories to burn but the memoir as a confessional isn\u2019t her style. For the most part, the Blondie character remains.</p> <p>The music, which merged punk rock with pop sensibilities, is only part of the picture; having been awarded the title \u201cbest-looking girl\u201d in her school yearbook, Harry knew the value of her attractiveness early on, and later created an industry around her image. It was she, for instance, who saw an upturned car on a New York street and, rather than moving on, declared it ideal for a photoshoot. Before designers were lining up to work with her, she would find a pillowcase and turn it into a stage outfit; later, years before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/lady-gaga\" title=\"\">Lady Gaga</a>\u2019s meat dress, she would step out in a gown made of razorblades. Harry was driven not by a quest for fame but for creativity. \u201cUltimately for me,\u201d she notes, \u201cit\u2019s the overwhelming need to have my entire life be an imaginative out-of-body experience.\u201d</p> <p>We learn how, having been given up for adoption at three months old, Harry was raised by her adoptive parents in New Jersey. Before Blondie took off, she worked variously as a model, a secretary at the BBC\u2019s New York office, a waitress and a Playboy bunny, all the while trying to figure out her next move. When she first moved to New York, she wanted to be a painter but, after seeing the likes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/janis-joplin\" title=\"\">Janis Joplin</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/velvetunderground\" title=\"\">Velvet Underground</a> and, later, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/apr/09/philipfrench6\" title=\"\">New York Dolls</a>, she decided music was her calling. Harry joined and left various bands including the Stilettos, through which she met Chris Stein, who would become her principal collaborator as the guitarist in Blondie, her partner for the next 13 years and, after their split, one of her dearest friends.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"39443009e70f39996d0c82da4b8a392cadf0fbeb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/39443009e70f39996d0c82da4b8a392cadf0fbeb/12_8_1880_1247/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Debbie Harry and Chris Stein in New York, 1980\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Caustic and funny.\u2019 Debbie Harry and Chris Stein in New York, 1980</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allan Tannenbaum</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Early on, Harry offers a vivid portrait of a seedy, bohemian scene in late-60s New York in which drugs were \u201cpart of your social life, part of the creative process, chic and fun and really just there. No one thought about the consequences.\u201d Describing her first encounter with heroin with her then-boyfriend, she recalls: \u201cIt was so delicious and delightful \u2026 For those times when I wanted to blank out parts of my life or when I was dealing with some depression, there was nothing better than heroin. Nothing.\u201d</p> <p>A similar matter-of-factness runs through her recollections of the man who approached her and Stein one night outside their front door and threatened them with a knife. When they said they didn\u2019t have any money, he insisted on accompanying them into their apartment. There he tied up Stein and Harry while he piled up their guitars and amps by the front door. He then untied Harry and raped her. \u201cI can\u2019t say that I felt a lot of fear,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI\u2019m very glad this happened pre-Aids or I might have freaked. In the end, the stolen guitars hurt me more than the rape.\u201d</p> <p>Her account of the incident indicates the somewhat detached tone of this memoir. Whether reflecting on her fruitless search for her birth parents, or the New Jersey ex-boyfriend who stalked her and threatened her with a gun, or the close shave with a man who offered her a lift, and whom she believes to have been the serial killer Ted Bundy, Harry allows no room for shock, sadness or vulnerability.

      "bodyText": "When Blondie\u2019s singer, Debbie Harry, was crafting her image as a pop star in the mid-70s, she looked first to cinema. Her love of cartoon fantasy figures led her to Barbarella, as portrayed by Jane Fonda in the Roger Vadim film, though her biggest influence was Marilyn Monroe, who she recognised \u201cwas playing a character, the proverbial dumb blonde with the little-girl voice and the big-girl body \u2026 a woman playing a man\u2019s idea of a woman\u201d. As the only woman in an all-male band, Harry knew she had to make her mark. With her peroxide hair, thrift-store clothes and expression that sat somewhere between a pout and a sneer, she was a pin-up with a subversive streak: \u201cMy Blondie character was an inflatable doll but with a dark, provocative, aggressive side. I was playing it up yet I was very serious.\u201d In Face It, Harry, who is now 74, outlines the influences and events that led to her rise to fame. Written with the music writer Sylvie Simmons, the memoir is based on a series of lengthy interviews, which makes for a conversational style, though anyone looking for an excavation of the soul might be disappointed. Harry has rock \u2019n\u2019 roll stories to burn but the memoir as a confessional isn\u2019t her style. For the most part, the Blondie character remains. The music, which merged punk rock with pop sensibilities, is only part of the picture; having been awarded the title \u201cbest-looking girl\u201d in her school yearbook, Harry knew the value of her attractiveness early on, and later created an industry around her image. It was she, for instance, who saw an upturned car on a New York street and, rather than moving on, declared it ideal for a photoshoot. Before designers were lining up to work with her, she would find a pillowcase and turn it into a stage outfit; later, years before Lady Gaga\u2019s meat dress, she would step out in a gown made of razorblades. Harry was driven not by a quest for fame but for creativity. \u201cUltimately for me,\u201d she notes, \u201cit\u2019s the overwhelming need to have my entire life be an imaginative out-of-body experience.\u201d We learn how, having been given up for adoption at three months old, Harry was raised by her adoptive parents in New Jersey. Before Blondie took off, she worked variously as a model, a secretary at the BBC\u2019s New York office, a waitress and a Playboy bunny, all the while trying to figure out her next move. When she first moved to New York, she wanted to be a painter but, after seeing the likes of Janis Joplin, the Velvet Underground and, later, the New York Dolls, she decided music was her calling. Harry joined and left various bands including the Stilettos, through which she met Chris Stein, who would become her principal collaborator as the guitarist in Blondie, her partner for the next 13 years and, after their split, one of her dearest friends. Early on, Harry offers a vivid portrait of a seedy, bohemian scene in late-60s New York in which drugs were \u201cpart of your social life, part of the creative process, chic and fun and really just there. No one thought about the consequences.\u201d Describing her first encounter with heroin with her then-boyfriend, she recalls: \u201cIt was so delicious and delightful \u2026 For those times when I wanted to blank out parts of my life or when I was dealing with some depression, there was nothing better than heroin. Nothing.\u201d A similar matter-of-factness runs through her recollections of the man who approached her and Stein one night outside their front door and threatened them with a knife. When they said they didn\u2019t have any money, he insisted on accompanying them into their apartment. There he tied up Stein and Harry while he piled up their guitars and amps by the front door. He then untied Harry and raped her. \u201cI can\u2019t say that I felt a lot of fear,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI\u2019m very glad this happened pre-Aids or I might have freaked. In the end, the stolen guitars hurt me more than the rape.\u201d Her account of the incident indicates the somewhat detached tone of this memoir. Whether reflecting on her fruitless search for her birth parents, or the New Jersey ex-boyfriend who stalked her and threatened her with a gun, or the close shave with a man who offered her a lift, and whom she believes to have been the serial killer Ted Bundy, Harry allows no room for shock, sadness or vulnerability. This is, of course, the author\u2019s prerogative and doesn\u2019t mean that the book is without depth or charm. She can be caustic and funny, and is drily unfazed by the antics of her mostly male peers. While on tour with Iggy Pop and David Bowie, the latter flashes his penis at Harry in the dressing room \u201cas if I were the official cock checker or something\u201d. Noting Bowie\u2019s generously proportioned appendage, she is moved to wonder \u201cwhy Iggy didn\u2019t let me have a closer look at his dick\u201d. As her star rises in the late 1970s, towering cultural figures drift in and out of her orbit, among them Miles Davis, Patti Smith, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Andy Warhol. While playing a series of shows in LA, she and Stein are invited to meet Phil Spector at his mansion. He greets them \u201cwith a Colt 45 in one hand and a bottle of Manischewitz [kosher wine] in the other\u201d.

Duke and colleagues returned for a second follow-up monitoring trip to find devastating impacts of two cyclones had created a 400km stretch of dead and damaged mangroves. In December 2018, Cyclone Owen battered the gulf\u2019s coast and then, just three month\u2019s later, the category 4 Cyclone Trevor struck just to the south of Owen\u2019s impact area. \u201cWe are getting these compounding effects that we just didn\u2019t expect,\u201d Duke told Guardian Australia. \u201cThe mangroves hit in the 2015 dieback are already vulnerable because they are just recovering.

Duke said it was \u201cabundantly clear\u201d that the estuaries that flow into the gulf had greater levels of erosion than he had previously seen. \u201cThere will almost certainly be impacts on fisheries and the ability of mangroves to protect the coasts from erosion,\u201d he said.

About 8,000 hectares (20,000 acres) of mangroves had been affected. Earlier this week, a major study found that Australia was a global hotspot for carbon stored in mangroves, seagrasses and tidal marshes, but warned degradation of the ecosystems was already releasing about 3m tonnes of CO2 a year. The findings quantified for the first time the major role that \u201cvegetated coastal ecosystems\u201d play in absorbing and locking away carbon.

Varadkar warned the prime minister that the legal texts tabled \u201cdo not fully meet the agreed objectives of the backstop\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/02/brexit-tactics-what-strategy-behind-boris-johnson-plan\">Brexit tactics: what is the strategy behind Boris Johnson's plan?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/02/boris-johnson-speech-gives-eu-hope-he-will-rethink-irish-plan\">told the prime minister in his phone call that there remained \u201cproblematic points\u201d</a>.</p> \n<p>It is understood that the European parliament\u2019s Brexit steering group will say on Thursday that MEPs will not vote in support of the deal proposed by the UK government. \u201cThe reaction of the Brexit steering group was not positive,\u201d the group\u2019s coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, told reporters after a briefing from Barnier. \u201cNot positive in that we don\u2019t think really there are the safeguards that Ireland needs.\u201d</p> \n<p>EU sources said that such were the flaws in the UK\u2019s proposals that there appeared scant chance of agreement by a crunch EU summit on 17 October. \u201cUnfortunately we are heading for an extension,\u201d said one diplomatic source. Under the Benn act, Johnson will be instructed to request and agree an extension if a deal is not passed by parliament by 19 October.</p> \n<p>In his speech in Manchester, the prime minister attacked parliament for seeking to block <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a>, repeatedly praised the NHS and warned the EU27 that he was determined to take Britain out of the EU on 31 October.</p> \n<p>He sought to ramp up the pressure on Brussels by insisting Britain is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/02/boris-johnson-asks-tory-conference-are-we-ready-for-no-deal-brexit\">now ready to leave without a deal</a> at the end of this month. \u201cThat is not an outcome we want, it is not an outcome we seek at all \u2013 but let me tell you, my friends, it is an outcome for which we are ready,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>He then asked the packed hall in Manchester: \u201cAre we ready for it?\u201d The audience shouted back: \u201cYes!\u201d</p> \n<p>On a carefully choreographed day, more details of his five-point Brexit offer were then laid out in a letter to Juncker, in which he warned there is now \u201cvery little time\u201d left in which a deal can be done.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis government wants to get a deal, as I\u2019m sure we all do.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson appears to be fighting a losing battle to avoid Britain staying in the European Union beyond 31 October after Michel Barnier privately gave a scathing analysis of the prime minister\u2019s new plan for the Irish border, describing it as a trap. The European commission also refused to go into the secretive and intensive \u201ctunnel\u201d talks with the UK\u2019s negotiators before a crunch summit on 17 October from which the UK had hoped to deliver a breakthrough deal. Despite concerted attempts to avoid publicly trashing the UK proposals, there was dismay behind the scenes in Brussels after Johnson tabled his first concrete proposal for replacing the Irish backstop. The prime minister had set out the outline of the government\u2019s offer in a speech to Tory party faithful in Manchester that also laid down the battle lines for a general election. On Wednesday night, he was hopeful a parliamentary majority could be assembled to back it. Johnson\u2019s plan involves Northern Ireland leaving the EU\u2019s customs union at the end of transition along with the rest of the UK, necessitating checks and controls on the island of Ireland. Northern Ireland would also stay aligned with EU standards on goods if Stormont agreed by December 2020, the end of the transition period, and then in a vote every four years. But the UK has also requested that both sides commit at treaty level \u201cnever to conduct checks at the border\u201d even if Stormont vetoes the arrangements laid out in the new 44-page Irish protocol. Barnier said that this commitment would prevent Brussels from protecting its internal market if the Northern Ireland assembly blocked the arrangement in 2020 or at a later date. \u201cThe EU would then be trapped with no backstop to preserve the single market after Brexit,\u201d he warned, according to someone present in the room. The Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, issued a sombre statement after a phone call on Wednesday afternoon with Johnson. Varadkar warned the prime minister that the legal texts tabled \u201cdo not fully meet the agreed objectives of the backstop\u201d. Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, told the prime minister in his phone call that there remained \u201cproblematic points\u201d. It is understood that the European parliament\u2019s Brexit steering group will say on Thursday that MEPs will not vote in support of the deal proposed by the UK government. \u201cThe reaction of the Brexit steering group was not positive,\u201d the group\u2019s coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, told reporters after a briefing from Barnier. \u201cNot positive in that we don\u2019t think really there are the safeguards that Ireland needs.\u201d EU sources said that such were the flaws in the UK\u2019s proposals that there appeared scant chance of agreement by a crunch EU summit on 17 October. \u201cUnfortunately we are heading for an extension,\u201d said one diplomatic source. Under the Benn act, Johnson will be instructed to request and agree an extension if a deal is not passed by parliament by 19 October. In his speech in Manchester, the prime minister attacked parliament for seeking to block Brexit, repeatedly praised the NHS and warned the EU27 that he was determined to take Britain out of the EU on 31 October. He sought to ramp up the pressure on Brussels by insisting Britain is now ready to leave without a deal at the end of this month. \u201cThat is not an outcome we want, it is not an outcome we seek at all \u2013 but let me tell you, my friends, it is an outcome for which we are ready,\u201d he said. He then asked the packed hall in Manchester: \u201cAre we ready for it?\u201d The audience shouted back: \u201cYes!\u201d On a carefully choreographed day, more details of his five-point Brexit offer were then laid out in a letter to Juncker, in which he warned there is now \u201cvery little time\u201d left in which a deal can be done. \u201cThis government wants to get a deal, as I\u2019m sure we all do. If we cannot reach one, it would represent a failure of statecraft for which we would all be responsible,\u201d Johnson said. Johnson said the plan was a \u201cfair and reasonable compromise\u201d, and talked of a \u201cbroad landing zone, in which I believe a deal can begin to take shape\u201d. He added: \u201cThere is very little time \u2026 We need to get this done before the October European council.\u201d Johnson has won the support of the Democratic Unionist party, which has been closely involved in discussions about the plan in recent days. Ministers believe the DUP is the \u201ccanary in the coalmine\u201d, whose objections to Theresa May\u2019s deal helped to kill it with the pro-Brexit European Research Group (ERG). They hope the DUP\u2019s approval will help to win over many of those Conservatives who rejected May\u2019s deal. Steve Baker, the ERG chairman, tweeted that Johnson was a \u201chero\u201d after his conference speech, signalling his approval for the PM\u2019s approach. With the DUP, and the eurosceptics of the European Research Group on board, Johnson also appears within touching distance of assembling a parliamentary majority for the plan. May\u2019s Brexit plan fell apart when MPs rejected it three times, and No 10 believes the EU leaders may be more persuadable if they believe a deal could pass through parliament. Jeremy Corbyn dismissed Johnson\u2019s proposals. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s worse than May\u2019s deal. I can\u2019t see it getting the support that he thinks it will get.\u201d Speaking to Sky News, the Labour leader said Johnson would create a Britain of deregulation and of undercutting, adding: \u201cIt will also undermine the Good Friday agreement.\u201d Asked how it was worse than May\u2019s proposals, he said \u201cparticularly the section on Northern Ireland\u201d and \u201ca specific intention to deregulate alongside Europe\u201d. Corbyn urged Johnson to come to the Commons on Thursday to explain his plan, adding that Labour would be telling him it was \u201cnot acceptable\u201d. The Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, was similarly unimpressed, tweeting: \u201cHard to see how the UK government Brexit \u2018proposals\u2019 fly. And hard to escape conclusion that they\u2019re designed to fail.\u201d Government sources said either Johnson or Steve Barclay, the Brexit secretary, would make a statement to MPs. Parliament is then expected to be suspended on Tuesday, to allow the government time to prepare for a Queen\u2019s speech on 14 October, setting out what Johnson calls the \u201cpeople\u2019s priorities\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>For the last five years, the independent game designer <a href=\"http://ninasays.so/\">Nina Freeman</a>, working with small teams of collaborators, has been exploring the boundaries and connections between video games, art and autobiography. Her witty, ethereal projects often involve her own experiences with family and lovers, and tease relatable truths from the most subtle interactions: a girl learning about sex while playing with dolls; a young woman\u2019s online relationship explored through the folders on her PC desktop. As a \u201cplayer\u201d, your role is often subtle, flitting between embodiment, friendship and voyeurism.</p> <p>We Met in May is a set of four vignette games about the early moments in a romantic relationship, ostensibly between Nina herself and the game\u2019s co-creator and artist, Jake Jefferies. In Nothing to Hide, Nina has invited Jake back to her flat for the first time and, bashful about its untidiness and her collection of anime plushies and posters, considers hiding things from him \u2013 it\u2019s up to the player to decide what she conceals. In Beach Date, Nina and Jake lounge at the seaside and, controlling her arm with the cursor, you can pile sand or suncream on to him, or try to pour wine into his mouth. The inexactness of the control mechanic makes her arm flail awkwardly, like a sort of dating version of <a href=\"https://www.surgeonsim.com/\">Surgeon Simulator</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f597033d81bb578a5348507c11c8346f9796d17\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f597033d81bb578a5348507c11c8346f9796d17/0_39_2880_1728/1000.jpg\" alt=\"We Met in May\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Back to mine \u2026 Nina takes Jake to her flat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: We Met in May</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The final two feel like they\u2019re set slightly later in the relationship. Strike a Pose sees the couple going to the mall, where Nina tries on a range of outfits. In a funny reference to the magical attacks in role-playing games, each item of clothing empowers her with different abilities with which she quite literally stuns her waiting boyfriend when she emerges from the cubicle. Finally, Dinner\u2019s Ready has Jake fixing Nina dinner, while she idly fantasises about tweaking his nipples, an action the player takes over via a first-person-shooter-style aiming cursor.</p> <p>Along the way, there are snippets of cute interactive dialogue and we often see Nina\u2019s thought bubbles as she combats her insecurities and uncertainties. There is a lovely, pastel-shaded comic book wash to the visuals, an aesthetic that reminded me of 1970s girls\u2019 comics such as Jinty and Bunty. The soundtrack by Ryan Yoshikami has a relaxing, muzak vibe to it that underlines the playfulness and ephemeral nature of early romance, when everything feels silly and lightweight but also loaded with significance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cecf075ccb753157b2a2832386681543d7b1c1a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cecf075ccb753157b2a2832386681543d7b1c1a5/0_11_2874_1726/1000.jpg\" alt=\"We Met in May\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Power dressing \u2026 We Met in May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: We Met in May</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We Met in May is done in an hour, but like Freeman\u2019s other explorations of self-conscious longing and ardour, it lingers in the mind. The brief vignettes tap into memories we all share \u2013 of first dates and fumbled physical contact, of building shared jokes and memories, of just really fancying someone but not quite having the lexical or physical vocabulary to express it.</p> <p>That is the beauty of We Met in May. While playing Beach Date, I was trying to pour wine on Jake\u2019s shorts but ended up accidentally dropping the bottle, and the action became an affectionate stroke of his chest. It was a moment of unintended but electric intimacy that made the small asking price of this experimental project more than worth it.</p>",

Strike a Pose sees the couple going to the mall, where Nina tries on a range of outfits. In a funny reference to the magical attacks in role-playing games, each item of clothing empowers her with different abilities with which she quite literally stuns her waiting boyfriend when she emerges from the cubicle. Finally, Dinner\u2019s Ready has Jake fixing Nina dinner, while she idly fantasises about tweaking his nipples, an action the player takes over via a first-person-shooter-style aiming cursor. Along the way, there are snippets of cute interactive dialogue and we often see Nina\u2019s thought bubbles as she combats her insecurities and uncertainties. There is a lovely, pastel-shaded comic book wash to the visuals, an aesthetic that reminded me of 1970s girls\u2019 comics such as Jinty and Bunty. The soundtrack by Ryan Yoshikami has a relaxing, muzak vibe to it that underlines the playfulness and ephemeral nature of early romance, when everything feels silly and lightweight but also loaded with significance. We Met in May is done in an hour, but like Freeman\u2019s other explorations of self-conscious longing and ardour, it lingers in the mind. The brief vignettes tap into memories we all share \u2013 of first dates and fumbled physical contact, of building shared jokes and memories, of just really fancying someone but not quite having the lexical or physical vocabulary to express it. That is the beauty of We Met in May. While playing Beach Date, I was trying to pour wine on Jake\u2019s shorts but ended up accidentally dropping the bottle, and the action became an affectionate stroke of his chest. It was a moment of unintended but electric intimacy that made the small asking price of this experimental project more than worth it.",

      "bodyText": "On sunny afternoons, Yang takes his wheelchair-bound 90-year-old mother out along the Yu River, a canal near their home in Beijing\u2019s historic Gulou neighbourhood. In the autumn, willow trees sweep their branches in the water, and the place gives the impression of a lazy, golden city from the last imperial days. Gulou, often called the heart of old Beijing, is one of the only areas left that still have the city\u2019s ancient winding alleyways, or hutongs. Yang and his mother live in Yu\u2019er hutong, which lies just off the well-known and tourist-packed Nanluogu Xiang pedestrian street and is a short stroll from the ancient Drum and Bell Towers once used to tell the time across the city. Yu\u2019er is still largely home to the remnants of the working-class families who moved in during the mid-20th century and many of the houses lack proper plumbing \u2013 the residents use communal public bathrooms instead. Yang, who moved back in to take care of his ailing mother, always thought that, like her, he would grow old in Yu\u2019er hutong. But Yu\u2019er is part of the Four Hutongs project, a municipal campaign to renovate four historic alleyways near Nanluogu Xiang, and work is accelerating as the scheme approaches its end-of-year deadline. Yang\u2019s dream of growing old here is looking increasingly unlikely. Four Hutongs is part of a city-wide campaign to beautify and modernise Beijing, including tearing down unauthorised structures, renovating for fire safety and accessibility, and decreasing the population of China\u2019s capital city to 23 million by 2020. Whole historic neighbourhoods have received drastic facelifts. In the months leading up to the 2008 Olympics, the historic Qianmen/Dashilar neighbourhoods to the south of the Forbidden City palace were demolished and rebuilt into a shiny shopping area. Dashilar remains popular with visitors but is largely mourned by locals for its \u201csoulless, modern replicas\u201d of old Beijing. This isn\u2019t the first time Gulou has felt the heat. In 2010 the area was designated to be completely demolished to make way for Beijing Time Cultural City \u2013 an underground museum and shopping complex. The plan faced a severe backlash, from the Beijing Cultural Heritage Protection Center among others, and was put on hold indefinitely by city authorities. The areas around Yu\u2019er already suffer from what is colloquially known as the \u201cGreat Brickening\u201d \u2013 in which businesses in the hutongs are forced to shut down awaiting development and storefronts are bricked up. The Four Hutongs project is different. It is not a large-scale demolition and transformation like the 2010 proposal, and in contrast to the Great Brickening, it concerns residential rather than commercial properties. But by tearing down unauthorised housing and building sounder and more accessible structures, it inevitably raises real estate prices in an area that was previously untouched due to long-established occupancy. Although the four hutongs won\u2019t be replaced by modern shopping malls or concrete high-rises, the renovated homes can be turned into recreational spaces, private clubs or expensive courtyard houses. \u2018The city is still growing\u2019 Many longtime residents wonder what this gentrification means for them. Zhou, who is in his late 60s, grew up in Yu\u2019er hutong with his parents and six siblings in a one-room house with a lean-to kitchen. In 1969, as a teenager, he was sent to live in Jilin province under Mao Zedong\u2019s \u201cre-education\u201d programme. He didn\u2019t make it back to Beijing until the 1990s. \u201cSo much of what wasn\u2019t city is now city, and it\u2019s still growing,\u201d he says, shaking his head in disbelief. Zhou now lives with his dog in the old one-roomed family home that used to house nine people. Unlike Yang\u2019s side of the hutong, Zhou\u2019s area isn\u2019t being completely torn down \u2013 instead, he and his neighbours will be offered the choice to move back in after renovations. Others are being offered apartments in high-rise superblocks on the outer edges of the city or monetary compensation in proportion to the square footage of their current homes. More than 400 of 662 households have registered to move out, many happy enough with a move to higher-quality housing that would otherwise not be possible given Beijing\u2019s inflated real estate prices. But some are intimidated. Changing lifestyles so late in life is daunting for elderly people who have lived in one-storey houses their whole lives, they say, and they would miss the intimate communal feel of the hutongs. As demolitions start around them, others find they can\u2019t move out even if they want to. Yang fears his mother\u2019s condition is too fragile. Zhou, due to his time away from Beijing, has a bureaucratic hurdle: the house is not in his name because his family formalised the document when he was in Jilin. Zhou lights a cigarette and leans back in his chair. Just outside the door is his family\u2019s aged dingxiang tree. He recalls how his parents used to yell at his friends if any of them picked the fragrant white flowers. \u201cHalf of it\u2019s dead,\u201d he says, pointing out a cluster of gnarled, empty branches. \u201cBut that part\u201d \u2013 he points to the other half, which holds a number of blossoms \u2013 \u201cthat half is still alive.\u201d For now, at least.

And on Tuesday, it was reported that a Universal Orlando Resort employee <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/01/universal-orlando-resort-fires-despicable-me-actor-after-ok-symbol/3791483002/?fbclid=IwAR1U3ohtsBrCUimGCD9yygwDEpGwjQnr23gsLdwJgxnUY_SEgu4gWSRGUJs\">was </a><a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/01/universal-orlando-resort-fires-despicable-me-actor-after-ok-symbol/3791483002/?fbclid=IwAR1U3ohtsBrCUimGCD9yygwDEpGwjQnr23gsLdwJgxnUY_SEgu4gWSRGUJs\">fired</a> after concerned parents found a photo of him making the hand sign on their six-year-old\u2019s shoulder (their child is biracial and has autism).</p> <p>The OK sign joins a number of surprising symbols co-opted by the alt-right, such as the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://theconversation.com/how-the-alt-right-uses-milk-to-promote-white-supremacy-94854&amp;sa=D&amp;source=hangouts&amp;ust=1570112422138000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGu1vVLhW5PgbUzM7HrkCts-vSDzQ\">milk emoji</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-pepe-the-frog-became-a-nazi-trump-supporter-and-alt-right-symbol\">Pepe the frog</a> and even, at one point, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2016/05/27/479462825/taylor-swift-aryan-goddess\">Taylor Swift</a>.</p> <p>Sometimes, trolls\u2019 choices are far-fetched and innocuous \u2013 the milk emoji was appropriated because of the allegedly superior ability of white people to drink milk (large numbers of people in the rest of the world are <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/lactose-intolerance%23statistics&amp;sa=D&amp;source=hangouts&amp;ust=1570113675167000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEu-CniRSU8qrzOah85uFPKPVmYFg\">lactose intolerant</a>). But the transformation of mundane symbols into something to be feared is part of a broader aim to garner media attention, and getting one up on the people they think they\u2019re fooling.</p> <p>\u201cReporters don\u2019t always understand that [trolls] seek media attention \u2013 when they see something get media uptake, they capitalise on it,\u201d says Dr Joan Donovan, a media manipulation expert who is the director of Harvard\u2019s <a href=\"https://shorensteincenter.org/about-us/areas-of-focus/technology-social-change/\">Technology and Social Change (TaSC) Research Project</a>.</p> <p>She explains how these media manipulators see an opportunity \u2013 for example, when something goes viral or becomes popular \u2013 and choose it as a moment to insert themselves into the conversation. In the case of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2017/feb/15/trash-dove-how-a-purple-bird-took-over-facebook\">Facebook \u201cTrash Doves\u201d sticker</a>, for example, 4chan users noticed the cartoon go viral and sent out the rallying cry: \u201cLet\u2019s make this normie meme a Nazi symbol!\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The trolls have a laugh when the journalists are fooled</p> <footer> <cite>Dr Joan Donovan</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>With this process, they flex their muscles, showing that what the Lord giveth, the alt-right can take away. And it\u2019s done through elaborate means, too: with Trash Doves, 4chan-users began to photoshop swastikas on to the viral Facebook cartoon. Sometimes they\u2019re even more sophisticated, creating fake content cards like that of the ADL\u2019s. They circulate the content online through social media, leaving it out as bait for undiscerning journalists who perpetuate the hoax by writing about it as if it is an authentic hate-threat.</p> <p>\u201cThis is their trick: they are hoping journalists will uncritically look at the OK symbol, find these infographics that claim it stands for white power and then write about it. The trolls have a laugh when the journalists are fooled,\u201d says Donovan.</p> <p>\u201cThese become symbols of hate pretty much exclusively because of journalistic coverage,\u201d says Wendy Phillips, who wrote <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/why-we-cant-have-nice-things\">This is Why We Can\u2019t Have Nice things: Mapping the Relationship between Online Trolling and Mainstream Culture</a>.</p> <p>Ultimately, this a game about power: if rightwing trolls can make the so-called liberal media look gullible, then it has a delegitimising effect, supporting the idea that journalists are oversensitive, easily triggered snowflakes. Soon enough, the news begins to feels like it belongs to a parody website rather than real life.</p> <p>\u201cWhat memes do is they create in-groups and out-groups. The in-groups know it\u2019s satirical, the out-groups think it\u2019s something to fear,\u201d says Donovan. \ufeff</p> <p>Part of the effect is to make you think that white supremacists could be everywhere, hiding in plain sight. If someone as important as the president could be one of them \u2013 Trump <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-ocasio-cortez-hand-gesture-860776/\">likes to flash the gesture</a> when he speaks \u2013 who else is?

      "bodyText": "Another day, another seemingly harmless symbol you can\u2019t use without appearing to be a purveyor of hate. The alt-right\u2019s latest trophy is the OK hand sign, which was officially recognised as a hate symbol by the Anti-Defamation League over the weekend. And on Tuesday, it was reported that a Universal Orlando Resort employee was fired after concerned parents found a photo of him making the hand sign on their six-year-old\u2019s shoulder (their child is biracial and has autism). The OK sign joins a number of surprising symbols co-opted by the alt-right, such as the milk emoji, Pepe the frog and even, at one point, Taylor Swift. Sometimes, trolls\u2019 choices are far-fetched and innocuous \u2013 the milk emoji was appropriated because of the allegedly superior ability of white people to drink milk (large numbers of people in the rest of the world are lactose intolerant). But the transformation of mundane symbols into something to be feared is part of a broader aim to garner media attention, and getting one up on the people they think they\u2019re fooling. \u201cReporters don\u2019t always understand that [trolls] seek media attention \u2013 when they see something get media uptake, they capitalise on it,\u201d says Dr Joan Donovan, a media manipulation expert who is the director of Harvard\u2019s Technology and Social Change (TaSC) Research Project. She explains how these media manipulators see an opportunity \u2013 for example, when something goes viral or becomes popular \u2013 and choose it as a moment to insert themselves into the conversation. In the case of the Facebook \u201cTrash Doves\u201d sticker, for example, 4chan users noticed the cartoon go viral and sent out the rallying cry: \u201cLet\u2019s make this normie meme a Nazi symbol!\u201d With this process, they flex their muscles, showing that what the Lord giveth, the alt-right can take away. And it\u2019s done through elaborate means, too: with Trash Doves, 4chan-users began to photoshop swastikas on to the viral Facebook cartoon. Sometimes they\u2019re even more sophisticated, creating fake content cards like that of the ADL\u2019s. They circulate the content online through social media, leaving it out as bait for undiscerning journalists who perpetuate the hoax by writing about it as if it is an authentic hate-threat. \u201cThis is their trick: they are hoping journalists will uncritically look at the OK symbol, find these infographics that claim it stands for white power and then write about it. The trolls have a laugh when the journalists are fooled,\u201d says Donovan. \u201cThese become symbols of hate pretty much exclusively because of journalistic coverage,\u201d says Wendy Phillips, who wrote This is Why We Can\u2019t Have Nice things: Mapping the Relationship between Online Trolling and Mainstream Culture. Ultimately, this a game about power: if rightwing trolls can make the so-called liberal media look gullible, then it has a delegitimising effect, supporting the idea that journalists are oversensitive, easily triggered snowflakes. Soon enough, the news begins to feels like it belongs to a parody website rather than real life. \u201cWhat memes do is they create in-groups and out-groups. The in-groups know it\u2019s satirical, the out-groups think it\u2019s something to fear,\u201d says Donovan. \ufeff Part of the effect is to make you think that white supremacists could be everywhere, hiding in plain sight. If someone as important as the president could be one of them \u2013 Trump likes to flash the gesture when he speaks \u2013 who else is? Heck, maybe you\u2019re a white supremacist, because the last time you sent an OK emoji you were unwittingly signalling your belief in the superiority of the white race. At some point, life begins to imitate their art, and what began as a media hoax takes on dangerously radical connotations. This point came when the Australian man charged with killing 51 people at mosques in New Zealand, made the OK gesture during a courtroom appearance after being arrested. Phillips says even if stories written about these memes are incredulous or mocking, they might help the cause, since media attention is what those groups are after. \u201cMany of us tend to be very fascinated in the bad guys themselves which is understandable but they are the smallest part of the story,\u201d she says. So what does this mean for journalists? Phillips argues that media organisations can\u2019t ever truly separate themselves from the amplification of white nationalists if they have to report on them. Instead, she advocates for the media to shift the camera away from the white supremacists and focus on its real victims. That means looking at its impact on minority communities in places like Texas, and on the people who live in the small towns that neo-Nazis turn up in. It means highlighting the toxic resentment of women that the patriarchal ideology of white nationalism results in, and what it feels like for a mother to have white supremacists take her daughter away. Ultimately, it means reporting the news but in a different way, says Phillips: \u201cI don\u2019t think the media shouldn\u2019t tell the truth, you should just tell a bigger truth: about the impact of these behaviours, instead of just reporting on the genesis of them.\u201d",

Mrs Justice Roberts ruled that the man, who has autism with impaired cognition and lives in a supported residential placement, has a \u201cfundamental right to sex\u201d. The court considers issues relating to people who might lack the mental capacity to make decisions. A clinical psychologist submitted a report saying that the 36-year-old man, referred to as JB, represents a \u201cmoderate risk\u201d of sexual offending to women, particularly to those who are vulnerable, and that JB cannot understand that a woman\u2019s consent is relevant in sexual situations, nor that attempting sex without consent is likely to be a criminal offence. However, the judge said that insisting that JB understands the issue of consent before being allowed to pursue sexual relationships would be discrimination because it would \u201cimpose on him a burden which a capacitous individual may not share\u201d. She said not having that knowledge might result in criminal prosecution but JB was \u201centitled to make the same mistakes which all human beings can, and do, make in the course of a lifetime\u201d. JB has never been charged with any criminal offence but because of his behaviour towards women he has been subject to a care plan by his local authority since 2014 which has imposed significant limitations on his freedoms.

      "bodyText": "As autumn creeps in, porridge is once again what mornings call for. It is the perfect breakfast. It fills you up, it keeps you warm. It\u2019s quick to make and, tastewise, it can go in many directions. You can add nuts and dried fruit, honey and cream, banana and Nutella; or you can go savoury, with seeds, cheese, harissa, bacon, soft-boiled eggs or spring onions. But porridge does not stop with oats, which is good news for anyone scarred by a childhood of lumpy grey gloop. The world over, you find cereal grains and starchy plants chopped, ground, rolled or otherwise processed and boiled in water (or milk, or stock) until they release their starches and thicken into something creamy. Technically even risotto and congee qualify as types of porridge. (A political analyst called Abigail Pile ushered in 2019 by writing a 1,250-word essay on how to stir your porridge. She took cues from the traditional risotto method \u2013 use water, don\u2019t stop stirring and get yourself one of those wooden rods that the Scots call spurtles.)

The climbing tower is 12 metres high and each side has a different level of difficulty. There is archery, a zipline and Go Ape too, offering high-wire forest thrills. The Forest of Dean family cycle trail goes through here \u2013 its circular nine-mile trail is a beautiful off-road ride for all ages. There is a huge play area with wooden and modern rides, frames, tunnels and bridges. The sculpture trail begins here, as does the Zog trail, (an activity route based on the book by Julia Donaldson and Alex Scheffler). There are barbecue pits and open spaces for football and games and the cafe is brilliant. We stayed at Hidden Valley Yurts and spent a lovely day here this summer. \u2022 forestryengland.uk Laura Jenkins Plas-y-Brenin, Snowdonia This centre in Snowdonia national park is next to the lake Llynnau Mymbyr and is superbly located for places to kayak, climb, cycle and hike. Instructors and excellent facilities make it a great base for getting the most out of the area on one of its multi-day courses. Paddlers can choose from beginner and special skills courses in white-water kayaking, gentle canoeing and sea kayaking. Onsite accommodation is comfortable and the breathtaking view of the Snowdon horseshoe from the Yr Wyddfa bar makes a meal and a pint of beer a great end to an active day. \u2022 Courses two to seven days from \u00a3200, accommodation from \u00a335pn, pyb.co.uk Annie O\u2019Connor Greenhill, County Down My family had a great week\u2019s holiday in Newcastle. YMCA Greenhill is set in National Trust-owned land in the foothills of the Mourne mountains. We dropped our kids into the YMCA for the week, where they had the time of their lives doing bouldering, climbing, canoeing, laser tag, etc. This enabled us to explore an area that has so much on its doorstep: Murlough (the first nature reserve in all of Ireland, set up in 1967) with its 6,000-year-old-dune system , multiple forest parks, walks in the spectacular Mournes, mountain-biking and beaches. Newcastle has a good range of accommodation and food options. \u2022 Organised groups only, minimum of eight, camping and dormitories available, greenhill-ymca.org Andrew McAleavey G2 Activity Centre, Cairngorms This summer, I spent a day canyoning with a group of friends. We started at G2\u2019s HQ just south of Aviemore, where we picked up wetsuits and helmets then drove to the Bruar canyon, 50 minutes to the south and joined our guides. Here, amid pine forest and the constant sound of rushing water, we discovered the thrills of natural water slides over bare rocks, abseiling through waterfalls and leaping into deep rock pools. I was a bit apprehensive about the trip to be honest but I couldn\u2019t have had a more thrilling time. G2 also offers ziplining, gorge walking, rafting and skiing. \u2022 \u00a360pp for five-hour trip, minimum age 13, g2outdoor.co.uk Kimmich Peak District I\u2019ve been to the Peak District many times, walking, cycling and fishing. But I\u2019d never been into the Peaks before. Boiler-suited, hard-hatted groups emerging from some roadside hole wet, muddy and happy are a common sight in these parts. I now know why. A caving taster day with local outfit Pure Outdoor was brilliant, with our guide coaxing us to slither, wriggle and squeeze like worms through serpentine passages, while learning about the local geology. SteveP Boulder Hut, Cheshire This place in Ellesmere Port has a fantastic newish bouldering wall for all ages and levels and also offers slacklining (similar to tightrope walking) and soft archery. It has a great community feel, everyone is incredibly supportive and kind, and there is a great range of routes for all abilities. There is also the bonus of regular events, like 1980s nights and Halloween parties and competitions. It\u2019s a place where children are welcome and everyone can have fun together.

I\u2019m Martin Farrer and it\u2019s my pleasure to bring you the top stories from the Guardian this Thursday.</p> \n<p>Boris Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/02/boris-johnson-unveils-brexit-plan-for-alternative-to-backstop\">faces an uphill battle to convince the EU</a> that his proposals for an alternative to the Irish border backstop will be enough to enable Britain to leave the bloc with a deal on 31 October. Although Brussels wants to avoid trashing Johnson\u2019s plans in public, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, privately gave a scathing analysis of the proposal the PM set out at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/02/conservative-party-conference-five-things-we-learned\">Tory party conference</a> yesterday, describing it as a trap. Johnson spoke to European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker yesterday as well as the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, who warned that the legal texts tabled \u201cdo not fully meet the agreed objectives of the backstop\u201d. The PM will update the cabinet on his discussions when it meets today but the muted EU reaction will be a blow to Johnson after his rousing speech in which he pledged to take Britain out at the end of the month<strong> </strong>with or without a deal. There was some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/02/mps-voice-cautious-support-for-johnsons-irish-border-proposals\">cautious support from MPs for his plan</a> but if the plan is rejected by the EU, the government appears set for another clash with Parliament after the Benn Act outlawed a no-deal Brexit last month.</p> \n<p>Our columnists are unimpressed.

Elijah Cummings, the chair of the House oversight committee, said it would subpoena the White House to release key documents on the administration\u2019s contacts with Ukraine by Friday. Trump, who live tweeted a Democratic media conference, called the inquiry \u201cBULLSHIT\u201d and later repeated the claim that House intelligence chairman Adam Schiff should be investigated for treason.

Boris Johnson faces an uphill battle to convince the EU that his proposals for an alternative to the Irish border backstop will be enough to enable Britain to leave the bloc with a deal on 31 October. Although Brussels wants to avoid trashing Johnson\u2019s plans in public, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, privately gave a scathing analysis of the proposal the PM set out at Tory party conference yesterday, describing it as a trap.

There was some cautious support from MPs for his plan but if the plan is rejected by the EU, the government appears set for another clash with Parliament after the Benn Act outlawed a no-deal Brexit last month. Our columnists are unimpressed. Martin Kettle calls Johnson\u2019s speech \u201ccowardly\u201d while Marina Hyde writes that the Tories \u201cleft no fantasy untouched\u201d. George Monbiot advances a broader argument that politicians such as Johnson are using the language of violence to dominate discourse, while poet laureate Simon Armitage argues that our leaders\u2019 words are \u201cshallow and threadbare\u201d. * * * Whisky scotched \u2013 The Trump administration has imposed 25% tariffs on scotch whisky and hundreds of other European agricultural products as well as 10% on aircraft in a significant widening of its trade dispute with the EU. The tariffs could come into effect as early as 18 October and are worth a total of $7.5bn. The list of goods also includes British knitwear, French cheese and wine, Spanish olives and industrial products such as microwaves and camera parts. The US move, which followed a WTO ruling that the EU had given aerospace company Airbus unfair subsidies, spooked investors in Asia where shares fell sharply, compounding losses in the US and Europe yesterday. * * * Trump tantrum \u2013 The battle over the impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump has intensified after Democratic party lawmakers warned the president \u201cwe\u2019re not fooling around\u201d and accused him of trying to intimidate witnesses. Elijah Cummings, the chair of the House oversight committee, said it would subpoena the White House to release key documents on the administration\u2019s contacts with Ukraine by Friday. Trump, who live tweeted a Democratic media conference, called the inquiry \u201cBULLSHIT\u201d and later repeated the claim that House intelligence chairman Adam Schiff should be investigated for treason. He also found time to have a furious row with a Reuters reporter at a White House media conference, replying to a question with an aggressive: \u201cAre you talking to me?\u201d. Our Washington correspondent, David Smith, sums up the day by saying Trump had a \u201cfull-blown impeachment tantrum\u201d. * * * Gold star \u2013 British sport has a new female superstar after Dina Asher-Smith became the first woman from these shores to win a world sprint title, when she took gold in the 200m at the World Athletics Championships in Doha. The University of London history graduate powered home well clear of her rivals in 21.88 seconds and now targets another gold in the 4x100m at the weekend. She will then focus on next year\u2019s Olympics in Tokyo and promises there is \u201cmore to come\u201d. She faces competition as the standout British athlete, however, as Katarina Johnson-Thompson goes into the final day of the heptathlon in the gold medal position. * * * Arcuri denials \u2013 Jennifer Arcuri, the American tech entrepreneur at the centre of a political row over her friendship with Boris Johnson, has broken her silence to deny allegations that the PM helped her receive business grants and a visa. The businesswoman, who lives in Los Angeles, was quoted in an article by the Daily Mail saying she was the victim of an \u201corchestrated attack\u201d by the media. \u201cAll the allegations are false,\u201d she said, telling the paper that grants of \u00a3126,000 of public money she received for her firm, Innotech, had been awarded appropriately. * * * Healing hug \u2013 A prosecutor in Dallas has described an \u201camazing act of healing\u201d after the brother of Botham Jean, a black man shot dead in his own home, forgave and hugged his killer, a white former policewoman. \u201cI love you just like anyone else,\u201d Brandt Jean told Amber Guyger in the courtroom after she was sentenced to 10 years for the killing. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say I hope you rot and die just like my brother did, but I personally want the best for you.\u201d He then embraced her before the judge walked over to Guyger, opened a Bible to John 3:16 and said: \u201cThis is where you start.\u201d Then they also hugged.

Non-fiction highlights include Labour MP Jess Phillips writing about \u201ccalling time on BS\u201d in her book Truth to Power, along with memoirs from Lenny Henry, Wham!\u2019s Andrew Ridgeley and David Suchet. Sport Eddie Jones has resisted the temptation to restore the fit-again Mako Vunipola and Jack Nowell into his starting XV to face Argentina on Saturday but both are set to make their comebacks from the bench. Liverpool raced to an early 3-0 lead in their Champions League encounter with RB Salzburg but were pegged back in the second half before Mo Salah scored the winner to secure a 4-3 win on a wild night at Anfield. In France, Tammy Abraham scored on his 22nd birthday and Willian supplied a decisive volley as Chelsea won 2-1 at Lille. David Pemsel, the incoming chief executive at the Premier League, has plenty to work on when he takes up the reins, writes Paul McInnes. Tom Morgan will face charges under the British Horseracing Authority\u2019s anti-corruption rules at a disciplinary inquiry today which could lead to a ban from the sport of up to 10 years. And UK Athletics is facing calls for an inquiry into how much influence the banned coach Alberto Salazar, who mentored Mo Farah for more than six years, has had on athletes in its endurance programme. Business The City will be braced for more losses today after Washington\u2019s announcement of tariffs on a range of British and continental goods did little to calm nerves shredded by a week of poor economic data from the US.

      "bodyText": "The UK government should pay reparations to Wales for stripping it of its natural resources and \u201cdepriving it of its inheritance\u201d, the leader of Plaid Cymru has said ahead of the party\u2019s annual conference. Writing before the start of the two-day event on Friday, in Swansea, Adam Price said being governed from Westminster had left Wales unable to fulfil its potential and called for a Welsh reconstruction fund to \u201csettle up\u201d for a century of lost time. \u201cThrough the long lens of our nation\u2019s history we see a once resource-rich country ground down into crippling poverty,\u201d said the Welsh nationalist leader in a comment piece seen by the Guardian. \u201cToday it\u2019s not charity we seek but justice. British rule in Wales has left deep scars. No, it may not have been so bloody, but the human cost in blighted lives is to be measured in the millions. \u201cThe sun at one time never set on the British Empire \u2013 but in the underground of the coalfield it never even dawned. Deprived of our inheritance we were left without the tools \u2013 the levers and pulleys \u2013 with which to prise ourselves out of the rut of poverty.\u201d The conference comes at the end of a week in which opposition parties in Westminster attempted to work together to draw up a strategy to stop Boris Johnson taking the UK out of the EU without a deal. Plaid\u2019s Liz Saville Roberts, one of the party\u2019s four MPs, was among the opposition leaders participating in the talks. Wales voted to leave Europe by a margin of 52.5% to 47.5% in the 2016 referendum but Plaid has positioned itself as a party for remain voters, pledging to campaign to cancel Brexit in an election. The Brexit party won 19 out of 22 council areas in Wales in the European elections in May, with Plaid overtaking Labour to win second place. The issue of reparations for the west\u2019s colonial past has attracted increased attention in recent years, with both institutions and governments under pressure to atone for past wrongs. In August Glasgow University agreed to give \u00a320m to fund a joint research centre with the University of the West Indies, to make amends for its historical links to the transatlantic slave trade. The US Congress debated the question of whether reparations should be paid to the descendants of slaves for the first time in June, while the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said at last week\u2019s party conference that a future Labour government would make reparations for Britain\u2019s colonial past. \u201cThe argument that the British Empire owes reparations to the people of its former colonies is powerfully well-made by the Indian politician Shashi Tharoor,\u201d said Price. \u201cBut England\u2019s first colony should be added to that long list of creditors.\u201d He pointed to the decision to flood the rural community of Capel Celyn in 1965 to create a reservoir to supply Liverpool and Wirral with water for industry. \u201cWe can\u2019t rebuild the village of Capel Celyn, but we can rebuild our country. We need a new sense of hope and a National Reconstruction Fund to finance it,\u201d he said. \u201cConsider this \u2013 Wales is the fifth largest exporter of electricity in the world, placed above energy-rich Norway and its $1tn sovereign wealth fund built on surpluses for its energy policy. \u201cAnd yet there are factories in Wales with full order books that cannot expand simply because they cannot afford to connect to the National Grid whose patchy footprint means in Wales its very name is something of a fiction.\u201d The Plaid leader concluded by quoting the Welsh rugby player Phil Bennett: \u201cThey\u2019ve taken our coal, our water, our steel \u2026 What have they given us?

      "body": "<p>In 2010, the small community of specialists who pay attention to US road safety statistics picked up the first signs of a troubling trend: more and more pedestrians were being killed on American roads. That year, 4,302 American pedestrians died, an increase of almost 5% from 2009. The tally has increased almost every year since, with particularly sharp spikes in 2015 and 2016. Last year, 41% more US pedestrians were killed than in 2008. During this same period, overall non-pedestrian road fatalities moved in the opposite direction, decreasing by more than 7%. For drivers, roads are as safe as they have ever been; for people on foot, roads keep getting deadlier.</p> <p>Through the 90s and 00s, the pedestrian death count had declined almost every year. No one would have confused the US for a walkers\u2019 paradise \u2013 at least part of the reason fewer pedestrians died in this period was that people were driving more and walking less, which meant that there were fewer opportunities to be struck. But at least the death toll was shrinking. The fact that, globally, pedestrian fatalities were much more common in poorer countries made it possible to view pedestrian death as part of an unfortunate, but temporary, stage of development: growing pains on the road to modernity, destined to decrease eventually as a matter of course. The US road death statistics of the last decade have blasted a hole in that theory. (A similar trend has been observed with regards to the country\u2019s cyclists: a recent analysis found that cyclist fatalities decreased through the 80s, 90s and 00s, but since 2010 have increased 25%, with 777 cyclists killed in 2017.)</p> <p>Trouble, albeit of a less dramatic sort, has also been brewing in the UK and western European countries, long seen as bastions of pedestrian-friendly (and cyclist-friendly) conditions. Through the 70s and 80s, these countries\u2019 fatality rates were just as bad as America\u2019s, or worse. But, since then, their progress has been more substantial and more enduring. The problem is that, since 2010, that progress has mostly sputtered to a halt. In general, the fatality numbers are not going down. \u201cThere\u2019s immense frustration,\u201d says Philip Gomm, of the RAC Foundation, a UK organisation that studies road safety issues. \u201cThings were getting better, and now they\u2019re not.\u201d</p> <p>In almost every country in the world, regardless of national prosperity, it remains on average more dangerous, per mile of travel, to be a pedestrian than to be a car driver or passenger. Worldwide, more than 700 pedestrians die every day, disproportionately in poorer countries. At least four times that number are seriously injured. We talk a great deal about how cars congest our cities and pollute the atmosphere. We talk less about how they keep killing and maiming people simply trying to get from A to B on two feet.</p> <p>Lately, our cultural conversation about road safety has been dominated by visions, sold by Silicon Valley, of vehicles that minimise or even eliminate the need for input from a fallible human driver. Every year, more cars come armed with \u201cpedestrian detection and avoidance\u201d systems; soon, these systems will likely be standard issue. And not long after that, we are promised, sensors and self-improving algorithms will take over the driving process altogether, eliminating human error from roads and ushering in a new golden age of safety for all their users, whether or not they\u2019re cocooned by a car\u2019s steel frame. Since 2017, General Motors, the US\u2019s largest car manufacturer, has claimed that it is developing self-driving vehicles in the service of a \u201ctriple-zero\u201d world: zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"37d40ed89ea2d58f239da110fac3bf4ac570b50b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/37d40ed89ea2d58f239da110fac3bf4ac570b50b/81_206_2791_1675/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Google self-driving car in Silicon Valley.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Google self-driving car in Silicon Valley.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ddp USA/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The possibility of making pedestrians safer is a welcome one, not least because walking is so undeniably good. Walking boosts physical and mental health, draws communities together and produces no carbon emissions. But there are good reasons to be sceptical about the promises made by the proselytisers of the high-tech car future. Car companies swear they are here to help \u2013 by selling us products that hardly ever hit anyone or anything. But the truth is that this promise is, at best, a distraction. In fact, much of our discourse around cars, self-driving or otherwise, is less about transforming the status quo than maintaining it, obscuring paths to progress exactly when we need them most, and leaving pedestrians right in the line of fire.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Ask a room full of road safety experts what is causing pedestrian fatalities to increase and most will admit that, well, they are not exactly sure. Every time a car hits a pedestrian, it represents the intersection of a vast number of variables. At the level of those involved, there is the question of who is distracted, reckless, drunk. Zooming out, there are factors such as the design and condition of the road, the quality (or absence) of a marked pedestrian crossing, the speed limit, the local lighting, the weight and height of the car involved. In a crash, all these variables and more converge at high speed in real-world, non-laboratory conditions that make it hard to isolate the influence of each variable.</p> <p>Attempting to explain a trend \u2013 to correctly apportion blame not for one but thousands of pedestrian deaths \u2013 adds yet more layers of complexity. Economic and employment trends, the availability and quality of public transport, shifts in the age of walkers and drivers: it all matters. Disentangling the threads in a scientifically rigorous way is fiendishly difficult. \u201cThere are multiple theories about how to account for what is happening,\u201d says Norman Garrick, a University of Connecticut professor who studies road safety. \u201cWe know something radically new is going on. But I don\u2019t think we have an exact answer yet.\u201d</p> <p>Ask that same room of road safety experts a slightly different question \u2013 not exactly why US pedestrians fatalities have risen lately, but instead why the US has more of them than any other wealthy country \u2013 and the answers will come flooding out. In recent months, after conversations with more than a dozen such experts, I became familiar with a particular tone of voice: deep frustration at how obvious it all is, but wrapped in a package of professional cheeriness. \u201cWell, where to start?\u201d says Eric Dumbaugh of Florida Atlantic University. \u201cSo much of it is relatively simple, which makes the lack of progress that much more aggravating.\u201d</p> <p>Here is what the frustrated safety experts will tell you: Americans are driving more than ever, more than residents of any other country. More of them than ever are living in cities and out in urban sprawl; a growing number of pedestrian fatalities occur on the fringes of cities, where high-volume, high-speed roads exist in close proximity to the places where people live, work, and shop. Speed limits have increased across the country over the past 20 years, despite robust evidence that even slight increases in speed dramatically increase the likelihood of killing pedestrians (car passengers, too \u2013 but the increase is not as steep, thanks to improvements in the design of car frames, airbags and seatbelts). American road engineers tend to assume people will speed, and so design roads to accommodate speeding; this, in turn, facilitates more speeding, which soon enough makes higher speed limits feel reasonable. And more Americans than ever are zipping around in SUVs and pickup trucks, which, thanks to their height, weight and shape are between two and three times more likely to kill people they hit. SUVs are also the most profitable cars on the market, for the simple reason buyers are willing to pay more for them. As with speeding, there appears to be a self-perpetuating cycle at work: the increased presence of large cars on the road makes them feel more dangerous, which makes owning a large car yourself feel more comforting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d11f145af07c57cdbdcc78093e57f5953c68bcb4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d11f145af07c57cdbdcc78093e57f5953c68bcb4/0_286_4996_2998/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The taillights of cars on a freeway in Los Angeles.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Los Angeles freeway: \u2018The US is the country in the world most shaped, physically and culturally, by the presumption that the uninterrupted flow of car traffic is an obvious public good.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00c9tienne Laurent/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>More fundamentally, the US is the country in the world most shaped, physically and culturally, by the presumption that the uninterrupted flow of car traffic is an obvious public good, one that deserves to trump all others in the road planning process. Many of its younger cities are designed almost entirely around planning paradigms in which pedestrians were either ignored or factored only as nuisances. Cars move fast and are heavy and hard; humans on foot move slower and are made of flesh and bone. \u201cThe layperson can realise, if they think about it for a minute, that if you want to keep people safe, you have to design streets differently,\u201d says Dumbaugh. \u201cYou have to slow the cars down. You have to recognise the reality of road users who aren\u2019t in cars. You have to design roads so people in cars take notice of their fellow road users. But these basic realisations aren\u2019t things the US transportation system knows or integrates into practice. And so people keep getting killed.\u201d</p> <p>While safety experts tend to focus on broad factors \u2013 the road environment and what types of behaviour it encourages \u2013 America\u2019s cultural discourse on road safety tends to go in the opposite direction, zooming in on that most American of variables: the individual. It is not cars, car culture or bad, car-centric planning that kill pedestrians. Instead, it is individuals making bad choices about how to use the roads.</p> <p>There is no greater symptom of this worldview than the recurring focus on mobile phones, especially smartphones and their tendency to monopolise our limited attention. Road signs warning against phone use while driving are so commonplace that they almost blend into the landscape. Parents make their kids promise they won\u2019t use their phones while driving. Kids nod and promise they won\u2019t. Phone-tracking studies indicate that most of them do it anyway and that their parents do, too.</p> <p>In recent years, America\u2019s fear of the distracted driver expanded to include the distracted walker. This is a replay of an old phenomenon: it was the US that invented the concept of the \u201cjaywalker\u201d, a \u201cjay\u201d being an unsophisticated person from the country who did not even know how to walk correctly. In the US, much like anywhere that cars have taken hold, drivers screaming at pedestrians (and cyclists) that they are doing it wrong is a fixture of national life. More recently, numerous states and cities, including San Francisco and New York, have launched public campaigns against inattentive walking, as has the US National Safety Council. Some jurisdictions have passed, or sought to pass, bills that would make using a smartphone while crossing the road an offence punishable by fine. On Twitter, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has weighed in on the pedestrian safety crisis primarily by coaching pedestrians on how to protect themselves. \u201cWhen you are walking, be predictable\u201d, advises <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nhtsagov\" title=\"\">@NHTSAgov</a>.</p> <p>Ask a room full of safety experts about smartphones and you will get a mix of resignation, bemusement and contempt. \u201cI tend not to buy the smartphone distraction stuff,\u201d says Garrick, echoing nearly identical comments from just about everyone I talked to. \u201cTo me, it reads as shoving aside actually dealing with the relevant issues.\u201d What particularly bothers him, he says, is how poorly thought out the distraction discourse tends to be. In the UK, Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Austria and Iceland, for example, pedestrian deaths occur at a per capita rate roughly half of America\u2019s, or lower. Are we really to believe that the citizens of these countries are 50% less susceptible than Americans to distraction, by their phones or anything else? Plus, within the US, pedestrian death occurs disproportionately in neighbourhoods populated by people with low-incomes and people of colour. Is distraction really more endemic in those neighbourhoods, or among people driving through them, than it is in wealthier, whiter areas? Or is it more likely that these neighbourhoods are more likely to be criss-crossed by high-speed roads, and less likely to receive investment in transit interventions that protect pedestrians?</p> <p>\u201cAll this talk about pedestrian distraction, driver distraction? It\u2019s such a distraction,\u201d says Ben Welle of the World Resource Institute for Sustainable Cities. \u201cIt puts all the responsibility on individuals, and none on the environment they operate in.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Over the past decade, as the American pedestrian\u2019s plight has worsened, global car manufacturers have stepped forward with news of a supposedly game-changing innovation, one that might at last improve the fate of those who want to travel on foot. This innovation has nothing to do with re-engineering roads, regulating SUV design, investing in public transit or any other intervention that would require using the creaky levers of democratic politics. Instead, people just have to buy new cars.</p> <p>In spring 2010, Volvo announced what sounded like the inauguration of a new era, one in which cars at last acknowledged pedestrians. Starting that autumn, anyone who bought a Volvo S60 saloon could, for an extra $2,100 (\u00a31,700), have it equipped with Pedestrian Detection, a radar-and-camera-based system designed to sense the presence of pedestrians in the car\u2019s path \u2013 and, if needed, automatically brake to avoid hitting them. An older variety of sensor, made available in 2005, had equipped some cars to sense pedestrian collisions while they were in progress and, in response, pop up their hoods a few inches, creating a \u201ccrumple zone\u201d between the bonnet and the hard machinery inside, making for a softer landing. But these systems had been sold only in Europe, and they did nothing to stop cars from hitting pedestrians in the first place, or slow them down in advance of the collision.</p> <p>Every year since Volvo Pedestrian Detection arrived on the market, systems like it \u2013 like all \u201cassistive driving\u201d features \u2013 have become more sophisticated and more common. As of last year, pedestrian-sensing technology is now standard on close to a third of new vehicles sold in the US, and available as an add-on for another third. In the EU, regulations passed earlier this year will make such systems mandatory on new cars starting in 2022. Their growing popularity is largely attributable to the relevant tech getting cheaper, but endorsements from trusted institutions have also played an important role. Since 2016, Europe\u2019s New Car Assessment Program, which issues influential annual rankings of vehicle safety, has awarded extra points to cars with pedestrian detection and avoidance systems. In the US, the well-respected Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has advocated the widespread adoption of pedestrian avoidance tools. Just this year, the nationally venerated American buyer\u2019s guide Consumer Reports announced that, for the first time, it would factor pedestrian avoidance into its ratings, in hopes of incentivising carmakers to help address rising pedestrian fatalities.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1e92f23d493c6a71d27c6298da924deb01c9135a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e92f23d493c6a71d27c6298da924deb01c9135a/0_135_3873_2325/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An illustration of self-driving cars\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An illustration of self-driving cars</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At first glance, this all sounds like a long-overdue corrective to the car-first chauvinism that has made American roads so deadly. But none of the safety experts I spoke to were terribly excited about pedestrian avoidance technology. It wasn\u2019t that they doubted it might save some pedestrian lives. Instead, their recurring concern was that it reflects an ongoing focus on individual shortcomings \u2013 on flawed drivers and walkers \u2013 and a neglect of flaws built in to the roads they are forced to use.</p> <p>\u201cPedestrian detection will probably help a bit,\u201d says Dan Albert, author of <a href=\"https://www.danalbert.com/\" title=\"\">Are We There Yet?</a>, a history of American car culture. \u201cBut at the same time, it\u2019s pretty clear that these problems can be addressed without hi-tech solutions. And so what are the car companies up to? It\u2019s not just about some altruistic desire for safety, or they would be including these systems on all of their cars, which very few companies are doing. It\u2019s more about creating a range of products that allows them to maximise profit.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.iihs.org/news/detail/new-studies-highlight-driver-confusion-about-automated-systems\" title=\"\">Recent studies have found that</a> high percentages of <a href=\"https://www.nsc.org/Portals/0/Documents/NewsDocuments/2017/Driver-Safety-Poll.pdf?ver=2018-03-09-132446-750\" title=\"\">drivers</a> do not <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/01/25/688383794/a-safety-feature-by-any-other-name-can-really-be-confusing-aaa-finds?t=1570029845960\" title=\"\">understand exactly what these new systems do</a>. I recently rented a car armed with sensors to help you stay in your lane, sensors to detect other cars and sensors to detect pedestrians; for four days I drove around not knowing to what extent each of these systems was switched on or what they did, exactly. Studies of car dealerships have found that many people selling these systems are not much better informed than I was; in 2015, a video that went viral in the online car world showed a salesperson behind the wheel of a Volvo X60 driving into a crowd of customers; he was demonstrating the car\u2019s City Safety system, but he had failed to understand that, unlike other Volvo safety systems, the one he was showing off did not include pedestrian detection. (None of the people hit were seriously injured.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of course, people can learn to understand new tools. More troubling is the fact that very little robust evidence has been available as to pedestrian avoidance systems\u2019 real-world benefits. The organisations rating these systems do so based on tests conducted in laboratories and on test tracks, but it has not yet been reliably established how well these tests predict performance on actual roads, with real live pedestrians instead of crash test dummies (not to mention variable light and rain conditions).</p> <p>\u201cThese technologies are still very much in their infancy,\u201d says Laura Sandt, a pedestrian safety expert at the University of North Carolina Highway Safety Research Center. In the US, pedestrian avoidance systems are rated by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The organisation, Sandt explains \u201cis only able to test effectiveness in very specific conditions. One big example is that, in their tests, the vehicles are always going straight. But we know that a huge number of pedestrians are hit by vehicles that are turning. We have no way of knowing how well the tests line up with real-world conditions.\u201d</p> <p>In the US, almost every article about pedestrian avoidance systems cites a single real-world impact study, holding it up as evidence that such systems could decrease pedestrian collisions by 35%. This study is the best one available, for the simple reason that it is the only one available. This makes its weaknesses all the more glaring: it considers only one system, the Subaru EyeSight, and uses a severely limited methodology that \u2013 as the study\u2019s authors acknowledge but press coverage never does \u2013 meant the authors could not know for sure that they were accurately counting the total number of times Subarus hit pedestrians. No one can honestly claim to know how well these systems do what they claim. A 2018 study concluded that, when it came to simply detecting pedestrians (let alone avoiding them), these systems would have to improve their performance tenfold just to match that of humans.</p> <p>Plus, as several of the experts I spoke to reminded me: every year since 2010, cars with pedestrian avoidance systems have represented a higher proportion than ever of cars moving around on American roads. And almost every year since 2010, the pedestrian death count has gone up.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The origin story of pedestrian avoidance systems has almost nothing to do with a desire to protect pedestrians. Instead, they grew out of a desire to make war more bloodless \u2013 or more bloodless for the US side, anyway. In 2004, the US Department of Defense announced a race, open to all comers. Entrants were asked to build a vehicle that could undertake a journey without immediate human input: no driver in the car, no remote control. Whoever\u2019s vehicle made it through a 150-mile course in the Mojave desert first would win $1m.</p> <p>For years before the race, the military had been trying and failing to create unmanned vehicles to minimise the loss of life along battlefield supply routes. The widespread use of improvised landmines in post-9/11 warzones had only increased the urgency. The DoD races (there was a desert sequel in 2005 and a San Francisco-based contest in 2007) attracted teams of the world\u2019s brightest and most ambitious engineers and programmers, focusing their energy on a new goal to which very few people had given much thought before.</p> <p>It was all this excitement among techies that put the idea of driverless vehicles on Silicon Valley\u2019s radar. In 2009, when Google launched its self-driving car lab, it was staffed almost entirely by participants in the military contests. Like the US military, tech conglomerates had a specific motive for developing these cars. Again, the central concern was not road safety, let alone pedestrian safety. In several industries, from taxis to long-haul transport, one of the major costs is the need to pay human drivers, plus to reckon with those drivers\u2019 human limits, such as the need for sleep and bathroom breaks. By removing the need for humans, and providing the replacement at a lower cost, tech firms stood to reap big profits \u2013 especially if the new vehicles relied on wireless internet connections, served as streaming entertainment stations for their passengers, and generated gigabytes of harvestable data per journey. For some transport companies, such as Uber, self-driving vehicles are a cornerstone of their long-term plans. One reason that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/apr/11/uber-to-share-intimate-details-about-company-ahead-of-going-public\" title=\"\">Uber has never turned a profit</a> is because of the cost of paying human drivers. The company believes that if it can win the race for self-driving technology, it will finally be in the black. Since 2016, it has invested more than $1bn towards achieving this goal; this April, its self-driving team secured another $1bn in investments from Toyota, SoftBank and the Japanese carmaker Denso.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c4d27ddf64f1255579709eeb1e3a3d33a2d6b407\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4d27ddf64f1255579709eeb1e3a3d33a2d6b407/0_909_4774_2865/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A 1950s illustration depicting a utopian world of driverless cars\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A 1950s illustration depicting a utopian world of driverless cars.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: GraphicaArtis/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of course, in time-honoured Silicon Valley tradition, this simple profit motive was quickly swaddled in all manner of high-flying rhetoric about saving lives (of car users and pedestrians alike), saving cities and transforming transportation as we know it. \u201cEvery year that we delay this, more people die,\u201d Anthony Levandowski, then of Google, told the New Yorker in 2013. At a 2016 press event, Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, warned journalists who expressed doubts about self-driving cars \u2013 like the type that Tesla plans to sell \u2013 that they had blood on their hands. \u201cIf, in writing something that\u2019s negative, you effectively dissuade people from using an autonomous vehicle, you\u2019re killing people.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere is simply a very good business reason for car companies to sell people a future where everything is better, especially when the way to get there is by purchasing a lot of cars,\u201d says Peter Norton, perhaps the most prominent historian of how Americans think about traffic safety. As Norton pointed out, car manufacturers have long made a practice of stoking consumer dissatisfaction, and yoking it to utopian visions of the future in which cars of the future solve problems created by cars of the present. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any chance that autonomous vehicles will deliver us a safe future, and I don\u2019t necessarily think the companies think so either. I think they think we\u2019ll buy a lot of stuff. The safe future will recede before our eyes like a desert mirage.\u201d</p> <p>The self-driving car \u201cspace\u201d is flooded in loose cash. This is why pedestrian avoidance systems are becoming ubiquitous. Investment dollars have both improved the required parts and programmes and pushed down their cost. Otherwise, they would not be affordable enough to sell to any but the richest car-buyers. Meanwhile, the race continues. The tech companies keep saying they are almost there (they know they said they were almost there before, but this time is different, they promise). Almost every major car company has partnered with a lab developing self-driving car technology, either because they think it might become a requirement to stay in business, or because enough of their shareholders think so that they need to make a show of playing along.</p> <p>All this activity \u2013 and the rollout of shiny pedestrian avoidance systems \u2013 feeds more credulous media coverage, stoking our cultural sense, unsupported by any evidence, that of course our hardworking nerds are on the brink of unveiling safe self-driving cars. Why not? A car that is basically a smartphone will, of course, have no temptation to look at its smartphone.</p> <p>One night in March 2018, a 49-year-old woman named Elaine Herzberg was pushing a bicycle laden with grocery bags across a four-lane road in Tempe, Arizona when she was struck and killed by a Volvo X90 operating under the control of Uber\u2019s self-driving software. As is standard practice, a backup safety driver, employed by Uber, was sitting in the car, the idea being that she would take over in the case of error. 1.3 seconds before impact, Uber\u2019s software calculated that emergency braking was called for. According to Uber, self-braking had been turned off to reduce jerky and unpredictable behaviour. With less than a second to go, the safety driver tried\u2013\u2013and failed\u2013\u2013to swerve away. (The post-crash investigation indicated that she had probably been watching the singing contest The Voice on her phone.) News outlets around the world covered Herzberg\u2019s death in obsessive detail, asking whether it indicated that autonomous vehicles were less \u201cready\u201d than we had been led to believe.</p> <p>But, just as the original quest for autonomous vehicles had nothing to do with pedestrian safety, concern over Herzberg\u2019s death often felt curiously divorced from concern for pedestrians in general. Herzberg was killed in March 2018. Between January and June of that year, 124 pedestrians were killed in Arizona, more than all but four other states in absolute terms, and more than all but one on a per capita basis. It goes without saying that none of these pedestrians\u2019 names are known around the world, or that any of them generated a slurry of commentary about whether the American transportation environment is \u201csafe enough\u201d or \u201cas safe as it should be\u201d.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The sight, to our contemporary eyes, of a car navigating without a human behind the steering wheel, is so viscerally strange \u2013 so sci-fi \u2013 that it can obscure the extent to which a self-driving car remains \u2026 a car. Engine, seats, wheels. Similarly, our contemporary sense that hi-tech disruption comes for all things can obscure the extent to which the world promised by autonomous cars is still a world full of cars. To the extent that the world\u2019s roads and cities remain shaped around the worship of smooth car traffic flow, the laws of physics will continue to make them dangerous places for everyone, especially those not protected by a steel frame and airbags.</p> <p>The problems of car culture and car-centric planning \u2013 with its hostility to an activity as beneficial and simple as walking around \u2013 are an American gift to the world, but unfortunately they are not exclusively American problems. Worldwide, urbanisation and car ownership are on track to increase massively in coming years. One in three new cars sold globally are SUVs or \u201ccrossovers\u201d: smaller SUVs that get better fuel economy but replicate many of the hazards to pedestrians. To the extent that poorer countries building new roads follow traditionally American models of street planning, pedestrians will continue to be the most vulnerable road users in the world. And to the extent that self-driving car hype influences thinking on the future of road safety, the debate will remain muddled.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s say these cars are going to be the miracle solution,\u201d says Etienne Krug, a Belgian epidemiologist who works on road safety for the World Health Organization. \u201cI think it\u2019s very naive to think so \u2013 but maybe. Even if they were ready tomorrow: it takes a long time for the fleet of vehicles on the road to get totally replaced. Let\u2019s say it takes 10 years. What are we supposed to do in the meantime? Let millions of people die on the road? And then what if the miracle solution never comes? We need to assume it won\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPeople in the international road safety community aren\u2019t running around incredibly excited about autonomous vehicles,\u201d says Ben Welle. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if they\u2019re going to work, or when they\u2019re going to work. And meanwhile we know what we can do: we can get over this idea that we must engineer unending car flow. And we can do that now. And we need to do it no matter what happens with autonomy. An unending flow of autonomous cars is just as bad. And that could happen if we\u2019re not careful.\u201d</p> <p>In the UK and western Europe, the question of whether pedestrian fatality numbers can once again decline may depend on political will, which varies from country to country. In Sweden, for example, stagnating pedestrian death numbers have been a cause for immense concern from the country\u2019s safety officials, who have committed to doing whatever it takes, including developing new street surfaces that are softer for pedestrians to fall on, and even banning cars from the core of major cities.</p> <p>In the UK, by contrast, the coalition government formed in 2010 opted to no longer set goals for road casualty reductions of any kind, because setting goals meant the possibility of admitting failure; no new national targets have been set since, which safety advocates point to as part of the reason for the lack of progress. \u201cWe picked off a lot of the low-hanging fruit,\u201d says Joshua Harris of Brake, a UK road safety charity. \u201cAnd now it\u2019s the difficult decisions that need to be made, decisions about whether we\u2019re going to fundamentally reshape the landscape to be a place where everyone can travel in a safe and healthy way.\u201d</p> <p>In the US, meanwhile, it remains the case that pedestrian advocates have failed to engineer the cultural process that transforms a scattered mass of dead and injured bodies into a widely recognised problem. They have not come close. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/17/boeing-737-max-congressional-hearing-testimony\" title=\"\">When two Boeing 737s </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/17/boeing-737-max-congressional-hearing-testimony\" title=\"\">went down</a>, killing 346 people, it triggered multiple government investigations. Crash reconstruction and analysis experts showed up. Corporate spokespeople apologised, began handing out cheques to victims\u2019 families and swore to do better. Journalists searched for explanations. But cars kill a 737\u2019s worth of American pedestrians every couple of weeks. Internationally, it is more than three 737s per day. And the news cycle barely stutters.</p> <p>In 2017, for the first time, each US state was required to submit road fatality reduction targets to the federal government. Most states set extremely limited goals: Wisconsin, for example, aimed to have 342 pedestrian fatalities, instead of 361. Several set a rather fatalistic goal of no reduction at all. Eighteen states went a step further, setting as their target an increase in their pedestrian death count. It is not that they want more pedestrians to die. But they know that people are likely to be driving more, they know what their roads are like and they know the laws of physics. Unlike the unending stream of hype coming from the autonomous car sector, these dour projections received no coverage outside of traffic reform circles. Unfortunately, they are more likely to contain the truth.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 3 October 2019 to clarify the sequence of events before the fatality in Tempe, Arizona.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In 2010, the small community of specialists who pay attention to US road safety statistics picked up the first signs of a troubling trend: more and more pedestrians were being killed on American roads. That year, 4,302 American pedestrians died, an increase of almost 5% from 2009. The tally has increased almost every year since, with particularly sharp spikes in 2015 and 2016. Last year, 41% more US pedestrians were killed than in 2008. During this same period, overall non-pedestrian road fatalities moved in the opposite direction, decreasing by more than 7%. For drivers, roads are as safe as they have ever been; for people on foot, roads keep getting deadlier. Through the 90s and 00s, the pedestrian death count had declined almost every year. No one would have confused the US for a walkers\u2019 paradise \u2013 at least part of the reason fewer pedestrians died in this period was that people were driving more and walking less, which meant that there were fewer opportunities to be struck. But at least the death toll was shrinking. The fact that, globally, pedestrian fatalities were much more common in poorer countries made it possible to view pedestrian death as part of an unfortunate, but temporary, stage of development: growing pains on the road to modernity, destined to decrease eventually as a matter of course. The US road death statistics of the last decade have blasted a hole in that theory. (A similar trend has been observed with regards to the country\u2019s cyclists: a recent analysis found that cyclist fatalities decreased through the 80s, 90s and 00s, but since 2010 have increased 25%, with 777 cyclists killed in 2017.) Trouble, albeit of a less dramatic sort, has also been brewing in the UK and western European countries, long seen as bastions of pedestrian-friendly (and cyclist-friendly) conditions. Through the 70s and 80s, these countries\u2019 fatality rates were just as bad as America\u2019s, or worse. But, since then, their progress has been more substantial and more enduring. The problem is that, since 2010, that progress has mostly sputtered to a halt. In general, the fatality numbers are not going down. \u201cThere\u2019s immense frustration,\u201d says Philip Gomm, of the RAC Foundation, a UK organisation that studies road safety issues. \u201cThings were getting better, and now they\u2019re not.\u201d In almost every country in the world, regardless of national prosperity, it remains on average more dangerous, per mile of travel, to be a pedestrian than to be a car driver or passenger. Worldwide, more than 700 pedestrians die every day, disproportionately in poorer countries. At least four times that number are seriously injured. We talk a great deal about how cars congest our cities and pollute the atmosphere. We talk less about how they keep killing and maiming people simply trying to get from A to B on two feet. Lately, our cultural conversation about road safety has been dominated by visions, sold by Silicon Valley, of vehicles that minimise or even eliminate the need for input from a fallible human driver. Every year, more cars come armed with \u201cpedestrian detection and avoidance\u201d systems; soon, these systems will likely be standard issue. And not long after that, we are promised, sensors and self-improving algorithms will take over the driving process altogether, eliminating human error from roads and ushering in a new golden age of safety for all their users, whether or not they\u2019re cocooned by a car\u2019s steel frame. Since 2017, General Motors, the US\u2019s largest car manufacturer, has claimed that it is developing self-driving vehicles in the service of a \u201ctriple-zero\u201d world: zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion. The possibility of making pedestrians safer is a welcome one, not least because walking is so undeniably good. Walking boosts physical and mental health, draws communities together and produces no carbon emissions. But there are good reasons to be sceptical about the promises made by the proselytisers of the high-tech car future. Car companies swear they are here to help \u2013 by selling us products that hardly ever hit anyone or anything. But the truth is that this promise is, at best, a distraction. In fact, much of our discourse around cars, self-driving or otherwise, is less about transforming the status quo than maintaining it, obscuring paths to progress exactly when we need them most, and leaving pedestrians right in the line of fire. * * * Ask a room full of road safety experts what is causing pedestrian fatalities to increase and most will admit that, well, they are not exactly sure. Every time a car hits a pedestrian, it represents the intersection of a vast number of variables. At the level of those involved, there is the question of who is distracted, reckless, drunk. Zooming out, there are factors such as the design and condition of the road, the quality (or absence) of a marked pedestrian crossing, the speed limit, the local lighting, the weight and height of the car involved. In a crash, all these variables and more converge at high speed in real-world, non-laboratory conditions that make it hard to isolate the influence of each variable. Attempting to explain a trend \u2013 to correctly apportion blame not for one but thousands of pedestrian deaths \u2013 adds yet more layers of complexity. Economic and employment trends, the availability and quality of public transport, shifts in the age of walkers and drivers: it all matters. Disentangling the threads in a scientifically rigorous way is fiendishly difficult. \u201cThere are multiple theories about how to account for what is happening,\u201d says Norman Garrick, a University of Connecticut professor who studies road safety. \u201cWe know something radically new is going on. But I don\u2019t think we have an exact answer yet.\u201d Ask that same room of road safety experts a slightly different question \u2013 not exactly why US pedestrians fatalities have risen lately, but instead why the US has more of them than any other wealthy country \u2013 and the answers will come flooding out. In recent months, after conversations with more than a dozen such experts, I became familiar with a particular tone of voice: deep frustration at how obvious it all is, but wrapped in a package of professional cheeriness. \u201cWell, where to start?\u201d says Eric Dumbaugh of Florida Atlantic University. \u201cSo much of it is relatively simple, which makes the lack of progress that much more aggravating.\u201d Here is what the frustrated safety experts will tell you: Americans are driving more than ever, more than residents of any other country. More of them than ever are living in cities and out in urban sprawl; a growing number of pedestrian fatalities occur on the fringes of cities, where high-volume, high-speed roads exist in close proximity to the places where people live, work, and shop. Speed limits have increased across the country over the past 20 years, despite robust evidence that even slight increases in speed dramatically increase the likelihood of killing pedestrians (car passengers, too \u2013 but the increase is not as steep, thanks to improvements in the design of car frames, airbags and seatbelts). American road engineers tend to assume people will speed, and so design roads to accommodate speeding; this, in turn, facilitates more speeding, which soon enough makes higher speed limits feel reasonable. And more Americans than ever are zipping around in SUVs and pickup trucks, which, thanks to their height, weight and shape are between two and three times more likely to kill people they hit. SUVs are also the most profitable cars on the market, for the simple reason buyers are willing to pay more for them. As with speeding, there appears to be a self-perpetuating cycle at work: the increased presence of large cars on the road makes them feel more dangerous, which makes owning a large car yourself feel more comforting. More fundamentally, the US is the country in the world most shaped, physically and culturally, by the presumption that the uninterrupted flow of car traffic is an obvious public good, one that deserves to trump all others in the road planning process. Many of its younger cities are designed almost entirely around planning paradigms in which pedestrians were either ignored or factored only as nuisances. Cars move fast and are heavy and hard; humans on foot move slower and are made of flesh and bone. \u201cThe layperson can realise, if they think about it for a minute, that if you want to keep people safe, you have to design streets differently,\u201d says Dumbaugh. \u201cYou have to slow the cars down. You have to recognise the reality of road users who aren\u2019t in cars. You have to design roads so people in cars take notice of their fellow road users. But these basic realisations aren\u2019t things the US transportation system knows or integrates into practice. And so people keep getting killed.\u201d While safety experts tend to focus on broad factors \u2013 the road environment and what types of behaviour it encourages \u2013 America\u2019s cultural discourse on road safety tends to go in the opposite direction, zooming in on that most American of variables: the individual. It is not cars, car culture or bad, car-centric planning that kill pedestrians. Instead, it is individuals making bad choices about how to use the roads. There is no greater symptom of this worldview than the recurring focus on mobile phones, especially smartphones and their tendency to monopolise our limited attention. Road signs warning against phone use while driving are so commonplace that they almost blend into the landscape. Parents make their kids promise they won\u2019t use their phones while driving. Kids nod and promise they won\u2019t. Phone-tracking studies indicate that most of them do it anyway and that their parents do, too. In recent years, America\u2019s fear of the distracted driver expanded to include the distracted walker. This is a replay of an old phenomenon: it was the US that invented the concept of the \u201cjaywalker\u201d, a \u201cjay\u201d being an unsophisticated person from the country who did not even know how to walk correctly. In the US, much like anywhere that cars have taken hold, drivers screaming at pedestrians (and cyclists) that they are doing it wrong is a fixture of national life. More recently, numerous states and cities, including San Francisco and New York, have launched public campaigns against inattentive walking, as has the US National Safety Council. Some jurisdictions have passed, or sought to pass, bills that would make using a smartphone while crossing the road an offence punishable by fine. On Twitter, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has weighed in on the pedestrian safety crisis primarily by coaching pedestrians on how to protect themselves. \u201cWhen you are walking, be predictable\u201d, advises @NHTSAgov. Ask a room full of safety experts about smartphones and you will get a mix of resignation, bemusement and contempt. \u201cI tend not to buy the smartphone distraction stuff,\u201d says Garrick, echoing nearly identical comments from just about everyone I talked to. \u201cTo me, it reads as shoving aside actually dealing with the relevant issues.\u201d What particularly bothers him, he says, is how poorly thought out the distraction discourse tends to be. In the UK, Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Austria and Iceland, for example, pedestrian deaths occur at a per capita rate roughly half of America\u2019s, or lower. Are we really to believe that the citizens of these countries are 50% less susceptible than Americans to distraction, by their phones or anything else? Plus, within the US, pedestrian death occurs disproportionately in neighbourhoods populated by people with low-incomes and people of colour. Is distraction really more endemic in those neighbourhoods, or among people driving through them, than it is in wealthier, whiter areas? Or is it more likely that these neighbourhoods are more likely to be criss-crossed by high-speed roads, and less likely to receive investment in transit interventions that protect pedestrians? \u201cAll this talk about pedestrian distraction, driver distraction? It\u2019s such a distraction,\u201d says Ben Welle of the World Resource Institute for Sustainable Cities. \u201cIt puts all the responsibility on individuals, and none on the environment they operate in.\u201d * * * Over the past decade, as the American pedestrian\u2019s plight has worsened, global car manufacturers have stepped forward with news of a supposedly game-changing innovation, one that might at last improve the fate of those who want to travel on foot. This innovation has nothing to do with re-engineering roads, regulating SUV design, investing in public transit or any other intervention that would require using the creaky levers of democratic politics. Instead, people just have to buy new cars. In spring 2010, Volvo announced what sounded like the inauguration of a new era, one in which cars at last acknowledged pedestrians. Starting that autumn, anyone who bought a Volvo S60 saloon could, for an extra $2,100 (\u00a31,700), have it equipped with Pedestrian Detection, a radar-and-camera-based system designed to sense the presence of pedestrians in the car\u2019s path \u2013 and, if needed, automatically brake to avoid hitting them. An older variety of sensor, made available in 2005, had equipped some cars to sense pedestrian collisions while they were in progress and, in response, pop up their hoods a few inches, creating a \u201ccrumple zone\u201d between the bonnet and the hard machinery inside, making for a softer landing. But these systems had been sold only in Europe, and they did nothing to stop cars from hitting pedestrians in the first place, or slow them down in advance of the collision. Every year since Volvo Pedestrian Detection arrived on the market, systems like it \u2013 like all \u201cassistive driving\u201d features \u2013 have become more sophisticated and more common. As of last year, pedestrian-sensing technology is now standard on close to a third of new vehicles sold in the US, and available as an add-on for another third. In the EU, regulations passed earlier this year will make such systems mandatory on new cars starting in 2022. Their growing popularity is largely attributable to the relevant tech getting cheaper, but endorsements from trusted institutions have also played an important role. Since 2016, Europe\u2019s New Car Assessment Program, which issues influential annual rankings of vehicle safety, has awarded extra points to cars with pedestrian detection and avoidance systems. In the US, the well-respected Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has advocated the widespread adoption of pedestrian avoidance tools. Just this year, the nationally venerated American buyer\u2019s guide Consumer Reports announced that, for the first time, it would factor pedestrian avoidance into its ratings, in hopes of incentivising carmakers to help address rising pedestrian fatalities. At first glance, this all sounds like a long-overdue corrective to the car-first chauvinism that has made American roads so deadly. But none of the safety experts I spoke to were terribly excited about pedestrian avoidance technology. It wasn\u2019t that they doubted it might save some pedestrian lives. Instead, their recurring concern was that it reflects an ongoing focus on individual shortcomings \u2013 on flawed drivers and walkers \u2013 and a neglect of flaws built in to the roads they are forced to use. \u201cPedestrian detection will probably help a bit,\u201d says Dan Albert, author of Are We There Yet?, a history of American car culture. \u201cBut at the same time, it\u2019s pretty clear that these problems can be addressed without hi-tech solutions. And so what are the car companies up to? It\u2019s not just about some altruistic desire for safety, or they would be including these systems on all of their cars, which very few companies are doing. It\u2019s more about creating a range of products that allows them to maximise profit.\u201d Recent studies have found that high percentages of drivers do not understand exactly what these new systems do. I recently rented a car armed with sensors to help you stay in your lane, sensors to detect other cars and sensors to detect pedestrians; for four days I drove around not knowing to what extent each of these systems was switched on or what they did, exactly. Studies of car dealerships have found that many people selling these systems are not much better informed than I was; in 2015, a video that went viral in the online car world showed a salesperson behind the wheel of a Volvo X60 driving into a crowd of customers; he was demonstrating the car\u2019s City Safety system, but he had failed to understand that, unlike other Volvo safety systems, the one he was showing off did not include pedestrian detection. (None of the people hit were seriously injured.) Of course, people can learn to understand new tools. More troubling is the fact that very little robust evidence has been available as to pedestrian avoidance systems\u2019 real-world benefits. The organisations rating these systems do so based on tests conducted in laboratories and on test tracks, but it has not yet been reliably established how well these tests predict performance on actual roads, with real live pedestrians instead of crash test dummies (not to mention variable light and rain conditions). \u201cThese technologies are still very much in their infancy,\u201d says Laura Sandt, a pedestrian safety expert at the University of North Carolina Highway Safety Research Center. In the US, pedestrian avoidance systems are rated by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The organisation, Sandt explains \u201cis only able to test effectiveness in very specific conditions. One big example is that, in their tests, the vehicles are always going straight. But we know that a huge number of pedestrians are hit by vehicles that are turning. We have no way of knowing how well the tests line up with real-world conditions.\u201d In the US, almost every article about pedestrian avoidance systems cites a single real-world impact study, holding it up as evidence that such systems could decrease pedestrian collisions by 35%. This study is the best one available, for the simple reason that it is the only one available. This makes its weaknesses all the more glaring: it considers only one system, the Subaru EyeSight, and uses a severely limited methodology that \u2013 as the study\u2019s authors acknowledge but press coverage never does \u2013 meant the authors could not know for sure that they were accurately counting the total number of times Subarus hit pedestrians. No one can honestly claim to know how well these systems do what they claim. A 2018 study concluded that, when it came to simply detecting pedestrians (let alone avoiding them), these systems would have to improve their performance tenfold just to match that of humans. Plus, as several of the experts I spoke to reminded me: every year since 2010, cars with pedestrian avoidance systems have represented a higher proportion than ever of cars moving around on American roads. And almost every year since 2010, the pedestrian death count has gone up. * * * The origin story of pedestrian avoidance systems has almost nothing to do with a desire to protect pedestrians. Instead, they grew out of a desire to make war more bloodless \u2013 or more bloodless for the US side, anyway. In 2004, the US Department of Defense announced a race, open to all comers. Entrants were asked to build a vehicle that could undertake a journey without immediate human input: no driver in the car, no remote control. Whoever\u2019s vehicle made it through a 150-mile course in the Mojave desert first would win $1m. For years before the race, the military had been trying and failing to create unmanned vehicles to minimise the loss of life along battlefield supply routes. The widespread use of improvised landmines in post-9/11 warzones had only increased the urgency. The DoD races (there was a desert sequel in 2005 and a San Francisco-based contest in 2007) attracted teams of the world\u2019s brightest and most ambitious engineers and programmers, focusing their energy on a new goal to which very few people had given much thought before. It was all this excitement among techies that put the idea of driverless vehicles on Silicon Valley\u2019s radar. In 2009, when Google launched its self-driving car lab, it was staffed almost entirely by participants in the military contests. Like the US military, tech conglomerates had a specific motive for developing these cars. Again, the central concern was not road safety, let alone pedestrian safety. In several industries, from taxis to long-haul transport, one of the major costs is the need to pay human drivers, plus to reckon with those drivers\u2019 human limits, such as the need for sleep and bathroom breaks. By removing the need for humans, and providing the replacement at a lower cost, tech firms stood to reap big profits \u2013 especially if the new vehicles relied on wireless internet connections, served as streaming entertainment stations for their passengers, and generated gigabytes of harvestable data per journey. For some transport companies, such as Uber, self-driving vehicles are a cornerstone of their long-term plans. One reason that Uber has never turned a profit is because of the cost of paying human drivers. The company believes that if it can win the race for self-driving technology, it will finally be in the black. Since 2016, it has invested more than $1bn towards achieving this goal; this April, its self-driving team secured another $1bn in investments from Toyota, SoftBank and the Japanese carmaker Denso. Of course, in time-honoured Silicon Valley tradition, this simple profit motive was quickly swaddled in all manner of high-flying rhetoric about saving lives (of car users and pedestrians alike), saving cities and transforming transportation as we know it. \u201cEvery year that we delay this, more people die,\u201d Anthony Levandowski, then of Google, told the New Yorker in 2013. At a 2016 press event, Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, warned journalists who expressed doubts about self-driving cars \u2013 like the type that Tesla plans to sell \u2013 that they had blood on their hands. \u201cIf, in writing something that\u2019s negative, you effectively dissuade people from using an autonomous vehicle, you\u2019re killing people.\u201d \u201cThere is simply a very good business reason for car companies to sell people a future where everything is better, especially when the way to get there is by purchasing a lot of cars,\u201d says Peter Norton, perhaps the most prominent historian of how Americans think about traffic safety. As Norton pointed out, car manufacturers have long made a practice of stoking consumer dissatisfaction, and yoking it to utopian visions of the future in which cars of the future solve problems created by cars of the present. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any chance that autonomous vehicles will deliver us a safe future, and I don\u2019t necessarily think the companies think so either. I think they think we\u2019ll buy a lot of stuff. The safe future will recede before our eyes like a desert mirage.\u201d The self-driving car \u201cspace\u201d is flooded in loose cash. This is why pedestrian avoidance systems are becoming ubiquitous. Investment dollars have both improved the required parts and programmes and pushed down their cost. Otherwise, they would not be affordable enough to sell to any but the richest car-buyers. Meanwhile, the race continues. The tech companies keep saying they are almost there (they know they said they were almost there before, but this time is different, they promise). Almost every major car company has partnered with a lab developing self-driving car technology, either because they think it might become a requirement to stay in business, or because enough of their shareholders think so that they need to make a show of playing along. All this activity \u2013 and the rollout of shiny pedestrian avoidance systems \u2013 feeds more credulous media coverage, stoking our cultural sense, unsupported by any evidence, that of course our hardworking nerds are on the brink of unveiling safe self-driving cars. Why not? A car that is basically a smartphone will, of course, have no temptation to look at its smartphone. One night in March 2018, a 49-year-old woman named Elaine Herzberg was pushing a bicycle laden with grocery bags across a four-lane road in Tempe, Arizona when she was struck and killed by a Volvo X90 operating under the control of Uber\u2019s self-driving software. As is standard practice, a backup safety driver, employed by Uber, was sitting in the car, the idea being that she would take over in the case of error. 1.3 seconds before impact, Uber\u2019s software calculated that emergency braking was called for. According to Uber, self-braking had been turned off to reduce jerky and unpredictable behaviour. With less than a second to go, the safety driver tried\u2013\u2013and failed\u2013\u2013to swerve away. (The post-crash investigation indicated that she had probably been watching the singing contest The Voice on her phone.) News outlets around the world covered Herzberg\u2019s death in obsessive detail, asking whether it indicated that autonomous vehicles were less \u201cready\u201d than we had been led to believe. But, just as the original quest for autonomous vehicles had nothing to do with pedestrian safety, concern over Herzberg\u2019s death often felt curiously divorced from concern for pedestrians in general. Herzberg was killed in March 2018. Between January and June of that year, 124 pedestrians were killed in Arizona, more than all but four other states in absolute terms, and more than all but one on a per capita basis. It goes without saying that none of these pedestrians\u2019 names are known around the world, or that any of them generated a slurry of commentary about whether the American transportation environment is \u201csafe enough\u201d or \u201cas safe as it should be\u201d. * * * The sight, to our contemporary eyes, of a car navigating without a human behind the steering wheel, is so viscerally strange \u2013 so sci-fi \u2013 that it can obscure the extent to which a self-driving car remains \u2026 a car. Engine, seats, wheels. Similarly, our contemporary sense that hi-tech disruption comes for all things can obscure the extent to which the world promised by autonomous cars is still a world full of cars. To the extent that the world\u2019s roads and cities remain shaped around the worship of smooth car traffic flow, the laws of physics will continue to make them dangerous places for everyone, especially those not protected by a steel frame and airbags. The problems of car culture and car-centric planning \u2013 with its hostility to an activity as beneficial and simple as walking around \u2013 are an American gift to the world, but unfortunately they are not exclusively American problems. Worldwide, urbanisation and car ownership are on track to increase massively in coming years. One in three new cars sold globally are SUVs or \u201ccrossovers\u201d: smaller SUVs that get better fuel economy but replicate many of the hazards to pedestrians. To the extent that poorer countries building new roads follow traditionally American models of street planning, pedestrians will continue to be the most vulnerable road users in the world. And to the extent that self-driving car hype influences thinking on the future of road safety, the debate will remain muddled. \u201cLet\u2019s say these cars are going to be the miracle solution,\u201d says Etienne Krug, a Belgian epidemiologist who works on road safety for the World Health Organization. \u201cI think it\u2019s very naive to think so \u2013 but maybe. Even if they were ready tomorrow: it takes a long time for the fleet of vehicles on the road to get totally replaced. Let\u2019s say it takes 10 years. What are we supposed to do in the meantime? Let millions of people die on the road? And then what if the miracle solution never comes? We need to assume it won\u2019t.\u201d \u201cPeople in the international road safety community aren\u2019t running around incredibly excited about autonomous vehicles,\u201d says Ben Welle. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if they\u2019re going to work, or when they\u2019re going to work. And meanwhile we know what we can do: we can get over this idea that we must engineer unending car flow. And we can do that now. And we need to do it no matter what happens with autonomy. An unending flow of autonomous cars is just as bad. And that could happen if we\u2019re not careful.\u201d In the UK and western Europe, the question of whether pedestrian fatality numbers can once again decline may depend on political will, which varies from country to country. In Sweden, for example, stagnating pedestrian death numbers have been a cause for immense concern from the country\u2019s safety officials, who have committed to doing whatever it takes, including developing new street surfaces that are softer for pedestrians to fall on, and even banning cars from the core of major cities. In the UK, by contrast, the coalition government formed in 2010 opted to no longer set goals for road casualty reductions of any kind, because setting goals meant the possibility of admitting failure; no new national targets have been set since, which safety advocates point to as part of the reason for the lack of progress. \u201cWe picked off a lot of the low-hanging fruit,\u201d says Joshua Harris of Brake, a UK road safety charity. \u201cAnd now it\u2019s the difficult decisions that need to be made, decisions about whether we\u2019re going to fundamentally reshape the landscape to be a place where everyone can travel in a safe and healthy way.\u201d In the US, meanwhile, it remains the case that pedestrian advocates have failed to engineer the cultural process that transforms a scattered mass of dead and injured bodies into a widely recognised problem. They have not come close. When two Boeing 737s went down, killing 346 people, it triggered multiple government investigations. Crash reconstruction and analysis experts showed up. Corporate spokespeople apologised, began handing out cheques to victims\u2019 families and swore to do better. Journalists searched for explanations. But cars kill a 737\u2019s worth of American pedestrians every couple of weeks. Internationally, it is more than three 737s per day. And the news cycle barely stutters. In 2017, for the first time, each US state was required to submit road fatality reduction targets to the federal government. Most states set extremely limited goals: Wisconsin, for example, aimed to have 342 pedestrian fatalities, instead of 361. Several set a rather fatalistic goal of no reduction at all. Eighteen states went a step further, setting as their target an increase in their pedestrian death count. It is not that they want more pedestrians to die. But they know that people are likely to be driving more, they know what their roads are like and they know the laws of physics. Unlike the unending stream of hype coming from the autonomous car sector, these dour projections received no coverage outside of traffic reform circles. Unfortunately, they are more likely to contain the truth. \u2022 This article was amended on 3 October 2019 to clarify the sequence of events before the fatality in Tempe, Arizona. \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

He didn\u2019t realise he was ill until his wife bought him a health check for his 50th birthday, which unearthed a tumour requiring an operation \u201cwhere they cut open my ribs and cut loads of nerves and stuff\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Rollo Armstrong is clearly not a man used to giving interviews. He\u2019s not suspicious or wary \u2013 quite the opposite, he\u2019s very friendly \u2013 but he has a pad with him that I get the feeling contains notes for him to refer to during his answers. When I get my phone out to record our conversation, he produces his own. Not, he says sheepishly, because he doesn\u2019t trust the press, but because he wants to listen back afterwards and see how he\u2019s done. Until now, he shrugs, \u201cthere\u2019s never been a need for me to say anything about anything, really\u201d. It\u2019s hard not to applaud Armstrong\u2019s skill at avoiding the limelight so completely that his Wikipedia page comes accompanied by a photo that looks like it was taken while he was still at university. He is, after all, a member of a band who, at the last count, had sold something like 15m records worldwide: Faithless, whose supercharged, stadium-packing take on late 90s club music, most notably trance and what used to be called epic house, has a claim to presage the rise of EDM, of which more later. If you factor in the albums he helped his sister, Dido, make \u2013 the first two of which are among the biggest-selling in UK chart history \u2013 the total goes up to something like 50m. But the closest he ever got to appearing on stage with Faithless was manning the mixing desk at their first gig. \u201cWell, I can\u2019t play an instrument,\u201d he says with a frown, which never stopped other dance producers from prodding at an unplugged synth while a backing track plays \u2013 and basking in the adulation of their fans. Nor did he ever feel like doing the obvious thing and using the success of the huge hits he co-wrote with his sister \u2013 Here With Me, White Flag, Life For Rent \u2013 as an opportunity to start a career as the kind of blue-chip songwriter for hire that currently dominates pop. \u201cThat\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve never done and will never do,\u201d he shudders, as if I\u2019d just suggested he use the success of Dido\u2019s hit singles as an opportunity to plunge his head in a bucket of sick. Indeed, he notes, he wouldn\u2019t be here today had he not made a solo album, albeit one that features his sister and most of Faithless \u2013 The Last Summer, under the name R Plus. And he wouldn\u2019t have made a solo album had he not contracted lung cancer a couple of years ago. He didn\u2019t realise he was ill until his wife bought him a health check for his 50th birthday, which unearthed a tumour requiring an operation \u201cwhere they cut open my ribs and cut loads of nerves and stuff\u201d. After the operation, he suffered from thoracotomy syndrome \u201cwhere it feels like your nerves are on fire inside of you, they won\u2019t meld together. It\u2019s just horrible.\u201d He\u2019s now \u201cfully cured so no sympathy needed\u201d, but spent his recuperation \u201cgoing back to stuff I loved \u2013 books, films, albums, and when you hear excellence or read excellence, it makes you want to raise your own bar\u201d. Prior to his illness, he\u2019d been living in a kind of semi-retirement, Faithless having last made an album nine years ago. \u201cBut in a very cliched banal way,\u201d he says, \u201ccancer does make you slightly re-evaluate your life. I thought once I get back \u2013 if I get back \u2013 I want a little purple patch, a bit like\u2026\u201d He searches for a comparison and laughs. \u201cPhilip Roth.\u201d The result, The Last Summer, is an unashamedly sepia-tinted and sunlit album inspired by holidays he spent in his teens and early 20s in Greece and Ibiza. It sounds not unlike the strain of electronica that got bracketed as chill-out at the turn of the millennium \u2013 Air, R\u00f6yksopp, Moby\u2019s Play \u2013 which means it fits perfectly with a curious current trend for dance music nostalgia. You can\u2019t move at the moment for orchestras sawing their way through 90s dance hits, Faithless\u2019s Insomnia invariably among them, for the edification of middle-aged former ravers. It\u2019s not the first time that Armstrong has seemed like a canny operator with an intuitive understanding of what a certain audience wants.

He concedes that he \u201chas the kind of taste that a lot of people seem to have\u201d but everything else, all 50m albums of it, has been a matter of good fortune and providence. He was brought up in a bohemian, literary north London household where TV was banned \u2013 a rule Dido tells me was so ferociously policed that when the siblings tried to smuggle a portable TV into their bedroom, their mother threw it out of the window. This clearly left its mark: his children are called Dalloway and Larkin and he mentions an abiding love of Jane Austen. Armstrong fell into producing after meeting Rob Dougan \u2013 later the author of the inescapable Elgar-sampling chill-out track Clubbed to Death \u2013 at a party while travelling in Australia. The pair cornered an English producer at another party, who agreed to get them studio time provided they worked with his girlfriend, a model with ambitions to sing. \u201cGood for him, he quickly realised she couldn\u2019t sing at all, but he got us signed to a label over there with another singer.

      "bodyText": "Is this democracy\u2019s death spiral? Are we, in this country and others, falling into a lethal cycle of fury and reaction, that blocks the reasoned conversation on which civic life depends? In every age there have been political hucksters using aggression, lies and outrage to drown out reasoned argument. But not since the 1930s have so many succeeded. Donald Trump, Boris Johnson, Narendra Modi, Jair Bolsonaro, Scott Morrison, Rodrigo Duterte, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, Viktor Orb\u00e1n and many others have discovered that the digital age offers rich pickings. The anger and misunderstanding that social media generates, exacerbated by troll factories, bots and covertly funded political advertising, spill into real life. Today, politicians and commentators speak a language of violence that was unthinkable a few years ago. In the UK, Johnson mocks the memory of the murdered MP Jo Cox. Nigel Farage, talking of civil servants, promises that \u201conce Brexit\u2019s done, we will take the knife to them\u201d. Brendan O\u2019Neill, editor of the website Spiked, a publication that has received funding from the Koch brothers, told the BBC that there should be riots over Brexit\u2019s delay.

Just three years ago, Zorn had steady work as a cook and a place to live. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t view us as homeless people,\u201d Zorn said of the neighbors who installed the boulders. \u201cThey should view us as human beings who just have life problems. They could be one paycheck short of being homeless too. It could happen to them, it could happen to anybody.\u201d Hannah Hayne sat outside the Safeway across from Whole Foods with a palm-sized cardboard sign reading \u201cNeed Food.\u201d The 27-year-old said she could go back to school and get off the streets with some help, but spoke with a circular cadence that suggested there was more to her situation than she cared to share. She had a head injury that was exacerbated when she was hit by a rock while homeless, she said, which she has been on and off since the age of 16. \u201cI\u2019ve been outside too long,\u201d Hayne said. Hayne started to say she understood why people didn\u2019t want homeless people around, and that anti-homeless architecture like the boulders would give the homeless the boost they need to \u201cget inside\u201d before her thoughts ran from her again. \u201cIt\u2019s just confusing to me because I feel like there should be an inside to get into,\u201d Hayne said. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand how there\u2019s not.\u201d",

The letter states that the city\u2019s incomplete data shows \u201cit discharging approximately one and a half billion gallons of combined sewage annually onto beaches and other sensitive areas, including areas where recreation takes place\u201d. \u201cThe failure to properly operate and maintain the city\u2019s sewage collection and treatment facilities\u201d caused force main and pump station failures \u201cthat have diverted substantial volumes of raw and partially-treated sewage to flow across beaches and into the San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean\u201d, the letter states. The notice of violation comes after the EPA sent a letter to the California governor, Gavin Newsom, accusing the state of failing to stop water pollution from human waste left by the homeless in cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco. The week before that, the Trump administration moved to revoke California\u2019s authority to set automobile emission standards tougher than the federal government\u2019s. In a letter to Wheeler regarding his letter to Newsom, San Francisco public utilities commission general manager Harlan Kelly said the EPA\u2019s allegation of \u201cone billion gallons of combined sewage\u201d dumped into the bay and ocean is mischaracterized. \u201cAll combined sewer overflows are subject to equivalent-to-primary treatment before discharge,\u201d Kelly wrote. \u201cThe frequency and volume of combined sewer overflows is consistent with the expected performance of the city\u2019s combined sewer system and has been specifically authorized \u2014 for decades \u2014 by permits either issued jointly by EPA and California or by permits that have received EPA\u2019s concurrence.\u201d San Francisco officials have repeatedly said that needles and human waste are not flowing into the ocean en masse. According to the city\u2019s Public Utilities Commission, catch basins trap any debris coming out of storm drains, while two city treatment facilities process any runoff or pollutants that hadn\u2019t been filtered out. The city attorney Dennis Herrera responded to Wednesday\u2019s notice by submitting a Freedom of Information Act request to the EPA \u201cfor records related to these unwarranted attacks on San Francisco\u201d. \u201cThese attacks on San Francisco are a politically motivated ploy,\u201d Herrera said in a statement. \u201cThe Trump administration is ignoring facts and misusing the EPA to attack people it disagrees with.\u201d The city\u2019s mayor, London Breed says the violation notice contains \u201cmischaracterizations, inaccuracies and falsehoods\u201d and says the city\u2019s sewer system is one of the most effective in the country. The move is the latest escalation in an ongoing feud between the progressive state and the Trump administration. The state attorney general, Xavier Becerra, has filed more than 60 lawsuits against the White House over issues ranging from immigration to the environment. Agencies contributed reporting.",

      "bodyText": "Centrelink issued a $14,500 robodebt to a disability pensioner with an intellectual impairment and then failed to offer him support to deal with the alleged overpayment, a Senate inquiry has heard. Katherine Boyle, the executive director of the Welfare Rights Centre, told a hearing into the controversial debt recovery scheme on Thursday that her organisation was helping the man to challenge the debt after being contacted by his mother. Boyle said the man, known as Paul to protect his identity, lived independently from his mother in supported accomodation and earned a \u201cmodest income\u201d from pushing trolleys at a supermarket. Paul\u2019s mother was not his Centrelink nominee, so she was not notified when the debt was raised. Last year, Paul received a $14,500 overpayment related to his disability support pension, Boyle said. He received no support from Centrelink to deal with the alleged overpayment and was only assisted by the Welfare Rights Centre when his mother learned of the debt. \u201c[The scheme] is exploitative of people with disabilities because they have no opportunity to really understand what\u2019s going on,\u201d Boyle said. \u201cPaul was lucky his mum intervened and we could provide further assistance. If he didn\u2019t have his mother or us he would be paying back that debt without it ever being properly established. \u201cThere is no way Paul has deliberately underreported his income in any way.\u201d Boyle said the agency was aware of Paul\u2019s intellectual disability because it was the reason he was granted the pension. His case was raised on the first day of hearings for the Senate inquiry, the third to examine the program since 2017. Since the debt recovery scheme was expanded in 2015, only 4% of debts raised have targeted disability pensioners, with the overwhelming majority aimed at recouping alleged Newstart and Youth Allowance debts. But Acoss said that while the Department of Human Services had records of which welfare recipients were considered vulnerable, once a person moved off income support payments the agency no longer held up-to-date information about their circumstances. That meant vulnerable people have been caught up in the scheme, despite the department saying that it had mostly shielded them from the online debt recovery process. \u2018Reverse onus of proof\u2019 The Department of Human Services was lashed by the committee after it conceded it had only helped people caught up in the robodebt scheme get payslips from 1,000 employers since 2017. That was despite widespread complaints that welfare recipients are unable to obtain this evidence, which can date back seven years and that they need to disprove an alleged overpayment. It has issued more than 900,000 debt letters in the life of the scheme. The Labor senator Deb O\u2019Neill said the government\u2019s debt recovery scheme operated on a \u201creverse onus of proof\u201d, a claim that was denied by the department. Officials said they helped people get information from employers or banks where a welfare recipient could not, but O\u2019Neill said it was inconceivable there weren\u2019t many thousands more who needed assistance. Annette Musolino, an acting deputy secretary at the Department of Human Services, replied: \u201cWell, there\u2019s no evidence of that. We help the people who contact us.\u201d Leaked internal documents, seen by Guardian Australia, show the department has this year considered using its coercive powers more often. The department advised the government against this as it looked at ways to ensure the program meets its budget targets because it would increase the time involved to complete a review and result in a reduction in the scheme\u2019s fiscal savings. Earlier, Acoss also raised concerns that the department was using the controversial process of income averaging more often than previously thought. Under income averaging, Centrelink staff will spread person\u2019s annual income reported to Centrelink over 26 fortnights and compare this to their income reported to Centrelink while they received welfare payments. Critics argue the process routinely results in false debts, but the department says it is only used when a person fails to provide evidence of their past income. \u201cThe onus should be on Centrelink to prove that a debt exists,\u201d said Charmaine Crowe, a senior adviser at Acoss. \u201cLikewise the use of averaging ... should be stopped immediately.\u201d Jason McNamara, a general manager at the Department of Human Services, said the department issued letters questioning people about their income where its data-matching algorithm detected a $1,000 difference between tax office data and income reported to Centrelink. McNamara said the department\u2019s \u201cdebt predictor\u201d said there would be a debt raised in 95% of cases where such a discrepancy was detected. However, O\u2019Neill said that the \u201cpredictor\u201d did not take into account if a person had \u201clumpy employment\u201d over 12 months, meaning that in those cases \u201cfrom the very beginning [the calculation was] wrong\u201d. The Liberal senator Matt O\u2019Sullivan pushed back against criticisms of the scheme, saying welfare recipients could seek assistance from Centrelink staff once they received notice of a discrepancy between income they had reported to the agency and tax office data. Noting evidence from the department of human services, he stressed that staff were involved in issuing debts and conducting reviews. \u201cThe term robodebt seems to be quite a misnomer,\u201d he said. As with wage earners dealing with the tax office, O\u2019Sullivan said it was the responsibility of welfare recipients to ensure the information they provided to Centrelink was correct. The scheme is currently the subject of a legal challenge by Victoria Legal Aid and a potential class action backed by the Labor opposition. The inquiry chair, Greens senator Rachel Siewert, flagged that the Senate committee would ask the department to front another hearing in coming weeks. Acoss and the National Social Security Rights Network said the robodebt scheme should be abolished.",

      "bodyText": "The social services minister, Anne Ruston, has been accused of being \u201cout of touch\u201d and \u201cspreading dangerous lies\u201d after she said that an increase to the unemployment benefit Newstart would end up in the hands of drug dealers and pub owners. Cassandra Goldie, the chief executive of the Australian Council of Social Service, said Ruston should retract the comments, made at a single mother\u2019s forum in the South Australian Liberal stronghold of Barker and reported by the Murray Valley Standard this week. \u201cThe minister\u2019s out-of-touch, inexcusable comments make it clear she needs to spend more time with people on Newstart, who are skipping meals, sleeping rough and going without the very basics in our wealthy country,\u201d Goldie said on Thursday. \u201cInstead of making irresponsible, stigmatising comments, the minister should focus on getting people through tough times by increasing Newstart, which 72% of the community agrees is overdue.\u201d Ruston, who has previously acknowledged that living on Newstart is not easy, sought to play down the comments on Wednesday, describing the reporting of her remarks as \u201cmisleading\u201d and insisting she had been talking specifically about people who had addictions. But Terese Edwards, who facilitated the forum, on Wednesday confirmed to Guardian Australia that Ruston had made the comments. In a statement on Thursday, Edwards, the chief executive of the National Council for Single Mothers and their Children, went further, accusing Ruston of adding to the stigma already experienced by people on Newstart. \u201cAt the event, I asked the minister to broker a meeting between the prime minister and people on Newstart about the urgent need for a real increase to the payment after 25 years,\u201d she said. \u201cThe minister\u2019s deplorable comments make it all the more obvious why this forum needs to happen. \u201cPeople on Newstart, including 100,000 single parents trying to raise kids on next to nothing, should not have to put up with this sort of stigma while they\u2019re doing everything they can to find paid work and make ends meet.\u201d Jeremy Poxon, a spokesman for the Australian Unemployed Workers\u2019 Union, told Guardian Australia: \u201cThousands of our members have been telling minister Ruston and her government what they desperately need: money for food, rent, bills and immediate necessities so they can survive. \u201cInstead of actually listening to them, or offering any support, minister Ruston would rather spread dangerous and demeaning lies about the most disadvantaged people in our communities.\u201d As the Morrison government refuses to increase Newstart, recipients also expressed frustration at the minister responsible for the welfare payment, which has not risen in real terms in since 1994. Ruston told Sky News on Wednesday that increasing the dole would not help people receiving welfare payments. \u201cJust constantly spending more money and not getting any better result is not the right thing for us to be doing,\u201d Ruston said. \u201cWe need to make sure that we investigate every possible way that we can to start getting a better result for getting people back into work. \u201cI think the issue around people who currently find themselves unemployed is much more complex than just the safety net that is provided by the Australian government\u2019s taxpayer-funded welfare system.\u201d Welfare groups are calling for a $75-a-week increase to Newstart, which is currently about $280-a-week and has not risen in real terms since 1994. It would cost the budget $3.3bn a year. The furore over Ruston\u2019s remarks comes as the government pursues a trial to drug test 5,000 welfare recipients, which experts told a Senate inquiry on Wednesday was so \u201cfatally flawed\u201d it could not be used to \u201cscientifically inform\u201d a national rollout. The government said the proposal has been established as a trial to determine if it was effective. Ruston\u2019s office was previously contacted for comment.",

In a statement released on Thursday, the organisation said it had decided to close its doors \u201cfollowing an analysis of the organisation\u2019s future sustainability\u201d. \u201cIt is with profound sadness that the board of White Ribbon Australia informs the community and supporters that it has taken the very difficult decision to close its doors,\u201d it said. According to a notice filed with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the charity\u2019s members agreed at a general meeting on Wednesday to wind up the company. On Thursday the charity thanked its staff and volunteers, and paid tribute to other organisations and groups working against gendered violence. \u201cFor all those who are already planning for White Ribbon Day, we encourage you to continue with those plans alongside the international White Ribbon movement,\u201d it said. \u201cEven though White Ribbon Australia\u2019s journey ends here, we know that the work of our partners and communities will continue. Eliminating men\u2019s violence against women must remain a priority.\u201d According to White Ribbon Australia\u2019s most recently filed financial report, it was running at an $840,000 deficit.

Other board directors, including the former New South Wales director of public prosecutions Nicholas Cowdery, also resigned from the charity, and numerous sponsors pulled out.

Last year the charity stripped then NSW Labor leader Luke Foley of his ambassador role after accusations emerged he indecently touched a female journalist. Foley strenuously denied the allegations.

      "bodyText": "North Korea has confirmed it successfully launched a new ballistic missile from a submarine, in a move intended to raise pressure on the US as the two countries prepare to resume nuclear talks at the weekend. Wednesday\u2019s launch, the first involving a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) for three years, was Pyongyang\u2019s most provocative weapons test since it began denuclearisation talks with Washington early last year. Perfecting SLBM technology would significantly expand North Korea\u2019s military options, enabling it to deploy missiles far beyond the Korean peninsula and giving it a \u201csecond-strike\u201d capability in the event of an attack on its military bases. Missiles fired from underwater are also harder to detect before liftoff than ground-based missiles. The KCNA state news agency said the test, in waters off its east coast, marked a \u201cnew phase\u201d in containing the threat from \u201coutside forces\u201d \u2013 although it did specify the nature of that threat. \u201cThe new-type ballistic missile was fired in vertical mode\u201d in waters off Wonsan Bay on Wednesday, KCNA said, adding: \u201cThe successful new-type SLBM test-firing comes to be of great significance as it ushered in a new phase in containing the outside forces\u2019 threat to the DPRK [Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea] and further bolstering its military muscle for self-defence.\u201d Ankit Panda of the Federation of American Scientists described the missile, the Pukguksong-3, as Pyongyang\u2019s longest-range-capable solid-fuel missile, adding that Wednesday\u2019s launch was \u201cunambiguously the first nuclear-capable missile test since November 2017\u201d. \u201cKim Jong Un\u2019s \u2018rocket men\u2019 kept busy during the diplomatic charm offensives of 2018-2019,\u201d Panda added. It isn\u2019t clear if the missile was launched from a submarine, barge or some form of underwater platform. Kim Dong-yub, an analyst from Seoul\u2019s Institute for Far Eastern Studies, wrote on Facebook that the missile was probably fired from a specially built underwater barge. He said the missile is under development and that North Korea must test-fire it from a submarine before it can be deployed. North Korea began testing SLBMs in 2015 and conducted four submarine launches by August 2016, when a two-stage solid-fuel Pukguksong missile flew about 500 km (310 miles) on a lofted trajectory. That test was considered a success. The launch may be used as leverage in talks with the US due to resume at the weekend after months of stalemate, and with Pyongyang warning recently that engagement with Washington could unravel unless it comes up with new proposals by the end of the year. Pyongyang has said that denuclearisation measures are contingent on the US making reciprocal actions, including the lifting of sanctions. Kim Myong-gil, a former North Korean ambassador to Vietnam who will lead the North Korean delegation, arrived in Beijing on Thursday before flying to Stockholm, where the talks will take place, Kyodo news agency said, citing diplomatic sources. South Korea\u2019s joint chiefs of staff said the missile travelled about 450km (280 miles) in an easterly direction at a maximum altitude of 910km. Photos of the launch in the official newspaper Rodong Sinmun showed a black-and-white painted missile emerging from the water and flying into the grey sky. The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, \u201csent warm congratulations\u201d to those who had carried out the successful test-firing, KCNA said, indicating that Kim was not at the site. A State Department spokeswoman called on Pyongyang to \u201crefrain from provocations\u201d and to remain committed to the nuclear negotiations. South Korea expressed strong concern and the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, condemned the launch, saying it was a violation of UN security council resolutions. North Korea rejects those resolutions that ban Pyongyang from using ballistic missile technology, saying they are an infringement of its right to self-defence. The launch was the ninth since Donald Trump and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, met at the heavily guarded demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas in June, and came soon after Pyongyang announced it would hold working-level talks with the US on Saturday \u2013 a development that could potentially break months of stalemate over North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons programme. Talks aimed at dismantling North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programmes have been stalled since the second summit between Trump and Kim in Vietnam in February ended without a deal.",

      "bodyText": "The New South Wales Nationals and the communications minister, Paul Fletcher, have joined growing calls for the length of pre-poll voting before federal elections to be shortened. In a submission to the inquiry examining the 2019 election, Fletcher warned the record number of Australians voting in pre-poll was eroding the \u201cintegrity and quality\u201d of the electoral process. In the 2019 election 4.8 million Australians voted before election day on 18 May \u2013 31.6% of the electorate, up from 22% in 2016 \u2013 sparking concern from party organisations, which struggled to staff pre-poll centres with volunteers to distribute how-to-vote cards. The National party\u2019s NSW branch submission to the joint standing committee on electoral matters claims that pre-poll should be cut from three weeks to two. While voters should have \u201cevery possible opportunity to exercise their democratic right \u2026 the party strongly believes in ensuring voters have the opportunity to be fully informed prior to casting their ballot\u201d, it said. The NSW Nationals also complained that the Australian Electoral Commission provided election funding directly to the federal secretariat of the party, instead of the state parties which are \u201cindependent organisations\u201d which choose to affiliate in a federated structure. Fletcher\u2019s submission noted that pre-poll was intended for those \u201cphysically unable\u201d to attend a polling place on election day, not for the \u201cgreater convenience\u201d of voters. The record pre-poll result \u201cmade it more challenging for all parties to communicate their policies to voters in the lead-up to the election\u201d, he said. Fletcher said he was \u201cparticularly troubled\u201d by the AEC\u2019s \u201cpolicy of encouraging and facilitating pre-poll\u201d through a longer pre-poll period and more pre-poll centres. \u201cThis is not an appropriate decision for unelected officials to make,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a decision which should only be made by the parliament.\u201d He also criticised it for appearing to celebrate the result with \u201cpublicity material noting with satisfaction that pre-poll numbers were at record levels\u201d. Fletcher said the AEC provided just two days\u2019 notice that pre-poll would open on 29 April, creating \u201ca significant logistical challenge\u201d staffing early voting centres. Fletcher suggested pre-poll should be cut from three weeks to one, should not be offered on Saturdays and suggested a reduction in the number of pre-poll centres. LNP MP Julian Simmonds submitted that the three week pre-poll period was \u201coverly burdensome and a significant imposition on both candidates and political volunteers\u201d. He called for the period to be cut to two weeks to save on the \u201cenormous resources to sustain a presence across multiple pre-poll locations in an electorate\u201d. Simmonds also complained about third-party groups \u2013 such as Get Up, unions and the Australian Conservation Foundation \u2013 handing out how-to-vote cards which he said lead to \u201cconfusion amongst voters between legitimate candidates and those lobbying on behalf of issues\u201d. Independent MP Bob Katter also called for pre-poll to be cut to one week. Katter backed former Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce\u2019s call to break states up into sub-regions and mandate two senators represent each \u2013 a change which would provide the Nationals with a larger Senate bloc at the expense of all the other major parties which win more votes in capital cities. Political analyst Kevin Bonham noted informal voting rates above 10% in the western Sydney seats of Blaxland, Fowler, Watson, McMahon, Werriwa, Lindsay and a surge in informal voting in Mallee, a Victorian seat contested by 13 candidates. He said the rate of informal voting was a \u201cnational disgrace\u201d and called for new savings provisions so ballots that miss a number are not disregarded. Labor has urged the committee to investigate whether the digital behemoths are having a negative impact on Australian democracy after Facebook refused to take down fake news about the \u201cdeath tax\u201d circulating during the May election campaign. Civil society groups have called for the introduction of spending caps, citing Clive Palmer\u2019s record $60m expenditure on the election.",

      "bodyText": "\u201cIn a lot of ways, the book is about truth telling but you need a voice to be able to use the truth. Because the truth isn\u2019t going to change things by itself. We change things \u2013 it\u2019s about us being empowered to do that.\u201d That\u2019s how Thomas Mayor describes Finding the Heart of the Nation, a book documenting his 18-month trip carrying the Uluru Statement canvas throughout Indigenous Australia. By voice, he means Voice: the constitutionally recognised representative body for First Nations people proposed by the 2017 National Constitutional Convention, the body that emerged from the dialogue about constitutional recognition initiated in 2015. For Mayor, that representation matters above all else. Mayor describes himself as a Torres Strait Islander born and raised on Larrakia land. He learned his politics working on the Darwin waterfront, and he invokes that time to explain the necessity of a First Nations voice for Indigenous unity. \u201cBecause I\u2019m a unionist, I understand the power of collectivism. If we didn\u2019t have layers of representation in our union, we\u2019d be a rabble, an absolute mess. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people need structure and we need to make it permanent.\u201d As an official of the Maritime Union of Australia (MUA), he\u2019d been organising rallies against the closures of remote communities in Western Australia, as well as the treatment of youth in Don Dale. But he worried such actions were always shaped by others\u2019 agenda. \u201cI began to realise that our activism was missing something,\u201d he says, \u201cand I couldn\u2019t put my finger on it straight away.\u201d Invited to attend the First Nations\u2019 dialogue on constitutional recognition, Thomas became convinced that a permanent voice to parliament, even if only consultative, would help break the cycle of reactive advocacy, allowing Indigenous people to influence government decisions before they were made. With the backing of the MUA, he set out to carry the Uluru Statement to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations throughout the nation. On his travels, Mayor lugged, in a taped-together postal cylinder, the canvas itself, an artefact that speaks through form as well as content. Anangu artists adorned the statement with \u201ctjukurrpa\u201d \u2013 an untranslatable term for creation stories \u2013 before the convention delegates all recorded their names: a deliberate echo of the Yirrkala bark petitions and the Barunga Statement, two of the many previous attempts by Indigenous people to negotiate with white Australia. In his book, Mayor records conversations with more than 20 community leaders including Djawa Yunupingu of the Gumatj clan of the Yol\u014bu nation; Darlene Mansell, a Moonbird, Pakana woman; Barbara Shaw of the Kaytetye, Arrernte, Warlpiri and Warumungu; and Sammy Wilson of the Anangu. He also chats about reconciliation with the American actor and civil rights activist Danny Glover, who cites James Baldwin\u2019s argument: \u201cPeople are trapped in history and history is trapped in them\u201d. (Mayor jokes that he almost got Glover killed at a Naidoc meeting, with 300 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders rushing him for selfies.) If people in Finding the Heart of the Nation represent particular places, the places often invoke specific struggles. He travels, for instance, to Jimparrak, where a nine-year strike by the Gurindji people against one of the largest pastoralist companies in the world inspired the modern land rights movement. Such was the significance of the Wave Hill dispute that Mayor argues the old cattle station \u201cshould be the most celebrated place in the nation\u201d. Elsewhere, in a visit to the Australian Hall in Elizabeth Street, Sydney, he recalls the Day of Mourning staged by Indigenous activists on January 26 1938. Now a declared an \u201cAboriginal Heritage Site\u201d because of its role in that protest, the building illustrates the ability of Indigenous people to reclaim even the most unlikely structures \u2013 much as the Uluru Statement seeks to do with the Australian constitution. The statement proposes a Makarrata Commission \u201cto supervise a process of agreement-making between governments and First Nations and truth-telling about our history\u201d. The Yol\u014bu word \u201cMakarrata\u201d, Mayor explains, refers to reconciliation after a struggle, ideally leaving the disputing parties with a stronger relationship than before. But that healing depends on justice \u2013 and, for Mayor, justice requires constitutional change to mandate a consultative body for Indigenous people. He\u2019s aware that many battles lie ahead but thinks politicians, rather than the public, pose the biggest obstacle to real change. That\u2019s why he urges supporters of the Uluru Statement to speak up. \u2018\u2018I want people to do any action within their capacity and not feel like any action is too small to do, whether it\u2019s writing to a member of parliament or joining a group and organising something bigger. I want everyone to get active on this.\u201d For him, it\u2019s a cause with implications for all Australians. \u201cI think it\u2019s important for the climate change struggle too,\u201d he muses. \u201cI think if Indigenous people had a voice in decision-making a long time ago, I don\u2019t think we would have been so reckless with how we treat the environment.\u201d \u2022 Finding the Heart of the Nation by Thomas Mayor is out now through Hardie Grant",

The decision was announced at the high court in Christchurch, where the accused man, Australian Brenton Tarrant, appeared via a video link from a high-security prison in Auckland. Around 80 members of the Muslim community were in attendance, Stuff reported, with many concerned they would not be able to attend the trial if it was moved to another city. Tarrant\u2019s defence lawyer Shane Tait unexpectedly withdrew the application to have the trial venue moved, at a hearing that lasted 10 minutes. Tarrant\u2019s next court appearance is scheduled for 12 December. Tarrant, a suspected white supremacist, pleaded not guilty in June to 92 charges against him, including of murder and terrorism. He is now being held in isolation at New Zealand\u2019s only maximum security prison, Paremoremo, north of Auckland. The corrections department admitted in August that the 28-year-old has successfully sent and received postal letters with other white supremacists from his jail cell. Tarrant has also made a number of complaints regarding the conditions of his detention to the Human Rights Commission.

The company said it took the ad down because it violated Facebook\u2019s policies, but not because the 30-second video spot is misleading. Instead, Facebook blocked the ads because they contain profanity. </p> \n  <p>The video spot, which can be viewed on YouTube <a href=\"https://youtu.be/bbixdV2F6Ts\">here</a>, falsely claims that Joe Biden \u201cpromised Ukraine a billion dollars if they fired the prosecutor investigating his son\u2019s company\u201d. As the Guardian and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/09/23/fact-checking-trumps-latest-claims-biden-ukraine/\">fact-checkers</a> have pointed out repeatedly, this is a mischaracterization of Biden\u2019s role in US foreign policy when he was vice president. <br></p> \n  <p>The video uses a snippet of audio of Biden discussing Ukraine during a 2018 appearance before the Council on Foreign Relations, when he said, \u201cIf the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money. Well son of a bitch, he got fired.\u201d The editing makes it appear that Biden is admitting to extorting Ukraine on behalf of his son, rather than carrying out the Obama administration\u2019s foreign policy. The Washington Post <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/09/23/fact-checking-trumps-latest-claims-biden-ukraine/\">Fact Checker</a> column wrote of this speech: \u201cBiden is certainly being self-congratulatory here.

It was a long one involving a lot of incoherent and rambling answers from the president. But here\u2019s my best shot of at some of the most important comments relating to impeachment and the ongoing Ukraine scandal. </p> \n  <p><strong>Firstly, Trump <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/02/us/politics/adam-schiff-whistleblower.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage\">responded to a New York Times report</a>, published earlier today, stating that the whistleblower had approached a House Intelligence Committee staff aide days before filing his complaint. The report states that the committee chairman, Adam Schiff, was later made aware of the nature of the allegations but was not given any information on the whistleblower\u2019s identity.</strong> A spokesman for Schiff has confirmed parts of this reporting, and stated it is standard procedure for the committee to offer advice to whistleblowers on how to file complaints. </p> \n  <p>T<strong>rump responded to the report during the press conference, making wildly unsubstantiated claims suggesting that:</strong> \u201cI think he [Schiff] probably helped write it [the whistleblower complaint].\u201d He added: \u201cHe [Schiff] knew long before, and he helped write it too.\u201d </p> \n  <p>There is no reporting to suggest this occurred and Trump provided no evidence. </p> \n  <p><strong>Secondly, Trump indicated he plans to personally sue people involved in the special counsel\u2019s investigation into Russian inference in the 2016 election.</strong> He did not give specific names when invited to by a reporter. But he said he and his personal attorney Rudy Guiliani were exploring the possibility. He said: </p> \n  <p>\u201cI probably will, I was going to definitely, but I probably will be bringing litigation against a lot of people having to do with the corrupt investigation into the 2016 election.

He also tweeted a bizarre video featuring the song \u201cPhotograph\u201d by Canadian rock band Nickelback and picture of Joe and Hunter Biden golfing with Ukrainian energy executives. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo admitted that he listened in on Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with the Ukrainian president, after previously evading questions about his knowledge of the call. House Democrats warned the Trump administration against stonewalling their impeachment inquiry and threatened subpoenas on Friday if the administration failed to comply with their requests. Democratic presidential candidates participated in a gun safety forum. They all largely agreed that background checks and assault weapon bans were necessary. Bernie Sanders did not attend the forum; he was recovering after being treated for a blocked artery. The state department inspector general called an urgent meeting with Senate and House committee staffers, purportedly to give them documents related to the Trump-Ukraine inquiry. Instead, he provided them with disinformation about Joe Biden and his son that Trump. The Trump administration plans to collect DNA from hundreds of thousands of immigrants in federal custody and enter it into a criminal database. Lawyers with the Justice Department urged a federal judge to delay ruling on whether or not Donald Trump should be made to turn over his tax returns as part of a criminal probe by the Manhattan district attorney. The justice department appeared to side with Trump in his ongoing efforts to skirt a grand jury subpoena seeking tax records from his longtime accounting firm. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. is seeking the records as he investigates the Trump Organization\u2019s involvement in hush-money payments made to pornographic actor Stormy Daniels and model Karen McDougal. More from the AP: Five Washington Justice Department lawyers and officials were listed as submitting arguments that pertained to procedural matters. They said the judge should \u201csupport interim relief as necessary to allow for appropriate briefing of the weighty constitutional issues involved.\u201d The Justice Department lawyers said U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero should retain jurisdiction of the case, rather than let a state court decide any issues. Vance, a Democrat, has said any dispute should be decided in state court. Trump\u2019s lawyers have said the investigation is politically motivated and the quest for his tax records should be stopped because he is immune from any criminal probe as long as he is president. Attorneys for Vance counter that Trump\u2019s immunity should not interrupt a probe that includes a look into the actions of individuals and businesses other than Trump, especially since the statute of limitations is in play. Congress is authorized by the Constitution to investigate presidents and remove them from office, but the law is unclear as to whether a sitting president can be indicted and prosecuted in a state or federal court. The Guardian\u2019s Julia Carrie Wong reports from San Francisco: Facebook has blocked a Donald Trump campaign advertisement that promoted a false conspiracy theory about Joe Biden and Ukraine. The company said it took the ad down because it violated Facebook\u2019s policies, but not because the 30-second video spot is misleading. Instead, Facebook blocked the ads because they contain profanity. The video spot, which can be viewed on YouTube here, falsely claims that Joe Biden \u201cpromised Ukraine a billion dollars if they fired the prosecutor investigating his son\u2019s company\u201d. As the Guardian and fact-checkers have pointed out repeatedly, this is a mischaracterization of Biden\u2019s role in US foreign policy when he was vice president. The video uses a snippet of audio of Biden discussing Ukraine during a 2018 appearance before the Council on Foreign Relations, when he said, \u201cIf the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money. Well son of a bitch, he got fired.\u201d The editing makes it appear that Biden is admitting to extorting Ukraine on behalf of his son, rather than carrying out the Obama administration\u2019s foreign policy. The Washington Post Fact Checker column wrote of this speech: \u201cBiden is certainly being self-congratulatory here. But, as noted, Biden\u2019s action was coordinated with other major players in the region and celebrated at the time because Shokin was widely seen as a failure.\u201d Facebook has faced criticism in recent days over its policy not to apply fact-checking to political ads. Versions of the ad were viewed by more than 1m Facebook users before they were taken down, according to data from the Facebook political ad archive. \u201cOur systems disapproved the ads because they contain profanity,\u201d a Facebook spokesperson said by email. \u201cWe have reached out to the campaign to let them know they must edit it before it can run again.\u201d Indeed, new versions of the ad with the same misleading narrative are now running with the word \u201cbitch\u201d bleeped out. The Facebook spokesperson did not immediately respond to questions about why the ads were only \u201cdisapproved\u201d by the company\u2019s systems after being viewed more than 1m times. One of the last democratic holdouts on the impeachment issue, New York representative Max Rose has expressed his support for the inquiry. A majority of House democrats have already said they support the Trump-Ukerakine impeachment inquiry. The Guardian\u2019s Aben\u00e9 Clayton reports from Las Vegas: The 2020 gun forum is wrapping up with Senator Kamala Harris as the last candidate to take the stage alongside moderator and MSNBC host Craig Melvin. The crowd was filled with representatives from national violence prevention groups like March for Our Lives, Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, and Moms Demand Action as well as community organizers from Chicago and New Orleans who were there to be a visible force for addressing the community violence that is often overlooked in the national gun conversation. Nine of the top candidates spoke; Bernie Sanders did not attend because he is recovering from a heart surgery. Each candidate commented on The October 1 mass shooting in Vegas where a gunman killed 58 people, and they all emphasized their support of assault weapons bans and background checks. The only piece of gun control that was not universally accepted by candidates was the mandatory assault weapon buyback program that Beto O\u2019Rourke has been pushing. During his time on the forum stage South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg voiced his disagreement over the feasibility of Texas Congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s proposed federal assault weapon buyback program Buttigieg referred to it as \u201ca shiny object\u201d that could distract lawmakers from accomplishing other gun control goals. O\u2019Rourke told reporters after his time on stage: \u201cHow in the world can you say that to survivors of mass shootings? I was really offended by those comments.\u201d Buttigieg \u201crepresents a kind of politics that is focused on poll testing and focus groups before arriving to a conclusion\u201d, O\u2019Rourke added. \u201cI think our politics has to be about doing the right thing.\u201d Trump involved Pence in efforts to pressure Ukraine\u2019s leader The president involved vice president Mike Pence in his efforts to pressure the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden, the Washington Post reports: Trump instructed Pence not to attend the inauguration of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in May \u2014 an event White House officials had pushed to put on the vice president\u2019s calendar \u2014 when Ukraine\u2019s new leader was seeking recognition and support from Washington, the officials said. Months later, the president used Pence to tell Zelensky that U.S. aid was still being withheld while demanding more aggressive action on corruption, officials said. At that time \u2014 following Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Zelenksy \u2014 the Ukrainians probably understood action on corruption to include the investigation of former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. Officials close to Pence insist that he was unaware of Trump\u2019s efforts to press Zelensky for damaging information about Biden and his son, who had served on the board of an obscure Ukrainian gas company, when his father was overseeing U.S. policy on Ukraine. Pence\u2019s activities occurred amid several indications of the president\u2019s hidden agenda. Among them were the abrupt removal of the U.S. ambassador to Kiev; the visible efforts by the president\u2019s lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, to insert himself in the U.S.-Ukraine relationship; as well as alarms being raised inside the White House even before the emergence of an extraordinary whistleblower complaint about Trump\u2019s conduct. Lindsay Graham asks countries to cooperate with the Trump administration\u2019s investigation into the origins of the Mueller investigation The republican senator sent a letter addressed to the leaders of the UK, Australia and Italy asking them to cooperate with attorney general William Barr as investigates the origins of the Mueller report, which brought forth evidence that Donald Trump may have obstructed justice. Barr has traveled to the UK and Italy to chase conspiracy theories around the origins of the Mueller investigation. \u201cI write to request your country\u2019s continued cooperation with Attorney General Barr as the Department of Justice continues to investigate the origins and extent of foreign influence in the 2016 U.S. presidential election,\u201d Graham wrote. State department IG reportedly distributed disinformation The state department inspector general distributed dozens of documents containing unproven claims about Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, according to CNN. IG Steve Linick asked to meet with the staff of several House and Senate committees today to provide them with documents from State\u2019s acting legal adviser related to Ukraine, according to multiple reports. The documents in question appear to repeat the same unverified allegations against Biden that Rudy Giuliani and other Trump advisers and aides have been making publicly. Per CNN, which obtained a copy of the documents: The documents include claims against the Bidens as well as charges against former US Ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, who was recalled earlier this year and whom President Donald Trump criticized in his July call with the Ukrainian president. The packet also included internal State Department emails from officials discussing articles critical of Yovanovitch, calling some of it a \u201cfake narrative.\u201d There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. State Department inspector general Steve Linick told Congress that the State Department\u2019s office of legal counsel provided the documents to the inspector general in May. The inspector general provided them to the FBI, and the FBI did not object to the documents being released to Congress, which could suggest the FBI is not actively investigating the matter. The administration is moving forward with plans to collect DNA from hundreds of thousands of immigrants in federal custody and enter into a national criminal database, according to multiple reports. The Justice Department is developing regulations that would allow immigration officers to collect genetic information from most migrants detained at the border and at federal facilities. This would expand a pilot program that uses rapid DNA technology to collect data from families suspected of child trafficking. Once DNA is collected, it would be transferred to an FBI\u2019s database currently used to store information about people accused or convicted of serious crimes. Elizabeth Warren sent her 2020 opponent Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign team dinner, in a gesture of goodwill as Sanders recovers from heart surgery. Apprently, there were cookies. US imposes tariffs on European wine and whiskey The administration announced it ill be imposing tariffs on $7.5bn in European imports, beginning Oct. 18, over European Union subsidies to the airplane maker Airbus. From the AP: The administration received a green light earlier Wednesday from the World Trade Organization, which ruled that the United States could impose the tariffs as retaliation for illegal aid that the 28-country EU gave to Airbus in its competition with its American rival Boeing. Culminating a 15-year fight over the EU\u2019s subsidizing of Airbus, the administration\u2019s Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said it plans to publish a list of targeted products later Wednesday or on Thursday. Reports indicate that the state department inspector general, Steve Linick, has briefed a number of House and Senate committees about recent instances of \u201cpolitical retaliation\u201d by department leaders against career staff over Ukraine. Linick left Congress moments ago and we\u2019re expecting further details on the briefing shortly. Trump led a rambling joint press conference with the Finnish president, Sauli Niinist\u00f6, in which he accused the Democrat Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House intelligence committee, of co-authoring a whistleblower complaint detailing Trump\u2019s attempts to dig up dirt on Joe Biden\u2019s family by pushing the Ukraine president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to commission an investigation into the former vice-president\u2019s son. Trump cited no evidence for this allegation. Bernie Sanders has tweeted his thanks to supporters and well-wishers after he was hospitalized due to a blocked artery. And it appears that Linick is done with the briefing. This video just posted shows him leaving Capitol Hill. We\u2019re finally getting some more information on what the State Department Inspector General is briefing Congress about today. According to Reuters, which is quoting two \u201cfamiliar sources\u201d Steve Linick will tell lawmakers about recent instances of \u201cpotential political retaliation\u201d by department leadership against career officials over Ukraine. Here\u2019s the full report. The two sources familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity, did not provide details about what the potential retaliation may have involved. The briefing is part of the Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives\u2019 impeachment inquiry into whether President Donald Trump sought help from Ukraine to investigate his political rival, Democrat Joe Biden, the former vice president. Following a whistleblower complaint last week, Democrats are looking into a July 25 call in which Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Biden, a leading Democrat seeking to run against Republican Trump in 2020. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is on a three-day trip to Italy, on Wednesday confirmed that he had listened in on the call, saying the conversation had centered on U.S. policy priorities. State Department Inspector General (IG) Steve Linick, who conducts independent oversight to combat waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement at the agency, was to provide the closed-door briefing to eight congressional committees at 3 p.m. (1900 GMT). A notice about the inspector general\u2019s briefing said it would concern Ukraine and that Linick would bring documents provided by the Department\u2019s acting legal advisor, said a third source who spoke on condition of anonymity. The panels invited are the House and Senate committees on intelligence, foreign affairs, government oversight and appropriations, congressional aides said. The State Department did not respond to requests for comment. If the House inquiry results in articles of impeachment, or formal charges, against Trump, there would be a trial in the Senate on whether to remove him from office. The president\u2019s fellow Republicans control the Senate and have shown little appetite for removing him. The impeachment inquiry has begun to ensnare both career and politically appointed officials in the State Department. Bernie Sanders has tweeted his thanks to well wishers after he underwent heart surgery for a blocked artery. He has suspended campaign appearances but used his condition remind supporters of a key campaign goal: medicare for all. OK - here are some takeaways from that press conference. It was a long one involving a lot of incoherent and rambling answers from the president. But here\u2019s my best shot of at some of the most important comments relating to impeachment and the ongoing Ukraine scandal. Firstly, Trump responded to a New York Times report, published earlier today, stating that the whistleblower had approached a House Intelligence Committee staff aide days before filing his complaint. The report states that the committee chairman, Adam Schiff, was later made aware of the nature of the allegations but was not given any information on the whistleblower\u2019s identity. A spokesman for Schiff has confirmed parts of this reporting, and stated it is standard procedure for the committee to offer advice to whistleblowers on how to file complaints. Trump responded to the report during the press conference, making wildly unsubstantiated claims suggesting that: \u201cI think he [Schiff] probably helped write it [the whistleblower complaint].\u201d He added: \u201cHe [Schiff] knew long before, and he helped write it too.\u201d There is no reporting to suggest this occurred and Trump provided no evidence. Secondly, Trump indicated he plans to personally sue people involved in the special counsel\u2019s investigation into Russian inference in the 2016 election. He did not give specific names when invited to by a reporter. But he said he and his personal attorney Rudy Guiliani were exploring the possibility. He said: \u201cI probably will, I was going to definitely, but I probably will be bringing litigation against a lot of people having to do with the corrupt investigation into the 2016 election. And I have every right to.\u201d It\u2019s pretty difficult to interpret that at this stage given the president did not cite any specific grounds or names. Finally, Trump continues to show complete contempt for the White House press corps. Here\u2019s the exchange where he starts bossing a reporter around and making derisive comments about the media: I\u2019m still parsing that bizarre press conference. But meanwhile, on Capitol Hill: This press conference is quickly descending into a farce as Trump starts bossing reporters around, describing them as \u201cfake news media\u201d as they push the president on what he wanted the Ukrainian government to do to Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. Trump then instructs a reporter to ask Finland president Sauli Niinist\u00f6 a question. The reporter obliges. Trump then attempts to answer the question on the president\u2019s behalf. I\u2019ll type a few highlights as it wraps up. We\u2019re switching now to a joint press conference being held at the White House with Donald Trump and Finland president Sauli Niinist\u00f6. You can watch that below: The 2020 Gun Safety Forum is underway in Las Vegas. Nine of the top presidential candidates are receiving 20-25 minutes of solo stage time to talk about their platforms on gun control. Staff with March for our Lives and the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence organized the event and invited local groups and community organizers to ask candidates questions and network amongst each other. The forum comes one day after the 2 year anniversary of the October 1, 2017 mass shooting at the Route 91 music festival which left 58 people dead. And organizers hope to expand the conversation from mass shootings to include suicides, domestic violence, and urban community violence which account for the majority of gun deaths. Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak, Nevada\u2019s first democratic governor in 20 years and Assemblywoman Sandra Jauregui, who survived the 2017 shooting gave opening remarks. Jauregui recalled dropping to the ground and having her husband lay on top of her to block the gunfire. Sisolak tearfully recalled walking through the fairgrounds in the aftermath of the Route 91 shooting. He highlighted the sweeping gun reforms that came after the shooting. Reforms include universal background checks and banning bumpstocks, the gun accessory that was used during the Route 91 shooting. \u201cWe will not be defined by the evil acts of a lone monster two years ago but rather by resilience,\u201d Sisolak said. The Democratic National Committee has announced that 12 candidates have now qualified for the next presidential primary debate in Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio on 15 October. Those candidates, in alphabetical order, are: Vice President Joe Biden Sen. Cory Booker Mayor Pete Buttigieg Sec. Julian Castro Rep. Tulsi Gabbard Sen. Kamala Harris Sen. Amy Klobuchar Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke Sen. Bernie Sanders Mr. Tom Steyer Sen. Elizabeth Warren Mr. Andrew Yang Here\u2019s where things stand after an incredibly dramatic morning in the world of US politics. Top House Democrats Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff warned the Trump administration against stonewalling on the impeachment inquiry and accused Donald Trump of inciting violence with intimidatory tactics against the whistleblower and witnesses in the Ukraine scandal. Bernie Sanders was hospitalized in Las Vegas after experiencing chest pains on the campaign trail yesterday and has had a procedure to treat a blocked artery. The 2020 Democratic candidate has canceled campaign events until further notice. State department inspector general Steve Linick is to brief Senate and House committee staffers behind closed doors on Capitol Hill this afternoon, after requesting urgent meeting. Details are scarce but it\u2019s said to involve documents related to the Trump-Ukraine scandal. House Democrats threatened subpoenas on Friday if the office of the president fails to comply with requests from Congress relating to the impeachment inquiry. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo admitted he listened in on Donald Trump\u2019s phone call in July with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Pompeo skipped around questions on his and Trump\u2019s appropriateness of conduct and summarized the growing scandal as \u201call this noise\u201d. Trump has used a brief press appearance at the Oval Office to lay into House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff again. Trump\u2019s comments were riddled with misrepresentations and inflammatory language leveled at Democrats and members of the press pool. He says that Schiff should be investigated for treason over his questioning of the acting DNI Joseph Maguire in Congress last week. \u201cHe [Schiff] made up my conversation. He actually made it up. It should be treasonous. He made it up. Every word of it. Made it up. And read to Congress as though I said it. I\u2019ll tell you what, he should be forced to resign. Adam Schiff, he\u2019s a low life. He should be forced to resign. He took a perfect conversation, realized he couldn\u2019t read it to congress because it was a very nice conversation,\u201d Trump says. The comments Trump appears to be referring to are remarks Schiff made at the hearing, which he clearly signposted beforehand as a paraphrase that did not include direct quotation. Here\u2019s some video of the President. The Associated Press has more details on Bernie Sanders current condition following heart surgery for a blocked artery. A top official in Bernie Sanders\u2019 presidential campaign says the Democratic candidate is in Las Vegas where he\u2019s resting after having a heart procedure for a blocked artery. Campaign adviser Jeff Weaver says that Sanders\u2019 wife, Jane O\u2019Meara Sanders, is on her way to Las Vegas. Weaver isn\u2019t saying whether the Vermont senator is still hospitalized. O\u2019Meara Sanders says in an email that her husband \u201cwas doing really well.\u201d The Trump campaign have just released a new, inflammatory and misleading attack advert reusing the \u201cCoup\u201d rhetoric tweeted by the president earlier in the week. According to the campaign\u2019s press release: The spot will be mixed into an existing $8 million ad buy the campaign previously announced. Combined with a separate $2 million buy made by the Republican National Committee with different ads, the total buy is $10 million. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Congressman Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House intelligence committee, delivered a stern warning to the White House: attempts to \u201cstonewall\u201d the impeachment inquiry \u201cwill be considered further evidence of obstruction of justice\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re not fooling around here,\u201d Schiff said, speaking at an unusually crowded press conference. Pelosi said Trump\u2019s threats against the whistleblower and officials who spoke with the whistleblower are \u201cdangerous\u201d. The whistleblower has the right under statue to remain anonymous and we will do everything in our power to make sure that that whistleblower is protected,\u201d Schiff said. He said Trump\u2019s attacks were engaging in \u201ca blatant effort to intimidate witnesses, it\u2019s an incitement of violence. I would hope that we\u2019re starting to see members of both parties speaking out against attacking this Whistleblower and others that have pertinent information.\u201d \u201cThe president probably doesn\u2019t realize how dangerous his statement is,\u201d Pelosi added. Schiff outlined the actions taken by the three key committees leading the impeachment inquiry. He said the chairman expect Rudy Giuliani to comply with the subpoena they issued on Monday. He said they are \u201cdeeply concerned about Secretary Pompeo\u2019s effort now to potentially interfere with witnesses whose testimony is needed before our committee.\u201d Congressman Elijah Cummings, the chairman of the Oversight and Reform Committee, notified the panel on Wednesday of his intention to subpoena the White House if it did not comply by Friday with a request for documents related to Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukrianian leaders to investigate Biden. \u201cI do not take this step lightly,\u201d Cummings said in a statement. \u201cOver the past several weeks, the committees tried several times to obtain voluntary compliance with our requests for documents, but the White House has refused to engage with \u2014 or even respond to \u2014 the committees.\u201d Kurt Volker, the former US special envoy to Ukraine, who resigned from his post last week, is due to appear before the committee on Thursday. Next week, Marie Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine who was ousted from her post in May, will also sit for a joint deposition with the committees. \u201cWe\u2019re very busy,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cWe are proceeding deliberately but at the same time we feel a real sense of urgency here.\u201d Both defended the inquiry against attacks by Republicans, some of who have conceded that it was problematic but does not amount to impeachment. Pelosi said Trump\u2019s behavior on the call, which Democrats allege amounts to an attempt by a president to solicit foreign intervention in a US election, is \u201cabsolutely\u201d serious enough to be an impeachable offense. She says he undermined national security, his oath of office and the US Constitution. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a set of circumstances that would have alarmed the Founders more than what\u2019s on that call,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a more corrupt course of conduct.\u201d Clearly President Trump was watching that House Democratic press conference. He has taken to Twitter posting a typically furious, factually inaccurate and, this time, expletive ridden diatribe. Candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination have begun sending well wishes to Senator Bernie Sanders, after his campaign announced he was hospitalized due to a blocked artery. Sanders has canceled campaign events as he undergoes recovery from heart surgery. My colleague Lauren Gambino is at the press conference in DC: Schiff provides an update on the status of the House impeachment inquiry. He goes over the status of subpoenas issued to key players and departments at the centre of the Trump-Ukraine scandal. He then levels a direct attack on Mike Pompeo. He states: \u201cWe are deeply concerned about secretary Pompeo\u2019s effort to potentially interfere with witnesses who are set to appear before out committee.\u201d He adds, of the inquiry as a whole: \u201cWe are proceeding deliberately, but at the same time we feel a real sense of urgency.\u201d Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff have started a morning press conference. You can watch it here: Some breaking news from the campaign of US senator Bernie Sanders, who has fallen ill and has cancelled campaign events \u201cuntil further notice\u201d. Here\u2019s the full statement: During a campaign event yesterday evening, Sen. Sanders experienced some chest discomfort. Following medical evaluation and testing he was found to have a blockage in one artery and two stents were successfully inserted. Sen. Sanders is conversing and in good spirits. He will be resting up over the next few days. We are canceling his events and appearances until further notice, and we will continue to provide appropriate updates. Here\u2019s some more context on the State Department Inspector General\u2019s closed door \u201curgent briefing\u201d later today. We\u2019re expecting Steve Linick to brief a number of Senate and House committee staffers this afternoon. While we don\u2019t know the precise details of the briefing, ABC News, which first reported the meetings, says the matter concerns documents obtained from the department\u2019s Office of the Legal Adviser related to the State Department and Ukraine. Linick was appointed to his post under the Obama administration in 2013 and previously oversaw the investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server. The career government official previously served as executive director of the Department of Justice\u2019s National Procurement Fraud Task Force and as deputy chief of the fraud section in the DOJ Criminal Division from 2006 to 2010. He was also an assistant US attorney in California and Virginia. Although, to stress again, we don\u2019t know the details of this closed door briefing, there is predictable speculation on Twitter: The impeachment inquiry continues to gain pace. House Democrats have announced they plan to subpoena the White House on Friday if the office of the president fails to comply with requests from Congress. Lets return to some of the president\u2019s inflammatory tweeting last night, in which he described the House impeachment inquiry as a \u201cCOUP\u201d. We won\u2019t embed the tweets here or reprint the contents due to their inflammatory and misleading nature, but they\u2019re available to view here if you want to take a look. As you\u2019d expect the comments are drawing serious criticism from a number of high profile Democrat. Probably the most newsworthy of all these is from California senator and presidential candidate Kamala Harris, who issued a press release this morning saying she has written to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, requesting Trump\u2019s account be suspended. The letter cites a number of recent inflammatory messages, including Trump\u2019s suggestion that House Intelligence Committee Chairman should be arrested for treason. Here\u2019s an extract from the letter her campaign attached to the press release. Mr. Dorsey: I write to call your attention to activity that President Trump has been engaged in on his Twitter account, which appears to violate the terms of the user agreement that your company requires all users on the platform adhere to. Twitter\u2019s user agreement specifically states that users \u201cmay not engage in the targeted harassment of someone, or incite other people to do so,\u201d which includes \u201cviolence against an individual or a group of people.\u201d Furthermore, the agreement states that the platform considers abusive behavior as \u201can attempt to harass, intimidate, or silence someone else\u2019s voice,\u201d and that it prohibits \u201cthe glorification of violence.\u201d In recent days, President Trump published the following tweets from his Twitter account to target, harass, and attempt to out the whistleblower who set forth credible allegations that the President has abused his power by urging a foreign government to investigate a domestic political rival. The letter concludes: No user, regardless of their job, wealth, or stature should be exempt from abiding by Twitter\u2019s user agreement, not even the President of the United States. Some more context on Secretary Pompeo\u2019s admission that he took part in the July phone call between Donald Trump and Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Pompeo\u2019s involvement in the call (he listened in to the conversation and does not appear to have actively participated) was first reported by the Wall Street Journal last week. Pompeo\u2019s admission, made earlier today on an official trip to the Vatican, confirms this reporting. Although Pompeo has sought to downplay the relevance of his participation, describing it as part of normal state department business, that explanation only takes you so far. Aside from the substance of the call, which involved Trump pushing Zelenskiy to commence a domestic investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden with the assistance of his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, Pompeo has also pleaded ignorance over the existence of the conversation in previous interviews. When reports of the whistleblower complaint first emerged in last month, Pompeo was asked by ABC News about his knowledge of the conversation between Trump and Zelenskiy. His response, which I will publish in full below, was particularly evasive, and implied he was not aware of the nature of the conversation, which we now know he was participating in. ABC: And I want to turn to this whistleblower complaint, Mr. Secretary. The complaint involving the President and a phone call with a foreign leader to the director of national intelligence inspector general. That\u2019s where the complaint was launched by the whistle-blower. The Wall Street Journal is reporting that President Trump pressed the president of Ukraine eight times to work with Rudy Giuliani to investigate Joe Biden\u2019s son. What do you know about those conversations? POMPEO: So, you just gave me a report about a I.C. whistle-blower complaint, none of which I\u2019ve seen. I can tell you about this administration\u2019s policies with Ukraine. I remember the previous administration was begged -- begged by the Ukrainian people to deliver defensive arms, so that they could protect themselves from Vladimir Putin and Russia. And they gave them blankets. This administration took seriously the responsibility of the Ukrainian people. We\u2019ve provided now on multiple occasions resources, so that the -- the Ukrainians can defend themselves. We\u2019ve worked on that. We -- we\u2019re working -- we\u2019ll see President Zelensky this week. We want a good relationship with the Ukrainian people. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of US politics.
