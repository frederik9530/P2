True, back in the autumn of 2016, he had also inflicted the first defeat to be endured by Guardiola since his arrival in English football.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/16/pep-guardiola-praise-mauricio-pochettino-manchester-city-tottenham\">Pep Guardiola says Mauricio Pochettino does not believe his praise is genuine</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>There was also no escaping the reality that, before their trip to the Etihad Stadium, Tottenham are the only side to have defeated Manchester City since the end of January, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/apr/09/tottenham-hotspur-manchester-city-champions-league-quarter-final-first-leg-match-report\" title=\"\">courtesy of Heung-min Son\u2019s goal in the first leg of the Champions League semi-final</a> in early April.

      "bodyText": "Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s patience wore thin at suggestions he, perhaps more than most managers plying their trade in the Premier League, may best know how to rattle Pep Guardiola. Yes, a decade ago, he had achieved the first win of his coaching career by steering Espanyol to an improbable success across the city at Guardiola\u2019s all\u2011conquering Barcelona. True, back in the autumn of 2016, he had also inflicted the first defeat to be endured by Guardiola since his arrival in English football. There was also no escaping the reality that, before their trip to the Etihad Stadium, Tottenham are the only side to have defeated Manchester City since the end of January, courtesy of Heung-min Son\u2019s goal in the first leg of the Champions League semi-final in early April. The champions are not due to meet another member of last season\u2019s elite six until a collision with Liverpool in November, so it is easy to see why the rest of the division might be pinning their hopes on Pochettino conjuring a way to stall City\u2019s progress. If Pochettino\u2019s masterplan is wrecked on Saturday, it is conceivable City\u2019s winning streak may have extended to a record 25 league games by the time they arrive at Anfield. So it is all on the Argentinian. \u201cI hate this, I promise, when it is [billed as] \u2018a fight between one person and another\u2019, rather than a competition between teams,\u201d he said, rocking back in his chair in mock exasperation on the eve of Tottenham\u2019s trip north. \u201cIt is not me against another coach. It is not me and Pep. \u201cThe best way to see who is \u2018the best\u2019 would be to put these \u2018brave managers\u2019 in a ring and fight, like Anthony Joshua. \u201cI look so brave on the touchline because I know that is never going to happen, so I shout and everything.

We are brave, we try to move forward, we try to think about us before we think about the opponent. I don\u2019t know if that is the key to sometimes beating a team like Manchester City.\u201d That willingness to be bold and take the game to the champions, where others shrink and vainly attempt to smother with blanket defence, would appear to be one explanation for Spurs\u2019 relatively encouraging record in these fixtures. The tactic is risky. Pochettino has endured resounding defeats to City in the past few years, too, and there are few teams who can resist when they click fully into rhythm. Yet his own team\u2019s forte remains its fluent creativity and bite up front. They scored three in the second leg at the Etihad Stadium to prevail, after that excruciating VAR check, on away goals even without the injured Harry Kane. A few days later, they counted themselves unlucky to have succumbed to Phil Foden\u2019s early winner having created presentable opportunities in a lower-key Premier League rematch at the same venue. They will be blunted slightly this time round by the absence of the suspended Son and with Dele Alli only recently returned to training outside after hamstring trouble. Then there is the dilemma currently posed by Christian Eriksen. The midfielder, now into the last year of his contract and unlikely to agree new terms having set his heart upon a new challenge, began last Saturday on the bench, but Aston Villa were only prised apart once he had been summoned on after the break.

      "bodyText": "The former Liverpool playmaker Philippe Coutinho is on the verge of joining Bayern Munich on a season-long loan. The Brazil international, who was left out of Barcelona\u2019s squad for their La Liga opener against Athletic Bilbao on Friday \u2013 which they lost 1-0 \u2013 looks set to join the German champions following a summer of speculation. His loan deal is expected to include an option for a permanent move. \u201cWe can confirm that there is an agreement in principle for the loan of Coutinho to Bayern,\u201d said Barcelona\u2019s club director, Guillermo Amor, before the league match. \u201cWe just have to finalise the deal.\u201d Bayern\u2019s sporting director, Hasan Salihamidzic, added: \u201cI can confirm that [chief executive] Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and I were in Barcelona and we have reached an agreement with the club, player and agent,\u201d Salihamidzic was quoted as telling the broadcaster ZDF. \u201cOnly a few details are still to be sorted out. We are very happy that we will bring this player to Bayern.\u201d The 27-year-old joined Barcelona from Liverpool in a \u00a3142m deal in January 2018 but has struggled to find his form in Spain and was linked with loan moves to Tottenham, Arsenal and even Manchester United during the summer window. He is pencilled in to have his Bayern medical next week. Coutinho has made 75 appearances in all for Barcelona, scoring 21 goals, and was part of the side beaten in the semi-finals of the Champions League by the eventual winners, Liverpool. Bayern\u2019s coach, Niko Kovac, who saw his side drop two points at home in a 2-2 draw with Herha Berlin in their opening game of the Bundesliga season, also welcomed the impending arrival of Coutinho. \u201cI am of the opinion that not only FC Bayern, but the entire Bundesliga and all of Germany can look forward to welcoming such a top player here in this league,\u201d he said. Bayern also announced the \u201cimminent signing\u201d of 20-year-old French midfielder Micka\u00ebl Cuisance from Borussia Monchengladbach. On the pitch, Kovac admitted his side were punished for not making the most of their dominance against Hertha. In the end, the hosts needed a Robert Lewandowski penalty to earn a point after Hertha scored two quickfire goals at the end of the first half. \u201cHertha were a bit lucky to share the spoils, but they defended well,\u201d Kovac said. \u201cWe had a lot of chances, we failed to take many clear-cut chances. But I can\u2019t blame my team. They tried everything, they gave it everything. It was one-way traffic, we were dominant. But we lacked the bit of luck you need. A compliment to Hertha for bearing up against it. We must make sure we soon collect the two points we failed to take today.\u201d Hertha boss Ante Covic, in his first Bundesliga match as a head coach, said: \u201cWhen you play away to Munich you know from the start you can\u2019t dominate the match as you\u2019d like to. You must still believe you can have some good moments to take something away from here.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "There are a few reasons government MPs give to explain why Scott Morrison will not increase Newstart, the inadequate $277.85-a-week base rate of Australia\u2019s unemployment payment. Most of them have been debunked. Despite all the spin about \u201csupplementary payments\u201d, for example, there are more than 300,000 Australians forced to survive on $40 a day, before rent, utilities and food. And those who get extra money don\u2019t get much, particularly those without children. \u201cNo one has ever said it would be easy to live without a job\u201d is how the social services minister, Anne Ruston, has put it. Morrison\u2019s response is a mantra \u2013 \u201cthe best form of welfare is a job\u201d \u2013 that does not really engage with the core question: How does he imagine people on Newstart actually live on $40 a day? What does life on Newstart actually look like? Lisa Carberry, 48 Weekly income: $343.70 Newstart: $277.85 a week Energy supplement: $4.40 a week Rent assistance: $65.85 a week Pharmaceutical allowance: $6.20 a week Regular expenses: $304.20 Rent: $149 a week Car repayments: $136.15 a week (paid monthly) Phone: $11.55 a week (paid monthly) Robodebt: $7.50 a week Left with before food, utilities: $5.60 a day It\u2019s two days after Lisa Carberry\u2019s fortnightly Newstart payments went into her bank account and she is already down to her last $10. \u201cI now have $9.95 to last me for the next two weeks,\u201d she says over the phone from her home in Geelong. Carberry has been on Newstart for about three years \u2013 the average period of time a person can expect to spend on the payment, according to the government\u2019s own data. Every month, her bank balance takes a big hit when her car repayments are due. To tide her over, she will get some food and fuel vouchers from the local Vinnies. This week, she will also tell her community housing provider the rent will be late. \u201cI have to either not pay a bill or access charities for food and things in order to continue to tread water,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s really what it is. It\u2019s treading water. It\u2019s not swimming.\u201d The car means a lot to her. Carberry bought her Kia Optima a few years ago when she was still employed. That was before the place she worked at went bust and her mum got sick. Things got tough from there. She moved in with her mother and received a carer\u2019s pension of about $900 a fortnight. When her mother died in 2015, she was put on Newstart. She struggled with the rent and was soon served with a \u201cno grounds\u201d eviction. Despite some stints in casual work, Carberry has been on the dole ever since. By the end of 2016, she was living in her car. She is desperate to hang on to it now. She says: \u201cBecause it was under finance, I would not have actually ended up with any money for myself to get another vehicle or to do anything with. Whatever the car was sold for, that would have all gone to the finance company with the chance that I would have still owed them money.\u201d Carberry has a teaching degree and has worked as a security guard. She is a strong advocate for herself and others on Newstart. Once, after Carberry\u2019s mother had died and she had fallen behind on her payments, the car was repossessed. It was returned after she complained to the ombudsman. In February, Carberry got a roof over her head through a community housing provider. Her rent is about $150 a week. Normally, Carberry would have a bit more money than $10 to get her through the fortnight. But this week, she went to Bunnings after her weekly grocery shop and bought the cheapest Venetian blinds she could find for $23. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to do it for ages to give myself light in my unit and some privacy,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I can have my blinds up and not have everybody see in. \u201cBut I\u2019ve financially suffered for doing that. That has taken months for me to do. I\u2019ve been in here since February.\u201d Centrelink also deducts $15 a fortnight from her Newstart payments for a Robodebt from 2012. Carberry says she intends to challenge it. Like about 30% of people on Newstart, she gets rental assistance, but it doesn\u2019t get close to covering her rent. Right now, she is battling an illness \u2013 and has been exempted from looking for work since April. She will have surgery soon. Carberry laughs when she is asked about the last time she treated herself. She nominates the new blinds. There was also some chocolate she got in a hamper brought by Vinnies. \u201cI can\u2019t go to Starbucks or Gloria Jean\u2019s and just say, \u2018Can I have a latte, please?\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cAlthough I\u2019ve got the health issues, I want to keep my fitness up after my operation. \u201cI can\u2019t even look at going to the local council pool for a swim.\u201d There are also her two pets: a dog called Toohey and Phoenix, her cat. She puts a conservative estimate of her actual expenditure on food for the three of them at $60 a week. When she was living in her car, people sometimes asked why she kept her pets. \u201cAnd my response to that kind of comment was \u2026 \u2018Well, these are my children, these are my family. And I am not giving them up,\u2019\u201d she says. Peter Cooney, 58 Weekly income: $282.25 Newstart: $277.85 Energy supplement: $4.40 Regular expenses: $213.41 a week Rent: $120 a week Storage unit: $41.50 a week (paid monthly) Welfare debts: $32.50 a week Court fines: $12.50 a week Phone: $6.90 a week (paid monthly) Left with before food: $9.85 a day Like Lisa Carberry, Peter Cooney\u2019s route onto Newstart began with a good deed. His mother was sick and could not look after herself. So he quit his job and moved in with her. His sister joined them shortly after. Within 10 months of each other, they had both died. Of a brain haemorrhage and a heart attack. \u201cThey left me with a house that I could no longer afford to rent,\u201d Cooney says. \u201cEventually I got kicked out of there and I had nowhere to put the furniture.\u201d Cooney has been unemployed for about a year and is as good as homeless. Because he had nowhere to go, an ex-partner lets him stay at her place in the suburbs of Perth. He pays about $120 \u2013 cheaper than anything he could get in the private market. But it\u2019s a turbulent situation. \u201cThings haven\u2019t been all that rosy there, so quite a few times I\u2019ll just go sleep in the car,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a place down in Ocean Reef where the powers that be turn a blind eye.\u201d Cooney has worked in furniture removal, once managed a hotel in Cairns and, before he quit to care for his mum, he was a brick paver. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a young man\u2019s game,\u201d he says. \u201cI rang a paver a while back and he asked how old I was. I said, \u201858\u2019. And he said, \u2018You\u2019re joking?\u2019 And that was the end of that.\u201d Automatic deductions from his Newstart include two welfare debts and some outstanding fines. So he has only $237.47 coming in each week. \u201cI haven\u2019t been surviving \u2013 I\u2019ve sort of been leaning on other people,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit demeaning. You lose a bit of self-respect.\u201d Cooney is a smoker, pays $30 a month for his phone, and there are also his belongings, which are kept in a storage locker for $180 a month. He would be happy to ditch the furniture, but he could not stand to give up his books. \u201cReading is about the only hobby I\u2019ve got, really,\u201d he says. His only other treat is the occasional beer from Aldi. \u201cI\u2019ll often just eat once a day,\u201d he says. \u201cI eat a lot of instant noodles, with eggs and some frozen vegies in it. Or a chicken, maybe.\u201d The diet is a problem because his doctor has already warned him about his arteries: \u201cMy father died actually four years older than I am now from a heart attack.\u201d Recently, his doctor also referred him to a psychiatrist. He thinks he might have ADD. \u201cHe gave me two to see \u2013 one was $200 and one was $300 for a visit.\u201d He couldn\u2019t go. Cooney\u2019s priority is finding a place to live. \u201cIf I could get enough just to like rent a tiny little place, a room or even one of those portable things that some of the van parks have or something, but you know, you can\u2019t get something for $150,\u201d he says. \u201cEven in share houses now, people are asking for $150 for a room.\u201d What does he think about Morrison\u2019s line: \u201cThe best form of welfare is a job\u201d? \u201cWell, I\u2019m quite happy, if they can find me a job, I\u2019d rather be working,\u201d he says. \u201cBut unfortunately, with my qualifications and my age, it\u2019s not so easy.\u201d Aeryn Brown, 35 Weekly income: $285.35 Newstart: $277.85 Energy supplement: $4.40 Pharmaceutical allowance: $3.10 Regular expenses: $122.65 a week Rent: $69.45 (deducted from Newstart) Electricity: $10 (deducted from Newstart) Internet: $15.90 a week (paid monthly) Phone: $6.90 a week (paid monthly) Netflix: $2.30 a week (paid monthly) Home and contents insurance: $8.10 a week (paid monthly) Opal card: $10 a week Left with before food: $23.24 a day By December, Aeryn Brown will have been on Newstart for two years. Before that, she was studying \u2013 she has a bachelor of arts/communication from the University of Technology Sydney and a diploma. All up, she\u2019s \u201cbeen with Centrelink for eight years\u201d. \u201cYou just barely survive on this,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not living, it\u2019s surviving.\u201d At the end of the fortnight, Brown is not left with much. But she is in public housing near Wollongong and considers herself lucky in that respect. \u201cSometimes I will be down to $20,\u201d Brown says. \u201cIf I have no money, I just stay home and eat what I\u2019ve got in the kitchen, really.\u201d She watches her bank account \u201clike a hawk\u201d, and when she reels off an itemised list of her spending, it\u2019s obvious she means it. Internet $69 a month (Brown is looking for a new plan). $10 a week for her Opal card. $30 a month for her phone. $10 on Netflix. Groceries $60 a week. Brown buys home-brand products, except for pasta sauce because the \u201chome-brand stuff all has onions in it\u201d, which she doesn\u2019t eat. At home, she cooks on Monday and will eat the same food for four days in a row. Chocolate milk is an occasional treat. Brown\u2019s last holiday was five years ago for a weekend in Perth. She goes to the movies once or twice a year. She is studying a certificate three in community services. She\u2019ll take a Cup-a-Soup and a mug for lunch. \u201cI can get boiling water at class.\u201d When larger expenses come up, it\u2019s a problem. The last time she needed new glasses, Brown had to ask her parents to pay the $200 gap. (They also pay her private health insurance.) \u201cAnything beyond $200 and I\u2019d be screwed,\u201d she says. Brown has anxiety and depression and so she has now been spared what she calls the \u201cabsolutely terrible\u201d Jobactive program. Instead, she is on the disability employment services program and is only required to look for four jobs a month. She is desperate to work. \u201cIt makes me so angry,\u201d she says. \u201cI just want somebody to give me a go.\u201d Under her mental health plan, she gets 10 free sessions a year with a psychologist. \u201cThat\u2019s bugger-all. I\u2019ll use those up and less than six months,\u201d she says. \u201cOnce they\u2019ve gone, they\u2019re gone. I can\u2019t get any more for a year, and I can\u2019t afford to pay.\u201d If Newstart was increased, she could also buy better food and put more money on her Opal card. Even now, her job search is restricted to places that are close to public transport. She can\u2019t afford to buy a car and she can\u2019t afford lessons to get her licence, anyway. \u201cI could actually buy stuff because I want them, not because I need them,\u201d she says. \u201cLike I could buy new clothes because I want them, not because my clothes are wearing out, and I can\u2019t just keep mending them. \u201cBasically, if my shirts start to fray, I mend it, I sew the hem back up.

The organisation\u2019s public funding \u2013 for measures to reduce pollution flowing to the Great Barrier Reef \u2013 has been called into question after the group began promoting lectures by the controversial academic Peter Ridd, who argues farm run-off is not damaging the reef. The overwhelming scientific consensus, supported by governments and the foundation, is that water quality is one of the most significant threats to the health of the natural wonder. In April, the foundation awarded $1.4m to Canegrowers \u2013 one of the first grants issued under its $443m partnership with the federal government \u2013 to continue a program managed by external behavioural consultants called Cane Changer. Cane Changer is partly designed \u201cto improve recognition\u201d of growers \u201cfor their long history of environmental stewardship\u201d and the organisation has said the program will \u201cset the record straight\u201d. It also works with farmers to promote voluntary \u201cbest management practice\u201d measures. The Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson has this week written to the foundation to question the award of the grant.

But the nurses didn\u2019t have a clue. They\u2019d never heard of it.\u201d Hayes and her husband, both registered nurses, had not heard of it either, adding to the shock.</p> <p>Hayes\u2019s mother cared for Alex while she recovered, which led to a strong bond forming between them. </p> <p>For Hayes, this brings conflicting emotions: \u201cI\u2019m so grateful for her support.

Jenny Hallam, senior lecturer in psychology at the University of Derby, says: \u201cResearch suggests adults who had secure attachments as children go on to have healthier relationships and better self worth.

Victoria has six units but New South Wales has none.</p> <p>Anne Buist, professor of perinatal psychiatry at the University of Melbourne, has run one of those six mother and baby units for 30 years. \u201cIf separated, the baby will attach to the primary caregiver,\u201d she says. \u201cThat can be difficult for mum from a psychological point of view, if the baby is preferring grandma. The sooner we can get mum well for that essential year of mother/baby bonding, the better.\u201d </p> <p>Buist points out that disorganised attachment can occur and lead to behavioural problems later if the mother\u2019s health isn\u2019t prioritised along with the child\u2019s.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to start asking how the mum is doing. Not just the child,\u201d she adds.</p> <p>For Nyna Giles\u2019s mother, that question came too late.</p> <p>Before Giles was born, Carolyn Scott was a model, socialising in high society \u2013 she was Grace Kelly\u2019s bridesmaid. But after giving birth to Nyna, things were never the same.</p> <p>Scott became detached from reality. She removed Giles from school and isolated herself, ashamed of the symptoms of her illness, which she hid to the friends who occasionally called in. Later in life, she deteriorated so far, she became homeless.</p> <p>Giles admits she used to feel \u201cashamed\u201d of her mother but that embarrassment has given way to pride: \u201cI feel compassion now. I firmly believe that year after I was born, if she\u2019d been treated then, she could\u2019ve recovered. Really my birth was the fork in the road \u2013 a path she went down and never recovered from.\u201d</p> <p>That path also became the end of the road for Iain Cunningham\u2019s mother, Irene. Now 43, up until very recently all Iain knew about his mother was that she died when he was three, and had been in a coma.</p> <p>Making the recent film<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/02/irenes-ghost-review-iain-cunningham-documentary\"> Irene\u2019s Ghost</a> to piece together a jigsaw created by stigma and silence, Cunningham discovered his mother had died in a psychiatric hospital where she had been sedated the night before for being \u201cnoisy and manic\u201d \u2013 a sea-change from the quiet Irene all her friends knew. The cardiac arrest she died from \u2013 aged 28, with no family history of heart disease \u2013 was probably related to the high doses of antipsychotics she was on, and the extreme anxiety she was experiencing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"08be0f10deac633acb75b5bcfcc35872b5e2bb68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08be0f10deac633acb75b5bcfcc35872b5e2bb68/0_465_2065_1238/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Irene with Iain Cunningham in his pushchair\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Irene with Iain Cunningham, who made a film about her illness, Irene\u2019s Ghost.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Through the film, Cunningham learns that his father\u2019s vicarious trauma and distress over the shocking change in Irene was the reason her postpartum psychosis was never even verbalised until recently: \u201cA series of euphemisms were used which avoid the bare facts of mental ill-health. A coma, trouble with her nerves, even depression or baby blues are sometimes used to play down the severity of something which is in fact an extreme psychiatric and medical emergency,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The film\u2019s title comes from Irene\u2019s own words upon giving birth to Cunningham: \u201cI\u2019m not Irene you know. I\u2019m her ghost.\u201d She developed symptoms of talking incessantly, not sleeping, hallucinating about rats and spiders, and believing her newborn son was God, that his head was expanding and that he was growing teeth. She would write nonsensical notes on paper and the walls. This was followed by periods of catatonia, mania, anxiety and deep depression. </p> <p>Cunningham now does some work with the UK charity Action on Postpartum Psychosis. He describes how far the stigma spreads: \u201cEven people working or volunteering for that charity often haven\u2019t spoken to their children about the psychosis they had when they were born. They want to, but don\u2019t know how to start it.\u201d Its CEO, Dr Jesica Heron, says: \u201cThe secrecy and shame that has surrounded postpartum psychosis for many years, can damage families and relationships \u2013 and that open discussion at the right time, in the right way, can help to build relationships and understanding.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"616dbfb21a3d07e9b7c1e5a2771f62ee0d9e2a20\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/616dbfb21a3d07e9b7c1e5a2771f62ee0d9e2a20/0_242_1973_2464/801.jpg\" alt=\"A poster for the movie Irene\u2019s Ghost\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A poster for the movie Irene\u2019s Ghost.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s a silver lining in this story. In the film, Cunningham\u2019s childhood neighbours, who stepped in to help, say he was \u201cruined\u201d \u2013 a midlands colloquialism meaning spoilt. Like Hayes\u2019 son Alex, his mother\u2019s illness ultimately meant he was surrounded with more protective love, not less. Dr Heron says there are some studies suggesting that the children of mothers with postpartum psychosis might even perform better than others on measures of things such as expressive language.</p> <p>The tragedy of the disorder can make families incredibly close knit. The first time Californian woman Angela Burling, 63, went through it with her daughter Allyson in 1979, everyone was stumped. The former nurse went from soft-spoken and even-keeled to singing at the top of her lungs, turning on every tap in in the house, and having delusions that she was the bride of Christ, her husband was Christ himself and her daughter was the messenger of truth.</p> <p>Ten days straight of zero sleep led to the psychosis. She tried to jump off a bridge to \u201csave\u201d her husband Geoff in the belief he\u2019d follow her and be baptised. </p> <p>Medical professionals thought it was a bout of schizophrenia, but when she became pregnant again, a midwife falsely told her it was unlikely to recur. \u201cThat advice changed my life,\u201d she says. \u201cIt prevented me receiving the treatment that exists to prevent a recurrence.\u201d</p> <p>Upon giving birth to her second son, Michael, in 1982, Burling remembers everything being \u201crosy and fine\u201d for nine months until one Monday, when the delusions suddenly returned. By Thursday, she was being charged with murder.</p> <p>The same delusions had returned \u2013 that Geoff was Christ and she Christ\u2019s wife. On Thursday morning, the delusions convinced her that her baby was the devil. \u201cI even saw his face contort into the devil,\u201d she says. Alone, terrified and experiencing psychosis, she begged God to tell her what to do. And then, \u201calmost mechanically,\u201d she drowned him in a bath.</p> <p>Detectives wanted Burling tried for murder but her husband mentioned what happened when she had Allyson and instead she was put in a psychiatric ward. \u201cThings got worse there,\u201d she says. \u201cI went catatonic and, as reality set in and I came down from my manic delusional state. I was left with unimaginable grief and repercussions that have stayed with me my whole life.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c3fa939c015ede1ab8fee37bbbe93771686df3a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3fa939c015ede1ab8fee37bbbe93771686df3a0/0_77_1464_878/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Angela Burling, who \u2018almost mechanically\u2019 drowned her second son in the bath, with her daughter Allyson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Angela Burling, who \u2018almost mechanically\u2019 drowned her second son in the bath, with her daughter Allyson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was only then that a psychiatrist, an expert in women\u2019s health sent by her defence attorney, diagnosed her with postpartum psychosis. \u201cAmid all the heartbreak, it was almost a relief,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have an explanation, a definable illness.\u201d</p> <p>Infanticide like this is extremely rare among postpartum psychosis patients, says Dr Magdalena Romanowicz, a child psychiatrist at Mayo Clinic. \u201cThe biggest worry is suicide,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s the leading cause of death of women with the disorder.\u201d</p> <p>Burling was released, given the treatment she had long needed and was found innocent of any crime. Four years later, after connecting with experts on the disorder to prevent a relapse, she received some news: she was pregnant again. \u201cI was thrilled\u201d she says. \u201cI had another chance to prove I\u2019m a great mum. Because I am a great mum.\u201d</p> <p>The moment Tommy came through the birth canal, Burling describes a veil of grief lifting: \u201cI\u2019d been grieving so deeply, couldn\u2019t feel happiness or joy in my heart.

He gave me my life back,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Her daughter Allyson, 39, says she, Tommy, 32, and their mum are now extremely close, describing her as a \u201cfantastic mum\u201d.</p> <p>Burling feels like one of the lucky ones. She now uses her position on the board of Postpartum Support International to break down the taboo: \u201cI was able to get therapy and treatment to heal me. I\u2019ve been able to get my master\u2019s, swim, hike, bike, re-marry, be a mum to my kids,\u201d she says. \u201cSo many women didn\u2019t get these opportunities \u2013 the stigma often meant they didn\u2019t seek or receive treatment.\u201d</p> <p>Now that Allyson has a two-year old son, she has a new understanding of her mother\u2019s disorder: \u201cI always had admiration for her to have experienced that horror and the strength she has needed to get through that.\u201d </p> <p>She pauses to compose herself through tears, then says: \u201cShe\u2019s the most courageous woman I know.\u201d</p> <p><em>Action on Postpartum Psychosis is working on a guide about \u201cBeing a parent after postpartum psychosis\u201d, available later this year. <a href=\"http://www.app-network.org/\">www.app-network.org</a>.

She was admitted into the general psychiatric ward, and her baby was removed from her. It was one of the scariest weeks of her life. \u201cI thought the staff were trying to kill me. The first night, I thought I\u2019d died.\u201d Hayes was suffering from a severe psychiatric disorder called postpartum psychosis. It affects one in 600 mothers and is slightly more common with the first born. Fifty per cent of mothers experiencing it will have no history of mental ill-health. Experts are divided about what causes it. Patients experience manic episodes that cause hallucinations and delusions extremely detached from reality. Delusions of divine superpowers are common. Once reality sets back in, a deep depression often follows. Today, a ripple of understanding has emerged following a storyline on British soap opera EastEnders that features Stacey Branning and, recently, singer Adele revealing her best friend had it. But very little is known about the grown-up children of postpartum psychosis mothers and those women who, through their disorder, were either physically or emotionally absent during what experts say is the most crucial bonding time in the child\u2019s life. This, combined with the taboo of the disorder, has often left women now aged over 50 to deal alone with lifelong feelings of guilt and shame. Some will go on to develop bipolar disorder. Terri Smith, the chief executive of Perinatal Anxiety and Depression Australia (Panda), says: \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing there\u2019s still little known about postpartum psychosis. It\u2019s such a dangerous illness and, if untreated, the risks are great.\u201d Smith\u2019s charity runs a helpline often called by \u201cdistressed dads, not knowing what\u2019s going on or how to cope\u201d. Treatment includes antipsychotic medication, therapy, and, in rare cases, electroconvulsive therapy. Even less was known 24 years ago when Hayes was alone, trembling and paranoid, without her newborn. \u201cI just needed somebody to say you\u2019ve got a postnatal illness, you will recover. But the nurses didn\u2019t have a clue. They\u2019d never heard of it.\u201d Hayes and her husband, both registered nurses, had not heard of it either, adding to the shock. Hayes\u2019s mother cared for Alex while she recovered, which led to a strong bond forming between them. For Hayes, this brings conflicting emotions: \u201cI\u2019m so grateful for her support. But I found it difficult. Because I wasn\u2019t around in those early days, I think mum sees Alex as her child sometimes.\u201d Some of this comes down to classic attachment theory. Jenny Hallam, senior lecturer in psychology at the University of Derby, says: \u201cResearch suggests adults who had secure attachments as children go on to have healthier relationships and better self worth. This piles pressure on women to maintain a close relationship with their child.\u201d Experts stress the importance of mother and baby units in hospitals, so they aren\u2019t separated during treatment. Australia is considered a world leader in this area, says Smith, but, even there, treatment can be a postcode lottery. Victoria has six units but New South Wales has none. Anne Buist, professor of perinatal psychiatry at the University of Melbourne, has run one of those six mother and baby units for 30 years. \u201cIf separated, the baby will attach to the primary caregiver,\u201d she says. \u201cThat can be difficult for mum from a psychological point of view, if the baby is preferring grandma.

Not just the child,\u201d she adds. For Nyna Giles\u2019s mother, that question came too late. Before Giles was born, Carolyn Scott was a model, socialising in high society \u2013 she was Grace Kelly\u2019s bridesmaid. But after giving birth to Nyna, things were never the same. Scott became detached from reality. She removed Giles from school and isolated herself, ashamed of the symptoms of her illness, which she hid to the friends who occasionally called in. Later in life, she deteriorated so far, she became homeless. Giles admits she used to feel \u201cashamed\u201d of her mother but that embarrassment has given way to pride: \u201cI feel compassion now. I firmly believe that year after I was born, if she\u2019d been treated then, she could\u2019ve recovered. Really my birth was the fork in the road \u2013 a path she went down and never recovered from.\u201d That path also became the end of the road for Iain Cunningham\u2019s mother, Irene. Now 43, up until very recently all Iain knew about his mother was that she died when he was three, and had been in a coma. Making the recent film Irene\u2019s Ghost to piece together a jigsaw created by stigma and silence, Cunningham discovered his mother had died in a psychiatric hospital where she had been sedated the night before for being \u201cnoisy and manic\u201d \u2013 a sea-change from the quiet Irene all her friends knew. The cardiac arrest she died from \u2013 aged 28, with no family history of heart disease \u2013 was probably related to the high doses of antipsychotics she was on, and the extreme anxiety she was experiencing. Through the film, Cunningham learns that his father\u2019s vicarious trauma and distress over the shocking change in Irene was the reason her postpartum psychosis was never even verbalised until recently: \u201cA series of euphemisms were used which avoid the bare facts of mental ill-health. A coma, trouble with her nerves, even depression or baby blues are sometimes used to play down the severity of something which is in fact an extreme psychiatric and medical emergency,\u201d he says. The film\u2019s title comes from Irene\u2019s own words upon giving birth to Cunningham: \u201cI\u2019m not Irene you know.

Like Hayes\u2019 son Alex, his mother\u2019s illness ultimately meant he was surrounded with more protective love, not less. Dr Heron says there are some studies suggesting that the children of mothers with postpartum psychosis might even perform better than others on measures of things such as expressive language. The tragedy of the disorder can make families incredibly close knit. The first time Californian woman Angela Burling, 63, went through it with her daughter Allyson in 1979, everyone was stumped. The former nurse went from soft-spoken and even-keeled to singing at the top of her lungs, turning on every tap in in the house, and having delusions that she was the bride of Christ, her husband was Christ himself and her daughter was the messenger of truth.

Medical professionals thought it was a bout of schizophrenia, but when she became pregnant again, a midwife falsely told her it was unlikely to recur. \u201cThat advice changed my life,\u201d she says. \u201cIt prevented me receiving the treatment that exists to prevent a recurrence.\u201d Upon giving birth to her second son, Michael, in 1982, Burling remembers everything being \u201crosy and fine\u201d for nine months until one Monday, when the delusions suddenly returned. By Thursday, she was being charged with murder. The same delusions had returned \u2013 that Geoff was Christ and she Christ\u2019s wife. On Thursday morning, the delusions convinced her that her baby was the devil. \u201cI even saw his face contort into the devil,\u201d she says. Alone, terrified and experiencing psychosis, she begged God to tell her what to do. And then, \u201calmost mechanically,\u201d she drowned him in a bath. Detectives wanted Burling tried for murder but her husband mentioned what happened when she had Allyson and instead she was put in a psychiatric ward. \u201cThings got worse there,\u201d she says. \u201cI went catatonic and, as reality set in and I came down from my manic delusional state. I was left with unimaginable grief and repercussions that have stayed with me my whole life.\u201d It was only then that a psychiatrist, an expert in women\u2019s health sent by her defence attorney, diagnosed her with postpartum psychosis. \u201cAmid all the heartbreak, it was almost a relief,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have an explanation, a definable illness.\u201d Infanticide like this is extremely rare among postpartum psychosis patients, says Dr Magdalena Romanowicz, a child psychiatrist at Mayo Clinic. \u201cThe biggest worry is suicide,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s the leading cause of death of women with the disorder.\u201d Burling was released, given the treatment she had long needed and was found innocent of any crime. Four years later, after connecting with experts on the disorder to prevent a relapse, she received some news: she was pregnant again. \u201cI was thrilled\u201d she says. \u201cI had another chance to prove I\u2019m a great mum. Because I am a great mum.\u201d The moment Tommy came through the birth canal, Burling describes a veil of grief lifting: \u201cI\u2019d been grieving so deeply, couldn\u2019t feel happiness or joy in my heart. He removed that burden, completed my joy and freed my spirit. He gave me my life back,\u201d she says. Her daughter Allyson, 39, says she, Tommy, 32, and their mum are now extremely close, describing her as a \u201cfantastic mum\u201d. Burling feels like one of the lucky ones. She now uses her position on the board of Postpartum Support International to break down the taboo: \u201cI was able to get therapy and treatment to heal me. I\u2019ve been able to get my master\u2019s, swim, hike, bike, re-marry, be a mum to my kids,\u201d she says. \u201cSo many women didn\u2019t get these opportunities \u2013 the stigma often meant they didn\u2019t seek or receive treatment.\u201d Now that Allyson has a two-year old son, she has a new understanding of her mother\u2019s disorder: \u201cI always had admiration for her to have experienced that horror and the strength she has needed to get through that.\u201d She pauses to compose herself through tears, then says: \u201cShe\u2019s the most courageous woman I know.\u201d Action on Postpartum Psychosis is working on a guide about \u201cBeing a parent after postpartum psychosis\u201d, available later this year. www.app-network.org.

      "bodyText": "TV programs and tightening credit are prompting more Australians to renovate their homes while evidence mounts that kitchen upgrades can have deadly consequences for tradesmen. Silica from stone benchtops is responsible for serious and sometimes fatal health problems for the workers who cut and install these products. Here\u2019s what you need to know if you\u2019re thinking about adding one to your home. What\u2019s the problem with silica? Crystalline silica has been implicated in the deaths of numerous stonemasons who have worked on benchtops. The law firm Slater and Gordon announced in March it was in the early stages of mounting a national class action against manufacturers, as authorities brace for a health crisis that could be worse than asbestos. Silica is found in stone, rock, sand, gravel, clay, bricks, tiles and concrete, and in artificial stone, natural stone and some plastic benchtops. Silica dust is 100 times smaller than a grain of sand, and exposure can lead to lung cancer, silicosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and kidney disease. WorkCover Queensland has accepted 164 worker compensation claims for silicosis from stonemasons in the benchtop industry. WorkSafe Victoria received 28 claims for silica-related conditions in 2018, and 15 workers have died from the disease since 1985. SafeWork NSW has had 12 silicosis claims. Tasmania has had five cases. In 2011, about 587,000 Australians were exposed to silica dust at work and an estimated 5,758 will develop lung cancer over the course of their lives, according to the Cancer Council. What should customers ask prospective kitchen suppliers? Paul Sutton, the Victorian Trades Hall Council occupational health and safety expert, urged consumers to be proactive in asking kitchen benchtop suppliers about their safety measures for stonemasons. Suppliers should be managing the silica dust with local exhaust ventilation, water suppression and dust collection attachments, and ensuring workers have appropriate personal protective equipment including respiratory masks. Sutton said techniques involving wet cutting were preferable to dry cutting. All states and territories other than the ACT have banned uncontrolled dry cutting, in which the dust is not controlled by water or extraction. Canberra designer Stephen Collins said his family was conscious of the occupational health and safety issue when they started researching kitchen designs, having read about silicosis cases in the media. \u201cIt\u2019s all very nice to have a granite benchtop \u2026 but if someone is potentially going to die in 20 years because of your granite benchtop, then that\u2019s not a good reason to have one,\u201d Collins told Guardian Australia. Collins toured the Granite Transformations factory in Goulburn to satisfy himself that the company was looking after workers\u2019 safety. He said the tradies who installed the family\u2019s benchtops were \u201ccompletely paranoid about safety\u201d. \u201cEveryone on the site on the day was wearing a face mask, not just a surgical mask, but a mask with breather [valves].\u201d He said the tradie cutting the stone benchtop in his garage was wearing a Hazmat suit, and an industrial-strength extraction fan was in action. Which materials are safer? \u201cOne thing consumers could do is ensure they order natural stone, not artificial ones [because of the lower silica content],\u201d Sutton told Guardian Australia. \u201cThat\u2019s a massive difference to the worker in terms of exposure levels.\u201d Artificial stone benchtops can contain more than 90% silica, whereas natural stones such as granite contain between 25% and 40%. However, natural stone benchtops tend to be a bit more expensive compared to engineered stone benchtops. Engineered stone benchtops range from $400 to $600 a square metre, excluding installation. Marble is a more expensive option \u2013 $800 for a square metre but up to $3000 after installation. Granite can range from $700 to $1,700 per square metre, including installation. What are authorities doing about silicosis? Safe Work Australia, the national body that develops work health and safety policies, has decided to cut the silica dust exposure limit from 0.1 milligrams per cubic metre over an eight-hour shift to 0.05 milligrams. But the new limit won\u2019t come in for three years and has to be ratified by state and territory governments. The Cancer Council of Australia, unions and Victorian government wanted the limit to be set at 0.02 milligrams per cubic metre, which would make the nation a world leader. But business groups had been arguing for the status quo. Victorian Michael Nolan, 33, was diagnosed with silicosis in March after cutting stone benchtops for a decade, and has a life expectancy of only five to 10 years if he does not get a lung transplant soon. \u201cWhat they really need to look at is banning the products at 98% silica and having some sort of limit [on silica content],\u201d Nolan said. \u201cWe may as well be making benchtops out of asbestos.\u201d The engineered stone is manufactured in countries such as Italy and Israel. Raw stone slabs are imported into Australia, where workers cut, grind and polish the stone. Documents obtained by the Guardian show the federal health minister, Greg Hunt, last year requested that Safe Work Australia consider putting in place \u201cimportation controls on engineered stone products\u201d. Hunt wrote he was \u201cextremely troubled by the recent surge in cases of silicosis\u201d. The government\u2019s new $5m national dust diseases task force began work this month on a prevention, early identification, control and management plan. It is working on getting a national dust disease register up and running by the end of the year. Jonathan Walsh, the principal lawyer for dust diseases at the Maurice Blackburn law firm, said there\u2019s merit in considering an importation ban similar to asbestos. \u201cI think the market forces are going to be innovative and products will be created in order to replace those silica-based products that are coming in,\u201d Walsh said. How is the industry reacting? The Australian Stone Advisory Association, an industry group which covers 70% of manufacturers, insists that calls for import controls and moratoriums on engineered stone are unnecessary and the focus should be on safe work practices. \u201cSilicosis is preventable \u2013 what we are seeing now is the re-emergence of an old disease reflecting inadequate work health and safety practices with a comparatively new material,\u201d the association said. \u201cWork practices that allow the safe use of engineered stone include wet cutting, the use of local exhaust ventilation, on-tool extraction and respirators to ensure the protection of worker health.\u201d Stone benchtop manufacturers are keen to emphasise their products are completely safe once installed.",

Alarmed by the Premier League takeover of Europe\u2019s major competitions last season, Spain\u2019s top clubs have spent and spent big. Atl\u00e9tico have splashed \u20ac256m to revamp an ageing team while Real Madrid\u2019s total is closer to \u20ac300m. Frenkie de Jong and Antoine Griezmann lead the incomings at Barcelona and the battle to secure Neymar\u2019s signature is still raging. </p> <p>Barcelona are the champions and remain the team to beat but a trip to Athletic Bilbao is a tough way to start, especially without Lionel Messi. The Argentinian was injured in the Copa Am\u00e9rica and Ernesto Valverde has decided not to rush him back for the season\u2019s opener. How will Bar\u00e7a cope? Is Demb\u00e9le ready to step up? Will Griezmann slot in seamlessly after his controversial move from Atl\u00e9tico? Or can Athletic give the chasing pack an early shot in the arm? It\u2019s the Basques v the Catalans to see who will draw first blood in Spain\u2019s top division.</p> <p><strong>Kick-off is 8pm BST.</strong></p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "The match report is in so I\u2019ll say goodbye. Aritz Aduriz was on the pitch for a total of three minutes. He had two touches and one shot, and with it produced the goal of a lifetime. What a hero. Goodnight and thanks for joining. It\u2019s been a pleasure. I\u2019ll leave you with this \u2026 What now for Barcelona? Messi is still injured. Suarez is likely to be joining him on the sidelines. Coutinho is going on loan to Bayern. Griezmann started very slowly. And Dembele still flatters to deceive. De Jong looked good and his revolving midfield partnership with Rakitic in the second half showed real sigs of promise. But Real Madrid and Atletico will be licking their lips now. Some interesting facts about Aduriz and his goal \u2026 Pictures of Aduriz\u2019s stunning volley have been painfully slow to emerge, but I have unearthed an image from Euro 2016 to give you an idea of his body shape. The result was not the same, but the execution similar \u2026 There\u2019ll be partying tonight in Basque country \u2026 Simon McMahon didn\u2019t think this would happen, no one did. \u201cEvening Rob,\u201d he wrote midway through the second half. \u201cAll things considered, I think Athletic Bilbao will probably be happy with a point. We can\u2019t all be like Dundee United and beat the Catalans every time we play now, can we?\u201d Back to San Mames and the place is rocking. It wasn\u2019t the greatest game and Barcelona looked the most likely winners but only one side had their brilliant talisman to call on. Lionel Messi could not have produced anything better than the sublime scissor-kick Aritz Aduriz unleashed after launching his 38-year-old frame high into the air in the 88th minute. The first goal of the season in La Liga might just turn out to be the best. The champions start with a defeat. The hero of Bilbao has cemented his legend for ever more. Let me know your thoughts. Bayern have also stuttered on day one in the Bundesliga. Can Coutinho save them? Andy Lynam has an update via email. \u201cDespite Lewandowski\u2019s VAR-assisted pen on 60 to save the game for Bayern, their inability to get the winner will give much succour to BVB and Leipzig,\u201d he reports. \u201cThey should have had the game sewn up midway through the first half but Hertha\u2019s double-strike before half-time really rattled them. Bayern dominated and are clearly stuffed with talent, but the game showed that their confidence is surprisingly fragile. Let\u2019s see what Coutinho can add.\u201d I\u2019m already looking forward to Sid\u2019s column on Monday \u2026 Sid Lowe wrote this on Aritz Aduriz in 2016. He shows no sign of letting up. That was an incredible finish to the game and provides a wonderful start to the season. This will be Aduriz\u2019s final season. He is 38 years old and a legend at this club. But never can he have scored a better goal than that. Shades of Rooney\u2019s legendary strike against City. Athletic shock the champions on the opening day. 92 min: Barca probe, Alba centres and Athletic clear. 91 min: There will be three minutes of added time. Capa is played into space down the right. The ball is bouncing but he caresses it first time into the centre. Aduriz, on the pitch for less than a minute, rises and unleashes a sensational bicycle kick. The ball arrows past Ter Stegen in a flash. What a goal. Simply stunning. That is a stunning overhead kick winner. 87 min: De Jong snuffs out the danger coolly when Capa escapes briefly down the right. Aduriz comes on for Williams. The crowd roar the veteran\u2019s introduction. Can be be the difference maker? 85 min: The De Jong-Rakitic axis is working smoothly, maybe a sign of things to come over the season. But the cutting edge is lacking. 84 min: The Dembele-Alba combination releases the flying left-back into space. He pulls the ball back but Griezmann\u2019s shot is blocked. The corner is recycled to Rafinha to cross but Griezmann\u2019s tame header floats over. Here is the full story on Coutinho to Bayern. Might they reconsider after this \u2026 80 min: Rafinha dribbles inside the box, waltzes past a couple of defenders and unleashes a shot but still Barcelona cannot breach the home defence. 78 min: Barcelona are half the team without Messi. And even less without Suarez. 76 min: Dembele comes inside and plays Alba into the space he has vacated on the left. Athletic clear. Barcelona bring on Carles P\u00e9rez for Sergi Roberto. Perez is a 21-year-old right winger who has only played 17 minutes of first-team football for Barcelona. 74 min: Barca are camped in the Athletic half. The hosts cannot get out. Gareth Ramsay can update us on the Barcelona strip. \u201cRe the first-half discussion of Barca\u2019s kit,\u201d he explains, \u201cit is actually an update of this 70s classic (with Cruyff looking as beautiful as ever): https://images.app.goo.gl/T1iXqERZufwnesbKA 70 min: More Barca probing almost gives Griezmann his first sight of goal. Athletic get a foot in but the ball breaks to Rakitic. It\u2019s a chance inside the box but he lashes over wastefully. The pressure is building. 68 min: Alba, Dembele and Rafinha combine nicely down the left but Athletic snuff them out. They hunt in packs, and make it very tough to break through. 66 min: De Marcos is off and Oihan Sancet is on. The crowd go wild. They love a young player and clearly have high hopes for the 19-year-old midfielder. Not everybody is impressed with Coutinho\u2019s imminent move to Bayern. \u201cKlopp said to Coutinho: \u2018Stay here and they will end up building a statue in your honour, leave and you\u2019ll just be another player,\u2019 emails Mike65ie. \u201cHe was right.\u201d 61 min: The resultant free-kick involves a back-heel and a wild slash and troubles nobody. 60 min: Pique is booked for a swinging arm into Raul Garcia\u2019s face. The Barca man is incensed. It\u2019s the first yellow of the game. 59 min: Barca win a free-kick 45 yards from goal. Dembele drifts it in and when it is headed out Rafinha lashes a first-time volley well wide. 58 min: De Jong is dropping between the centre-backs to start attacks from deep, in the style of Busquets. It has injected a bit of tempo into Barcelona\u2019s play. 57 min: A huge punt forward from goal sends Williams clear of Lenglet. The angle is not great and the rapid forward\u2019s effort is weak. 54 min: Lopez fires in a long ranger. It\u2019s smartly hit but always going over. The action is hotting up. 53 min: This time Dembele creates something. A clever ball nutemgs his marker and allows Rafinha a sight of goal. The substitute drives towards the near post but it\u2019s deflected wide off Nunez. 51 min: Pique pumps a very un-Barcelona like long ball forward. It\u2019s cleared but comes to Demebele on the left. A couple of nice shimmies buy him space but again he plays a nothing ball. 49 min: Alba was exposed defensively a couple of times in the first half but a typical burst down the left wins a corner. Rakitic darts on to Dembele\u2019s inswinging delivery but his flicked header has too much on it and drifts over the bar. 47 min: Rakitic has immediately started to dictate play, rolling the ball under his studs like his fellow Croatian Prosinecki used to, and playing probing first time passes into the front men. Peep! Peep! The second half begins with a nice turn from De Jong and Dembele giving the ball away. Rakitic is coming on for Alena. Barcelona need to get hold of midfield. Coutinho to Bayern Munich is on! The Barcelona director Guillermo Amor has confirmed a deal is close. \u201cWe can confirm that there is an agreement in principle for the loan of Coutinho to Bayern,\u201d he said before tonight\u2019s match. \u201cWe just have to finalise the deal.\u201d The European transfer window is open until Monday. Follow all the deals across Europe\u2019s top five leagues with our brilliant interactive \u2026 Half-time emails \u201cHope you\u2019re doing well and apologies if this bothers with your live commentary,\u201d writes Vikas Tripathi. \u201cI am late to the party but please pass on my very best wishes to Nicky and congratulate her on her decision to come out. I\u2019ve always found her work insightful and deeply enriching and I am looking forward to very much of the same. Cheers!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s half-time in the game I\u2019m watching, Huddersfield v Fulham,\u201d reports JR from Illinois. \u201cNo score in that one. They\u2019re mostly just kicking each other. It\u2019s pretty good. I thought I\u2019d check in on this game. Has Suarez been looking hungry? And yes, by that I mean does it look like he might bite someone.\u201d Suarez was looking angry rather than hungry when he was forced off, JR. He may be biting into something now though. Half-time! It\u2019s o-o at the break. Athletic Bilbao have been the better, more urgent side, but Barcelona have hit the woodwork twice. Crucially, though, they\u2019ve also lost Suarez to injury, and Messi is not available. This could go either way. 45 min: There will be one minute of added time. 44 min: Rafinha hits the junction of post and bar! He works a yard of space and wraps the inside of his left foot around the ball from way outside the area. Unai Sim\u00f3n is nowhere and the ball screeches against the woodwork. That\u2019s very unlucky. 43 min: Griezmann pops up on the right. He\u2019s looking brighter, but a pitch map of Inaki Williams\u2019s runs show he\u2019s on course to break record for yards covered. Y0u can see why Manchester United were interested. 40 min: Griezmann is caught offside. It looked miles off, but I don\u2019t think it was. He would have been clear. 38 min: Suarez can\u2019t continue and is replaced by Rafinha. That\u2019s a blow, especially with no Messi, but will at least allow Griezmann to move into the central striking role. 36 min: Capa breaks free of Alba after a clever one two. he pulls it back fro Raul Garcia but he\u2019s stretching when he shoots and the attempt lacks power. 35 min: Suarez looks to be in some pain after taking a knock. He gets some treatment on the side while Williams races down the left. He puts a cross in but Barca see it out and Ter Stegen rises to claim the second ball. 32 min: Suarez hits the post! A terrible back pass from Lopez puts Suarez clear. He\u2019s coming back to try to get onside so swivels on it and fires an instant shot off on his left. It crashes against the inside of the post and away. 31 min: Unai Lopez breaks forward from midfield and lets fly from 30 yards. It moves in the air but Ter Stegen is up to the task and drops on it. 29 min: It\u2019s a slow burner here, but luckily Andy Lynam has news from the Bundesliga opener in Germany. \u201cWe\u2019re heading for a shock,\u201d he writes. \u201cHalf-time, and Hertha\u2019s two rapid strikes puncture the carnival atmosphere created when Lewandowski put the champs ahead. Bayern looking fearsome in attack but vulnerable at the back.\u201d Liverpool\u2019s on-loan midfielder Marko Grujic has got Hertha\u2019s second I can tell you. 24 min: A Suarez backheel goes astray. Not long after Dembele is robbed. Griezmann is playing so wide and deep on the left. This front three looks great on paper but without Messi they seem lost. 21 min: Barca pass, pass and pass again but not a forward ball in sight. Eventually they give it away. \u201cThe Barca kit looks like a drunken reinvention of the Crystal Pace kit from the late 70s/early 80s,\u201d Christopher Lawton says via email. They\u2019re playing a bit like them too. 18 min: A clever reverse pass from Dembele puts Griezmann in a bit of space on the right of the penalty area. He backheels inside but no one is there. All Griezmann has done so far is upset the crowd. 16 min: Williams races clear on to a straight ball over the top. He\u2019s past the last defender and takes one touch on his knee before shooting with his right foot. Ter Stegen stands up before plunging to his left to make a smart but comfortable save. 14 min: Alena shows his class with a lovely turn in midfield. There are high hopes for the graceful 21-year-old midfielder. 12 min: The crowd whistle and shout after a late tackle from Griezmann. That\u2019s one for each side. Lenglet clears the free-kick. 10 min: The hosts are pressing with some verve and this time it is De Jong who loses the ball to leave Williams in space again. Barca finally get some possession and find Alba on the left. He forces a corner, then another but it comes to nothing. 7 min: Williams is gifted the ball between the lines after a wayward ball from Dembele. He lets fly but Ter Stegen leaps to his right and palms the ball out for a corner. That was a fine effort but Barcelona need to wake up quick. 6 min: Williams steals the ball off Alba and surges down the right. His centre is put out for a corner but De Jong clears. It\u2019s an underrated part of his game. His passing is supreme, but his screening of the defence is just as good. 4 min: A lovely weaving run from Williams leaves two Barcelona players chasing shadows. Unfortunately he\u2019s heading backwards but he\u2019ll be important tonight. Athletic have begun on the front foot. 2 min: De Jong gets a very late welcome to La Liga challenge from Raul Garcia. That didn\u2019t take long. Peep! Athletic get us under way at San Mames and immediately show their intentions with a long ball forward. It comes to nothing. Pre-match email \u201cIs Barcelona still cool?\u201d muses Charles Antaki. \u201cThey\u2019ve gone down steadily in the coolness stakes ever since they took cash for the front of the shirt and relegated Unicef to somewhere round the back. Subsequent designs have ranged from the quirky to the laughable and now the checkerboard squares have edged into simple naffness. Maybe the actual football will be entertaining.\u201d One man who does not seem to be going anywhere is Gareth Bale, despite his relationship with Zinedine Zidane seemingly having broken down beyond repair just days ago. Read the latest in that soap opera here \u2026 Philippe Coutinho is not even on the bench tonight, despite travelling with the squad. Reports suggest Bayern Munich are in talks with Barcelona about taking Coutinho on loan. Who would benefit most from that move? Email me with your thoughts. Real Madrid kick-off their season tomorrow, while Atl\u00e9tico begin on Sunday. Here are the opening fixtures in full \u2026 The most impressive article I\u2019ve read in a while was today\u2019s first person piece by our very own Nicky Bandini. The response has been touching and Rob Graham\u2019s email is typical. \u201cCan you pass on my, and hopefully a lot more than 1056 others, very best wishes to Nicky Bandini,\u201d he writes. \u201cA top class football writer, and writer in general as the beautiful piece proved.\u201d For those who missed it, here it is \u2026 San Mam\u00e9s is rocking, and these were the scenes an hour go as the fans made their way to the stadium \u2026 For the true lowdown on the new La Liga season, you will not get better than this from Sid Lowe \u2026 Barcelona have gone with a very young midfield for this game, with Rakitic and Busquets left on the bench by Valverde. A front three of Suarez, Dembele and Griezmann looks menacing though. For Athletic, I\u00f1aki Williams will lead the line and provide the main goal threat after signing a nine-year contract extension with a buy-out clause of \u00a3125m. Who knows, that may seem a snip in a couple of years? Athletic Bilbao: Unai Sim\u00f3n, Capa, Yeray, N\u00fa\u00f1ez, Yuri, Dani Garc\u00eda, Unai L\u00f3pez, De Marcos, Ra\u00fal Garc\u00eda, Muniain, Williams. Subs: Herrer\u00edn, Be\u00f1at, Larrazabal, Aduriz, Balenziaga, Vivian, Sancet Barcelona: Ter Stegen, Semedo, Piqu\u00e9, Lenglet, Alba, Ale\u00f1\u00e1, Roberto, De Jong, Su\u00e1rez, Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, Griezmann. Subs: Rakitic, Busquets, Rafinha, Umtiti, Junior, I\u00f1aki Pe\u00f1a, C. P\u00e9rez. La Liga is back, and back with a vengeance. Alarmed by the Premier League takeover of Europe\u2019s major competitions last season, Spain\u2019s top clubs have spent and spent big. Atl\u00e9tico have splashed \u20ac256m to revamp an ageing team while Real Madrid\u2019s total is closer to \u20ac300m. Frenkie de Jong and Antoine Griezmann lead the incomings at Barcelona and the battle to secure Neymar\u2019s signature is still raging. Barcelona are the champions and remain the team to beat but a trip to Athletic Bilbao is a tough way to start, especially without Lionel Messi. The Argentinian was injured in the Copa Am\u00e9rica and Ernesto Valverde has decided not to rush him back for the season\u2019s opener. How will Bar\u00e7a cope? Is Demb\u00e9le ready to step up? Will Griezmann slot in seamlessly after his controversial move from Atl\u00e9tico? Or can Athletic give the chasing pack an early shot in the arm? It\u2019s the Basques v the Catalans to see who will draw first blood in Spain\u2019s top division. Kick-off is 8pm BST.",

      "bodyText": "Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s death in prison was a suicide, the medical examiner said on Friday. Epstein was arrested in July on federal sex trafficking and conspiracy charges relating to the alleged abuse of hundreds of young girls. The billionaire sex offender was found dead at the New York Metropolitan correctional center (MCC) this month. A spokeswoman for the New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner said that an autopsy had concluded that the cause of death was suicide by hanging. An official report on Epstein\u2019s death would be disclosed on Friday, Aja Worthy-Davis added. Since the billionaire\u2019s death, serious questions have arisen about conditions at the Manhattan jail where he was held, and there was widespread speculation about the circumstances of his death. The FBI and the justice department are investigating the incident, and the attorney general, William Barr, said officials had uncovered \u201cserious irregularities\u201d at the facility. Two guards assigned to watch Epstein have been placed on leave and the warden has been temporarily reassigned. The guards were required to make separate checks on all prisoners every 30 minutes but that procedure was not followed the night before Epstein was found dead. The guards are now suspected of falsifying log entries to show they were making the checks. Surveillance video showed that guards never made some of the checks noted in the log, a source told the Associated Press. Epstein had been placed on suicide watch after a previous incident in the jail but had been later taken off suicide watch. On Thursday, the Washington Post and New York Times reported that the autopsy had shown several bones in Epstein\u2019s neck had been broken, which raised further questions about how he died. The Post cited an expert who said that a broken hyoid bone \u201ccan be broken in many circumstances but is more commonly associated with homicidal strangulation than suicidal hanging\u201d.

The medical examiner\u2019s statement also followed a new sexual abuse lawsuit filed by two unidentified women in a Manhattan district court. The complaint, filed by the civil rights lawyer Lisa Bloom, targets Epstein\u2019s estate and an alleged \u201crecruiter\u201d and demands $100m in damages. In 2004, the unnamed \u201crecruiter\u201d lured the two women into Epstein\u2019s New York mansion, where he sexually assaulted them, according to the suit filed Thursday night.

To say they need to be thick-skinned is too easy to say. When it becomes you and it becomes hurtful, it\u2019s a problem we have to deal with. It\u2019s difficult to say don\u2019t look at it. They\u2019re all on it as soon as they go on the coach. The social media companies, are they ever going to stop someone casually putting up what someone did against Tammy? That\u2019s their responsibility.\u201d</p> \n<p>Racism has plagued English football in recent months and Kick It Out has called on the Football Association and clubs to take action after \u201cdisgraceful\u201d incidents of reported abuse on the first weekend of the season. There was also outrage this week when Queens Park Rangers\u2019 Under-18 side left the pitch after receiving alleged racist abuse during a recent friendly in Spain.</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why people are on their phones during games anyway,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cTweeting through the game is a nonsense. Just watch the game. We are trying to change attitudes and there are a lot of paces forward but suddenly there are paces backwards. It\u2019s about the education of people but when they hide behind phones then it is very tough. There\u2019s still plenty of work to do.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Lampard said he has not decided whether to sell Ti\u00e9mou\u00e9 Bakayoko and Davide Zappacosta before the European transfer window shuts and insisted Michy Batshuayi remains part of his plans despite links with Roma.</p> \n<p>He hinted Antonio R\u00fcdiger could feature in central defence against Leicester.

To say they need to be thick-skinned is too easy to say. When it becomes you and it becomes hurtful, it\u2019s a problem we have to deal with. It\u2019s difficult to say don\u2019t look at it. They\u2019re all on it as soon as they go on the coach. The social media companies, are they ever going to stop someone casually putting up what someone did against Tammy? That\u2019s their responsibility.\u201d Racism has plagued English football in recent months and Kick It Out has called on the Football Association and clubs to take action after \u201cdisgraceful\u201d incidents of reported abuse on the first weekend of the season. There was also outrage this week when Queens Park Rangers\u2019 Under-18 side left the pitch after receiving alleged racist abuse during a recent friendly in Spain. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why people are on their phones during games anyway,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cTweeting through the game is a nonsense. Just watch the game. We are trying to change attitudes and there are a lot of paces forward but suddenly there are paces backwards. It\u2019s about the education of people but when they hide behind phones then it is very tough. There\u2019s still plenty of work to do.\u201d Lampard said he has not decided whether to sell Ti\u00e9mou\u00e9 Bakayoko and Davide Zappacosta before the European transfer window shuts and insisted Michy Batshuayi remains part of his plans despite links with Roma. He hinted Antonio R\u00fcdiger could feature in central defence against Leicester. Rudiger\u2019s return from a long-term knee injury would be a welcome boost for Lampard before his first home game as the Chelsea manager. They opened their Premier League campaign with a 4-0 defeat at Manchester United and conceded twice against Liverpool. Lampard believes he is on the right track. \u201cWhat people hopefully saw in the performances, particularly on Wednesday, was a team giving everything and playing good football,\u201d he said, \u201cbut now we must win.\u201d",

Until he arrived and helped set one up, Graveney school did not have a rugby team. Nor was his junior club, the splendidly named Battersea Ironsides, awash with enthusiastic recruits at the time.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I was there, we\u2019d struggle to get 15 players on the field. At times we\u2019d be borrowing players from the other team to play for us. Now I understand it\u2019s got the biggest minis section in the country. So we\u2019ve come a long way.

To his credit, it is a topic he is keen to embrace. \u201cThe more rugby puts itself out there in different communities the more diverse it\u2019s going to be. I think rugby could still do a better job in attracting different kids. In the area I\u2019m from you can teach a guy to pass and kick and play rugby but you can\u2019t teach someone to be strong as an ox or as fast as they are or have that edge in mentality. They just need the opportunity.</p> <p>\u201cI was lucky. I got taken down to Battersea Ironsides and tried to make the most of it. In this current climate, especially in south London, a lot of those kids don\u2019t have that opportunity. That\u2019s why there are a lot of things happening with knife crime and stuff. They\u2019re just bored. They haven\u2019t got anything to do. When I was a kid I had rugby, football and cricket. I did kick boxing, weightlifting \u2013 I was always busy.\u201d</p> <p>On that front little has changed. Sinckler still likes to keep active - \u201cI\u2019m not very good at just sitting around\u201d \u2013 and, in his spare time, performs the roles of defence and forwards coach for Guildford RFC in National Three.</p> <p>Professionally, he will be anything but idle in the coming months. Jones has picked only two specialist tightheads in his World Cup 31, which means Sinckler is liable to feature in every game his side play in Japan, assuming he stays fit. Having played in all three Tests on the 2017 Lions tour of New Zealand, the prospect of two pool games in four days next month does not daunt him.</p> <p>He has already crammed so much into the last two years that, to him, it effectively feels \u201clike 20 years\u201d since that eventful Lions series. \u201cThis past year there has been some big highs and lows. Australia at home, the All Blacks where we narrowly missed out. International rugby is like a rollercoaster. When you win it\u2019s the best feeling in the world but when you lose you have the whole weight of expectation of the country on your shoulders. We feel it more than anyone.\u201d</p> <p>Never more so than with a World Cup round the corner. Sinckler is poised to win his 23rd cap, still a fair way short of Leonard\u2019s record England tally of 114, but there is still plenty more in the tank. \u201cEspecially in sport \u2013 more so than any other industry \u2013 you can\u2019t stand still and give yourself a pat on the back. If you do, someone will come in and take your place. There will be a lot more tightheads and a lot more players playing after we\u2019re done.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/14/wales-england-millennium-stadium-atmosphere-warmup\">Wales close Principality roof to create \u2018fortress\u2019 atmosphere for England</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Players with that kind of down-to-earth attitude are a coach\u2019s dream.

Until he arrived and helped set one up, Graveney school did not have a rugby team. Nor was his junior club, the splendidly named Battersea Ironsides, awash with enthusiastic recruits at the time. \u201cWhen I was there, we\u2019d struggle to get 15 players on the field. At times we\u2019d be borrowing players from the other team to play for us. Now I understand it\u2019s got the biggest minis section in the country. So we\u2019ve come a long way. I\u2019m proud of the club and where it\u2019s going.\u201d By the time he finishes, Sinckler will also have done much to shatter the lazy old stereotype about English rugby being purely a sport for posh white boys. To his credit, it is a topic he is keen to embrace. \u201cThe more rugby puts itself out there in different communities the more diverse it\u2019s going to be. I think rugby could still do a better job in attracting different kids. In the area I\u2019m from you can teach a guy to pass and kick and play rugby but you can\u2019t teach someone to be strong as an ox or as fast as they are or have that edge in mentality. They just need the opportunity. \u201cI was lucky. I got taken down to Battersea Ironsides and tried to make the most of it. In this current climate, especially in south London, a lot of those kids don\u2019t have that opportunity. That\u2019s why there are a lot of things happening with knife crime and stuff. They\u2019re just bored. They haven\u2019t got anything to do. When I was a kid I had rugby, football and cricket. I did kick boxing, weightlifting \u2013 I was always busy.\u201d On that front little has changed. Sinckler still likes to keep active - \u201cI\u2019m not very good at just sitting around\u201d \u2013 and, in his spare time, performs the roles of defence and forwards coach for Guildford RFC in National Three. Professionally, he will be anything but idle in the coming months. Jones has picked only two specialist tightheads in his World Cup 31, which means Sinckler is liable to feature in every game his side play in Japan, assuming he stays fit. Having played in all three Tests on the 2017 Lions tour of New Zealand, the prospect of two pool games in four days next month does not daunt him. He has already crammed so much into the last two years that, to him, it effectively feels \u201clike 20 years\u201d since that eventful Lions series. \u201cThis past year there has been some big highs and lows. Australia at home, the All Blacks where we narrowly missed out. International rugby is like a rollercoaster. When you win it\u2019s the best feeling in the world but when you lose you have the whole weight of expectation of the country on your shoulders. We feel it more than anyone.\u201d Never more so than with a World Cup round the corner. Sinckler is poised to win his 23rd cap, still a fair way short of Leonard\u2019s record England tally of 114, but there is still plenty more in the tank. \u201cEspecially in sport \u2013 more so than any other industry \u2013 you can\u2019t stand still and give yourself a pat on the back. If you do, someone will come in and take your place. There will be a lot more tightheads and a lot more players playing after we\u2019re done.\u201d Players with that kind of down-to-earth attitude are a coach\u2019s dream. If Sinckler can avoid getting sucked into unnecessary on-field distractions, Jones will love him even more. Even in defeat in Cardiff last March \u2013 \u201cHe\u2019s a young player on the way up. Look after him\u201d \u2013 the boss was swift to protect his No 3. Back at Battersea Ironsides, either way, they care only that he is one of their own. \u201cWhen I go down to hand out the end-of-season awards it\u2019s carnage! There are kids hanging off my legs and all sorts. That\u2019s what it is about.\u201d Both England and Quins are fortunate to have him.",

The script tells us that we agree. In a vignette structure, the show plays with the ideas of our gaze, sex as performance and choice. Orwin invites an audience member on stage to simulate a sex scene between Barbie and Ken. She takes her hands away and lets the stranger repeatedly thump the inanimate body. Tracing the line between sexy and sickening, Orwin\u2019s show serves as a reminder of how sex puts us at our most vulnerable. It is in one moment empowering and exhilarating, and in the next, full of rage and despair. At the show\u2019s dark heart, it asks the thorny question of why and how some rape survivors have rape fantasies? However smartly manipulative Orwin is in the construction of her show, she is delicate with women\u2019s recorded words: probing and questioning, but never judging. This is not an easy show to watch, but one that dives deep into grey areas many others are afraid to explore. No less intimate, but in far lighter spirits, Rachel Mars\u2019s triumphant show is an education in how to talk dirty. Or rather, write dirty. In Your Sexts Are Shit: Older Better Letters (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606), Mars reads erotic letters from James Joyce, Georgia O\u2019Keefe and Proust. We learn what they liked and what they wanted. The words drip with uninhibited desire. Mars is the ideal narrator, showing childish glee at the queef jokes, but not a hint of judgment for these proudly grimy cultural icons. Contrasting these dusty pages with messages from dating apps and WhatsApp \u2013 some sexy, some bland, some so desperate they don\u2019t deserve her witty replies \u2013 Mars tries to capture the way we trade words. She celebrates how all of these intimate messages of care and carelessness \u2013 from a woman telling her how she wants to be licked, to a reminder to pick up milk \u2013 make up our relationships. She salutes how each grouping finds their own code, through long romantic letters or quick blue-ticked thrills. But really, she seems to suggest, when someone can write in a way that turns you on, wouldn\u2019t you want more \u2013 faster? Had the option of a smartphone been around then, Joyce wouldn\u2019t have been able to handle it. Sex Education, Oh Yes Oh No and Your Sexts Are Shit: Older Better Letters at Summerhall, Edinburgh, until 25 August. Read all our Edinburgh festival reviews",

      "bodyText": "We\u2019ll get to climate, and the rumble in the Pacific, but I want to begin closer to home. It\u2019s been a busy news week, so you might have missed an excellent story from my colleague Adam Morton on Tuesday revealing that a coalmine in Queensland has nearly doubled its greenhouse gas emissions in two years without penalty under a Morrison government mechanism that is supposed to impose limits on industrial pollution. According to documents released under freedom of information laws, mining company Anglo American was given the green light under the safeguards mechanism to increase its emissions by about 1m tonnes at its Moranbah North mine, in central Queensland. The case study matters, because it helps us separate spin from substance. Since taking the prime ministership last year, replacing Malcolm Turnbull, who lost the long war with the right of his party in part because of his desire to pursue emissions reduction, Scott Morrison has been trying to project a sense that everyone just needs to calm down on climate change. We all need to stop panicking, and causing a big ruckus, because the Coalition has sensible, practical policy mechanisms to ensure Australia meets our international commitments. Campaign calm down is part of Morrison\u2019s ongoing effort to straddle two domestic constituencies: the coal communities who worry Labor has abandoned them in the service of climate science, and Liberal voters in the cities who think climate change is a real thing, and the government should do sensible things to try to avert it. To the coal communities, Morrison projects a disposition of \u201cI\u2019m on your side\u201d. To moderate, rusted on, Liberal voters in the cities, Morrison regularly accepts the science of climate change, and signals he is not crazy retrograde on this stuff, like Tony Abbott was. His objective is to present as Mr Sensible; the pragmatist who will make a proportionate policy commitment and get it done. So there is no need for people to heed the (alleged) hyperventilations of activism, or have nightmares about melting Icelandic glaciers, burning permafrost in the Arctic, or tipping points \u2013 thresholds that, if passed, could send the Earth into a spiral of runaway climate change.

Aston Martin floated at \u00a319 per share, valuing the firm at \u00a34.3bn. If it had held that value it would now be in the FTSE 100 index of blue chip British businesses.

      "bodyText": "The Aston Martin Lagonda chief executive, Andy Palmer, clearly had his eye on his place in automotive history when he launched a grandiose \u201csecond century plan\u201d for the carmaker in 2016. With seven new models in seven years, his vision prepared the way to the firm\u2019s landmark stock exchange listing last October, which heralded a new era for the 106-year-old British marque. The 10 months since then have not quite followed Palmer\u2019s script. Aston Martin floated at \u00a319 per share, valuing the firm at \u00a34.3bn. If it had held that value it would now be in the FTSE 100 index of blue chip British businesses. Instead, the shares have lost three quarters of their value and they hit a record low on Thursday of less than \u00a34, making it the worst-performing listing on the London Stock Exchange\u2019s main market in the last two years. Aston Martin is now worth \u00a31bn. Investors are now questioning whether James Bond\u2019s favourite carmaker can make it through the next year without going back to markets to raise more cash to carry out its ambitious plans. Hedge funds are circling, with short sellers betting that the value of the company\u2019s shares and debt will fall. The share price fall has followed repeated disappointments for investors: spiralling costs, supply chain disruptions and, most worryingly, a slump in sales. Aston Martin had forecast sales of about 7,250 cars in 2019, the first step on an ambitious path to almost double volumes to 14,000 in 2022. However, the company shocked investors in July by slashing its 2019 sales prediction to 6,400 because of economic uncertainty in the UK and Europe. That raised questions about whether its ambitious growth plans were a step too far. \u201cThey stuck to a story \u2018that we\u2019re going to sort ourselves organically\u2019,\u201d said Philippe Houchois, an analyst at US investment bank Jefferies. \u201cThe market doesn\u2019t believe they can.\u201d Investors at the initial public offering, who included employees and customers, thought they were buying the new Ferrari, with a James Bond twist. The Italian sports car-maker converted its exclusive brand into a booming stock in New York with a valuation about 35 times its annual earnings, a racy multiple more akin to a fast-growing luxury goods company than a metal-bashing carmaker. Investors are now left wondering whether the firm is, in fact, neither of those, but just the Aston Martin of old: a maker of good-looking status-symbol cars which has gone bust seven times since its beginnings in 1913. Aston Martin\u2019s ambitions are staked on sales of its new DBX model. The company hopes that its first foray into the sports utility vehicle (SUV) market will become its most popular model, with 4,000 to be built in 2021. It is a well-worn path for luxury carmakers, following the success of Porsche\u2019s Macan, now the German manufacturer\u2019s best-selling car, Bentley\u2019s Bentayga and Rolls-Royce\u2019s hulking Cullinan.

Aston Martin\u2019s continued reliance on sales to wealthy Britons means that the worsening outlook for the UK economy \u2013 or the threat of disruption to production if imports stutter \u2013 looms large over the its prospects for the coming year. \u201cBeing overexposed to the UK is probably not a good thing at this stage,\u201d said Jefferies\u2019 Houchois.",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson is expected to make a diplomatic dash to meet Emmanuel Macron in Paris and Angela Merkel in Berlin early next week as he seeks to break the Brexit impasse. The prime minister, who has yet to leave the UK to meet any of the EU\u2019s leaders since entering Downing Street, will also speak to the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, and Donald Tusk, the European council president, by phone, the Guardian understands. Tusk said earlier this year that there would be a \u201cspecial place in hell\u201d for politicians who had championed Brexit \u201cwithout a sketch of a plan\u201d as to how to make it a success, in what was widely seen at the time as a reference to Johnson. The flurry of talks come before next weekend\u2019s meeting in Biarritz of the G7, the leaders of the world\u2019s biggest economies, where diplomats expect Johnson to be given a \u201creality check\u201d as he seeks to lobby the EU to ditch the Irish backstop. EU diplomats said Johnson would be in Paris on Tuesday and Berlin on Wednesday although the dates are yet to be formally confirmed. UK government sources declined to comment but Whitehall officials played down any hopes of a breakthrough. As Johnson prepares to make his European tour, a leaked paper from the German government suggested that his insistence that the UK will leave the EU on 31 October with or without a deal had so far failed to prompt a rethink in Brussels and the European capitals. A document prepared by officials for the German finance minister, Olaf Scholz,before talks in Berlin on Friday with the chancellor of the exchequer, Sajid Javid, stressed the importance of holding out against any renegotiation despite Johnson\u2019s \u201ctough negotiating position\u201d. The paper makes clear that while the German government does believe that the British government will carry out its threat, the EU still has no intention of returning to the negotiating table on Johnson\u2019s terms. Leaked to the German newspaper Handelsblatt,, the German officials who drafted the paper warn instead of a \u201chigh probability\u201d of a no-deal Brexit on 31 October as it is \u201ccurrently unforeseeable that prime minister Johnson will change his tough negotiating position\u201d. But its adds that the EU\u2019s preparations for it are \u201clargely complete\u201d and the bloc should hold its nerve.

His gran pipes up. \u201cBielsa,\u201d she says with a beaming smile. \u201cOooooh, I think he\u2019s lovely \u2026 He walks around Wetherby sometimes. I heard he goes into Costa. I\u2019d love to bump into him and say I\u2019m Kalvin\u2019s gran.\u201d</p> \n<p>After watching the first two episodes of Amazon Prime\u2019s Leeds documentary, Take Us Home, you get the sense you would also get more time with Marcelo Bielsa if you wandered around the cafes of Wetherby \u2013 Phillips\u2019s gran is in it more than the Argentinian and nice as she is, At Home with Kalvin Phillips\u2019s Gran is a different show.</p> \n<p>I\u2019ve made enough cheap TV to know this is beautifully and expensively made. If you love football and you love montages then there is enough super slo-mo shots of exasperated and joyous fans, owners punching the air or punching the seat in front and match footage from cool, unexpected angles to keep you interested.</p> \n<p>The cast of talking heads, from Heidi surrounded by Leeds memorabilia to Anthony and Dale sat in the pub are a perfect representation of their fans. You feel the love for the club and the hope and expectation.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/football-league-blog/2019/aug/07/marcelo-bielsa-leeds-championship\">Marcelo Bielsa and Leeds quickly show they will take some stopping | Ben Fisher</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The narrator for this journey is Russell Crowe, who has supported Leeds since watching the great 1970s side on Match of the Day as a boy in Australia. This might suit an international audience but there is something very strange about Crowe explaining the nature of England\u2019s second tier in his deepest possible voice. \u201cThe championship is a gruelling 46-game season and is considered one of the toughest football competitions in the world.\u201d It\u2019s almost impossible not to imagine Gladiator whenever he speaks, whether it\u2019s explaining the intricacies of the play-offs or pointing out that Luke Ayling has a knee injury.</p> \n<p>The series has been funded by the Leeds owner Andrea Radrizzani\u2019s Eleven Studios and to begin with it feels like some curious propaganda exercise for the Italian. He explains how \u201cone day I am going back to the dust\u201d, saying he doesn\u2019t want to take his money with him \u2013 good news for fans. He is praised by a business partner, his wife, his director of football, his chief executive. By the time the leader of Leeds city council explains what a good owner he is, you start to wonder why everyone is trying to convince you of the virtues of a man you had previously spent very little time considering.</p> \n<p>A classic football documentary needs less boardroom and more dressing room. I want Peter Reid swearing more times than is physically possible without drawing breath after coming in 2-0 down at home to Wimbledon. I want <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYDIMWpcKqI\" title=\"\">John Sitton referring to his players as Bertie Big Bollocks</a> and sacking players at half\u2011time. I want players avoiding eye contact with Barry Fry or Neil Warnock while they take years off their lives screaming at anything that resembles a footballer.</p> \n<p>Football is not like that anymore but I would like to be sure and it appears here that the dressing room is off-limits. Apart from the odd voice-over, Bielsa is off-limits and he is the reason Leeds are fascinating right now. He famously doesn\u2019t give interviews. And you have to wait until episode six to see his first sit down interview for two decades. It would be well worth teasing this through the whole series.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"53a457fd-87cf-4661-842a-384a0337c41b\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLdI7ylqZQs?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>We do hear from his old kit man at Newell\u2019s Old Boys in Argentina explaining how he is not motivated by money. There is beautiful archive footage of him being carried along by his players after a title win in 1990. Ander Herrera, who played under him at Bilbao calls him \u201cone of the best in the world\u201d, obsessed with never cheating. Adam Forshaw says under Bielsa he has become a \u201csponge\u201d so he can take everything in.</p> \n<p>Much is made of how the players have had to adapt to his methods, making them work eight- to 10-hour days, but I want to know about Bielsa the man. I know he is obsessive. I know all he thinks about is football. We all watched the press conference after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/12/leeds-apologise-after-derby-spy-row-and-remind-marcelo-bielsa-of-integrity\" title=\"\">spy-gate</a>.</p> \n<p>I want to see him in his house thinking about football all day. I want someone to check he is thinking about football all day. I want Louis Theroux there, asking him questions that are in no way related to football and then letting them hang in the air.</p> \n<p>It takes a while to get to the first match. Crowe gives their opening game of the season against Stoke such a buildup, you expect they are about to play Barcelona, or perhaps go into battle with the Visigoths of the North. Leeds go two up but then Benik Afobe pulls one back from the penalty spot. Perhaps it\u2019s my mind but the music gets even more Gladiator. Other Leeds sides would have crumbled under such pressure but \u201cthis is a new Leeds\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/aug/05/leeds-united-stoke-city-championship-match-report\" title=\"\">They win 3-1</a>.</p> \n<p>Later, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/oct/06/leeds-united-brentford-championship-match-report\" title=\"\">after a late Pontus Jansson equaliser at home to Brentford</a>, Crowe announces this is when Leeds \u201cshow off a trait that is a signature of their glory years. A never-say-die fighting spirit\u201d.</p> \n<p>At the end of episode one, Crowe\u2019s voice goes even deeper: \u201cThere is a long twisting road ahead and what is about to unfold will be one of the most dramatic seasons in the club\u2019s history.\u201d</p> \n<p>Will it? This is a club who have won the league three times, reached the final of the European Cup and the Cup Winners\u2019 Cup, who have been managed by Revie and Clough. They have had Bremner and Charles, Cantona and Hunter.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/13/salford-city-leeds-united-carabao-cup-match-report\">Mateusz Klich magic helps Leeds breeze past Salford City in Carabao Cup</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>TV has to emote and excite and poetic license is part of that \u2013 Crowe cannot say \u201cThis will all be an anticlimax and actually not too dissimilar to West Brom\u2019s season just with a more interesting manager and a less interesting mascot\u201d but there is a fine line between drama and hyperbole.</p> \n<p>In episode two we are allowed into a board meeting but it feels very much like they film a bit of it for us and then get on with the real conversation. The director of football, Victor Orta, explains he talks to the manager for an hour a day to find out what he \u201clikes in respect of the skills of the player\u201d they may try to sign, which seems very much like a conversation the manager and director of football should be having.</p> \n<p>But none of this will matter to Leeds fans. Even after two episodes you are left feeling that Radrizzani is as nice as everyone says and that his team and most of all Bielsa have inspired the club and to a degree inspired the city. Everyone comes across well \u2013 the fans, the players, the employees, Kalvin Philipps\u2019 family.</p> \n<p>The set up is really good but almost too good to make this compelling TV, which isn\u2019t really the fault of the producers. Any sporting documentary is only as good as the story they follow and you do not know what that is going to be when you begin. Last year Leeds were interesting but they were not Sunderland getting relegated to League One and they do not have the stars of Man City in the two most recent comparable versions of this genre.</p> \n<p>Football is about hope. It\u2019s that simple. Ultimately, success or failure is less important. What matters is there is a reason to believe and you get that in spades from this documentary and that is way more important for the club and the city than whether their fly-on\u2011the\u2011wall TV show is slightly sanitised.</p> \n<p>As the presenter of the Leeds podcast Phat Chants Micky P Kerr explains of the manager. \u201cI love the guy. I\u2019m obsessed with him. I think about him every day. I can honestly say there\u2019s not been a single day that\u2019s gone by that I haven\u2019t thought about Marcelo Bielsa. He\u2019s brought hope and it\u2019s the hope that kills you.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Leeds midfielder Kalvin Phillips is leaning against a table with his family. His gran pipes up. \u201cBielsa,\u201d she says with a beaming smile. \u201cOooooh, I think he\u2019s lovely \u2026 He walks around Wetherby sometimes. I heard he goes into Costa. I\u2019d love to bump into him and say I\u2019m Kalvin\u2019s gran.\u201d After watching the first two episodes of Amazon Prime\u2019s Leeds documentary, Take Us Home, you get the sense you would also get more time with Marcelo Bielsa if you wandered around the cafes of Wetherby \u2013 Phillips\u2019s gran is in it more than the Argentinian and nice as she is, At Home with Kalvin Phillips\u2019s Gran is a different show. I\u2019ve made enough cheap TV to know this is beautifully and expensively made. If you love football and you love montages then there is enough super slo-mo shots of exasperated and joyous fans, owners punching the air or punching the seat in front and match footage from cool, unexpected angles to keep you interested. The cast of talking heads, from Heidi surrounded by Leeds memorabilia to Anthony and Dale sat in the pub are a perfect representation of their fans. You feel the love for the club and the hope and expectation. The narrator for this journey is Russell Crowe, who has supported Leeds since watching the great 1970s side on Match of the Day as a boy in Australia. This might suit an international audience but there is something very strange about Crowe explaining the nature of England\u2019s second tier in his deepest possible voice. \u201cThe championship is a gruelling 46-game season and is considered one of the toughest football competitions in the world.\u201d It\u2019s almost impossible not to imagine Gladiator whenever he speaks, whether it\u2019s explaining the intricacies of the play-offs or pointing out that Luke Ayling has a knee injury. The series has been funded by the Leeds owner Andrea Radrizzani\u2019s Eleven Studios and to begin with it feels like some curious propaganda exercise for the Italian. He explains how \u201cone day I am going back to the dust\u201d, saying he doesn\u2019t want to take his money with him \u2013 good news for fans. He is praised by a business partner, his wife, his director of football, his chief executive. By the time the leader of Leeds city council explains what a good owner he is, you start to wonder why everyone is trying to convince you of the virtues of a man you had previously spent very little time considering. A classic football documentary needs less boardroom and more dressing room. I want Peter Reid swearing more times than is physically possible without drawing breath after coming in 2-0 down at home to Wimbledon. I want John Sitton referring to his players as Bertie Big Bollocks and sacking players at half\u2011time. I want players avoiding eye contact with Barry Fry or Neil Warnock while they take years off their lives screaming at anything that resembles a footballer. Football is not like that anymore but I would like to be sure and it appears here that the dressing room is off-limits. Apart from the odd voice-over, Bielsa is off-limits and he is the reason Leeds are fascinating right now. He famously doesn\u2019t give interviews. And you have to wait until episode six to see his first sit down interview for two decades. It would be well worth teasing this through the whole series. We do hear from his old kit man at Newell\u2019s Old Boys in Argentina explaining how he is not motivated by money. There is beautiful archive footage of him being carried along by his players after a title win in 1990. Ander Herrera, who played under him at Bilbao calls him \u201cone of the best in the world\u201d, obsessed with never cheating. Adam Forshaw says under Bielsa he has become a \u201csponge\u201d so he can take everything in. Much is made of how the players have had to adapt to his methods, making them work eight- to 10-hour days, but I want to know about Bielsa the man. I know he is obsessive. I know all he thinks about is football. We all watched the press conference after spy-gate. I want to see him in his house thinking about football all day. I want someone to check he is thinking about football all day. I want Louis Theroux there, asking him questions that are in no way related to football and then letting them hang in the air. It takes a while to get to the first match. Crowe gives their opening game of the season against Stoke such a buildup, you expect they are about to play Barcelona, or perhaps go into battle with the Visigoths of the North. Leeds go two up but then Benik Afobe pulls one back from the penalty spot. Perhaps it\u2019s my mind but the music gets even more Gladiator. Other Leeds sides would have crumbled under such pressure but \u201cthis is a new Leeds\u201d. They win 3-1. Later, after a late Pontus Jansson equaliser at home to Brentford, Crowe announces this is when Leeds \u201cshow off a trait that is a signature of their glory years. A never-say-die fighting spirit\u201d. At the end of episode one, Crowe\u2019s voice goes even deeper: \u201cThere is a long twisting road ahead and what is about to unfold will be one of the most dramatic seasons in the club\u2019s history.\u201d Will it? This is a club who have won the league three times, reached the final of the European Cup and the Cup Winners\u2019 Cup, who have been managed by Revie and Clough. They have had Bremner and Charles, Cantona and Hunter. TV has to emote and excite and poetic license is part of that \u2013 Crowe cannot say \u201cThis will all be an anticlimax and actually not too dissimilar to West Brom\u2019s season just with a more interesting manager and a less interesting mascot\u201d but there is a fine line between drama and hyperbole. In episode two we are allowed into a board meeting but it feels very much like they film a bit of it for us and then get on with the real conversation. The director of football, Victor Orta, explains he talks to the manager for an hour a day to find out what he \u201clikes in respect of the skills of the player\u201d they may try to sign, which seems very much like a conversation the manager and director of football should be having. But none of this will matter to Leeds fans. Even after two episodes you are left feeling that Radrizzani is as nice as everyone says and that his team and most of all Bielsa have inspired the club and to a degree inspired the city. Everyone comes across well \u2013 the fans, the players, the employees, Kalvin Philipps\u2019 family. The set up is really good but almost too good to make this compelling TV, which isn\u2019t really the fault of the producers. Any sporting documentary is only as good as the story they follow and you do not know what that is going to be when you begin. Last year Leeds were interesting but they were not Sunderland getting relegated to League One and they do not have the stars of Man City in the two most recent comparable versions of this genre. Football is about hope. It\u2019s that simple. Ultimately, success or failure is less important. What matters is there is a reason to believe and you get that in spades from this documentary and that is way more important for the club and the city than whether their fly-on\u2011the\u2011wall TV show is slightly sanitised. As the presenter of the Leeds podcast Phat Chants Micky P Kerr explains of the manager. \u201cI love the guy. I\u2019m obsessed with him. I think about him every day. I can honestly say there\u2019s not been a single day that\u2019s gone by that I haven\u2019t thought about Marcelo Bielsa. He\u2019s brought hope and it\u2019s the hope that kills you.\u201d",

It was not reciprocated. Archer had bowled six overs in a row, though, and you could feel Joe Root wrestling with whether or not to keep him on for another one.

Root could not resist the temptation, not while he had two new batsmen in. They looked jittery, too. Smith always starts like a kid who has eaten too many sweets and twice changed his mind after starting off on quick singles.</p> <p>Which meant Head was stuck up Archer\u2019s end. He was bowling fuller now, homing in on the left-hander\u2019s off stump. Head groped blindly at the ball, in a fuddle about whether to play forward or back.</p> <p>Chris Woakes, meanwhile, was hanging the ball out beyond Smith\u2019s reach. England have obviously decided that they made the mistake of playing to his strengths by bowling too straight at him at Edgbaston. Here, there were two deliveries in the first 30 he faced that would have hit the stumps. The flip side was that a lot of them were so wide that Smith was able to leave 15 of the rest of them well alone.</p> <p>It gave Smith a chance to run through his entire repertoire of eccentric leaves, presenting a cricketer\u2019s tribute to the great choreographers of modern dance.

Smith dragged his bat back down away from it like he had been scalded by the heat of it as it flew through. The same people who had booed Smith cooed in admiration of Archer. His second delivery was shorter and straighter, angled in towards Smith\u2019s hip. He flicked it down to fine leg for a single. That left Travis Head on strike. He looked vulnerable. Archer whipped through two deliveries that bit on the pitch and broke off the seam, past his outside edge. Then followed up with a wild bouncer that shot through so high that Jonny Bairstow had to leap off his feet to fetch it down again. Archer was enjoying himself and shot Head a happy grin. It was not reciprocated. Archer had bowled six overs in a row, though, and you could feel Joe Root wrestling with whether or not to keep him on for another one. There was a foreshadowing here of a problem Archer is going to face throughout his career. England will always want more from him in Test, one-day and Twenty20 cricket. Root could not resist the temptation, not while he had two new batsmen in. They looked jittery, too. Smith always starts like a kid who has eaten too many sweets and twice changed his mind after starting off on quick singles. Which meant Head was stuck up Archer\u2019s end. He was bowling fuller now, homing in on the left-hander\u2019s off stump. Head groped blindly at the ball, in a fuddle about whether to play forward or back. Chris Woakes, meanwhile, was hanging the ball out beyond Smith\u2019s reach. England have obviously decided that they made the mistake of playing to his strengths by bowling too straight at him at Edgbaston. Here, there were two deliveries in the first 30 he faced that would have hit the stumps. The flip side was that a lot of them were so wide that Smith was able to leave 15 of the rest of them well alone. It gave Smith a chance to run through his entire repertoire of eccentric leaves, presenting a cricketer\u2019s tribute to the great choreographers of modern dance. There was a Bob Fosse flick and a Martha Graham arabesque and a Twyla Tharp pirouette. Woakes, as if in irritation at all these ridiculous antics, decided to try to knock his head off by banging one in back of a length. Smith stood up and swatted it disdainfully away through square\u2011leg for four, a swift, crisp and ominous assertion of authority that suggested the precarious moment had passed and England had missed their chance. The bouncer would have been better coming from Archer but he was finally pulled out of the attack after seven overs in a row, three maidens, eight runs and the one wicket. England would have loved to have gone out for one last blast later in the day but did not get the chance. There was a break in the rain around five o\u2019clock but it did not last long enough for the groundsmen to take the covers off. Instead, they will start it all over again in the morning, round two in a contest that is likely to define the rest of the series.",

In Craigavon, Co Armagh, Bella the labrador puppy died four days after splashing through waterways. A cygnet died in a park in Southampton. Two dogs fell ill after swimming in a reservoir in Cornwall. In Rutland, a beach and aqua park were closed. Across the UK, from Aberdeen to Hampshire, Edinburgh to Lincolnshire, there have been warnings to stay out of lakes, reservoirs and other waterways after blooms of an organism were discovered.

Nor are Australia impregnable in these circumstances, especially if their mighty totem is no longer tiptoeing across the crease.

He is still 127 runs short of his vulnerable period, so easily identified after Edgbaston, in the 140s.</p> <p>Even so, it may well be that Australia are the readier of the sides to settle for the draw. In the 24.1 overs possible in the morning session England took three wickets for 50 runs under darkening skies. It was a good time to bowl on a pitch devoid of much pace, though not entirely trustworthy, and England exploited the conditions efficiently enough.</p> <p>Not much happened for 40 minutes. Joe Root began with Stuart Broad at the Nursery End with Jofra Archer gliding in from the old pavilion. Cameron Bancroft, quick to move on to the front foot, was nonetheless hellbent on survival. Usman Khawaja, who is barely capable of playing an inelegant stroke, scored a few runs down to fine-leg off Broad and then, after the introduction of Chris Woakes at his favoured Nursery End, through the covers.</p> <p>Thirty runs had been added without much bother when Archer, with his surprisingly short, casual run-up, cruised in to Bancroft. This time the ball jagged down the hill and struck the pads. Up went umpire Aleem Dar\u2019s finger and Bancroft soon asked for a review. So there was an agonising wait for Archer before his first Test wicket became a reality. No doubt he would have preferred the sight of Smith\u2019s stumps cartwheeling towards the wicketkeeper but the departure of Bancroft after an umpire\u2019s review would do.</p> <p>Following this breakthrough England were impressively disciplined. There was barely a free run on offer. Three balls later Khawaja nibbled at a Woakes delivery and the nick carried into Jonny Bairstow\u2019s gloves. So far in this match no edge has reached the fielders in the slips. In England\u2019s cordon Jason Roy has been stationed at second slip since the start of the Edgbaston Test without receiving a single chance. Who knows whether he can catch there but he has certainly looked the part.</p> <p>After Archer had completed a seven-over spell, which yielded only eight runs as well as Bancroft\u2019s wicket, he was replaced by Broad, who nearly always bowls round the wicket to left-handers now. He has become adept at this as he seeks to move the ball towards the slip cordon though this method is a tacit acknowledgment that his ability to swing the ball into the pads of left-handers is a distant memory. No matter; he can still torment them from this angle.</p> <p>Soon one of his deliveries thudded into the pads of Travis Head. Dar was just about to pull the trigger but then paused and changed his mind, an unnecessary precaution. The review demonstrated the ball was hitting the middle of middle. By now the bowlers were in the groove. Matthew Wade, normally a skittish batsman, faced 23 deliveries without scoring before lunch, which was taken five minutes early as the clouds thickened and the drizzle began.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>All the while Smith stood firm at the other end. He was as calm as ever until the threat had passed when there might be his exaggerated, puppet-on-a-string movement as the ball entered the gloves of Bairstow.</p> <p>At least England made him work hard, which is an important part of the battle. He had scored 13 runs from 40 balls during the morning session with two boundaries, a pull from a rare poor delivery from Woakes and a typically exasperating leg glance off a straight ball from Broad.</p> <p>Smith must start again on Saturday morning and his side will be confident of matching England\u2019s total only if he remains at the crease.</p>",

No doubt he would have preferred the sight of Smith\u2019s stumps cartwheeling towards the wicketkeeper but the departure of Bancroft after an umpire\u2019s review would do. Following this breakthrough England were impressively disciplined. There was barely a free run on offer. Three balls later Khawaja nibbled at a Woakes delivery and the nick carried into Jonny Bairstow\u2019s gloves. So far in this match no edge has reached the fielders in the slips. In England\u2019s cordon Jason Roy has been stationed at second slip since the start of the Edgbaston Test without receiving a single chance. Who knows whether he can catch there but he has certainly looked the part. After Archer had completed a seven-over spell, which yielded only eight runs as well as Bancroft\u2019s wicket, he was replaced by Broad, who nearly always bowls round the wicket to left-handers now. He has become adept at this as he seeks to move the ball towards the slip cordon though this method is a tacit acknowledgment that his ability to swing the ball into the pads of left-handers is a distant memory. No matter; he can still torment them from this angle. Soon one of his deliveries thudded into the pads of Travis Head. Dar was just about to pull the trigger but then paused and changed his mind, an unnecessary precaution. The review demonstrated the ball was hitting the middle of middle. By now the bowlers were in the groove. Matthew Wade, normally a skittish batsman, faced 23 deliveries without scoring before lunch, which was taken five minutes early as the clouds thickened and the drizzle began. All the while Smith stood firm at the other end. He was as calm as ever until the threat had passed when there might be his exaggerated, puppet-on-a-string movement as the ball entered the gloves of Bairstow. At least England made him work hard, which is an important part of the battle. He had scored 13 runs from 40 balls during the morning session with two boundaries, a pull from a rare poor delivery from Woakes and a typically exasperating leg glance off a straight ball from Broad. Smith must start again on Saturday morning and his side will be confident of matching England\u2019s total only if he remains at the crease.",

You\u2019re a young woman walking into a bar, looking for your friends, when a man you don\u2019t know walks up to you, grabs you, and pulls you close. \u201cSPIN,\u201d he says intensely, turning you in a circle. It\u2019s a command, not a request. When you try to pull away, he feigns sadness for a moment, furrowing his brow, and then declares his love for you, a look of pain in his eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t embarrass me,\u201d the man growls, and tries to pull you towards the door, toward a cab, towards his apartment, even as you resist.</p> <p>Welcome to The Game: The Game, where a dating sim is transformed into survival horror by filtering \u201cromance\u201d through the lens of \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickup_artist\">pick-up artists</a>\u201d, a lucrative but emotionally deformed community where poorly adjusted and manipulative men <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/nov/12/pua-pick-up-artists-julien-blanc-dapper-laughs\">teach others how to extract sex</a> from women at all costs. In a traditional dating sim, you\u2019d be presented with a variety of romantic interests, and encouraged to choose the one you like the most. In The Game, as in pick-up artistry at large, it\u2019s not about what you want; instead, you\u2019re presented with several men willing to do a wide range of things to get you into bed, each of them based on a real-life leader in the seduction community, and tailored to his specific approach.</p> <p>Created by artist and academic <a href=\"https://angelawashko.com/home.html\">Angela Washko</a>, The Game: The Game drops you smack dab in the middle of numerous highly regimented \u201cseduction\u201d routines, designed to leave you off-balance and less likely to push back against your would-be seducer, as he plays on your insecurities and makes you feel like saying \u201cno\u201d is irrational.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/252368415\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/252368415?app_id=122963\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/252368415\">Pick-up lines \u2026 watch excerpts from The Game</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Washko became interested in pick-up artists through her work within the massively multiplayer roleplaying game World of Warcraft, where she facilitated <a href=\"https://angelawashko.com/section/300206-The-Council-on-Gender-Sensitivity-and-Behavioral-Awareness-in-World-of-Warcraft.html\">discussions about the poor treatment of female players</a> and how to make the community more welcoming for all. Some of the men she spoke to mentioned pick-up artist books \u2013 particularly those by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/07/daryush-roosh-v-valizadeh-and-his-acolytes-pilloried\">Roosh V</a> (AKA Daryush Valizadeh).</p> <p>The author of books including Bang Iceland, Bang Poland and Bang Ukraine, which offer advice for men on how to procure sex in various countries through manipulative tactics, Valizadeh once advocated for the legalisation of rape on private property, saying it would make women protect themselves better and be more \u201cresponsible\u201d for their behaviour. He later claimed the post was satire, though his books graphically detail situations in which he describes having sex with women who were too intoxicated to consent, unconscious, crying or saying no. \u201cNo means no \u2013 until it means yes,\u201d wrote Valizadeh. (He has since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/25/can-someone-please-send-mushrooms-to-all-the-mens-rights-activists-out-there\">found God while on mushrooms</a> and, ironically, banned all discussion of casual sex from his forums.)</p> <p>After examining the texts and practices of the \u201cseduction community,\u201d Washko decided to embark on a deep dive, acquiring the sometimes expensive primary materials and texts of their various systems and mapping their differences. Every quote or interaction you have in The Game with a particular \u201cleader\u201d is drawn directly from their coaching videos, guide books or other primary materials. Some exchanges are recreated word for word. Simply by asking the player to experience them from the point of view of the woman rather than the man, these techniques are instantly transformed from seductive into something more like a nightmare.</p> <p>If these seduction tactics, which seem designed to achieve consent through persistence and manipulation, seem shocking and disturbing to those only casually aware of the PUA community, Washko says that\u2019s because the most extreme tactics advocated by the scene\u2019s figureheads are typically only visible to those willing to pay hundreds of dollars for their videos, or thousands of dollars for a seminar. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to see the bulk of their coaching content for free,\u201d says Washko.</p> <p>\u201cBut after purchasing those materials and watching the primary coaching videos, they were extraordinarily disturbing and incriminating \u2026 There\u2019s a shocking amount of behaviour that disregards <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/08/consent-is-not-a-romance-killer-the-mistake-of-fact-defence-for-needs-to-go\">consent</a>. It\u2019s incredible that these videos have managed to circulate without the degree of scrutiny that they should have, and I think it\u2019s largely because of the paywall.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"21f2acdc7cdc34e9318ffd1f5b4b464a07d44bee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21f2acdc7cdc34e9318ffd1f5b4b464a07d44bee/0_0_1298_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot from Angela Washko\u2019s The Game: The Game\" width=\"1000\" height=\"555\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Overriding consent \u2026 a screenshot from The Game: The Game</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Angela Washko</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a genre, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/sep/26/mystic-messenger-dating-simulations-sims-digital-intimacy\">dating simulators</a> provide a particularly resonant space to explore a transactional view of sex and dating. In most dating sims, the player is presented with a roster of romantic interests, and must tailor their actions or dialogue choices to gain positive responses from their target and win their bodies or hearts. Say or do the right thing, acquire enough points, and you will get what you came for, whether it is sex or love.</p> <p>This is, self-evidently, not how real life works: games are designed to be won through skill and persistence, whereas human beings are not preprogrammed to satisfy the desires of a random individual who finds them attractive. But Washko says that many leading pickup artists \u201cuse video game metaphors for talking about seduction. They break it down to different levels where this or that occurs \u2026 and terminology like \u2018cracking the code\u2019.\u201d When she interviewed Valizadeh, he described how, if you reach a certain point in the seduction and offend the woman, \u201cYou have to actually do a reset. There\u2019s definitely a sense that you just have to put in a certain amount of time and moves in order to get to the next level \u2026 and eventually you get what you came for.\u201d</p> <p>Perceiving any woman as \u201cwinnable\u201d, if only sufficient time and coercion are applied \u2013 like sexual treasure chests that will always open if you enter the right code or use enough psychological force \u2013 is not only dehumanising but dangerous. In this framework, no is not \u201cno\u201d, but rather just another obstacle to be overcome by working on various pressure points of insecurity, humiliation and psychological coercion. After all, if a woman simply isn\u2019t interested in a man who has targeted her for \u201cseduction\u201d \u2013 or is even repelled and frightened by him \u2013 what does it mean for him to \u201cbeat the game\u201d if not pushing her to do something she doesn\u2019t want to do?</p> <p>The Game: The Game is paired with a tense, minimalist soundtrack by the experimental band <a href=\"http://www.xiuxiu.org/home\">Xiu Xiu</a> that evokes a sense of claustrophobia and tacit threat. As various men try to back you into corners, manipulate your body, force you into situations where what you want is of no importance, the music sings with the terror of a clenched muscle.</p> <p>Washko has played The Game: The Game with numerous testers, and says that some of the most compelling responses have come from men, who come away from the experience saying: \u201cThis is a horror game. This is a nightmare. This is terrifying.\u201d Women often had a different perspective, says Washko: \u201cThis is my life. This is every day.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"http://thegamethegame.org/\">The Game: The Game can be downloaded here</a>.</p></li> </ul>",

If these seduction tactics, which seem designed to achieve consent through persistence and manipulation, seem shocking and disturbing to those only casually aware of the PUA community, Washko says that\u2019s because the most extreme tactics advocated by the scene\u2019s figureheads are typically only visible to those willing to pay hundreds of dollars for their videos, or thousands of dollars for a seminar. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to see the bulk of their coaching content for free,\u201d says Washko. \u201cBut after purchasing those materials and watching the primary coaching videos, they were extraordinarily disturbing and incriminating \u2026 There\u2019s a shocking amount of behaviour that disregards consent. It\u2019s incredible that these videos have managed to circulate without the degree of scrutiny that they should have, and I think it\u2019s largely because of the paywall.\u201d As a genre, dating simulators provide a particularly resonant space to explore a transactional view of sex and dating. In most dating sims, the player is presented with a roster of romantic interests, and must tailor their actions or dialogue choices to gain positive responses from their target and win their bodies or hearts. Say or do the right thing, acquire enough points, and you will get what you came for, whether it is sex or love. This is, self-evidently, not how real life works: games are designed to be won through skill and persistence, whereas human beings are not preprogrammed to satisfy the desires of a random individual who finds them attractive. But Washko says that many leading pickup artists \u201cuse video game metaphors for talking about seduction. They break it down to different levels where this or that occurs \u2026 and terminology like \u2018cracking the code\u2019.\u201d When she interviewed Valizadeh, he described how, if you reach a certain point in the seduction and offend the woman, \u201cYou have to actually do a reset. There\u2019s definitely a sense that you just have to put in a certain amount of time and moves in order to get to the next level \u2026 and eventually you get what you came for.\u201d Perceiving any woman as \u201cwinnable\u201d, if only sufficient time and coercion are applied \u2013 like sexual treasure chests that will always open if you enter the right code or use enough psychological force \u2013 is not only dehumanising but dangerous. In this framework, no is not \u201cno\u201d, but rather just another obstacle to be overcome by working on various pressure points of insecurity, humiliation and psychological coercion. After all, if a woman simply isn\u2019t interested in a man who has targeted her for \u201cseduction\u201d \u2013 or is even repelled and frightened by him \u2013 what does it mean for him to \u201cbeat the game\u201d if not pushing her to do something she doesn\u2019t want to do? The Game: The Game is paired with a tense, minimalist soundtrack by the experimental band Xiu Xiu that evokes a sense of claustrophobia and tacit threat. As various men try to back you into corners, manipulate your body, force you into situations where what you want is of no importance, the music sings with the terror of a clenched muscle. Washko has played The Game: The Game with numerous testers, and says that some of the most compelling responses have come from men, who come away from the experience saying: \u201cThis is a horror game. This is a nightmare. This is terrifying.\u201d Women often had a different perspective, says Washko: \u201cThis is my life. This is every day.\u201d The Game: The Game can be downloaded here.",

      "bodyText": "A widescale murder investigation is under way, with 10 suspects arrested including a 13-year-old boy, after a newlywed police officer was struck by a vehicle and killed in the line of duty in Berkshire. PC Andrew Harper of Thames Valley police was responding to reports of a burglary with a crewmate when he was dragged along the road by a vehicle after leaving his car at a crossroads on the A4 near Sulhamstead at 11.30pm on Thursday. The 28-year-old, who married four weeks ago, was described as a popular and well-regarded officer who had been with the police service since 2010. Harper\u2019s death comes as concerns mount over the threat to officers. Last week, a Metropolitan police officer, Stuart Outten, survived a machete attack after stopping a van in east London and a West Midlands police officer, Gareth Phillips, was run over by a suspected car thief in Birmingham. Phillips remains in hospital. In the year to the end of March 2019, there were more than 30,000 assaults on police officers in England and Wales including British Transport Police. Assaults on officers that resulted in injuries rose by 27% from the previous year.

I guess if a batsman scores 50 runs, 30 of which is against seam, and is bowled by a seam bowler, it would be the equivalent of being 20 not out for his spin stats, and 30 and out for his seam stats. What I want to know is what happens if the batsman is run out?

It isn\u2019t clear to me.

Vary the pace, some slow, but mainly 95 mph jobs, right on middle and leg. And if that didn\u2019t work I\u2019d do it again next over, and repeat until it did. At some point, he\u2019d not get his leg out of the way or his bat on it. And I wouldn\u2019t go for many runs.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Except... you would, because Smith scores most of his runs off his pads. In the last four years, on the CricViz numbers, he averages over 50 to balls on his stumps. The average for top-order batsmen is 15. Smith doesn\u2019t get lbw (18 out of 103 dismissals in Tests) because he\u2019s too good at hitting the ball. He doesn\u2019t miss.<br></p> \n  <p>And the main thing that makes yorkers work is that they\u2019re unexpected. You have to set up for a range of possible deliveries, then deal with the full ball.

After rain washed out Wednesday this contest moved on apace yesterday with 11 wickets falling, leaving the match delicately poised. For the sake of the series England can ill afford to underperform during the opening couple of hours of play this morning.</p> \n  <p>That said, with the weather forecast as it is we may not actually see more than a couple of hours of play all day. Rain is expected around lunchtime and it is set to linger.<br></p> \n  <p>Out in the middle all eyes will once again be on Jofra Archer after the England paceman made a promising start to his Test career yesterday evening. He went wicketless in his six-over burst but showed the rhythm and threat that have made him such a handful in white ball cricket.</p> \n  <p>Today may be a shorter day\u2019s play than most this Ashes but that should not downplay the potential significance of what unfolds. An England blitzkrieg before lunch for example could be the springboard the home side have been searching for in the series to date - especially if they can blast out Steve Smith. By contrast, should the visitors reach the first interval relatively unscathed they will retain control of the tempo of this Test and be in a position to make day five another awkward proposition for England\u2019s fragile batsmen.</p> \n  <p>I\u2019ll be with you for the next hour or so but once play begins Geoff Lemon will bring the whimsy.

See you in 15 minutes. \u201cI think what Simon is getting at is how can a batsman\u2019s innings total be split,\u201d says Gerard Mullally. \u201cBut as the calculation is total runs scored against spin divided by wickets lost against spin, there\u2019s no need to consider an individual innings score. I guess if a batsman scores 50 runs, 30 of which is against seam, and is bowled by a seam bowler, it would be the equivalent of being 20 not out for his spin stats, and 30 and out for his seam stats. What I want to know is what happens if the batsman is run out? Did Inzamam-Ul-Haq have unusually high averages against all types of bowling due to his wonderfully confusing running between wickets?\u201d Ha. He was only run out six times in Tests, you know. The record is 15. Guess who? Dear umpires, just call it off. I can\u2019t call it off for you. \u201cRegarding the prospect of a result, here\u2019s one I made earlier,\u201d says Phil Harrison. \u201cIf England get Smith in the first half hour or so, game on! Adelaide 2006 it is then...\u201d Scarred minds think alike. \u201cFor bowlers, that kind of stat makes some sense, not for batsmen,\u201d says Simon. \u201cWhen people say \u201che averages 25 against spin\u201d what is the calculation that is being done? It isn\u2019t clear to me. A batting average is the number of runs divided by the number of dismissals (I hope I\u2019ve got that right) so what is the calculation when you\u2019re just including a subset of the balls in each innings?\u201d It shows his or her ability against certain types of bowling, no? Steve Smith is the obvious example \u2013 in the last three years or so he averages 21 against left-arm spin, and 48.2 million against all other types of bowling. That has to mean something. I still think we might get a result in this game. The forecast is fine for the last two days, so there could be up to 196 overs still to bowl. There could be considerable scope for England to have an Adelaide in the third innings. \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Andrew Goldsby. \u201cThe 2005 Ashes started at 10.30am because Channel 4 wanted to be finished for Hollyoaks. The Free-to-Air-at-all-costs folks tend to forget that C4 wasn\u2019t all that much in love with cricket towards the end.\u201d A 10.30am start is one thing, 9am quite another. I can\u2019t see how it would work, and there\u2019s a fairness issue as well. That said, I know the square root of diddly squat about golf, so would be interested to find out more about how they do it. It\u2019s raining again. Bye then! \u201cWhere has all this, \u2018He averages 11 against short balls and 26 against spin\u2019 stuff come from?\u201d says Simon Gates. \u2018Is there some sort of new toy that all the commentators are playing with? It\u2019s maddening because it\u2019s all meaningless. It would make sense to talk about runs per ball or per over, but averages are just weird. PS I am a statistician.\u201d Why are they weird? I think those stats, though inevitably overdone, are generally a very good thing. Take one example \u2013 Nathan Lyon\u2019s averages against left-handers (25ish) and right-handers (35ish). That\u2019s a great stat, which reinforces what we see every time he bowls. \u201cWhat we spectators don\u2019t usually see is all the preparation each day,\u201d says John Starbuck. \u201cIf the match days were to begin at 09am there wouldn\u2019t be time enough for people to catch the right bus/train (which in rush hour would be packed out anyway), the administrators to work out when sustenance breaks should be (elevenses followed by a late lunch?), the catering staff to do their shopping, the groundsman\u2019s staff to paint lines and nurture the grass, the members to put in their drinks orders etc. unless you wish to upset a great many people. Given its cricket, the whole project would last three years minimum. Makes Brexit look like a picnic.\u201d \u201cEgads!\u201d says Peter Lee. \u201cWhat are Julie Wilson and Spencer Robinson thinking about starting earlier.... at 9am? We all know deep down inside that the joy of cricket is the sublime knowledge that someone out there is a person of leisure, whose only role in life is to cast a red ball around (slowly or fast, whatever) and perhaps knock it about a bit. Unlike the rest of us who toil at the four-letter thing we call \u2018work\u2019. Starting earlier would make cricketers just like us nine-to-fivers..... and that simply won\u2019t do.\u201d Eoin, marry me He did it. He actually flippin\u2019 did it. \u201cThe vid of the kid getting a wicket is great,\u201d says Mark Dawson. \u201cMore weirdly, the truncated/repeated laugh of the cameraman sounds just like the loop in \u2018Hands Around My Throat\u2019 by Death in Vegas. Spooky.\u201d There will be an inspection at 4.30pm. The rain has almost stopped, so the umpires are going to take another look in half an hour. If there\u2019s no rain, we\u2019ll get some play tonight. But the forecast is dreadful, so. \u201cHow would starting earlier be messy?\u201d says Julie Wilson. \u201cPlaying later seems to be manageable. Starting earlier seems an obvious thing to do.\u201d I\u2019m not sure. Who decides when play starts? In England, certainly, the ball moves around a lot more before 11am (remember all those NatWest Trophy finals in the 1980s and 1990s). What happens if a team is bowled out in helpful conditions from 9-11am and then it doesn\u2019t rain all day? They would feel cheated. Imagine if a series as important as, say, the 2005 Ashes was decided because of a rogue weather forecast. \u201cGiven that there\u2019s no play in the Test, surely someone has time to make a montage of \u2018Steve Smith leaving the ball\u2019 set to the sort of music used in the training sequence of an 80s movie?\u201d says Cath Hanley. \u201cI\u2019d watch it \u2026\u201d Oh my goodness, that\u2019s a great idea. And, with a tip of me hat to Matt Dony in yesterday\u2019s OBO, I think we all know what the soundtrack would be. The umpires have brought tea forward to 3.40pm, so that we can have a longer evening session if it stops raining in the next 12 seconds or so. There are a few spectators hanging around, but it appears the majority have started weekending. \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Spencer Robinson. \u201cWhen bad weather is forecast at golf tournaments here in Asia, tee-times are invariably brought forward to try and ensure the full number of holes can be completed. Given that everyone knew it was going to bucket down at Lord\u2019s this afternoon, why on earth was play not started at 9am? At least then we may have got through two sessions.\u201d I like the idea in principle, but I fear it would be a can of worms. It\u2019s different in golf, when everybody plays 18 holes in the same conditions. In cricket, when one side is batting and another bowling, it could get a bit messy. But it\u2019s worth trialling, maybe in 2ndXI cricket. \u201cFantastic photo at the top of the page,\u201d says Bill Hargreaves. \u201c\u2018England captain Joe Root calls for a review\u201d. The expressions make it look like it was directed by Caravaggio. The \u2018T\u2019 sign being made by Joe - does that stand for \u2018telly\u2019? Also, did you see this wonderful clip?\u201d I can hear Richie Benaud commentating on that. \u201cNow that is a beautiful piece of bowling. It was flatter and quicker, and the batsman was marooned to the crease.\u201d No news is bad news It\u2019s still raining. You\u2019re welcome to hang around if you want, but please don\u2019t expect a euphoric experience. My prediction is that play will be abandoned for the day at 5.02pm. \u201cSpeaking of indoor cricket, I was at this match,\u201d says Ben Mimmack, \u201cwhich was apparently the first indoor ODI. My main memory of the game is that during the break they had spectators trying to hit a ball up to the roof to win a prize and one bloke swung so hard he fell over. Also a couple of Aussies bludgeoned centuries. Do you know why indoor ODIs aren\u2019t played more often - I suppose weather isn\u2019t really an issue during the Australian summer.\u201d \u201cFollowing on from the Wear Red for Ruth Day at Lord\u2019s, I wanted to let you know about an event happening in Oxford this Sunday,\u201d says Sarah Whatman. \u201cThirteen teams will be taking part in Naida\u2019s Netball - a mixed netball tournament (each team must include some men). This tournament is part of Naida\u2019s efforts to raise money for the Cancer and Haematology Centre, Day Treatment Unit at the Churchill Hospital, which is where she has been treated for breast cancer since the start of the year. \u201cThe original fundraising target of \u00a31500 has been passed and will hopefully reach \u00a32000 with the tournament, raffle and cake sale this weekend. We\u2019re hoping that unlike the cricket, there won\u2019t be any rain delays. Many of Naida\u2019s teammates, friends and colleagues are taking part on Sunday and there are a lot of husbands, brothers, boyfriends and sons genning up on the rules of netball as I write. Naida\u2019s fundraising page can be found here.\u201d It sounds like a slam dunk. That\u2019s a netball term, right. It\u2019s still raining at Lord\u2019s, and the forecast suggests there is unlikely to be any more play. The outlook for the last two days is much better, however, so a result is still possible. So is world peace, I suppose. Ali Martin writes... Eoin Morgan has stated his desire to stay on as England\u2019s limited overs captain and lead the side into next year\u2019s Twenty20 World Cup in Australia \u2013 provided he can overcome a longstanding back injury. Asked about his future on BBC Test Match Special, Morgan replied: \u201cI need more time to think, that\u2019s the honest answer. It\u2019s a big decision. It\u2019s a big commitment. Given the injury I went through during the World Cup, I need time to get fully fit. \u201cIt\u2019s a physical thing. The amount of training I could do throughout the World Cup was quite limited. I was trying to get the most out of it. \u201cIt\u2019s my back. I actually need the season to end pretty soon so I can have that time to physically get fit and guarantee its not an injury risk between this year and next, then I\u2019ll be able to make a call on it.\u201d On whether he wants to take England to the Twenty20 World Cup in Australia next October, Morgan added: \u201cAbsolutely, who doesn\u2019t? But I don\u2019t want to let anybody down. When you lead you have to lead from the front. You have to be physically fit and finding form is another thing. Hopefully that works itself out.\u201d Thanks Geoff, hello everyone. You want rain chat? I can give you rain chat. There are ways. You don\u2019t wanna know about it, believe me. Hell, I can give you rain chat by 3 o\u2019clock this afternoon. But first, some news on Eoin Morgan. That\u2019s enough rain chat from me. Get ready for some rain chat from Rob Smyth. I\u2019ll be back on day five to continue the rain chat then. Thanks for your company as ever. \u201cThe hat is not the answer,\u201d writes Geoff Saunders. \u201cI used to work in Moscow and on every official holiday we had lovely sunshine - never rain. How? Because the then Mayor \u2013 Luzhkov \u2013 had the clouds around the city seeded so the rain fell outside the city and no clouds got inside the city boundaries (or outside when they had the airshows out in the boonies).\u201d I think the links between London and Moscow are already rather stronger than we might like. It was a very good call from Slough, anyway, about the rain starting at lunchtime. I don\u2019t know if Slough has any intelligence (ha ha) about when the rain might stop. It\u2019s faintly drizzling still at the Home of Damp and Cricket. \u201cI\u2019ve just checked with my team of consulting engineers and they said the idea of putting a roof on is so 1980s. These days, apparently, we\u2019d go for a fleet of hydroscopic (or something) micro drones. About ten million of them should do it, according to their rough calculations.\u201d We\u2019re back to the drones. Thanks, Garry Sharp. \u201cIf we go with Arran Watson and put a hat on Lords I wonder if you\u2019d be able to fiddle with the aircon and get it to swing all day. It\u2019d be tampering but it\u2019d be so clever I don\u2019t think anyone would mind.\u201d Just home ground advantage, Chris Lingwood, surely? Arran Watson writes in. \u201cCall it a knee-jerk reaction if you will, but with all this global warming &amp; stormy summers we can expect in UK in years to come, isn\u2019t it becoming sensible to finally get round to sticking a roof on cricket grounds?\u201d I\u2019m not sure how easy it would be to just whack a roof on the ol\u2019 Lord\u2019s. Maybe some sort of transparent umbrella canopy might suit the style. It might also be a good idea to put the kibosh on all of these charmers trying to get fracking going in the UK, and maybe put the heat on Australia to stop trying to open a new coal mine every five minutes. \u201cThis may be a foolish question, but if the average for top order batsmen against balls on the stumps is really 15, does that not suggest a winning strategy?!\u201d Very fair question, John Cox. I\u2019ve got the boffins on it. My inclination would be that it works better as an occasional surprise ball, given the ball on the stumps should be one of the easiest to hit. If you only bowl on the stumps, the delivery becomes easier to play, but if it\u2019s once in a while then the mistake is more likely. Also a batsman can miss outside the stumps and not be out, but any miss in line with the stumps means a wicket. What I meant to say what that it\u2019s raining still, and lunch was over 9 minutes ago. So we\u2019re losing match time with each passing minute now. What can be done? Surrender to the elements. \u201cThis is a much better content strategy from The Guardian: the content which was all rainy was bad content, and the content when Australia batted forever was not content which had been optimised for the domestic audience. The current content is good content. I\u2019m content.\u201d I\u2019ll have you know, Paul Griffin, that I resent this wildly. Our rain content on the first day was excellent content, so good that the New York Times wrote it up in their sports newsletter as singularly worthy of praise for our efforts in covering eight hours of nothing happening. That\u2019s as existential as it gets. In any case, we\u2019re back on rain content now, because the sky is constant in incontinence. Hope you brought a rain tent. Content? Here\u2019s Romeo. \u201cIf I were a very talented Test very fast bowler (and I\u2019m not Archer, sadly) I\u2019d bowl a whole over of yorkers to Smith. Vary the pace, some slow, but mainly 95 mph jobs, right on middle and leg. And if that didn\u2019t work I\u2019d do it again next over, and repeat until it did. At some point, he\u2019d not get his leg out of the way or his bat on it. And I wouldn\u2019t go for many runs.\u201d Except... you would, because Smith scores most of his runs off his pads. In the last four years, on the CricViz numbers, he averages over 50 to balls on his stumps. The average for top-order batsmen is 15. Smith doesn\u2019t get lbw (18 out of 103 dismissals in Tests) because he\u2019s too good at hitting the ball. He doesn\u2019t miss. And the main thing that makes yorkers work is that they\u2019re unexpected. You have to set up for a range of possible deliveries, then deal with the full ball. If you know someone is bowling yorkers, you set up for them and they become easy to defend. The marching band is still going around in the rain. Something about wearing a furry hat in this country makes people think they can treat you horribly. \u201cBen Stokes will keep bowling to Matthew Wade after the break, hopefully\u201d ... and presumably to Smith with very little hope at all. Very good, Robin Hazlehurst. If you want something to do during the break, why not Emma\u2019s latest Spin episode. Adam Collins, Andy Bull and Bharat Sundaresan on this Test as well as whether cricket should be in the Olympics and which players should have been booked for Strictly Come Dancing. Quite the first session. Three wickets for England, but they won\u2019t quite feel it was their session because Smith is still there, and looking good. He\u2019s the key again, and whether he can get enough support from a couple of Tasmanian wicketkeepers and the bowlers. England still lead by 178, so one wrong step could see them well on top. DRS did its job: England would have been robbed had Head not been lopped off, and would have committed a burglary had they got Wade. Archer was exciting, Broad was good again, and Woakes did his job despite some wobbles. Khawaja looked good until he didn\u2019t, and now it\u2019s the Smith story again. Another beautifully poised match. There\u2019s a marching band out there in furry hats, and the big covers aren\u2019t on, so it can\u2019t be raining very much. Grab a cuppa. On your cricket day... Here it comes. Not heavy, but there. Two minutes before lunch, so we\u2019ll hit the sandwiches early. 37.1 overs: Australia 80-4 (Smith 13, Wade 0) Ben Stokes will keep bowling to Matthew Wade after the break, hopefully. 37th over: Australia 80-4 (Smith 13, Wade 0) Just two slips for Smith already against Broad. Two men out on the hook, plus a backward square leg. Broad isn\u2019t exactly the most threatening with the short ball. He bowls thigh pad, and Smith glances it so crisply that it beats fine leg for four. 36th over: Australia 76-4 (Smith 9, Wade 0) Yet another leg-side nudge from Smith gives Wade the strike against Stokes, and from the last ball of the over Stokes thinks that he\u2019s through. Right-armer swinging the ball into the left-hander from over the wicket, beating his flick and nailing him in front of middle. Only problem is it pitched outside leg stump, which looked pretty obvious. Gaffaney gives it out but Wade immediately appeals to a higher authority (not God) and wins. 35th over: Australia 75-4 (Smith 8, Wade 0) Broad full to Wade, who plays to square leg but straight to the field. Not afraid to look to score, and he does so again with a bit of width outside off, smashing the square drive straight at Roy at backward point. Good shot but for the exact placement. Wade gives up and blocks straight back down the pitch. Three slips in for him, plus Roy. Cover, mid-off, mid-on, midwicket, long leg. Archer runs over from mid-off to chat to Broad, who then bowls on a length outside off. Sound advice, Jof. A third scoring attempt from Wade goes straight to cover. Three maidens in a row. George gets his answer from Richard O\u2019Hagan. \u201cI\u2019m about five miles from Slough and it isn\u2019t raining yet. On the other hand, it does look like it will hose it down any moment. Rain to start during lunch would be my guess.\u201d 34th over: Australia 75-4 (Smith 8, Wade 0) Ben Stokes on to bowl now, from the Nursery End, and he looks the most likely against Smith in the space of two balls. First he gets some swing past the outside edge, and there\u2019s another of those embarrappeals from the cordon. Then he nearly slants one onto Smith\u2019s pads, and draws a scrappy leading edge in defence. A maiden. 33rd over: Australia 75-4 (Smith 8, Wade 0) Broad again, and Wade plays out another maiden solidly. You can even sense his confidence when he\u2019s defending. 32nd over: Australia 75-4 (Smith 8, Wade 0) There is a little more pressure for Smith to get the score moving at four down, and he helps that by pulling Woakes for four. Nothing has gone well for Woakes with the short ball today. No score from the rest of the over. A number of readers are taking issue with my earlier mention of a Louisiana crossroads on the basis that the similar blues-guitar story took place in Mississippi. The Devil gets around, people. He\u2019s running secret crossroad meetings, not a corner store. The British obsession with queuing is untenable. George Davidson emails in. \u201cWhen I lived in Super Slough and the cricket was on terrestrial, it took exactly 29 mins for the weather to go from us to Lords. Any OBO readers in Slough who can advise when the rain comes please? There\u2019s been a WICKET! Is it Smith? Oh, it\u2019s Head. Slight feeling of disappointment. Great expectations.\u201d 31st over: Australia 71-4 (Smith 4, Wade 0) One left-hander for another, for another, for another. Matthew Wade is the latest off the conveyor belt. He plays Broad well at first, defending where needed, playing a hard drive to mid-on when pitched up, and leaving when wide. Broad is fit and firing right now though! He comes from wide on the crease to Head, around the wicket. Angles the ball in sharply. Straightens it down the hill too I fancy, so instead of missing leg stump it would have been crashing into middle. It hits Head under the knee roll, front leg. Somehow, Aleem Dar gives it not out. Two noises, perhaps? The angle confusing him? I don\u2019t know. But th \u2013at\u2019s what the DRS is for \u2013 the completely obvious wrong decision. Broad\u2019s appeal had been more a leap of celebration, and England immediately reviewed hadn\u2019t when they saw it hadn\u2019t been upheld. Plumb. 30th over: Australia 71-3 (Smith 4, Head 7) Woakes to head, angling up the hill across him, and this time Head manages to play inside the line deliberately. He gets a ball on his legs and glances a single, and it\u2019s time for more Smith shuffling and leaving. \u201cAlthough unofficial, I think we might actually be witnessing Jimmy Anderson\u2019s cricketing funeral,\u201d writes a rather morose Jason Ali. \u201cHe\u2019s absent and unlikely to return anytime soon; the team have moved on. It\u2019s a rather strange moment.\u201d I don\u2019t think so, Jason. You can\u2019t rely on Broad to be fit and firing for every Test, and Anderson is still the most skilled bowler in all the realm. He wants it, and he\u2019ll be back. 29th over: Australia 70-3 (Smith 4, Head 6) Broad comes back into the attack for Archer, who has done most of the lifting with 13 overs so far. Broad is bowling wide to Smith trying to get an injudicious stroke, but Smith leaves five alone, and works the one straighter ball for two runs. Doubles his score again. At this rate England are in real trouble. 28th over: Australia 68-3 (Smith 2, Head 6) Smith facing Woakes plays the weirdest defensive shot he\u2019s played, and that\u2019s saying something. Walks across and blocks it out to cover, then sidestep crab-shuffles and follows the ball for about three paces, like a goalkeeper moving along his line. Like the ball was somehow going to curve back from cover and try to bowl him? Eventually he tucks a single to double his score. Head plays the way Head plays, pushing hard at a ball for an inside edge past leg stump for two, then compactly driving a ball close enough to his stumps to feel safe against, through cover point for four. 27th over: Australia 61-3 (Smith 1, Head 0) Archer is getting movement in the air. He\u2019s around the wicket to the left-handed Head, and a couple in his last over swerved as well, including a bouncer that Bairstow could barely get to. This time he bends one into the pads. The over is a bit erratic, losing it down the leg side here and there, but it\u2019s a maiden and every ball still feels dangerous. Travellers, distant friends, you may listen to all your faves here. \u201cTuffers has just told us on TMS that England will be hoping to knock one more out before lunch,\u201d writes Steve Hudon. \u201cQuite.\u201d Drinks break. \u201cA question from the unsighted,\u201d writes Jonathan Taylor. \u201cIs Archer making the batsmen play? Last night it wasn\u2019t really the corridor of uncertainty \u2013 more definitely leave. The ball should have been going down Bakerloo but was going down the Glasgow subway instead. So is he actually making them play or think about playing?\u201d Mostly he\u2019s been bowling at their sternums, so yes, they\u2019ve played. But when he\u2019s gone to off stump it\u2019s been close enough, yes. 26th over: Australia 61-3 (Smith 1, Head 0) Woakes is bowling outswing from the Nursery end, meaning it will go down the hill away from the right-hander. Smith is so confident of his judgement of line that he steps across to one ball and just lets it hit his pad. Outside off stump. Then Woakes gets one down leg side off the hip. The prospect of getting Smith out is so remote that England\u2019s players are too embarrassed to appeal for either. They have the slightest burble of a \u201cHowz....\u201d, like when you thinking someone is waving at you and start to wave back but then you realise and it fizzles into a move of running your fingers through your hair. (The whole sequence could be called: Peter Handscomb.) 25th over: Australia 61-3 (Smith 1, Head 0) What in the rosy gates of Hell... I swear that Smith must have sold his soul at a Louisiana crossroads one dark night. He is batting on another plane. This is just a single, right. In the scorebook as one. But this... Archer did Bancroft with this delivery six or eight times. Nasty, aggressive, back of a length and sizzling in at the ribs. Bancroft got his several times. He skewed it wide of leg-side catchers a couple of times. His edged it into his body. He couldn\u2019t lay bat on it with any control. The same ball to Smith? He steps across his stumps, raises his wrists with the height of the ball, rides the bounce, and guides it off the full face of the bat into the ground behind square, into the gap in the field, and away for a run. As calm as you like, as controlled as you like. To get... off the mark. What. 24th over: Australia 60-3 (Smith 0, Head 0) So. A decent little partnership of 49, survival of 45 minutes on a cloudy morning, and then two wickets fall on the same score. Two men on nought are at the crease. Travis Head, bolshie lefty, pulls his bat inside the line of a Woakes ball, close enough to playing it to make the slip cordon break into song. Head plays at his feet to blunt a yorker. Survives. Back to back wickets! Woakes finally gets his line and his length together. Angled across Khawaja, close enough to the stumps to draw a shot, again the batsman pushing from the crease, and this time a simple edge! Twist, meet turn. 23rd over: Australia 60-2 (Khawaja 36, Smith 0) Well, if there was a buzz before thanks to Archer\u2019s bowling, there certainly is now. Steve Smith walks to the crease. All of England is so preoccupied with him that if he gets out early here, as cricketers sometimes must, the roar might damage the heritage buildings. The last ball is very wide and Smith leaves. Not sure this will be out in the end... it looks high. But by the barest of margins, it is! A proper bail-trimmer on the DRS. It was a brilliant delivery from Archer, it was pitched up just enough and seamed in wickedly down the slope. Bancroft was thinking of leaving on the line, then tried desperately to play. It cut in, beat his shot and smashed into his pad, almost outside the line of off. Hitting the knee roll, it looked wide and high for mine on a first glance. But the computer generation suggests it was cutting in as far as middle stump, and clipping the top. Archer\u2019s fine work gets reward! 22nd over: Australia 60-1 (Bancroft 13, Khawaja 36) Woakes gets his length right in an over to Khawaja, though not so much the line as the batsman is able to leave every ball but one. Still, the lack of short balls will please Richard O\u2019Hagan. \u201cWhen I was 11, a group of schoolfriends and I were caught playing football when we had been explicitly told not to do so, and were made to spend a break time standing like statues in the playground. On the basis that England\u2019s bowlers were told to pitch the ball up and let it swing, rather than dropping every delivery short, I reckon they should be sent to guard the square during the next rain break and think about what they\u2019ve done.\u201d 21st over: Australia 60-1 (Bancroft 13, Khawaja 36) Archer has the smarts to correct immediately, bowling just the one bouncer in this over to Bancroft. Pitches up and looks for something, and again beats a flick to hit the pads, then draws a miscued push through mid-on for a couple of runs. He\u2019s surviving a torrid spell. 20th over: Australia 58-1 (Bancroft 11, Khawaja 36) First bowling change, with Chris Woakes on for Archer. He\u2019s coming right-arm over the wicket to the left-handed Khawaja, angling across, and drawing a big edge first ball! Flying past Stokes to split slip and gully for four! Woakes bowls the same ball and Khawaja is edging again, stuck on the crease and prodding, but softly enough that this time it bounces to slip. It\u2019s cat and mouse, as Khawaja defends off his pads, then counterpunches as Woakes bowls too short, Khawaja standing up to force off the front foot through cover point. Four, and again with another short ball, this time that batsman using almost an uppercut flick to get the ball through point. Three boundaries from the over, and two near wickets. \u201cFeeling like it could be Khawaja\u2019s day today,\u201d emails Peter Salmon in timely fashion. \u201cEver since Barney Ronay described him as \u2018skulking around the Australian top six like Banquo\u2019s ghost\u2019 he\u2019s looked out of sorts, but looks he\u2019s due for a career definer. Like when Greg Ritchie scored 146 at Nottingham. That sort of innings.\u201d Very good. Writing alongside Ronay is a bit like playing midfield with Messi. It elevates you, but you\u2019ll never match it. 19th over: Australia 46-1 (Bancroft 11, Khawaja 24) Archer to Bancroft, and the fireworks continue to pop. Bang! A short ball hits him in the ribs. Fizz! There\u2019s almost a catch down leg, but the ball has just missed glove and lifted over the keeper from Bancroft\u2019s hip. Pop! Bancroft reaches for an outswinger and edges it fine for four! Bancroft goes from 7 to 11, much like a popular convenience store. Crack, shimmer, Archer gets a bit carried away and sends down two more short balls than the over requires. Compelling viewing from right behind the batsman. 18th over: Australia 38-1 (Bancroft 7, Khawaja 24) Broad is testing out Khawaja, in at the stumps once, twice, thrice... then he slips in the short ball. Bang. It doesn\u2019t get up very high, and Khawaja nails it backward of square. There are two men out though, so they combine to keep the scoring to two. Broad resumes an off-stump attack, and Khawaja resumes a corresponding defence. 17th over: Australia 36-1 (Bancroft 7, Khawaja 22) Archer now to Bancroft and this is heating up. A sharp bouncer startles the batsman but it started too wide of off stump to really bother him. A couple on a better line tuck him up for room at his ribcage. A fuller ball slides in and hits the pad, going down, then another holds its line up the hill from the Pavilion End to beat the edge! What an over from the man on debut. 16th over: Australia 36-1 (Bancroft 7, Khawaja 22) Broad is onto his line in his second over, and onto it well. Locks Bancroft down around the off stump, but Bancroft eventually shows one of his skills in managing a simple forward press to find a gap at cover and dart a single. Getting off strike is often undervalued in an opener. It\u2019s not so good for Khawaja though, who is beaten by a beauty to end the over, just outside off and seaming away against the slope from the Nursery end. 15th over: Australia 35-1 (Bancroft 6, Khawaja 22) Here\u2019s the real business: Jofra Archer. Can he just bowl at both ends? He\u2019s so beautiful to watch with that easy run. I\u2019d happily watch him make a sandwich. Or hang a painting. Or even be on that show where you watch him watching TV. He\u2019s bowling now, drawing a false shot from Bancroft, the attempted flick beating by pace and ballooning in the air behind square leg, but there\u2019s no one there. There is a leg slip, but it goes square of him. To Khawaja, Archer draws a big appeal from the slips as a ball slips down leg and beats the attempted glance. 14th over: Australia 34-1 (Bancroft 5, Khawaja 22) Good morning from England, all. Thanks JP for the build-up extravaganza. I hope that\u2019s not overstating the case. Stuart Broad starts in understated fashion, with a proper loosener on the thigh pad that Khawaja glances for two. Thanks very much. Then another goes in a similar direction, not quite as short and a bit squarer. Another leg-stumper is flicked square cleanly but a boundary is saved as it goes straight to the man at square leg. The players and officials are making their way out to the middle at Lord\u2019s. The clouds have rolled in, it\u2019s cool, and the floodlights are on. England will be hungry for Australian wickets. Stuart Broad is at the top of his mark... Now it\u2019s over to Geoff. Jimmy Anderson has been out warming up, jogging, and rolling his arm over. There\u2019s still little expectation of seeing him in whites before the fourth Test but encouraging nonetheless to see him active. Mike Daniels has greater confidence in Jason Roy than some of us. \u201cRoy\u2019s got a perfectly ok technique to play Test Cricket,\u201d he emails. \u201cThose wanting to criticise his technique on the basis of yesterday\u2019s dismissal are barking up the wrong tree. Far more important is the lack of red-ball batting he has had and being asked to open in Test cricket when he doesn\u2019t do that in red-ball cricket anyway. He\u2019s looking out of his comfort zone because he is.\u201d Almost time for the five-minute bell. It will be rung today by Shane Keith Warne. \u201cI was much excited to see Jason Roy make the transition from ODI to Tests in the mould of Virender Sehwag,\u201d emails Amod Paranjape. \u201cI am no expert but watching him I feel he has changed his game and is much better playing his natural game.\u201d I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve seen enough of Roy out in the middle to be certain what he\u2019s doing. It appears to me as though his technique is ill suited to opening against attacks as disciplined as Australia\u2019s at Test level (see Gary Naylor\u2019s tweet below). However, I don\u2019t feel as though I\u2019ve seen him throw the bat at everything and bludgeon his way into Test cricket a la David Warner, which may be the way forward, rather than pretending to be something he isn\u2019t. Thanks Rick. Any excuse to roll out this banger. Sky did some lovely analysis on this yesterday, highlighting the box outside of which Roy\u2019s hands should not move, but tend to all to often. Nathan Lyon matched Dennis Lillee\u2019s career haul of Test wickets yesterday and as Ali Martin reports the Australian was as unfazed and knockabout as ever at reaching the milestone. I really struggle to see myself up with the likes of Warne and McGrath. It doesn\u2019t sit well with me. Those guys are legends. The TMS link for overseas listeners has been supplied by Peter Crees. After watching yesterday\u2019s play, what you would not be minded to do, writes Geoff Lemon, is write about Peter Siddle. So guess what Geoff\u2019s done? He\u2019s only bloomin gone and written about Peter Siddle. Siddle was not fashionable then nor is he fashionable now. He bowls seam on a length, over and over. He does not have rocket-speed or booming swing. During every match he plays for Australia you will find people questioning his presence, Australia supporters well represented among them. And during every match you will find Siddle striving to do what needs to be done. \u201cCurrently lying in a hammock in SW France\u201d humblebrags Dan Catton, \u201cas my kids charge around a tree-climbing and zip-wire park. Not a cloud in the sky and beach weather forecast for later.\u201d Ok, ok, we get it. \u201cGiven the state of play, should England fans pray for the rain to come sooner or later in St John\u2019s Wood?\u201d Ask Geoff again in an hour or so. With overcast conditions and a newish ball England will expect to make early inroads into Australia\u2019s batting order this morning. Should they fail then rain will be prayed for. Should they succeed then they\u2019ll want to keep on as long as possible. More brilliance from the superb Ben Jones. \u201cWhy are we playing the Ashes in the Autumn rather than in Summer?\u201d asks Paul Cunningham, somewhat rhetorically. \u201cBecause the former pinnacle of cricket now has to play second fiddle to the ODI tournament?\u201d Well, it is still summer, and the World Cup was a roaring success, so I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re going to be on the same page with this one. Dean Kinsella is worried. I share his sentiments. \u201cI fear.\u201d he emails. \u201cI fear for England and Wales. I don\u2019t see this ending well. I\u2019m also somewhat concerned that the cricket may not go too well today. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t have taken Broad out of the attack so quickly last evening. He looked like he might have been on a roll. Should have been backed to the hilt and wound up to really blast out some Aussies. Instead, the new toy had to be played with - untested and unable to bowl the right line. England\u2019s next innings will be after some rain and a covered pitch. I fear they will taste Ireland\u2019s dismay from a couple of weeks back. I fear.\u201d Alternatively, skittle Australia out before lunch, smack a quick 250 on Saturday and have 120+ overs to level the series on a day five pitch? Nah, I don\u2019t think so either. Don\u2019t forget that fundraising continues for the Ruth Strauss Foundation following yesterday\u2019s emotional scenes at Lord\u2019s when the home of cricket was resplendent in red and Andrew Strauss ensured there wasn\u2019t a dry eye in the house. Rory Burns was one of the few England batsmen to prosper yesterday, giving Andy Bull the opportunity to ruminate on the work ethic of the lucky. Even Burns\u2019s nearest and dearest surely would not say he was a handsome batsman. His stance makes him look as if he spent the previous night sleeping in the front seat of a car. But it works for him, and he weathered two superb spells, one from Josh Hazlewood at the Nursery End and another from Pat Cummins coming in from the Pavilion. Speaking of the forecast, here\u2019s some more detail. Graeme Hull takes line honours for the day\u2019s first email, and he opens the floodgates with a very popular question, for which there is no satisfactory answer. \u201cGiven the forecast,\u201d he asks, \u201cis there any real reason why play couldn\u2019t start at 9am to give more real playing time, rather than waiting for the scheduled start?\u201d Here\u2019s how the most important 22 yards of cut and rolled London turf look this morning. You\u2019d have to expect the variable bounce we witnessed yesterday will only continue, and it certainly looks dry enough for spin to become increasingly important. Before play resumes there\u2019s plenty of time to put the kettle on, make a brew, read the paper and have a chat. What better place to begin than with Vic Marks\u2019s report from day two? Jofra Archer, Stuart Broad and Jack Leach all hung around long enough for Bairstow to post his 50, his first excursion into double figures in Test cricket this summer. There were signs the old fluency was returning until he attempted to wallop a Lyon off-break into the grandstand. He managed only to find Khawaja at deep square-leg but at least England had crept to a disappointing total rather than a disastrous one. Hello everybody and welcome to live OBO coverage of day three of the second Test from Lord\u2019s. After rain washed out Wednesday this contest moved on apace yesterday with 11 wickets falling, leaving the match delicately poised. For the sake of the series England can ill afford to underperform during the opening couple of hours of play this morning. That said, with the weather forecast as it is we may not actually see more than a couple of hours of play all day. Rain is expected around lunchtime and it is set to linger. Out in the middle all eyes will once again be on Jofra Archer after the England paceman made a promising start to his Test career yesterday evening. He went wicketless in his six-over burst but showed the rhythm and threat that have made him such a handful in white ball cricket. Today may be a shorter day\u2019s play than most this Ashes but that should not downplay the potential significance of what unfolds. An England blitzkrieg before lunch for example could be the springboard the home side have been searching for in the series to date - especially if they can blast out Steve Smith. By contrast, should the visitors reach the first interval relatively unscathed they will retain control of the tempo of this Test and be in a position to make day five another awkward proposition for England\u2019s fragile batsmen. I\u2019ll be with you for the next hour or so but once play begins Geoff Lemon will bring the whimsy. If you want to join in this pre-play fun you can drop me an email or a tweet.",

      "bodyText": "An Aston Martin DB5 used to promote the James Bond film Thunderball has sold for $6.4m (\u00a35.2m) at the world\u2019s biggest classic car auction in California. The car, which was once owned by the British JCB billionaire and Tory party donor Lord Bamford, exceeded its auction estimate and became the world\u2019s most expensive DB5. Barney Ruprecht, of the auctioneer RM Sotheby\u2019s, said: \u201cWe are beyond thrilled \u2026 and proud to have set a new record for the most valuable DB5 sold at auction. Beyond this new auction record, the enormous amount of interest in the car and excitement surrounding it ahead of the auction solidifies its status as the \u2018most famous car in the world\u2019, along with the collector car hobby\u2019s great respect for the Aston Martin brand.\u201d The DB5 was one of the star lots at the Monterey Car Week, which is expected to generate sales in excess of $380m. More than 100 cars are expected to sell for more than $1m each. Sean Connery, who drove a DB5 in two of the 007 films, said: \u201cThese DB5s are amazing. I remember the Furka Pass tyre shredding [in a car chase in Goldfinger], as well as the promotional events with these cars \u2013 they have become increasingly iconic since Goldfinger and Thunderball. In fact, I bought a very fine DB5 myself relatively recently.\u201d The car is not the one used in the filming, but it is an almost exact replica commissioned by film-maker Eon Productions and used at promotional events for Thunderball. It includes 13 modifications created for Bond, including a Browning .30-calibre machine gun in each bumper, tyre slashers mounted on its wheel hubs and a bulletproof rear screen that can be raised and lowered from behind the rear windscreen. Later on Friday a rare road-legal silver McLaren F1 car is expected to sell for between $21m and $23m. If it sells for more than $22.5m, it will become the most expensive British car ever sold. \u2022 This article was amended on 21 August 2019 because an earlier version referred to a 30-calibre machine gun, when .30-calibre was meant. This has been corrected.",

She talked to teachers and pupils and found that one reason children were not settling down to learn, why they acted as if they were not fully present, was that they never took off their coats. Why not? Because their lockers were in a badly lit corner where kids were liable to get bullied or beaten up, so no one ever went there. Cottam altered the design, bringing the lockers into the daylight: bullying went down and, thanks to that and a series of other such moves, academic attainment went up.</p> <p>In the last decade or more, she\u2019s been applying a similar approach to public services. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/07/radical-help-hilary-cottam-review-revolutionise-welfare-state\" title=\"\">Radical Help</a> \u2013 a book that\u2019s been published from Denmark to South Korea \u2013 she describes five \u201cexperiments\u201d in different areas of public provision, touching on every stage of life: adolescence, work, healthcare, social care for the elderly and social work for so-called troubled families.

Much of the current discussion about elderly care focuses on budgets and structures, imagining a new multibillion-pound institution on a par with the NHS. But Cottam started with the most fundamental unit of all: a single human being. She tells the story of Stan, a frail 90-year-old man whose main problem was loneliness. He lived in sheltered accommodation and longed to talk to other people, to share the music of his youth. This didn\u2019t require an elaborate new bureaucracy or expensive new council programme. All it took was a volunteer to find a way for Stan to play his choice of Sinatra songs to a few other people down the phone, so they could listen to the music together.

Circle schemes in Nottingham, Rochdale and elsewhere reported astonishing results: those once written off as housebound, reduced to passive recipients of the occasional, state-mandated visit from a health visitor or cleaner, were instead forging friendships, getting out more and finding new purpose in their lives. They became healthier too, turning less often to the NHS.</p> <p>That\u2019s because many of the problems they had weren\u2019t really medical, they were social. And that is the core insight of Radical Help: that what can turn lives around is not a hulking bureaucracy of targets and tick-boxes, but simple, human relationships. The current welfare state, says Cottam, is a \u201ctransactional, pass-the-parcel model\u201d: she describes how one single mother in Swindon had passed through the hands of no fewer than 73 different clipboard-carrying professionals, whether social workers, health visitors or police officers, costing the taxpayer \u00a3250,000 a year.

This, she insists, is not a project of the right but the left.

Their peaceful protest turned bloody when Manchester magistrates ordered Yeoman \u2013 a private militia paid for by rich locals \u2013 to storm the crowd with sabres.</p>\n    <p>Most historians agree that 14 people were definitely killed in the massacre \u2013 15 if you include the unborn child of Elizabeth Gaunt, killed in the womb after she was beaten by constables in custody. A further three named people are believed to have either been stabbed or trampled to death.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why is it called Peterloo?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The name was first coined five days after the massacre by James Wroe, editor of the Manchester Observer, the city\u2019s first radical newspaper (no relation to the Observer of today). According to historian Robert Poole, Peterloo was \u201ca bitter pun, comparing the cowardly attacks by the Yeomanry and soldiers on unarmed civilians to the brutality suffered at Waterloo.\u201d</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What did the protesters want?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>They wanted political reform. The years leading up to Peterloo had been tough for working class people and they wanted a voice in parliament to put their needs and wants on the political agenda, inspired by the French Revolution across the Channel. Machines had begun to take jobs in the lucrative cotton industry but periodic trade slumps closed factories at short notice, putting workers out on the street. The Napoleonic Wars, which ended in 1815 with the Battle of Waterloo, had taken a heavy toll on the nation\u2019s finances, and 350,000 ex-servicemen returned home needing jobs and food. Yet those in power seemed more interested in lining their own pockets than helping the poor.</p>\n    <p>At that point, only the richest landowners could vote, and large swathes of the country were not represented in Westminster. Manchester and Salford, which then had a population of 150,000, had no MP, yet Oxford and Cambridge Universities had their own representation. At the time the extension of the vote to all men, let alone women, was actively opposed by many who thought the vote should be restricted to those of influence and means.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why is Peterloo important?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>It paved the way for parliamentary democracy and particularly the Great Reform Act of 1832 which created new parliamentary seats, particularly in the industrial towns of the north of England. It also led to the establishment two years later of the Manchester Guardian by John Edward Taylor, a 28-year-old English journalist who was present at the massacre and saw how the \u201cestablishment\u201d media sought to discredit the protesters.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/helenpidd\"><b>Helen Pidd</b></a>, <i>North of England editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>There was a low-key appearance by the environmental campaigners Extinction Rebellion in bright red robes, while 100 volunteers played the role of \u201cLaurels\u201d \u2013 those who carried laurel branches at Peterloo as a symbol of peace and amity.</p> \n<p>Mike Leigh, the award-winning director of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/03/peterloo-review-mike-leigh-epic-history-lesson\">film about Peterloo</a> released last year, said the incident was \u201ctotally relevant\u201d to today, drawing parallels with the protests in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/hong-kong\">Hong Kong</a>, Brexit and the public\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.hansardsociety.org.uk/publications/reports/audit-of-political-engagement-16\">dwindling confidence</a> in politicians.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d714575f61ba34006cbf5abcfe547017a9c296b5\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d714575f61ba34006cbf5abcfe547017a9c296b5/0_179_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Environment activists clad in red were part of the anniversary commemorations.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Environment activists clad in red were part of the anniversary commemorations.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Waugh/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cIf the guys who were here 200 years ago could get into a time machine and come forward to 2019 and discover that people have the vote and they don\u2019t use it, they would be absolutely outraged, horrified and disgusted and would find it obscene,\u201d he said on the fringes of the event.</p> \n<p>Leigh described Brexit as a \u201ccomplete disaster\u201d, adding: \u201cPeople actually haven\u2019t got a voice.

      "bodyText": "The Greek sculptor Takis, who has died at 93 during the run of an acclaimed Tate retrospective of his ingenious creations, was half artist and half mad scientist. His works of art look like experiments \u2013 because that\u2019s what they are. He tapped into the fundamental forces of magnetism and electricity to make eerily beautiful contraptions that illuminate modern physics. When Takis started to make scientific art in the 1950s, he was defying a widespread belief that art and science were incompatible and opposite ways of seeing the world. The bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the use of lethal gas at Auschwitz tainted science in the eyes of many artists and writers. Meanwhile, scientists saw the cultural elite as snobbish and pretentious \u2013 or so claimed CP Snow in his 1959 lecture The Two Cultures. Yet while Snow\u2019s claims about science and art as two hostile cultures were prompting earnest radio and TV debates, Takis was happily playing in no man\u2019s land with bits of wire and magnetised nails.

Perlmutter, who reportedly advises Trump on veterans\u2019 affairs and donated millions to conservative campaigns in the 2018 midterms, has also drawn criticism from other quarters. Last week, actor Armie Hammer also pointed out the connection, tweeting that while numerous celebrities were distancing themselves from gym chains SoulCycle and Equinox because the parent company\u2019s chairman, Stephen Ross, was throwing a lavish Trump fundraiser, \u201cit might be a good time to mention that one of Trump\u2019s largest financial contributors is the chairman of Marvel Entertainment (Isaac Perlmutter)..... jussayin\u201d. Marvel: The Golden Age 1939\u20131949, which now carries an introduction by Marvel editor Roy Thomas, is published in September.",

We still think he is gong to be at least four, five weeks away. The big thing with Andy is not to put a timescale on him.

      "bodyText": "And that\u2019s all from the Friday blog for this week. Enjoy your sporting weekend. Brendan Rodgers has bestowed his regal approval on Frank Lampard, manager of Frank Lampard\u2019s Chelsea, ahead of Leicester\u2019s Sunday visit to Stamford Bridge. Frank and Jody (Morris) are a perfect fit for it. They both understand the fabric of the club. Frank understands the policy at the club, with the transfer ban, and he is giving young players a chance, which perhaps in the past those young players wouldn\u2019t get that opportunity. But, under Frank and Jody, young players are getting a chance to flourish now and he is doing a good job. In the games I have seen, Chelsea have played with a good tempo and intensity. Frank understands the importance of giving those young players a chance, but he also knows he has to win matches and get results, and I believe he will do well there. The referee when Everton take on Watford will be Jon Moss. There is a musical link beyond his sharing a name with Culture Club\u2019s drummer. He is now the proud owner of a record shop/coffee shop called, of course, Vinyl Whistle. It\u2019s on the Otley Road in Leeds, famed for its near-impossible pub crawl. (14-23 pubs/bars). Here, another fellow ref brings the banter. It looks pretty useful for your indie landfill needs. Arsenal look to build on last week\u2019s win at Newcastle, but will have to get past some Dyche-ball. Here\u2019s today\u2019s chortlesome Fiver chunks. Pogba latest: nothing is happening. But it might. Maybe. First, his brother, Mathias Pogba, speaking to El Chiringuito: \u201cI can\u2019t assure you that he is going to stay at United. \u2018We know he wanted to move, but he\u2019s not to blame. He\u2019s waiting. He works hard and we\u2019ll see what happens. In football you never know. Until September 2 everything can happen.\u201d Next, Zinedine Zidane: \u201cPaul is a Manchester United player and we must respect that, I am happy with my players, thinking only about tomorrow\u2019s game. The players are the same. We are ready to play a good game, we want to compete. I have the best players here, no doubt, I always say that.\u201d Two more weeks of such nonsense to go, then. Marco Silva takes on his former club at 3pm on Saturday. Manchester City v Tottenham is Saturday\u2019s plum Prem game, so here\u2019s some team news. Fuller preview to follow. Midfielder Fernandinho is back in contention as Manchester City have close to a fully-fit squad available for Saturday\u2019s Premier League clash with Tottenham. The Brazilian missed last week\u2019s opener against West Ham having returned to training late following international duty. Winger Leroy Sane is the only major absentee as he awaits knee surgery while left-back Benjamin Mendy is unlikely to be involved as he builds up match fitness. Tottenham are still without hamstring injury victims Dele Alli and Ryan Sessegnon. Juan Foyth and Son Heung-min are both suspended but Spurs are otherwise at full strength. Christian Eriksen and Jan Vertonghen are vying for starts while Giovani Lo Celso could be on the bench following his deadline day move from Real Betis. Even more Liverpool? Here\u2019s a preview of their Saturday 3pm game at Southampton. Time for Palace fans to panic? Roy Hogdson has some not-so soothing words. Via PA Media Crystal Palace boss Roy Hodgson admits he cannot rule out Wilfried Zaha leaving during the European transfer window - but hopes the forward will fully commit himself to the season ahead at Selhurst Park. With the European transfer window still open until September 2, there is a possibility Zaha could further his career away from England. Hodgson, though, hopes it will be the Eagles who now get to see the best of the 26-year-old former Manchester United man for the remainder of the campaign. \u201cWell there is not too much point worrying about it, if you are asking me \u2018would I welcome it?\u2019 the answer is no,\u201d said the Palace boss when the issue was raised at a press conference, in quotes broadcast by Sky Sports. \u201cI would rather that he now gets his head down and commits himself to the season that we have got in front of us and commits himself to helping me, the coaching staff and the players into having another season that we can regard as a good one. That is what I would like. \u201cBut of course I don\u2019t suppose you can ever rule out the possibility that it might happen because the transfer window in Europe is still open until the end of the month - but it is not something which I am going to worry about because it is something that I really cannot affect.\u201d Asked what Zaha\u2019s attitude had been like since his return, Hodgson replied: \u201cIt has been good, very good.\u201d And Suzanne Wrack has been talking to Carla Ward, the Sheffield United women\u2019s team manager. Ben Fisher has heard from Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl, coming off the back of last week\u2019s horror show at Burnley. More Liverpool news. It appears that Dejan Lovren\u2019s move to Roma is OFF, according to widespread reports. So one of the world\u2019s best defenders - according to the man himself - looks to be staying at Anfield. Here\u2019s the team news from the Tyrone Mings derby. Manuel Pellegrini is ready to end West Ham\u2019s Brighton hoodoo, which amounts to one point from four games since the Seagulls were promoted: It\u2019s just a statistic. Every game in football is different. Brighton started very well, with a clear style of play under their new manager. Playing in their stadium is always difficult so we must be very focused and play with a high pace and intensity. Brighton were really very good last Saturday, and Shane Duffy in particular was magnificent. This should be a harder assignment than the four previous ones that the Hammers have flunked. Anyway, that\u2019s all from me: I\u2019m going to swan off into the weekend. John Brewin will be here shortly with the rest of the day\u2019s news: emails here please. Bye! Some news from Chelsea, who have successfully made Stamford Bridge a hostile environment for touts: The good news is, he thinks he has \u201cmany chances\u201d of being fit to play this weekend: Adrian has spoken about his supporter-inflicted injury, describing it \u201ca strange, weird situation\u201d. Zinedine Zidane has changed his tune when it comes to Gareth Bale, who will now be in the squad for their curtain-raiser against Celta Vigo. This is from today\u2019s press conference: It seemed that [Bale] was going to leave but today he is here with us. The dynamics are changing, things are changing. From now on, I will rely on him, as on others. I will rely on all the players who are here. He has his place, he is an important player and I hope that all the players will make the task of choosing a team difficult. We will, as ever, preview every Premier League game before the day\u2019s out. Here\u2019s the first of the day: Hello again! I have mainly spent my lunch break accepting delivery of a desk, and then on hold for a merry half-hour arranging return of said desk, which has no legs. I do not feel rested. Meanwhile Amazon Prime\u2019s Leeds-focused documentary, Take Us Home, has inspired Max Rushden to pick up his pen: A bit of Sheffield United news, as the Blades prepare to host a Premier League game at Bramall Lane for the first time in more than 12 years, courtesy of PA Media: Sheffield United manager Chris Wilder must decide whether to recall Billy Sharp to his starting line-up for Sunday\u2019s home game against Crystal Palace. Sharp stepped off the bench to clinch the Blades a point in their draw at Bournemouth on the opening day and could return for their first home game of the season. Club record signing Oliver McBurnie is hoping to make his first start and Everton loanee Muhamed Besic could feature, but fellow summer recruits Lys Mousset and Ravel Morrison are not ready for first-team action. Crystal Palace will have defender Jeffrey Schlupp back from an ankle problem for the trip to Bramall Lane. Defender Gary Cahill, midfielder James McCarthy and Victor Camarasa should all be involved again after the new signings featured for the under-23s in midweek. Centre-back James Tomkins continues his recovery from a groin problem sustained at the end of last season, while Mamadou Sakho (knee) also remains unavailable And with that, I\u2019ll hand you back to Simon after his ultra-relaxing lunch hour. Email him here if you fancy. Bye. A stalled La Liga start for Eden Hazard: the Belgian is out of Real Madrid\u2019s season-opener against Celta Vigo with a thigh injury that is expected to sideline him for around three or four weeks. Pep speaks, and he plays up Tottenham\u2019s threat, describing them as \u201cthe second best team in Europe\u201d, adding: \u201cSince I came to England they have always been a real contender, always they were tough games.\u201d He\u2019s not underestimating any of the other contenders either: \u201cLiverpool and Tottenham are impressive, Chelsea have played very well over the two games they lost. We saw in United [against Chelsa] the real quality they have up front, they seem in a new mood, Arsenal bought good players, Tottenham the same.\u201d He was tight lipped on tomorrow\u2019s team, and whether Bernardo Silva would be back in the team in the light of Rodri\u2019s fine debut at West Ham. Some more nuggets of team news: Everton will be without Andre Gomes for Watford\u2019s visit to Goodison. Fabian Delph and Leighton Baines are both still out. While Southampton should have new signing Kevin Danso available for the visit of Liverpool. Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg should also be involved after an illness. Moussa Djenepo could also be set for a debut. Down to Stamford Bridge, where Frank Lampard has been speaking about the abuse faced by Tammy Abraham on social media after his missed penalty in the Super Cup shootout on Wednesday. \u201cTammy wanted to stand up and be brave and take the penalty,\u201d said the Chelsea manager, \u201cand then a few hours later someone sitting behind a keyboard or a phone is saying the most disgusting things possible. I don\u2019t know how these platforms work but something should be done. I\u2019m so angry for Tammy and that\u2019s not what we\u2019re about as a club and the work we do against discrimination. As for the challenge posed by Leicester, Sunday\u2019s opponents: \u201cIt\u2019s a big game for us, in front of our home fans for the first time this season, I know Brendan well he\u2019s a good manager, with a good mix of experienced and young players.\u201d Regarding his transfer-ban hindered squad, he insisted Michy Batshuayi was here to stay. \u201cThe important thing is he trains at the top level every day, and plays how I like strikers to play \u2013 constant movement and trying to score goals. He\u2019s rather less forthcoming when invited to comment on Manchester City escaping a transfer ban and whether that might assist their own appeal. \u201cI don\u2019t know, as I don\u2019t know the difference between our case and theirs. So I don\u2019t want to comment on something where I don\u2019t have a full understanding of the details.\u201d Thanks Simon. Afternoon all. It may be Pep hour but his opposite number tomorrow evening, Mauricio Pochettino, has been chatting about Spurs\u2019 trip to the Etihad, the scene of one of their more memorable nights last term. And the Spurs coach is up for it: \u201cI\u2019m so happy to compete against [Guardiola] again,\u201d he said. \u201cFor me, he is one of the best managers in the world and that means we are in the same race, which is so important for myself.\u201d The coach says he\u2019ll continue to pick Christian Eriksen, despite the ongoing speculation about his impending exit. Though he could only mutter \u201cwe\u2019ll see\u201d when asked about whether the Dane will be in Saturday\u2019s starting XI. \u201cFor me it is the same between a player who has one year on his contract and one who has five years, the section is not for the length of the contract it is for the performance. After five years you all should know to avoid this question, because you know I will take the decision based only on performance, and not their personal situation with the club.\u201d Son Heung-min and Juan Foyth will miss out tomorrow through suspension. Tottenham are also still without Dele Alli and Ryan Sessegnon. We have entered Pep hour, with Guardiola scheduled to give his press conference at about 1.30pm. Tom Davies is going to be here for it, as I\u2019m going to step away from the blog for a bit. Send him your emails here, if you could. Bye for now! News just in from the world\u2019s-gone-mad department: Andy Hunter was at Jurgen Klopp\u2019s morning briefing, and has more on Adri\u00e1n\u2019s ankle injury: Elsewhere, the women\u2019s Champions League draw is about to happen. Join John Brewin here, if you wish: Jamie Jackson was at Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s press conference this morning, and this is what he\u2019s written about it: Here\u2019s Sean Dyche on Arsenal, and the prospect of playing the Gunners, who always seem to get a dodgy penalty or handball goal against Burnley, with VAR in place: I am not going to start harping on about some of the decisions that have gone against us but that has certainly played its part. It didn\u2019t last season but it did before that. I have always said you need to be on top of your performance against the top sides. They might be having a quiet day, you might get the rub of the green, you might need a decision. They might be a bit more measured now with VAR and you certainly wouldn\u2019t have the decisions go against us. But, when it comes down to it, you have to perform. The top sides are there for a reason, they have good individuals and they are good as a unit, and if you don\u2019t perform you very rarely get anything against anyone in the Premier League. Mauricio Pochettino has spoken about his rivalry between himself and Pep Guardiola, who he will come up against on Saturday evening. It is not a competition between him and myself. Of course, that I try to beat all the managers I\u2019m going to face, I love to be competitive and I love to beat them, like they try to beat me. But football is a collective spot and always in that moment, playing at Espanyol against Barcelona and Tottenham against City, it\u2019s not a personal competition. The only way to see if one is better than the other is to play 1v1 and see what happens. Sky interviewed Andy Lonergan, suddenly the most talked-about goalkeeper in the country, on Wednesday. \u201cAlisson unfortunately got an injury and I got a call, and there\u2019s only one answer you give to a team like this, and obviously I\u2019m here,\u201d he said. \u201cI enjoyed my time at Rochdale, but I\u2019ve played a lot of games in my career and recently it hasn\u2019t gone as I\u2019ve wanted it to. That\u2019s all in the past, and I\u2019m looking for the future. I\u2019ve signed for the season. Happy days, and whatever they need me to do I\u2019ll do.\u201d This doesn\u2019t augur well, although United won on Goram\u2019s debut anyway. Here\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s report on Manchester United 4-2 Coventry in April 2001. Andy Lonergan spent most of last season at Middlesbrough, where he was named on the bench for 10 league games, never used, and left out of the squad for the remainder. He did play seven league games on loan at Rochdale, keeping one clean sheet, and a few times in the cups. In 2017-18 he played seven league games for Leeds, the year before than 10 for Wolves. It has, in short, been a while since he played regularly, and he has never played in the Premier League. Here\u2019s some video of Adri\u00e1n being taken out by a two-footed flying fan-tackle. In addition to all Liverpool\u2019s other goalkeeping troubles, Caoimhin Kelleher needed surgery on a wrist injury last month: The La Liga season starts tonight, with Barcelona\u2019s game against Athletic Club in Bilbao. Here\u2019s Sid Lowe\u2019s season preview: \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt about how much we love our fans,\u201d says Klopp, \u201cbut if they can all stop doing that please. Norwich, Istanbul, people ran on the pitch. It\u2019s not funny. The girl in the Champions League final made money obviously. I like that we don\u2019t have fences in stadiums but that means a lot of responsibility for supporters as well. It\u2019s crazy. How can something like this happen?\u201d That leaves Andy Lonergan, the 35-year-old former Preston netminder, as Liverpool\u2019s only fully fit senior goalkeeper. They also have the 20-year-old Irishman Caoimhin Kelleher. \u201cWe are all completely excited about [him], a young boy with the potential he has,\u201d says Klopp. \u201cHe\u2019s not in 100% training, but nearly 100% for a week and a half. He has to be in training today and then we have to make a decision.\u201d Injury news from Liverpool: Adrian has an ankle injury, which he suffered during the wild post-shoot-out celebrations in Istanbul. \u201cWhen we were all together a supporter jumped over, was chased by some security guards, slipped and kicked his ankle. Crazy. Yesterday it was swollen. Today he says it is much better than yesterday, but we have to see. Apart from that it was a brilliant night for him.\u201d Watford hold their press conferences on Thursdays, but this has just landed from PA Media. I think it\u2019s a bit weird how last week\u2019s defeat to Brighton seems to have been universally ascribed to rogue player underperformance, because I thought there were obvious tactical issues that Javi Gracia made no attempt to deal with, and were at least as important in determining the outcome of the game as anything the players did within his chosen system, and nobody seems to be asking him about those: Watford boss Javi Gracia is expecting a better show from his side when they visit Everton on Saturday. The Hornets\u2019 new campaign got off to a woeful start as they were beaten 3-0 at home to Brighton last week, but Gracia is not hitting the panic button. He wants his side to learn their lesson from last week and be more like themselves at Goodison Park. \u201cIn all of the games we try to learn, win or lose,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this case we had a bad result, it was hard for us, because we were looking forward to the first game of the season and we wanted to start well, it wasn\u2019t possible. We will try and learn from it. We have many things to improve, we will try to do it better. \u201cIt was only the first game and we have another chance on Saturday. I think we can play better because we have done it before and I am sure we will do it.\u201d Despite having Danny Welbeck, Quina, Nathaniel Chalobah and Adam Masina available on Merseyside, Gracia is not going to make wholesale changes. \u201cWhen we finished the game against Brighton I was asked about the players that were out of the team,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not the main solution, the main solution to play better is to try and work during the week, try and improve with all of the players. All of the players will be important in the next games. We try to find the solutions for all of the different games we play.\u201d Andy King has been talking about his move from Leicester to Rangers, and specifically about whether he spoke to Brendan Rodgers about it, which surprisingly he hasn\u2019t, yet: I\u2019ve not really spoken to him about coming here specifically but I will do. A man who was so successful in Scottish football with the titles he won, I will call him and ask him about life in Glasgow, what Scottish football\u2019s like and stuff like that. But I have not really had the chance to do that. I am really grateful for him being clear with me a couple of weeks ago. He said it was up to me to try and find a new challenge and fortunately I have managed to do that - a massive challenge at a massive football club and one I am delighted to be at. Some early Aston Villa v Bournemouth team news: Jonathan Kodjia is out for Villa with the striker nursing an ankle injury. He is expected to be sidelined for around 10 days while Kortney Hause is also missing with his own ankle problem. James Chester remains absent for Dean Smith\u2019s side after picking up a hamstring injury during pre-season. Bournemouth will again be without forward Arnaut Danjuma as the Dutch summer signing continues to be assessed for a foot problem. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is holding his weekly press conference, and has been chatting about Alexis Sanchez: Alexis is such a professional, he comes in working every single day really hard, and he wants to be part of this. It\u2019s these stories again that he\u2019s been put in the reserves - of course he hasn\u2019t. He\u2019s part of our squad and he\u2019s a very, very good player. He\u2019s a few weeks behind the rest but he\u2019s very close to being part of it. We don\u2019t have the biggest forward line in numbers, so Alexis might end up playing a lot more games than you expect. We expect him to come good at this club. He\u2019s quality. Some news from Newcastle, courtesy of PA Media. In brief: Shelvey fine, Saint-Maximin doubtful, Carroll a while off: Newcastle boss Steve Bruce has revealed new signing Allan Saint-Maximin is a doubt for Saturday\u2019s Premier League trip to Norwich. The French summer signing, who was handed a debut as a substitute in last weekend\u2019s 1-0 home defeat by Arsenal, has a hamstring problem and could miss out at Carrow Road, although fellow midfielder Jonjo Shelvey is expected to shake off an ankle injury. Deadline day signing Andy Carroll remains several weeks away from making a second debut for the club, although Bruce is convinced he will have a significant role to play this season. He said: \u201cHe\u2019s doing a bit of running on the grass. We still think he is gong to be at least four, five weeks away. The big thing with Andy is not to put a timescale on him. He\u2019ll be ready and fit when he is, and if you try to put timescales on it it disappoints him and disappoints everybody else. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s going to have a big part to play. The way I\u2019ve seen him running in the week then hopefully - touch wood he stays OK - he\u2019ll be in in the next few weeks.\u201d Also new this morning: a freshly-baked batch of transfer rumours, straight from the oven: Here are 10 things to look out for in the Premier League this weekend: Hello world! It\u2019s Friday, and the weekend is just around the corner, carrying with it a bumper basket full of footballing fun. Here are this weekend\u2019s Premier League fixtures (all times BST): Saturday Arsenal v Burnley (12.30pm) Aston Villa v Bournemouth (3pm) Brighton &amp; Hove Albion v West Ham United (3pm) Everton v Watford (3pm) Manchester City v Tottenham Hotspur (5.30pm) Norwich City v Newcastle United (3pm) Southampton v Liverpool (3pm) Sunday Chelsea v Leicester City (4.30pm) Sheffield United v Crystal Palace (2pm) Monday Wolverhampton Wanderers v Manchester United (8pm) We\u2019ll look ahead to all of those with the usual press-conferential updates, as well as injury news, other news, things that scarcely qualify as news and whatever curveballs the world wants to throw at us.

      "bodyText": "West Midlands police have refused to take up an offer of new powers to make it easier for officers to conduct stop and searches. The force was included in a pilot scheme to lower the level of authorisation needed for such searches, but data shows officers still sought approval from assistant chief constables. Section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act allows officers to search anyone in a designated area without suspicion for a defined period if police anticipate serious violence. On Sunday the home secretary, Priti Patel, announced a nationwide extension of the pilot scheme lowering the authorisation needed for a section 60 from a senior officer to an inspector. David Jamieson, the West Midlands police and crime commissioner, said: \u201cThis shows the government have not looked at one of the major pilot areas, as we didn\u2019t reduce the approval level. \u201cWe didn\u2019t make the changes because we didn\u2019t need to.

      "bodyText": "Update: It takes more than a nasty system outage to hold the Footsie back. Today, anyway. The UK\u2019s blue-chip index has just closed for the day, with solid gains, as traders put this morning\u2019s 100-minute outage behind them. The FTSE 100 gained exactly 50 points, or 0.7%, to finish at 7,117 - a small but welcome improvement on Thursday\u2019s six-month low. Other European markets clambered back off the mat too, with Germany\u2019s DAX up around 1.3% Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says the FTSE came \u201cfashionable late\u201d to the party. Better late than never! The FTSE finally was able to join the market relief rally on Friday after being held at the gate this morning. Working on the hopeful assumption that central banks are going to step in and try and force the global economy into a U-turn away from a recession, the markets were fairly uniform in their gains. There should be red faces at the London stock exchange today, says Fiona Cincotta of City Index. She writes: After a rare delay, trading on the FTSE finally kicked off almost two hours later than usual on Friday. The opening auction started at 09:20 with stocks opening for trading at 09:40, well after the standard 08:00am start in what was the longest glitch since 2011. This is the second glitch in two years, the last one was a year ago saw the FTSE open 1 hour late. There is no hiding from this one, the two-hour delay to open is an embarrassment for LSE and raises plenty of questions over the group\u2019s technology. The timing is pretty horrendous for LSE, just weeks after it sealed a deal to buy Refintiv, in its quest to become a global markets and information powerhouse. LSE\u2019s reputation as one of the most reliable stock exchanges in Europe is starting to be questioned. Unless there\u2019s a strong late rally, Wall Stree will post its third weekly decline in a row. Stocks are down around 1.7% this week, mainly due to Wednesday\u2019s tumble (which wiped 800 points off the Dow). Time for a quick recap A freak software glitch has stuck Britain\u2019s stock market, preventing investors buying and selling stock in the biggest companies listed in London. The London Stock Exchange failed to open at 8am, as expected, with traders left twiddling their thumbs until 9.40am. Once trading finally began, London joined a relief rally sweeping Europe, and pushing stocks up in New York too after a brutal few days. European Central Bank policymaker Olli Rehn cheered investors, by predicting that the ECB would unleash a bold new stimulus programme next month. Hong Kong, though, has fuelled slowdown fears by reporting that its GDP contracted by 0.4% in April-June, worse than first thought. This helped to push more government bonds to record highs, sending borrowing costs lower; the entire Swedish yield curve is now inverted. In other news... The Turkish military pension fund Oyak has entered exclusive talks with the government to buy British Steel, in a rescue that could save more than 4,000 jobs. The boss of Cathay Pacific has resigned, after the airline faced heavy criticism from Beijing over employees\u2019 involvement in the Hong Kong protests. The blackout which struck Britain\u2019s power network last week will be blamed on avoidable faults: The New York Stock Exchange is showing the LSE how it\u2019s done, by opening smartly, and bang on time. Shares are rising at the open, as traders try to put a rough week behind them. The Dow has gained almost 200 points, as the futures market predicted earlier, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq gaining 1%. No-one is immune to the kind of systems failures that hit the London Stock Exchange this morning, of course. Back in 2015, Bloomberg\u2019s systems crashed for several hours - leaving traders unable to operate, and even forcing the UK government to delay a debt auction. The disruption was blamed on an \u201cinternal network error\u201d.... but there was a rumour, alas never confirmed, that an IT worker had accidentally spilt a can of coke on a server. The US stock market is expected to rally when it opens in an hour\u2019s time (unless London\u2019s tech gremlins scamper across the Atlantic and wreck more havoc). The Dow Jones industrial average is up 230 points in the futures market - which would recover a chunk of Wednesday\u2019s 800-point tumble. Traders are citing hopes of a US-China trade war breakthrough, after Donald Trump said he hopes to speak with Xi Jinping soon. But let\u2019s not get carried away; as things stand, America will impose fresh tariffs on Chinese consumer goods next month, meaning Beijing will retaliate. Money is still pouring into the world\u2019s government bond markets today, as asset managers look for a place of safety. Prices are hitting new highs, dragging yields (the rate of return on the debt) to fresh lows. Germany\u2019s 10-year bund yield, for example, just hit minus 0.72% for the first time ever -- meaning investors are prepared to lose money to lend to Berlin for a decade. They\u2019ll be calculating that the European Central Bank\u2019s forthcoming stimulus package will drive bond yields even lower, as the ECB will create new money to buy bonds with. Sweden is also benefitting -- its 20-year bond yield has just tumbled below 0%. That means the entire Swedish bond yield curve is negative (longer-dated debt is yielding less than short-dated bonds). That shows investors are pessimistic about growth prospects, having noticed that Sweden\u2019s economy contracted in the last quarter. Now that London\u2019s stock market is back in business, City investors can return to fretting about the risks of a global downturn. This week\u2019s market turbulence, and the now notorious inversion of the US government bond yield curve, have put traders on edge. Hong Kong\u2019s has now added to the jitters, reporting that its economy shrank by 0.4% in the second quarter of this year. That\u2019s worse than the 0.3% decline first reported. Hong Kong thus joins Germany, the UK and Sweden, which also suffered a contraction in April-June, as the world economy slows. This may also indicate that the pro-democracy protests that gripped the city for months are having a more serious impact on its economy than first thought. With tourism down, and the Hong Kong airport seriously disrupted this week, the region could soon be in recession. Here\u2019s our news story on the gremlins taking control of the London stock market. The LSE won\u2019t say exactly what went wrong this morning, apart that the problem centred on its software. Here\u2019s the official statement: London Stock Exchange experienced a technical software issue this morning that affected trading in certain securities, including FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 stocks. Following resolution of the issue regular trading in all securities commenced at 09.40. That issue scuppered the usual pre-open auction (which helps to set prices before trading gets underway at 8am). AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould says today\u2019s problems have livened up an otherwise dull morning: Investors would have been yearning for a quiet Friday after a week of turmoil for the markets driven by recession fears. \u201cAnd it looked like just such a peaceful interlude was on the cards until technical issues at the London Stock Exchange delayed the start of trading in FTSE 350 stocks, delaying an expected rebound for the index.\u201d Today\u2019s stock market glitch hasn\u2019t affected the pound, which has just jumped to its highest level in eight days. Sterling has gained 0.5% against the US dollar to $1.2141, as the campaign to prevent a no-deal Brexit in October gathers pace. Earlier today the leader of the Liberal Democrats, Jo Swinson, insisted that an emergency government could be installed to prevent Britain crashing out of the EU, and that Conservative grandee Ken Clarke and senior Labour MP Harriet Harman \u2013 the father and mother of the house \u2013 are both willing to lead it. The London Stock Exchange has just revealed that some buy and sell orders that should have expired this morning are still lurking on its trading platform. That may explain why trading was delayed for so long. The LSE says: GTD orders expected to expire this morning have remained in the system. These orders cannot be traded against and are still being advertised via Market Data. This has caused crossed order books. This is being investigated and an update will be provided at 10:30. What, I hear some readers cry, is a GTD order? It stands for \u2018good until date\u2019 -- an instruction to one\u2019s broker to maintain a buy or sell order until a specific time. Then it would expire, unless it had already been executed. Failing to cancel a GTD order as instructed would cause problem -- asset managers might find they\u2019ve bought or sold something they didn\u2019t mean to..... The London stock market seems to be trading normally now, after being stricken for more than an hour and a half. Every sector is higher, with telecoms, financial stocks and healthcare leading the way. But even so, investors didn\u2019t need the drama, following the wild swings in asset prices we saw this week. The BBC\u2019s Victoria Fritz points out that nerves were already frazzled by recession fears. This is more like it! The market has \u201ctransitioned to regular trading\u201d, says the LSE\u2019s status page, as it picks up the pieces following this morning\u2019s debacle. Bad news, City traders, you can\u2019t bunk off to the pub to watch the cricket. The London Stock Exchange has suddenly burst into life, as traders finally get the chance to trade on one of the world\u2019s top stock markets. The FTSE 100 has leapt by 53 points, or 0.75%, to 7121 points, recovering from yesterday\u2019s six-month low (helped by hopes of central bank stimulus measures). Telecoms group BT is the top riser, gaining 3%, followed by insurance group Hiscox (+2.6%) and broadcaster ITV (+2.5%). That\u2019s a relief -- but it still leaves the LSE facing a lot of questions. What went wrong? The Stock Exchange is creaking into life! The FTSE 250 index (which contains mid-sized companies) just rose by 0.01% -- a teensy change, which means something has started trading. Trading is now expected to begin at 9.40am - 100 minutes late. Reuters points out that today\u2019s outage is the longest since February 2011, when the market was shuttered until lunchtime. BREAKING: The London Stock Exchange says an opening auction is underway now. That\u2019s a sign that the unexplained problem might be fixed, and that trading could begin soon. And not before time -- this is already the longest outage in eight years! Today\u2019s technical problems are the third to strike the UK this month alone. Last Wednesday, thousands of passengers at British Airways were stranded after its systems collapsed. Two days later, major power cuts struck the country after the National Grid\u2019s network failed. There\u2019s no suggestion that the three are linked (the power blackout is being blamed on a technical fault at the world\u2019s largest offshore wind farm, Hornsea One). But still, this hat-trick of problems doesn\u2019t reflect well on Britain\u2019s infrastructure. Neil Wilson, analyst at Markets.com, agrees that the outage is frustrating: Still waiting...the FTSE cash equity market has failed to open and remains closed for the time being. The FTSE 350 is closed but AIM trading is still ok. These things happen \u2013 the last delayed start to trading was only a year ago. Technical glitches are inevitable, frustrating as it is for everyone. Wilson also points out that the Footsie SHOULD be rallying, having slumped to a six-month low of 7067 points last night. FTSE futures are trading \u2013 and our fair value estimate suggests the cash market will open up strongly around 7115. Frustration is mounting in the City. London\u2019s stock market has now been frozen for an hour -- leaving traders unable to buy and sell shares in the 350 biggest companies listed on the FTSE. And they\u2019ve still not said what\u2019s gone wrong, or when the problem will be fixed. The London Stock Exchange still hasn\u2019t got its systems working. It has just told traders that the next update will come at 9.15am BST. The technical outage in London is preventing UK stock traders from joining in today\u2019s market rally. As you can see, every other major European stock index is higher this morning - as shares recover some of this week\u2019s heavy losses. Craig Erlam of trading firm OANDA warns that the markets could soon turn volatile again - so the LSE needs to fix its problems, fast: Investors are more relaxed this morning than they\u2019ve been for the rest of the week but it would be naive to expect it to continue. There\u2019s been plenty of whipsaw action this week so to assume today will remain calm may be asking a bit much. The FTSE failed to open on time on Friday due to a potential trading service issue. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t think we can blame Brexit for this one but maybe I\u2019ll be proven wrong. Stock market traders are venting their frustration at the London Stock Market\u2019s IT systems, by posting memes on social media. Nothing is moving on the FTSE 100 this morning, as the LSE scrambles to work out what\u2019s gone wrong. This is the second time in 14 months that London\u2019s stock exchange has suffered problems. In June 2018, the opening of trading was delayed by an hour - a serious embarrassment to the City. That was the first outage in seven years. The LSE says it is \u201ccurrently investigating a potential trading services issue\u201d, which is stopping investors buying and selling shares this morning. There\u2019s a problem at the London stock exchange! Trading has been delayed, due to a \u201cpotential Trading Services issue\u201d. It should have begun at 8am sharp. It\u2019s not clear, yet, what\u2019s gone wrong -- but the glitch appears to be stopping investors from trading in companies on the FTSE 100 index, or on the smaller FTSE 250. More to follow.... The prospect of a new ECB bazooka is acting like catnip to European traders. Germany\u2019s DAX index has jumped 0.4% in early trading, while Paris\u2019s CAC and Milan\u2019s FTSE MIB are both 0.3% higher. Spain\u2019s IBEX is also in the green, as Olli Rehn\u2019s promise of a \u201cstrong\u201d stimulus programme reassures the markets. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After a turbulent few days, calm is returning to the markets today on hopes that central bankers could rescue us from a recession. Investors are calculating that institutions such as the European Central Bank could step up to the plate with new measures to ward off a downturn. Olli Rehn, Finland\u2019s central bank governor, has got everyone excited by promising that the ECB will unveil a wide-ranging stimulus package at next month\u2019s meeting. Rehn, who sits on the ECB\u2019s governing council, hinted that the plan could exceed market expectations, given the scale of the situation. He told the Wall Street Journal: \u201cIt\u2019s important that we come up with a significant and impactful policy package in September. When you\u2019re working with financial markets, it\u2019s often better to overshoot than undershoot, and better to have a very strong package of policy measures than to tinker.\u201d So, faced with a slowing economy and a possible recession in Germany, the ECB is poised to restart its bond-buying stimulus programme and slash interest rates deeper into negative territory in a bid to make banks lend. Rehn suggested we should expect \u201csubstantial and sufficient\u201d bond purchases -- a major topping up of the punch bowl. The WSJ dubs it a \u2018big bazooka\u2019 primed to go off in September. Rehn\u2019s words have helped to calm Asia-Pacific markets. Japan\u2019s Nikkei closed flat, while China\u2019s market gained 0.5%, clawing back some of Thursday\u2019s heavy losses. European markets are expected to rally this morning too, having sunk to six-month lows earlier in the week. Otherwise it looks quiet, beyond new trade data from Europe and a new survey of American consumer confidence -- which may show if people have been spooked by recent market turbulence. The agenda 10am BST: Eurozone trade balance for June (expected to dip to \u20ac18.6bn, from \u20ac20.2bn). 3pm: University of Michigan consumer confidence survey (expected to drop to 97.0, from 98.4)",

      "bodyText": "Ataer Holding, which is on course to buy British Steel, is a subsidiary of Oyak, a Turkish military pension fund set up shortly after the country\u2019s 1960 military coup. With \u00a315bn in assets, Oyak is the largest pension fund in Turkey, presiding over a sprawling empire of investments in everything from car manufacturing to energy and finance. It is also the largest shareholder in the Turkish steelmaker Erdemir. The fund is chaired by a former general in Turkey\u2019s armed forces, the second largest in Nato, while the country\u2019s defence minister attended its latest annual meeting, indicating ties to the country\u2019s autocratic regime. Trade unions are also understood to have made contact with sister organisations in Turkey amid concern about the company\u2019s attitude towards labour rights. Oyak has been at pains to demonstrate the seriousness of its intentions to the UK government, sending representatives to Scunthorpe to see British Steel\u2019s blast furnaces. The former business minister Greg Clark said on Friday that Oyak had also welcomed him at its operations in Turkey. Oyak is understood to have impressed the new government, including the pro-Brexit business secretary, Andrea Leadsom, by talking up the idea that the UK\u2019s exit from the European Union is an opportunity to revive British Steel\u2019s fortunes and double capacity within five years. Its representatives have been less keen to discuss some aspects of Oyak\u2019s past in its native Turkey. The Guardian asked Oyak about its involvement in a corruption scandal in 2012, when a Turkish parliamentary commission accused it of orchestrating land deals that cost the exchequer tens of millions of lire. In a 130-page report, the commission cited several deals, including one in which Oyak allegedly obtained construction permits to build a military barracks on government-owned land but instead built much more lucrative private residential apartments. The commission said deals such as these had helped to swell Oyak\u2019s coffers during the late 1990s at the expense of the Turkish treasury. Oyak, which bid for British Steel via its Ataer Holdin subsidiary, declined to comment. But sources close to the company said it had installed a new management team in 2016, was subject to annual independent audits and exhibited the highest standards of transparency. A Turkish car plant jointly owned by Oyak and the French carmaker Renault has also been the subject of frequent labour disputes, one of which resulted in Britain\u2019s largest trade union, Unite, condemning the \u201ccriminalisation\u201d of workers. Despite being a joint owner, Oyak is understood to have no involvement in labour relations at the plant.",

Three years later it collapsed. In a letter to staff, the British Steel chief executive blamed weak market demand, high raw material prices, the weakness of sterling and uncertainty over the outcome of Brexit discussions.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How much is Brexit to blame?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>It is not the only factor in the crisis but it is very important.

      "bodyText": "The Turkish military pension fund Oyak has entered exclusive talks over a rescue deal for British Steel that could save more than 4,000 jobs, after months of talks with the government. Trade unions and Labour welcomed progress on sale talks but said they were seeking assurances on Oyak\u2019s attitude to labour rights, amid concern about its track record in Turkey. Oyak\u2019s subsidiary, Ataer Holding, will have two months to perform due diligence on British Steel, which collapsed into insolvency in May. A full sale is expected before the end of the year. The Turkish company has yet to reveal the finer details of its plans, but told the government that it wanted to inject \u00a3900m into the Scunthorpe steelworks to more than double its output. The plant is where most of British Steel\u2019s staff work. The business secretary, Andrea Leadsom said: \u201cThis is an important and positive step forward in securing the future of British Steel. \u201cI said that no stone would be left unturned in our efforts to find a suitable buyer for the whole company and we have worked tirelessly to support the official receiver to do that. \u201cI want to thank British Steel\u2019s employees for their continued dedication and hard work throughout, which I saw first-hand when I visited Scunthorpe recently. \u201cThe UK has a long and proud history of steel manufacturing and I am committed to a modern and sustainable future for the industry that is productive and supports a skilled and highly valued workforce.\u201d The official receiver David Chapman, who is handling the sale alongside the accountancy firm EY, said: \u201cI will be looking to conclude this process in the coming weeks, during which time British Steel continues to trade and supply its customers as normal.\u201d On Thursday, the Guardian reported that Oyak was accused of corruption by a Turkish parliamentary commission, and jointly owns a Renault car plant where striking workers were allegedly mistreated. Oyak declined to comment but said it had high standards of transparency and has no involvement in management of the car plant. Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, has been accused of being an autocratic leader intolerant of dissent. The country has Nato\u2019s second largest armed forces, whose retirement income is Oyak manages. The fund is chaired by a former army general. In the UK, the shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, said: \u201cGiven the company\u2019s track record, Labour will hold the government to account if there are any moves to undermine the unions and workers\u2019 terms and conditions.\u201d Rachel Reeves, a fellow Labour MP who chairs the business select committee, said she would ask Ataer to explain its \u201cplans for the workforce\u201d as part of an inquiry into the future of the UK steel industry. A spokesman for Unite said it was talking to its sister unions in Turkey and would be \u201cscrutinising the labour and human rights records of Oyak operations carefully.\u201d Roy Rickhuss, the general secretary of steelworkers\u2019 union Community, said: \u201cThe high-quality jobs of the existing workforce must be secured to support the 25,000 families in north Lincolnshire and the north-east that depend on British Steel for their livelihoods.\u201d Ataer was widely expected to be the preferred bidder after promising to keep British Steel\u2019s operations together, rather than seeking to cherrypick the best assets. The government also committed to providing a \u00a3300m support package of grants, indemnities and loans in an efforts to push through the deal. Oyak, based in the Turkish capital, Ankara, is thought to be paying paid \u00a370m for British Steel. The \u00a315bn pension fund staved off competition from Liberty House, the UK-based conglomerate run by the Indian-born businessman Sanjeev Gupta. Greybull Capital, the private equity owner of British Steel when it collapsed, was also interested in buying back parts of the business. Toker \u00d6zcan, Oyak\u2019s head of mining and metallurgy, said: \u201cThe acquisition of British Steel under the Ataer umbrella is the first step in the future plans of our group. Our priority will be to increase the production capacity and to invest in clean steel production in British Steel.\u201d In a statement on its website, Oyak described the potential deal as \u201cone of the biggest achievements of the Turkish steel industry\u201d.",

Beside Grigorian\u2019s luminosity, the other leads somewhat paled in comparison. As Onegin, G\u00fcnter Papendell overdid the haughty ennui in the opening acts, although he was far more engaging as the impassioned lover of the final scene. Oleksiy Palchykov is a sweet-toned, although somewhat underpowered Lensky. There are fine performances in the smaller roles, particularly Dmitry Ivashchenko as a youthful, lyrical Gremin and Margarita Nekrasova\u2019s dark-toned Filippyevna, with solid support from conductor Ain\u0101rs Rubi\u0137is and the orchestra of Komische Oper Berlin. At Festival theatre, Edinburgh, until 17 August. Read all our Edinburgh festival reviews.",

      "bodyText": "I am not sure whether I was amused or saddened to read of Ugo Monye\u2019s \u201cpride\u201d in the selection of an ethnically diverse England rugby union squad (Britain sees rugby as a white, middle-class sport. This squad can change that for good, 15 August), but it very much reinforced my pride in being firmly of the other code. Growing up watching rugby league from the late 1950s, seeing black and mixed-race players in both domestic and international matches was genuinely nothing unusual. Cec Thompson, whose father came from Trinidad, played for Great Britain as far back as 1951, and over the years I have had the privilege of seeing the likes of Billy Boston, Johnny Freeman, Colin Dixon, Henderson Gill, Des Drummond and many more representing the country, including, of course, Ellery Hanley. It is encouraging to see union slowly catching up with league in this respect, but the fundamentally different values traditionally underpinning league, with inclusivity at the sport\u2019s core from the very start, means that, as with professionalism, it could take a century before there is any real change. David Hinchliffe Holmfirth, West Yorkshire \u2022 The heading \u201cBritain sees rugby as a white, middle-class sport\u201d should include the word \u201cunion\u201d. Rugby league, which as a spectator sport at least is far more popular in the north of England than rugby union, has never been a middle-class sport. Even international rugby league players used to have other jobs. Ernest Ward, captain of both Bradford Northern and England rugby league teams in the years after the war, had to work as a bricklayer\u2019s labourer. Rugby union, on the other hand, was seen then, as now, as middle class and was defined disparagingly by the league supporters on the terraces as \u201cwhere they say sorry when they kick you\u201d.

Perhaps you\u2019ve long thought that your core business is so far away from the world of tech that there\u2019s little point in upgrading your system. Equally, it may be that a lack of confidence in the digital skills base of your people, or possibly even your own, has held you back.</p> <p>But the truth is that there are few processes these days that cannot be made easier by currently available business tech \u2013 which is now more accessible and affordable than ever \u2013 freeing up time to concentrate on your core business and removing previous barriers to entry in relation to higher-level digital skills.</p> <p>Today the emphasis is on simplicity and connectivity \u2013 touch-screen smartphones and tablets with simple apps enable people to do their jobs more easily and effectively. So, investigating how mobile solutions could help is a great place to begin for SMEs. Service providers now offer a range of devices that can be tailored to your needs, including flexible tariffs suitable for your budget and setup, no matter how large or small your business is.</p> <p>With little capital outlay, SMEs can eliminate much of the administrative drudgery we all dread, improve communication with colleagues and customers, boost productivity and gain the ability to adapt quickly to market changes. All your productivity software \u2013 such as word processing, spreadsheets, databases and email \u2013 can be accessed directly through the cloud. A simple subscription to Microsoft Office 365, for example, is a good starting point; it will give you and your people access to all the applications and files needed, wherever they are \u2013 and whatever device they\u2019re using. You can even add it to a package from a network provider such as O2, so you don\u2019t have the hassle of managing multiple tech suppliers.</p> <h2>Digital dabblers: take back control</h2> <p>Most SMEs are switched on to the benefits of new technology, but aren\u2019t using it to its full potential. As you\u2019ve grown, you\u2019ve probably adopted systems and services piecemeal, according to short-term business needs.</p> <p>You maybe have applications with overlapping functionality, newer technologies that can\u2019t talk to older systems, or a mixture of fixed, wireless and mobile networks that aren\u2019t sufficiently reliable, robust or integrated.

With smart connectivity knitting together all the people and information in your organisation, you can open up new opportunities \u2013 such as giving your employees the ability to work on any device whether they\u2019re in the workplace, at home or on the move. App stores can give your business and your staff easy, on-demand access to a dizzying array of tools for everything from collaborative working and job scheduling to information management and connecting legacy systems.</p> <p>But while the initial temptation might be to act like a kid in a sweet shop, you need to think strategically to find systems and services that fit together most effectively for you. Work with a technology and connectivity provider that gets how people want to work and can help you strike a balance between giving them the right tools and assuring you maintain control and resilience. For example, a provider such as O2 can link your voice, video conferencing and instant messaging together to simplify its management and give you guaranteed levels of service.</p> <h2>Tech trailblazers: onward and upward</h2> <p>If you\u2019re one of the small but growing band of trailblazing, tech-savvy SMEs, you don\u2019t need to be told how to suck eggs.

National unity governments are merely the latest act, and if we do crash out without a deal, it won\u2019t just be leavers who have questions to answer about how they spent the time since the referendum, and most particularly since the 2017 general election. There\u2019s that slightly questionable statistic that claims that if Donald Trump had simply invested his inheritance in a tracker fund, he\u2019d be richer than he is today. I wonder if all the big hitters and strategists for remain had simply said and done nothing for the past three years \u2013 at all, in any TV studio, or in any Westminster back room \u2013 we would actually be in a better place than we are now. Let\u2019s face it: Boris Johnson is prime minister, we are likely to crash out of the EU without a deal, and even the Lib Dems are refusing to come out of their trailer. How could it have gone worse? \u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist",

      "body": "<p>Tim Edwards* is an English teacher in a secondary school in a relatively deprived part of east London. He\u2019s passionate about his subject, but is watching it die in front of his eyes. He\u2019s losing students left, right and centre as they opt for the sciences or maths, and it\u2019s hard to convince their parents of the value of studying Philip Larkin, Chaucer and and Tennessee Williams in the current climate.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/alevels\">A-level</a> results day on Thursday confirmed an alarming trend: that the study of English is in serious decline. Entries for English language plummeted by 22%, while almost 3,500 fewer students sat English literature this year compared to last. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/aug/15/female-students-outnumber-males-in-a-level-science-entries\">Young women who once favoured English A-level are increasingly ditching it and now outnumber their male peers in the sciences</a>. There has however been no traffic in the opposite direction, as young men continue to eschew English in favour of maths, physics and economics.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m worried for the future,\u201d said Edwards, who is in his fourth year of teaching. The key factor, he thinks, is the government drive to steer young people away from the arts and humanities to study science, technology, engineering and maths \u2013 the so-called Stem subjects, which have become the holy grail of 21st-century education in England.</p> <p>\u201cRecruiting for A-level this year, a lot of the trouble I ran into was that students don\u2019t really see the value of studying English literature at A-level,\u201d said Edwards. \u201cWe had an A-level open day where we did taster lessons. I ran the taster session for English and it was quite popular. However, a lot of the students in there were undecided about it. And the perception I get is that there\u2019s a large push towards the Stem subjects because there\u2019s a feeling these will guarantee students jobs in the future.\u201d</p> <p>Parents, he says, play a large part in their child\u2019s decision making. \u201cI know there\u2019s a large push from parents away from what are seen as safe, easy subjects \u2013 though English A-level is anything but. And I feel sorry. A lot of the time they\u2019re looking too many steps ahead. There\u2019s a relentless focus on doing a subject because it will get you a job. It takes away the enjoyment of studying.\u201d</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/aug/14/english-a-level-tell-us-whats-driving-the-drop-in-take-up-of-the-subject\">Guardian call-out</a> for contributions from students, their parents and English teachers confirmed the pre-eminence of Stem subjects for young people and their families, at the expense of English and other arts subjects, but also linked it to worries about the high cost of going to university with fees at \u00a39,250 a year, plus living expenses.</p> <p>Charlotte Robinson, a deputy head of English at a south London state school, said: \u201cIn these times of austerity, students are being constantly bombarded with the notion that if they are going to go to university and spend \u00a39,000 annually on a degree, they need to study something which is going to make them money.

      "bodyText": "Tim Edwards* is an English teacher in a secondary school in a relatively deprived part of east London. He\u2019s passionate about his subject, but is watching it die in front of his eyes. He\u2019s losing students left, right and centre as they opt for the sciences or maths, and it\u2019s hard to convince their parents of the value of studying Philip Larkin, Chaucer and and Tennessee Williams in the current climate. A-level results day on Thursday confirmed an alarming trend: that the study of English is in serious decline. Entries for English language plummeted by 22%, while almost 3,500 fewer students sat English literature this year compared to last. Young women who once favoured English A-level are increasingly ditching it and now outnumber their male peers in the sciences. There has however been no traffic in the opposite direction, as young men continue to eschew English in favour of maths, physics and economics. \u201cI\u2019m worried for the future,\u201d said Edwards, who is in his fourth year of teaching. The key factor, he thinks, is the government drive to steer young people away from the arts and humanities to study science, technology, engineering and maths \u2013 the so-called Stem subjects, which have become the holy grail of 21st-century education in England. \u201cRecruiting for A-level this year, a lot of the trouble I ran into was that students don\u2019t really see the value of studying English literature at A-level,\u201d said Edwards. \u201cWe had an A-level open day where we did taster lessons. I ran the taster session for English and it was quite popular. However, a lot of the students in there were undecided about it. And the perception I get is that there\u2019s a large push towards the Stem subjects because there\u2019s a feeling these will guarantee students jobs in the future.\u201d Parents, he says, play a large part in their child\u2019s decision making. \u201cI know there\u2019s a large push from parents away from what are seen as safe, easy subjects \u2013 though English A-level is anything but. And I feel sorry. A lot of the time they\u2019re looking too many steps ahead. There\u2019s a relentless focus on doing a subject because it will get you a job. It takes away the enjoyment of studying.\u201d A Guardian call-out for contributions from students, their parents and English teachers confirmed the pre-eminence of Stem subjects for young people and their families, at the expense of English and other arts subjects, but also linked it to worries about the high cost of going to university with fees at \u00a39,250 a year, plus living expenses. Charlotte Robinson, a deputy head of English at a south London state school, said: \u201cIn these times of austerity, students are being constantly bombarded with the notion that if they are going to go to university and spend \u00a39,000 annually on a degree, they need to study something which is going to make them money. The rhetoric is that English is indulgent and arty but not something that can support you financially, in comparison to a subject like maths or economics.\u201d One student now studying English at Anglia Ruskin University said: \u201cMy school frequently held assemblies on how wonderful Stem was and what fields you could go into, but I rarely heard anything about any creative subjects, especially English. There were so many opportunities for Stem students \u2013 trips, after-school clubs, extra help \u2026 nothing like this existed for English.\u201d Others said the shift from studying four subjects at AS-level back to just three A-levels over two years at sixth form had also had an impact. Many students chose English as their fourth subject, then ended up taking it at A-level because it was so rewarding, but that option has now gone. The high-stakes nature of exams has also reduced the popularity of English because of concerns about inconsistent marking in essay-based exams.

      "bodyText": "A leading figure in Philip Hammond\u2019s constituency Tory association has backed the former chancellor after it emerged he is facing a backlash from local members following his attempts to thwart a no-deal Brexit. There is said to be growing anger brewing over his position among pro-Brexit members of the MP\u2019s Conservative association in his Runnymede and Weybridge constituency in Surrey. Hammond \u2013 who quit the cabinet before Boris Johnson became prime minister and has become leading opponent of no-deal Brexit \u2013 could reportedly even face a confidence vote. But June Seager, an influential member of the association\u2019s executive committee who has previously served as its chair and president, said she was firmly behind Hammond. Party rules dictate that an attempt to bring a confidence motion against Hammond would require 50 signatures from association members, but Seager said that was unlikely. \u201cGenerally speaking, there\u2019s a lot of support for Philip.

You can promise yourself that you won\u2019t buy a new outfit, but you\u2019ll either spend the cost of an Asos spree on getting your old one dry cleaned, or you\u2019ll worry about looking shabby and spend approximately \u00a310,000 on pashminas and fascinators at Euston Accessorize, as though you\u2019re literally planning to party like it\u2019s 1999.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f9db4fb1f0c58b86c8f2b22e9257e95b1c865ed9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9db4fb1f0c58b86c8f2b22e9257e95b1c865ed9/0_306_5400_3240/1000.jpg\" alt=\"UK train\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Even if you\u2019ve managed to get your hands on a millennial railcard, the journey to and from the wedding can leave you completely out of pocket.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Last year <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/millennials-pay-less-than-expected-careers-office-national-statistics-a8557946.html\" title=\"\">the average salary</a> of a 30-year-old was \u00a323,700. We <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-46072509\" title=\"\">typically spend</a> a third of our take-home pay on rent (41% for Londoners). Do the maths. On a millennial budget, two nights in a Travelodge in peak season starts to seem as ludicrous and unattainable as a fortnight in Mauritius. If you have more than one friend getting married in any given year, you\u2019ll have to make some difficult choices. Which event do you attend? Which organ do you sell first?</p> <p>It\u2019s a lazy conclusion to draw, but I blame Instagram. Wedding guests increasingly treat the occasion as an opportunity for a personal photo shoot. Many of us have to treat weddings like holidays because we can only afford one or the other (I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s a wedding photo equivalent of <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/hotdoglegs/?hl=en\" title=\"\">#hotdoglegs</a>, but I assume it\u2019s a mirror selfie taken in a B&amp;B, carefully cropped in order to remove the reflection of a vintage Corby trouser press.)</p> <p>The trouble is that the bar has been raised to an unreachable height. Once upon a time we would have turned up on the Megabus, in a sixth-form prom dress, danced to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2009/mar/21/agadoo-black-lace\" title=\"\">Agadoo</a> with someone\u2019s inappropriate uncle and then passed out in a Portaloo \u2013 an experience that cost about \u00a320. Now we have to worry about what to wear to the post-wedding Friends and Family Boat Brunch and find a gift that is a) meaningful b) aesthetically perfect and c) demonstrably not from Debenhams. It\u2019s easy for other generations to tell us to simply resist the pressure of the wedding industrial complex, but most of the time it\u2019s easier for us to just not go.</p> <p>Ten years ago, I was invited to be a bridesmaid at a wedding in the US. The bride was the first of my peers to get married, and I accepted in the spirit of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/shortcuts/2016/jan/18/fomo-five-more-feelings-angst-social-media-acronyms\" title=\"\">yolo and fomo</a>, before the expressions had been coined. Magical, romantic memories, I reasoned, were worth any amount of credit card debt. I finished paying for that wedding two years after the couple got divorced. I learned a valuable lesson. There is nothing magical or romantic about lying awake at 3am wondering which of your possessions to sell first.</p> <p>Money is constantly cited as one of the <a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/articles/165111-the-10-most-common-things-couples-fight-about-according-to-a-sex-therapist\" title=\"\">most common sources of conflict</a> within a romantic relationship. If a couple can\u2019t maintain a friendship with someone who is making an effort to live within their means, it does not augur well for their relationship. If your friends pressure you into spending more than you can afford in order to attend their wedding, you might find yourself, like me, with a debt that outlasts the marriage. If your friend decides that they can\u2019t afford to come to your celebration, respect their decision and acknowledge that they have given you some priceless life advice. True love might be a once-in-a-lifetime experience, but Visa bills come every single month.</p> <p>\u2022 Daisy Buchanan is author of The Sisterhood \u2013 A Love Letter to the Women Who Shaped Me</p>",

You can promise yourself that you won\u2019t buy a new outfit, but you\u2019ll either spend the cost of an Asos spree on getting your old one dry cleaned, or you\u2019ll worry about looking shabby and spend approximately \u00a310,000 on pashminas and fascinators at Euston Accessorize, as though you\u2019re literally planning to party like it\u2019s 1999. Last year the average salary of a 30-year-old was \u00a323,700. We typically spend a third of our take-home pay on rent (41% for Londoners). Do the maths. On a millennial budget, two nights in a Travelodge in peak season starts to seem as ludicrous and unattainable as a fortnight in Mauritius. If you have more than one friend getting married in any given year, you\u2019ll have to make some difficult choices. Which event do you attend? Which organ do you sell first? It\u2019s a lazy conclusion to draw, but I blame Instagram. Wedding guests increasingly treat the occasion as an opportunity for a personal photo shoot. Many of us have to treat weddings like holidays because we can only afford one or the other (I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s a wedding photo equivalent of #hotdoglegs, but I assume it\u2019s a mirror selfie taken in a B&amp;B, carefully cropped in order to remove the reflection of a vintage Corby trouser press.) The trouble is that the bar has been raised to an unreachable height. Once upon a time we would have turned up on the Megabus, in a sixth-form prom dress, danced to Agadoo with someone\u2019s inappropriate uncle and then passed out in a Portaloo \u2013 an experience that cost about \u00a320. Now we have to worry about what to wear to the post-wedding Friends and Family Boat Brunch and find a gift that is a) meaningful b) aesthetically perfect and c) demonstrably not from Debenhams. It\u2019s easy for other generations to tell us to simply resist the pressure of the wedding industrial complex, but most of the time it\u2019s easier for us to just not go. Ten years ago, I was invited to be a bridesmaid at a wedding in the US. The bride was the first of my peers to get married, and I accepted in the spirit of yolo and fomo, before the expressions had been coined. Magical, romantic memories, I reasoned, were worth any amount of credit card debt. I finished paying for that wedding two years after the couple got divorced. I learned a valuable lesson. There is nothing magical or romantic about lying awake at 3am wondering which of your possessions to sell first. Money is constantly cited as one of the most common sources of conflict within a romantic relationship. If a couple can\u2019t maintain a friendship with someone who is making an effort to live within their means, it does not augur well for their relationship. If your friends pressure you into spending more than you can afford in order to attend their wedding, you might find yourself, like me, with a debt that outlasts the marriage. If your friend decides that they can\u2019t afford to come to your celebration, respect their decision and acknowledge that they have given you some priceless life advice. True love might be a once-in-a-lifetime experience, but Visa bills come every single month. \u2022 Daisy Buchanan is author of The Sisterhood \u2013 A Love Letter to the Women Who Shaped Me",

Here, though, it was the simple fact that it was no longer in the future: once the Caribbean scuba-diving holiday is happening, or the promotion has been achieved, previously seething onlookers largely stop caring (and, presumably, move on to envying whoever\u2019s due for a holiday next month).</p> <p>Which seems odd: isn\u2019t the whole point of envy that you want what others have, rather than what they\u2019ll later have? But there\u2019s a broader psychological truth revealed here, which is that the future is often more tormenting than the past, just because it\u2019s open-ended. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/24/your-money/avoid-worrying-about-a-future-that-may-never-happen.html\" title=\"\">That\u2019s most obvious in the case of worry</a>: worrisome future events are rarely quite so anxiety-inducing once they\u2019re unfolding, and nobody worries about them once they\u2019ve happened.

(I said perhaps.)</p> <p>It\u2019s striking, actually, how often in life the problem isn\u2019t the problem, but a lack of clarity about it \u2013 a lack of hard edges that prevents you from ever quite seizing hold of it. That\u2019s why it feels liberating, in the midst of overwhelm, to make a list, even before you\u2019ve completed a single item on it. It\u2019s also the rationale behind the saying that you regret the things you don\u2019t do more than those you do: you can reconcile yourself to bad exes, or foolish career moves, but not to the loss of the endlessly proliferating parallel lives you might have lived if you\u2019d seized more opportunities.

In real life, of course, that\u2019s partly because the experience turns out to be rubbish. Here, though, it was the simple fact that it was no longer in the future: once the Caribbean scuba-diving holiday is happening, or the promotion has been achieved, previously seething onlookers largely stop caring (and, presumably, move on to envying whoever\u2019s due for a holiday next month). Which seems odd: isn\u2019t the whole point of envy that you want what others have, rather than what they\u2019ll later have? But there\u2019s a broader psychological truth revealed here, which is that the future is often more tormenting than the past, just because it\u2019s open-ended. That\u2019s most obvious in the case of worry: worrisome future events are rarely quite so anxiety-inducing once they\u2019re unfolding, and nobody worries about them once they\u2019ve happened. It\u2019s the same with envy: the possibility of my friend\u2019s new book becoming an acclaimed bestseller allows my imagination to range freely over every potential enviable outcome, but once the possibility becomes reality \u2013 even if it\u2019s truly spectacular \u2013 it\u2019s finite and concrete. I can get my mind around it, adapt to it, perhaps even take pleasure from it. (I said perhaps.) It\u2019s striking, actually, how often in life the problem isn\u2019t the problem, but a lack of clarity about it \u2013 a lack of hard edges that prevents you from ever quite seizing hold of it. That\u2019s why it feels liberating, in the midst of overwhelm, to make a list, even before you\u2019ve completed a single item on it. It\u2019s also the rationale behind the saying that you regret the things you don\u2019t do more than those you do: you can reconcile yourself to bad exes, or foolish career moves, but not to the loss of the endlessly proliferating parallel lives you might have lived if you\u2019d seized more opportunities. It\u2019s why \u201cwriter\u2019s block\u201d is often a matter of not being clear about what you want to say, rather than some mysterious difficulty in saying it. It\u2019s also why virtually every personal finance guru recommends, as a first step, getting a clear picture of your income and expenses, assets and debts, even if this requires getting over an initial hump of fear \u2013 because you can deal with any real situation more effectively than one in which you\u2019ve no idea what you\u2019re going to be dealing with. All of which suggests a useful question to ask when confronting any stressful problem: are you sure you know what the problem is, or is some of that stress the result of an inner flinch, a psychological recoil from facing the truth? Because no matter how terrible reality is \u2013 and this might be worth bearing in mind as you follow the news headlines in the coming months and years \u2013 it can\u2019t, by definition, be as infinitely bad as you were fearing. Read this Julien Smith\u2019s short book The Flinch is a helpful guide to pushing past the instinctive fears that get in the way of doing what matters. oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com",

Peter Duncan, 52, sustained a fatal chest wound after becoming involved in what police described as a chance encounter. Northumbria police arrested seven boys aged 14 to 17 on suspicion of murder. Four of them, two aged 15 and two aged 17, have been released with no further action taken, and the 14-year-old has been released under investigation. Two 17-year-olds remained in custody and a 15-year-old has now been arrested in relation to the incident. The teenagers were arrested after the fight in front of shoppers in Eldon Square mall at 6.20pm on Wednesday. Duncan, a lawyer for the maritime services company Royal IHC, was taken to Royal Victoria hospital where he later died. On Friday Duncan\u2019s family paid tribute to a man who was \u201cloved by all who knew him\u201d. They said: \u201cPeter was a kind and caring man who was always first to help others.

Israel said it decided to block the two freshmen politicians for their support of the boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement. To outcry from rights groups who say it tramples free speech, Israel\u2019s parliament, the Knesset, passed a law in 2017 allowing the government to deport people who support a boycott of Israel or Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank. It has since used the law against critics, activists and human rights groups.

The BDS movement seeks to end the Israeli occupation in the Palestinian territories and discrimination against Palestinian citizens of Israel, who account for almost a fifth of the population. It also demands that Israel allow several million Palestinian refugees and their families to return to their homes. Israel argues the movement is antisemitic and seeks to dismantle Israel as a Jewish state by reducing its Jewish majority. While BDS has gathered some high-profile international support, its comprehensive boycott tactics that include academic and cultural isolation have alienated some who support Palestinian rights but also want engagement with Israel and Israelis.

This was before Donald Trump got elected, but there was already unease about the rise of China as a global superpower.

For the first 20 minutes, American Factory is a light-hearted culture-clash comedy. Workers newly arrived from China sit down for cultural orientation classes. \u201cWelcome to America where you can let your individuality shine,\u201d they\u2019re told. \u201cYou can even joke about the president.\u201d A Chinese worker good-naturedly makes fun of his American co-workers. \u201cThey\u2019re pretty slow, they have fat fingers.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d347504e862d8eccbead920cb9a570e84e02b3bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d347504e862d8eccbead920cb9a570e84e02b3bb/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018There were frustrations and anger by the end\u2019 \u2026 film-makers Julia Reichert and Steven Bognar, who live near the reopened plant.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018There were frustrations and anger by the end\u2019 \u2026 film-makers Julia Reichert and Steven Bognar, who live near the reopened plant.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bognar says everyone laughed a lot in the early days. \u201cThe fumbling of two cultures trying to get to know each other was charming.

      "bodyText": "At the end of 2014, a Chinese billionaire named Cao Dewang bought the General Motors factory in Dayton, Ohio. His plan was to turn the closed plant into the US outlet of Fuyao, his global windscreen and automobile glass empire. This would involve bringing staff over from China to work side by side on the factory floor with their American counterparts, training them and creating around 2,000 jobs. \u201cWe read it in the newspapers!\u201d says Julia Reichert, mimicking the optimism the town felt. \u201cThe plant\u2019s going to reopen! Somebody bought it. We\u2019re manufacturing again. Wow!\u201d Six years earlier, Reichert and her husband, Steven Bognar, filmed the last car rolling off the production line at GM. Their desperately sad Oscar-nominated short The Last Truck: Closing of a GM Plant felt like a 40-minute death knell for the American dream. The couple live just 25 minutes\u2019 drive from the factory and, in the years since its closure, they watched the living standards of former employees plummet. \u201cWe saw them lose houses,\u201d says Bognar. \u201cWe saw them getting jobs at warehouse distribution centres for $8 an hour with no benefits, no healthcare. There were a number of suicides. People said to us, \u2018I\u2019m never going to work in fast food.\u2019 Two years later, they\u2019re working in fast food at 40 years old. These people used to be very proud. They worked hard factory jobs but they made good money.\u201d So when Fuyao arrived in town, Reichert and Bognar switched their cameras back on, little knowing they would be filming at the factory for three years, amassing 1,200 hours of footage. The themes of their fly-on-the-wall documentary American Factory, which is on Netflix from Wednesday, are globalisation and US-China rivalry. But really it is a heart-wrenching story about ordinary people, made with care for their lives and feelings. It\u2019s a low-key film made by low-key directors, but they have suddenly found themselves thrust into the spotlight thanks to their producers \u2013 Barack and Michelle Obama.

Back in Ohio, Reichert and Bognar were fascinated by the idea of a Chinese factory opening in the rustbelt. This was before Donald Trump got elected, but there was already unease about the rise of China as a global superpower. Locally, people wondered how Chinese workers would get along in small-town America. \u201cYou knew something was gonna happen,\u201d says Reichert. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know what.\u201d What did happen, initially, was heart-warming.

Dave Barrie, service manager for Addaction Dundee, welcomed the report as a catalyst for change. \u201cWe need a shift from crisis management to more preventative work. There has to be a sense of urgency from the city\u2019s leadership. Dundee has a real opportunity to use these recommendations positively and implement rapid change.\u201d Barrie said the effect of weekly deaths across the city had taken a devastating toll. \u201cWe need to recognise that these deaths affect the whole community. With every loss the sense of hopelessness builds up. There\u2019s still so much stigma around, and a feeling that some lives are dispensable.\u201d Jenny Marra, Labour MSP for north-east Scotland, who is based in Dundee, called on the Scottish government to collect data on the numbers of problem drug users who were able to access the treatment they needed. \u201cThe fact that there is no inspection process for drugs services is a scandal. All NHS health services should be subject to inspection, not only for patient safety but to ensure that we are providing good services and public money is well spent. The Scottish government needs to rectify this immediately.\u201d",

Security providers who have worked with ultra-wealthy residents of the capital contacted after it was revealed that two Arsenal players faced an \u201congoing security threat\u201d related to an attempted carjacking said that a growing number of violent attacks had made their clientele increasingly wary. Mesut \u00d6zil and Sead Kola\u0161inac were left out of the north London club\u2019s team against Newcastle last week after two men were arrested outside \u00d6zil\u2019s home. That incident followed the attempted carjacking by an armed gang with mopeds when the two men were travelling together. While both players \u2013 now believed to be under 24-hour protection \u2013 are expected to line up on Saturday against Burnley, the episode has lifted the lid on a hitherto little noticed new trend in a city that has long traded on a reputation for being a safe bolthole for the wealthy. In areas like Hampstead Garden Suburb, home to high net worth individuals and a cohort of footballers including \u00d6zil, the security gates are getting higher and private security firms busier amid heightened security concerns, fuelled by a spate of sometimes violent home invasions and vehicle-enabled ram raids. Wealthy visitors to the city are also taking measures. \u201cWe have seen a large increase in requests from our international clients visiting London asking for highly trained drivers with military backgrounds, who can act as both driver and security when required during short stays in the city,\u201d said Samuel Martin, co-founder of 19 London, an international agency providing staff in homes, offices, yachts and private aircraft for high net worth and high-profile individuals.

Painted in a threatening palette of emerald, taupe, sludge brown and abyssal black \u2013 the rare daytime exterior shots swap this for an irradiated glare \u2013 its trademark is a daringly long conversation between Ford and a crazed murderer, built on the tension of their intellectual sparring and the more unsettling possibility that the bad guy might escape his shackles and kill Ford there and then in the cell. Viewers enjoy the sickly thrill of being stalked, even tormented by Fincher\u2019s expert manipulations.</p> <p>When it debuted, Mindhunter sceptics found that, for all the bravura acting and precise direction that had others hailing a masterpiece, the series was as much of a precious prodigy as Ford himself. During <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/12/the-best-tv-shows-2017-no-6-mindhunter\">season one</a>, they argued, it was prone to aggravatingly knowing dialogue \u2013 such as the scenes where the FBI workshop the invention of now-familiar terms such as \u201cserial killer\u201d \u2013 and to allowing those extended two-handers to drag on beyond endurance.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHlJQCyqiaI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PHlJQCyqiaI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHlJQCyqiaI\">Watch the trailer for season two on YouTube</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Series two tackles that criticism by sending its characters further out into the real world. Last year\u2019s loose case-of-the-week format is replaced by an arc dealing with the Atlanta child murders of 1979-81, underpinned by police officers\u2019 frustrated efforts to catch the soi-disant \u201cBTK strangler\u201d. Decamping to Atlanta, a city that has just elected its first black mayor but is riven by racial schisms and reeling from the violent deaths of so many black children, offers a significant shift of tone. Ford is a porcelain nerd with a talent for looking out of place wherever he goes: now he\u2019s really alien. As usual, Groff handles his character\u2019s brittle steel \u2013 Ford is, of course, the most talented member of the team, and willing to take risks the superficially tougher Tench balks at \u2013 with a graceful bottled ferocity.</p> <p>There\u2019s a recalibrating of Ford that includes panic attacks and a consequent popping of Valium, one of several character developments to remind us that Mindhunter isn\u2019t too cool for detective-show tropes. Icy psychotherapist Wendy Carr (Anna Torv) thaws in our eyes as her social life enters the picture, while it\u2019s Tench\u2019s turn to suffer the domestic consequences of the horrors he deals with professionally when a killing close to home spooks his wife Nancy. Stacey Roca (who played Rachel in the UK version of The Office), offers a good line in suburban hysteria leaking out from underneath Nancy\u2019s oversized spectacles and mountainous perm.</p> <p>Ultimately, though, Mindhunter gets out of sleuth-cliche jail through our fascination with the real cases it dramatises: those who have devoured the BTK and Atlanta cases via true-crime podcasts and Wikipedia binges ought to appreciate the lurid creepiness of the former and the elusive oddness of the latter. It\u2019s all a quality guilty thrill.</p>",

Painted in a threatening palette of emerald, taupe, sludge brown and abyssal black \u2013 the rare daytime exterior shots swap this for an irradiated glare \u2013 its trademark is a daringly long conversation between Ford and a crazed murderer, built on the tension of their intellectual sparring and the more unsettling possibility that the bad guy might escape his shackles and kill Ford there and then in the cell. Viewers enjoy the sickly thrill of being stalked, even tormented by Fincher\u2019s expert manipulations. When it debuted, Mindhunter sceptics found that, for all the bravura acting and precise direction that had others hailing a masterpiece, the series was as much of a precious prodigy as Ford himself. During season one, they argued, it was prone to aggravatingly knowing dialogue \u2013 such as the scenes where the FBI workshop the invention of now-familiar terms such as \u201cserial killer\u201d \u2013 and to allowing those extended two-handers to drag on beyond endurance. Series two tackles that criticism by sending its characters further out into the real world. Last year\u2019s loose case-of-the-week format is replaced by an arc dealing with the Atlanta child murders of 1979-81, underpinned by police officers\u2019 frustrated efforts to catch the soi-disant \u201cBTK strangler\u201d. Decamping to Atlanta, a city that has just elected its first black mayor but is riven by racial schisms and reeling from the violent deaths of so many black children, offers a significant shift of tone. Ford is a porcelain nerd with a talent for looking out of place wherever he goes: now he\u2019s really alien. As usual, Groff handles his character\u2019s brittle steel \u2013 Ford is, of course, the most talented member of the team, and willing to take risks the superficially tougher Tench balks at \u2013 with a graceful bottled ferocity. There\u2019s a recalibrating of Ford that includes panic attacks and a consequent popping of Valium, one of several character developments to remind us that Mindhunter isn\u2019t too cool for detective-show tropes. Icy psychotherapist Wendy Carr (Anna Torv) thaws in our eyes as her social life enters the picture, while it\u2019s Tench\u2019s turn to suffer the domestic consequences of the horrors he deals with professionally when a killing close to home spooks his wife Nancy. Stacey Roca (who played Rachel in the UK version of The Office), offers a good line in suburban hysteria leaking out from underneath Nancy\u2019s oversized spectacles and mountainous perm. Ultimately, though, Mindhunter gets out of sleuth-cliche jail through our fascination with the real cases it dramatises: those who have devoured the BTK and Atlanta cases via true-crime podcasts and Wikipedia binges ought to appreciate the lurid creepiness of the former and the elusive oddness of the latter. It\u2019s all a quality guilty thrill.",

But constitutional nonsense, otherwise known as the Fixed-term Parliaments Act \u2013 which is itself another Lib Dem gift to the nation \u2013 is why we\u2019re in this mess in the first place.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/15/jo-swinson-brexit-jeremy-corbyn\">If Jo Swinson is serious about stopping a no-deal Brexit, she must support Corbyn | Jonathan Lis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Labour\u2019s plan has achieved a number of things. Corbyn\u2019s supporters have long been compared to a cult, but the cult-like qualities of his opponents are rarely discussed. We can now see who is primarily motivated by stopping Brexit, and who is mostly driven by stopping Corbyn. In the coming weeks, pressure can be put on MPs as to whether their vendetta against the Labour leader is worth throwing Britain off a no-deal cliff for.</p> <p>It has also put Labour on the front foot over Brexit, underlined by various positive newspaper front-page splashes. Brexit is an instrument of torture for Labour: its leading figures fret about maintaining and extending the coalition of remain and leave voters that deprived the Tories of their majority two years ago, and they differ on strategy going forward. Morale has been poor at the top, partly because of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/31/labour-total-wipeout-boris-johnson\" title=\"\">weak response</a> to Boris Johnson\u2019s ascent to power. There has been some fatalism, too: a sense that Labour can only cut through during party conference or an election campaign. That\u2019s been turned around: a route map for winning back disillusioned remainers from the Lib Dems has appeared \u2013 which is important, given Tory strategist Dominic Cummings is counting on a divided anti-Tory vote to secure a Johnson majority. During an election campaign, Labour will be offering a referendum with remain on the ballot paper, alongside transformative popular domestic policies such as taxing the rich to end austerity, scrapping tuition fees, and public ownership. The Lib Dems will be stuck as a single-issue party, any potential radicalism stymied by the fact that nearly all their target seats can only be won by winning over Tory voters.</p> <p>But Labour still faces multiple challenges. The debate is currently focused on the danger of the Tories <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/04/no-deal-brexit-no-confidence-vote-how-eu-vote-leave\" title=\"\">calling an election for Friday 1 November</a>, hours after a no-deal has happened: a democratic outrage, making an outcome no one voted for in 2016 a fait accompli, whichever party triumphs. But if they break the convention of holding an election on a Thursday, the Tories could call one for 30 October and tell the electorate that voting for them would mean Brexit happening within 24 hours. That would help neutralise the Brexit party threat, complicate Labour\u2019s attempts to avoid any campaign becoming a re-run of the referendum and \u2013 combined with spending commitments \u2013 represent a potent electoral threat.</p> <p>Yet all Labour can realistically do now is attempt to bring down the government, prevent no deal and engineer an election. It will go into that election committed to a referendum with remain as an option. It has already seen how Lib Demmery \u2013 revived purely on the basis of Brexit \u2013 can be driven back. The hope must be that clarity on Brexit will buy the party permission to talk about a domestic agenda popular with a public weary of cuts and market fundamentalism. The party should be brave, offering radical policies that go beyond the 2017 manifesto, picking fights with vested interests as it does so. There are no guarantees about the result, of course. But Labour starts from a stronger position than it did when Theresa May attempted to wipe it out as an electoral force in 2017. Corbyn\u2019s opponents make the mistake of continually underestimating him. They may come to regret it.</p> <p>\u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Her plan to do a backroom deal to put Harriet Harman or Ken Clarke in No 10 smacks not only of establishment stitch-up \u2013 it is also a constitutional nonsense, given it falls to the leader of the opposition, who has twice won a democratic mandate from his party membership and whose party won 40% of the vote just two years ago, to construct an alternative government. But constitutional nonsense, otherwise known as the Fixed-term Parliaments Act \u2013 which is itself another Lib Dem gift to the nation \u2013 is why we\u2019re in this mess in the first place. Labour\u2019s plan has achieved a number of things. Corbyn\u2019s supporters have long been compared to a cult, but the cult-like qualities of his opponents are rarely discussed. We can now see who is primarily motivated by stopping Brexit, and who is mostly driven by stopping Corbyn. In the coming weeks, pressure can be put on MPs as to whether their vendetta against the Labour leader is worth throwing Britain off a no-deal cliff for. It has also put Labour on the front foot over Brexit, underlined by various positive newspaper front-page splashes. Brexit is an instrument of torture for Labour: its leading figures fret about maintaining and extending the coalition of remain and leave voters that deprived the Tories of their majority two years ago, and they differ on strategy going forward. Morale has been poor at the top, partly because of a weak response to Boris Johnson\u2019s ascent to power. There has been some fatalism, too: a sense that Labour can only cut through during party conference or an election campaign. That\u2019s been turned around: a route map for winning back disillusioned remainers from the Lib Dems has appeared \u2013 which is important, given Tory strategist Dominic Cummings is counting on a divided anti-Tory vote to secure a Johnson majority. During an election campaign, Labour will be offering a referendum with remain on the ballot paper, alongside transformative popular domestic policies such as taxing the rich to end austerity, scrapping tuition fees, and public ownership. The Lib Dems will be stuck as a single-issue party, any potential radicalism stymied by the fact that nearly all their target seats can only be won by winning over Tory voters. But Labour still faces multiple challenges. The debate is currently focused on the danger of the Tories calling an election for Friday 1 November, hours after a no-deal has happened: a democratic outrage, making an outcome no one voted for in 2016 a fait accompli, whichever party triumphs. But if they break the convention of holding an election on a Thursday, the Tories could call one for 30 October and tell the electorate that voting for them would mean Brexit happening within 24 hours. That would help neutralise the Brexit party threat, complicate Labour\u2019s attempts to avoid any campaign becoming a re-run of the referendum and \u2013 combined with spending commitments \u2013 represent a potent electoral threat. Yet all Labour can realistically do now is attempt to bring down the government, prevent no deal and engineer an election. It will go into that election committed to a referendum with remain as an option. It has already seen how Lib Demmery \u2013 revived purely on the basis of Brexit \u2013 can be driven back. The hope must be that clarity on Brexit will buy the party permission to talk about a domestic agenda popular with a public weary of cuts and market fundamentalism. The party should be brave, offering radical policies that go beyond the 2017 manifesto, picking fights with vested interests as it does so. There are no guarantees about the result, of course. But Labour starts from a stronger position than it did when Theresa May attempted to wipe it out as an electoral force in 2017. Corbyn\u2019s opponents make the mistake of continually underestimating him. They may come to regret it. \u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist",

But the last such \u201csimple\u201d recession in the English-speaking world was back in the 1980s: in order to have been working age and felt the fear, you\u2019d need to be quite a bit older than most of today\u2019s key policy advisors. The tendency to recruit important economic policymakers from either tenured academics or bankers, neither of whom experience the business cycle in the same way as the rest of the economy, means that direct, gut-level appreciation of how this kind of recession works is even more lacking. For people whose entire recession experience has been driven by finance, the idea that trade and tariffs might be drivers of GDP is an academic understanding. As those clickbait stories might say, \u201conly 80s kids will remember\u201d watching the evening news conclude with a roundup of the lost export orders and factory closures announced that day. Followed by Nationwide and Top of the Pops. It\u2019s going to be worryingly easy for our policymakers to keep looking at financial market stress indicators, repeating slogans about small government and fiscal prudence, and ignoring the world around them. There won\u2019t be any dramatic collapse or moment to shock everyone into action as there was in 2008, and nor will there be any global event to make different governments work together. After a surprisingly long run, we\u2019re going to have to relearn old lessons, probably the hard way. \u2022 Dan Davies is a former Bank of England economist and investment banking analyst",

      "bodyText": "Arsenal have been handed a two-legged tie against Italian Serie A runners up Fiorentina in the Women\u2019s Champions League round of 32 on their return to the competition after a five-and-a-half-year absence. The Gunners are the only British team to have won the competition, in their historic quadruple winning season in 2007. Arsenal secured their Champions League berth by winning the league for the first time in seven years but were unseeded in the draw, meaning they might have been drawn against champions Lyon, and were joined in the draw by runners-up Manchester City. City will play the Swiss team Lugano. Last season, City limped out of round of 32 to Spanish champions Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. It was their third consecutive season in the European competition and their worst performance, having reached the semi final stage on both previous occasions. Emma Hayes\u2019s Chelsea, who reached the semi-final of the competition before exiting 3-2 on aggregate to eventual champions Lyon, did not qualify having finished five points behind Manchester City in the Women\u2019s Super League. Last season\u2019s Champions League runners-up Barcelona were drawn against the Italian champions, and the home of English forward Eni Aluko, Juventus. Six-time winners and holders Lyon, have been drawn against Russian champions Ryazan-VDV, while German champions Wolfsburg will play Kosovo\u2019s Mitrovica. Glasgow City take on Russian side Chertanovo and last season\u2019s Scottish Women\u2019s Premier League runners-up Hibernian have been drawn against Slavia Prague from the Czech Republic. The first legs will take place on 11/12 September, with the return fixtures on 25/26 September. The final will be played in the 17,656 capacity Viola Park in Vienna on 24 May. And here\u2019s the champions\u2019 reaction. Some social media reaction from Arsenal, none as yet from City. The draw in full, and in reverse order to them being pulled out. FC Minsk v FC Zurich. Lugano v Manchester City Pitea v Brondby Mitrovica v Wolfsburg Breidablik v Sparta Prague Anderlecht v BIIK-Kazygurt St. P\u00f6lten v FC Twente IFK Gothenburg v Bayern Munich Arsenal v Fiorentina Ryazan-VDV v Lyon Chertanovo v Glasgow City FC Vllaznia v Fortuna Hj\u00f8rring Sporting Lisbon v Paris Saint-Germain ZFK Spartak v Atl\u00e9tico Madrid Hibernian v SK Slavia Prague Juventus v Barcelona The matches will be played 11/12 &amp; 25/26 September. And that, in the words of Graham Kelly, concludes the draw. The final tie: Belarus\u2019 FC Minsk v FC Zurich. Switzerland\u2019s Lugano v Manchester City. Sweden\u2019s Pitea v Brondby of Denmark. Kosovo\u2019s Mitrovica v Wolfsburg, winners in 2013 and 2014. Iceland\u2019s Breidablik v Sparta Prague. Anderlecht v BIIK-Kazygurt of Kazakhstan. Austria\u2019s St. P\u00f6lten v FC Twente from the Netherlands. Sweden\u2019s IFK Gothenburg v Bayern Munich, last year\u2019s semi-finalists. Arsenal v Fiorentina, trip to Italy for the English champs. Russia\u2019s Ryazan-VDV v Lyon, the six-time champions. Russia\u2019s Chertanovo v Glasgow City FC Albania\u2019s Vllaznia v Fortuna Hj\u00f8rring of Denmark. Sporting Lisbon v Paris Saint-Germain Serbia\u2019s ZFK Spartak v Atl\u00e9tico Madrid Hibernian v SK Slavia Prague. Juventus v Barcelona Juventus, an unseeded team come first, and draw FC Barcelona in a huge fixture. Barca reached last season\u2019s final. Away we go.... Anne Vonnez, the women\u2019s football competition expert, guides us through the process. Making the draw will be Josephine Henning, four-times a winner of this competition, and who finished her career at Arsenal. She won it with FFC Turbine Potsdam, twice with Wolfsburg, and once with Lyon. She also lost in the final with PSG. Now retired and still just 29, what does she do now? She\u2019s an artist with her own studio. The chamber in Nyon is visible as Nadine Kessler, head of women\u2019s football for Uefa takes on the role that used to be Gianni Infantino, back when he was the European governing body\u2019s answer to Henry Kelly before becoming chief suit for Fifa. Rightly, she celebrates the summer\u2019s Women\u2019s World Cup and proclaims the success of last season\u2019s Champions League which was \u201crecord-breaking\u201d in terms of crowds and TV audiences. The challenge, she reminds, is to beat Lyon. Uefa get us underway with some catchy Euro electropop, with a montage of all the clubs in the final 32 and the cities they come from. Any Uefa or Fifa event is a celebration of hands being reached across land and sea. The countdown to the draw has begun... Some further details from Uefa on the tournament. Lyon have won the title four years in a row and six times overall, both records Wolfsburg and Arsenal (ending a five-year absence) are the other former winners involved while Barcelona, Paris and Fortuna are past finalists Br\u00f8ndby are in the knockout rounds for a record 16th time; they, Fortuna and Lyon have featured in all 11 seasons of the round of 32 under this format Pite\u00e5, Lugano and Chertanovo will make their debuts in this round while fellow newcomers Braga came through the qualifying round Albania and Kosovo are represented in the round of 32 for the first time Anderlecht are also making their knockout bow Calendar Round of 32: 11/12 &amp; 25/26 September 2019 Round of 16 draw: 30 September 2019, Nyon Round of 16: 16/17 &amp; 30/31 October 2019 Quarter-final &amp; semi-final draw: 8 November 2019, Nyon Quarter-finals: 24/25 March &amp; 1/2 April 2020 Semi-finals: 25/26 April &amp; 2/3 May 2020 Final (Viola Park, Vienna): 24 May 2020 Here\u2019s a report from last season\u2019s final. Unlike the men\u2019s version of the Champions League, this is a straight knockout and all the better for that. It\u2019s sudden death for everyone involved. Who can stop Lyon? This season represents the chance to emulate the Real Madrid team of 1956 to 1960, who won the old European Cup five years in succession. They will be the team to avoid for the rest; Lyon won May\u2019s final by beating Barcelona 4-1 and at a canter. Arsenal, last season\u2019s Women\u2019s Super League champions, are unseeded and face the possibility of pulling Lyon. Manchester City, who came second in England, are seeded. How does the draw work? From Uefa: The 16 sides with the highest coefficient are seeded and placed in a separate pot to the unseeded teams, with each tie containing one side from each pot No club can meet a team from their own association.

I look forward to joining her in the lobbies to vote this government down.\u201d Swinson was criticised by a number of pro-remain Labour politicians for her stance on Thursday, but her position was backed by two former Lib Dem leaders, who told the Guardian her judgment was correct that Corbyn\u2019s plan would not succeed. Swinson\u2019s predecessor Vince Cable said: \u201cThe Lib Dem view is that no party should be playing self-indulgent games trying to form an alternative government when clearly they don\u2019t have support. It has to be a non-party initiative, led by people who have no ambitions for themselves or their party.\u201d Tim Farron, who led the party into the 2017 election, called Corbyn\u2019s offer \u201ca transparent and disingenuous power grab that clearly wouldn\u2019t work and [would] only play into Johnson\u2019s hands\u201d.",

      "body": "<p><em>Sue Stennett lives with her husband in Lincolnshire. She travels to Manchester whenever she can in search of more information about the Peterloo massacre and why it inspired her great-great-great-grandfather to found the Manchester Guardian \u2013 the name of this paper until 1959</em></p> <h2>When did you first become aware of your links to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/gnmeducationcentre/john-edward-taylor-peterloo-teaching-resource-gnm-archive\">John Edward Taylor</a>?</h2> <p>For my wedding, my aunt gave me a veil, and I was told the story behind it, and how John Edward Taylor\u2019s daughter Sophia had worn it on her wedding day. It was cream, and I chose a dress to match. I was so young at the time, and didn\u2019t really appreciate the significance of its story \u2013 it was only after my father died that my interest was sparked. I found a book in among his things called A Family Biography \u2013 a limited-edition book collated by Catherine and Isabella Scott (Sophie\u2019s nieces and the sisters of the Guardian editor CP Scott).</p> <h2>What do you know about him as a person?</h2> <p>He was a cotton merchant in Manchester and a moderate reformer at a time when change and unrest were sweeping across Europe. He himself was well-to-do but he was hugely engaged with the plight of the working class. It had not been a long time since the French revolution and with ripples of unrest being felt in Britain too, reform was badly needed. There had been protests and riots across the north of England \u2013 such as the 1817 Blanket March, in which a large group planned to march from Manchester to London with blankets to keep them warm, but were quickly dispersed by the authorities. Habeas Corpus had been suspended for a year, and spying, alongside unofficial, underground movements, was rife. John felt passionately that something radical needed to happen to create change.</p> <h2>What was his reaction to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/29/peterloo-britain-kings-queens-mike-leigh-massacre\">Peterloo massacre</a>?</h2> <p>He was radicalised by what he saw at Peterloo. He was at St Peter\u2019s Field on the day of the massacre and interviewed eyewitnesses. He discovered that John Tyas of the Times, the only reporter from a national newspaper at the meeting, had been arrested and imprisoned.

      "bodyText": "Sue Stennett lives with her husband in Lincolnshire. She travels to Manchester whenever she can in search of more information about the Peterloo massacre and why it inspired her great-great-great-grandfather to found the Manchester Guardian \u2013 the name of this paper until 1959 When did you first become aware of your links to John Edward Taylor? For my wedding, my aunt gave me a veil, and I was told the story behind it, and how John Edward Taylor\u2019s daughter Sophia had worn it on her wedding day. It was cream, and I chose a dress to match. I was so young at the time, and didn\u2019t really appreciate the significance of its story \u2013 it was only after my father died that my interest was sparked. I found a book in among his things called A Family Biography \u2013 a limited-edition book collated by Catherine and Isabella Scott (Sophie\u2019s nieces and the sisters of the Guardian editor CP Scott). What do you know about him as a person? He was a cotton merchant in Manchester and a moderate reformer at a time when change and unrest were sweeping across Europe. He himself was well-to-do but he was hugely engaged with the plight of the working class. It had not been a long time since the French revolution and with ripples of unrest being felt in Britain too, reform was badly needed. There had been protests and riots across the north of England \u2013 such as the 1817 Blanket March, in which a large group planned to march from Manchester to London with blankets to keep them warm, but were quickly dispersed by the authorities. Habeas Corpus had been suspended for a year, and spying, alongside unofficial, underground movements, was rife. John felt passionately that something radical needed to happen to create change. What was his reaction to the Peterloo massacre? He was radicalised by what he saw at Peterloo. He was at St Peter\u2019s Field on the day of the massacre and interviewed eyewitnesses. He discovered that John Tyas of the Times, the only reporter from a national newspaper at the meeting, had been arrested and imprisoned. Taylor feared this was an attempt by the government to suppress news of the event and wanted to present the story from the people\u2019s perspective. He was careful to be balanced \u2013 to show that those involved were not all drunk hooligans looking to stir up trouble, but rather a collection of people deeply dissatisfied with the inequality in society who had arrived in the city centre that day in the hope of peaceful protest. He wrote: I affirm, from actual observation, that not the slightest breach of the peace had been committed, or appeared, as far as I can judge, likely to take place\u2026 He went on to collate lists of the injured and wounded \u2013 something that was unrecorded, and had been estimated inaccurately because many were reluctant to seek medical help. He wrote a more detailed account called \u201cNotes and Observations on the papers relative to the internal state of the country\u201d, which went to parliament and contradicted the official record, and was one of the thousands who signed the declaration which asserted the peaceful character of the protest. In the aftermath of the massacre, things began to improve economically and pressure increased for social reform.

Maxwell, 57, the daughter of the late press baron Robert Maxwell, has repeatedly denied allegations of involvement in a sex-trafficking network run by the financier, who was awaiting trial in a New York prison when he died last Saturday.

      "body": "<p>\u201cThey\u2019re marvellous. I just love them.\u201d After nearly 26 years driving a diesel-powered taxi around the streets of Dundee, James Leaburn has switched to an all-electric car, in the bold yellow livery of a classic New York cab.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re quiet, comfortable and the kids just love it because it\u2019s like a New York cab,\u201d said Leaburn as he plugged in at a council-run charging hub. \u201cThere\u2019s no servicing, no broken fanbelts, no oil to change and no flat batteries. Just the press of a button and they\u2019re away.\u201d</p> <p>Dundee, once synonymous with industrial and urban decline, is now at the vanguard of the switch to zero-carbon transport. It already boasts the largest number of electric minicabs anywhere in the UK (134 at the last count), a council-owned network of four solar-powered charging hubs capable of taking 78 cars at a time (with sites for another 60 being built) and the highest number of rapid chargers of any Scottish city. In a few days it will open a rooftop charging hub \u2013 solar-powered, of course \u2013 at a city-centre multistorey.</p> <p>Fraser Crichton, the council\u2019s fleet operations manager, is in charge of the strategy. \u201cMy ambition is to make Dundee fully electric within 15 years, which is my working lifetime,\u201d he said. \u201cI want my city to be the cleanest in the UK.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"552a85084e23d3af9160655467d988872591911d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/552a85084e23d3af9160655467d988872591911d/0_39_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Leaburn admires his electric taxi during a charging stop at the Princes Street charging station.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Leaburn admires his electric taxi during a charging stop at the Princes Street charging station.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeremy Sutton-Hibbert/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Scottish government aims to cut the country\u2019s net carbon emissions to zero by 2045 and end sales of new petrol and diesel cars by 2032. On Thursday the Scottish transport secretary, Michael Matheson, said more than 1,000 public charging points had been installed around the country. Scotland now has the best network of its kind in the UK by head of population \u2013 a claim verified by ZapMap, which charts electric charging points UK-wide.</p> <p>Dundee city council believes it has the UK\u2019s largest local authority electrified fleet, with 117 electric cars and vans in use. It plans to buy 65 more, replacing its highly polluting diesel bin lorries and road sweepers with electric vehicles, and running subsidised electric minibuses in some of its poorest neighbourhoods.</p> <p>Crichton said the impetus for championing electric vehicles was Dundee\u2019s serious problem with air pollution. The city was built in the bowl of an eroded volcano and exhaust gases settle over its centre.

      "bodyText": "\u201cThey\u2019re marvellous. I just love them.\u201d After nearly 26 years driving a diesel-powered taxi around the streets of Dundee, James Leaburn has switched to an all-electric car, in the bold yellow livery of a classic New York cab. \u201cThey\u2019re quiet, comfortable and the kids just love it because it\u2019s like a New York cab,\u201d said Leaburn as he plugged in at a council-run charging hub. \u201cThere\u2019s no servicing, no broken fanbelts, no oil to change and no flat batteries. Just the press of a button and they\u2019re away.\u201d Dundee, once synonymous with industrial and urban decline, is now at the vanguard of the switch to zero-carbon transport. It already boasts the largest number of electric minicabs anywhere in the UK (134 at the last count), a council-owned network of four solar-powered charging hubs capable of taking 78 cars at a time (with sites for another 60 being built) and the highest number of rapid chargers of any Scottish city. In a few days it will open a rooftop charging hub \u2013 solar-powered, of course \u2013 at a city-centre multistorey. Fraser Crichton, the council\u2019s fleet operations manager, is in charge of the strategy. \u201cMy ambition is to make Dundee fully electric within 15 years, which is my working lifetime,\u201d he said. \u201cI want my city to be the cleanest in the UK.\u201d The Scottish government aims to cut the country\u2019s net carbon emissions to zero by 2045 and end sales of new petrol and diesel cars by 2032. On Thursday the Scottish transport secretary, Michael Matheson, said more than 1,000 public charging points had been installed around the country. Scotland now has the best network of its kind in the UK by head of population \u2013 a claim verified by ZapMap, which charts electric charging points UK-wide. Dundee city council believes it has the UK\u2019s largest local authority electrified fleet, with 117 electric cars and vans in use. It plans to buy 65 more, replacing its highly polluting diesel bin lorries and road sweepers with electric vehicles, and running subsidised electric minibuses in some of its poorest neighbourhoods. Crichton said the impetus for championing electric vehicles was Dundee\u2019s serious problem with air pollution. The city was built in the bowl of an eroded volcano and exhaust gases settle over its centre. It has three of the most polluted streets in Scotland. Shortly before Leaburn arrived at the council\u2019s Princes Street charging hub, where cars charge under canopies carrying solar panels, Abdullah Kamer had pulled in for a brief battery top-up. Kamer drives for Zippy, a local takeaway delivery company that operates a fleet of 11 battery-powered, zero-emission BMW i3s. The company\u2019s drivers have a reputation for living up to its name, revelling in the electric car\u2019s sharp acceleration. \u201cIt\u2019s a good runner in the city centre,\u201d Kamer said. \u201cYou can actually enjoy driving it. When I use my diesel car, it\u2019s like driving a tractor.\u201d David Kidd, after finishing a shift at a nearby M&amp;S, was loading a folding bike into the boot of his plug-in hybrid 4x4, a Mitsubishi Outlander, which was charging nearby. He switched after spending a fortune on diesel for a long drive to Cornwall. The Princes Street site was once a petrol station.

      "bodyText": "Liverpool have written to Uefa seeking an explanation as to how a supporter managed to evade security and injure goalkeeper Adri\u00e1n during the Super Cup celebrations in Istanbul. The club\u2019s new keeper is a doubt for Saturday\u2019s Premier League game at Southampton after suffering a swollen ankle when a pitch invader careered into him following his decisive penalty save from Tammy Abraham at Besiktas Park on Wednesday. The supporter also struck Joe Gomez but while the Liverpool defender is fit to play at St Mary\u2019s a late decision will be required on Adri\u00e1n\u2019s fitness. Liverpool have contacted European football\u2019s governing body over the seriousness of the incident and the frequency of pitch invasions in finals hosted by Uefa, who often discipline clubs over identical security breaches. There had been an earlier pitch invasion during the game against Chelsea and in Liverpool\u2019s past two Champions League finals against Real Madrid and Tottenham. J\u00fcrgen Klopp said: \u201cWhen we were all together a supporter jumped on us. He was chased by some security guys, slipped and kicked his ankle. Crazy. Yesterday it was swollen. I saw on the plane that it is not cool. Adri\u00e1n wants to play. I think he can but this is still a serious thing and we have to look at it.\u201d Klopp is already without first-choice keeper Alisson with a calf problem, while third-choice Caoimhin Kelleher has only recently resumed training after a broken wrist. New signing, 35-year-old Andy Lonergan, will make his debut at St Mary\u2019s should Adri\u00e1n be ruled out. The former West Ham keeper received intensive physiotherapy on the flight home from Istanbul on Thursday and said on Friday he was hopeful he could play at Southampton. \u201cToday I feel much better,\u201d he told Liverpoolfc.com. \u201cIt was a strange, weird situation, because we were celebrating between us and one guy jumped from the crowd and started running. I think he slipped in front of us and also the security with him and made me a tackle from the side. I feel mentally ready and I also hope with the treatment of the ankle it\u2019s going to be much better.\u201d Klopp is concerned at the regularity of pitch invasions at his club\u2019s matches. He said: \u201cThere was only Liverpool fans there pretty much, so it probably was one. What can I say? There is no doubt about how much we love our fans but if they could all stop doing that, because that\u2019s the worst example I have heard about. \u201cIt happened against Manchester City in the Community Shield when someone was running on the pitch and against Norwich someone ran on the pitch. \u201cIt\u2019s not funny. The girl in the Champions League final made money off it. I like that we don\u2019t have fences but that means a lot of responsibility for supporters. If one supporter cannot hesitate or stop himself, then supporters around him should do it.\u201d The Liverpool manager said the growing problem of pitch invasions is a problem everyone in authority in football needs to take seriously. Klopp said: \u201cWe have the Adri\u00e1n incident which is serious for us but if you ask anyone involved in football if you find it funny that someone runs on the pitch, pants down, half-naked, no one would say, \u2018Oh yes, that is really nice\u2019. You never know who it is there. \u201cBefore the season at the Premier League meeting they told us not to get involved but we are all human beings and if they get close you do not know the person and for us it is not funny. It is still happening. It looks like it is happening a bit more often.\u201d",

I know that I\u2019m not going to be heckled for what I wear and what I do, which might happen in a regular gay venue. \u201cI had my 21st birthday party in there, but I\u2019m by far the youngest person who goes there. Most of the people are in their 30s to 40s, and there are some in their 50s to 60s. What other gay bar do you get that in? It\u2019s a really nice thing.\u201d Blake, who is also the council\u2019s cabinet member for planning, said London had lost a \u201cstaggering number\u201d of LGBT nightclubs over the past decade, with Tower Hamlets \u201cparticularly badly hit with the loss of 73% of LGBT venues since 2006\u201d. Eleven London boroughs, including Haringey, and Kensington and Chelsea, have lost all their LGBT bars, according to research by University College London. It is the second time Tower Hamlets has made planning rulings to protect an LGBT venue. In 2017 the council ruled that the redevelopment of the Joiners Arms bar on Hackney Road could go ahead only if the new building contained a similar-sized gay bar. Blake said saving the Backstreet was more important than saving a standard gay bar because it served \u201ca particular niche of the community\u201d. \u201cWhen there is a rise in hate crime, we must stand up for those with all backgrounds, and it is important that people can enjoy themselves in a safe space without external judgment.\u201d Homophobic and transphobic hate crimes in England and Wales increased by 144% over five years to 11,600 in 2017-18, Guardian analysis has shown. Tower Hamlets blocked the proposed housing scheme even though the developer, a subsidiary of Galliard Homes, had promised to preserve the Backstreet in the basement of the new tower, and pay \u00a322,500 to move and store the club\u2019s collection of fetish equipment, including boots, whips, rubber and gas masks. Blake said councillors worried that putting the club in the basement of a residential building would have led to its demise. \u201cSo much of my inbox is noise complaints,\u201d she said. \u201cThe reality is noise would have led to its closure.\u201d In the ruling against the development, the planning inspector Julia Gregory said: \u201cI am also not convinced that the nightclub would be well received by parents with young children living above \u2026 or would be considered a benefit by future residents.\u201d Gregory said she was therefore not satisfied that the future of the club was protected. A spokeswoman for Galliard declined to comment. Nigel Whitfield, a Backstreet regular and director of the Breeches and Leather Uniform Fanclub which has led much of the campaigning against the development, said it was \u201cflabbergasting\u201d that Tower Hamlets council had spent so much time listening to club regulars\u2019 concerns. \u201cIt is simply unimaginable that 20 years ago a council officer would write reams of pages in defence of a leather nightclub,\u201d he said.",

It\u2019s like laying down wine, but it\u2019s you who changes and matures until you\u2019re ready to consume your stores.

This week a mother apparently confiscated her daughter\u2019s phone so the teenager started using the family\u2019s smart fridge to tweet. Admittedly it was probably a hoax, but I should be able to book a train ticket online without weeping tears of blood. In the meantime, we are going to walk. Thursday My psyche is soothed. I am reading my first Georgette Heyer. It is called Simon the Coldheart and it is great. It\u2019s not one of her usual products, Regency romances, because I hate a) romance and b) the Regency period (once history has fancy furniture I lose interest). It is one of the handful she wrote set in the middle ages or earlier. Even more restorative was the fact that when I idly scanned my shelves upon finishing it, I found two more of that handful already there, bought years ago and ignored since until need focused my eye. This the great thing about books, and the answer to anyone who looks in bafflement at you for buying hundreds more than you can ever read each year. It\u2019s like laying down wine, but it\u2019s you who changes and matures until you\u2019re ready to consume your stores. And it suggests a deep, unsuspected order to at least your inner universe; in some way or other, whenever I bought Royal Escape and My Lord John, my subconscious knew me better than I knew myself. How profoundly consoling is that? Friday \u201cAustralian farmers jailed for smuggling Danish pig semen in shampoo bottles\u201d \u2026 \u201cAlan Partridge saves Steve Coogan from lengthy driving ban\u201d \u2026 \u201cNew Zealanders warned off eating sexy pavement lichen.\u201d These have all been headlines this week. OK, I thought, clinging to my Heyers like a drowning man to driftwood, it\u2019s fine. Obviously I missed more memos that I thought when I was trying to book those tickets, but I\u2019ll catch up and all will be well. And then I found out that the salmon cannon \u2013 wide rubber hoses through which fish are shot over hydroelectric dams that block their migratory paths so that they can do their spawny salmony business on the other side, a video of which has been doing the rounds on social media \u2013 is real, where I had spent the week assuming that it very much was not. I am taking to my bed with my books and do not intend to stir from it or the middle ages for a very long time. Call me only if things improve.",

What appeared to be a beanbag round was lodged in a set of goggles on the ground in front of her. Her injury, a symbol of what protesters say are increasingly brutal tactics against Hong Kong citizens, has galvanised the protest movement as it enters its 11th week. On Monday, a statement allegedly from the victim\u2019s sister circulating on an online forum said she had spent the night in intensive care receiving emergency surgery to reconstruct her eye, which was ruptured. The bones around her eye socket were also shattered. The statement described the victim as \u201ca girl who loves Hong Kong, who wants to protect her home, defend human rights and fight for freedom\u201d. The sister wrote: \u201cI hope you\u2019ll take this anger with you to the airport today.\u201d Thousands of protesters soon swarmed Hong Kong\u2019s international airport, chanting: \u201cAn eye for an eye!\u201d Many wore bloodied bandages over their right eyes or held their hands over their faces as a symbol of resistance. One of the world\u2019s busiest travel hubs was forced to shut down for two days and protesters took out their anger on two men believed to be spies, tying them up and abusing them. Today, her image is on posters, pamphlets and placards, with blood trickling down her cheek like the visage of a weeping Madonna. Richard Scotford, a journalist who was metres away from the victim at the time, said the shot was fired into a group of people on the street clearly comprised of journalists and first-aid volunteers in high-vis vests. \u201cThis white thing was also what I saw whizz past my face just five minutes before the girl was shot,\u201d he posted on his Facebook page, referring to an image of the \u201cnon-lethal\u201d beanbag round found in her goggles. For some protesters, the image of one of their own disfigured and partially blinded has fed calls for more radical measures, including the idea that Hong Kong should be brought to a point of chaos in order to be rebuilt. \u201cSo many people have been hurt and bled, yet we still talk about reason, peace and non-violence,\u201d one user wrote in response to the statement from the victim\u2019s sister. \u201cDying together is what we need. Let\u2019s take Hong Kong back to zero and those who truly love it will remain.\u201d Her case has also become a flashpoint for mistrust of the police and competing narratives by pro-Beijing media. China\u2019s state-run broadcaster CCTV has alleged the woman was not shot with a police beanbag round but a ball bearing fired by a fellow protester. The police admitted to using beanbag rounds but said they could not definitively say if she had been shot by an officer. They said they had started an investigation into the case, but a statement online allegedly from the woman\u2019s friend called on protesters not to submit videos or evidence to law enforcement.",

      "bodyText": "Riot police have charged hundreds of protesters in Zimbabwe and fired teargas, hours after a court ruled out an attempt by the opposition to overturn a ban on a planned demonstration. As leaders of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), the main opposition party, debated whether to call off the protest on Friday, police armed with batons and whips moved to clear streets in the centre of Harare, the capital. Witnesses reported chaotic scenes, with many protesters beaten, at least three injured and others loaded into armoured vehicles. Police also set up a series of checkpoints to stop MDC supporters reaching the centre of Harare and blocked off the headquarters of the MDC. \u201cPeople were peaceful and marched with order. They know that we always sing during demonstrations. Why are they beating us? Is this the democracy that they always talk about? They are the ones who are violent,\u201d Mike Nyashanu, an unemployed 27-year-old who was being treated by paramedics for a suspected broken arm, told the Guardian. The government had moved to block the demonstration with a prohibition order imposed late on Thursday. A high court judge refused to overturn the ban in an early morning hearing. A spokesperson for Nelson Chamisa, the leader of the MDC, said the planned protest had not been called off, despite the court decision. Other protests are planned around Zimbabwe in coming days. \u201cThe government has come out in full force. The legal decision [upholding the ban] is unconstitutional \u2026 [Chamisa] is concerned about loss of life but he believes the country will have to move forward,\u201d Dr Nkululeko Sibanda said. The protests come more than 18 months since Emmerson Mnangagwa took power after a military takeover ousted the veteran ruler Robert Mugabe in November 2017. Mnangagwa then went on to win a closely fought and contested election promising investment, transparency and \u201cgood days ahead\u201d for the former British colony. There are widespread fears that any unrest will prompt a brutal crackdown. In August last year six people were killed by troops deployed to clear the centre of Harare after an opposition rally against alleged vote rigging. In January, 13 died and hundreds were raped or beaten as security forces quelled unrest following a hike in fuel prices. A statement from the Ministry of Information said officials were aware of \u201can incident where an unidentified woman was injured during \u2026 when the police tried to disperse an illegal demonstration\u201d. \u201cThe woman was taken to hospital and efforts are under way to establish her condition,\u201d it said. Six anti-government activists were abducted and tortured earlier this week, according to human rights groups. The activists were taken from their homes at night by armed men in unmarked cars, accused of involvement in the protests, stripped, beaten and then abandoned. Amnesty International criticised \u201can escalating crackdown against human rights defenders, activists, civil society leaders and members of the opposition, including abductions and torture\u201d. Mnangagwa\u2019s ruling Zanu-PF party, which holds a majority in parliament, has pushed through new security legislation which the opposition and human rights activists describe as very harsh. The new laws will disappoint observers who hoped that authorities would reform, not simply replace, repressive laws dating back to Mugabe\u2019s rule. European and US officials are hoping that political reforms will accompany efforts to refloat Zimbabwe\u2019s economy. On Thursday, the president urged the opposition to engage in dialogue. \u201cOur strongest asset is our unity. I reiterate my calls to all opposition leaders that my door remains open [and] my arms remain outstretched. Riots [and] destructive violence must be rejected; peaceful constructive dialogue are the way forward,\u201d he said in a statement. In a letter to church leaders published on Friday in the state-owned Herald newspaper, Mnangagwa said the economic hardship had its roots in sanctions imposed by the west more than a decade ago as well as a severe drought this year. He also said Chamisa had rejected his invitation to dialogue meant to resolve Zimbabwe\u2019s political and economic problems. Nick Mangwana, the permanent secretary at the information ministry, issued a statement blaming an unidentified \u201cthird force\u201d for recent attacks on human rights activists and others. Zimbabwe is crippled by massive debts incurred during Mugabe\u2019s rule and needs a multibillion-dollar bailout to prevent economic collapse. However, continuing repression and a lack of tangible political reform mean there is little chance of international institutions offering major aid packages. \u201cThis is not about political parties but for every Zimbabwean who is suffering. So why are they beating us? I have children and grandchildren, but I can\u2019t even sell things on the streets to make a living because [the police] pounce on me,\u201d Lydia Gonese, a 42-year-old protester, said.",

Jones\u2019s apology comes a day and a half after his original comments, on the same day he doubled down and called her \u201cgormless\u201d and a \u201chypocrite\u201d, and just hours after companies began withdrawing advertising from his radio station. On Thursday evening, Jones, 78, said one had to \u201cman up, pivot, face it, and apologise\u201d when found to be wrong. Jones told 2GB\u2019s afternoon host, Ben Fordham, that his attention had been drawn to the fact that his comments had \u201cgiven offence\u201d. \u201cWhen that happens I have no difficulty apologising. Earlier today I did write to the New Zealand prime minister Jacinda [Ardern],\u201d he said. \u201cAmongst other things I said \u2026 I would never wish her any harm and would always wish her the best.\u201d He said his comments were nevertheless careless and \u201cshould have been more clearly thought\u201d. \u201cI have erred and made a mistake\u201d. The radio host of more than three decades and former prime ministerial speechwriter said that \u201cin this game you\u2019ve got to choose your words carefully and I didn\u2019t do that\u201d. Jones\u2019s original comments were met with outrage from the Fiji prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, former Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, and Morrison, who said they were \u201cway out of line\u201d. Jones\u2019s comments about climate change were also mostly factually wrong or misleading. On Thursday evening he accused critics of having \u201cwilfully misinterpreted\u201d his comments and said he actually meant he wanted Ardern to \u201cput a sock in it\u201d herself. However, he continued to defend himself on Friday morning by reading out reader messages of support, including one allegedly from an unnamed female political figure who he said told him she had never \u201cmet a man more supportive of women\u201d. He then said Ardern was gormless and a hypocrite, and maintained climate change concern was a hoax. A change.org petition calling for an advertising boycott drew tens of thousands of signatures and on Thursday ME Bank announced it had pulled its ads from Jones\u2019s show. \u201cWe take this very seriously and these types of comments don\u2019t reflect our values at all,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cWe\u2019ve expressed our concerns to 2GB and have pulled our advertising.\u201d Less than six hours later, Jones apologised. Also on Thursday afternoon, former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull added to his criticism of Jones. Turnbull told ABC\u2019s RN Drive program Jones was an \u201cappalling misogynist\u201d with a track record of using violent language against women as his \u201cregular rhetoric\u201d. Jones has repeatedly been criticised for misogynistic and other offensive comments over many years, and has usually offered apologies or been found by the regulator not to have breached standards. In 2012, he said that the then prime minister, Julia Gillard, should be \u201cshoved in a chaff bag\u201d and taken out to sea. \u201cThe woman\u2019s off her tree and quite frankly they should shove her and Bob Brown in a chaff bag and take them as far out to sea as they can and tell them to swim home,\u201d he said at the time. In the same year he said Gillard\u2019s father had died \u201cof shame\u201d because she \u201ctold lies every time she stood for parliament\u201d. In 2018 Jones was found to have breached \u201cgenerally accepted standards of decency\u201d in using a racist term in relation to federal minister Mathias Cormann. In 2007 Jones was found to have encouraged violence and vilified people of Lebanese and Middle Eastern backgrounds with comments made before the 2005 Cronulla riots.",

Portland braces for its biggest far-right rally of the Trump era Police in Portland, Oregon, are preparing for the possibility of violence ahead of what may be the city\u2019s biggest far-right rally of the Trump era on Saturday. The so-called \u201cEnd Domestic Terrorism\u201d rally has been organized in large part by Floridian Joe Biggs, a member of the far-right Proud Boys organization, and is aimed at Portland\u2019s antifascist groups, who in recent years have fought running street battles with rightwing activists at similar events. Joe Biggs. Biggs is a Trump supporter, a combat veteran, and a former employee of Alex Jones\u2019s conspiracy theory-fuelled broadcast network Infowars. Liberal utopia? A supposed bastion of liberal values, Portland has become an unlikely rallying point for the far-right in recent years. Jason Wilson explains why. Crib sheet Trump has urged the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, to \u201csit down\u201d with pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong to settle their differences, as the semi-autonomous territory prepares for another weekend of rallies and demonstrations. The US president has repeatedly expressed a desire to purchase the vast, icy island of Greenland from its current owners, Denmark \u2013 with \u201cwith varying degrees of seriousness\u201d, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal. North Korea has fired two more projectiles into the sea off its east coast as Pyongyang declared talks with the \u201cimpudent\u201d South were over, a day after the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, predicted the unification of the two countries by 2045.

Must-reads Dave Grohl\u2019s landmark tracks The Foo Fighters founder and former Nirvana drummer has a three-decade back catalogue to choose from as he picks the most significant songs of his career. Grohl tells Eve Barlow how Smells Like Teen Spirit changed his life, and why he never imagined himself as a frontman. 400 years since slavery: a timely reminder As the Guardian marks 400 years since the beginning of slavery in the US, Khushbu Shah and Juweek Adolphe present a timeline of American history from an African American perspective, while Tour\u00e9 says the anniversary is a reminder that Trump\u2019s white supremacist ideas represent a long, dark tradition. How the far-right\u2019s \u2018Eurabia\u2019 myth went mainstream The outlandish notion of a plot by liberal elites and Muslims to destroy European civilisation was once a conspiracy theory confined to the kookier corners of the internet. Andrew Wood explains how it entered mainstream politics via Europe\u2019s rising far-right. The unsolved murder haunting San Francisco A year after parts of the dismembered body of a former bartender, Brian Egg, were found in a fish tank at his home in San Francisco, his killer remains at large. Police freed the only known suspects, and Egg\u2019s neighbours are outraged by the perceived failings of the investigation, as Erin McCormick reports. Opinion When white nationalists commit deadly attacks like the El Paso shooting, there are more than 50 federal laws available to address it as a matter of domestic terrorism. Why won\u2019t the FBI prioritise it as such? Because they don\u2019t want to, says former agent Mike German. The FBI remains an overwhelmingly white, male organization, which may partly explain why it would treat white supremacist violence as a less serious concern than an imaginary Black Identity Extremist movement.

This is regrettable as we have always made safety and security our highest priority.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe therefore think it is time to put a new management team in place who can reset confidence and lead the airline to new heights.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/16/hong-kong-trump-calls-on-xi-to-talk-to-protesters-as-weekend-rallies-loom\">Hong Kong: Trump calls on Xi to talk to protesters as weekend rallies loom</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Hogg has become the most high profile corporate casualty of the standoff between Hong Kong\u2019s government and its increasingly impassioned residents, after the airline was drawn into the dispute when a pilot was arrested in July.</p> \n<p>As China increased the pressure, banks downgraded Cathay\u2019s rating for investors, and the aviation regulator told the airline it would have to submit the names of its crews for checks before flying over the mainland, and remove any staff who had been involved in protests.</p> \n<p>A number of Chinese firms effectively boycotted the airline, telling staff not to fly with Cathay for safety reasons. Although Cathay is a major international carrier, more than a fifth of its flights go to the Chinese mainland.</p> \n<p>The airline, a long-term partner of British Airways and others in the One World alliance, initially refused to censure any of its 27,000 employees for taking part in the pro-democracy protests. Slosar said he \u201ccertainly wouldn\u2019t dream of telling staff what to think\u201d.</p> \n<p>But on Monday Hogg emailed staff to say the airline had \u201ca zero-tolerance approach to illegal activities\u201d and that they could be fired if they supported or participated in the protests.</p> \n<p>Cathay has dismissed a number of its employees and acceded to the Chinese regulator\u2019s request, saying \u201coverly radical\u201d staff would be suspended from mainland duties.</p> \n<p>Pressure on the airline escalated dramatically this week after protests by thousands of people in the main terminal of Cathay\u2019s home hub, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/12/closure-of-hong-kong-airport-shines-fresh-light-on-protest-movement\">Hong Kong international </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/12/closure-of-hong-kong-airport-shines-fresh-light-on-protest-movement\">airport</a>, halted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/14/hong-kong-flights-resume-at-airport-after-clashes-between-protesters-and-police\">all passenger travel</a>, eventually forcing the airline to cancel more than 200 flights.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday, Cathay said it was \u201cdeeply concerned by the ongoing violence and disruption impacting Hong Kong\u201d. It added: \u201cWe resolutely support the Hong Kong SAR government, the chief executive and the police in their efforts to restore law and order \u2026 We must act now to stop the violence and preserve the stability, peace and prosperity of Hong Kong.\u201d</p> \n<p>Announcing Hogg\u2019s departure on Friday, Slosar said: \u201cCathay Pacific is fully committed to Hong Kong under the principle of one country, two systems, as enshrined in the basic law.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e80b6ab4-1d25-46f8-abfe-663067682403\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uF0mcZ3Su-Q?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Shares in the carrier fell on Tuesday to their lowest point in a decade, before recovering slightly by the end of the week. Before being caught up in Hong Kong\u2019s political clashes, Cathay\u2019s stock had already suffered from the effects of the Chinese economic slowdown, exacerbated by the US-China trade skirmishes, with its cargo business taking a hit as exports slowed.</p> \n<p>After three years at the helm, Hogg will be replaced by Augustus Tang, the chief executive of Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering, Cathay\u2019s sister company within the Swire Pacific group. Hogg said: \u201cThese have been challenging weeks for the airline and it is right that Paul [Loo] and I take responsibility as leaders of the company.\u201d</p> \n<p>Protesters are preparing for another weekend of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. China has massed armoured personnel carriers on the border, raising fears that it may intervene with military force.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The head of Cathay Pacific has quit after protests in Hong Kong led to a plunge in the airline\u2019s share price and it came under pressure from Chinese authorities to rein in employees who were supporting the pro-democracy demonstrators. Rupert Hogg, the company\u2019s British chief executive, and Paul Loo, the chief customer and commercial officer, tendered their resignations to the board on Friday. The news of their departures broke on Chinese state media rather than on Hong Kong business channels, fuelling suspicions that the move was dictated by anger in Beijing. The airline\u2019s chairman and former chief executive, John Slosar, said: \u201cRecent events have called into question Cathay Pacific\u2019s commitment to flight safety and security and put our reputation and brand under pressure. This is regrettable as we have always made safety and security our highest priority. \u201cWe therefore think it is time to put a new management team in place who can reset confidence and lead the airline to new heights.\u201d Hogg has become the most high profile corporate casualty of the standoff between Hong Kong\u2019s government and its increasingly impassioned residents, after the airline was drawn into the dispute when a pilot was arrested in July. As China increased the pressure, banks downgraded Cathay\u2019s rating for investors, and the aviation regulator told the airline it would have to submit the names of its crews for checks before flying over the mainland, and remove any staff who had been involved in protests. A number of Chinese firms effectively boycotted the airline, telling staff not to fly with Cathay for safety reasons. Although Cathay is a major international carrier, more than a fifth of its flights go to the Chinese mainland. The airline, a long-term partner of British Airways and others in the One World alliance, initially refused to censure any of its 27,000 employees for taking part in the pro-democracy protests. Slosar said he \u201ccertainly wouldn\u2019t dream of telling staff what to think\u201d. But on Monday Hogg emailed staff to say the airline had \u201ca zero-tolerance approach to illegal activities\u201d and that they could be fired if they supported or participated in the protests. Cathay has dismissed a number of its employees and acceded to the Chinese regulator\u2019s request, saying \u201coverly radical\u201d staff would be suspended from mainland duties. Pressure on the airline escalated dramatically this week after protests by thousands of people in the main terminal of Cathay\u2019s home hub, Hong Kong international airport, halted all passenger travel, eventually forcing the airline to cancel more than 200 flights. On Tuesday, Cathay said it was \u201cdeeply concerned by the ongoing violence and disruption impacting Hong Kong\u201d. It added: \u201cWe resolutely support the Hong Kong SAR government, the chief executive and the police in their efforts to restore law and order \u2026 We must act now to stop the violence and preserve the stability, peace and prosperity of Hong Kong.\u201d Announcing Hogg\u2019s departure on Friday, Slosar said: \u201cCathay Pacific is fully committed to Hong Kong under the principle of one country, two systems, as enshrined in the basic law.\u201d Shares in the carrier fell on Tuesday to their lowest point in a decade, before recovering slightly by the end of the week. Before being caught up in Hong Kong\u2019s political clashes, Cathay\u2019s stock had already suffered from the effects of the Chinese economic slowdown, exacerbated by the US-China trade skirmishes, with its cargo business taking a hit as exports slowed. After three years at the helm, Hogg will be replaced by Augustus Tang, the chief executive of Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering, Cathay\u2019s sister company within the Swire Pacific group. Hogg said: \u201cThese have been challenging weeks for the airline and it is right that Paul [Loo] and I take responsibility as leaders of the company.\u201d Protesters are preparing for another weekend of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. China has massed armoured personnel carriers on the border, raising fears that it may intervene with military force.",

In June, Julen Lopetegui, the man who\u2019s now held <a href=\"https://www.espn.in/football/spanish-primera-division/15/blog/post/3882913/after-real-madrid-failurelopetegui--is-on-a-mission-with-sevilla\">three of the country\u2019s five biggest jobs</a> in a year, suggested this might be the busiest summer ever, and he was right.

When, that is, they finally managed to find the <em>incommunicado</em> Uruguayan: he\u2019d truly gone fishing.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/12/athletic-bilbao-gaizka-garitano\">Athletic Bilbao\u2019s Gaizka Garitano: \u2018When I got married I bought a flat next to the training ground\u2019 | Will Unwin</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>La Liga have left it very late to do a live rights deal with ITV, but La Liga\u2019s teams have done hundreds this summer. Some players have gone: Wissam Ben Yedder, like Pablo Sarabia, has just left Sevilla for France; Rodri is at Manchester City. But I\u00f1aki Williams just signed a new, nine-year deal at Athletic, suitors seen off. And a busy summer has brought more signings than ever, including Kieran Trippier, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/19/kieran-trippier-meets-atletico-madrid-fitness-coach-oscar-ortega\">came face to face with a sadist</a> and momentarily gave the <em>primera</em> a British trio, with Wales\u2019s Gareth Bale and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/07/jack-harper-interview-real-madrid-malaga-scotland\">Scotland\u2019s Jack Harper</a> \u2013 until Getafe\u2019s new signing was loaned to Alcorc\u00f3n.</p> \n<p>The immense majority of the outlay, up beyond \u20ac1.3bn now, was of course at the top of a league where, despite improvements, the imbalance remains huge. But if Barcelona, Atl\u00e9tico and Real Madrid have spent more than anyone else in Spain, accounting for three-quarters of the money in this market, what makes it different this time is that they\u2019ve also spent more than anyone else, anywhere else. Juventus, City, United, Arsenal ... all of them trail behind.</p> \n<p>There\u2019s a pretty simple reason they spent so much: they had to. Or thought they did. What happened last year will not be good enough this time. Even for Barcelona in first, so imagine what it\u2019s like for Madrid.</p> \n<p>Real Madrid were 19 points off the top last year; they\u2019d been 17 off the year before. They\u2019ve finished third two years in a row: they hadn\u2019t been outside the top two in consecutive seasons for 45 years. The European Cup helps, of course, but they can\u2019t allow that again. \u201cThere will be changes,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/mar/11/zinedine-zidane-returns-real-madrid-coach-santiago-solari\">Zinedine Zidane said</a>. He\u2019d returned early; in part the price to pay for authority, a club commitment <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/mar/12/zinedine-zidane-real-madrid-return-masterstroke-bernabeu-manager\">to sign the players he wanted</a>. It was a political masterstroke, the fire put out, but then came the football, which has a habit of getting in the way. Reality. And not all of those promises were easy to fulfil.</p> \n<p>Eden Hazard <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/13/eden-hazard-fulfils-dream-real-madrid-move\">was in quickly</a>, but that feels like a long time ago now. Which is partly because it was \u2013 two months have passed \u2013 and partly because not enough players have followed him. Instead, pessimism has. Zidane is increasingly uncomfortable, glimpses of tension, a power struggle occasionally emerging. He has stopped doing press conferences. Madrid have spent almost \u20ac300m. Ferland Mendy, \u00c9der Milit\u00e3o and Luka Jovic have all arrived but money isn\u2019t limitless, despite appearances on both sides of Spain\u2019s divide, and Paul Pogba hasn\u2019t.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Gareth Bale \u2013 <em>\u00a1hola, m\u00edster! </em>\u2013 is still there, Madrid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/21/zinedine-zidane-says-gareth-bale-could-leave-real-madrid-in-a-matter-of-days-football\">backing out of their agreement</a> to let him go to China. So is James Rodr\u00edguez, back from Munich. And Sergio Ramos, whose move to China was blocked at the start of the summer, providing a little pantomime and a comic litany of lies, exposed with almost every utterance. Zidane didn\u2019t want Ramos to go, but he didn\u2019t want James or Bale to stay.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3aa2d33a-ec52-4abb-94d4-21572a61a965\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>La Liga has agreed a broadcasting deal with ITV for games to be shown live this season. The campaign begins tonight and the curtain raiser between Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona will be shown on terrestrial television on ITV4 and the ITV Hub from 8pm.

The hostility became genuinely startling, but there was no solution. Now they must live together. James too, by the looks of it \u2013 his preference was Atl\u00e9tico and Madrid wouldn\u2019t countenance that. Although Zidane does rightly remind everyone that anything can happen between now and the end of the month.</p> \n<p>He needs something to happen. If pre-season is a time for building a team, an identity \u2013 and for messing about playing lucrative friendlies in pseudo-competitions a very long way away \u2013 Madrid still don\u2019t know who they are. One paper here did a summer league table and Madrid were bottom. Newly promoted Granada, by the way, were top. Madrid have let in 18 goals, tried three at the back and looked ... well, not very good. Their flaws look familiar. It\u2019s only preseason \u2013 \u201cwe treated it as a friendly, they didn\u2019t,\u201d Ramos insisted after one game \u2013 but Zidane didn\u2019t sign up for this and nor did they; this wasn\u2019t the plan, if there is one.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: Sign up for our free football newsletter.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: Sign up for our free football newsletter.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In one game, they were 5-0 down at half time.

And that\u2019s the thing: for now, the most exciting thing this summer. Not least because no one really expected this. Antoine Griezmann left for Barcelona, a deal a year in the making. Juanfran, Diego God\u00edn, Lucas Hern\u00e1ndez, Felipe Luis <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/09/rodri-manchester-city-sergio-busquets-comparisons\">and Rodri departed</a> too. Six of the typical starting XI had gone, so Atl\u00e9tico signed. Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/04/joao-felix-atletico-madrid-gamble-diego-simeone\">arrived for \u20ac126m</a>, more than double their all-time record signing, and they didn\u2019t stop there.</p> \n<p>They\u2019ve signed seven players: Joao Felix, Mario Hermoso, Lodi, Marcos Llorente, Felipe, H\u00e9ctor Herrera, Trippier. Valencia\u2019s Rodrigo is likely to join them. It has cost \u20ac256m \u2013 and they\u2019re still in credit by \u20ac31m. When people ask who won the transfer window \u2013 apart from Jorge Mendes, of course \u2013 the answer is almost unanimous: Atl\u00e9tico did.</p> \n<p>The pessimism of those departures, the soul of the team ripped out, has gone. In its place is euphoria; they try to fight it but they can\u2019t help being excited. Six left, mostly celebrated amid sadness, the inevitable passage of time. The year before, Torres and Gabi had gone, and it wasn\u2019t just the names or the numbers; it was identity, everything they are. They <em>were</em> Atl\u00e9tico, and Atl\u00e9tico was over. Only maybe it wasn\u2019t. Sa\u00fal stayed, Koke stayed, Costa stayed, Oblak stayed. And then something happened.</p> \n<p>Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix came. He is 19, he is not like the others and if he was to fit, if they all were, something would have to change. This would have to be a new Atl\u00e9tico, a team with a new identity, a different approach. That was a concern, of course, but the surprise is that it might be just that. And get this \u2013 it might even work.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4a1e5a37cd3bdd1a17d8393a82dd3916e042cec4\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a1e5a37cd3bdd1a17d8393a82dd3916e042cec4/0_0_5556_3712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Luis Su\u00e1rez\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luis Su\u00e1rez celebrates with Antoine Griezmann after scoring a goal in the La Liga-Serie A Cup match between Barcelona and Napoli.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allan Dranberg/CSM/Rex Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThe manager wants us to be more attacking, have a little more of the ball, look towards the opposition\u2019s goal a little more,\u201d Koke said. There have been suggestions before that they would evolve, but they have tended to<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/dec/11/atletico-get-back-to-what-they-know-and-make-la-liga-a-four-horse-race\"> get back to what they know</a>, their essence eternal, Diego Simeone <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/sep/25/diego-costa-and-the-new-atletico-same-as-the-old-atletico\">wedded to an idea</a>, and so it was natural to be sceptical this time. But the early signs are they really could change: now they might actually <em>be</em> different, and good at it. It turns out that Joao F\u00e9lix really <em>is</em> good.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s only pre-season, remember. It\u2019s early. Everyone thinks this is their year until it\u2019s not. Atletico are still only 12-1 to win the league. And they are, or were, the club that has had more false dawns than Truman Burbank. And yet they can\u2019t help it, and who would begrudge them that? Perhaps it even makes sense to demand more now? There was satisfaction in Simeone\u2019s voice last season when he noted the \u201crespect\u201d implicit in Barcelona recognising them as their \u201cnearest competitors\u201d. But that might change now: settling for second, seeing it as an achievement \u2013 which it is, especially two years in a row \u2013 might not wash with this team. They finished 11 points behind last year, 14 the year before. This year, in the very summer you wondered if it might be over, second alone could be insufficient. Time to really compete.</p> \n<p>Thing is, it\u2019s still Barcelona above them. Still Leo Messi, so far above everyone else it\u2019s silly at times. The team for whom the double was insufficient in 2017-18, and just the league in 2018-19 was even worse, defeats <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/08/press-reaction-barcelona-defeat-liverpool-anfield-semi-champions-league\">against Liverpool</a> in the Champions League semi-final and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/25/barcelona-valencia-copa-del-rey-final-match-report\">Valencia in the Copa del Rey final</a>, like Roma the year before, doing serious damage. Ernesto Valverde, their manager, survived. Just. And few were happy about it. Which might sound odd for a coach whose team over the last two seasons have finished a combined 25 points above Atl\u00e9tico, 36 over Madrid. But, then, so what?</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/26/gareth-bale-real-madrid-hero-why-gone-wrong\">Gareth Bale could be a Real Madrid cult hero so why has it gone so wrong? | Jonathan Wilson</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Being the best \u2013 by a long, long, long way \u2013 is not enough. Which is not why they\u2019re still pursuing Neymar: that\u2019s a story for another day. But it is why they just signed <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/barcelona/story/3899070/barcelona-finally-sign-griezmannwill-neymar-be-next-its-complicated\">Atletico\u2019s best player</a>, why they signed Frenkie de Jong, and why the best era in their history risks being overlooked, victims of their own success. Here, at least. In Europe, it\u2019s four years now since they won. That trophy, the one Messi described as \u201clovely and desired\u201d at the beginning of last season, his words taken as a promise, will define them. Whether that\u2019s fair is another question.</p> \n<p>A few days ago, Messi took the mic at the centre of the Camp Nou pitch again, a year on. It could have been a political rally; no one had ever heard him like this. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say anything after last season, but I don\u2019t regret anything\u201d he said, \u201cit ended being a bit bitter but we have to appreciate the league we won.\u201d He paused and then said, almost shouting, verbally jabbing his finger, a point to make: \u201cthe <em>eighth</em> in 11 years. For any club that would be huge, for us it is very important too. Maybe one day in a few years we\u2019ll look back and realise how difficult it was.\u201d</p> \n<p>Maybe one day, they will. For now though, starting on Friday at San Mam\u00e9s, they must do it again \u2013 and more.</p>",

When, that is, they finally managed to find the incommunicado Uruguayan: he\u2019d truly gone fishing. La Liga have left it very late to do a live rights deal with ITV, but La Liga\u2019s teams have done hundreds this summer. Some players have gone: Wissam Ben Yedder, like Pablo Sarabia, has just left Sevilla for France; Rodri is at Manchester City. But I\u00f1aki Williams just signed a new, nine-year deal at Athletic, suitors seen off. And a busy summer has brought more signings than ever, including Kieran Trippier, who came face to face with a sadist and momentarily gave the primera a British trio, with Wales\u2019s Gareth Bale and Scotland\u2019s Jack Harper \u2013 until Getafe\u2019s new signing was loaned to Alcorc\u00f3n. The immense majority of the outlay, up beyond \u20ac1.3bn now, was of course at the top of a league where, despite improvements, the imbalance remains huge. But if Barcelona, Atl\u00e9tico and Real Madrid have spent more than anyone else in Spain, accounting for three-quarters of the money in this market, what makes it different this time is that they\u2019ve also spent more than anyone else, anywhere else. Juventus, City, United, Arsenal ... all of them trail behind. There\u2019s a pretty simple reason they spent so much: they had to. Or thought they did. What happened last year will not be good enough this time. Even for Barcelona in first, so imagine what it\u2019s like for Madrid. Real Madrid were 19 points off the top last year; they\u2019d been 17 off the year before. They\u2019ve finished third two years in a row: they hadn\u2019t been outside the top two in consecutive seasons for 45 years. The European Cup helps, of course, but they can\u2019t allow that again. \u201cThere will be changes,\u201d Zinedine Zidane said. He\u2019d returned early; in part the price to pay for authority, a club commitment to sign the players he wanted. It was a political masterstroke, the fire put out, but then came the football, which has a habit of getting in the way. Reality. And not all of those promises were easy to fulfil. Eden Hazard was in quickly, but that feels like a long time ago now. Which is partly because it was \u2013 two months have passed \u2013 and partly because not enough players have followed him. Instead, pessimism has. Zidane is increasingly uncomfortable, glimpses of tension, a power struggle occasionally emerging. He has stopped doing press conferences. Madrid have spent almost \u20ac300m. Ferland Mendy, \u00c9der Milit\u00e3o and Luka Jovic have all arrived but money isn\u2019t limitless, despite appearances on both sides of Spain\u2019s divide, and Paul Pogba hasn\u2019t. Meanwhile, Gareth Bale \u2013 \u00a1hola, m\u00edster! \u2013 is still there, Madrid backing out of their agreement to let him go to China. So is James Rodr\u00edguez, back from Munich. And Sergio Ramos, whose move to China was blocked at the start of the summer, providing a little pantomime and a comic litany of lies, exposed with almost every utterance. Zidane didn\u2019t want Ramos to go, but he didn\u2019t want James or Bale to stay. \u201cIt\u2019s clear what I have done,\u201d he said about the Welshman having left him out repeatedly late last season, and it got even clearer: he wanted Bale out, \u201cthe sooner the better\u201d. The hostility became genuinely startling, but there was no solution. Now they must live together. James too, by the looks of it \u2013 his preference was Atl\u00e9tico and Madrid wouldn\u2019t countenance that. Although Zidane does rightly remind everyone that anything can happen between now and the end of the month. He needs something to happen. If pre-season is a time for building a team, an identity \u2013 and for messing about playing lucrative friendlies in pseudo-competitions a very long way away \u2013 Madrid still don\u2019t know who they are. One paper here did a summer league table and Madrid were bottom. Newly promoted Granada, by the way, were top. Madrid have let in 18 goals, tried three at the back and looked ... well, not very good. Their flaws look familiar. It\u2019s only preseason \u2013 \u201cwe treated it as a friendly, they didn\u2019t,\u201d Ramos insisted after one game \u2013 but Zidane didn\u2019t sign up for this and nor did they; this wasn\u2019t the plan, if there is one. In one game, they were 5-0 down at half time. By full time, they had been beaten 7-3. By Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. And that\u2019s the thing: for now, the most exciting thing this summer. Not least because no one really expected this. Antoine Griezmann left for Barcelona, a deal a year in the making. Juanfran, Diego God\u00edn, Lucas Hern\u00e1ndez, Felipe Luis and Rodri departed too. Six of the typical starting XI had gone, so Atl\u00e9tico signed. Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix arrived for \u20ac126m, more than double their all-time record signing, and they didn\u2019t stop there. They\u2019ve signed seven players: Joao Felix, Mario Hermoso, Lodi, Marcos Llorente, Felipe, H\u00e9ctor Herrera, Trippier. Valencia\u2019s Rodrigo is likely to join them. It has cost \u20ac256m \u2013 and they\u2019re still in credit by \u20ac31m. When people ask who won the transfer window \u2013 apart from Jorge Mendes, of course \u2013 the answer is almost unanimous: Atl\u00e9tico did. The pessimism of those departures, the soul of the team ripped out, has gone. In its place is euphoria; they try to fight it but they can\u2019t help being excited. Six left, mostly celebrated amid sadness, the inevitable passage of time. The year before, Torres and Gabi had gone, and it wasn\u2019t just the names or the numbers; it was identity, everything they are. They were Atl\u00e9tico, and Atl\u00e9tico was over. Only maybe it wasn\u2019t. Sa\u00fal stayed, Koke stayed, Costa stayed, Oblak stayed. And then something happened. Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix came. He is 19, he is not like the others and if he was to fit, if they all were, something would have to change. This would have to be a new Atl\u00e9tico, a team with a new identity, a different approach. That was a concern, of course, but the surprise is that it might be just that. And get this \u2013 it might even work. \u201cThe manager wants us to be more attacking, have a little more of the ball, look towards the opposition\u2019s goal a little more,\u201d Koke said. There have been suggestions before that they would evolve, but they have tended to get back to what they know, their essence eternal, Diego Simeone wedded to an idea, and so it was natural to be sceptical this time. But the early signs are they really could change: now they might actually be different, and good at it. It turns out that Joao F\u00e9lix really is good. It\u2019s only pre-season, remember. It\u2019s early. Everyone thinks this is their year until it\u2019s not. Atletico are still only 12-1 to win the league. And they are, or were, the club that has had more false dawns than Truman Burbank. And yet they can\u2019t help it, and who would begrudge them that? Perhaps it even makes sense to demand more now? There was satisfaction in Simeone\u2019s voice last season when he noted the \u201crespect\u201d implicit in Barcelona recognising them as their \u201cnearest competitors\u201d. But that might change now: settling for second, seeing it as an achievement \u2013 which it is, especially two years in a row \u2013 might not wash with this team. They finished 11 points behind last year, 14 the year before. This year, in the very summer you wondered if it might be over, second alone could be insufficient. Time to really compete. Thing is, it\u2019s still Barcelona above them. Still Leo Messi, so far above everyone else it\u2019s silly at times. The team for whom the double was insufficient in 2017-18, and just the league in 2018-19 was even worse, defeats against Liverpool in the Champions League semi-final and Valencia in the Copa del Rey final, like Roma the year before, doing serious damage. Ernesto Valverde, their manager, survived. Just. And few were happy about it. Which might sound odd for a coach whose team over the last two seasons have finished a combined 25 points above Atl\u00e9tico, 36 over Madrid. But, then, so what? Being the best \u2013 by a long, long, long way \u2013 is not enough. Which is not why they\u2019re still pursuing Neymar: that\u2019s a story for another day. But it is why they just signed Atletico\u2019s best player, why they signed Frenkie de Jong, and why the best era in their history risks being overlooked, victims of their own success. Here, at least. In Europe, it\u2019s four years now since they won. That trophy, the one Messi described as \u201clovely and desired\u201d at the beginning of last season, his words taken as a promise, will define them. Whether that\u2019s fair is another question. A few days ago, Messi took the mic at the centre of the Camp Nou pitch again, a year on. It could have been a political rally; no one had ever heard him like this. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say anything after last season, but I don\u2019t regret anything\u201d he said, \u201cit ended being a bit bitter but we have to appreciate the league we won.\u201d He paused and then said, almost shouting, verbally jabbing his finger, a point to make: \u201cthe eighth in 11 years. For any club that would be huge, for us it is very important too. Maybe one day in a few years we\u2019ll look back and realise how difficult it was.\u201d Maybe one day, they will. For now though, starting on Friday at San Mam\u00e9s, they must do it again \u2013 and more.",

Do your bit to alleviate that voracious global demand.</p> <p>Like many of the finer things in life, avocado toast is best eaten as a treat, an infrequent break from the norm. And when we do eat it, it had better be done right. That is where How to Eat (HTE), the series examining how best to enjoy Britain\u2019s favourite foods, can help.</p> <h2><strong>Notes on construction</strong></h2> <p>Fun fact: avocado toast existed before 1993. It was common in California in the 1960s. The New Yorker printed a recipe in 1937. Logically, it was probably \u201cinvented\u201d thousands of years prior when some unknown Central American hero applied heat to bread and avocado to toast. But contemporary avo toast, Sydney-style avo toast, was <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-gastronomy/the-man-who-made-the-australian-cafe-and-yes-avocado-toast-a-global-phenomenon\">popularised by Australian chef-restaurateur Bill Granger</a>, whose early 90s version \u2013 toast, mashed avocado, lime, salt, chilli flakes \u2013 has since taken over the world.</p> <p>It is barely a recipe, more assembly than cooking. That is why so much anal attention is paid to the nature and treatment of its key components. Historians have yet to isolate precisely when mashed avocado became \u201csmashed\u201d avocado, but that smashing is <em>crucial</em>. Why? Well, as the comedian Geoff Norcott, frontman for BBC Two\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jul/23/tv-tonight-is-middle-class-hypocrisy-really-ruining-britain\">How the Middle-Class Ruined Britain</a>, put it recently: \u201cNo \u2018fruit\u2019 should have such an oily, meaty texture.\u201d</p> <p>That is why we smash, Geoff. Sliced and elegantly fanned across toast, avocado is a bland and bizarrely creamy freak of nature: vegetal but not vegetable, cold, curiously slimy and offering little interest because the essential seasoning that brings it to life \u2013 lemon and salt, at the very least \u2013 won\u2019t properly adhere. Seasoning can only be thoroughly distributed through smashed avocado, and that smashing must be done by hand using a fork, to avoid an eerily fluffy, wet, machine-processed texture.</p> <p>You want it smooth but dense, like Michelin-starred mashed potatoes, or Dominic Raab. In Australia, the seasonal interval in which Hass avocados (creamier, great smashed) are replaced by the Shepard variety (firmer, better for slicing), provokes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/mar/19/avocad-no-why-does-everyone-hate-the-shepard-avocado\">national mourning</a>. HTE can sympathise with that.</p> <p>The bread that this smashed avo sits on must be inch-thick toasted sourdough. Not white sliced bread, which looks thin, mean and lost under a mound of avocado; not ciabatta (its woolly crumb lacks the crisp textural contrast that sourdough offers); nor English muffins, <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/avocado-toast\">as favoured by the musician Van Dyke Parks</a>. Sourdough is one of the few breads robust enough to provide a platform for a great moist dollop of avo; plus, like the added citric acid, its lactic edge is fundamental to the interplay of this dish where sharp, hot flavours and crunchy textures dance like excited fireflies around the rich, soft avocado core.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4071f8bba2aad2a464c0206aa9c252f32ce0dec7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4071f8bba2aad2a464c0206aa9c252f32ce0dec7/0_286_4996_2996/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Egg on a slice of avocado toast\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Is egg an acceptable addition?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Malan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Plating and design</strong></h2> <p>With its vivid colours, it is little wonder avo toast has become such an online hit. A mess of bright, sunny ingredients invariably looks good on Instagram. Rarely, however, have aesthetics intersected so dramatically with how we enjoy a dish. As discussed above, sliced avocado (often arranged in ornate, eerie geometric patterns) is far less pleasurable than smashed. Attempts by chefs to tame this dish kill it.</p> <p>Using avocado like butter (\u201cA fat that you spread on toast,\u201d as one Australian chef <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/a-grand-unified-theory-of-avocado-toast\">told the New Yorker</a>) is chefs\u2019 first mistake. Particularly when that avocado is spread thinly, primly and neatly to the edges of the sourdough, this dish begins to morph. It becomes as much about the toast as the avo, which is wrong. Smashed, well-seasoned avocado should be the star here, distributed in large random clumps, its thickness speaking of the fruitful harvests of distant sun-drenched climates.</p> <p>You do not want buttoned-up order here, you want colourful chaos: thick slices of toast at angles atop one another, hillocks of avo, sprinkled and adorned with extras (see below) until it looks as if your plate is generously overflowing with ingredients.</p> <p>Apparently, some chefs use coloured crockery \u2013 grey or black plates, say \u2013 to turn up the colour contrast with the avo. While it makes sense to avoid a direct clash (eg blue or maroon plates), a stark white background works fine.</p> <h2><strong>Additions</strong></h2> <p>Sharp, salty and/or crunchy are the aims here, to titivate and offset the creamy avo. There are caveats, however. Citric or spritzy fermented sharpness is preferable to the bruising vinegary twang of, for instance, pickled gherkins. Also, do you need meat? Adding bacon or chorizo to avo toast is like Billy Corgan joining New Order, a guest MC dropping a verse on a Kendrick Lamar track or LCD Soundsystem reforming to make American Dream. It is an inflection, it adds another layer of interest to a familiar experience, but it is far from essential. In fact, if overused, all that meaty, umami bass in the mix can actively detract from an already perfect creation.</p> <p><strong>Eggs:</strong> Those eggs must be poached or fried, not scrambled, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/aug/22/alexa-chung-scrambled-eggs-avocado-breakfast-recipe\">as favoured by fashion\u2019s Alexa Chung</a>. Scrambling introduces a poorly distinguished rubbery or pillowy dimension to the plate, whereas the tense white of a poached egg or the crispy edges of a fried egg offer a point of difference and also waves of golden yolk to help lubricate your plate.</p> <p><strong>Other good additions: </strong>Crumbled feta (on top, in large pieces, not blitzed to a powder and mixed through); nutty, spicy dukkah; smoked chilli flakes, but not too many (the heat should be restrained); some sort of almost dry, jammy harissa salsa; toasted hazelnuts; halloumi; crispy onions; lightly pickled pink onions; fermented pickled veg; a little labneh or garlic creme fraiche to loosen the plate; a dusting of sumac; a few judicious drops of hot sauce.</p> <p><strong>Bad additions: </strong>Sliced cucumber, tomatoes or radishes \u2013 a blank, watery interruption of this rich, indulgent dish; grated carrot; pickled gherkins or similarly robustly vinegary vegetables; Marmite; untoasted sesame seeds (a lazy, texturally unsatisfying shortcut); soft ricotta (what is this adding!?); smoked salmon, one greasy, slippery component too far; \u201cMexican beans\u201d (HTE can see where you\u2019re going there \u2026 but no); crab or prawns, delicate flavours best enjoyed in a less cluttered setting; rocket, unnecessary padding with an unsuitably strong peppery flavour.</p> <h2><strong>When</strong></h2> <p>Too busy for an early breakfast and (if it\u2019s a good one) too filling for a weekday lunch, avo toast is, arguably, the definitive brunch dish: a free-floating 10am through 2pm weekend gift to yourself. Best eaten when mildly hungover or at a loose end, when you can sit and digest it at your leisure.</p> <h2><strong>Where</strong></h2> <p>Great avo toast requires a practised hand, a lot of high-quality components and, perhaps most difficult of all given their ridiculously short window of optimum edibility, ripe avocados. Therefore, and particularly if you want to minimise food waste, it is best eaten in a cafe or restaurant, rather than at home. You can come unstuck, of course. You may be <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/kzygee/complaint-about-dollar22-avocado-toast-order-leads-to-twitter-dumpster-fire\">delivered a car crash of an avo toast for $22</a> or find yourself in the Australian cafe that, for A$18 (\u00a310), serves toast and half an avocado to diners (as a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/mbwv5y/this-upsetting-dollar13-avocado-toast-is-just-a-sad-pile-of-ingredients\">homage to the avocado and the farms</a>\u201d), and expects them to do the mashing and spreading themselves.

      "body": "<p>The US launch of the Sega Genesis, on 14 August 1989, probably didn\u2019t seem like a huge deal outside the video game industry. The machine was launched in Japan the year before under a different name \u2013 the Mega Drive \u2013 and with a couple of decent arcade conversions, Space Harrier II and Super Thunder Blade, but not much in the way of fanfare. Nintendo utterly dominated the games business at that time, with a 95% share of the console sector and most of the biggest Japanese developers locked into exclusive deals to make games for its NES and forthcoming SNES consoles. The Mega Drive did OK in Japan but it was small fry \u2013 a cult machine.</p> <p>But David Rosen, who co-founded Sega after serving with the US air force in Japan during the Korean war, was determined to make a real event of the console\u2019s launch in his native country. The first games machine with a 16-bit processor, and boasting beautiful, colourful visuals, excellent sound and enough power to handle accurate arcade conversions, it had all the credentials of a hit. All he had to do was get US gamers to recognise it. So he rebranded it Genesis \u2013 a name he thought was cool and symbolised Sega\u2019s rebirth \u2013 and then he started building.</p> <p>At that time, Sega of America was basically a trading outpost; 30 staff in a small office, handling distribution and modest marketing budgets. To take things up a step, Rosen brought in Michael Katz as CEO, a combative exec with years of experience at blue-chip companies such as Colgate and Proctor &amp; Gamble, as well as a stint at early console manufacturer <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coleco\">Coleco</a>. Katz immediately challenged the polite business practices of his bosses at Sega of Japan by funding a TV and print advertising campaign that set out to belittle Nintendo and its quaint, family-orientated consoles. This was just the way he\u2019d always done things.</p> <p>\u201cIn my first week at Coleco I was asked to approve an ad for a game that was a direct competitor against Mattel\u2019s Football,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt was a wonderful ad, two guys dressed up as football players, one as Coleco Electronic Quarterback and one as Mattel Football. The two guys boast throughout the commercial, with the Coleco guy countering everything the Mattel guy says. It was the first directly competitive commercial in the games industry. But it was nothing new to me.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7nsBoqJ6s8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/k7nsBoqJ6s8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>So Katz went for Nintendo with the advertising slogan \u201cGenesis does what Nintendon\u2019t\u201d, and suddenly Sega had a new image as the brash bad boy of the industry. \u201cI knew that for every marketing dollar I had, Nintendo had 10,\u201d says then director of marketing Al Nilsen, who joined Sega of America when there were only three other people in the team. \u201cYou didn\u2019t play video games back then, you played Nintendo. Sega was an afterthought. We couldn\u2019t go after their core audience: children. Peter Main, their head of marketing basically said, just get the six to 12 year olds, that\u2019s all we need.</p> <p>\u201cSo I looked at what we had that Nintendo didn\u2019t and it was our arcade heritage. Golden Axe, Space Harrier \u2013 these were Sega classics, and the Genesis system was the first console that could bring that arcade experience home. I looked at who was playing in the arcades \u2013 and this was back in the day, when they were on every street corner \u2013 and it wasn\u2019t six to 12-year-old boys, it was teenagers and young adults. They went there because that\u2019s where the best games were. And that\u2019s also where the girls were. I said: \u2018This is my market\u2019\u201d.</p> <p>So Sega went straight for the teenagers with aggressive, rock music-driven, jump cut-filled TV ads, initally produced by slick PR and advertising agency Bozell, and later by Goodby, Berlin &amp; Silverstein, who masterminded the \u201c<a href=\"https://youtu.be/MY61zUle52g\">Welcome to the Next Level</a>\u201d TV commercials and would go on to make the famed \u201cGot Milk\u201d campaign.</p> <p>But Katz knew if the Genesis was really going to rule in the US, it needed something else: celebrity endorsement. This became another vital focus. \u201cWhen I got to Sega, we needed hot licensed software with names that consumers would recognise,\u201d he says. \u201cIf we could get that, we\u2019d be able to compete with Nintendo. So I said let\u2019s go after personalities. Let\u2019s go after the hottest athlete in the States \u2013 that was Joe Montana \u2013 then we\u2019d extend that to boxing and everything else.\u201d The eventual result was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Montana_Football\">Joe Montana Football</a> from Electronic Arts, a huge hit that spawned several sequels. \u201cWe didn\u2019t realise we were competing with Nintendo for Montana,\u201d says Katz. \u201cWe beat them out by a couple of hundred thousand dollars, and after that I discovered I\u2019d been bidding against [Nintendo of America chairman] Howard Lincoln. That was gratifying \u2013 it signalled that we were beginning to gain traction.\u201d</p> <p>Also vital to the success of the Genesis was Sega of America\u2019s determination to bring US developers on to the console. There was an understanding that they wouldn\u2019t beat the Super Nintendo with arcade conversions alone \u2013 they needed local talent. So they approached US studios such as Accolade, Spectrum Holobyte and, of course, Electronic Arts to support the console.</p> <p>\u201cSega were always going to make a good job of bringing over their arcade games, but the total product offering was narrow,\u201d says EA founder Trip Hawkins. \u201cThe 16-bit market was new and a lot of developers had come to understand how much more they could do with it. We really pushed the envelope and explored genres that others weren\u2019t really willing to try at the time \u2013 sports simulations being the most pervasive example, but then there was true innovation. Populous invented a new genre.\u201d</p> <p>The Sega Genesis didn\u2019t just make games cool, it changed how consoles were marketed, and widened the scope of console game development beyond Japanese powerhouses such as Nintendo, Capcom, Konami and Taito. There was a slightly combative relationship between Sega of Japan and Sega of America, and this led to a richly creative period of development, culminating in the arrival of Sonic the Hedgehog, a Japanese character infused with the bombastic qualities of 1990s US pop culture.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c37b0e2fa73d085bac569d87e8163c25b6a52b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c37b0e2fa73d085bac569d87e8163c25b6a52b8/0_31_640_384/500.jpg\" alt=\"East meets west \u2026 Sonic the Hedgehog fused Japanese character design with US pop culture.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">East meets west \u2026 Sonic the Hedgehog fused Japanese character design with US pop culture.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sega</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Launched in the US more than a year before the Super Nintendo system, the Genesis came out of nowhere to become the biggest-selling machine in the country. We look back now and it seems like Sega had preternatural confidence in its vision but in fact, as is often the case in the games industry, it was winging it.</p> <p>\u201cI was just trying to establish a toehold for Genesis in the US,\u201d says Nilsen. \u201cI didn\u2019t have the software to be an aspirational machine \u2013 I launched with five titles! By 1990, I had maybe 30 titles and some third-party games. If you\u2019d asked me in 1989, \u2018Will Sega have the No 1 selling console in America?\u2019 it never even entered my mind. I shouldn\u2019t say that though, because when I was out talking to prospective partners that\u2019s exactly what I was telling them. Did I believe it? No.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was based on interviews conducted while researching the book <a href=\"https://readonlymemory.vg/shop/book/sega-mega-drive-genesis-collected-works/\">Sega Mega Drive: The Collected Works</a>, published by Read-Only Memory.</p>",

Golden Axe, Space Harrier \u2013 these were Sega classics, and the Genesis system was the first console that could bring that arcade experience home. I looked at who was playing in the arcades \u2013 and this was back in the day, when they were on every street corner \u2013 and it wasn\u2019t six to 12-year-old boys, it was teenagers and young adults. They went there because that\u2019s where the best games were. And that\u2019s also where the girls were. I said: \u2018This is my market\u2019\u201d. So Sega went straight for the teenagers with aggressive, rock music-driven, jump cut-filled TV ads, initally produced by slick PR and advertising agency Bozell, and later by Goodby, Berlin &amp; Silverstein, who masterminded the \u201cWelcome to the Next Level\u201d TV commercials and would go on to make the famed \u201cGot Milk\u201d campaign. But Katz knew if the Genesis was really going to rule in the US, it needed something else: celebrity endorsement. This became another vital focus. \u201cWhen I got to Sega, we needed hot licensed software with names that consumers would recognise,\u201d he says. \u201cIf we could get that, we\u2019d be able to compete with Nintendo. So I said let\u2019s go after personalities. Let\u2019s go after the hottest athlete in the States \u2013 that was Joe Montana \u2013 then we\u2019d extend that to boxing and everything else.\u201d The eventual result was Joe Montana Football from Electronic Arts, a huge hit that spawned several sequels. \u201cWe didn\u2019t realise we were competing with Nintendo for Montana,\u201d says Katz. \u201cWe beat them out by a couple of hundred thousand dollars, and after that I discovered I\u2019d been bidding against [Nintendo of America chairman] Howard Lincoln. That was gratifying \u2013 it signalled that we were beginning to gain traction.\u201d Also vital to the success of the Genesis was Sega of America\u2019s determination to bring US developers on to the console. There was an understanding that they wouldn\u2019t beat the Super Nintendo with arcade conversions alone \u2013 they needed local talent. So they approached US studios such as Accolade, Spectrum Holobyte and, of course, Electronic Arts to support the console. \u201cSega were always going to make a good job of bringing over their arcade games, but the total product offering was narrow,\u201d says EA founder Trip Hawkins. \u201cThe 16-bit market was new and a lot of developers had come to understand how much more they could do with it. We really pushed the envelope and explored genres that others weren\u2019t really willing to try at the time \u2013 sports simulations being the most pervasive example, but then there was true innovation. Populous invented a new genre.\u201d The Sega Genesis didn\u2019t just make games cool, it changed how consoles were marketed, and widened the scope of console game development beyond Japanese powerhouses such as Nintendo, Capcom, Konami and Taito. There was a slightly combative relationship between Sega of Japan and Sega of America, and this led to a richly creative period of development, culminating in the arrival of Sonic the Hedgehog, a Japanese character infused with the bombastic qualities of 1990s US pop culture. Launched in the US more than a year before the Super Nintendo system, the Genesis came out of nowhere to become the biggest-selling machine in the country. We look back now and it seems like Sega had preternatural confidence in its vision but in fact, as is often the case in the games industry, it was winging it. \u201cI was just trying to establish a toehold for Genesis in the US,\u201d says Nilsen. \u201cI didn\u2019t have the software to be an aspirational machine \u2013 I launched with five titles! By 1990, I had maybe 30 titles and some third-party games. If you\u2019d asked me in 1989, \u2018Will Sega have the No 1 selling console in America?\u2019 it never even entered my mind. I shouldn\u2019t say that though, because when I was out talking to prospective partners that\u2019s exactly what I was telling them. Did I believe it? No.\u201d \u2022 This article was based on interviews conducted while researching the book Sega Mega Drive: The Collected Works, published by Read-Only Memory.",

It is also one of the most impressively silent. Lars von Trier\u2019s 1996 breakthrough portrays an insular Hebridean community that is fiercely defensive of its values in the face of incomers and offshore oil development. The elders wield religious dogma in an attempt to protect a young woman, Bess McNeill, but their efforts pivot into tyranny and their fear turns xenophobic.</p> <p>Bess, played with galling vividness by Emily Watson, marries an oil worker called Jan. He becomes paralysed after an accident on the rig and instructs Bess to keep their relationship alive by having sex with other men and then telling him about it. Von Trier shows it all in bleak, intimate and savagely quiet detail. With the exception of chapter interludes charged with 1970s rock (Procol Harum, Roxy Music, Elton John), there is no music underscoring the austere camerawork. We feel the silent scrutiny of an island that has no bells in its church steeple: the elders removed them, believing them a distraction from God.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c2f1fa72e0894a308ccfc48ecee4fd0a68a8e277\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2f1fa72e0894a308ccfc48ecee4fd0a68a8e277/0_317_1880_2348/801.jpg\" alt=\"Emily Watson in Breaking the Waves (1996).\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emily Watson as Bess in Lars von Trier\u2019s 1996 film. \u2018Everyone around her is telling her what to do and how to act.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/October Films/Sportsphoto Ltd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What happens when you add sound to such formidably oppressive filmic hush? The New York composer <a href=\"http://www.missymazzoli.com/\" title=\"\">Missy Mazzoli</a> has spent years grappling with that question. \u201cBack in 2013,\u201d she says, \u201cmy librettist, Royce Vavrek, suggested making an opera out of Breaking the Waves. I said absolutely not: I thought the film was untouchable. But it was a question that wouldn\u2019t leave me alone. The film deals with big ideas about the nature of loyalty, the nature of faith. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/opera\" title=\"\">Opera</a> is a place for big ideas.\u201d</p> <p>We are speaking at the rehearsal studios of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/scottish-opera\" title=\"\">Scottish Opera</a>, whose new production of Mazzoli\u2019s acclaimed work opens in Edinburgh next week. The film is actually packed with classic operatic trademarks. The devoted, mistreated woman \u2013 a fixture of Donizetti, Verdi and Puccini. The woman who sacrifices herself for the salvation of a man \u2013 Wagner\u2019s redemptive heroines. The seething small-community groupthink to a backdrop of menacing, hallowed seascapes \u2013 think Peter Grimes. Mazzoli recognises the weight of that lineage but her broad, brooding post-minimalism carries it lightly.</p> <p>Mazzoli is a star of the US contemporary classical mainstream. She plays in the Brooklyn band <a href=\"http://www.victoiremusic.com/\" title=\"\">Victoire</a>, which she founded to champion her own work, and is composer-in-residence with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. She studied with Bang on a Can co-founder <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/18/facing-the-music-composer-david-lang\" title=\"\">David Lang</a>, and shares his knack for lushness cut with sparsity, propulsion studded with unmissable emotive triggers. She tells me that opera thrills her most \u2013 that she always wrote instrumental music in a dramatic way, \u201cthinking of instruments as characters, sometimes in opposition to each other, sometimes together, but always with personality. So the leap to opera was natural. It felt like something I\u2019d been waiting for, nothing short of meeting my destiny.\u201d</p> <p>When Opera Philadelphia commissioned Breaking the Waves for its 2016 season, she took a trip to Scotland with Vavrek. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know why it was important until we got here and immersed ourselves in the Isle of Skye,\u201d she says. \u201cIt overtook me like waves.\u201d Von Trier shot much of his film on Skye, though his setting is an invention: there are no oil rigs on the Scottish west coast, but the religion of the film points to the Hebrides.</p> <p>For Mazzoli, that sense of place is key. References to Skye are, she says, \u201cdelicious in the music\u201d. Her ears pricked up at the accents \u2013 \u201ca gift for vocal lines! This one man spoke about being \u2018hefted to the hill\u2019. I could hear the music of that phrase instantly.\u201d She also asked locals about their experience of Scottish Free Presbyterianism in the 70s. One woman recalled the walk to church every Sunday, with the whole village noting who did or did not attend.</p> <p>Above all, Mazzoli\u2019s creative mind was set racing by the landscape. \u201cRare for me,\u201d she admits. \u201cNinety-nine percent of my work is inspired by human drama, the inner life of interesting people. But the very first chord in the opera is a direct response to a place called <a href=\"https://forkandfoot.com/brothers-point-isle-skye/\" title=\"\">The Brother\u2019s Point</a>. A lush meadow, sheep grazing, then a sharp point dropping off into a cliff and waves crashing. That combination of soft and rough \u2013 it\u2019s a landscape that\u2019s almost sexy in its lushness. I knew the music had to start like that. The vibe of it was crystal clear.\u201d</p> <p>She is nervous about bringing the opera to Scotland \u2013 \u201cThere\u2019s nothing worse than an American telling people what their country is like\u201d \u2013 and stresses that although the music is thick with Hebridean atmosphere, it is not a portrait of anywhere. \u201cIn portraying the religious men, we\u2019re not making a statement about the men of Skye. We\u2019re making a statement about the patriarchy of religion.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e7c7b9b5feb908994e76c0c8872b1eaf7cc77236\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7c7b9b5feb908994e76c0c8872b1eaf7cc77236/0_197_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rehearsals for the upcoming Scottish Opera production.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rehearsals for the upcoming Scottish Opera production. \u2018It has to be a true love story.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julie Howden/Scottish Opera</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Not for the last time, Von Trier\u2019s film attracted controversy for its extreme scenes of humiliating sex and female debasement. Does Bess suffer for the benefit of Jan\u2019s fantasies and \u2013 ultimately \u2013 for our entertainment? Mazzoli doesn\u2019t see it that way. \u201cA lot of people talk about his treatment of actresses. I\u2019m not interested in that. I\u2019ve never met the man. The point for me is that I don\u2019t think this film is misogynist. There\u2019s an interesting ambiguity in Jan\u2019s motivations but I believe his motivation is pure. It has to be a true love story.\u201d</p> <p>Mazzoli says she has not written a feminist opera \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s preoccupied with other themes\u201d \u2013 but describes it as the story of a woman \u201cin an impossible situation. Everyone around her is telling her what to do and how to act. And they\u2019re all telling her contradictory things. They\u2019re punishing her for falling off the line of acceptable behaviour, which in reality is impossibly thin. As a woman, I can definitely relate to that. It\u2019s how I feel, and to a greater extent how all the older women in my family have felt. The old madonna/whore thing: you\u2019re supposed to be pure, but you\u2019re also supposed to please men through your body. You can\u2019t win because you\u2019re either a slut or a prude. You\u2019re constantly falling on either side of the line.\u201d</p> <p>Von Trier called it a story about goodness \u2013 what can go wrong even when everyone tries to act in a way they believe to be right. Watching the film, it is hard to feel compassion towards the elders of the community \u2013 and that is where Mazzoli hopes her music can contribute nuance. While the church councilman berates Bess with cruel words, Mazzoli writes him lush cascading lines. \u201cI can shade every word in one direction or the other. It\u2019s why I love opera. I can contradict what\u2019s assumed.\u201d</p> <p>Above all, her music lets us into Bess\u2019s head. More than that: in a sense, Bess conjures the whole opera. Her community is silent, but she loves music. \u201cMaybe she <em>is</em> music,\u201d Mazzoli suggests.

      "bodyText": "Breaking the Waves is one of the most brutal, probing and provocative films ever made about Scotland. It is also one of the most impressively silent. Lars von Trier\u2019s 1996 breakthrough portrays an insular Hebridean community that is fiercely defensive of its values in the face of incomers and offshore oil development. The elders wield religious dogma in an attempt to protect a young woman, Bess McNeill, but their efforts pivot into tyranny and their fear turns xenophobic. Bess, played with galling vividness by Emily Watson, marries an oil worker called Jan. He becomes paralysed after an accident on the rig and instructs Bess to keep their relationship alive by having sex with other men and then telling him about it. Von Trier shows it all in bleak, intimate and savagely quiet detail. With the exception of chapter interludes charged with 1970s rock (Procol Harum, Roxy Music, Elton John), there is no music underscoring the austere camerawork. We feel the silent scrutiny of an island that has no bells in its church steeple: the elders removed them, believing them a distraction from God. What happens when you add sound to such formidably oppressive filmic hush? The New York composer Missy Mazzoli has spent years grappling with that question. \u201cBack in 2013,\u201d she says, \u201cmy librettist, Royce Vavrek, suggested making an opera out of Breaking the Waves. I said absolutely not: I thought the film was untouchable. But it was a question that wouldn\u2019t leave me alone. The film deals with big ideas about the nature of loyalty, the nature of faith. Opera is a place for big ideas.\u201d We are speaking at the rehearsal studios of Scottish Opera, whose new production of Mazzoli\u2019s acclaimed work opens in Edinburgh next week. The film is actually packed with classic operatic trademarks. The devoted, mistreated woman \u2013 a fixture of Donizetti, Verdi and Puccini. The woman who sacrifices herself for the salvation of a man \u2013 Wagner\u2019s redemptive heroines. The seething small-community groupthink to a backdrop of menacing, hallowed seascapes \u2013 think Peter Grimes. Mazzoli recognises the weight of that lineage but her broad, brooding post-minimalism carries it lightly. Mazzoli is a star of the US contemporary classical mainstream. She plays in the Brooklyn band Victoire, which she founded to champion her own work, and is composer-in-residence with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. She studied with Bang on a Can co-founder David Lang, and shares his knack for lushness cut with sparsity, propulsion studded with unmissable emotive triggers. She tells me that opera thrills her most \u2013 that she always wrote instrumental music in a dramatic way, \u201cthinking of instruments as characters, sometimes in opposition to each other, sometimes together, but always with personality. So the leap to opera was natural. It felt like something I\u2019d been waiting for, nothing short of meeting my destiny.\u201d When Opera Philadelphia commissioned Breaking the Waves for its 2016 season, she took a trip to Scotland with Vavrek. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know why it was important until we got here and immersed ourselves in the Isle of Skye,\u201d she says. \u201cIt overtook me like waves.\u201d Von Trier shot much of his film on Skye, though his setting is an invention: there are no oil rigs on the Scottish west coast, but the religion of the film points to the Hebrides. For Mazzoli, that sense of place is key. References to Skye are, she says, \u201cdelicious in the music\u201d. Her ears pricked up at the accents \u2013 \u201ca gift for vocal lines! This one man spoke about being \u2018hefted to the hill\u2019. I could hear the music of that phrase instantly.\u201d She also asked locals about their experience of Scottish Free Presbyterianism in the 70s. One woman recalled the walk to church every Sunday, with the whole village noting who did or did not attend. Above all, Mazzoli\u2019s creative mind was set racing by the landscape. \u201cRare for me,\u201d she admits. \u201cNinety-nine percent of my work is inspired by human drama, the inner life of interesting people. But the very first chord in the opera is a direct response to a place called The Brother\u2019s Point. A lush meadow, sheep grazing, then a sharp point dropping off into a cliff and waves crashing. That combination of soft and rough \u2013 it\u2019s a landscape that\u2019s almost sexy in its lushness. I knew the music had to start like that. The vibe of it was crystal clear.\u201d She is nervous about bringing the opera to Scotland \u2013 \u201cThere\u2019s nothing worse than an American telling people what their country is like\u201d \u2013 and stresses that although the music is thick with Hebridean atmosphere, it is not a portrait of anywhere. \u201cIn portraying the religious men, we\u2019re not making a statement about the men of Skye. We\u2019re making a statement about the patriarchy of religion.\u201d Not for the last time, Von Trier\u2019s film attracted controversy for its extreme scenes of humiliating sex and female debasement. Does Bess suffer for the benefit of Jan\u2019s fantasies and \u2013 ultimately \u2013 for our entertainment? Mazzoli doesn\u2019t see it that way. \u201cA lot of people talk about his treatment of actresses. I\u2019m not interested in that. I\u2019ve never met the man. The point for me is that I don\u2019t think this film is misogynist. There\u2019s an interesting ambiguity in Jan\u2019s motivations but I believe his motivation is pure. It has to be a true love story.\u201d Mazzoli says she has not written a feminist opera \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s preoccupied with other themes\u201d \u2013 but describes it as the story of a woman \u201cin an impossible situation. Everyone around her is telling her what to do and how to act. And they\u2019re all telling her contradictory things. They\u2019re punishing her for falling off the line of acceptable behaviour, which in reality is impossibly thin. As a woman, I can definitely relate to that. It\u2019s how I feel, and to a greater extent how all the older women in my family have felt. The old madonna/whore thing: you\u2019re supposed to be pure, but you\u2019re also supposed to please men through your body. You can\u2019t win because you\u2019re either a slut or a prude. You\u2019re constantly falling on either side of the line.\u201d Von Trier called it a story about goodness \u2013 what can go wrong even when everyone tries to act in a way they believe to be right. Watching the film, it is hard to feel compassion towards the elders of the community \u2013 and that is where Mazzoli hopes her music can contribute nuance. While the church councilman berates Bess with cruel words, Mazzoli writes him lush cascading lines. \u201cI can shade every word in one direction or the other. It\u2019s why I love opera. I can contradict what\u2019s assumed.\u201d Above all, her music lets us into Bess\u2019s head. More than that: in a sense, Bess conjures the whole opera. Her community is silent, but she loves music. \u201cMaybe she is music,\u201d Mazzoli suggests. So while we might expect those rough waves and gentle meadows to come from the orchestra, instead Mazzoli gives us a sumptuous electronic soundscape that emerges from the ether. It is as if we are hearing Bess\u2019s unbridled imagination, and only when the music spills into the pit and is taken up by the instruments do we come crashing down to earth. It is a tremendously powerful idea \u2013 an operatically transfigurative idea \u2013 as if the entire work, the entire genre, becomes the spirit Bess can\u2019t set free in the film. If ever Mazzoli was concerned about what opera might add to Von Trier\u2019s supernatural epic, here is the answer. \u2022Breaking the Waves is at the King\u2019s Theatre, Edinburgh, 21-24 August, part of Edinburgh international festival.",

Beiles was to read an anti-nuclear manifesto, but fell to the ground after the first sentence: \u201cI am a sculpture.\u201d According to the critic Guy Brett, the performance \u201crepresented a kind of collision between three worlds: the world of art, that of science and contemporary reality\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3e2ce1f6a82a8b7949cb5e59b8c57af840f278c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e2ce1f6a82a8b7949cb5e59b8c57af840f278c7/0_246_5583_6979/800.jpg\" alt=\"The 1969 Magnetic Field installation at Tate Modern, London, as part of an exhibition of Takis\u2019s work.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The 1969 Magnetic Field installation at Tate Modern, London, as part of an exhibition of Takis\u2019s work.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allison Chipak/Takis \u00a9 ADAGP Paris and DACS London</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Born Panayiotis Vassilakis in Athens, Takis was the sixth of seven children of Alexandra (nee Leontaritsou) and Athanasios Vassilakis. His father had ran a successful property empire but the fortune was lost during the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Greco-Turkish-wars\" title=\"\">Greco-Turkish war</a>. In 1942, as the Axis occupation solidified in Greece, the 17-year-old joined the resistance movement the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Republican_Greek_League\" title=\"\">National Republican Greek League</a>, or EDES. After a year a rival resistance group, the more radical <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_People%27s_Liberation_Army\" title=\"\">Greek People\u2019s Liberation Army</a> (ELAS) enlisted Takis to spy on EDES. By 1945 he had publicly switched sides to ELAS, to become a leader in its youth wing, which, as Greece fell into civil war, earned him a six-month prison sentence.</p> <p>On release, with little in the way of formal education, Takis made his first artwork, two busts, inspired by seeing sculptures by Picasso and Giacometti at the American Cultural Center in Athens in 1951. As he fell into artistic circles, the political turmoil of Greece became increasingly frustrating to Takis: while his work, at this point derivative of Giacometti, was beginning to be exhibited, by 1953 he had had enough. \u201cGreece is a prison,\u201d he complained. With the help of the art patron <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/25/caresse-crosby-paris-society-1920s-hemingway-heart-is-a-burial-ground\" title=\"\">Caresse Crosby</a>, who was a regular visitor to Greece, Takis left for Paris.</p> <p>Living in hotels in Montparnasse, he briefly joined the studio of the modernist sculptor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2004/jan/03/1\" title=\"\">Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i</a>, but gained more practical experience at a blacksmiths. His 1955 exhibition at Hanover Gallery in London was characterised by featureless iron and plaster figures. Soon after, he started to hang around the <a href=\"https://www.literarytraveler.com/hotels/the-beat-hotel-american-writers-in-paris-1957-1963/\" title=\"\">Beat Hotel on Rue G\u00eet-le-C\u0153ur </a>and became friends with Burroughs and <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-allen-ginsberg-1265816.html\" title=\"\">Allen Ginsberg</a>, as well as making his first T\u00e9l\u00e9sculptures. In 1961 the Greek dealer <a href=\"http://www.greece-is.com/alexander-iolas-greek-shaped-20th-century-art/\" title=\"\">Alexander Iolas</a> gave him a solo exhibition in New York.

He showed at the gallery later that year. In 1966 he had a show at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2006/nov/05/art1\" title=\"\">Indica</a>, in Mayfair, from which John Lennon bought a sculpture. Takis became friendly with the Beatles and Yoko Ono, but by the end of the decade had settled largely in the US, where he was a visiting researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. There he began creating work using hydromagnetic force, inspired by \u201cthe perpetual moving bicycle wheel of Marcel Duchamp\u201d.</p> <p>In 1969 MoMA included a T\u00e9l\u00e9sculpture in a group exhibition without the artist\u2019s permission. Takis\u2019s reaction was typically bullish \u2013 he stormed the New York museum and removed the work. It was an action that led, a year later, to the formation of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Workers%27_Coalition\" title=\"\">Art Workers\u2019 Coalition</a>.</p> <p>From the 70s onwards Takis began making his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBK_m68TVf0\" title=\"\">Sculptures Musicales</a>, in which an electromagnet hidden behind a wooden panel attracted and repelled a needle which, in turn, struck a metal string. Over the decades, as well as regular shows in major institutions, and many public commissions, he began to move into set design and music composition for film and theatre.</p> <p>In 1995, having moved back to Greece, and set up the <a href=\"https://takisfoundation.org/\" title=\"\">Takis Foundation</a> there, the artist was asked to represent his country at the Venice Biennale.

An early version of his Sculptures T\u00e9l\u00e9magn\u00e9tiques, or T\u00e9l\u00e9sculptures, featured a nail suspended in mid-air by a magnet. In Magnetic Fields (1969), currently part of an exhibition of the artist\u2019s work at Tate Modern in London, a pendulum swung by a gallery attendant sets off a wave of movement through a forest of floor-standing metal rods. An argument in the late 1950s with Yves Klein over the French artist\u2019s attempt to patent the use of magnets led to Takis staging The Impossible \u2013 Man in Space, at Galerie Iris Clert, in Paris. The performance involved a powerful magnet that suspended the South African poet Sinclair Beiles in mid-air. Beiles was to read an anti-nuclear manifesto, but fell to the ground after the first sentence: \u201cI am a sculpture.\u201d According to the critic Guy Brett, the performance \u201crepresented a kind of collision between three worlds: the world of art, that of science and contemporary reality\u201d. Born Panayiotis Vassilakis in Athens, Takis was the sixth of seven children of Alexandra (nee Leontaritsou) and Athanasios Vassilakis. His father had ran a successful property empire but the fortune was lost during the Greco-Turkish war. In 1942, as the Axis occupation solidified in Greece, the 17-year-old joined the resistance movement the National Republican Greek League, or EDES. After a year a rival resistance group, the more radical Greek People\u2019s Liberation Army (ELAS) enlisted Takis to spy on EDES. By 1945 he had publicly switched sides to ELAS, to become a leader in its youth wing, which, as Greece fell into civil war, earned him a six-month prison sentence. On release, with little in the way of formal education, Takis made his first artwork, two busts, inspired by seeing sculptures by Picasso and Giacometti at the American Cultural Center in Athens in 1951. As he fell into artistic circles, the political turmoil of Greece became increasingly frustrating to Takis: while his work, at this point derivative of Giacometti, was beginning to be exhibited, by 1953 he had had enough. \u201cGreece is a prison,\u201d he complained. With the help of the art patron Caresse Crosby, who was a regular visitor to Greece, Takis left for Paris. Living in hotels in Montparnasse, he briefly joined the studio of the modernist sculptor Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i, but gained more practical experience at a blacksmiths. His 1955 exhibition at Hanover Gallery in London was characterised by featureless iron and plaster figures. Soon after, he started to hang around the Beat Hotel on Rue G\u00eet-le-C\u0153ur and became friends with Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg, as well as making his first T\u00e9l\u00e9sculptures. In 1961 the Greek dealer Alexander Iolas gave him a solo exhibition in New York. There he befriended the artist Marcel Duchamp, returning for a second show at the gallery two years later. Following his marriage to the artist Liliane Lijn, Takis moved to London in 1964, the same year that Signals Gallery opened in the West End, taking its name from Takis\u2019s work. He showed at the gallery later that year. In 1966 he had a show at Indica, in Mayfair, from which John Lennon bought a sculpture. Takis became friendly with the Beatles and Yoko Ono, but by the end of the decade had settled largely in the US, where he was a visiting researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. There he began creating work using hydromagnetic force, inspired by \u201cthe perpetual moving bicycle wheel of Marcel Duchamp\u201d. In 1969 MoMA included a T\u00e9l\u00e9sculpture in a group exhibition without the artist\u2019s permission. Takis\u2019s reaction was typically bullish \u2013 he stormed the New York museum and removed the work. It was an action that led, a year later, to the formation of the Art Workers\u2019 Coalition. From the 70s onwards Takis began making his Sculptures Musicales, in which an electromagnet hidden behind a wooden panel attracted and repelled a needle which, in turn, struck a metal string. Over the decades, as well as regular shows in major institutions, and many public commissions, he began to move into set design and music composition for film and theatre. In 1995, having moved back to Greece, and set up the Takis Foundation there, the artist was asked to represent his country at the Venice Biennale. Takis insisted on showing his work just outside the national pavilion, stating: \u201cI am a citizen of the world.\u201d He is survived by his daughter, Anna, from a relationship with the artist Sheila Fell; by his son, Thanos, from his marriage to Liliane, which ended in divorce in 1970; by three grandchildren; and by a sister, Tita. \u2022 Takis (Panayiotis Vassilakis), artist, born 29 October 1925; died 9 August 2019",

      "body": "<p>During the summer holidays, you may be heading into the British countryside for a leisurely walk. However, the idea of the rural idyll is not what you may think. Country paths are often strewn with dog poo left by irresponsible owners, litter blown into ditches or piles of flytipped rubbish. Most people who access the countryside respect it and want to look after it. After all, many of us enjoy exploring it and some of us still make our living within it. Yet, social media is awash with farmers and landowners <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheHornedBeefCo/status/1117772425176002561\" title=\"\">venting their frustration</a> at the way some people act, with gates left open and dogs allowed to run off the lead near cows and sheep.</p> <p>On my 300-hectare coastal farm in Essex I\u2019m lucky that there are quite a few regular walkers who act as our unofficial farm neighbourhood watch. They want to see the land looking good as much as I do and are the first to air their grievances to me if they find someone hasn\u2019t picked up their dog\u2019s mess or if they have come across flytipping. These people stick to public footpaths and <a href=\"https://www.essexarearamblers.co.uk/area-walks/56-footpath-information/119-permissive-paths.html\" title=\"\">permissive paths</a>, leave gates as they found them and respect others. Unfortunately, there are people who do the opposite, but it seems impossible to catch them in the act. How often have you actually seen someone leaving their dog\u2019s mess on the ground? Last week, I missed a flytipper by just 10 minutes.

      "bodyText": "During the summer holidays, you may be heading into the British countryside for a leisurely walk. However, the idea of the rural idyll is not what you may think. Country paths are often strewn with dog poo left by irresponsible owners, litter blown into ditches or piles of flytipped rubbish. Most people who access the countryside respect it and want to look after it. After all, many of us enjoy exploring it and some of us still make our living within it. Yet, social media is awash with farmers and landowners venting their frustration at the way some people act, with gates left open and dogs allowed to run off the lead near cows and sheep. On my 300-hectare coastal farm in Essex I\u2019m lucky that there are quite a few regular walkers who act as our unofficial farm neighbourhood watch. They want to see the land looking good as much as I do and are the first to air their grievances to me if they find someone hasn\u2019t picked up their dog\u2019s mess or if they have come across flytipping. These people stick to public footpaths and permissive paths, leave gates as they found them and respect others. Unfortunately, there are people who do the opposite, but it seems impossible to catch them in the act. How often have you actually seen someone leaving their dog\u2019s mess on the ground? Last week, I missed a flytipper by just 10 minutes. We need to collectively shame people, but finding them is not easy. Since 2013, we have had sheep on the farm as well as Hereford and Angus cattle during the summer. Most people aren\u2019t aware of the risks dogs pose to livestock, as well as the work created by people who leave gates open (or those who close gates that have been deliberately left open). However, we do have the Countryside Code: a set of guidelines to ensure that we can all respect and enjoy the countryside. First drawn up in the 1950s, the code is regularly updated by Natural England. A lot of the code seems common sense: respect other people, leave gates and property as you find them, follow paths unless other wider access is available, take your litter home, plan ahead and keep dogs under effective control. In almost all situations, the latter means \u201ckeep your dog on a lead\u201d. Yet dozens of farmers have told me that they have suffered as a result of dog owners believing that their pet won\u2019t act aggressively towards livestock. The risk is always there. Even if no contact is made a dog can have an impact. The problem seems to be that the consequences of ignoring the code\u2019s principles aren\u2019t taken seriously enough by people, or that they don\u2019t even know about the code. What is obvious to some people might not be clear to others, especially if you live in a town or city and have no interaction with rural dwellers and little understanding of farming practices and stewardship of the countryside. Not everyone, for instance, might know that leaving gates as you found them is vital for farmers and that any dog has the capacity to worry cows and sheep. So public education needs to greatly improve. This could involve posters highlighting the code near public footpaths, or given to farmers to place on their land. In the past there have been television adverts but perhaps targeted social media posts would have greater impact today. Car parks, bus stops and country pubs might also be other places where the code, and other advice on how to act appropriately in the countryside, could be publicised.

The person who throws litter into a hedge doesn\u2019t have to collect it later; the person who lets their dog run with sheep doesn\u2019t have the prospect of dealing with mauled carcasses and face a loss of income; the person walking through a field margin left for wildlife doesn\u2019t think about the impact this might have on, for example, ground-nesting birds.

China controls another part in the east.<br></p>\n    <p>India and Pakistan have gone to war a further two times over Kashmir, most recently in 1999. Artillery, mortar and small arms fire are still frequently exchanged.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How did the dispute start?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>After the partition of colonial India in 1947, small, semi-autonomous \u2018princely states\u2019 across the subcontinent were being folded into India or Pakistan. The ruler of Kashmir dithered over which to join until tribal fighters entered from Pakistan intent on taking the region for Islamabad.</p>\n    <p>Kashmir asked Delhi for assistance, signing a treaty of accession in exchange for the intervention of Indian troops, who fought the Pakistanis to the modern-day line of control.</p>\n    <p>In 1948, the UN security council called for a referendum in Kashmir to determine which country the region would join or whether it would become an independent state. The referendum has never been held.</p>\n    <p>In its 1950 constitution, India granted Kashmir a large measure of independence. But since then it has eroded some of that autonomy and repeatedly intervened to rig elections and dismiss and jail democratically elected leaders.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was Kashmir\u2019s special status?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Kashmir\u2019s special status, given in exchange for joining the Indian union, had been in place since 14 May 1954. Under article 370, the state was given a separate constitution, a flag, and autonomy over all matters except for foreign affairs and defence.&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p>An additional provision, article 35a, prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believed this was crucial to protecting the demography of the Muslim-majority state and its way of life.</p>\n    <p>The ruling Bharatiya Janata party repeatedly promised to scrap such rules, a long-term demand of its Hindu nationalist support base. But analysts warned doing so would almost certainly ignite unrest.</p>\n    <p>On Wednesday 31 October 2019, the government formally revoked Kashmir\u2019s special status. The government argued that the provision had&nbsp; only ever intended to be temporary and that scrapping it would boost investment in Kashmir. Critics, however, said the move would escalate tensions with Pakistan \u2013 which quickly called India\u2019s actions illegal \u2013 and fuel resentment in Kashmir, where there is an insurgency against Indian rule.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do the militants want?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule over its section of Kashmir for the past three decades. Indian soldiers and Pakistan-backed guerrillas fought a war rife with accusations of torture, forced disappearances and extra-judicial killing.<br></p>\n    <p>Until 2004, the militancy was made up largely of Pakistani and Afghan fighters. Since then, especially after protests were quashed with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/08/india-crackdown-in-kashmir-is-this-worlds-first-mass-blinding\">extreme force</a>&nbsp;in 2016, locals have made up a growing share of the anti-India fighters.</p>\n    <p>For Indians, control of Kashmir \u2013 part of the country\u2019s only Muslim-majority state \u2013 has been proof of its commitment to religious pluralism. For Pakistan, a state founded as a homeland for south Asian Muslims, it is the last occupied home of its co-religionists. <br><b><br>Michael Safi and Rebecca Ratcliffe</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>On Friday, the Jammu and Kashmir chief secretary, BVR Subrahmanyam, said \u201ca few preventive detentions\u201d of individuals had been made, \u201cin accordance with the provisions of the law\u201d.</p> \n<p>He also said restrictions on landlines would be eased over the coming days.

Restrictions on movement would be removed on an area-by-area basis, he said. On Thursday, Mufti wrote to India\u2019s home minister, Amit Shah, asking under what legal grounds she had been detained. \u201cIs it a crime to articulate the pain, torment and indignity we\u2019ve been subjected to?\u201d she wrote. Outside her home, Mufti said, a military van waits at the front gate. \u201cEvery time that I step out into the garden for fresh air there is a man who intercepts them on a walkie talkie and lets them know that I\u2019ve stepped out,\u201d she said. Three to four female officers, who she believes are there to grab her if she attempts to run, were also present. It is more than 11 days since her mother was arrested. \u201cI miss her terribly and there are times when I dream of her and imagine us in happier times.\u201d India can no longer claim to be the world\u2019s largest democracy, she said: \u201cNot after what Kashmiris have had to endure in the past two weeks.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "National Grid\u2019s first report into the causes of Britain\u2019s biggest blackout in more than a decade is expected to blame a string of avoidable faults at electricity generators, networks and rail companies. On Friday the company, which is responsible for keeping the lights on, will submit an interim report to the energy regulator detailing the cause of the widespread chaos triggered by last week\u2019s grid outage. The system operator will also face questions from the energy minister, Kwasi Kwarteng, who will visit the National Grid control room on Friday. A full report will be published in about three months. The National Grid is also facing a separate government probe by the energy emergencies executive committee. Kwarteng told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that the \u201cresilience\u201d of the energy system is more important than last week\u2019s individual power plant shutdowns in making sure that the \u201cunacceptable\u201d blackout chaos does not happen again. He said: \u201cI think it\u2019s extremely unlikely that it will happen again.\u201d The minister added that the International Energy Agency had \u201csaid that the UK has an exemplary energy network and we must make sure that what happened last week does not happen again\u201d. A National Grid spokesman declined to comment on the report findings. It is widely expected to confirm that the outage occurred during rush hour last Friday evening because of a steep drop in the grid\u2019s overall frequency \u2013 or energy intensity \u2013 which National Grid is supposed to keep at about 50Hz. The frequency fell to below 49Hz in a matter of seconds after the \u201cnear simultaneous\u201d shutdown of a gas-fired power plant, owned by the German utility RWE, and an offshore wind farm owned by the Danish energy firm \u00d8rsted because of faults with their equipment. Both companies have said relatively minor shutdowns are not uncommon. National Grid is understood to be investigating whether a lightning strike to the grid near RWE\u2019s gas plant in the Bedfordshire area could be to blame for the shutdown of the two electricity generators. A strike could, theoretically, have sent a false reading to both power generation sites causing their automatic systems to shut down as a safety precaution. \u00d8rsted said its Hornsea offshore wind farm, off the east coast of England, experienced a technical fault which caused the wind farm to shut down and pulled 800MW of electricity from the grid. It said National Grid would normally have been able to cope with a shutdown of this size. RWE said it was still investigating the shutdown of its Little Barford gas plant, which had a 730MW capacity, but believed its automatic control system \u201cdetected an abnormality and initiated a safety shutdown of the plant\u201d. A spokesman at the grid said: \u201cSuch events are not uncommon in power stations. What is now needed is for National Grid and Ofgem to investigate why the wider system issues occurred. We are very interested in the results, too.\u201d The twin shutdowns have raised questions over whether National Grid should be better prepared for near-simultaneous outages on the grid. The Guardian revealed that the system operator weathered three of its most severe frequency losses of recent years in the three months leading up to the blackout because of unexpected outages. Thomas Edwards, an analyst at energy consultancy Cornwall Insight, confirmed that experts had observed the grid\u2019s frequency fluctuations were \u201cgetting wider\u201d. He said: \u201cFrequency levels are less clustered around 50Hz compared with three years ago, and we can see a clear trend of higher volatility in the system.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Pacific island nations affected by the climate crisis will continue to survive \u201cbecause many of their workers come here to pick our fruit\u201d, Australia\u2019s deputy prime minister has said. Michael McCormack\u2019s comments were made after critical talks at the Pacific Islands Forum that almost collapsed over Australia\u2019s positions on coal and climate change. Fears are growing the situation might come at a diplomatic cost for Australia in a region where China has become increasingly influential. McCormack, who has been the acting prime minister while Scott Morrison attended the forum in low-lying Tuvalu, attended a business function in Wagga Wagga on Friday. \u201cI also get a little bit annoyed when we have people in those sorts of countries pointing the finger at Australia and say we should be shutting down all our resources sector so that, you know, they will continue to survive,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will continue to survive, there\u2019s no question they\u2019ll continue to survive and they\u2019ll continue to survive on large aid assistance from Australia. \u201cThey\u2019ll continue to survive because many of their workers come here and pick our fruit, pick our fruit grown with hard Australian enterprise and endeavour and we welcome them and we always will. \u201cBut the fact is we\u2019re not going to be hijacked into doing something that will shut down an industry that provides tens of thousands of jobs, that provides two-thirds of our energy needs ... and I\u2019m only talking coal, let alone all of our other resources.\u201d The acting opposition leader, Richard Marles, said on Friday evening: \u201cThese are ignorant comments from the acting prime minister and he should know better\u201d. On Friday afternoon, before McCormack\u2019s comments were made public, the former prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, told ABC Radio National that Australia must show respect to the Pacific and its concerns about the impact of global heating. \u201cClimate change and the consequences of it are an existential matter for the Pacific,\u201d Turnbull said. \u201cIf you are a Pacific islander and your home is going to be washed away by rising sea levels caused by global warming then this is not a political issue, it\u2019s an existential one. \u201cSo it\u2019s critically important that we show respect to the Pacific islanders and that we are seen to be helping climate change, both in reducing our emissions as part of a global effort, and of course as we do providing them with substantial resources to adapt to climate change.\u201d McCormack\u2019s comments were made in response to a question from Trudi Beck, a local general practitioner who has been campaigning in Wagga Wagga for action on climate change. Beck\u2019s Friday protests, on the lawn outside McCormack\u2019s electorate office, have become increasingly prominent. Last month, Guardian Australia reported comments McCormack made to Beck disputing evidence of global heating. Beck questioned McCormack at the function on Friday and said she felt \u201cembarrassed\u201d by Australia\u2019s lack of urgency during Pacific talks. \u201cI\u2019ve never been embarrassed to be Australian and I never will,\u201d McCormack responded. \u201cI\u2019m proud of the fact that we\u2019ve just given another $500m to our Pacific island neighbour friends. \u201cThe fact is we went to our election with our policies writ large. So we will put our policies in place. What we won\u2019t do is we won\u2019t listen to the Bob Browns of the world and say we should be shutting down our resources sector.

      "body": "<p>\u2018You can hit people,\u201d says Timmy Creed, reassuringly, as he swings his hurling stick inches from my head. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re going for the ball, you can do what you want.\u201d Creed is teaching me how to use a \u201churley\u201d properly. Not because I\u2019m considering a switch into the world of gaelic sports (my inability to hold the stick correctly put paid to that idea, along with the fact that I\u2019m a total wimp who hates getting hurt) but because he\u2019s promoting his new play, <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/spliced\">Spliced</a>. It\u2019s about hurling, the Irish sport Creed spent much of his teens and 20s playing to an impressively high club level. But it\u2019s also about more than that \u2013 masculinity, peer pressure, body image, conformity, feminism and self-discovery.</p> \n<p>Creed thinks it will help the interview if we knock a hurling ball around to get a feel for the game. (The play is normally staged outdoors, in one of Ireland\u2019s numerous handball alleys, although for its run in Edinburgh a squash court will suffice.) Mercifully, he plays gentle with me as he explains his love-hate relationship with the sport that moulded him. \u201cIt gave me an identity,\u201d he says. \u201cBut that identity shapes the way you are with men, with women, with how you see the world. A whole other side to you gets missed.\u201d</p> \n<p>Creed was a shy, skinny boy growing up \u2013 and not very good at hurling. But the sport helped him connect with other boys so he stuck at it, practising alone until he\u2019d gained the respect of his manager and teammates. His club, Bishopstown in Cork, became highly successful for their age group, winning the county championship every year, turning the players into local celebrities.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou get a swagger,\u201d says Creed. \u201cYou are the chosen ones of the area and you can behave how you want. In school, we were given special treatment because we were the stars. You could see how other guys were like, \u2018Why does he not have to do his homework?\u2019\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e45d95f6107b183bb79fb2aa6a80e1994270c51e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e45d95f6107b183bb79fb2aa6a80e1994270c51e/486_1370_2898_3622/800.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018It\u2019s so beautiful to play\u2019 \u2026 Creed.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It\u2019s so beautiful to play\u2019 \u2026 Creed.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Yet success came with huge pressure to remain committed. Weekends away from training, or even just an interest in other pastimes, was deemed to be letting the team down. He couldn\u2019t even turn up for training on his skateboard. The camaraderie had an unpleasant side, too. Was his own behaviour regrettable?</p> \n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he says, pausing to reflect. \u201cThe way I used to pursue women, or the way I <em>thought</em> was the way to do it. It was never anything too offensive, but it was never about finding an emotional connection, which is what I strive for most now.\u201d</p> \n<p>While playing, Creed started to realise that the male behaviour we often hear about as \u201ctoxic\u201d was a mindset drilled into boys across Ireland from a terrifyingly young age. \u201cWe were being educated, within this group, that this was how you behaved. Nobody taught us otherwise. So if someone is talking about a woman in a derogatory way and you\u2019re the person who calls them out, it would have been, \u2018Who are you of a sudden, undermining the way we\u2019ve been?\u2019 The behaviour comes from a conditioning that the boy won\u2019t even be aware of. It takes a lot of time to unpack that and say, \u2018What was I doing at this age?\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>It\u2019s behaviour he doesn\u2019t shy away from in the play, and the honesty can be bracing. As one line about the macho mindset goes: \u201cGet her home, get her showered, get her fingered, get her bucked. Send her packing. Walk of shame. Fuck the name. Tell the tale. Make em laugh. Have the craic. GO ON THE LADS!!\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I was bricking myself when we performed it at the club \u2013 but some of the guys came up to me with tears in their eyes</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Creed struggled mentally after quitting the sport, and says he had to piece himself back together. The way forward came via a lucky break \u2013 he put himself up for a role in the Irish film <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1608782/\">My Brothers</a> and ended up getting the lead. \u201cThey wanted an \u2018introspective, troubled-looking newcomer\u2019,\u201d he says, laughing at the perfection of the fit. The experience showed him another life was possible and, when the time came to write his own play, he knew what it had to be about.</p> \n<p>Spliced \u2013 named after the metal band that holds a hurley together \u2013 tells his own story, with the first half dedicated to the thrill of the sport, and the second his disillusionment, self-discovery and redemption. To write it, Creed went method, re-enrolling at his old hurling team after a seven-year hiatus. \u201cI felt like I was a spy infiltrating the IRA,\u201d he says. \u201cI was seeing the culture that moulded me from a new perspective.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"78adf7a8-43b9-487c-bf2e-3087ad01787e\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div

But \u2018toxic\u2019 is such a strong word. People hear it and their initial response is \u2018That\u2019s not me\u2019 or \u2018I don\u2019t even want the conversation if you\u2019re calling me that.\u2019 It excludes men from this big conversation of openness and respect for women. Can\u2019t we bring them in to share their experience?\u201d</p> \n<p>One of the most important moments in Creed\u2019s life came when he took the play to the club to perform it in front of the players. \u201cI was bricking myself,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause I was using some of the material I\u2019d got from going back.\u201d But the reaction astounded him. \u201cSome of the guys \u2013 big, strong-on-the-outside players who dedicated their lives to this sport \u2013 came up to me with tears in their eyes, saying thank you so much for articulating something we all struggle with but have never said. They weren\u2019t used to watching theatre and not so versed in how to respond \u2013 instead their responses were so honest and simple, cutting through to the core. It was really beautiful.\u201d</p> \n<p>Were people not angry that he had been acting undercover? \u201cSome people were, like, \u2018Who does he think he is?\u2019 But we can\u2019t hide away from these things. I wanted to crack it open and see how people react.\u201d</p> \n<p>Creed is thankful for many things hurling has given him. After he performed, the club chairman said to him: \u201cIf this game gave you nothing else, it\u2019s helped you stand up in front of your teammates and tell your own story.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd it did,\u201d says Creed. \u201cIt taught me courage.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 Spliced is at <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/spliced\">Edinburgh Sports Club</a> until 25 August.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u2018You can hit people,\u201d says Timmy Creed, reassuringly, as he swings his hurling stick inches from my head. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re going for the ball, you can do what you want.\u201d Creed is teaching me how to use a \u201churley\u201d properly. Not because I\u2019m considering a switch into the world of gaelic sports (my inability to hold the stick correctly put paid to that idea, along with the fact that I\u2019m a total wimp who hates getting hurt) but because he\u2019s promoting his new play, Spliced. It\u2019s about hurling, the Irish sport Creed spent much of his teens and 20s playing to an impressively high club level. But it\u2019s also about more than that \u2013 masculinity, peer pressure, body image, conformity, feminism and self-discovery. Creed thinks it will help the interview if we knock a hurling ball around to get a feel for the game. (The play is normally staged outdoors, in one of Ireland\u2019s numerous handball alleys, although for its run in Edinburgh a squash court will suffice.) Mercifully, he plays gentle with me as he explains his love-hate relationship with the sport that moulded him. \u201cIt gave me an identity,\u201d he says. \u201cBut that identity shapes the way you are with men, with women, with how you see the world. A whole other side to you gets missed.\u201d Creed was a shy, skinny boy growing up \u2013 and not very good at hurling. But the sport helped him connect with other boys so he stuck at it, practising alone until he\u2019d gained the respect of his manager and teammates. His club, Bishopstown in Cork, became highly successful for their age group, winning the county championship every year, turning the players into local celebrities. \u201cYou get a swagger,\u201d says Creed. \u201cYou are the chosen ones of the area and you can behave how you want. In school, we were given special treatment because we were the stars. You could see how other guys were like, \u2018Why does he not have to do his homework?\u2019\u201d Yet success came with huge pressure to remain committed. Weekends away from training, or even just an interest in other pastimes, was deemed to be letting the team down. He couldn\u2019t even turn up for training on his skateboard. The camaraderie had an unpleasant side, too. Was his own behaviour regrettable? \u201cYeah,\u201d he says, pausing to reflect. \u201cThe way I used to pursue women, or the way I thought was the way to do it. It was never anything too offensive, but it was never about finding an emotional connection, which is what I strive for most now.\u201d While playing, Creed started to realise that the male behaviour we often hear about as \u201ctoxic\u201d was a mindset drilled into boys across Ireland from a terrifyingly young age. \u201cWe were being educated, within this group, that this was how you behaved. Nobody taught us otherwise. So if someone is talking about a woman in a derogatory way and you\u2019re the person who calls them out, it would have been, \u2018Who are you of a sudden, undermining the way we\u2019ve been?\u2019 The behaviour comes from a conditioning that the boy won\u2019t even be aware of. It takes a lot of time to unpack that and say, \u2018What was I doing at this age?\u2019\u201d It\u2019s behaviour he doesn\u2019t shy away from in the play, and the honesty can be bracing. As one line about the macho mindset goes: \u201cGet her home, get her showered, get her fingered, get her bucked. Send her packing. Walk of shame. Fuck the name. Tell the tale. Make em laugh. Have the craic. GO ON THE LADS!!\u201d Creed struggled mentally after quitting the sport, and says he had to piece himself back together. The way forward came via a lucky break \u2013 he put himself up for a role in the Irish film My Brothers and ended up getting the lead. \u201cThey wanted an \u2018introspective, troubled-looking newcomer\u2019,\u201d he says, laughing at the perfection of the fit. The experience showed him another life was possible and, when the time came to write his own play, he knew what it had to be about. Spliced \u2013 named after the metal band that holds a hurley together \u2013 tells his own story, with the first half dedicated to the thrill of the sport, and the second his disillusionment, self-discovery and redemption. To write it, Creed went method, re-enrolling at his old hurling team after a seven-year hiatus. \u201cI felt like I was a spy infiltrating the IRA,\u201d he says. \u201cI was seeing the culture that moulded me from a new perspective.\u201d His return aroused many negative feelings: on his first night of training, the coach sized up his puny calf muscles and prescribed a weights and protein programme. But more complicated was the fact that he found himself falling in love with the game again. \u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful to play,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s this deep connection to the ground and ancient Ireland.\u201d Creed found himself slowly being sucked back into his previous way of life. \u201cI remember thinking, \u2018Jesus, you do all this work on yourself to unpack these things \u2013 but you can just as easily slip back into them.\u2019\u201d Then he broke his hand and was forced to retire for good. It\u2019s Creed\u2019s insider position, and genuine love of the sport, that gives him a credibility when discussing how we can tackle some of masculinity\u2019s less appealing aspects. \u201cA lot of people say to me you have to call out toxic masculinity. But \u2018toxic\u2019 is such a strong word. People hear it and their initial response is \u2018That\u2019s not me\u2019 or \u2018I don\u2019t even want the conversation if you\u2019re calling me that.\u2019 It excludes men from this big conversation of openness and respect for women. Can\u2019t we bring them in to share their experience?\u201d One of the most important moments in Creed\u2019s life came when he took the play to the club to perform it in front of the players. \u201cI was bricking myself,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause I was using some of the material I\u2019d got from going back.\u201d But the reaction astounded him. \u201cSome of the guys \u2013 big, strong-on-the-outside players who dedicated their lives to this sport \u2013 came up to me with tears in their eyes, saying thank you so much for articulating something we all struggle with but have never said. They weren\u2019t used to watching theatre and not so versed in how to respond \u2013 instead their responses were so honest and simple, cutting through to the core. It was really beautiful.\u201d Were people not angry that he had been acting undercover? \u201cSome people were, like, \u2018Who does he think he is?\u2019 But we can\u2019t hide away from these things. I wanted to crack it open and see how people react.\u201d Creed is thankful for many things hurling has given him. After he performed, the club chairman said to him: \u201cIf this game gave you nothing else, it\u2019s helped you stand up in front of your teammates and tell your own story.\u201d \u201cAnd it did,\u201d says Creed. \u201cIt taught me courage.\u201d \u2022 Spliced is at Edinburgh Sports Club until 25 August.",

      "body": "<p>We laughed, we foodie types, when we heard about <a href=\"https://www.parrillan.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Parrillan</a>, the outdoor, \u201ccook your own dinner\u201d restaurant opening in <a href=\"https://www.coaldropsyard.com/\" title=\"\">Coal Drops Yard</a>, in London\u2019s King\u2019s Cross.</p> <p>Well, we\u2019re not laughing now, are we? OK, we are a bit. But that isn\u2019t to say that Parrillan, by the Hart brothers, creators of <a href=\"https://www.barrafina.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Barrafina</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tacoselpastor.co.uk/\" title=\"\">El Pastor</a>, is a terrible idea. For what is nicer than barbecuing exemplary produce on a charcoal grill in the great outdoors? No. It\u2019s merely a peculiar idea.</p> <p>Parrillan relies on proper summers, balmy nights and a lack of sideways sleet. Powerful heaters are perched beside every table, to err on the safe side. It is apparently modelled on the Ibizan restaurant <a href=\"http://asadorcanpilot.com/\" title=\"\">Ca\u2019n Pilot</a>, and serves impeccable meats and shellfish \u2013 50-day-aged rump steak, diver-caught scallops, milk-fed lamb\u2019s kidney \u2013 all raw, and all at premium prices, then asks you to grill them yourself on your own personal mini grill in the centre of each table. They come with four house sauces: mojo verdo, mojo rojo, salsa ibizenca and, my favourite, a rich, red, almond-based romesco.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Parillan isn't a terrible idea. It\u2019s merely a peculiar idea.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The whole process is a little fondue-ish, a little Korean barbecue-esque. I\u2019m not sure I wholly approve, but here we are. The hospitality landscape weaves ever more away from the essence of actually being hospitable: app-based ordering, collecting your own food while brandishing a buzzer, queueing for your own drinks, clearing your own plates. Parrillan smashes this out of the park with \u201cBe your own chef\u201d.</p> <p>Literally. Take the middlewhite pork collar (at \u00a311 for just a few slices), arrange it on the grill with pretty tongs, sear it yourself, judge when it\u2019s cooked, then plate up.</p> <p>By 2025, I\u2019ll be showing up at restaurants with a stash of Finish Quantum tablets in my bag and loading the dishwasher. \u201cDarling, let\u2019s not take the Magimix out on the town with us again,\u201d Charles will sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s heavy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut, sweetheart,\u201d I\u2019ll huff, \u201cI want a pudding.

As the aroma of top-grade red carabiniero prawns and Iberican pork sweetbreads sizzling on numerous open grills drifts across Coal Drops Yard, the effect is marked. Faces pop up at the side of the cordoned-off area of the outside restaurant terrace like curious meerkats, wowing as plates of Cantabrian anchovies \u2013 those very good ones, like unforgettable, caramel-coloured wonders \u2013 and pan con tomate (thankfully already prepared) are shipped to our table, alongside plates of <a href=\"https://www.finefoodspecialist.co.uk/iberico-pork-presa-frozen-1-kg/\" title=\"\">presa Iberica de Bellota</a> and escalivada (roast aubergines, tomatoes and peppers drenched in excellent olive oil).</p> <p>We eat, ploughing through money like Aristotle Onassis and Maria Callas anchored off the shore of Antibes: \u00a312 for those anchovies, \u00a314 for shu-toro marinaded tuna, a single scallop at nine quid.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"98f056d90d17c3d6803f535645d2b588137a3187\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98f056d90d17c3d6803f535645d2b588137a3187/0_0_4821_3679/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Patatas panadera, at Parillan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"763\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Patatas panadera at Parillan, London N1.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Robinson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We drink a jug of sangria blanca (albari\u00f1o, brandy, apple juice, grapefruit juice, lemon) while trays of enormo Spanish Xoriguer gin and tonics seem in constant transportation to the other diners.</p> <p>Within 10 minutes, I grow weary of the responsibility of grilling my own lunch, but the men at my table are delighted by the task.</p> <p>Personally, I find the grill a positive boon for obscuring dishes one hopes not to share, such as the patatas panadera (one large spud, chopped, roasted with oil, in a bowl. Very delicious. Five pounds, thank you).</p> <p>Still, there\u2019s no doubt that whatever is occurring \u201cinside\u201d Parrillan seems alluring to everyone outside.</p> <p>Parrillan is a wholly convivial experience. It is sexy and European in a way we\u2019ve decided we\u2019ll have no more of over here soon. Perhaps Parrillan will keep the grills after October, when those Cantabrian anchovies may dry up and we can make Heinz baked bean toasties on them instead.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f8d0ae6ca367dbda095969f9e41fa37512e34227\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8d0ae6ca367dbda095969f9e41fa37512e34227/0_0_5278_3538/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tarta di casa.

      "bodyText": "We laughed, we foodie types, when we heard about Parrillan, the outdoor, \u201ccook your own dinner\u201d restaurant opening in Coal Drops Yard, in London\u2019s King\u2019s Cross. Well, we\u2019re not laughing now, are we? OK, we are a bit. But that isn\u2019t to say that Parrillan, by the Hart brothers, creators of Barrafina and El Pastor, is a terrible idea. For what is nicer than barbecuing exemplary produce on a charcoal grill in the great outdoors? No. It\u2019s merely a peculiar idea. Parrillan relies on proper summers, balmy nights and a lack of sideways sleet. Powerful heaters are perched beside every table, to err on the safe side. It is apparently modelled on the Ibizan restaurant Ca\u2019n Pilot, and serves impeccable meats and shellfish \u2013 50-day-aged rump steak, diver-caught scallops, milk-fed lamb\u2019s kidney \u2013 all raw, and all at premium prices, then asks you to grill them yourself on your own personal mini grill in the centre of each table. They come with four house sauces: mojo verdo, mojo rojo, salsa ibizenca and, my favourite, a rich, red, almond-based romesco. The whole process is a little fondue-ish, a little Korean barbecue-esque. I\u2019m not sure I wholly approve, but here we are. The hospitality landscape weaves ever more away from the essence of actually being hospitable: app-based ordering, collecting your own food while brandishing a buzzer, queueing for your own drinks, clearing your own plates. Parrillan smashes this out of the park with \u201cBe your own chef\u201d. Literally. Take the middlewhite pork collar (at \u00a311 for just a few slices), arrange it on the grill with pretty tongs, sear it yourself, judge when it\u2019s cooked, then plate up. By 2025, I\u2019ll be showing up at restaurants with a stash of Finish Quantum tablets in my bag and loading the dishwasher. \u201cDarling, let\u2019s not take the Magimix out on the town with us again,\u201d Charles will sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s heavy.\u201d \u201cBut, sweetheart,\u201d I\u2019ll huff, \u201cI want a pudding. How about I just bring the dough hook?\u201d Still, on the Sunday lunchtime we visit, the place is heaving. As the aroma of top-grade red carabiniero prawns and Iberican pork sweetbreads sizzling on numerous open grills drifts across Coal Drops Yard, the effect is marked. Faces pop up at the side of the cordoned-off area of the outside restaurant terrace like curious meerkats, wowing as plates of Cantabrian anchovies \u2013 those very good ones, like unforgettable, caramel-coloured wonders \u2013 and pan con tomate (thankfully already prepared) are shipped to our table, alongside plates of presa Iberica de Bellota and escalivada (roast aubergines, tomatoes and peppers drenched in excellent olive oil). We eat, ploughing through money like Aristotle Onassis and Maria Callas anchored off the shore of Antibes: \u00a312 for those anchovies, \u00a314 for shu-toro marinaded tuna, a single scallop at nine quid. We drink a jug of sangria blanca (albari\u00f1o, brandy, apple juice, grapefruit juice, lemon) while trays of enormo Spanish Xoriguer gin and tonics seem in constant transportation to the other diners. Within 10 minutes, I grow weary of the responsibility of grilling my own lunch, but the men at my table are delighted by the task. Personally, I find the grill a positive boon for obscuring dishes one hopes not to share, such as the patatas panadera (one large spud, chopped, roasted with oil, in a bowl. Very delicious. Five pounds, thank you). Still, there\u2019s no doubt that whatever is occurring \u201cinside\u201d Parrillan seems alluring to everyone outside. Parrillan is a wholly convivial experience. It is sexy and European in a way we\u2019ve decided we\u2019ll have no more of over here soon. Perhaps Parrillan will keep the grills after October, when those Cantabrian anchovies may dry up and we can make Heinz baked bean toasties on them instead. The puddings are very slim on the ground, but the tarta de la casa the day we are there is a mel i mato tart, which is a sort of bottomless cheesecake made with artisanal cheese from Girona strewn with honey and nuts. As we leave, the chef appears and shakes our hands, though I\u2019m still trying to work out whether it was to thank us for coming or to thank us for doing his shift for him. I could have flown to Ibiza for less than we spent at Parrillan. The future feels increasingly silly. I\u2019m merely the conduit. Don\u2019t get all up in my grill. \u2022 Parrillan, Stable Street, Coal Drops Yard, London N1, 020-7018 3339. Open all week, noon-10pm. From about \u00a340 a head, plus drinks and service.

      "bodyText": "The young face of Moscow\u2019s protests, a 21-year-old libertarian with 123,000 followers on YouTube, appeared in court on a television screen this week. Yegor Zhukov, a political science student at Russia\u2019s prestigious Higher School of Economics, faces eight years in prison over controversial \u201cmass unrest\u201d charges. The Kremlin\u2019s critics think the charges are a scare tactic to crush Russia\u2019s largest protests in years, set to continue for their fourth weekend on Saturday. From a jail cell, Zhukov unleashed a broadside at the political system pieced together by Vladimir Putin, who was confirmed as prime minister for the first time 20 years ago on Friday. \u201cI want to thank our government for the enormous amount of work it does every day to discredit itself,\u201d said Zhukov by video link on Thursday. \u201cTruly, it\u2019s hard to find anyone who has done more to increase the numbers of the opposition than the Russian government.\u201d Like many protesters, Zhukov was a child in 1999 when a 46-year-old Putin was named the country\u2019s next prime minister, launching a generation of rule under the former intelligence officer. For many, Putin has become synonymous with the state, less politician than historical figure, and an arbiter of conflicts. Just in the past year, despite his attempts to install reliable allies across the country, protests have broken out over multiple rubbish dumps, a church in Yekaterinburg, internal borders in the North Caucasus, and now city council elections in the capital. Putin has not been the main focus of ire of these latest protests, which were prompted by the disqualification of independent candidates such as Zhukov from a low-level election. But the officials he installed have. They include the Moscow mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, who served as Putin\u2019s chief of staff, and Russian elections commissioner, Ella Pamfilova, who Putin appointed in 2016 to return trust to Russia\u2019s voting system. In fact, as Lyubov Sobol, another protest leader, pointed out this week, the leading curator of Russian politics, Putin\u2019s first deputy chief of staff Sergei Kiriyenko, and Moscow\u2019s elections commission head, have also been in government for decades, holdovers from the difficult 1990s. \u201cIt\u2019s all his system, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Mikhail Kostomarov, a 24-year-old protester, said of Putin last week. Since the last large round of protests in 2011-12, Muscovites have largely been won over by a campaign of urban improvements in exchange for political choice, an update on Putin\u2019s own bargain that offered Russians economic stability above all. But that system seems to have calcified, failing to mollify a core group of protesters or keep up with the hopes of a younger generation of Russians. \u201cThe pace of life has caught up with the pace of this president,\u201d said Konstantin Gaaze, a political analyst. \u201cThe gap between what happens in politics and real life is growing. There is a kind of fatigue.\u201d Cautionary tales about life before Putin carry less weight with young people. In a piece for the website Meduza this week, the sociologist Olga Zeveleva called warnings about the lawless 1990s \u201cone of the Putin administration\u2019s foundational myths\u201d, and one that fails to resonate with protesters born in the 2000s. The Kremlin \u2013 and Putin \u2013 also appear out of touch on a cultural level. While Moscow protested last week, Putin was riding motorcycles with an ageing biker gang, the Night Wolves, whom he has tried to sell as positive role models for young people. The Kremlin\u2019s stable of entertainers lacks young stars, particularly those on social media sites such as YouTube. \u201cPeople like [blogger Yury] Dud can speak to young people,\u201d said Gaaze, referring to a popular sports journalist and interviewer who attended last week\u2019s protest. \u201cWho does the Kremlin have now besides [rapper] Timati?\u201d Oxxxymiron, another popular hip-hop artist, joined the protests last week, and on Thursday offered to post bail at Zhukov\u2019s hearing. The Kremlin has responded by saying it has paid little attention to the protests. \u201cWe do not agree with those who call what is happening a political crisis,\u201d Putin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitri Peskov, said. That may be true. According to insiders, Putin is not receiving daily updates on the protests as he did in 2011-12 when demonstrations attracted more than 100,000 people. But it also risks Putin seeming indifferent to what is happening in the country. \u201cHis only plan is to hold on to power and to deal with geopolitics,\u201d said Sobol, the protest leader who was also a candidate for the city council. \u201cIt seems like what\u2019s happening inside of Russia doesn\u2019t bother him and he doesn\u2019t think about Russia\u2019s economic growth.\u201d The protests are an irritant, but have little chance of toppling the Kremlin. Still, they are widely viewed as mismanaged by the authorities, which have turned an obscure election into an opposition cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. And they come as Putin\u2019s ratings have reached historic lows, largely due to stagnant wages and a decision last year to raise the pension age. \u201cYou can\u2019t say his ratings have collapsed,\u201d said Gaaze. \u201cIt\u2019s more correct to speak about an erosion of his rating. But it will continue.\u201d",

Other flags include a focus on the technical side of medicine while ignoring patients\u2019 experiences, professional battles taking precedence over patient needs and lax implementation of protocols such as surgical checklists. Stress and burnout are also often endemic in teams with a poor working culture. Five toxic subcultures emerged: divas, factional, patronage, embattled and insular. Divas are powerful, successful professionals who think the normal rules of behaviour only apply to others. They are typically ill-tempered bullies who disrespect managers and colleagues, and ignore protocols. Teams dominated by patronage have high-status, well-connected specialists who exert huge power over their colleagues. They will often be doing exceptional work, but the downside is that the leaders are difficult to challenge and manage, and will happily compromise other parts of the organisation in their lust for glory. In factional groups \u2013 let\u2019s not call them teams \u2013 disagreement becomes endemic and people start to organise themselves around perpetuating conflict. Faction leaders try to drag everyone else in. Patients suffer. Just how bad this can get has been exposed by the culture of tribalism and mistrust that was allowed to fester for years in the cardiac unit at London\u2019s St George\u2019s hospital. Complex heart surgery was suspended amid concerns that the conflicts were causing avoidable deaths. Embattled teams feel overwhelmed by all the unmet need they see in their patients. Staff are stressed, anxious and burned out. Believing their cause is hopeless they reject offers of help because they don\u2019t see how anything could make a difference. Some GP practices \u2013 flooded with patients and short-staffed \u2013 slip into this siege mentality. Insular teams have become isolated from the professional mainstream, and have often lost sight of what a good service looks like. Old-style, single-handed GP practices easily fall prey to this trap. Insularity is a particular problem for secure mental health units; isolated behind barriers, they focus on incarceration rather than care and treatment. Hospital managers know that turning around a rotten clinical culture often takes years and can feel quite brutal. Confronting inappropriate behaviour by powerful staff eats time and saps energy. Sometimes the cause of the problem simply needs to be forced out of the organisation. But managers need to check their own behaviour before judging that of others. Rotten cultures take root when senior leaders lack the skill or courage to act quickly and decisively when they see the warning signs. Bullying by managers is guaranteed to bring out the worst in people. Many senior doctors have justifiable complaints about their treatment at the hands of local executives or staff from NHS Improvement and NHS England. Demonstrating behaviour they want to see in others, putting effort into building relationships and supporting colleagues, understanding problems from the perspective of frontline staff, showing up when things are tough and responding positively to difficult news are just some of the simple leadership actions that make a profound difference. Medical leadership itself requires massive investment. Too many doctors thrust into the top roles still find they are largely left to make it up as they go along because training and support is inadequate. Divas and bullies are the symptoms of a rotten culture, but not always the cause. \u2022 Richard Vize is a public policy commentator and analyst",

The first American indoor climbing gym, Vertical World in Seattle, opened in 1987. Now<a href=\"http://www.climbingbusinessjournal.com/directory/map/\"> there are over 500 nationwide</a>, from the flattest states to the craggiest, underlining the health and fitness industry\u2019s embrace of climbing \u2013 especially the mental and physical challenge of bouldering. At the same time, the best outdoor climbers have seen their profiles raised in ways that would have been impossible without social media, given that, for obvious reasons, theirs is hardly an accessible spectator sport.</p> <p>\u201cClimbing has exploded really over the last 10 or 15 years,\u201d says DiGiulian, who took it up in 1998, the year she turned six, at a gym near her home in the Washington DC area. \u201cI never really aspired to be a professional climber because I didn\u2019t know that it existed. And it didn\u2019t, really. You lived in your van in Yosemite and ate granola bars. It was pretty minimalist \u2013 and no shade on that at all.\u201d</p> <p>By the time she was 11 she was winning titles but it still felt like an obscure hobby. \u201cThere was this total disconnect from me and my friends at school over climbing,\u201d she says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t really going to show my pictures to my friends. I found that climbing was this other thing that I did, I chose to save my breath from explaining it and didn\u2019t talk about it too much. But social media\u2019s become this window to share not only with your friends and family but people who we don\u2019t even know. We can bring them along on the adventure.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BzsseXGn79g/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

to an island off the West Coast of Central Africa. Any guesses where we are headed? - Africa may be my favorite continent I have traveled to so far. Granted I\u2019ve only been to 6 of the 7... Antarctica still awaits(!); however, I love the wild beauty of every country here that I have had the privilege to experience. - \ud83d\udcf8: @ladzinski of me climbing a First Ascent; bolted by Andrew Pedley, in Waterfall Boven, SA</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sashadigiulian/\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> S A S H A \u2022 D I G I U L I A N</a> (@sashadigiulian) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2019-07-09T13:52:33+00:00\">Jul 9, 2019 at 6:52am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> </figure>  <p>Now 26 and based in Boulder, Colorado, DiGiulian is one of professional climbing\u2019s biggest names \u2013 thanks to her achievements, with more than 30 first female ascents.</p> <p>She works with videographers and photographers, has started her own production company, Female Focused Adventures, and has more than 420,000 followers on Instagram as well as being active on Facebook and Twitter. Her feeds feature jaw-dropping selfies from precarious ascents in exotic locations, and her posts and videos offer insights into her life and work. She\u2019s also <a href=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/2309306/what-we-can-learn-climbings-bullying-saga\">taken a stand against sexism and cyberbullying</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe way that you used to get sponsored was you did something, like you did well in a competition, or you climbed something noteworthy outside and a climbing magazine would write about you and after that article was written you had this kind of presence that sponsors in the industry would pick up and read and they would approach you, or you would approach them,\u201d she says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/22/i-took-a-deep-breath-the-10-year-old-girl-who-conquered-yosemites-el-capitan\">'I took a deep breath': the 10-year-old girl who conquered Yosemite's El Capitan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cNow it\u2019s totally different. With social media, companies find out more about you through your social media page than having to flip through climbing magazines. The biggest shift is that you\u2019re no longer reliant on other forms of media to be sharing your news. Social media has become this platform that you have your own voice and you can share what you\u2019re doing and also create a voice for what you stand for. Which is pretty cool.\u201d</p> <p>While Shauna Coxsey, Britain\u2019s leading climber, hopes to star at the 2020 Olympics, DiGiulian is not interested in competing in Tokyo, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/apr/11/shauna-coxsey-britain-no1-climber-olympics-tokyo-2020\">sport climbing will be held in an urban park</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s something about your sport being on the Olympic stage that provides a legitimacy that we all, as climbers, know exists - but maybe it\u2019s kind of cool, gets more kids involved too,\u201d says DiGiulian. \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t for me, the format.\u201d Unusually, climbers will be asked to excel in three disciplines: speed (a head-to-head race lasting five to eight seconds), bouldering (scaling fixed routes on a 4m-high wall in four minutes) and lead (climbing as high as possible on a 15m-plus wall within six minutes).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B0Q3SFJHlRR/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

      "bodyText": "As plumes of spray from the roiling Yosemite Falls cascaded to their left, Sasha DiGiulian, Jon Cardwell and Marcus Garcia completed the first continuous free ascent of Yosemite National Park\u2019s 1,700-foot Misty Wall. The feat in 2017 took fourteen-and-a-half hours. The next day, DiGuilian posted dramatic images on her Instagram feed that were liked by thousands of people and used by climbing websites that helped news of the achievement spread rapidly across the globe. As in other extreme sports, many of the world\u2019s best climbers are slick, brand-aware social media users \u2013 a far cry from the pre-digital days when they were closer in status to cult heroes than celebrities. Self-described \u201cdirtbags\u201d lived in tents and cars in Yosemite in the shadow of El Capitan, the sheer granite monolith that stands higher than the world\u2019s tallest skyscraper, the Burj Khalifa. Now about 150,000 climbers throng the Californian park each year and Free Solo, the movie about Alex Honnold\u2019s attempt to ascend El Capitan without ropes, won the Oscar for best documentary feature in February. A once determinedly insular and counter-cultural pursuit will make its Olympic debut in Tokyo next year, accelerating its move towards the mainstream. It helps that mountains are optional. The first American indoor climbing gym, Vertical World in Seattle, opened in 1987. Now there are over 500 nationwide, from the flattest states to the craggiest, underlining the health and fitness industry\u2019s embrace of climbing \u2013 especially the mental and physical challenge of bouldering. At the same time, the best outdoor climbers have seen their profiles raised in ways that would have been impossible without social media, given that, for obvious reasons, theirs is hardly an accessible spectator sport. \u201cClimbing has exploded really over the last 10 or 15 years,\u201d says DiGiulian, who took it up in 1998, the year she turned six, at a gym near her home in the Washington DC area. \u201cI never really aspired to be a professional climber because I didn\u2019t know that it existed. And it didn\u2019t, really. You lived in your van in Yosemite and ate granola bars. It was pretty minimalist \u2013 and no shade on that at all.\u201d By the time she was 11 she was winning titles but it still felt like an obscure hobby. \u201cThere was this total disconnect from me and my friends at school over climbing,\u201d she says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t really going to show my pictures to my friends. I found that climbing was this other thing that I did, I chose to save my breath from explaining it and didn\u2019t talk about it too much. But social media\u2019s become this window to share not only with your friends and family but people who we don\u2019t even know. We can bring them along on the adventure.\u201d Now 26 and based in Boulder, Colorado, DiGiulian is one of professional climbing\u2019s biggest names \u2013 thanks to her achievements, with more than 30 first female ascents. She works with videographers and photographers, has started her own production company, Female Focused Adventures, and has more than 420,000 followers on Instagram as well as being active on Facebook and Twitter. Her feeds feature jaw-dropping selfies from precarious ascents in exotic locations, and her posts and videos offer insights into her life and work. She\u2019s also taken a stand against sexism and cyberbullying. \u201cThe way that you used to get sponsored was you did something, like you did well in a competition, or you climbed something noteworthy outside and a climbing magazine would write about you and after that article was written you had this kind of presence that sponsors in the industry would pick up and read and they would approach you, or you would approach them,\u201d she says. \u201cNow it\u2019s totally different. With social media, companies find out more about you through your social media page than having to flip through climbing magazines. The biggest shift is that you\u2019re no longer reliant on other forms of media to be sharing your news. Social media has become this platform that you have your own voice and you can share what you\u2019re doing and also create a voice for what you stand for. Which is pretty cool.\u201d While Shauna Coxsey, Britain\u2019s leading climber, hopes to star at the 2020 Olympics, DiGiulian is not interested in competing in Tokyo, where sport climbing will be held in an urban park. \u201cThere\u2019s something about your sport being on the Olympic stage that provides a legitimacy that we all, as climbers, know exists - but maybe it\u2019s kind of cool, gets more kids involved too,\u201d says DiGiulian. \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t for me, the format.\u201d Unusually, climbers will be asked to excel in three disciplines: speed (a head-to-head race lasting five to eight seconds), bouldering (scaling fixed routes on a 4m-high wall in four minutes) and lead (climbing as high as possible on a 15m-plus wall within six minutes). DiGiulian, Savannah Cummins and Angela Vanwiemeersch have just completed an all-female ascent of Pico C\u00e3o Grande, a 450m-high needle-like protrusion amid the lush greenery of Sao Tom\u00e9 &amp; Principe, a tiny island nation off the west coast of central Africa. \u201cWhen they look at a woman\u2019s success and she\u2019s with a male climbing partner there\u2019s this assumption that the male took the lead, the woman was not doing as much work. Often it\u2019s not the case. Angela and I are like, let\u2019s just do it, this tower, and just be me and you, no one can reattribute our success to some male partner,\u201d Di Giulian said before the expedition set off.

So it\u2019s a great location for this blockbuster that marks the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11. When Armstrong made that step, he was standing on the shoulders of so many dreamers with telescopes. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.rmg.co.uk/whats-on/moon-exhibition\">National Maritime Museum, SE10 to 5 January</a></em></p> <h2>Lee Krasner</h2> <p>In the 1940s, American art burst out of provincialism as Manhattan became the home of the new. The abstract expressionists painted with a freedom and scale that suited New York. Lee Krasner splashed paint about with the best of them but subordinated her success to that of her husband Jackson Pollock. Here she gets her due. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.barbican.org.uk/whats-on/2019/event/lee-krasner-living-colour\">Barbican Art Gallery, EC2, to 1 September</a></em></p> <h2>D\u00f3ra Maurer</h2> <p>This Hungarian conceptual artist was part of a dissident art scene under communist one-party rule in the 1970s and 80s. She used found materials, photography and film to create quirkily individualist pieces that rejected the conformism of official art and life. But this career survey is not just a history lesson. Today, Maurer makes dazzling paintings whose abstract exploration of order and disorder is taking her life\u2019s work to another level. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/dora-maurer\">Tate Modern, SE1, to 5 July</a></em></p> <h2>Wild and Majestic</h2> <p>The image of Scotland was reinvented in the Romantic age, when the novels of Walter Scott popularised its history and painters including JMW Turner trekked to such spectacular locations as Fingal\u2019s Cave in search of natural grandeur. This exhibition looks at the rise of Highland tourism, the cult of tartan and other aspects of an age that still shapes how Scotland is imagined. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.nms.ac.uk/exhibitions-events/exhibitions/national-museum-of-scotland/wild-and-majestic/\">National Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh, to 10 November</a></em></p> <h2>Bridget Riley</h2> <p>This is a scintillating retrospective of Britain\u2019s most uplifting modern artist. Riley\u2019s intelligence and passion leaves you in ecstasies. Her black-and-white optical paintings of the 1960s create a magical mystery tour through unreal spaces that warp and wave before your eyes \u2013 or rather in the mind.

She has said this is the last time she\u2019ll play the role, largely because she\u2019s a fair bit older than her memorable twentysomething creation.

Appropriate is a fierce and haunting drama set in an old plantation home in Mississippi, where a family gather after their dad\u2019s death and unearth some chilling home truths.

Highlights include Charley Miles\u2019s Daughterhood, about two sisters who reunite after 10 years chasing very different dreams. Islander is a Scottish folk-infused musical from Stewart Melton and Finn Anderson, and Tim Cowbury\u2019s new play, The Claim, is a probing response to the stories of those seeking refuge in the UK. <br><em><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/venues/roundabout-summerhall-1\">Summerhall, Edinburgh, to 25 August</a></em></p> <p><em>MG</em></p> <h2><strong>Three of the best ... dance shows</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8e714ffff50fead4eb079ec94e4b6bd062483df5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e714ffff50fead4eb079ec94e4b6bd062483df5/253_143_2669_1489/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hard to Be Soft: A Belfast Prayer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"558\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hard to Be Soft: A Belfast Prayer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luca Truffarelli</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Hard to Be Soft: A Belfast Prayer</h2> <p>DJ and film composer David Holmes provides the soundtrack for this dance piece from a really intriguing and original young artist, Oona Doherty, who also stars in it.

Royal Albert Hall, SW7, Tuesday 20 August The Hunger Based upon a first-person account of the 1840s Irish famine, Donnacha Dennehy\u2019s music-theatre piece, a \u201cdocu-cantata\u201d, receives its first staged performances in Tom Creed\u2019s production. The score incorporates traditional Irish songs alongside his own music, with soprano Katherine Manley and sean-n\u00f3s singer Iarla \u00d3 Lion\u00e1ird as the soloists, plus Dennehy\u2019s own Crash Ensemble. Abbey Theatre: Abbey Stage, Dublin, Monday 19 to 24 August AC Five of the best ... exhibitions The Moon It was at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich that early astronomers such as Halley studied the moon. So it\u2019s a great location for this blockbuster that marks the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11. When Armstrong made that step, he was standing on the shoulders of so many dreamers with telescopes. National Maritime Museum, SE10 to 5 January Lee Krasner In the 1940s, American art burst out of provincialism as Manhattan became the home of the new. The abstract expressionists painted with a freedom and scale that suited New York. Lee Krasner splashed paint about with the best of them but subordinated her success to that of her husband Jackson Pollock. Here she gets her due. Barbican Art Gallery, EC2, to 1 September D\u00f3ra Maurer This Hungarian conceptual artist was part of a dissident art scene under communist one-party rule in the 1970s and 80s. She used found materials, photography and film to create quirkily individualist pieces that rejected the conformism of official art and life. But this career survey is not just a history lesson. Today, Maurer makes dazzling paintings whose abstract exploration of order and disorder is taking her life\u2019s work to another level. Tate Modern, SE1, to 5 July Wild and Majestic The image of Scotland was reinvented in the Romantic age, when the novels of Walter Scott popularised its history and painters including JMW Turner trekked to such spectacular locations as Fingal\u2019s Cave in search of natural grandeur. This exhibition looks at the rise of Highland tourism, the cult of tartan and other aspects of an age that still shapes how Scotland is imagined. National Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh, to 10 November Bridget Riley This is a scintillating retrospective of Britain\u2019s most uplifting modern artist. Riley\u2019s intelligence and passion leaves you in ecstasies. Her black-and-white optical paintings of the 1960s create a magical mystery tour through unreal spaces that warp and wave before your eyes \u2013 or rather in the mind. Her colour paintings take you still further into realms of bliss. Unmissable. Scottish National Gallery, Edinburgh, to 22 September JJ Five of the best ... theatre shows Roots Theatre company 1927 doesn\u2019t do many shows but when it does they dazzle (see The Animals and Children Took to the Streets and Golem). Roots is its fourth stage show and is based on thousands of little-known and undoubtedly quirky folk tales. Expect beautifully crafted animation that somehow manages to feel both slick and old school. There is also a live musical score involving, um, donkeys\u2019 jaws, musical saws and Peruvian prayer boxes. Church Hill Theatre, Edinburgh, to 25 August Fleabag After two TV series and a New York run, Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s smash-hit play returns to the West End for a final victory lap. She has said this is the last time she\u2019ll play the role, largely because she\u2019s a fair bit older than her memorable twentysomething creation. So this is your final chance to catch Waller-Bridge in the sexually charged, sharp-tongued role that set her career soaring. Wyndham\u2019s Theatre, WC2, Tuesday 20 August to 14 September Torch Song Another month, another new theatre in London. The Turbine Theatre is part of the Battersea Power Station redevelopment and will open with a revival of Harvey Fierstein\u2019s Tony award-winning musical. Star choreographer Drew McOnie directs and Matthew Needham (Summer and Smoke) will star as Arnold, a Jewish drag queen in 70s/80s New York. The Turbine Theatre, SW11, Thursday 22 August to 13 October Appropriate US playwright Branden Jacobs-Jenkins is finally becoming a household name over here and it is about time: he is such an exciting talent. Appropriate is a fierce and haunting drama set in an old plantation home in Mississippi, where a family gather after their dad\u2019s death and unearth some chilling home truths. The director is Ola Ince, responsible for the Royal Court\u2019s Poet in da Corner. Donmar Warehouse, WC2, to 5 October Roundabout @ Summerhall Paines Plough\u2019s Roundabout plays are always packed with class and creativity, each as distinctive as the next. Highlights include Charley Miles\u2019s Daughterhood, about two sisters who reunite after 10 years chasing very different dreams. Islander is a Scottish folk-infused musical from Stewart Melton and Finn Anderson, and Tim Cowbury\u2019s new play, The Claim, is a probing response to the stories of those seeking refuge in the UK. Summerhall, Edinburgh, to 25 August MG Three of the best ... dance shows Hard to Be Soft: A Belfast Prayer DJ and film composer David Holmes provides the soundtrack for this dance piece from a really intriguing and original young artist, Oona Doherty, who also stars in it. The show finds inspiration in Doherty\u2019s (and Holmes\u2019s) home city of Belfast, lifting the lid on the macho veneers of its hardened men and the women who are just as tough. Royal Lyceum Theatre, Edinburgh, Wednesday 21 to 24 August Dane Hurst: Falling Man The superlative former Rambert dancer Hurst is carving out a new career as a choreographer. His latest work, Falling Man, looks at male mental health and suicide and is created in collaboration with composer and visual artist Tom Rowland. Wilton\u2019s Music Hall, E1, Monday 19 &amp; Tuesday 20 August Born to Manifest &amp; Like Honey The fringe is the place to discover new talent, so try this double bill from Joseph Toonga and Becky Namgauds, respectively. They both fuse hip-hop and contemporary dance to address issues from black male identity to menstruation. Dance Base, Edinburgh, Thursday 22 to 25 August LW Main composite image: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian; \u00a9 Bridget Riley; Kevin Mazur; Kobal/Rex/Shutterstock",

The songs are horrifically soppy. Kelly Clarkson voices relentlessly cheerful Moxxy, a fuzzy pink doll with a missing front tooth who lives in the town of Uglyville. Moxxy wakes up every morning believing that today is the day she\u2019ll finally be picked to live with a child. The dark truth is that all the cuddlies in Uglyville have been spat out of a chute at the toy factory and on to the scrap heap. One day Moxxy travels up the chute and the story shifts to the Institute of Perfection, the final testing stage for dolls, where the mayor is evil doll kid Lou (Nick Jonas), a plasticky cross between Justin Bieber and Draco Malfoy. Veteran Kelly Asbury (Gnomeo &amp; Juliet, Shrek 2) directs with brisk professionalism but the script is fussily and unimaginatively plotted. I had a problem too with the film\u2019s message. The point ostensibly being made is that it\u2019s your imperfections that make you special \u2013 let your freak flag fly! Ugly is cool! But the film is constantly defining what ugly is: freckles, crooked teeth, excess weight, glasses, clumsiness. At times it feels like an unintentional crib sheet for under-sevens bullying. UglyDolls is released in the UK on 16 August.",

Several members of Netanyahu\u2019s current cabinet are under criminal investigations as well, and it is perhaps not a coincidence that the decision to bar Omar and Tlaib came on the same day as the announcement of <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/prosecutor-said-to-recommend-graft-charges-against-interior-minister-deri/\">possible graft charges</a> against the interior minister, Aryeh Deri, who signed off on the denial of entry decision.

And, sadly, Tlaib\u2019s situation here is not exceptional either. Israel routinely denies Palestinians living in the diaspora the chance even to visit their families and ancestral homes while Jews from anywhere in the world can become Israeli citizens with full rights.

But the tactically savvy pro-Israel groups, those that fret about keeping support for Israel a bipartisan issue, no longer possess the same power they once did. Today, the Trump administration\u2019s Mideast policy is determined by an alliance of the religious, pro-settler Jewish right and Christian evangelicals.</p> <p>Such an alliance has little need for bipartisanship, which for the Jewish right entails compromises \u2013 like lip service to two-state solution \u2013 that they are unwilling to make.

The truth is that, though you might only handle your salad bowl for five minutes, traces of it will stick around in the environment for ever.</p> <p>That was the central finding of <a href=\"https://newfoodeconomy.org/pfas-forever-chemicals-sweetgreen-chipotle-compostable-biodegradable-bowls/\">an investigative feature</a> I published last week in the New Food Economy, a non-profit newsroom covering the forces shaping American food, where I\u2019m deputy editor. I spent months interviewing more than a dozen scientists, food service industry experts, packaging professionals and waste management leaders. Everyone I spoke to said the same thing: the familiar bowls all contain PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, a broad class of \u201cforever chemicals\u201d that persist indefinitely and have been linked to troubling health effects.</p> <p>We didn\u2019t just take them at their word. The New Food Economy did its own testing of bowls from eight different Manhattan restaurants, including multiple locations of Chipotle, Dig and Sweetgreen \u2013 restaurants that run ambitious composting programs and claim their bowls have significant environmental benefits. The results were striking. All 18 bowls tested contained high levels of fluorine, according to Graham Peaslee, the University of Notre Dame chemist who conducted our test. Peaslee and other scientists I spoke to say this leaves no doubt that these bowls were manufactured using PFAS, confirming what industry leaders had told me: that all takeout containers made from molded plant fibers contain these chemicals. This widespread use of PFAS in \u201ccompostable\u201d bowls had been a closely guarded industry secret, and had not been reported previously. You can read my investigation <a href=\"https://newfoodeconomy.org/pfas-forever-chemicals-sweetgreen-chipotle-compostable-biodegradable-bowls/\">here</a>.</p> <p>PFAS do a great job protecting bowls from heat, moisture and grease. Without them, the plant-based material would be much more delicate, falling to pieces quickly during contact with a salad or hot meal. But that usefulness is a faustian bargain. Speaking broadly, PFAS are manmade compounds characterized by powerful carbon-fluorine bonds, a kind of molecular armor that makes it impossible for enzymes and microbes to attack. This makes them great at repelling grease, but it\u2019s also why they don\u2019t break down \u2013 and why they\u2019re so concerning for public health.</p> <p>Thankfully, the most concerning varieties of PFAS \u2013 PFOS and PFOA, which have been <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6104644/#SD1\">linked to a broad range of serious health effects</a> \u2013 have been banned or phased out by industry. But the newer varieties approved for use in food packaging by the FDA have risks of their own, concerns <a href=\"https://enveurope.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s12302-018-0134-4\">summarized</a> by German government scientists in the peer-reviewed journal Environmental Sciences Europe.

The police banned the street demonstration planned by the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) on Thursday night, after saying it would turn violent, and warned that anyone who took part would be committing a crime. Police trucks filled the streets of Harare on Thursday, using loudhailers to warn residents \u201cyou will rot in jail\u201d if they participated in the demonstrations, while teams searched vehicles at checkpoints on roads leading into the city. Authorities appear to have been rattled by the planned protests, which were organised by the MDC to protest against the deteriorating economy. The opposition was determined to continue with the demonstrations, said the MDC spokesman Daniel Molokele, adding that a high court judge would preside over the party\u2019s application from 7am (0500 GMT). In recent months millions have been hit by soaring prices of food and fuel, while foreign exchange shortages have led to a lack of vital medicines and other goods. Police said they have evidence that the demonstrations would be violent. \u201cSecurity services will not fold hands and allow violence, destruction of property, intimidation, threats and clandestine night acts of violent agitation to take centre stage,\u201d said a spokesman, who claimed police had recovered a stash of slingshots and catapults to be used in the protests. The MDC said its protest would be peaceful. Party officials told the Guardian that the stones had been planted in a bid to smear the opposition. The first rally is due to be held in Harare, and then in five regional centres. Via his spokesman the MDC leader, Nelson Chamisa, underlined late on Thursday that the opposition was calling for more than just concessions on austerity. \u201cAugust 16 is a special day in this peaceful struggle,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cOnly a legitimate people\u2019s government can deal with the people\u2019s grievances. [We] will engage in a persistent peaceful struggle until Zimbabwe is the land of the happy and free. Real change is the only answer to Zimbabwe\u2019s questions.\u201d The protests come more than 18 months since Emmerson Mnangagwa took power after a military takeover ousted the veteran ruler Robert Mugabe in November 2017. Mnangagwa then went on to win a closely fought and contested election promising investment, transparency and \u201cgood days ahead\u201d for the former British colony. There are widespread fears that any unrest will prompt a brutal crackdown. In August last year six people were killed by troops deployed to clear the centre of Harare after an opposition rally against alleged vote rigging. In January, 13 died and hundreds were raped or beaten as security forces quelled unrest following a hike in fuel prices.

Amnesty international criticised \u201can escalating crackdown against human rights defenders, activists, civil society leaders and members of the opposition, including abductions and torture.\u201d Cain Mathema, minister for home affairs, warned earlier this week that police were ready to deal with \u201cunruly elements who want to cause alarm and despondency in the country\u201d. Mnangagwa\u2019s ruling Zanu-PF party, which holds a majority in parliament, is pushing through the maintenance of peace and order bill \u2013 which the opposition and human rights activists describe as very harsh. Parliament met through the night to pass the controversial legislation. On Thursday, the president urged the opposition to engage in dialogue. \u201cOur strongest asset is our unity. I reiterate my calls to all opposition leaders that my door remains open [and] my arms remain outstretched. Riots [and] destructive violence must be rejected; peaceful constructive dialogue are the way forward,\u201d he said in a statement. Nick Mangwana, the permanent secretary at the information ministry, issued a statement blaming an unidentified \u201cthird force\u201d for the attacks. The Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum, a coalition of rights groups, said it believed state security agents were responsible for the latest abductions and beatings, which have forced some activists to go into hiding. Obert Masaraure, the leader of a union representing 30,000 teachers in impoverished rural areas, said he had been forced to flee his home after \u201cstate agents\u201d visited. \u201cNo one is safe at the moment. The regime is baying for blood,\u201d said Masaraure, who has been arrested five times since December and has been charged with subversion. Zimbabwe is crippled by massive debts incurred during Mugabe\u2019s rule and needs a multibillion-dollar bailout to prevent economic collapse. However, continuing repression and a lack of tangible political reform mean there is little chance of international institutions offering major aid packages.",

Australia more so than almost any other country has the opportunity to prosper economically through decarbonisation. We can, as they say, have our cake and eat it too.</p> <p>The pathway to global decarbonisation relies heavily on the shift from coal, oil and gas to renewable resources. In a decarbonised world not only do we power our homes and businesses with renewables, but we also power our cars, buses, trains and industry with wind, solar and storage. With technologies like electric vehicles, hydrogen buses and electromagnetic industrial heating, this is all eminently possible.</p> <p>As a country with some of the best solar and wind resources in the world, vast areas of land, a low population and manufacturing base and strong trading relationships particularly in Asia, Australia is uniquely positioned to help decarbonise our region. Indeed, it is not only our Pacific neighbours who are asking for our help. Our biggest trading partners \u2013 Japan, South Korea and Taiwan \u2013 are looking eagerly at Australia\u2019s renewable resources to help them act on climate.</p> <p>Already, there are plans in development to export solar energy to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/14/just-a-matter-of-when-the-20bn-plan-to-power-singapore-with-australian-solar\">Singapore through a Sun </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/14/just-a-matter-of-when-the-20bn-plan-to-power-singapore-with-australian-solar\">Cable from the Northern Territory</a>. Macquarie Capital is financing the development of the Asia Renewable Energy Hub in Western Australia. This project, which has <a href=\"https://thewest.com.au/news/pilbara-news/planned-pilbara-renewable-energy-hub-scaled-up-ng-b881258775z\">recently grown to 15GW of solar and wind</a>, will not only power the mining operations of the Pilbara and increased onshore minerals refining, it will also generate renewable hydrogen that can be exported to our neighbours.</p> <p>This week, Pacific leaders asked Australia to stop <em>expanding</em> our coal industry. As a country that has been exporting coal since 1799, this request came as an affront to our federal government. However, given that coal is the biggest cause of climate change and Australia\u2019s largest contribution, we cannot be serious about stopping climate change without planning to move beyond coal.</p> <p>While moving away from coal will have its challenges, it is possible. It is also better to restructure our economy deliberately, supporting those who work in the coal industry, than for these communities to be left to the whims of global market forces.</p> <p>Already the Latrobe Valley Authority is showing how we might do this. From electric vehicle manufacturing, to investment in transport infrastructure, to more jobs in healthcare, their efforts to diversify the economy of the Latrobe Valley in Victoria are showing progress.</p> <p>Restructuring our economy does not happen over night, but we need to recognise that it has already started. In the past three years $9bn have been invested in building renewable energy generation. According to Macromonitor, the renewables boom is <a href=\"https://thenewdaily.com.au/money/finance-news/2019/08/05/renewable-energy-investment/\">\u201ccurrently the largest contributor to overall growth in construction in Australia\u201d</a>, helping to keep our economy moving forward. However, this boom will not continue without new policy as the renewable energy target comes to an end.</p> <p>With our economy stagnant and interest rates low, now is the time to invest in the future of Australia and in the process help ensure the survival of our neighbours.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/15/australia-removes-coal-and-climate-crisis-references-from-pacific-islands-declaration\">Australia removes climate 'crisis' from Pacific islands draft declaration</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, if the moral and economic arguments for acting on climate change are insufficient to move our recalcitrant federal government, perhaps the geopolitical argument will be more persuasive.</p> <p>China is actively working to strengthen its position in the Pacific, seeing this as a strategic location. Their efforts include <a href=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/china-pacific-island-leaders-climate-demands-legitimate/news-story/763b686cf520b0a87b1df0a8b1d1dc3d\">backing the calls by Pacific leaders to act on climate and phase-out coal</a> power, as well as direct support for infrastructure and renewable energy deployment in the Pacific. As a country that has globally committed to climate leadership, China has both the moral authority and the economic leverage to make Australia increasingly irrelevant. Scott Morison\u2019s performance at the Pacific Island Forum has not helped this situation.</p> <p>Australia\u2019s regional and global influence will not grow unless we are fair dinkum about acting on climate change. Without greater domestic action, we may be able to throw our weight around at the Pacific Islands Forum, but we will slowly lose our geopolitical, economic and moral authority in a world that has committed to act on the climate crisis.</p> <p>\u2022 Nicky Ison is a founding director of the Community Power Agency and a research associate at the Institute for Sustainable Futures at the University of Technology, Sydney</p>",

The forum was held in Tuvalu, one of the lowest lying islands on Earth, where the effects of sea level rise are already being seen. For Tuvalu, a global commitment to limiting climate change to 1.5C is literally a question of survival. By doing everything he could to water down the forum communique\u2019s climate language, the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, refused to listen to the words of Tuvalu\u2019s prime minister, Enele Sopoaga, when he urged leaders to focus on \u201csurvival, not saving the economies of countries\u201d. However, in a country like Australia, even that is a false choice. Australia more so than almost any other country has the opportunity to prosper economically through decarbonisation. We can, as they say, have our cake and eat it too. The pathway to global decarbonisation relies heavily on the shift from coal, oil and gas to renewable resources. In a decarbonised world not only do we power our homes and businesses with renewables, but we also power our cars, buses, trains and industry with wind, solar and storage. With technologies like electric vehicles, hydrogen buses and electromagnetic industrial heating, this is all eminently possible. As a country with some of the best solar and wind resources in the world, vast areas of land, a low population and manufacturing base and strong trading relationships particularly in Asia, Australia is uniquely positioned to help decarbonise our region. Indeed, it is not only our Pacific neighbours who are asking for our help. Our biggest trading partners \u2013 Japan, South Korea and Taiwan \u2013 are looking eagerly at Australia\u2019s renewable resources to help them act on climate. Already, there are plans in development to export solar energy to Singapore through a Sun Cable from the Northern Territory. Macquarie Capital is financing the development of the Asia Renewable Energy Hub in Western Australia. This project, which has recently grown to 15GW of solar and wind, will not only power the mining operations of the Pilbara and increased onshore minerals refining, it will also generate renewable hydrogen that can be exported to our neighbours. This week, Pacific leaders asked Australia to stop expanding our coal industry. As a country that has been exporting coal since 1799, this request came as an affront to our federal government. However, given that coal is the biggest cause of climate change and Australia\u2019s largest contribution, we cannot be serious about stopping climate change without planning to move beyond coal. While moving away from coal will have its challenges, it is possible. It is also better to restructure our economy deliberately, supporting those who work in the coal industry, than for these communities to be left to the whims of global market forces. Already the Latrobe Valley Authority is showing how we might do this. From electric vehicle manufacturing, to investment in transport infrastructure, to more jobs in healthcare, their efforts to diversify the economy of the Latrobe Valley in Victoria are showing progress. Restructuring our economy does not happen over night, but we need to recognise that it has already started. In the past three years $9bn have been invested in building renewable energy generation. According to Macromonitor, the renewables boom is \u201ccurrently the largest contributor to overall growth in construction in Australia\u201d, helping to keep our economy moving forward. However, this boom will not continue without new policy as the renewable energy target comes to an end. With our economy stagnant and interest rates low, now is the time to invest in the future of Australia and in the process help ensure the survival of our neighbours. However, if the moral and economic arguments for acting on climate change are insufficient to move our recalcitrant federal government, perhaps the geopolitical argument will be more persuasive. China is actively working to strengthen its position in the Pacific, seeing this as a strategic location. Their efforts include backing the calls by Pacific leaders to act on climate and phase-out coal power, as well as direct support for infrastructure and renewable energy deployment in the Pacific. As a country that has globally committed to climate leadership, China has both the moral authority and the economic leverage to make Australia increasingly irrelevant. Scott Morison\u2019s performance at the Pacific Island Forum has not helped this situation. Australia\u2019s regional and global influence will not grow unless we are fair dinkum about acting on climate change. Without greater domestic action, we may be able to throw our weight around at the Pacific Islands Forum, but we will slowly lose our geopolitical, economic and moral authority in a world that has committed to act on the climate crisis. \u2022 Nicky Ison is a founding director of the Community Power Agency and a research associate at the Institute for Sustainable Futures at the University of Technology, Sydney",

      "body": "<p>The Honor 20 Pro is the new flagship phone for Huawei\u2019s cheaper offshoot, offering some of what made the Chinese firm the camera master but at \u00a3550 it is a little overpriced.</p> <p>The Honor 20 Pro is essentially the same phone as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/10/honor-20-review-huaweis-first-new-phone-during-trump-dispute\">\u00a3400 Honor 20</a> with a better camera on the back, a slightly larger battery and more storage. It was meant to be released alongside its cheaper sibling, but Donald Trump\u2019s Huawei blockade caused it to be delayed.</p> <p>From the outside the phones are practically identical. The Honor 20 Pro is 0.5mm thicker, 0.3mm taller and 8g heavier than the Honor 20, not that you\u2019d notice. It has the same 6.26in LCD screen, which looks good but can\u2019t match the OLED screens on rivals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76c88611a9878d827e0dd66cdaed45187f26f6f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76c88611a9878d827e0dd66cdaed45187f26f6f5/963_699_3108_1866/1000.jpg\" alt=\"honor 20 pro review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The selfie camera pokes through a small hole in the screen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The same 32MP selfie camera pokes through the same-sized hole-punch notch in the top left of the display. The body has the same metal sides and glass back. The Honor 20 Pro has a nicer light-reflecting finish under the glass, but it\u2019ll probably spend most of its life in a case anyway.</p> <p>The side-mounted fingerprint scanner, which doubles as the power button, is equally great for right-handed users, but less so for those who primarily use their phone in their left. There\u2019s no headphone socket either.</p> <p>Overall the Honor 20 Pro is a good-looking, well-made phone that has a large screen, but isn\u2019t quite as massive as some of the monsters available in 2019.</p> <h2>Specifications</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong>Screen:</strong> 6.26in FHD+ LCD (412ppi)</p></li> <li><p><strong>Processor:</strong> octa-core Huawei Kirin 980</p></li> <li><p><strong>RAM:</strong> 8GB of RAM</p></li> <li><p><strong>Storage:</strong> 256GB</p></li> <li><p><strong>Operating system:</strong> Magic UI 2.1 based on Android 9 Pie</p></li> <li><p><strong>Camera:</strong> rear 48MP wide, 16MP ultra-wide, 8MP telephoto and 2MP macro, 32MP selfie</p></li> <li><p><strong>Connectivity:</strong> USB-C (2.0), LTE, wifi, NFC, Bluetooth 5 and GPS (dual-sim available in some regions)</p></li> <li><p><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 154.6 x 74 x 8.4 mm</p></li> <li><p><strong>Weight:</strong> 182g</p></li> </ul> <h2>Reliable performance and battery life</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d7b22b7ea1c03ee3005a2cff15908e447521406b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d7b22b7ea1c03ee3005a2cff15908e447521406b/242_264_3802_2282/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Honor 20 Pro phone\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The USB-C port in the bottom handles power as well as wired audio, as there\u2019s no headphone socket.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Under the hood is the same <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/10/honor-20-review-huaweis-first-new-phone-during-trump-dispute\">Kirin 980 chip as the Honor 20</a>, but the 20 Pro has 2GB more RAM (8GB total) and twice as much storage at 256GB. Unsurprisingly it performs exactly the same. I couldn\u2019t appreciate the greater amount of RAM in day-to-day usage.</p> <p>That means you get a good performing all-rounder, which feels slick in operation, but not quite as fast and smooth as the OnePlus 7 or 7 Pro. The battery also lasts a long time, managing over 36 hours between charges, enough to see me from 7am on day one to 7pm on day two \u2013 four hours longer than the Honor 20.</p> <p>There\u2019s no wireless charging on the Honor 20 Pro. Cable charging reaches 75% in an hour and a full power in less than 90 minutes.</p> <h2>Magic UI 2.1</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0d59db88c1fe8a7b28730014c352352ce6d152ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0d59db88c1fe8a7b28730014c352352ce6d152ba/440_380_4203_2523/1000.jpg\" alt=\"honor 20 pro review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Magic UI\u2019s gesture controls are in line with Google\u2019s incoming changes to Android Q with swipes in from the side replicating the back button.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Honor 20 Pro runs the exact same Android 9 Pie-based Magic UI 2.1 software as the Honor 20. It works well most of the time, is good on battery and is fairly customisable. Some might not like the look of it out of the box, but you can change most of it with themes.</p> <p>It\u2019s not as good as OxygenOS on a OnePlus nor Google\u2019s Pixel phones, but it\u2019s getting better with each software release.</p> <p>Under normal circumstances you could expect bi-monthly software updates for two to three years from release. But there\u2019s a question mark still hanging over Huawei and therefore Honor\u2019s ability to work with US companies such as Google, due to Trump\u2019s actions. Honor says it is \u201cconfident\u201d that it can <a href=\"https://www.hihonor.com/uk/honor-answers.html\">update the 20 Pro with Android Q</a>.</p> <h2>Camera</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"961e360e50ba9af91401d541be06421ce31aa99e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/961e360e50ba9af91401d541be06421ce31aa99e/334_402_4104_2464/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Honor 20 Pro phone\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The camera app on the Honor 20 Pro is easy to use, while its AI system does a solid job most of the time, tweaking colour and settings automatically.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Honor 20 Pro has the same great 48MP standard camera, with added optical image stabilisation here, fun 16MP ultra-wide angle camera and disappointing 2MP macro camera as the Honor 20. New for the Honor 20 Pro is an 8MP telephoto camera with a 3x optical zoom.</p> <p>That means you get some really good images from the main camera, well balanced with good colour and dynamic range. While overall detail is good, images look a little smooth on a highly textured surface on full crop, something most will probably never do.</p> <p>Low-light performance was also good, although not quite as game-changing as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/apr/24/huawei-p30-pro-review-leica-quad-camera-zoom\">Huawei\u2019s P30 Pro</a>. The ultra-wide angle camera is clearly inferior in less than ideal lighting conditions, but works really well in good lighting and gives you another perspective to use in your photography.</p> <p>The 8MP telephoto camera produces a 3x optical, 5x hybrid and then up to 30x digital zoom. The 3x and 5x zooms produce really good, usable images in even average light levels, getting you far closer to the action than 2x optical zooms. The Honor 20 Pro has the best zoom short of the Huawei P30 Pro, which has 5x optical zoom, 10x hybrid and 50x digital.</p> <p>Performance in video was similar to flagship rivals, although it caps out at 4K at 30 frames per second (not 60fps). While the camera app is generally easy to use, it still hives off HDR to a dedicated mode, rather than being built straight into the main photo mode. The front-facing 32MP camera pokes through a hole in the screen and is good, capturing detail-rich selfies even in fairly challenging lighting conditions.</p> <h2>Observations</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5fc30d2adb71858162b134653c2f48262f5bd2a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5fc30d2adb71858162b134653c2f48262f5bd2a9/157_375_4372_2625/1000.jpg\" alt=\"honor 20 pro review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The side-mounted fingerprint scanner is fast and easy to reach with your right thumb, but less so with your left index finger.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>The phone is pretty slippery so you\u2019ll need a case to keep it from dropping out of shallow pockets when you sit down.</p></li> <li><p>The vibration motor is not as good as rivals in 2019, feeling baggy and imprecise.</p></li> <li><p>The frame of the phone traps hairs and fluff.</p></li> <li><p>Call quality was good, but the speaker is fairly small and needs a bit of attention to get the correct alignment with your ear.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Price</h2> <p>The Honor 20 Pro costs <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07R8TXBH1\">\u00a3550</a> in either phantom black (purple) or phantom blue (green).</p> <p>For comparison, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/10/honor-20-review-huaweis-first-new-phone-during-trump-dispute\">Honor 20</a> costs <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07RQ1364R\">\u00a3400</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/01/honor-view-20-review-iphone-xs-48mp-camera-android\">Honor View20</a> costs <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07MKY35D4/\">\u00a3350</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/17/oneplus-7-review-competition-beating-performance-for-less\">OnePlus 7</a> costs <a href=\"https://www.oneplus.com/uk/oneplus-7\">\u00a3499</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/apr/24/huawei-p30-pro-review-leica-quad-camera-zoom\">Huawei P30 Pro</a> costs <a href=\"https://www.johnlewis.com/huawei-p30-pro-8-with-reverse-wireless-charge-android-8gb-ram-6-47-inch-4g-lte-sim-free-128gb/p4211038\">\u00a3899</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jun/18/samsung-galaxy-s10e-review-the-cheaper-one\">Samsung Galaxy S10e</a> costs <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/uk/smartphones/galaxy-s10e-sm-g970-hybrid-sim/SM-G970FZWDBTU/buy/\">\u00a3669</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/31/iphone-xr-review-apple-big-bezels-battery-face-id-screen\">Apple iPhone XR</a> costs <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-xr\">\u00a3749</a>.</p> <h2>Verdict</h2> <p>The Honor 20 Pro offers a lot of camera for \u00a3550, getting you closer to the action and with a greater versatility than some phones that cost twice as much.</p> <p>The rest of the phone is good too. It\u2019s slick, isn\u2019t enormous, has top performance and long battery life. The software is solid too, but there\u2019s still the Trump-China trade war <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/02/global-markets-take-fright-as-trump-ramps-up-us-china-trade-war\">lingering over things</a> that could cause issues with Android security and version updates <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/06/trump-hints-he-is-ready-to-dig-in-for-long-us-china-trade-war\">should it escalate</a>.</p> <p>The two biggest problems with the Honor 20 Pro are its price and the existence of its non-Pro sibling. You get the same experience minus the camera zoom with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/10/honor-20-review-huaweis-first-new-phone-during-trump-dispute\">vanilla Honor 20</a> for \u00a3150 less, which also undercuts the best of the competition: namely the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/17/oneplus-7-review-competition-beating-performance-for-less\">\u00a3499 OnePlus 7</a>.

      "bodyText": "The Honor 20 Pro is the new flagship phone for Huawei\u2019s cheaper offshoot, offering some of what made the Chinese firm the camera master but at \u00a3550 it is a little overpriced. The Honor 20 Pro is essentially the same phone as the \u00a3400 Honor 20 with a better camera on the back, a slightly larger battery and more storage. It was meant to be released alongside its cheaper sibling, but Donald Trump\u2019s Huawei blockade caused it to be delayed. From the outside the phones are practically identical. The Honor 20 Pro is 0.5mm thicker, 0.3mm taller and 8g heavier than the Honor 20, not that you\u2019d notice. It has the same 6.26in LCD screen, which looks good but can\u2019t match the OLED screens on rivals. The same 32MP selfie camera pokes through the same-sized hole-punch notch in the top left of the display. The body has the same metal sides and glass back. The Honor 20 Pro has a nicer light-reflecting finish under the glass, but it\u2019ll probably spend most of its life in a case anyway. The side-mounted fingerprint scanner, which doubles as the power button, is equally great for right-handed users, but less so for those who primarily use their phone in their left. There\u2019s no headphone socket either. Overall the Honor 20 Pro is a good-looking, well-made phone that has a large screen, but isn\u2019t quite as massive as some of the monsters available in 2019. Specifications Screen: 6.26in FHD+ LCD (412ppi) Processor: octa-core Huawei Kirin 980 RAM: 8GB of RAM Storage: 256GB Operating system: Magic UI 2.1 based on Android 9 Pie Camera: rear 48MP wide, 16MP ultra-wide, 8MP telephoto and 2MP macro, 32MP selfie Connectivity: USB-C (2.0), LTE, wifi, NFC, Bluetooth 5 and GPS (dual-sim available in some regions) Dimensions: 154.6 x 74 x 8.4 mm Weight: 182g Reliable performance and battery life Under the hood is the same Kirin 980 chip as the Honor 20, but the 20 Pro has 2GB more RAM (8GB total) and twice as much storage at 256GB. Unsurprisingly it performs exactly the same. I couldn\u2019t appreciate the greater amount of RAM in day-to-day usage. That means you get a good performing all-rounder, which feels slick in operation, but not quite as fast and smooth as the OnePlus 7 or 7 Pro. The battery also lasts a long time, managing over 36 hours between charges, enough to see me from 7am on day one to 7pm on day two \u2013 four hours longer than the Honor 20. There\u2019s no wireless charging on the Honor 20 Pro. Cable charging reaches 75% in an hour and a full power in less than 90 minutes. Magic UI 2.1 The Honor 20 Pro runs the exact same Android 9 Pie-based Magic UI 2.1 software as the Honor 20. It works well most of the time, is good on battery and is fairly customisable. Some might not like the look of it out of the box, but you can change most of it with themes. It\u2019s not as good as OxygenOS on a OnePlus nor Google\u2019s Pixel phones, but it\u2019s getting better with each software release. Under normal circumstances you could expect bi-monthly software updates for two to three years from release. But there\u2019s a question mark still hanging over Huawei and therefore Honor\u2019s ability to work with US companies such as Google, due to Trump\u2019s actions. Honor says it is \u201cconfident\u201d that it can update the 20 Pro with Android Q. Camera The Honor 20 Pro has the same great 48MP standard camera, with added optical image stabilisation here, fun 16MP ultra-wide angle camera and disappointing 2MP macro camera as the Honor 20. New for the Honor 20 Pro is an 8MP telephoto camera with a 3x optical zoom. That means you get some really good images from the main camera, well balanced with good colour and dynamic range. While overall detail is good, images look a little smooth on a highly textured surface on full crop, something most will probably never do. Low-light performance was also good, although not quite as game-changing as Huawei\u2019s P30 Pro. The ultra-wide angle camera is clearly inferior in less than ideal lighting conditions, but works really well in good lighting and gives you another perspective to use in your photography. The 8MP telephoto camera produces a 3x optical, 5x hybrid and then up to 30x digital zoom. The 3x and 5x zooms produce really good, usable images in even average light levels, getting you far closer to the action than 2x optical zooms. The Honor 20 Pro has the best zoom short of the Huawei P30 Pro, which has 5x optical zoom, 10x hybrid and 50x digital. Performance in video was similar to flagship rivals, although it caps out at 4K at 30 frames per second (not 60fps). While the camera app is generally easy to use, it still hives off HDR to a dedicated mode, rather than being built straight into the main photo mode. The front-facing 32MP camera pokes through a hole in the screen and is good, capturing detail-rich selfies even in fairly challenging lighting conditions. Observations The phone is pretty slippery so you\u2019ll need a case to keep it from dropping out of shallow pockets when you sit down. The vibration motor is not as good as rivals in 2019, feeling baggy and imprecise. The frame of the phone traps hairs and fluff. Call quality was good, but the speaker is fairly small and needs a bit of attention to get the correct alignment with your ear. Price The Honor 20 Pro costs \u00a3550 in either phantom black (purple) or phantom blue (green). For comparison, the Honor 20 costs \u00a3400, Honor View20 costs \u00a3350, the OnePlus 7 costs \u00a3499, the Huawei P30 Pro costs \u00a3899, the Samsung Galaxy S10e costs \u00a3669 and the Apple iPhone XR costs \u00a3749. Verdict The Honor 20 Pro offers a lot of camera for \u00a3550, getting you closer to the action and with a greater versatility than some phones that cost twice as much. The rest of the phone is good too. It\u2019s slick, isn\u2019t enormous, has top performance and long battery life. The software is solid too, but there\u2019s still the Trump-China trade war lingering over things that could cause issues with Android security and version updates should it escalate. The two biggest problems with the Honor 20 Pro are its price and the existence of its non-Pro sibling. You get the same experience minus the camera zoom with the vanilla Honor 20 for \u00a3150 less, which also undercuts the best of the competition: namely the \u00a3499 OnePlus 7. I would argue the Honor 20 Pro is therefore \u00a350 too expensive. So the question is whether the Honor 20 Pro\u2019s optical zoom is worth the extra money. If you\u2019re after one of the most capable and adaptable camera systems on your phone for less than \u00a3600 then yes. If not there is better value to be had elsewhere. Pros: hole-punch notch, snappy performance, good battery life, cracking camera, good screen, dual-sim, fast fingerprint sensor. Cons: Magic UI not to everyone\u2019s taste, slow updates, Trump, no expandable storage, no water resistance, no wireless charging, no headphone socket, right-side fingerprint sensor not for left-handed.

Event Horizon has such a splattery reputation that doubling down on the gore-orgies and improvised body modification would be the obvious thing to do. (The film\u2019s signature line \u2013 \u201cWhere we\u2019re going, we don\u2019t need eyes to see\u201d \u2013 comes after a particularly gruesome bit of self-surgery.)

The original film was set in 2047 but on our current timeline we might need Sam Neill to genuinely invent faster-than-light space travel before then to guarantee humankind\u2019s survival. Or maybe Wingard could lean into a juicy twist: his experimental starship successfully warps to a place that is so hellish it drives you insane \u2026 but it is actually just visiting our current universe.</p>",

Horror novels have also been gleefully filleted, from Netflix\u2019s unsettling hit The Haunting of Hill House to AMC\u2019s limo-driven boogeyman NOS4A2 and FX\u2019s hinge-jawed vampire nightmare The Strain. Genre godhead Stephen King even has his own mashed-up mini-universe in the form of Hulu\u2019s Castle Rock (available on Amazon in the UK). After a cluster of relatively straight-faced efforts, including a gloomy expansion of The Exorcist that lasted two seasons and the unexpectedly good Psycho spin-off Bates Motel, the recent surge of film-to-TV horror adaptations seem to have steered hard into shlock. Some of the results have been entertaining (such as Starz\u2019s Ash Vs Evil Dead, a gleeful expansion of Sam Raimi\u2019s original) while others (notably MTV\u2019s seemingly unkillable Scream reboot, now on its third season) seem merely shrill. While technically an original series, Ryan Murphy\u2019s Scream Queens took most of its campy cues from well-worn slasher movie tropes, while the upcoming American Horror Story: 1984 \u2013 the ninth season of Murphy\u2019s sturdy horror anthology \u2013 is set in a kitsch sleepaway camp familiar to anyone who has ever watched a Friday the 13th flick. Wingard is in the captain\u2019s chair of his cursed starship, so is free to plot whatever course he wishes. Event Horizon has such a splattery reputation that doubling down on the gore-orgies and improvised body modification would be the obvious thing to do. (The film\u2019s signature line \u2013 \u201cWhere we\u2019re going, we don\u2019t need eyes to see\u201d \u2013 comes after a particularly gruesome bit of self-surgery.) But it also feels like a potential opportunity to speak to the current political and cultural moment. An event horizon is essentially a point of no return, and we are currently being bombarded with grave messages of environmental tipping points reached and societal red lines breached. The original film was set in 2047 but on our current timeline we might need Sam Neill to genuinely invent faster-than-light space travel before then to guarantee humankind\u2019s survival. Or maybe Wingard could lean into a juicy twist: his experimental starship successfully warps to a place that is so hellish it drives you insane \u2026 but it is actually just visiting our current universe.",

      "body": "<p>In the early 1930s a young William Laker would cycle the 50-odd miles from his home in Kent to Crystal Palace in south London to visit the woman who would, half a century later, become my grandmother.</p> <p>There is every chance Grandpa would have popped into the small bike shop at 3&amp;5 Central Hill in Crystal Palace. That very shop remained open for about 97 years, serving generations of cyclists, but in July the current custodian of what is now called Blue Door Bicycles, David Hibbs, announced it is to close its door for good.</p> <p>It\u2019s not the only centenarian cycle shop closing this summer. The shop my first childhood bikes came from, and the one I still used, Ralph Colman Cycles in Taunton, closed abruptly in July after 94 years of selling and servicing cycles.</p> <p>What we lose when we lose a bike shop depends very much on the shop. It could simply be a trusted place we take our bikes for servicing \u2013 but it can be so much more. It may be a core part of the community, a place for invaluable advice, a planner of events and even holidays, a sponsor of the local cycling club \u2013 and a meeting place that also serves cracking coffee.</p> <p>When you ask people what a bike shop means to them, responses range from overt enthusiasm for well-loved local shops and their staff, to apathy about so-so retailers, to tales of bike shops that helped riders far from home. To many, a sign of a good shop is somewhere that has a \u201clittle box of weird spares\u201d, or a place that can repair ailing parts, rather than replacing them.

      "bodyText": "In the early 1930s a young William Laker would cycle the 50-odd miles from his home in Kent to Crystal Palace in south London to visit the woman who would, half a century later, become my grandmother. There is every chance Grandpa would have popped into the small bike shop at 3&amp;5 Central Hill in Crystal Palace. That very shop remained open for about 97 years, serving generations of cyclists, but in July the current custodian of what is now called Blue Door Bicycles, David Hibbs, announced it is to close its door for good. It\u2019s not the only centenarian cycle shop closing this summer. The shop my first childhood bikes came from, and the one I still used, Ralph Colman Cycles in Taunton, closed abruptly in July after 94 years of selling and servicing cycles. What we lose when we lose a bike shop depends very much on the shop. It could simply be a trusted place we take our bikes for servicing \u2013 but it can be so much more. It may be a core part of the community, a place for invaluable advice, a planner of events and even holidays, a sponsor of the local cycling club \u2013 and a meeting place that also serves cracking coffee. When you ask people what a bike shop means to them, responses range from overt enthusiasm for well-loved local shops and their staff, to apathy about so-so retailers, to tales of bike shops that helped riders far from home. To many, a sign of a good shop is somewhere that has a \u201clittle box of weird spares\u201d, or a place that can repair ailing parts, rather than replacing them. Somewhere you get to know and trust staff, and somewhere they turn around servicing in a day \u201cbecause they know you ride your bike for transport\u201d. While some shops appear to be thriving, others clearly are struggling. Hibbs cited rising rents and the stranglehold of internet discounts in the shop\u2019s closure \u2013 a familiar refrain. As he put it: \u201cWe tried to do it properly, we have been open seven days a week, from 8am to 6.30pm during the week, so we could provide people with a service. We had some great, loyal customers but not enough to pay, sadly.\u201d No one keeps track of how many bike shops are closing, but bicycle import figures, a reliable sales barometer for a country that no longer builds cycle frames en masse, suggest the industry is having a tough time. In 2018 the UK imported 2.2m bikes, which the Bicycle Association\u2019s Steve Garidis describes as a \u201csubstantial contraction\u201d from the 3.5m imported in 2014. \u201cThe bike industry is basically the same as it was 20 years ago,\u201d says Garidis. \u201cFive years ago, it was 3.5m, so you\u2019re really talking a massive drop.\u201d Garidis says with the number of cycling enthusiasts fairly static over time, an obvious possible growth area is cycle commuters. The problem there is most people are too scared to cycle on Britain\u2019s roads \u2013 mainly citing a lack of safe infrastructure and fear of motor traffic. What\u2019s more, a recent Bicycle Association report says the UK is largely missing out on the e-bike boom seen in Europe due to a lack of product knowledge and the absence of government incentives for green transport that many European countries offer. We may be able to buy cheap parts, trawl through reviews and find a product we think we will like online, but it\u2019s only in a bike shop you can hold items in your hands, try them on, and ask (hopefully) friendly, knowledgeable staff about them. Conversations can lead to useful nuggets, from local events and routes, to cycling news. One well-loved bike shop I spoke to even recommends tailored servicing schedules based on customers\u2019 individual mileage and the type of riding they\u2019re doing. You can\u2019t get that online.

The most notorious detention facility is in Al Dayer, in southern Saudi Arabia\u2019s Jizan region. \u201cThese are some of the worst conditions I\u2019ve ever heard of \u2013 really the whole nine yards,\u201d said Coogle. Former detainees reported abuses such as chaining inmates together; cells with overflowing toilets, forcing inmates to sit in faeces and urine; food thrown through cell windows so that inmates fight over scraps; prohibiting Muslims from praying, and tearing crosses off the necklaces of Christian inmates; and an absence of clean water or sanitation. Former detainee Abdulrahim Sofian told the Guardian that guards trod on his back as a form of punishment, and repeatedly called him and other detainees \u201cdogs\u201d or \u201canimals\u201d. Like Tayib, his possessions, including clothes, were confiscated: \u201cWe left everything there,\u201d he said, wearing an Ethiopian Airlines blanket as a shawl. Saudi authorities are also accused of detaining and deporting minors, despite the country having signed and ratified the convention on the rights of the child, which indicates that children should not be detained on account of their migration status. \u201cChildren are among the several thousands of people arriving each week from Saudi Arabia and we are particularly worried about them as they require special protection and social assistance,\u201d said Mohamed Morchid, country director for M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res in Ethiopia. A Saudi official denied the allegation: \u201cChildren are not deported except with their parents, and children are not subject to any penalty. \u201cChildren whose parents are not known are kept in social care facilities with Saudi children.\u201d IOM figures show that 6% of those returned since March 2017 were minors, though aid workers said the prevalence of false documentation means the true figure may be higher. The Guardian spoke to two deportees who said they were 15 years old, though the laissez-passer documents (\u201csafe conduct\u201d passes) granted by the Saudi authorities claimed they were adults. There are very few organisations in the capital able to take care of minors, which means the majority end up on the streets shortly after arriving back in Ethiopia. Ethiopia has drawn close to Saudi Arabia since Abiy Ahmed made the kingdom his first overseas visit \u2013 and accepted offers of financial aid \u2013 after he became prime minister last year. \u201cIt is clear the Ethiopian government doesn\u2019t want to make any issue with the Saudis about this,\u201d said one aid worker. Berhanu Aberra, director for overseas employment at Ethiopia\u2019s ministry of labour and social affairs, said his government was working \u201cwith the respective Saudi bodies to respect and protect the dignity, rights and safety of our citizens\u201d and to ensure all are \u201ctreated safely until back home\u201d. The Ethiopian government has also spoken warmly of Saudi Arabia as a partner, noting that it is paying for transport for deportees. But aid agencies said they need more support. The IOM has estimated that $23.8m (\u00a319.6m) is needed to assist returnees with reintegration efforts. Last year, Saudi Arabia reportedly promised $30m to help but this has not yet materialised. The EU has refused to offer funding to assist with returns to Ethiopia from the Gulf. Meanwhile, despite the dangers, migrants from Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa continue to make the journey to Saudi Arabia in persistently large numbers. Danielle Botti of the Mixed Migration Centre said the number of arrivals in Yemen in April and May \u2013 at least 18,000 a month \u2013 were the highest recorded since 2006. The MMC estimates that more than 10% of these could be making repeat journeys. \u201cWhat they need is social support,\u201d said one aid worker. \u201cBecause otherwise they go again and again.\u201d",

Biggs is a combat veteran and a former employee of the conspiracy broadcaster Alex Jones\u2019s Infowars network. He claims that up to 1,000 people from around the country will attend Saturday\u2019s unpermitted event on the city\u2019s waterfront. In promoting the rally on social media, Biggs has brandished a Trump-themed baseball bat, appeared in videos wearing a T-shirt bearing the slogan \u201cTraining to Throw Communists Out of Helicopters\u201d \u2013 a reference to the Chilean Pinochet regime\u2019s methods for executing dissidents \u2013 and has taunted antifascists, saying \u201cYou\u2019re not gonna feel safe when you go out in public\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m gonna stomp your ass into the ground, Antifa\u201d. In more recent days, Biggs has urged supporters to tone down their rhetoric after notifying them on Facebook that he had received a visit from the FBI. The Proud Boys are a \u201cwestern chauvinist\u201d fraternity, founded by the activist Gavin McInnes, who have been involved in previous episodes of street violence in the city. The Southern Poverty Law Center describes them as a hate group. The group, which is banned from most mainstream social media platforms, has been encouraging its members to make the trip to Portland for the event on its Telegram channel, an encrypted messaging service. Other rightwing groups have also said they are attending, or have been mentioned by Biggs and others, including \u201cpatriot movement\u201d groups like the Three Percenters and the Oathkeepers, who often openly carry firearms at public events, and American Guard, who the Anti-Defamation League describe as \u201chardcore white supremacists\u201d. The rally has also been heavily promoted in conservative media outlets along with its underlying message \u2013 the claim that anti-fascist groups, known as \u201cantifa\u201d, are domestic terrorists. Rightwing groups have framed the event as a response to an incident during the last rightwing rally in the city, on 29 June, in which the conservative writer Andy Ngo had milkshakes thrown at him and was punched by several masked protesters. Ngo was briefly hospitalized. The background to the latest potential confrontation is a long string of violent rallies since 2017 in which rightwing organizers, often living outside the city, have brought in activists and supporters to square off against leftwing counter-protesters. Several anti-fascist groups have made calls for people to attend a counter-protest to the rally, including the protest group PopMob, which is promising a poop emoji costume parade and a brass band. Elsewhere, Rose City Antifa , one of the longest-standing anti-fascist groups in the country, made a call on its website for \u201cthe community to defend itself\u201d. The city, meanwhile, has attempted to rally community groups behind a message of no tolerance for violence. Speakers at an event organized to promote this message last week included the Portland police chief, Danielle Outlaw. Outlaw and Portland\u2019s mayor, Ted Wheeler, have each told people intending violence to stay away. \u201cDon\u2019t come. We don\u2019t want you here,\u201d Outlaw said last week. The message has been underscored by the consequences meted out in the last week over previous, related events. On Thursday, Joey Gibson, leader of the Patriot Prayer group, became the fifth person charged over an episode of political violence earlier in the year. Gibson was caught on several video streams allegedly leading a May Day attack on Cider Riot, a bar popular with the city\u2019s left. This incident is the subject of a million-dollar lawsuit by the bar\u2019s owners against Gibson and other defendants. The FBI and the Oregon State Police have said they will assist local city police with enforcement on Saturday, and Wheeler has suggested he may ask the state governor to call out the National Guard.",

Thomas Jefferson, a slaveowner himself, penned those lines rejecting slavery; he removed the reference after receiving criticism from a number of delegates who enslaved black people. This could represent \u201cthe fabric of the American political economy\u201d ever since, some historians have said.</p> <p>Slavery flourished initially in the tobacco fields of Virginia, Maryland and North Carolina. In the tobacco-producing areas of those states, slaves constituted more than 50% of the population by 1776. Slavery then spread to the rice plantations further south. In South Carolina, African Americans remained a majority into the 20th century, according to census data.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/tools/tables/embed/index.html?spreadsheet=1u9C2AwUFVpym5_BdfRsidLMWbHW0bgMgWjDhl1YsWso\" data-alt=\"slave labor crops\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/tools/tables/embed/index.html?spreadsheet=1u9C2AwUFVpym5_BdfRsidLMWbHW0bgMgWjDhl1YsWso\">slave labor crops</a> <figcaption>Guardian graphic | Source: Kolchin, Peter.

Southern states said they wanted to secede to protect states\u2019 rights, but they were really fighting to keep people enslaved. Lincoln took on the fight for the freedom of slaves, some historians have suggested, because he was worried the British would support the south in its self-declared self-determination and recognize the south as a separate entity. If he had made the war about ending slavery, it would have looked bad for the south\u2019s fight and the British supporting its cause. Lincoln\u2019s death was probably the first casualty of \u201ca long civil rights movement that is not yet over\u201d, the historian Peter Kolchin has suggested.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4cb7df832bbc6adf4526422e241165010ae37f18\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4cb7df832bbc6adf4526422e241165010ae37f18/0_0_3433_2281/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The first edition of President Lincoln\u2019s emancipation proclamation which declared that slaves in rebel areas would be \u2018henceforth and forever free\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The first edition of Lincoln\u2019s emancipation proclamation which declared that slaves in rebel areas would be \u2018henceforth and forever free\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MPI/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>1868</strong></h2> <p>Some experts have argued that Reconstruction laid the foundation for \u201cthe organization of new segregated institutions, white supremacist ideologies, legal rationalizations, extra-legal violence and everyday racial terror\u201d \u2013 further widening the racial divide among blacks and whites. Others have pointed out that the end of the war left black Americans free but their status \u201cundetermined\u201d, with the passing of \u201ccodes\u201d to prevent black people from being truly free.</p> <p>But eventually, under the 14th amendment, African American men were granted the right to vote. Also, African Americans were extended birthright citizenship: that extends to descendants of freed black slaves and immigrants to present day.</p> <h2><strong>1898</strong></h2> <p>The recession of the late 19th century hit the US. Knight riders went out in the dark, burning the homes of African Americans who bought their own land. They rode up to Washington to demand change as southern white Democrats rolled back many of the albeit limited freedoms from Reconstruction just a couple of decades before.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Jim Crow era\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;h2 style=&quot;border-bottom: 1px solid #c70000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Guardian Egyptian Web',serif; background-color: #c70000; color: #fff; margin-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 4px; padding-right: 4px; font-weight: 900;&quot;&gt;Jim Crow era&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;style&gt; span { font-size: 34px; line-height: 1.1; } @media screen and (min-width: 360px) { span { font-size: 54px; } } &lt;/style&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The Jim Crow era of segregation forbade African Americans from drinking from the same water fountains, eating at the same restaurants or attending the same schools as white Americans \u2013 all lasting until, and sometimes well past, the 1960s.</p> <h2><strong>1926</strong></h2> <p>As African Americans were shut out of jobs and opportunities during Jim Crow, and as more jobs became available in the north and midwest, more than 2 million southern African Americans migrated after the first world war. Still, even hundreds of miles away from southern segregation, these migrating Americans were met by \u201csundown towns\u201d, where black people were not welcome after sunset, and by restrictions on where they could live in cities.</p> <p>Oregon\u2019s constitution, for example, only removed its exclusionary clause, prohibiting black people to enter the state, in 1926.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f4881ed71d3c404f27e861fce3f8fdac39b2aa65\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4881ed71d3c404f27e861fce3f8fdac39b2aa65/0_0_5020_3379/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man drinking at a \u2018colored\u2019 water cooler at a bus terminal in Oklahoma City in July 1939.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"673\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man drinking at a \u2018colored\u2019 water cooler at a bus terminal in Oklahoma City in July 1939.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Russell Lee for the Farm Security Administration/Universal via Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>1954</strong></h2> <p>In the lead-up to the end of Jim Crow and the civil rights era, the fight continued. For example: only in 1948 did the US military desegregate, by executive order. In 1954, in the Brown v Board of Education ruling, the supreme court ruled that segregation was unconstitutional and schools would have to integrate. Civil rights leaders led anti-segregation marches across the country in the 1960s. In 1964, President Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act into law. Bussing African American children to white schools in white neighborhoods was deemed constitutional.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"db6b4cebd9effe4c45d11927bbf4746548906c72\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db6b4cebd9effe4c45d11927bbf4746548906c72/0_120_2820_3523/800.jpg\" alt=\"African Americans vote for the first time since 1890 in the 1946 Georgia Democratic primary.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">African Americans vote for the first time since 1890 in the 1946 Georgia Democratic primary.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bettmann Archive/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>1965</strong></h2> <p>\u201cSlavery was gone but Jim Crow was alive.

      "bodyText": "Many Americans\u2019 introduction to US history is the arrival of 102 passengers on the Mayflower in 1620. But a year earlier, 20 enslaved Africans were brought to the British colonies against their will. As John Rolfe noted in a letter in 1619, \u201c20 and odd negroes\u201d were brought by a Dutch ship to the nascent British colonies, arriving at what is now Fort Hampton, then Point Comfort, in Virginia. Though enslaved Africans had been part of Portuguese, Spanish, French and British history across the Americas since the 16th century, the captives who landed in Virginia were probably the first slaves to arrive into what would become the United States 150 years later. Four hundred years on, the captives\u2019 arrival has informed nearly every major moment in American history, even if that history has been framed around anyone but Africans and African Americans. \u201cHistorians, elected political figures [and] community leaders would prefer to sort of imagine the United States as a kind of mythic, Anglo-Saxon Christian place,\u201d says Michael Guasco, an early American history professor at Davidson College. In 1992, Toni Morrison told the Guardian: \u201cIn this country, American means white. Everybody else has to hyphenate.\u201d 1619 After the first captives were forced on to Virginia\u2019s shores by a Dutchman in 1619, the majority of the country remained white and relied mainly on the labor of Native American slaves and white European indentured servants. It was not until the end of the 17th century that the transatlantic slave trade made its impact on the American colonies. 1661 The first anti-miscegenation statute \u2013 prohibiting marriage between races \u2013 was written into law in Maryland in 1661, shortly after enslaved people were brought to the colonies. By the 1960s, 21 states, most of them in the south, still had those laws in place. Alabama was the last state to repeal the ban on interracial marriage, in 2000. 1776 The Declaration of Independence, which embraced in its first lines \u201cthat all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights\u201d, did not extend that right to slaves, Africans or African Americans, with the final version scrapping a reference to the denunciation of slavery. Thomas Jefferson, a slaveowner himself, penned those lines rejecting slavery; he removed the reference after receiving criticism from a number of delegates who enslaved black people. This could represent \u201cthe fabric of the American political economy\u201d ever since, some historians have said. Slavery flourished initially in the tobacco fields of Virginia, Maryland and North Carolina. In the tobacco-producing areas of those states, slaves constituted more than 50% of the population by 1776. Slavery then spread to the rice plantations further south. In South Carolina, African Americans remained a majority into the 20th century, according to census data. 1860 The British-operated slave trade across the Atlantic was one of the biggest businesses of the 18th century. Approximately 600,000 of 10 million African slaves made their way into the American colonies before the slave trade \u2013 not slavery \u2013 was banned by Congress in 1808. By 1860, though, the US recorded nearly 4 million enslaved black people \u2013 13% of the population \u2013 in the country as the American-born population grew. Eight of the first 12 US presidents were slave owners. Proponents of slavery supported the efforts of groups like the American Colonization Society, who \u201csent back\u201d tens of thousands of free black people \u2013 most of them American-born \u2013 to Liberia in the 19th century to prevent disruption caused by free descendants of slaves. 1865 According to Abraham Lincoln, the civil war was fought to keep America whole, and not for the abolition of slavery \u2013 at least initially. Southern states said they wanted to secede to protect states\u2019 rights, but they were really fighting to keep people enslaved. Lincoln took on the fight for the freedom of slaves, some historians have suggested, because he was worried the British would support the south in its self-declared self-determination and recognize the south as a separate entity. If he had made the war about ending slavery, it would have looked bad for the south\u2019s fight and the British supporting its cause. Lincoln\u2019s death was probably the first casualty of \u201ca long civil rights movement that is not yet over\u201d, the historian Peter Kolchin has suggested. 1868 Some experts have argued that Reconstruction laid the foundation for \u201cthe organization of new segregated institutions, white supremacist ideologies, legal rationalizations, extra-legal violence and everyday racial terror\u201d \u2013 further widening the racial divide among blacks and whites. Others have pointed out that the end of the war left black Americans free but their status \u201cundetermined\u201d, with the passing of \u201ccodes\u201d to prevent black people from being truly free. But eventually, under the 14th amendment, African American men were granted the right to vote. Also, African Americans were extended birthright citizenship: that extends to descendants of freed black slaves and immigrants to present day. 1898 The recession of the late 19th century hit the US. Knight riders went out in the dark, burning the homes of African Americans who bought their own land. They rode up to Washington to demand change as southern white Democrats rolled back many of the albeit limited freedoms from Reconstruction just a couple of decades before. The Jim Crow era of segregation forbade African Americans from drinking from the same water fountains, eating at the same restaurants or attending the same schools as white Americans \u2013 all lasting until, and sometimes well past, the 1960s. 1926 As African Americans were shut out of jobs and opportunities during Jim Crow, and as more jobs became available in the north and midwest, more than 2 million southern African Americans migrated after the first world war. Still, even hundreds of miles away from southern segregation, these migrating Americans were met by \u201csundown towns\u201d, where black people were not welcome after sunset, and by restrictions on where they could live in cities. Oregon\u2019s constitution, for example, only removed its exclusionary clause, prohibiting black people to enter the state, in 1926. 1954 In the lead-up to the end of Jim Crow and the civil rights era, the fight continued. For example: only in 1948 did the US military desegregate, by executive order. In 1954, in the Brown v Board of Education ruling, the supreme court ruled that segregation was unconstitutional and schools would have to integrate. Civil rights leaders led anti-segregation marches across the country in the 1960s. In 1964, President Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act into law. Bussing African American children to white schools in white neighborhoods was deemed constitutional. 1965 \u201cSlavery was gone but Jim Crow was alive. Almost all southern African Americans were shut out of the ballot box and the political power it could yield,\u201d wrote Edward E Baptist in The Half Has Never Been Told: Slavery and the Making of American Capitalism. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 attempted to correct this, prohibiting racial discrimination in voting and placing restrictions on a number of southern states if they tried to change voting rights laws. Those restrictions were recently overturned in a 2013 supreme court ruling. Since the publication, in 2014, of The Case for Reparations, by Ta-Nehisi Coates, the subject of how to settle the financial debts of 250 years of slavery has risen up the political agenda. Those arguing for a financial settlement to descendants of slaves say it is designed to address the racial inequality that still lingers in the US.

      "body": "<p>During the Obama years, Portland was widely seen as a redoubt of crunchy, progressive, west coast liberalism. Much of the world saw the city through the lens of Portlandia, a TV sketch show that lampooned hipsters, cyclists and fussy diners. The city was viewed as a liberal, cultural centre of the US \u2013 and a sharp contrast with more traditional conservative parts of the country. Its laid-back image was frequently satirised, not least by the comedian Fred Armisen, who said: \u201cIt\u2019s where young people go to retire.\u201d</p> <p>Portlandia was more a caricature than a portrait, and locals noted what it left out \u2013 rapid gentrification and displacement, increasing homelessness, the contentious policing of the Portland police bureau (PPB) and the long racist history in the Pacific north-west that made Portland the whitest major city in America. The former NBA player Greg Oden said of his time playing in Portland: \u201cIt isn\u2019t a great city to live in if you\u2019re a young African American male with a lot of money.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/11/el-paso-shooting-white-supremacy-8chan-voter-suppression\">How white supremacy went mainstream in the US: 8chan, Trump, voter suppression</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even as Portlandia\u2019s run was ending, a darker picture of the city was being painted, often by outsiders.</p> <p>This weekend will see the latest in a long line of far-right gatherings that have plagued the city over the last few years. Various groups, including the most visible, the Proud Boys, will descend on the downtown area. Once again they will be met by leftist counter-protesters.

And the Portlandia image has some basis in truth \u2013 the city has developed a diverse service economy notable for its craft breweries, cafes, restaurants and artisanal goods.</p> <p>But the Oregon hinterland is deeply conservative, and Portland itself has long been a target for far-right organising. In the 1980s and 1990s, neo-Nazi skinheads converged in the streets, and a gang killed an Ethiopian immigrant, Mulugeta Seraw, in 1988.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d3defd30994e887782ebf0d9e969d94e9a6316e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3defd30994e887782ebf0d9e969d94e9a6316e1/0_173_2592_1555/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police use pepper spray as multiple groups including Rose City Antifa and the Proud Boys in downtown Portland, Oregon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police use pepper spray as multiple groups including Rose City Antifa and the Proud Boys in downtown Portland, Oregon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Killen/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A number of far-right groups have placed themselves at the center of more recent events. One, Patriot Prayer, is led by Joey Gibson, who lives across the Columbia river in Vancouver, Washington. Gibson has organized about 18 rallies in Portland since 2017, some of which have degenerated into violence.</p> <p>On Thursday, Gibson became the fifth person arrested in just over a week as a result of a raid in May on Cider Riot, a bar popular with the left. He was charged with rioting, a felony.</p> <p>Last July, Gibson told conspiracy broadcaster Alex Jones: \u201cPortland is one of the worst cities in this country. It\u2019s full of so much darkness. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so motivated to go there.\u201d</p> <p>Every event Gibson has organised in Portland has been met by a counter-protest, and these have generally been far larger than the rightwing crowds. Opposition to the rallies acquired a new impetus in May 2017, after Jeremy Christian allegedly showered passengers on a commuter train with racial abuse, and then allegedly stabbed three men who came to their aid, killing two. Christian, who has been charged with aggravated murder, had attended a \u201cfree speech\u201d rally organized by Gibson the previous month draped in an American flag and making fascist salutes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d0cd27189398273ba611566a713c620f2a32a538\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d0cd27189398273ba611566a713c620f2a32a538/0_270_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joey Gibson stands with far-right demonstrators in Portland, last year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joey Gibson stands with far-right demonstrators in Portland, last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomas Patterson/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Local anti-fascist groups, especially Rose City Antifa, have produced photographic evidence that early on Gibson\u2019s rallies were attracting local extremists from white nationalist groups.</p> <p>But it is another group which has become increasingly central to Portland\u2019s rightwing protests: the Proud Boys. The \u201cwestern chauvinist\u201d fraternity, established by the Vice co-founder Gavin McInnes in 2015, has been involved in street violence throughout the US. Trials are ongoing after an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/nyregion/proud-boys-nypd.html\">incident</a> in New York City last year where 10 members of the group were caught on video beating anti-fascists at the conclusion of a McInnes speech.</p> <p>The group has been particularly active in the Pacific north-west. They first cooperated with Gibson in the events he organized, until a reported split. Men in Proud Boys colours were closely involved in one of the worst incidents of political street violence in Portland\u2019s recent history, in June last year.</p> <p> This weekend, the Proud Boys are front and center again. The main organizer is Joe Biggs, a combat veteran and former Alex Jones employee who prominently displays the Proud Boys logo on his Facebook page.</p> <p>Biggs has been banned from many platforms after issuing threats ahead of the rally. In a Periscope video, he warned anti-fascists, or \u201cantifa\u201d: \u201cEvery time you turn your shoulder or your head, you look over, you\u2019re always gonna feel like myself or someone else is gonna be there looking, because that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d</p> <p>Wheeler, the mayor, laid some of the blame for this far-right resurgence at the feet of Donald Trump.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening on the streets of Portland, or what\u2019s happening on the streets of any other community in this country, is not removed from the national trend that we\u2019re seeing,\u201d Wheeler said. \u201cOne has to acknowledge that our president has given life to that kind of hostility, that kind of hate speech.\u201d</p> <p>But the right seems not to hear it. In recent weeks, the Texas senator Ted Cruz has sparred with Mayor Wheeler on Twitter, and called for federal investigation into the city\u2019s handling of protests.</p> <p>Amid<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/04/el-paso-shooting-white-nationalist-supremacy-violence-christchurch\"> rising white nationalism</a>, Cruz <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/antifa-right-wing-violence-ted-cruz-bill-cassidy-resolution_n_5d33c982e4b0419fd32de46b\">has also proposed</a> a <a href=\"https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/KAT19105.pdf\">Senate resolution</a> which would designate antifa as a domestic terrorist group.

      "bodyText": "During the Obama years, Portland was widely seen as a redoubt of crunchy, progressive, west coast liberalism. Much of the world saw the city through the lens of Portlandia, a TV sketch show that lampooned hipsters, cyclists and fussy diners. The city was viewed as a liberal, cultural centre of the US \u2013 and a sharp contrast with more traditional conservative parts of the country. Its laid-back image was frequently satirised, not least by the comedian Fred Armisen, who said: \u201cIt\u2019s where young people go to retire.\u201d Portlandia was more a caricature than a portrait, and locals noted what it left out \u2013 rapid gentrification and displacement, increasing homelessness, the contentious policing of the Portland police bureau (PPB) and the long racist history in the Pacific north-west that made Portland the whitest major city in America. The former NBA player Greg Oden said of his time playing in Portland: \u201cIt isn\u2019t a great city to live in if you\u2019re a young African American male with a lot of money.\u201d Even as Portlandia\u2019s run was ending, a darker picture of the city was being painted, often by outsiders. This weekend will see the latest in a long line of far-right gatherings that have plagued the city over the last few years. Various groups, including the most visible, the Proud Boys, will descend on the downtown area. Once again they will be met by leftist counter-protesters. And once again, PPB will be under heavy scrutiny for the way in which they police the event. But how did Portland, for so long considered a bastion of American liberalism, become the centre of the country\u2019s battle between left and right? Ask Portland\u2019s mayor, Ted Wheeler, what happened to the city\u2019s brewpubs-and-bikes image, and he will say that behind the headlines and images of political street fighting, that city still exists. \u201cI would say Portland has not changed. The impression that people get these days is that everywhere you go in Portland violence is breaking out all over the place. That couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.\u201d Since the 2016 election, the national spotlight has frequently been on Portland during bouts of political violence: a double murder linked to white supremacy in 2017, riots downtown pitting far-right groups against anti-fascists, and instances of heavy-handed policing which have left city residents bloodied and traumatized. Portland, like most west coast cities, is deeply Democratic in its politics, and it has long been home to more radical left currents. And the Portlandia image has some basis in truth \u2013 the city has developed a diverse service economy notable for its craft breweries, cafes, restaurants and artisanal goods. But the Oregon hinterland is deeply conservative, and Portland itself has long been a target for far-right organising. In the 1980s and 1990s, neo-Nazi skinheads converged in the streets, and a gang killed an Ethiopian immigrant, Mulugeta Seraw, in 1988. A number of far-right groups have placed themselves at the center of more recent events. One, Patriot Prayer, is led by Joey Gibson, who lives across the Columbia river in Vancouver, Washington. Gibson has organized about 18 rallies in Portland since 2017, some of which have degenerated into violence. On Thursday, Gibson became the fifth person arrested in just over a week as a result of a raid in May on Cider Riot, a bar popular with the left. He was charged with rioting, a felony. Last July, Gibson told conspiracy broadcaster Alex Jones: \u201cPortland is one of the worst cities in this country. It\u2019s full of so much darkness. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so motivated to go there.\u201d Every event Gibson has organised in Portland has been met by a counter-protest, and these have generally been far larger than the rightwing crowds. Opposition to the rallies acquired a new impetus in May 2017, after Jeremy Christian allegedly showered passengers on a commuter train with racial abuse, and then allegedly stabbed three men who came to their aid, killing two. Christian, who has been charged with aggravated murder, had attended a \u201cfree speech\u201d rally organized by Gibson the previous month draped in an American flag and making fascist salutes. Local anti-fascist groups, especially Rose City Antifa, have produced photographic evidence that early on Gibson\u2019s rallies were attracting local extremists from white nationalist groups. But it is another group which has become increasingly central to Portland\u2019s rightwing protests: the Proud Boys. The \u201cwestern chauvinist\u201d fraternity, established by the Vice co-founder Gavin McInnes in 2015, has been involved in street violence throughout the US. Trials are ongoing after an incident in New York City last year where 10 members of the group were caught on video beating anti-fascists at the conclusion of a McInnes speech. The group has been particularly active in the Pacific north-west. They first cooperated with Gibson in the events he organized, until a reported split. Men in Proud Boys colours were closely involved in one of the worst incidents of political street violence in Portland\u2019s recent history, in June last year. This weekend, the Proud Boys are front and center again. The main organizer is Joe Biggs, a combat veteran and former Alex Jones employee who prominently displays the Proud Boys logo on his Facebook page. Biggs has been banned from many platforms after issuing threats ahead of the rally. In a Periscope video, he warned anti-fascists, or \u201cantifa\u201d: \u201cEvery time you turn your shoulder or your head, you look over, you\u2019re always gonna feel like myself or someone else is gonna be there looking, because that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d Wheeler, the mayor, laid some of the blame for this far-right resurgence at the feet of Donald Trump. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening on the streets of Portland, or what\u2019s happening on the streets of any other community in this country, is not removed from the national trend that we\u2019re seeing,\u201d Wheeler said. \u201cOne has to acknowledge that our president has given life to that kind of hostility, that kind of hate speech.\u201d But the right seems not to hear it. In recent weeks, the Texas senator Ted Cruz has sparred with Mayor Wheeler on Twitter, and called for federal investigation into the city\u2019s handling of protests. Amid rising white nationalism, Cruz has also proposed a Senate resolution which would designate antifa as a domestic terrorist group. The resolution describes Rose City Antifa as a group that \u201cexplicitly rejects the authority of law enforcement officers in the United States\u201d. Harmeet Dhillon, a former editor of the conservative Dartmouth Review, a sometimes lawyer for fired Google engineer James Damore, and the Republican National Committeewoman for California, is promising to sue the city on behalf of Andy Ngo, a conservative writer who was milkshaked and punched by masked protesters at a protest in the city on 29 June. Ngo\u2019s assault initiated a firestorm of outrage in conservative media on its way to becoming a global story. It even attracted the attention of Trump, who mentioned Ngo by name in a speech to a social media summit packed with rightwing internet personalities. Trump also tweeted support of a terrorist designation for antifa. Zakir Khan, the program manager at the Portland-based progressive not-for-profit the Western States Center, said that the Democratic leadership, including Wheeler, have given rightwing groups an opening. \u201cI think that one of the things that these groups look for is vulnerabilities in leadership,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when these incursions from far-right groups started happening, we didn\u2019t see a city, a county, a state-wide response.\u201d Wheeler, for his part, said it\u2019s not just his or Portland\u2019s problem. \u201cFor me, it is so clear that what\u2019s at stake here goes well beyond the question of public safety in one municipality in the United States,\u201d he said. Like California and Washington, Oregon\u2019s politics are dominated by the larger urban centers in the western half of the state. In rural communities \u2013 many of which have experienced decades of economic decline \u2013 this breeds resentment. This us-versus-them politics \u201callows the possibility that the far right in cities like Portland can begin linking themselves with rural articulations, like the Three Percenters or the Oath Keepers\u201d, says Joe Lowndes, who teaches political science at the University of Oregon. During the period where the city has become a symbol for the right, PPB has not appeared to develop a consistent policy for policing events. At two consecutive waterfront protests in 2017, brawls were allowed to go on throughout the late afternoon, with apparently little intervention from police, and no arrests. This has led to accusations from the left of a bias towards rightwing groups. On the right, the persistent rumor has been that Wheeler has ordered the police to stand down. Media reports, however, have suggested that police sympathies flow mostly in one direction. Emails and texts uncovered in February suggested a warm relationship between Gibson and a PPB lieutenant who commanded the squad that patrols city protests. The Guardian reported on a video which appeared to show PPB officers cutting deals with Gibson on a lieutenant\u2019s instructions. Earlier, a PPB report described far-right protesters as \u201cmuch more mainstream\u201d than their leftwing antagonists. On Wednesday, Mayor Wheeler convened a large coalition of community groups and leaders.

      "bodyText": "Places to stay It\u2019s not too late to book a last-minute bank holiday getaway. Carmarthenshire in Wales is quieter than many of the UK\u2019s hotspots and Brechfa Farm on the River Pid in the Cothi Valley makes a great base. The 22-acre smallholding has geese, chicken and alpacas (which guests can take for a walk) and Brechfa village with pub and play park is close by. The four yurts (each sleeps four) have proper beds and woodburners and the whole site can be hired. There\u2019s currently a 25% discount; three nights from 23 August cost \u00a3356 sleeping up to four). Campsites with onsite activities are a winner for families. Yurtcamp, in Liverton (near Newton Abbot), south Devon, has 22 yurts and activities including zipwires, an assault course and a wooded fort (from \u00a3507 for three nights in a large yurt for up to six, from 23 August). At Camp Katur, an off-grid campsite near Bedale, North Yorkshire, there\u2019s quadbiking, a treetop adventure course and a climbing wall, plus a well-equipped communal kitchen and accommodation from teepees to geodomes. Bell tents for four cost from \u00a3150 for three nights from 23 August. In Cornwall, on the Rame Heritage Coast south of Plymouth, brand new Wilder Me has six geodomes in a wildflower conservation area, with sweeping sea views. Profits are used to run nature retreats for adults with autism. A three-night stay for two over bank holiday costs \u00a3255. Many cottage companies have last-minute discounts, too. Rural Retreats\u2019 offers include the chocolate-box Corner Thatch cottage in Abbots Morton, Worcestershire, which sleeps four and now costs \u00a3518.50 for three nights from 23 August (reduced by nearly \u00a3100). Or take to the water on a narrowboat. Savings over bank holiday include a discount of more than \u00a3400 on a boat for four, based at Gailey on the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal. Three nights on Common Kestrel costs \u00a3666 from 23 August. No experience is needed as instruction is provided. There are also big savings to be had on a Peak District boating trip: \u00a3353 to be precise, starting from Stoke-on-Trent. The 16-metre Princess narrowboat, sleeping six, costs \u00a3826 for three nights. Food and drink The two-day Bury St Edmunds food festival in Suffolk (free, 25-26 August) takes over the town centre, with cooking demonstrations from celebrity chefs such as Nick Nairn, 100 food and drink stalls along the Buttermarket and Cornhill, and a farmers\u2019 market. The festival is particularly family-friendly: there is a beach on Charter Square; a mini-farm with pygmy goats, miniature pigs and pint-sized ponies; fairground rides; and entertainment including Punch &amp; Judy, magicians and face-painting. The Hampton Court Palace food festival in Richmond, London (from \u00a321.30 adult/\u00a310.70 child, 24-26 August), has appearances from Michel Roux Jr and Nadiya Hussain; the Big Feastival (from \u00a367/\u00a340 day ticket, \u00a3157.50/\u00a390 weekend, 23-25 August) is a music and food festival on Alex James\u2019s Cotswolds farm, with Rudimental and Jess Glynne among the live acts; Bolton food and drink festival (23-26 August) has free and ticketed events including the Hairy Bikers and Gregg Wallace; and the Great British Food festival at Stonyhurst College, Lancashire (\u00a38.10/\u00a33.33, 24-26 August) has foraging walks and chef demos. Drinkers may prefer the Swansea Bay beer and cider festival (\u00a33 for Camra members/\u00a35 non-Camra, 22-24 August), with 100 real ales, ciders and perries, many of them from Wales, and the Rutland beer festival in Oakham (free, 22-26 August), with 70 real ales. The heritage Churnet Valley Railway in Staffordshire is holding a Spirits of the Railway event (\u00a312, 23-26 August), with 30 gins, 10 rums, five vodkas and five whiskies to sample on the 11-mile journey. Stations will have entertainment, barbecues and gin slushies. In London, the pop-up Fentiman\u2019s Secret Spritz Garden (free entry) has opened in Farringdon, Wednesdays to Saturdays until 29 August, serving low-alcohol spritzes such as martini with rhubarb tonic, prosecco with rose lemonade or Lillet blanc with Valencian orange tonic. It is also open on bank holiday Sunday (25 August), when there is a herbal cocktail masterclass and live jazz. Street life There are several pride events taking place over the bank holiday weekend. The biggest is Manchester Pride (free and ticketed events, 23-26 August), which includes a music festival headlined by Ariana Grande; Superbia, a programme of film, art and talks; a Gay Village street party; a new Youth Pride event; a candlelit vigil; and, of course, the Pride Parade, this year commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots.

The Notting Hill Carnival (free, 25-26 August) in west London is one of the biggest street festivals in the world, celebrating black British culture with music, dancing, parades and street food. But it is not the only bank holiday carnival \u2013 Leeds West Indian Carnival also has a costumed parade (free, 26 August). In Lincoln, the streets will be filled with people in a different kind of fancy dress, attending the world\u2019s biggest Steampunk festival (free and ticketed, 23-26 August). For families with younger children, A Beastly Adventure (free, 25 August) at Smithfields Market in central London stands out. It has been curated by the Museum of London themed around the city\u2019s animals; apparently, visitors will learn to dance like a bee. Outdoors and active Spend an adventure-filled weekend in the Scottish mountains outside Fort William, canyoning, trekking, tackling a via ferrata and camping under the stars. Much Better Adventures has lots of options over the bank holiday, including a two-night trip to the Highlands, with a guided ascent of Ben Nevis, too. Three days, with all technical and camping equipment and most meals, costs \u00a3354. Venture Sail has a discounted Hebrides sailing and wildlife watching trip on board expedition yacht Zuza, departing from Oban for three nights, for \u00a3441 (reduced from \u00a3490) visiting remote islands (no experience necessary).

Accommodation is in bunk-bedded family rooms. Lap the Lough (\u00a339 for the full ride, 23-25 August) is an annual cycle ride around Lough Neagh, starting at Moy in County Tyrone. For those who don\u2019t fancy cycling the full 89 miles, this year there are two new events: a 25-mile round trip to a pop-up cinema in Armagh, and a six-mile family picnic ride. Gardens The Belfast Mela (\u00a37/\u00a36, 25 August) takes place in the city\u2019s Botanic Gardens, which will be transformed into a global garden celebrating culture and diversity. There will be drummers from Ghana, a brass band from Rajasthan and a choir from Russia, plus a north African souk and a world food market.

As the sun sets at Horsham Park in West Sussex, the secret illuminated gardens of Enchanted Horsham (\u00a320 adult/\u00a35 child, 23-25 August) will reveal dragons, unicorns and mermaids. There are fire shows, lifesize puppets and roving performers, plus a silent disco and a show based around folk tales. The Grove Hotel in Hertfordshire has a pop-up Everyman cinema in its walled garden, showing everything from crowd-pleasers, such as The Greatest Showman, to the Jordan Peele horror film Us (from \u00a345/\u00a322, including dinner and film). Nature Camp Wilderness runs three- and five-day summer camps in six UK locations, teaching children how to survive in the wild. Over the bank holiday, there is a camp at Castle Howard (from \u00a3175, 26-28 August), a stately home surrounded by woodland and lakes in North Yorkshire. Children will build and sleep in shelters, light campfires and make wood-fired pizzas on them, learn wilderness first aid, swim in the lakes and try archery. The camp is suitable for ages six to 15. If a residential wilderness trip sounds a little too gnarly, the same company is running bushcraft days at Penhurst Place in Kent, teaching skills such as whittling, knot-tying and campfire cooking (\u00a312 adult/\u00a36.50 child, 25-26 August). Lots of country shows take place over the bank holiday weekend. One of the best is the Malham Show (\u00a310 adult/child free, 24 August) in the Yorkshire Dales, which has displays from the Cumbrian Axemen Team and traditional crafts and produce in addition to sheep, cattle, horses and dogs. There are events to enter too, from mountain-bike orienteering and fell races to an egg-throwing contest.

As well as all the farmyard animals and playgrounds, there\u2019ll be extra craft workshops, a noisy music zone and live performers. If the weather lends itself to a long walk, there will be three guided wildlife rambles on the Isle of Rum, a national nature reserve in the Inner Hebrides. A ranger will lead walkers to spots where there\u2019s a good chance to see deer, seals, birds and wildflowers (\u00a35/\u00a32.50, 24-26 August). Art and music The Exeter Street Arts festival (free and ticketed events, 24 August) fills the city with music, theatre, art and dance.

The Curious Arts festival and the Byline festival, running concurrently in Pippingford Park in the Ashdown Forest, East Sussex (from \u00a3115 for a weekend ticket to both festivals, 23-26 August), have a literary bent \u2013 Byline also claims to be \u201cthe only festival trying to change the world\u201d with an environmental theme. The Hub festival in Cardiff\u2019s Womanby Street (\u00a326 adult/\u00a314 youth, 23-25 August) is a multi-genre weekender with 150 live music acts on 13 stages, comedy, spoken word and poetry.

Foo Fighters, the 1975 and Post Malone headline, with Bastille on the second stage (from \u00a369.50 day/\u00a3205 weekend, 22-25 August). Those who have left their teenage years behind might prefer New Order at the Victorious festival in Portsmouth (from \u00a345 day/\u00a3125 weekend, 23-25 August) or East 17 and 10CC at the Sunshine festival in Upton-upon-Severn, Worcestershire (from \u00a380 weekend, day tickets sold out, 23-25 August). For a different vibe, try the Cottingham folk festival (\u00a386.83 weekend or gigs individually priced) in East Yorkshire, with a lineup including Newton Faulkner, Frank Turner and the Magic Numbers, or the Great British Rhythm and Blues festival in Colne, Lancashire (\u00a345 day/\u00a399 weekend, 23-25 August). Beaches The Hope Cove Weekend (free, 23-26 August) is a fun family event on this beach in south Devon, with land and sea races, sandcastle competitions, live music and folk dancing, a hog roast and fireworks on the Saturday night. August bank holiday in Brighton means one thing \u2013 The Brighton Mod Weekender (daytime events are free, evening events at Komedia from \u00a312), with four days of vintage fairs, afternoon DJ sessions and club nights from 22 August. On the Sunday there\u2019s also a celebration of 40 years since Quadrophenia the Movie, with Q&amp;As with the cast, live music and a screening of the film. For old-fashioned seaside fun, Cromer on Norfolk\u2019s north coast hosts the World Crabbing Competition on 25 August, with competitors battling to catch the most or biggest crabs from the pier, and stalls selling local food, drink and crafts. But you don\u2019t need to go to the sea to enjoy the beach this bank holiday. The Bristol Beach Club has transformed Millennium Square with sand, cabanas and beach huts (until 7 September). Activities include sunrise yoga and petanque, and there are vegan pizzas, acai bowls and cocktails on tap. Visitors can watch films on the Big Screen Bristol from deckchairs and there are DJs at weekends. Other urban beaches can be found on Old Market Square in Nottingham and Victoria Gardens in Leeds (both until 1 September). Looking for a holiday with a difference?

      "body": "<p>Foo Fighters HQ is a warehouse in LA\u2019s San Fernando Valley that acts as a temple to Dave Grohl. Every corridor is plastered with discs awarded to the bands he has put his stamp on: Foos, Nirvana, Queens of the Stone Age, Tenacious D, not to mention various other projects. There are awards from countries all over the world (and custom surfboards from Australia). The hangar in the back is home to fan-made flags and paraphernalia. Pinball machines are never far from reach; the wifi network is called \u201cSuck It\u201d; there is even a painted portrait of Grohl in a smoking jacket. The sofas are decorated with pillows that Grohl\u2019s mum made out of old band T-shirts. \u201cMy mom asked me one day: \u2018What are you gonna do with all your T-shirts in the attic? Can I make pillows outta them?\u2019\u201d he says, holding a Led Zeppelin one. \u201cI thought: \u2018Mom this is your second career.\u2019 Could you fucking imagine?\u201d</p> <p>Grohl, now 50, spent his youth in Virginia before flying by the seat of his pants all over the US in the name of rock\u2019n\u2019roll. He lived in Washington DC and LA with hardcore band Scream. He spent time in Olympia, Washington and Seattle after joining Nirvana. His Foos duties saw him settle in LA. Today, in his studio\u2019s control room, he sits opposite the sound desk that Nirvana\u2019s landscape-changing Nevermind (1991) was made on. \u201cThis thing will outlive us all,\u201d he says. It\u2019s signed by Stevie Nicks, Joan Jett, even Paul McCartney. Tacked to its left corner is a picture taken of Grohl\u2019s drumkit. \u201cOh look!\u201d he says, picking it up. \u201cHere\u2019s the only picture I have of recording Nevermind. Isn\u2019t that funny? That\u2019s all I got.\u201d He\u2019s joking, of course. It gave him everything \u2026</p> <h2><strong>Nirvana </strong>Molly\u2019s Lips (BBC session) (1990)</h2> <p>Nirvana first came on Grohl\u2019s radar when he drummed in Scream. \u201cI was staying with a friend in Amsterdam,\u201d he recalls. \u201cWhenever Scream toured Europe we\u2019d stay in his apartment, buy hash, and get high listening to records.\u201d Nirvana\u2019s 1989 debut Bleach was in this collection and Grohl was immediately struck by the aesthetic. \u201cI loved the dissonance and the chaos, and then there was this beautiful song About a Girl right in the middle that could have been off a 60s Beatles record.\u201d At the time he was dating a girl who was a fan. \u201cIt may have been one of the first times I knew a girl who liked a band I liked.\u201d</p> <p>Scream disbanded in LA in 1990, and Grohl had no money to get home.

Grohl had seen Kurt Cobain and Krist Novoselic backstage at a Melvins show. \u201cNovoselic is 6ft 8in and Kurt was quiet in a corner. I said to Buzz: \u2018Who\u2019s that?\u2019 He said: \u2018That\u2019s Nirvana.\u2019 I laughed. As with everything Nirvana, it didn\u2019t make sense.\u201d He auditioned in Seattle for Nirvana\u2019s UK tour. Thirty minutes in, it was a done deal.

Kurt was unwell. Then he was well. Then he was unwell. The last year of the band was tough.\u201d Nobody had anticipated just how much touring Nirvana would do for Nevermind. \u201cBy the time we got to Europe I remember it being cold. It was the first time I felt depression. There was one day where I couldn\u2019t get out of bed. I started to question why we were even there.\u201d</p> <p>Cobain wanted to find a studio when they got home. Novoselic and Grohl set up and recorded for a few days. Cobain came on the last day to put vocals on (lyric: \u201cI will move away from here, you won\u2019t be afraid of fear\u201d). His suicide came soon after, on 5 April, 1994. Years later, talk of releasing a greatest hits brought it out of the archives. \u201cYou look back on it and you read it through a different lens,\u201d says Grohl. \u201cLyrically, it\u2019s heartbreaking. He was in a place we may not have recognised. Musically, there\u2019s something cathartic.\u201d He starts to buckle. \u201cYou know, I miss his voice. I miss him \u2026</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he was comfortable in the place that he was at the time,\u201d he adds. \u201cI don\u2019t know if anybody was. But his experience was much different. I used to think it sounded like he was singing the chorus. Now I listen to it and it\u2019s like he\u2019s wailing.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Late! </strong>Friend of a Friend (1990)</h2> <p>Grohl always wrote songs for himself on a multitrack, playing every instrument himself. This was written when he was living on Cobain\u2019s sofa. It is about his new bandmates \u2013 a pretty bleak impression. \u201cMy experience of music was: van touring, sleeping on the stage of a club in a sleeping bag, having some squatters cook you pasta, then going to the next town.\u201d When he arrived in Olympia, he felt like \u201can alien\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI remember this friend of Kurt\u2019s \u2013 a guy called Slim Moon \u2013 looked at me and said: \u2018You\u2019re a rocker \u2026\u2019 I was like: \u2018Is that bad?!\u2019 I felt really alone,\u201d he says. \u201cI was stuck in this room that had cigarette butts all over the floor and this turtle tank. Every night as I tried to fall asleep on a couch half my size, this fucking turtle would just bang its head on the glass. Kurt liked turtles. I don\u2019t even think it had a fucking name.\u201d When Cobain went to bed, Grohl would record. \u201cThere was no TV. We had four records: Divine, Mark Lanegan, Devo and a Bobcat Goldthwait comedy LP. I was sick of those, so I recorded some songs whispering, barely playing guitar. I didn\u2019t wanna wake Kurt.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Foo Fighters </strong>Alone + Easy Target (1995)</h2> <p>After Cobain\u2019s suicide, Grohl received invites to join the likes of Pearl Jam but refused offers. In October he made the Foos\u2019 self-titled debut instead, recording all the instruments himself as an exercise in grief. \u201cI never imagined I would be the singer of a band,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter Nirvana ended, I didn\u2019t wanna play music. I sure as fuck didn\u2019t wanna go be someone\u2019s drummer. I knew that it would remind me of Nirvana. I\u2019m very proud. Nirvana changed my life for ever but there were times when I wanted to escape it. Just picking up an instrument or turning on a radio made me so sad. Then I realised that doing the thing I\u2019d always done \u2013 go to a basement, record by myself \u2013 might restart my heart.\u201d</p> <p>This song was written in Grohl\u2019s basement in 1992 after the Nevermind tour ended. On a trip to New York to play Saturday Night Live, Grohl went to Cobain\u2019s hotel room to share it with him. \u201cHe was having a bubble bath,\u201d recalls Grohl. He pressed play and left Cobain to soak in it. \u201cI went back in and he kissed me! That might have been the only time I ever felt validated by the band.\u201d Some resented Grohl\u2019s decision to keep playing. \u201cI didn\u2019t imagine I was gonna pick up where Nirvana left off. I didn\u2019t imagine myself to be Freddie Mercury,\u201d he says. \u201cI made 100 cassettes and handed them to friends. I called it Foo Fighters because I didn\u2019t want people to think I was trying to be Tom Petty.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Foo Fighters </strong>Everlong (1997)</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBG7P-K-r1Y\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eBG7P-K-r1Y?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>After the self-titled debut album garnered interest and took Foo Fighters around the world, Grohl committed to the idea of being frontman and hired Gil Norton to produce follow-up LP The Colour and the Shape \u2013 their biggest seller. Everlong, its standout, was written in Virginia during Christmas 1996 as Grohl\u2019s first marriage to photographer Jennifer Youngblood ended. He had fallen for Louise Post from the band Veruca Salt.</p> <p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t become a band leader yet,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was still this experiment. I had no idea what I was doing. I almost made that second record to prove the first one wasn\u2019t a one-off.\u201d The process was fuelled by drama: drummer William Goldsmith went awol, guitarist Pat Smear quit and Grohl was mid-divorce. \u201cIt was a fucking mess,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in the idea that conflict breeds creative results, but oh man! That was a difficult time that made for some really good songs. Again I was on someone\u2019s fucking couch in a sleeping bag. I was basically homeless but I was free.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jun/06/kirk-weddle-best-photograph-nirvana-nevermind-swimming-baby\">Kirk Weddle's best photograph: Nirvana's Nevermind swimming baby</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Queens of the Stone Age </strong>No One Knows (2002)</h2> <p>A reputation follows Grohl that he is the guy to call when you\u2019re in a bind. Josh Homme, frontman of Queens of the Stone Age (QOTSA), has used this card. \u201cThat\u2019s because I don\u2019t charge him money to play drums,\u201d jokes Grohl. Grohl and Homme met in Nirvana\u2019s heyday. Homme was in desert psych band Kyuss. QOTSA and Foos have toured the world together. In the late 90s, a magazine asked Grohl what his biggest regret of the year was. \u201cI said: \u2018That Queens of the Stone Age didn\u2019t ask me to be their drummer.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>During the making of third QOTSA album Songs for the Deaf, their drummer Gene Trautmann quit. Homme asked Grohl to finish the record. \u201cI said: \u2018Absofuckinglutely\u2019. It\u2019s not the last time he called me to rescue him.\u201d During the recording of QOTSA\u2019s 2013 album \u2026Like Clockwork, Grohl got a text from Homme. \u201cI was reading stories to my daughter. So what\u2019s up?\u201d Again, their drummer had quit. \u201cI\u2019m like: \u2018All right, when do you want me?\u2019\u201d He has since formed a supergroup, Them Crooked Vultures, with Homme and Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones. They put out an album in 2009.</p> <p>\u201cJosh is one of my best friends,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re like brothers. We go out and have waffles together. We ride motorcycles. There is nobody I\u2019d rather play drums with. He\u2019s the guy.\u201d He cannot keep his cool around Jones, though. \u201cThere are times when you\u2019ve relaxed into a sofa and you\u2019re not thinking about his time in Led Zeppelin. Then you start playing and you\u2019re immediately reminded that you are a musical speck compared to this man. It\u2019s still hard to accept that I got to play in a band with that guy. Technically we\u2019re <em>still</em> a band.\u201d Does that mean something\u2019s on the horizon? He teases: \u201cWe practise once every decade, and we\u2019re coming up on another decade aren\u2019t we? I don\u2019t have any official news but there\u2019s always something cooking.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Foo Fighters </strong>Best of You (2005)</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_L4Rixya64\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/h_L4Rixya64?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>In 2004, Grohl went on the presidential trail with the Democrats\u2019 John Kerry. When he returned to write Foos\u2019 fifth LP, In Your Honor, he was inspired by resistance. He was convinced that Kerry would win. \u201cDidn\u2019t happen. C\u2019est la vie, mon cherie.\u201d Grohl\u2019s mother was a liberal public school teacher, his father a Republican speech writer. \u201cI know what it\u2019s like to be in the middle. Difficult, but there is a middle.\u201d When he is playing to 50,000 people, he knows it\u2019s a mixed bag out there, but he hopes that music can unite. Booze helps, too. \u201cOne of the things that\u2019s wrong with Washington, DC is that no one drinks any more,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have a president who\u2019s never had a drink. That terrifies me more than his Twitter. The guy needs a drink, big time. Today.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Dave Grohl </strong>Play (2018)</h2> <p>Last year Grohl recorded a 23-minute long jam, setting himself the challenge of playing every instrument. His daughters were the inspiration. He has three. His eldest, Violet, is already on the musical path. \u201cShe can pick up an instrument and learn how to play it in a week,\u201d he beams. Violet rehearses in kids\u2019 covers bands. \u201cI would watch them learn Don\u2019t Stop Believing by Journey, going home and practising. It\u2019s a challenge. When that spark ignites you cannot think of anything else. From 13-year-old kids learning a Journey song to a 50-year-old man trying to record a fucking 23-minute long instrumental in one take, it\u2019s the same feeling.\u201d</p> <p>Grohl advocates for being resourceful when it comes to learning how to play because the public school system in the US is so lacking in financial support for music. \u201cYou have to be imaginative and do things on your own,\u201d he says. \u201cMaking music is everybody\u2019s right. Fucking pick up a harmonica and blow the shit out of it. See what happens.\u201d For this track, Grohl played piano. It wasn\u2019t easy. What instrument is he going to attempt next? \u201cI\u2019ll try anything, baby,\u201d he smirks. \u201cI\u2019ll fake it till I make it!\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>Foo Fighters headline Leeds festival on 23 Aug and Reading festival on 25 Aug.</strong></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3ejfpssOVK7aHmzxnOZ5vx\">  <iframe height=\"380\" width=\"300\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/3ejfpssOVK7aHmzxnOZ5vx\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>",

      "bodyText": "Foo Fighters HQ is a warehouse in LA\u2019s San Fernando Valley that acts as a temple to Dave Grohl. Every corridor is plastered with discs awarded to the bands he has put his stamp on: Foos, Nirvana, Queens of the Stone Age, Tenacious D, not to mention various other projects. There are awards from countries all over the world (and custom surfboards from Australia). The hangar in the back is home to fan-made flags and paraphernalia. Pinball machines are never far from reach; the wifi network is called \u201cSuck It\u201d; there is even a painted portrait of Grohl in a smoking jacket. The sofas are decorated with pillows that Grohl\u2019s mum made out of old band T-shirts. \u201cMy mom asked me one day: \u2018What are you gonna do with all your T-shirts in the attic? Can I make pillows outta them?\u2019\u201d he says, holding a Led Zeppelin one. \u201cI thought: \u2018Mom this is your second career.\u2019 Could you fucking imagine?\u201d Grohl, now 50, spent his youth in Virginia before flying by the seat of his pants all over the US in the name of rock\u2019n\u2019roll. He lived in Washington DC and LA with hardcore band Scream. He spent time in Olympia, Washington and Seattle after joining Nirvana. His Foos duties saw him settle in LA. Today, in his studio\u2019s control room, he sits opposite the sound desk that Nirvana\u2019s landscape-changing Nevermind (1991) was made on. \u201cThis thing will outlive us all,\u201d he says. It\u2019s signed by Stevie Nicks, Joan Jett, even Paul McCartney. Tacked to its left corner is a picture taken of Grohl\u2019s drumkit. \u201cOh look!\u201d he says, picking it up. \u201cHere\u2019s the only picture I have of recording Nevermind. Isn\u2019t that funny? That\u2019s all I got.\u201d He\u2019s joking, of course. It gave him everything \u2026 Nirvana Molly\u2019s Lips (BBC session) (1990) Nirvana first came on Grohl\u2019s radar when he drummed in Scream. \u201cI was staying with a friend in Amsterdam,\u201d he recalls. \u201cWhenever Scream toured Europe we\u2019d stay in his apartment, buy hash, and get high listening to records.\u201d Nirvana\u2019s 1989 debut Bleach was in this collection and Grohl was immediately struck by the aesthetic. \u201cI loved the dissonance and the chaos, and then there was this beautiful song About a Girl right in the middle that could have been off a 60s Beatles record.\u201d At the time he was dating a girl who was a fan. \u201cIt may have been one of the first times I knew a girl who liked a band I liked.\u201d Scream disbanded in LA in 1990, and Grohl had no money to get home. He was 20 and doing tile work at a coffee shop. A friend \u2013 Buzz Osborne from the Melvins \u2013 told him that Nirvana were looking for a drummer. Grohl had seen Kurt Cobain and Krist Novoselic backstage at a Melvins show. \u201cNovoselic is 6ft 8in and Kurt was quiet in a corner. I said to Buzz: \u2018Who\u2019s that?\u2019 He said: \u2018That\u2019s Nirvana.\u2019 I laughed. As with everything Nirvana, it didn\u2019t make sense.\u201d He auditioned in Seattle for Nirvana\u2019s UK tour. Thirty minutes in, it was a done deal. Molly\u2019s Lips was his first Nirvana recording, made in a session for John Peel\u2019s BBC Radio 1 show in London. Peel wasn\u2019t at the session, but it was momentous regardless. \u201cThe engineer was Dale [Griffin], the drummer of Mott the Hoople!\u201d he says. \u201cThat blew my mind.\u201d Grohl was accustomed to recording in basements and playing in pubs to a dozen people. \u201cNirvana were playing to 600 people a night. I felt like I was in the biggest band in the world already. I was jet-lagged, drinking too much tea, we were staying at this bed-and-breakfast in Shepherd\u2019s Bush: the Dalmacia. It was the first time I had fried toast.\u201d Nirvana Smells Like Teen Spirit, (1991) \u201cNothing changed my life like Smells Like Teen Spirit,\u201d says Grohl. It is the song that defined Gen X, yet radio stations refused to play it back in the day. \u201cLet me tell you something,\u201d says Grohl. \u201cThe day Foo Fighters learned how to play Never Gonna Give You Up by Rick Astley I realised that the arrangement is exactly the same!

They never really discussed composition. \u201cWe spoke to each other in the rehearsal room at volume 10 as we were playing. I knew when the verse was coming because I could see Kurt\u2019s foot getting close to turning off the distortion pedal. We would watch each other\u2019s body language and the song built into this crescendo, then exploded.\u201d It was never intended as Nevermind\u2019s statement song. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was the anthem,\u201d says Grohl, who preferred Lithium and In Bloom. He attributes its success to its lack of pretence. \u201cIt would be as moving if it were Kurt and a guitar. We were very protective about our music. We wouldn\u2019t pick up instruments and start singing for no reason. We wouldn\u2019t go play shows that meant nothing to us. Every time we played it was blood and guts. To hear that song on the radio is one thing but to stand in front of us as we did it in the room? Fuckin\u2019 A. It was more than sound. You could actually feel it. Wow.\u201d For Grohl, the song didn\u2019t feel radical. He grew up on noise-rock and death metal. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t an intentional battle cry. It was a piece of the puzzle.\u201d MTV wouldn\u2019t show the video during the day. \u201cWhat teenager didn\u2019t want to start a riot in the fucking high-school gymnasium? We all did. At that point, we just kept our heads down and played shows. Our expectations were not lofty. Fuck no. All I wanted was my own apartment so I didn\u2019t have to sleep on Kurt\u2019s couch any more.\u201d Nirvana You Know You\u2019re Right (1994) This is the last song that Nirvana recorded with Cobain. \u201cI listened to it for the first time in 10 years,\u201d Grohl sighs. \u201cOh God, it\u2019s hard to listen to.\u201d It was written during soundchecks on tour. \u201cIt was not a pleasant time for the band.

Novoselic and Grohl set up and recorded for a few days. Cobain came on the last day to put vocals on (lyric: \u201cI will move away from here, you won\u2019t be afraid of fear\u201d). His suicide came soon after, on 5 April, 1994. Years later, talk of releasing a greatest hits brought it out of the archives. \u201cYou look back on it and you read it through a different lens,\u201d says Grohl. \u201cLyrically, it\u2019s heartbreaking. He was in a place we may not have recognised. Musically, there\u2019s something cathartic.\u201d He starts to buckle. \u201cYou know, I miss his voice. I miss him \u2026 \u201cI don\u2019t think he was comfortable in the place that he was at the time,\u201d he adds. \u201cI don\u2019t know if anybody was. But his experience was much different. I used to think it sounded like he was singing the chorus. Now I listen to it and it\u2019s like he\u2019s wailing.\u201d Late! Friend of a Friend (1990) Grohl always wrote songs for himself on a multitrack, playing every instrument himself. This was written when he was living on Cobain\u2019s sofa. It is about his new bandmates \u2013 a pretty bleak impression. \u201cMy experience of music was: van touring, sleeping on the stage of a club in a sleeping bag, having some squatters cook you pasta, then going to the next town.\u201d When he arrived in Olympia, he felt like \u201can alien\u201d. \u201cI remember this friend of Kurt\u2019s \u2013 a guy called Slim Moon \u2013 looked at me and said: \u2018You\u2019re a rocker \u2026\u2019 I was like: \u2018Is that bad?!\u2019 I felt really alone,\u201d he says. \u201cI was stuck in this room that had cigarette butts all over the floor and this turtle tank. Every night as I tried to fall asleep on a couch half my size, this fucking turtle would just bang its head on the glass. Kurt liked turtles. I don\u2019t even think it had a fucking name.\u201d When Cobain went to bed, Grohl would record. \u201cThere was no TV. We had four records: Divine, Mark Lanegan, Devo and a Bobcat Goldthwait comedy LP. I was sick of those, so I recorded some songs whispering, barely playing guitar. I didn\u2019t wanna wake Kurt.\u201d Foo Fighters Alone + Easy Target (1995) After Cobain\u2019s suicide, Grohl received invites to join the likes of Pearl Jam but refused offers. In October he made the Foos\u2019 self-titled debut instead, recording all the instruments himself as an exercise in grief. \u201cI never imagined I would be the singer of a band,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter Nirvana ended, I didn\u2019t wanna play music. I sure as fuck didn\u2019t wanna go be someone\u2019s drummer. I knew that it would remind me of Nirvana. I\u2019m very proud. Nirvana changed my life for ever but there were times when I wanted to escape it. Just picking up an instrument or turning on a radio made me so sad. Then I realised that doing the thing I\u2019d always done \u2013 go to a basement, record by myself \u2013 might restart my heart.\u201d This song was written in Grohl\u2019s basement in 1992 after the Nevermind tour ended. On a trip to New York to play Saturday Night Live, Grohl went to Cobain\u2019s hotel room to share it with him. \u201cHe was having a bubble bath,\u201d recalls Grohl. He pressed play and left Cobain to soak in it. \u201cI went back in and he kissed me! That might have been the only time I ever felt validated by the band.\u201d Some resented Grohl\u2019s decision to keep playing. \u201cI didn\u2019t imagine I was gonna pick up where Nirvana left off. I didn\u2019t imagine myself to be Freddie Mercury,\u201d he says. \u201cI made 100 cassettes and handed them to friends. I called it Foo Fighters because I didn\u2019t want people to think I was trying to be Tom Petty.\u201d Foo Fighters Everlong (1997) After the self-titled debut album garnered interest and took Foo Fighters around the world, Grohl committed to the idea of being frontman and hired Gil Norton to produce follow-up LP The Colour and the Shape \u2013 their biggest seller. Everlong, its standout, was written in Virginia during Christmas 1996 as Grohl\u2019s first marriage to photographer Jennifer Youngblood ended. He had fallen for Louise Post from the band Veruca Salt. \u201cI hadn\u2019t become a band leader yet,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was still this experiment. I had no idea what I was doing. I almost made that second record to prove the first one wasn\u2019t a one-off.\u201d The process was fuelled by drama: drummer William Goldsmith went awol, guitarist Pat Smear quit and Grohl was mid-divorce. \u201cIt was a fucking mess,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in the idea that conflict breeds creative results, but oh man! That was a difficult time that made for some really good songs. Again I was on someone\u2019s fucking couch in a sleeping bag. I was basically homeless but I was free.\u201d Queens of the Stone Age No One Knows (2002) A reputation follows Grohl that he is the guy to call when you\u2019re in a bind. Josh Homme, frontman of Queens of the Stone Age (QOTSA), has used this card. \u201cThat\u2019s because I don\u2019t charge him money to play drums,\u201d jokes Grohl. Grohl and Homme met in Nirvana\u2019s heyday. Homme was in desert psych band Kyuss. QOTSA and Foos have toured the world together. In the late 90s, a magazine asked Grohl what his biggest regret of the year was. \u201cI said: \u2018That Queens of the Stone Age didn\u2019t ask me to be their drummer.\u2019\u201d During the making of third QOTSA album Songs for the Deaf, their drummer Gene Trautmann quit. Homme asked Grohl to finish the record. \u201cI said: \u2018Absofuckinglutely\u2019. It\u2019s not the last time he called me to rescue him.\u201d During the recording of QOTSA\u2019s 2013 album \u2026Like Clockwork, Grohl got a text from Homme. \u201cI was reading stories to my daughter. So what\u2019s up?\u201d Again, their drummer had quit. \u201cI\u2019m like: \u2018All right, when do you want me?\u2019\u201d He has since formed a supergroup, Them Crooked Vultures, with Homme and Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones. They put out an album in 2009. \u201cJosh is one of my best friends,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re like brothers. We go out and have waffles together. We ride motorcycles. There is nobody I\u2019d rather play drums with. He\u2019s the guy.\u201d He cannot keep his cool around Jones, though. \u201cThere are times when you\u2019ve relaxed into a sofa and you\u2019re not thinking about his time in Led Zeppelin. Then you start playing and you\u2019re immediately reminded that you are a musical speck compared to this man. It\u2019s still hard to accept that I got to play in a band with that guy. Technically we\u2019re still a band.\u201d Does that mean something\u2019s on the horizon? He teases: \u201cWe practise once every decade, and we\u2019re coming up on another decade aren\u2019t we? I don\u2019t have any official news but there\u2019s always something cooking.\u201d Foo Fighters Best of You (2005) In 2004, Grohl went on the presidential trail with the Democrats\u2019 John Kerry. When he returned to write Foos\u2019 fifth LP, In Your Honor, he was inspired by resistance. He was convinced that Kerry would win. \u201cDidn\u2019t happen. C\u2019est la vie, mon cherie.\u201d Grohl\u2019s mother was a liberal public school teacher, his father a Republican speech writer. \u201cI know what it\u2019s like to be in the middle. Difficult, but there is a middle.\u201d When he is playing to 50,000 people, he knows it\u2019s a mixed bag out there, but he hopes that music can unite. Booze helps, too. \u201cOne of the things that\u2019s wrong with Washington, DC is that no one drinks any more,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have a president who\u2019s never had a drink. That terrifies me more than his Twitter. The guy needs a drink, big time. Today.\u201d Dave Grohl Play (2018) Last year Grohl recorded a 23-minute long jam, setting himself the challenge of playing every instrument. His daughters were the inspiration. He has three. His eldest, Violet, is already on the musical path. \u201cShe can pick up an instrument and learn how to play it in a week,\u201d he beams. Violet rehearses in kids\u2019 covers bands. \u201cI would watch them learn Don\u2019t Stop Believing by Journey, going home and practising. It\u2019s a challenge. When that spark ignites you cannot think of anything else. From 13-year-old kids learning a Journey song to a 50-year-old man trying to record a fucking 23-minute long instrumental in one take, it\u2019s the same feeling.\u201d Grohl advocates for being resourceful when it comes to learning how to play because the public school system in the US is so lacking in financial support for music. \u201cYou have to be imaginative and do things on your own,\u201d he says. \u201cMaking music is everybody\u2019s right. Fucking pick up a harmonica and blow the shit out of it. See what happens.\u201d For this track, Grohl played piano. It wasn\u2019t easy. What instrument is he going to attempt next? \u201cI\u2019ll try anything, baby,\u201d he smirks. \u201cI\u2019ll fake it till I make it!\u201d Foo Fighters headline Leeds festival on 23 Aug and Reading festival on 25 Aug.",

I like having really honest conversations with friends about how fucked everything is, but being able to laugh about it as well.\u201d</p> <p>Right. You gotta laugh, eh?

And perhaps because it reminds me of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/esther-rantzen\" title=\"\">Esther Rantzen</a>.\u201d</p> <p>No such fluff sullies the lexicon of Burke\u2019s latest character. Anthony is an ex-public school symbolist opera buff who takes dates to the <a href=\"https://www.wallacecollection.org/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwhdTqBRDNARIsABsOl9-G3CURymL_MgoFAjnRCt05hMvj_dKCpfk9sVvo3w16Hle3vE1G0EQaAhFPEALw_wcB\" title=\"\">Wallace Collection</a> and works (probably) for the Foreign Office. He is considered, verbose, dapper, charming, mysterious, vain, pretentious, aphoristic, arrogant, refined and absolutely catastrophic.</p> <p>He is also closely based on the ex-boyfriend of the film\u2019s writer-director. In fact, the whole of The Souvenir precisely reconstructs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/15/the-souvenir-joanna-hogg-humanises-middle-class-problems\" title=\"\">Joanna Hogg</a>\u2019s years as a film student in London in the early 80s, when she had an affair that shook her life. Her three previous films \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/sep/19/drama1\" title=\"\">Unrelated</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/mar/03/archipelago-review\" title=\"\">Archipelago</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/apr/24/exhibition-review-joanna-hogg\" title=\"\">Exhibition</a> \u2013 are highly specific autobiographical excoriations of the liberal-leaning lower-upper-classes. But this time, it\u2019s <em>really</em> personal.</p> <p>Hogg\u2019s goddaughter, Honor Swinton Byrne, plays Julie (AKA Joanna). Swinton Byrne\u2019s mother, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/15/tilda-swinton-a-bigger-splash-interview\" title=\"\">Tilda Swinton</a>, a friend of Hogg\u2019s since school, plays her mother. Burke was cast on sight. \u201cHe\u2019s physically got something of the young Orson Welles,\u201d Hogg tells me. \u201cHe\u2019s very different from all those young actors who are preoccupied with going to the gym. I find all that very boring. Tom is like a matinee idol, a star of the forgotten age. That really excited me and chimed with my memory of this person.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTw1WGy0WyA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WTw1WGy0WyA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>But Burke needed more than just hot chops. Hogg\u2019s shooting style \u2013 no script, just structure \u2013 required him to improvise at length. \u201cI was casting a person, not an actor,\u201d says Hogg. \u201cAnd his mind also worked outside the box. So I had this sense that Tom could inhabit this enigmatic and unusual man.\u201d</p> <p>She showed him photos and letters (some of which Burke reads aloud in the film) and played a recording of the real man\u2019s voice. He went to Lyme Regis to brush up his calligraphy with the artist <a href=\"https://dunfordwood.com/\" title=\"\">Hugh Dunford Wood</a>, who designed the silk bow ties the real Anthony wore, and which Burke sports in the movie. Burke\u2019s reading list included Burroughs, Cocteau and Crowley. It shows. Anthony\u2019s pronouncements are florid and polished \u2013 and all Burke\u2019s words.</p> <p>In the flesh, Burke, 38, speaks slowly and smilingly, with faintly Izzardian inflection. \u201cThis was a man with a swarming brain,\u201d he says, \u201cwho was constantly thinking about everything. He was armoured with a vocabulary and a use of language. A lot of the things he says to Julie he probably said two nights before at a party. So I wanted to have a kind of palette in my head.\u201d</p> <p>The immersion was symbiotic. Parasitic Anthony was hard to shake. \u201cThere was this kind of ghost of him just having an opinion on everything between takes because he\u2019s a very verbose, opinionated man.\u201d</p> <p>Burke\u2019s work in The Souvenir is extraordinary. It\u2019s Julie\u2019s story, but Anthony you can\u2019t keep your eyes off. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/martinscorsese\" title=\"\">Martin Scorsese</a>, the executive producer, emails the Guardian to call him \u201cimmediately compelling \u2013 every word and every gesture.

He definitely recognised the person.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"90946e16414ccfdc3d576208cd7306e0ca2e4ce6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90946e16414ccfdc3d576208cd7306e0ca2e4ce6/86_0_4798_2880/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tilda Swinton, Joanna Hogg, Honor Swinton Byrne and Tom Burke\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tilda Swinton, Joanna Hogg, Honor Swinton Byrne and Tom Burke promoting The Souvenir at the Berlinale film festival earlier this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John MacDougall/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even if you didn\u2019t know him, the brilliance and intimacy of his exhumation (his letters, his bow ties, his bed) is quite something. There is a deep weirdness, even a queasiness. A ghost has been summoned. Burke says he hadn\u2019t really thought about it until recently. In retrospect, it haunts him more. He recalls sudden ill-tempers, explicable only as Anthony resurfacing. And, on the last week of shooting, \u201cI felt very strange and heavy and just a bit dead inside.\u201d</p> <p>This indelible performance is Burke\u2019s first film lead. He was Ryan Gosling\u2019s rotter brother in the first five minutes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/aug/01/only-god-forgives-review\" title=\"\">Only God Forgives</a> and Felicity Jones\u2019s benevolent fella in the last part of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/06/the-invisible-woman-review\" title=\"\">The Invisible Woman</a>. But he has mostly stuck to theatre and TV and become big in both, just like his parents. His father is David Burke (Watson to Jeremy Brett\u2019s Holmes), his mother Anna Calder-Marshall (Cathy to Timothy Dalton\u2019s Heathcliff). They were introduced by Brian Cox. Burke\u2019s godfather, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/14/alan-rickman-giant-of-british-film-and-theatre-dies-at-69\" title=\"\">Alan Rickman</a>, helped fund his time at Rada.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"918d611f133cc8114b2471e15707f77373d00bc3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/918d611f133cc8114b2471e15707f77373d00bc3/545_191_2098_2098/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Burke as private eye Cormoran Strike with Holliday Grainger as Robin Ellacott in Strike\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Burke as private eye Cormoran Strike with Holliday Grainger as Robin Ellacott in the BBC series Strike.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steffan Hill/BBC/Bronte Film &amp; TV Ltd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There, tutors identified a strain of melancholy in the man which had first been pointed out by teachers at school.

      "bodyText": "If you are asking Tom Burke to a party, for God\u2019s sake don\u2019t tell him it\u2019ll be fun. \u201cHate the word! Ugh! The idea that there\u2019s any sort of expectation. I like having really honest conversations with friends about how fucked everything is, but being able to laugh about it as well.\u201d Right. You gotta laugh, eh? A grin that\u2019s 35% grimace. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t. I\u2019ve always hated that phrase. Everything has to arrive in its own time.\u201d He lacquers almond butter on top of strawberry jam on gluten-free toast. \u201cThe only one I like is \u2018That\u2019s life!\u2019 It\u2019s quite vague. And perhaps because it reminds me of Esther Rantzen.\u201d No such fluff sullies the lexicon of Burke\u2019s latest character. Anthony is an ex-public school symbolist opera buff who takes dates to the Wallace Collection and works (probably) for the Foreign Office. He is considered, verbose, dapper, charming, mysterious, vain, pretentious, aphoristic, arrogant, refined and absolutely catastrophic. He is also closely based on the ex-boyfriend of the film\u2019s writer-director. In fact, the whole of The Souvenir precisely reconstructs Joanna Hogg\u2019s years as a film student in London in the early 80s, when she had an affair that shook her life. Her three previous films \u2013 Unrelated, Archipelago and Exhibition \u2013 are highly specific autobiographical excoriations of the liberal-leaning lower-upper-classes. But this time, it\u2019s really personal. Hogg\u2019s goddaughter, Honor Swinton Byrne, plays Julie (AKA Joanna). Swinton Byrne\u2019s mother, Tilda Swinton, a friend of Hogg\u2019s since school, plays her mother. Burke was cast on sight. \u201cHe\u2019s physically got something of the young Orson Welles,\u201d Hogg tells me. \u201cHe\u2019s very different from all those young actors who are preoccupied with going to the gym. I find all that very boring. Tom is like a matinee idol, a star of the forgotten age. That really excited me and chimed with my memory of this person.\u201d But Burke needed more than just hot chops. Hogg\u2019s shooting style \u2013 no script, just structure \u2013 required him to improvise at length. \u201cI was casting a person, not an actor,\u201d says Hogg. \u201cAnd his mind also worked outside the box. So I had this sense that Tom could inhabit this enigmatic and unusual man.\u201d She showed him photos and letters (some of which Burke reads aloud in the film) and played a recording of the real man\u2019s voice. He went to Lyme Regis to brush up his calligraphy with the artist Hugh Dunford Wood, who designed the silk bow ties the real Anthony wore, and which Burke sports in the movie. Burke\u2019s reading list included Burroughs, Cocteau and Crowley. It shows. Anthony\u2019s pronouncements are florid and polished \u2013 and all Burke\u2019s words. In the flesh, Burke, 38, speaks slowly and smilingly, with faintly Izzardian inflection. \u201cThis was a man with a swarming brain,\u201d he says, \u201cwho was constantly thinking about everything. He was armoured with a vocabulary and a use of language. A lot of the things he says to Julie he probably said two nights before at a party. So I wanted to have a kind of palette in my head.\u201d The immersion was symbiotic. Parasitic Anthony was hard to shake. \u201cThere was this kind of ghost of him just having an opinion on everything between takes because he\u2019s a very verbose, opinionated man.\u201d Burke\u2019s work in The Souvenir is extraordinary. It\u2019s Julie\u2019s story, but Anthony you can\u2019t keep your eyes off. Martin Scorsese, the executive producer, emails the Guardian to call him \u201cimmediately compelling \u2013 every word and every gesture. I\u2019m reminded of James Fox in The Servant \u2013 his performance has that kind of distilled power.\u201d For Hogg, he was almost too good. \u201cI found it quite strange, because Tom managed to go beyond what I had imagined possible, in an uncanny way.\u201d The only other person who has seen the film and who knew the real-life man was, she says, too upset after the screening to speak. \u201cHe found it quite a confrontation. He definitely recognised the person.\u201d Even if you didn\u2019t know him, the brilliance and intimacy of his exhumation (his letters, his bow ties, his bed) is quite something. There is a deep weirdness, even a queasiness. A ghost has been summoned. Burke says he hadn\u2019t really thought about it until recently. In retrospect, it haunts him more. He recalls sudden ill-tempers, explicable only as Anthony resurfacing. And, on the last week of shooting, \u201cI felt very strange and heavy and just a bit dead inside.\u201d This indelible performance is Burke\u2019s first film lead. He was Ryan Gosling\u2019s rotter brother in the first five minutes of Only God Forgives and Felicity Jones\u2019s benevolent fella in the last part of The Invisible Woman. But he has mostly stuck to theatre and TV and become big in both, just like his parents. His father is David Burke (Watson to Jeremy Brett\u2019s Holmes), his mother Anna Calder-Marshall (Cathy to Timothy Dalton\u2019s Heathcliff). They were introduced by Brian Cox. Burke\u2019s godfather, Alan Rickman, helped fund his time at Rada. There, tutors identified a strain of melancholy in the man which had first been pointed out by teachers at school. He groans when I mention it, but also likes it; considers it less a propensity to grumpy-boots than the condition of being \u201cless hot, less in fashion \u2026 what Susan Sontag described as Buster Keaton not Charlie Chaplin\u201d. And it\u2019s true that Burke\u2019s mainstream fame is due to a series of BBC shows that have a loyal audience without international buzz: Musketeers, War &amp; Peace and, since, 2017, Strike, the TV version of JK Rowling\u2019s crime novels written under the pen-name Robert Galbraith. An already lusty fanbase \u2013 there is especial appreciation of Athos\u2019s way with a horse \u2013 mushroomed as viewers were introduced to Burke\u2019s dishevelled one-legged detective. He lives in London with a girlfriend he doesn\u2019t speak about, confessing a \u201csoft spot\u201d for Boris Johnson when the prime minister stressed after his row with Carrie Symonds that his private life was his business. \u201cI feel like this glass confessional box culture we\u2019ve suddenly found ourselves in is so insidious.\u201d Details do emerge: he sometimes has milk in his tea and sometimes not, the inconsistency of which freaked out a former girlfriend. (\u201cShe was like: who are you?\u201d) He did some stone carving when younger and more recently got into pots, making six small souffl\u00e9 bowls that are \u201cquite good for ice-cream\u201d. But while it\u2019s the Sunday-night primetime stuff that means some fans will lap up such nuggets, Burke has kept his stage work energetically challenging. Last year he co-founded Ara, a theatre company with the Israeli director Gadi Roll promising \u201cemotional complexity and stylised staging \u2026 that asserts itself as different in kind from the naturalism of television\u201d; their inaugural production was a touring version of Schiller\u2019s Don Carlos. When we have breakfast, he is just finishing a West End run in Ibsen\u2019s tragedy Rosmersholm. The play is a \u201chowl in the dark\u201d he says, proudly \u2013 and its revival is testimony to the time we live in. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in denial about the darkness within each one of us. Not afforded ourselves the time and space to peer into that. It\u2019s only lately we\u2019ve been able to go: \u2018Yeah, you know what, we are really confused.\u2019\u201d In Thatcher\u2019s time, he says, \u201ctheatre had to be entertainment\u201d. Under Blair, \u201cutilitarian, educational, with a deafeningly singular message\u201d. Rosmersholm and The Souvenir do not conform, even now. And when it comes to assessing the virtues of contemporary culture, Burke is very #TeamAnthony: intolerant of filler, hungry for inner machinations. \u201cI think there\u2019s a dark and twisted idea of democracy that everybody is as interesting as everybody else,\u201d he says. \u201cSo we mustn\u2019t make anybody too interesting. There\u2019s an ironing out of edges and eccentricities, idiosyncrasies in people and situations. \u201cYet everybody\u2019s experience is really interesting.\u201d He corrects himself. \u201cOr, if not their experience, then their unlived life. Or their desire. Their id. Their curiosity. I just don\u2019t want to just see a version of a version of a version. Sometimes people hide behind a kind of naturalistic milieu. But life is full of the most sharp, abrupt changes of tone, from the tragic to the absurd.\u201d That, he says, eyes alight, is why he so loves the Ibsen. \u201cI feel like an expressionist nihilist deep in my heart. And I think nihilism can stop the wheel from going around, around, around, around, around \u2013 saying the same thing, reacting the same way. It can make everyone shut up for five minutes to try and have an original thought. I\u2019m not saying we should be silent, do nothing. But maybe just for a day? To see what comes of it?\u201d Sure. Why not, eh? It\u2019ll be fun! Burke drinks his coffee darkly. \u2022 The Souvenir is released in the UK on 31 August",

It captured a series of concerts in New York\u2019s Battery Park and Madison Square Garden shortly after the accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear reactor. A murderer\u2019s row of late 70s soft rockers like Jackson Browne, The Doobie Brothers, Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, Bonnie Raitt and James Taylor performed, but Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band brought the energy. The film, which played in midnight showings for years, came out just a few months before the release of Springsteen\u2019s double album The River. He was establishing himself as an artist you just <em>had </em>to see live, and, in a pre-MTV era, the energetic No Nukes clips were substantial corroborating evidence.</p> <p>Four years later Springsteen went from respected rocker to mainstream superstardom. Born In The USA, apart from being misinterpreted by Ronald Reagan, hit the zeitgeist in all the right ways, especially on film.</p> <p>At a time when music videos were far from respectable, Springsteen collaborated with some of the era\u2019s great auteurs. First was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=129kuDCQtHs\">Dancing In The Dark</a>, a peppy pop tune in which the Boss is snapping his fingers on stage in tight denim and rolled-up cuffs. He locks eyes with a young Courtney Cox (\u201cHeyyyy baby!\u201d) and helps her onto the stage. Go rewatch it, it\u2019s adorable. The energetic short was directed by Brian De Palma, the only music video on his resume.</p> <p>Soon thereafter came the title track, Born in the USA, directed by John Sayles. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPhWR4d3FJQ\">There\u2019s </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPhWR4d3FJQ\">Springsteen again</a> on stage (sleeveless denim jacket, headband, shaggier hair) but weaved in and out with images of blue collar America: factories, flags, used cars, the prom. It\u2019s a melancholy mix of patriotism and pathos, paired well with the story of a Vietnam vet unable to find his footing upon returning from war.</p> <p>Sayles, fresh from The Brother From Another Planet and with the coal miner drama Matewan in his sights, came back to direct Glory Days, the nostalgia-soaked hit in which Springsteen is a daydreaming machinist reminiscing of his baseball triumphs. If an alien came down from Neptune and asked \u201cWho is the Bruce Springsteen?\u201d these <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vQpW9XRiyM\">six earth minutes</a> would be the most succinct way to get the point across. Sayles rounded out his Springsteen trilogy with I\u2019m On Fire, in which we were reminded that Springsteen wasn\u2019t just a good time rockin\u2019 buddy at the bar, he also had <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpXArn3hII\">smoldering, leading man looks</a>.</p> <p>Around this same time Springsteen joined his E Street associate Little Steven (Steven Van Zandt) in his Artists Against Apartheid initiative. The protest song Sun City isn\u2019t remembered quite as fondly as Glory Days, but it did bring together an extraordinary, diverse group of musicians. Miles Davis, Joey Ramone, Lou Reed and The Fat Boys don\u2019t get together every day. The video was directed by Jonathan Demme, which kicked off a relationship that lasted until the end of the film-maker\u2019s life.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4z2DtNW79sQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4z2DtNW79sQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Most notably, Demme asked Springsteen to write a song for Philadelphia while the movie was still being shot. For an artist like Springsteen, who had and, unfortunately, still has a subsection of fans prone to machismo, one can not overstate the importance of a first person song about Aids in 1994. Streets of Philadelphia won Bruce Springsteen an Oscar, and Demme <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4z2DtNW79sQ\">shot the accompanying music video</a> in which a perambulating Springsteen does not lip-synch.</p> <p>A great many of Springsteen tunes have made their way into movies over the years. A common misconception is that Secret Garden was written for Cameron Crowe\u2019s Jerry Maguire, but it was actually a then new track bundled on a Greatest Hits collection that Crowe cherry picked for the Tom Cruise film.</p> <p>Other than that, there hasn\u2019t really been an <em>iconic </em>use of a Springsteen tune in a movie or on television. Unless Hungry Heart in The Wedding Singer counts? If I had to pick a favorite, though, it\u2019d either be <a href=\"https://youtu.be/wXTuJyPRKS0\">Adam Raised A Cain</a> in the series finale of Sons of Anarchy (as Jax zooms off to find his destiny) or Meryl Streep tearing the roof off the wedding reception hall with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SbqjzCpeGw\">My Love Will Not Let You Down</a> at the end of Jonathan Demme\u2019s Ricki and the Flash. (This is a particularly fun one, as the song is a deep cut that went unreleased for over a decade.) Chronologically, this is the final non-documentary scene in Demme\u2019s filmography.</p> <p>The lack of a quintessential use of a classic might mean Springsteen\u2019s songs are too big to be repurposed. (Sorry, Blinded By The Light, but Born To Run and Thunder Road will outlive you.) But that doesn\u2019t mean his songs can\u2019t <em>inspire </em>a film. Award ten trivia points to anyone who remembers Sean Penn\u2019s directorial debut <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEU3RsJdWGY\">The Indian Runner</a>, a 1991 drama starring Viggo Mortensen and David Morse as brothers on opposite sides of the law. It was, in fact, based on Springsteen\u2019s 1982 tune <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jRRixWzhiM\">Highway Patrolman</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZE7OchG3DY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DZE7OchG3DY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>So with all of these Hollywood connections, why has Springsteen never acted in a movie? I guess he\u2019s just not interested, beyond a few cameos. He popped up on an episode of the show Lillyhammer as an undertaker, but that was because his pal Little Steven was the star, and even directed that episode. His most memorable role, if you can call it that, was when he played himself, or at least a fantasy version, in Stephen Frears\u2019 version of Nick Hornby\u2019s High Fidelity.</p> <p>\u201cI want more,\u201d the lovesick John Cusack says to his imaginary rocker friend. He\u2019s talking about encounters with his ex-girlfriends, but it works as a plea from all Springsteen fans. \u201cIf that\u2019s what you\u2019re lookin\u2019 for,\u201d the Boss mumbles as he noodles on his electric guitar. Hopefully for us, there\u2019s still plenty coming.</p>",

It\u2019s one thing to present an autobiography in story and song in a successful one-man Broadway show. Eight shows a week are practically punching a factory clock! But technicolor big screen picture show treatment just doesn\u2019t jibe with the persona. It\u2019s part of why Gurinder Chadha\u2019s Blinded by the Light, the adaptation of Sarfraz Manzoor\u2019s memoir Greetings From Bury Park, is better than a Springsteen biopic. What could be more like a Springsteen song itself than the struggles of a kid caught between worlds, finding his voice and direction through rock n\u2019 roll? Most critics (though not all!) have found Blinded By The Light to be agreeable fun, and it may just end up a sleeper hit. While we wait for that inevitable biopic, this is far from Springsteen\u2019s first dalliance with movies. One does not become an internationally recognized icon from radio play alone. Though extremely hard to find today unless you have a VHS player, Springsteen was the big winner in the documentary film No Nukes, released in 1980. It captured a series of concerts in New York\u2019s Battery Park and Madison Square Garden shortly after the accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear reactor. A murderer\u2019s row of late 70s soft rockers like Jackson Browne, The Doobie Brothers, Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, Bonnie Raitt and James Taylor performed, but Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band brought the energy. The film, which played in midnight showings for years, came out just a few months before the release of Springsteen\u2019s double album The River. He was establishing himself as an artist you just had to see live, and, in a pre-MTV era, the energetic No Nukes clips were substantial corroborating evidence. Four years later Springsteen went from respected rocker to mainstream superstardom. Born In The USA, apart from being misinterpreted by Ronald Reagan, hit the zeitgeist in all the right ways, especially on film. At a time when music videos were far from respectable, Springsteen collaborated with some of the era\u2019s great auteurs. First was Dancing In The Dark, a peppy pop tune in which the Boss is snapping his fingers on stage in tight denim and rolled-up cuffs. He locks eyes with a young Courtney Cox (\u201cHeyyyy baby!\u201d) and helps her onto the stage. Go rewatch it, it\u2019s adorable. The energetic short was directed by Brian De Palma, the only music video on his resume. Soon thereafter came the title track, Born in the USA, directed by John Sayles. There\u2019s Springsteen again on stage (sleeveless denim jacket, headband, shaggier hair) but weaved in and out with images of blue collar America: factories, flags, used cars, the prom. It\u2019s a melancholy mix of patriotism and pathos, paired well with the story of a Vietnam vet unable to find his footing upon returning from war. Sayles, fresh from The Brother From Another Planet and with the coal miner drama Matewan in his sights, came back to direct Glory Days, the nostalgia-soaked hit in which Springsteen is a daydreaming machinist reminiscing of his baseball triumphs. If an alien came down from Neptune and asked \u201cWho is the Bruce Springsteen?\u201d these six earth minutes would be the most succinct way to get the point across. Sayles rounded out his Springsteen trilogy with I\u2019m On Fire, in which we were reminded that Springsteen wasn\u2019t just a good time rockin\u2019 buddy at the bar, he also had smoldering, leading man looks. Around this same time Springsteen joined his E Street associate Little Steven (Steven Van Zandt) in his Artists Against Apartheid initiative. The protest song Sun City isn\u2019t remembered quite as fondly as Glory Days, but it did bring together an extraordinary, diverse group of musicians. Miles Davis, Joey Ramone, Lou Reed and The Fat Boys don\u2019t get together every day. The video was directed by Jonathan Demme, which kicked off a relationship that lasted until the end of the film-maker\u2019s life. Most notably, Demme asked Springsteen to write a song for Philadelphia while the movie was still being shot. For an artist like Springsteen, who had and, unfortunately, still has a subsection of fans prone to machismo, one can not overstate the importance of a first person song about Aids in 1994. Streets of Philadelphia won Bruce Springsteen an Oscar, and Demme shot the accompanying music video in which a perambulating Springsteen does not lip-synch. A great many of Springsteen tunes have made their way into movies over the years. A common misconception is that Secret Garden was written for Cameron Crowe\u2019s Jerry Maguire, but it was actually a then new track bundled on a Greatest Hits collection that Crowe cherry picked for the Tom Cruise film. Other than that, there hasn\u2019t really been an iconic use of a Springsteen tune in a movie or on television. Unless Hungry Heart in The Wedding Singer counts? If I had to pick a favorite, though, it\u2019d either be Adam Raised A Cain in the series finale of Sons of Anarchy (as Jax zooms off to find his destiny) or Meryl Streep tearing the roof off the wedding reception hall with My Love Will Not Let You Down at the end of Jonathan Demme\u2019s Ricki and the Flash. (This is a particularly fun one, as the song is a deep cut that went unreleased for over a decade.) Chronologically, this is the final non-documentary scene in Demme\u2019s filmography. The lack of a quintessential use of a classic might mean Springsteen\u2019s songs are too big to be repurposed. (Sorry, Blinded By The Light, but Born To Run and Thunder Road will outlive you.) But that doesn\u2019t mean his songs can\u2019t inspire a film. Award ten trivia points to anyone who remembers Sean Penn\u2019s directorial debut The Indian Runner, a 1991 drama starring Viggo Mortensen and David Morse as brothers on opposite sides of the law. It was, in fact, based on Springsteen\u2019s 1982 tune Highway Patrolman. So with all of these Hollywood connections, why has Springsteen never acted in a movie? I guess he\u2019s just not interested, beyond a few cameos. He popped up on an episode of the show Lillyhammer as an undertaker, but that was because his pal Little Steven was the star, and even directed that episode. His most memorable role, if you can call it that, was when he played himself, or at least a fantasy version, in Stephen Frears\u2019 version of Nick Hornby\u2019s High Fidelity. \u201cI want more,\u201d the lovesick John Cusack says to his imaginary rocker friend. He\u2019s talking about encounters with his ex-girlfriends, but it works as a plea from all Springsteen fans. \u201cIf that\u2019s what you\u2019re lookin\u2019 for,\u201d the Boss mumbles as he noodles on his electric guitar. Hopefully for us, there\u2019s still plenty coming.",

A crowd of 3,000 fell silent as Samuel Bamford, a radical reformer, poet and weaver, climbed on a chair to speak. They were, he bellowed, about to embark on \u201cthe most important meeting that had ever been held for parliamentary reform\u201d.</p> \n<p>There was to be no silly business. No sticks, no weapons, no back-chat. He admired their attire, \u201cnot even one who did not exhibit a white Sunday\u2019s shirt\u201d.

By the time night fell, more than 650 people among a crowd of up to 60,000 in St Peter\u2019s Field would be injured, among them 17 <a href=\"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/local-news/rochdale-council-bids-to-end-middleton-857649\">Moonrakers</a>, as Middleton people have long been known.

Though Bamford did not live to see universal suffrage, which arrived in 1928, his bravery, and that of the other Peterloo protesters, laid the foundations for British democracy.

The top floor now hosts the Lighthouse Project, a social enterprise that provides a safety net for the sort of people the local council used to help before its budget was cut by a quarter in the government\u2019s austerity drive.</p> \n<p>Half an hour before the Lighthouse opens, a queue has begun to form.

Fighting for democracy was thirsty work.</p> \n<p>In 1819, no one in Manchester or Salford had the vote, despite a population of 150,000. In 2019, most people in Harpurhey stay at home on election day by choice: this May, less than 20% of the electorate cast a ballot in a vote that returned Pat Karney, a Labour councillor since 1979, to the town hall.</p> \n<p>Harpurhey is a friendly place of great deprivation: nine out of 10 households contain people who may need high or very high levels of support, according <a href=\"http://www.manchester.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/24336/mosaic_profile.pdf\">to the council</a>. Yet despite this widespread dependency on the state, there is distrust of the politicians who run it.</p> \n<p>At Harpurhey indoor market, William Porter, holds forth from his mobility scooter, proudly sporting an \u201cold enough to know better\u201d badge. \u201cI don\u2019t really vote. I don\u2019t want to vote. I just can\u2019t get my head around them [politicians],\u201d says the 80-year-old former Grenadier Guard. \u201cI don\u2019t like liars, put it that way.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Peterloo protesters were angry that only the richest 10% of men in the country could vote, with a tiny elite getting ever richer while the poorest starved to death. Meanwhile in modern Manchester, an estimated 35% of children grow up in poverty, one of the highest rates of any local authority in England.</p> \n<p>Yet a new generation of young people are determined for their voices to be heard. Anita Okunde, 15, from Middleton, represents Rochdale at the UK youth parliament. She says she would walk all the way into Manchester to campaign for better mental health provision for young people, or to demand action on knife crime.</p> \n<p>One Friday each month her colleague Emma Greenwood, who represents Bury, skips school to take part in the Youth Strike. Up to a thousand young people gather in St Peter\u2019s Square to demand government action on the climate emergency.</p> \n<p>It sucks to not get a say, she says: \u201cFor me that\u2019s heartbreaking, the fact I am going to have to grow up and inherit this world that other people have voted for. I don\u2019t see why my age should dictate my ability to have a say in how my future should map out.

If you say Yes I Can! here at the Radisson Blu Hotel, were [sic] looking for ambitious people just like you!\u201d gushed the job ad. There was a certain irony in that particular hotel chain advertising that sort of job at a time when Manchester is getting ready to mark the sacrifice working-class people made to fight for their rights. Just look at the red plaque outside its sister hotel the Radisson Blu Edwardian (formerly the Free Trade Hall): it is slap bang on the site of what was once St Peter\u2019s Field, where the massacre took place.</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 27 August 2019 to make it clear that the zero hours job advertised was for the Radisson Blu hotel at Manchester airport, not at the Radisson Blu Edwardian as an earlier version said.</p>",

I just can\u2019t get my head around them [politicians],\u201d says the 80-year-old former Grenadier Guard. \u201cI don\u2019t like liars, put it that way.\u201d The Peterloo protesters were angry that only the richest 10% of men in the country could vote, with a tiny elite getting ever richer while the poorest starved to death. Meanwhile in modern Manchester, an estimated 35% of children grow up in poverty, one of the highest rates of any local authority in England. Yet a new generation of young people are determined for their voices to be heard. Anita Okunde, 15, from Middleton, represents Rochdale at the UK youth parliament. She says she would walk all the way into Manchester to campaign for better mental health provision for young people, or to demand action on knife crime. One Friday each month her colleague Emma Greenwood, who represents Bury, skips school to take part in the Youth Strike. Up to a thousand young people gather in St Peter\u2019s Square to demand government action on the climate emergency. It sucks to not get a say, she says: \u201cFor me that\u2019s heartbreaking, the fact I am going to have to grow up and inherit this world that other people have voted for. I don\u2019t see why my age should dictate my ability to have a say in how my future should map out. I probably know more about politics than some 30-year-olds.\u201d The \u2018precariat\u2019 lives on After their pints in Harpurhey, the Middleton marchers went through Collyhurst, now a big council estate soon to be \u201creimagined\u201d by the council with help of the Far East Consortium, a Hong Kong-based development company. They then approached Ancoats \u2013 once a densely populated slum and now one of the most fashionable areas of Manchester, where a two-bedroom loft in a converted factory built in 1825 is currently on sale for \u00a3600,000. In Collyhurst, where significantly more residents are on jobseeker\u2019s allowance than the national average, secure employment is thin on the ground. The same was true in 1819 for Bamford and friends, according to Dr Janette Martin, curator of the Peterloo exhibition at the John Rylands library. \u201cEarly 19th-century handloom weavers and those employed in the cotton spinning mills were victims of periodic trade slumps, when large numbers would be thrown out of work, to be rehired weeks later as and when trade picked up and the manufacturers needed more workers. Remind you of the gig economy and the so-called precariat?\u201d Two hundred years later, an estimated 896,000 people in the UK are now employed on zero-hours contracts \u2013 up from 143,000 in 2008 \u2013 and Manchester\u2019s streets are clogged up not with horses and carts, but Uber cabs and bicycles and motorbikes ridden by self-employed couriers working for Deliveroo and its rivals. A few weeks before the 200th anniversary of the Peterloo massacre, the Radisson Blu hotel at Manchester airport advertised for a \u201cmonitoring and evaluation assistant\u201d on zero hours. \u201cHave you got an eye for detail, do you want to add the finishing touch to something big? If you say Yes I Can! here at the Radisson Blu Hotel, were [sic] looking for ambitious people just like you!\u201d gushed the job ad. There was a certain irony in that particular hotel chain advertising that sort of job at a time when Manchester is getting ready to mark the sacrifice working-class people made to fight for their rights. Just look at the red plaque outside its sister hotel the Radisson Blu Edwardian (formerly the Free Trade Hall): it is slap bang on the site of what was once St Peter\u2019s Field, where the massacre took place. \u2022 This article was amended on 27 August 2019 to make it clear that the zero hours job advertised was for the Radisson Blu hotel at Manchester airport, not at the Radisson Blu Edwardian as an earlier version said.",

Other parasites called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinostoma\">Echinostoma worms</a> are only 1cm long when fully grown, but heavy infestations inflame the intestines, causing abdominal pain, diarrhoea, weight loss and tiredness.</p> <p>The remains of the settlement were first uncovered in 1999 during digs at a brick clay quarry at Must Farm, which is on the outskirts of Peterborough. Since then, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jul/14/uks-best-bronze-age-site-must-farm-dig-ends-analyis-continue-years\">excavations</a> have revealed the full extent of the site. Built on stilts over a tributary of the River Nene, the settlement had five wooden huts with wicker floors and clay chimneys. The huts were connected by timber causeways and protected on the land side by a long wooden palisade.</p> <p>The site dates to 900BC and was not a long lived community. Through accident or attack the settlement was engulfed in flames, perhaps only months after it was built, leaving the homes and their contents to plunge into the water. Today, these homes are the most completely preserved prehistoric domestic structures in Britain.</p> <p>Among the burnt timbers of what has been described as a fenland Pompeii, archaeologists have found glass and amber beads imported from the continent, delicately woven linen, weapons, kitchen tools, pottery and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/feb/19/archaeologists-excavate-bronze-age-wheel-cambridgeshire\">largest bronze age wheel</a> ever found in the UK.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3795b63d12111428024ec93df3ceca393c02e88c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3795b63d12111428024ec93df3ceca393c02e88c/149_0_1468_881/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Probable construction of the Must Farm stilt houses.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Probable construction of the Must Farm stilt houses.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: V Herring/SWNS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And then there are the coprolites. Writing in the journal Parasitology, the researchers explain how they hand-fished 15 prehistoric poos from the waterlogged mud. Chemical analyses found that four belonged to people and seven to dogs, with the remainder of uncertain origin. Peering at pieces under the microscope, the researchers confirmed a variety of parasites from the eggs, which measure only a fraction of a millimetre long.

      "bodyText": "The clutch of homes that stood on stilts in the wetland fens of East Anglia were the envy of the local peasantry 3,000 years ago. But amid the remains of the grand wooden huts and the belongings of the well-to-do residents lurked evidence that all was not well at Must Farm, Britain\u2019s premier bronze age settlement. Firm, sausage-shaped lumps found skulking in the mud that swallowed the settlement after a catastrophic fire have been identified as pieces of faeces. Inside these deposits researchers found a grim array of tiny eggs \u2013 the calling card for parasitic worm infestations. In the sanitising jargon of archaeology, the human coprolites were found to be brimming with eggs from fish tapeworms, giant kidney worms, whipworms and other undesirable creatures, pointing to a downside of the settlers\u2019 fresh and convenient marsh diet. \u201cThey must have been eating raw or undercooked fish, frogs or shellfish,\u201d said Piers Mitchell, the director of the ancient parasites laboratory at Cambridge University, who studied the precious deposits. \u201cSome might not have had symptoms but others would have known about it.\u201d Once fish tapeworms have set up home in the gut they can grow to a length of 10 metres, coiling around the twists and turns of the intestines. The most infested inhabitants in the Must Farm community probably would have been anaemic as the worms absorbed food intended for their hosts. Kidney worms are more reasonable in size but properly fed will still reach a metre and destroy the organ in the process. Other parasites called Echinostoma worms are only 1cm long when fully grown, but heavy infestations inflame the intestines, causing abdominal pain, diarrhoea, weight loss and tiredness. The remains of the settlement were first uncovered in 1999 during digs at a brick clay quarry at Must Farm, which is on the outskirts of Peterborough. Since then, excavations have revealed the full extent of the site. Built on stilts over a tributary of the River Nene, the settlement had five wooden huts with wicker floors and clay chimneys. The huts were connected by timber causeways and protected on the land side by a long wooden palisade. The site dates to 900BC and was not a long lived community. Through accident or attack the settlement was engulfed in flames, perhaps only months after it was built, leaving the homes and their contents to plunge into the water. Today, these homes are the most completely preserved prehistoric domestic structures in Britain. Among the burnt timbers of what has been described as a fenland Pompeii, archaeologists have found glass and amber beads imported from the continent, delicately woven linen, weapons, kitchen tools, pottery and the largest bronze age wheel ever found in the UK. And then there are the coprolites. Writing in the journal Parasitology, the researchers explain how they hand-fished 15 prehistoric poos from the waterlogged mud. Chemical analyses found that four belonged to people and seven to dogs, with the remainder of uncertain origin. Peering at pieces under the microscope, the researchers confirmed a variety of parasites from the eggs, which measure only a fraction of a millimetre long. Some pieces had more than 10,000 eggs per gram. Whipworm eggs found in the faeces could have come from slaughtered pigs, but many of the other parasites are spread by people eating raw fish, amphibians and molluscs, the researchers said. \u201cThis is really interesting for us. It\u2019s one of the very few chances we\u2019ve had to look for evidence of parasitic infection in the bronze age,\u201d said Marissa Ledger, a biological anthropologist on the Cambridge team. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that a lot of these eggs were passing through the system, but a lot of people would have been infected. In a single coprolite we\u2019re finding eggs from multiple different species.\u201d The haul includes the earliest evidence of fish tapeworms, Echinostoma worms, Capillaria worms and giant kidney worms in Britain. By living over the water, the Must Farm residents were somewhat protected from common parasites such as roundworms, which are spread by direct faecal contamination of food. But the location left them vulnerable to other infections. Thick reed beds and stagnant water beneath the huts made sure that excrement dumped in the marsh did not travel far; instead it provided fertile ground in which the parasites could thrive and infect the local wildlife. That wildlife, eaten raw or undercooked, acted as the disease vector spreading the worms to the human residents and their pets. The Must Farm work should help scientists understand the conditions that can drive human infections. \u201cA lot of the parasites we found still affect people today, not necessarily in Britain but in other parts of the world,\u201d Ledger said. \u201cIf we can understand the environments that help them flourish, we can use that to combat these diseases.\u201d",

Their peaceful protest turned bloody when Manchester magistrates ordered Yeoman \u2013 a private militia paid for by rich locals \u2013 to storm the crowd with sabres.</p>\n    <p>Most historians agree that 14 people were definitely killed in the massacre \u2013 15 if you include the unborn child of Elizabeth Gaunt, killed in the womb after she was beaten by constables in custody. A further three named people are believed to have either been stabbed or trampled to death.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why is it called Peterloo?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The name was first coined five days after the massacre by James Wroe, editor of the Manchester Observer, the city\u2019s first radical newspaper (no relation to the Observer of today). According to historian Robert Poole, Peterloo was \u201ca bitter pun, comparing the cowardly attacks by the Yeomanry and soldiers on unarmed civilians to the brutality suffered at Waterloo.\u201d</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What did the protesters want?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>They wanted political reform. The years leading up to Peterloo had been tough for working class people and they wanted a voice in parliament to put their needs and wants on the political agenda, inspired by the French Revolution across the Channel. Machines had begun to take jobs in the lucrative cotton industry but periodic trade slumps closed factories at short notice, putting workers out on the street. The Napoleonic Wars, which ended in 1815 with the Battle of Waterloo, had taken a heavy toll on the nation\u2019s finances, and 350,000 ex-servicemen returned home needing jobs and food. Yet those in power seemed more interested in lining their own pockets than helping the poor.</p>\n    <p>At that point, only the richest landowners could vote, and large swathes of the country were not represented in Westminster. Manchester and Salford, which then had a population of 150,000, had no MP, yet Oxford and Cambridge Universities had their own representation. At the time the extension of the vote to all men, let alone women, was actively opposed by many who thought the vote should be restricted to those of influence and means.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why is Peterloo important?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>It paved the way for parliamentary democracy and particularly the Great Reform Act of 1832 which created new parliamentary seats, particularly in the industrial towns of the north of England. It also led to the establishment two years later of the Manchester Guardian by John Edward Taylor, a 28-year-old English journalist who was present at the massacre and saw how the \u201cestablishment\u201d media sought to discredit the protesters.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/helenpidd\"><b>Helen Pidd</b></a>, <i>North of England editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got this tiny plaque on the hotel and it\u2019s so high up you\u2019d have to be about 8ft to see it.

Bernadette\u2019s is a gripping tale. She was an ill-educated peasant girl who, despite enormous pressure to recant, stubbornly stuck to her story of the visions of the beautiful lady who had urged her to dig for a spring \u2013 the lady was the Virgin Mary, and the spring became the healing waters of the grotto of Lourdes. It still attracts pilgrims: this week, in which the feast of the assumption of Mary is celebrated, will see a surge in numbers. But there aren\u2019t enough year-round visitors any more. And as their numbers have declined, so have the fortunes of hotels, restaurants and souvenir shops. Even the main basilica has suffered: donations have been falling for nearly a decade.</p> <p>This might be due to a decline in Christianity, or to Lourdes becoming as much a shrine to tat as to the Virgin Mary.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a subject for a PhD thesis: religion interpreted through the genre of the musical. There\u2019s already a fair bit to study: The Sound of Music, Godspell, Jesus Christ Superstar, Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. If you want some fun, add in Sister Act. Now there\u2019s a new musical that would require a chapter of its own in that doctoral thesis about religious visions. And if Bernadette de Lourdes takes off, it won\u2019t just be filling theatre seats but could draw more visitors, restoring the economic fortunes of the French pilgrimage centre. Created by the producer Roberto Ciurleo, whose previous work was about Robin Hood, it has just opened in Lourdes and tells the story of the town\u2019s most famous daughter: Bernadette Soubirous, who in 1858 saw a series of 18 apparitions of the Virgin Mary. When religious musicals work, they explore the magnetism of the lead character and conflicts to be faced. Bernadette\u2019s is a gripping tale. She was an ill-educated peasant girl who, despite enormous pressure to recant, stubbornly stuck to her story of the visions of the beautiful lady who had urged her to dig for a spring \u2013 the lady was the Virgin Mary, and the spring became the healing waters of the grotto of Lourdes. It still attracts pilgrims: this week, in which the feast of the assumption of Mary is celebrated, will see a surge in numbers. But there aren\u2019t enough year-round visitors any more. And as their numbers have declined, so have the fortunes of hotels, restaurants and souvenir shops. Even the main basilica has suffered: donations have been falling for nearly a decade. This might be due to a decline in Christianity, or to Lourdes becoming as much a shrine to tat as to the Virgin Mary. It\u2019s certainly put me off. All those souvenir shops selling tourist kitsch, from plastic Virgin Marys filled with water from the grotto, to plaster statues, rosary beads and prayer cards.

      "bodyText": "Federal law enforcement officials have all the tools necessary to address far-right violence proactively \u2013 as my own successful investigations as an FBI undercover agent in the 1990s indicate. They have simply chosen as a matter of policy not to prioritize these cases. What role racism, latent or overt, plays in these decisions has yet to be explored. There are currently 52 federal terrorism laws available to address entirely domestic acts of political violence. Congress has also passed five federal hate crimes statutes specifically designed to punish the types of violence white supremacists and other far-right militants often commit against vulnerable communities. Organized crime and conspiracy statutes can also be used to dismantle white supremacist gangs. When white nationalists commit deadly attacks like the El Paso shooting, these crimes fit the statutory definition of domestic terrorism. Terrorism remains the FBI\u2019s top priority. It ranks hate crimes fifth and organized crime sixth, however. So, when FBI agents or federal prosecutors initially label far-right violence as hate crimes, or gang crimes, they de-prioritize these cases, limiting the available resources and narrowing the scope of the investigations. Worse, as a matter of policy, the justice department defers the vast majority of hate crimes to state and local police and prosecutors, who are often ill-equipped or uninterested in pursuing these cases. Justice department crime victim surveys estimate there are approximately 230,000 violent hate crimes annually, yet federal prosecutors charge only about 25 hate crimes defendants each year. State and local law enforcement, however, are not picking up the slack. Only about 12% of state and local law enforcement agencies report hate crimes occurring in their jurisdictions, and in some states, reported hate crimes are rarely prosecuted as such. These deficiencies in the law enforcement response to hate crimes are not new. And a justice department-funded study in 2000 examining the barriers to hate crime reporting identified fear of the police as the primary reason victims refuse to report. This is unsurprising: the communities targeted by white supremacist violence are often disproportionately targeted by police violence and abuse as well. It is easy to paint white supremacy as an extreme ideology relegated to the fringes of our society. The violence these fringe actors inflict on our society tears at the social fabric, but it represents just a tiny fraction of the 17,000 annual homicides in the US. It is a manageable problem when law enforcement and our government leaders focus on reducing it. Historically, they have chosen not to. The legacy of our government\u2019s official sanction of white supremacy continues to linger, particularly infecting our criminal justice system and immigration policies. The FBI remains an overwhelmingly white, male organization, which may partly explain why it would treat white supremacist violence as a less serious concern than an imaginary Black Identity Extremist movement. Recent reports documenting law enforcement cooperation with violent far-right groups and antipathy toward their victims at riotous demonstrations in Sacramento, California, and in Portland, Oregon, demand investigation to see what role bias plays in the police response. Though the justice department and FBI officials have claimed renewed interest in tackling white supremacist violence, their actions raise continued concerns about how they are using counterterrorism authorities. More troubling, recent reporting that revealed the active participation of police officers in white supremacist groups and racist social media activity by a small but significant number of police officers and border patrol officials makes clear that overt and organized racism continues to fester within agencies sworn to protect the public safety as well. The FBI has repeatedly warned its agents about white supremacist infiltration of law enforcement, urging caution about sharing sensitive intelligence about domestic terrorism cases. But it has taken few concrete actions to protect communities of color from these racist officers. Given this disturbing reality, giving law enforcement greater domestic terrorism powers may not be the safest or most effective solution. So what is Congress to do? Policymakers and intelligence analysts need better data regarding the scope of white supremacist violence in this country and around the world in order to craft more effective responses. A number of pending bills require the justice department to provide this information. We need a new approach, not deeper investments in failed methods. Our latest Brennan Center report urged Congress to find ways the federal government can fund programs designed to repair the communal injuries that hate violence inflicts, by building social inclusion through investments in education, social services, and employment. When white supremacists use violence to divide us, our response should be designed to empower the victimized communities, not just the police.

      "body": "<p>In July 2011, a quiet European capital was shaken by a terrorist car bomb, followed by confused reports suggesting many deaths. When the first news of the murders came through, one small group of online commentators reacted immediately, even though the media had cautiously declined to identify the attackers. They knew at once what had happened \u2013 and who was to blame.</p> <p>\u201cThis was inevitable,\u201d explained one of the anonymous commenters. And it was just the beginning: \u201cOnly a matter of time before other European nations get a taste of their multicultural tolerance that they\u2019ve been cooking for decades.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEurope has been infested with <a href=\"https://gatesofvienna.blogspot.com/2011/07/terror-attack-in-central-oslo.html\" title=\"\">venomous parasitic vermin</a>,\u201d explained another. \u201cAnything and everything is fine as long as they rape the natives and destroy the country, which they do,\u201d said a third.</p> <p>As the news grew worse, the group became more joyful and confident. The car bomb had been followed by reports of a mass shooting at a nearby camp for teenagers. One commenter was \u201calmost crying of happiness\u201d to be proved right about the dangers of Islam. \u201cThe massacre at the children\u2019s camp,\u201d another noted, \u201cis a sickening reminder of just how evil and satanic the cult of Islam is.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/oct/11/the-myth-of-eurabia-how-a-far-right-conspiracy-theory-went-mainstream-podcast\">The myth of Eurabia: how a far-right conspiracy theory went mainstream \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A couple of hours after the first reports of the bomb explosion<strong> </strong>in central Oslo, a few doubts emerged to cloud the picture: \u201cBecause the targets in the shooting were all good little leftists, won\u2019t the shooter be played up as a rightwing extremist, whatever his actual motives?\u201d one person asked.</p> <p>When information emerged to suggest that the attacker might be a \u201ctall Nordic guy\u201d, one of the commenters, who called himself \u201cFjordman\u201d, realised the true nature of the disaster: \u201cJudging from some of the recent information, it must be treated as a serious possibility that this is actually some Timothy McVeigh, not a Muslim. It is too early to tell. If that is indeed the case \u2026 it would practically destroy my country, and make the working conditions for people like myself incredibly difficult for a long time to come, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p> <p>The truth turned out to be worse than Fjordman feared. The massacre in Oslo had not been committed by Muslims. It was the work of a white supremacist, Anders Behring Breivik, who had detonated a bomb in Oslo, killing eight people, and then shot dead 69 others, many of them teenagers, at a youth camp run by Norway\u2019s Labour party. And, according to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/sep/07/anders-breivik-hate-manifesto\" title=\"\">the manifesto</a> he published online, Breivik had been directly inspired by Gates of Vienna \u2013 the blog where all these comments appeared on the day of his massacre. Breivik called the ideology that justified his murders \u201cThe Vienna school\u201d, after the blog.</p> <p>Fjordman, whose real name is Peder Are N\u00f8stvold Jensen, now lives in obscurity in provincial Norway. He outed himself as the man behind the pseudonym to a Norwegian tabloid in the weeks following the massacre \u2013 but managed to avoid testifying at Breivik\u2019s trial, thanks to the intervention of high-powered lawyers paid for by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/07/tommy-robinson-global-support-brexit-march\" title=\"\">Middle East Forum</a>, a rightwing American group that would later <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/07/tommy-robinson-the-us-money-behind-the-far-right-mouthpiece\" title=\"\">sponsor Tommy Robinson</a> \u2013 real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon \u2013 in Britain. Nonetheless, Jensen\u2019s influence on Breivik, however indirect, had been considerable.</p> <p>Breivik borrowed part of the<strong> </strong>title of his manifesto, A European Declaration of Independence, from one of Fjordman\u2019s blog posts, and many<strong> </strong>of the chapters in it were simply reprintings of Fjordman\u2019s postings on various blogs, mostly Gates of Vienna, but also a far-right and passionately anti-EU site called the Brussels Journal.</p> <p>Gates of Vienna was, and still is, run by Edward \u201cNed\u201d May, an American computer programmer from Washington DC. It was among the first in a wave of blogs that urged the US to war after the shock of 9/11, and almost certainly the most fanatically anti-Muslim. It takes its name from the siege of Vienna in 1683, when an Ottoman Turkish army was defeated by a Polish-led one. Its essential thesis is that this was only one battle in a long war and that Europe and its civilisation are constantly threatened by a Muslim invasion.</p> <p>On these varied online forums, the narrative was always the same: a liberal cabal was conspiring with hostile Muslim powers to hand over the decent working people to Islam. This was the animating myth of the bloggers, calling themselves the \u201ccounter-jihad\u201d, who congregated at Gates of Vienna and other like-minded sites \u2013 and inspired both the violence of Breivik and the message of the racist far-right parties that have transformed European politics in the past decade.</p> <p>But all of these later conspiracy theories took inspiration from a founding myth of contemporary Islamophobia: an invented plot, known as \u201cEurabia\u201d, to destroy European civilisation. This is the doctrine that Jensen promoted and Breivik acted on, a hidden underpinning of a movement that has changed the world.</p> <p>Once an ideology confined to the kookier corners of the internet, the idea of Eurabia is now visible in the everyday politics of the US, Australia and most of Europe: when Trump tweets about stabbings in London and falsely claims that crime in Germany is \u201cway up\u201d, he is invoking the Eurabian myth, taken as fact on Fox News, that European liberals have surrendered their cities to Muslim criminals.</p> <p>The spread of the belief that elites conspired to push Muslim immigration on their native populations is also the story of a conspiracy theory that was nourished on some of the very first blogs and message boards, started appearing in mainstream discourse after 9/11, and then took on a life of its own, even while the supposed facts behind it were exposed as ridiculous. It is a lesson in the danger of half-truths, which are not only more powerful than truths but often more powerful than lies.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Eurabia is a term coined in the 70s that was resurfaced by Gis\u00e8le Littman, an Egyptian-born Jewish woman who fled Cairo for Britain after the Suez crisis, and then moved to Switzerland in 1960 with her English husband. She wrote under the name of Bat Ye\u2019or (Hebrew for \u201cDaughter of the Nile\u201d). In a series of books, originally written in French and published from the 1990s onward, she developed a grand conspiracy theory in which the EU, led by French elites, implemented a secret plan to sell out Europe to the Muslims in exchange for oil.</p> <p>The original villain of Littman\u2019s story was General Charles de Gaulle. It is difficult for an outsider to understand how De Gaulle, who led the French resistance to the Nazis and was probably the greatest conservative statesman in French history, could be reinvented as the man who betrayed western civilisation for money. But Littman had lived many years in France, and the French far right hated De Gaulle, and indeed tried several times to assassinate him. Not only had De Gaulle fought the Vichy government, he had also admitted defeat in the long and hideously bloody war of Algerian independence \u2013 granting an Arab Muslim country its freedom at the expense of the French-Christian settler population, who had to retreat to France (and whose descendants formed the backbone of Jean-Marie Le Pen\u2019s National Front).</p> <p>Agreeing to Algerian independence was understood by the French far right as a betrayal. De Gaulle had been brought out of retirement and restored to power in 1958 because he was believed to be on the side of the settlers in their war, which was opposed<strong> </strong>by much of the left. And so, to the far right, the Mediterranean came to seem like the frontline in a long, shifting struggle between rival colonialisms, Christian and Muslim, in which the Muslims had won a great victory in Algeria. Where would their new advance stop?</p> <p>Littman\u2019s argument, framed by her experience in Egypt (which a French force had invaded, along with the British and Israelis, in 1956), was that Islam imposed a second-class status on all non-Muslims, whom they ruled. This status of \u201cdhimmitude\u201d \u2013 a coinage of Littman\u2019s, meaning subjection to Islamic rule on pain of \u201cforced conversion, slavery or death\u201d \u2013 was now to be extended to Europe.</p> <p>According to Littman, her books describe \u201cEurope\u2019s evolution from a Judeo-Christian civilisation, with important post-Enlightenment secular elements, into a post-Judeo-Christian civilisation that is subservient to the ideology of jihad and the Islamic powers that propagate it.\u201d</p> <p>She saw tentacles of the great conspiracy in committees of blameless tedium and obscurity, such as the Euro-Arab Dialogue, an institution set up by the European Economic Community and the Arab League in the 70s to promote greater discussion between the regions.<strong> </strong>Her conspiracy theory was dismissed in 2006 by the Israeli historian Robert Wistrich as \u201cthe protocols of the elders of Brussels\u201d, but what mattered more was the place he chose to challenge her ideas: a conference in Jerusalem on antisemitism to which she had been invited despite her lack of academic status. September 11 had changed everything for Littman, <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/1.4919785\" title=\"\">she told Haaretz after the conference</a>: \u201cIn the United States, I am certain that the September 11 attacks woke people up, including the Jewish community that had previously ignored me, because it belongs more to the left.\u201d</p> <p>She explained to Haaretz the future she saw for Europe. \u201cWe are now heading towards a total change in Europe, which will be more and more Islamicised and will become a political satellite of the Arab and Muslim world.\u201d</p> <p>This was the idea that the Norwegian Jensen was enchanted by, and which, as Fjordman, he transmitted to Anders Breivik.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b605955a2f7a22a1d2e15fb80ec9aa5490eed362\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b605955a2f7a22a1d2e15fb80ec9aa5490eed362/0_64_5329_3198/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marine Le Pen, president of France\u2019s far-right National Rally (formerly National Front) party, applauds the former US presidential adviser Steve Bannon after his speech at the party\u2019s annual congress in March 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marine Le Pen, president of France\u2019s far-right National Rally (formerly National Front) party, applauds the former US presidential adviser Steve Bannon (left) after his speech at the party\u2019s annual congress in March 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philippe Huguen/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jensen is unusual among Eurabia believers in that he has actually had some experience of the Muslim world and even speaks Arabic. He is the son of a socialist politician in Norway and studied Arabic in Cairo \u2013 his earlier university studies in Bergen had included English (which he writes fluently), Russian, Arabic and Middle Eastern history. In 2000, he had been interviewed by the local paper back in Norway, and spoke enthusiastically about his hosts in Egypt: \u201cOutside the tourist areas, you meet friendly, hospitable, curious and open people who want to get to know you. I have been part of their daily lives. We\u2019ve been invited to their homes, and talked and smoked shisha together.\u201d</p> <p>That was Jensen\u2019s first encounter with Islam, and he was still in Cairo at the time of the 9/11 attacks. He says he saw then that there were some Muslims who celebrated the slaughter, and he also saw that this wasn\u2019t reported in the Norwegian papers. The next year, he worked for the Norwegian Refugee Council in the disputed city of Hebron in the occupied West Bank. Unusually among Scandinavians who have worked with Palestinians in Israel, he identified with the Israelis. He narrowly escaped a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv, at a bar where two of his colleagues had been killed in another attack the previous year. The experience cemented his growing fear and loathing of Islam.</p> <p>The fact that the Norwegian press took a generally pro-Palestinian line while he and his friends had been the victims of Palestinian terrorism helped to convince Jensen that Islam was an existential threat to European civilisation which the politically correct establishment was wilfully ignoring. Like Littman, he seems not to acknowledge any element of nationalism in Palestinian consciousness: it is all either Arab or Muslim. In fact, the belief that Islam is hostile to national consciousness is quite widely held on the right: the philosopher Roger Scruton brought it up in a controversial speech on nationality in Hungary in 2013, in which he contrasted European Christian nations with Islamic empires.</p> <p>In 2003, Jensen returned to Norway, where he attempted to make a name for himself as a public intellectual. At first, he was hostile to feminism, accusing feminists of destroying Norwegian manhood. But the focus of his concerns soon switched to Islam. He started writing under the pseudonym \u201cNorwegian Kafir\u201d on an American blog called Little Green Footballs, which loudly and fervently supported the invasion of Iraq. From then on, his writing appeared in English, on American-hosted blogs. There, he hammered into shape the narrative of elites, specially identified with the EU, who are destroying and betraying Europe by the deliberate encouragement of mass immigration.</p> <p>At this point in time, the Eurabian conspiracy appealed largely to those who had long perceived a conflict between Islam and the Judeo-Christian west \u2013 with Israel as a beleaguered and persecuted outpost of western values. These people, largely on the American right, were among the earliest exponents of Eurabia \u2013 but as they never ceased to complain, theirs was not an attitude very widely shared in Europe. What would soon supply the emotional force of the fantasy was another set of ideas about global migration, less conspiratorial in their essence, but much more widely accepted among generally apolitical Europeans. These, also, originated in France, where they were known as the \u201cgreat replacement\u201d.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The idea of the great replacement had its origin in a blatantly racist French novel of the 1970s, The Camp of the Saints, in which France is overthrown by an unarmed invasion of starving, sex-crazed Indian refugees when the French army is not prepared to fire on them. The moral of the book is that western civilisation can only be saved by a willingness to slaughter poor brown people. Steve Bannon, among the founders of the rightwing news site Breitbart and a former adviser to President Trump, has referred to it repeatedly.</p> <p>Throughout the 80s and 90s, the naked racism of The Camp of the Saints kept it largely out of public debate. But the rise of Islam as a global force allowed the question to be recast. If the threatening masses were defined by religion rather than by skin colour, then hating them could be presented as an intellectual commitment rather than a racist one.</p> <p>And the paranoid did have a large, shadowy half-truth to fall back on. The demographic shrinkage facing Europe is real and undeniable, and it was obvious in the early years of this century, too. So are the much greater birth rates in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia. In 2002, Russia and Pakistan both had populations of about 145 million; by 2017, Russia\u2019s population was 144 million while Pakistan\u2019s was 200 million.</p> <p>The next stage in the development of a xenophobic populist worldview was for the two narratives to merge, so that Islam and Muslims became both a conspiracy and a demographic threat.</p> <p>The 9/11 attacks changed attitudes to Islam in much of Europe and the US. Israel and the US now shared a sense of being under attack from Muslims. Without 9/11, Littman would have remained an obscure crank, and Jensen more obscure still. But the assault on the twin towers unleashed an immense backlash of wounded American pride and nationalism that led to the devastation of two whole countries, Afghanistan and Iraq, and countless deaths. It also fuelled a demand for explanations. Theories about the unique malevolence and danger of Islam answered a popular hunger. George W Bush declared at the time that the US had no quarrel with Islam, but many of his compatriots disagreed.</p> <p>One of the many bad fruits of 9/11 was the new atheist movement, a phenomenon marked by mutual self-praise and undeviating hostility to Islam. Even if the ostensible target of much of the hostility was Christianity, the new atheists tend to consider Islam far worse and more \u201creligious\u201d a religion. The American writer Sam Harris\u2019s breakthrough book The End of Faith from 2004 now reads like Bat Ye\u2019or without the inconvenient scaffolding of easily disproved facts. \u201cWe are at war with Islam,\u201d he writes. \u201cIt may not serve our immediate foreign policy objectives for our political leaders to openly acknowledge this fact, but it is unambiguously so. It is not merely that we are at war with an otherwise peaceful religion that has been \u2018hijacked\u2019 by extremists \u2026 Armed conflict \u2018in the defence of Islam\u2019 is a religious obligation for every Muslim man ... Islam, more than any religion humans have ever devised, has the makings of a thoroughgoing cult of death.\u201d</p> <p>In the run-up to the Iraq war, and after the invasion, coverage in American newspapers and on television was, to a European eye, jingoistic in the extreme. The possibility of defeat was unthinkable. Nonetheless, a new wave of bloggers began using the term \u201cMSM\u201d for \u201cmainstream media\u201d as a disparaging reference to the large media organisations\u2019 pretended neutrality. One of the earliest and most influential of these was Little Green Footballs, founded and run by Charles Johnson, a Los Angeles-based former session guitarist with an interest in web design. It was typical of the moment that he was an opinionated amateur with no credentials, whose real advantage was that he could build websites at a time when this required some programming skill.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jensen, commenting on Little Green Footballs as Norwegian Kafir, made it a distribution point for Eurabian ideas. Another was Gates of Vienna itself, run by Ned May under the moniker Baron Bodissey after a sage in the sci-fi novels of Jack Vance. Then there was Jihad Watch, run by the American author Robert Spencer. Both Spencer and his frequent collaborator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/oct/13/ground-zero-islam\" title=\"\">Pam Geller</a> were banned from the UK in 2013 for making statements likely to foster hatred and violence between communities.</p> <p>The only European blog of note in this constellation was the fanatically anti-EU site the Brussels Journal, where the Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan was a contributor. The Brussels Journal was run by Paul Beli\u00ebn, a far-right Belgian journalist and author. Jensen was active on all these sites, taking part in discussions in which the Eurabian beliefs gave rise to something that called itself the counter-jihad movement.</p> <p>Nowadays, when Facebook effortlessly spreads disinformation around the world, it is difficult to recapture the sense of revelation, and of belonging, that once accompanied the discovery of a new blog. The cramped but, to its adherents, strangely comforting thought world of the counter-jihad blogs turned politics into a gigantic online game. Anyone could play and everyone could find in it their inner child: \u201cSome people think I\u2019m weird; some think I am exceptionally intelligent,\u201d Jensen had told a reporter when he was still a student in Cairo.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The boundaries between these blogs and the \u201cMSM\u201d they affected to despise were porous. Some writers aimed for a high-minded tone about the dangers of Muslim immigration: the former Financial Times columnist Christopher Caldwell published in 2009 a book, Reflections on a Revolution in Europe, that recapitulates the idea of a slow-moving Muslim barbarian invasion from a position of Olympian disdain: \u201cImmigrants also bring a lot of disorder, penury and crime \u2026 Muslim culture is unusually full of messages laying out the practical advantages of procreation \u2026 If you walk north across the Piazza Della Repubblica in Turin, you see, mutatis mutandis, what the Romans saw. To the east, two well-preserved Roman towers remain, and so do the walls built to separate citizens from barbarians. Today, in the space of about 60 seconds on foot, you pass from chic shops and wine bars through a lively multiethnic market into one of Europe\u2019s more menacing north African slums.\u201d</p> <p>Some were less highbrow. In 2004, the Daily Telegraph gave a column to the Canadian prophet of American greatness Mark Steyn, who had originally made his name as a witty critic of musical theatre. Doom and horror was all he saw in Europe\u2019s future. As early as 2002, he said: \u201cI find it easier to be optimistic about the futures of Iraq and Pakistan than, say, Holland or Denmark\u201d \u2013 a remark he was still proudly quoting for Telegraph readers <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3621039/Bicultural-Europe-is-doomed.html\" title=\"\">in 2005</a>, when Iraq had become a slaughterhouse.</p> <p>In terms that anticipated Jensen, Breivik and the alleged manifesto of the man charged with the Christchurch massacre, Steyn wrote (and the Telegraph published) this prophecy: \u201cIn a democratic age, you can\u2019t buck demography \u2013 except through civil war. The Yugoslavs figured that out. In the 30 years before the meltdown, Bosnian Serbs had declined from 43% to 31% of the population, while Bosnian Muslims had increased from 26% to 44%.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"03d6695b9689f666c8d81556f32d38b6bb73e54f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/03d6695b9689f666c8d81556f32d38b6bb73e54f/0_189_4695_2817/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Europeans, vote for AfD, so that Europe will never become \u2018Eurabia\u2019!\u2019 reads a campaign poster in Berlin for the far-right party during this year\u2019s European elections.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Europeans, vote for AfD, so that Europe will never become \u2018Eurabia\u2019!\u2019 reads a campaign poster in Berlin for the far-right party during this year\u2019s European elections.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clemens Bilan/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Compare Steyn in 2005 with the manifesto of Patrick Crusius, who confessed to murdering 22 people in El Paso earlier this month: \u201cThis attack is a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas. They are the instigators, not me. I am simply defending my country from cultural and ethnic replacement brought on by an invasion ... America is rotting from the inside out, and peaceful means to stop this seem to be nearly impossible.\u201d</p> <p>In 2007, the believers in a counter-jihad began to meet up in the real world. After a preliminary meeting of bloggers, commentators and Danish and Norwegian sympathisers in Copenhagen, attended by Jensen, a conference was arranged by May and the far-right Flemish party Vlaams Belang, in Brussels in 2007. This brought together most of the ideologues of Eurabia, as they attempted to transform it from an idea into a movement. Littman was the keynote speaker. Others present were Geller and Robert Spencer from the US, and Gerard Batten, later briefly the leader of Ukip in Britain. Ted Ekeroth, of the nationalist, rightwing Sweden Democrats, also attended.</p> <p>As both Ukip and the Sweden Democrats rose to become powerful political forces, anxieties about terrorism were subsumed into much wider anxieties about demography, and about status within the old order. The American anthropologist Scott Atran has carried out extensive research into the mindset of the young men who become Islamic terrorists: the combination of wounded pride with the delight of belonging to a movement which has both global, apocalyptic significance and a living presence in a friendship group is tremendously important in recruiting jihadis. The same dynamic operates among their enemies: Breivik was remarkable chiefly in that he was so solipsistic that he could radicalise himself without the aid of any friends in real life, only those he imagined on the internet. He had at one stage approached his intellectual idol, Jensen, via email, who brushed him off as \u201cboring as a vacuum cleaner salesman\u201d.</p> <p>You do not have to be a jihadi to feel the tug of these compulsions. The counter-jihadis, just as much as their enemies, believed they were entering an apocalyptic battle between good and evil. This is a century of wounded pride and anxieties about status for almost everyone.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Despite all this, there were some signs, even before the Breivik killings, that the original Eurabian front would break up. Those who were opposed to immigrants in general began to separate from those who hated Muslims in particular. Johnson, the founder of Little Green Footballs, excommunicated most of his followers in 2010 because of their increasing closeness to parties of western Europe that he regarded as being descended from fascists \u2013 the Vlaams Belang in Belgium and the Sweden Democrats, although he also denounced the English Defence League. Johnson was a genuine philosemite, who could not forgive the taint of antisemitism.</p> <p>The anti-immigrant right had good reasons for separating itself from the anti-Muslim right. If the logic of the \u201cVienna school\u201d \u2013 Jensen, Spencer and Geller, May and Littman \u2013 led inexorably to civil war and the righteous slaughter of Muslims and their leftie enablers, then most of the right shrank back from it. Commenters such as <a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/2011/07/breivik-and-the-right/\" title=\"\">Douglas Murray</a> and Caldwell quite genuinely believed that Breivik was insane, and that his actions had no relation to the ideas that he espoused. There may in this have been an element of self-deception, but it is also a testimony to the sort of instinctive, unthinking decency we all need sometimes to rescue us from the consequences of our ideas. It seemed that some kind of pragmatism would prevail.</p> <p>The hope now seems deceptive. What changed this was above all the election of the US president, Donald Trump, whose then adviser Bannon was a believer in a \u201cbrutal, bloody ... global war\u201d against \u201cIslamic fascism\u201d. They showed that there was a huge constituency for racialised hatred and despair and \u2013 for them \u2013 no real negative consequences, electoral or otherwise, in pandering to it.</p> <p>Since Breivik\u2019s massacre, his own beliefs have only become more widespread. They have spread into the politics of all European countries. In the campaign for the European elections this May, the German far-right party AfD ran posters showing a naked white woman being pawed by dark-skinned men in Arab headgear. One had stuck his fingers in her unresisting mouth. \u201cEuropeans, vote for AfD, so that Europe will never become \u2018Eurabia\u2019,\u201d said the caption. Millions of people who have never heard of Bat Ye\u2019or, of Fjordman, or even of Breivik and Bannon, now understand that poster at a glance, and no amount of evidence will shake their certainty. They now believe all politics comes down to the words of one of Trump\u2019s more recent tweets: \u201cThe losers all want what you have, don\u2019t give it to them \u2026 Be strong &amp; prosper, be weak &amp; die!\u201d</p> <p>But who, in this situation, are the losers, and who are the strong? Last week, in an apparent attempt to emulate Breivik, a rich, disaffected young Norwegian, Philip Manshaus, shot his way through the entrance gates to a mosque in the upmarket suburb of Oslo where he lived and started firing at the congregation. He was wrestled to the ground by an unarmed 65-year-old Muslim, Mohammed Rafiq, who then held him down, with the help of another man, until the police arrived. On the Gates of Vienna blog, this episode was not deemed worthy of mention. Instead, its devoted readers were told that Muslims had been responsible for a recent outbreak of animal cruelty in Sweden.</p> <p>\u2022Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In July 2011, a quiet European capital was shaken by a terrorist car bomb, followed by confused reports suggesting many deaths. When the first news of the murders came through, one small group of online commentators reacted immediately, even though the media had cautiously declined to identify the attackers. They knew at once what had happened \u2013 and who was to blame. \u201cThis was inevitable,\u201d explained one of the anonymous commenters. And it was just the beginning: \u201cOnly a matter of time before other European nations get a taste of their multicultural tolerance that they\u2019ve been cooking for decades.\u201d \u201cEurope has been infested with venomous parasitic vermin,\u201d explained another. \u201cAnything and everything is fine as long as they rape the natives and destroy the country, which they do,\u201d said a third. As the news grew worse, the group became more joyful and confident. The car bomb had been followed by reports of a mass shooting at a nearby camp for teenagers. One commenter was \u201calmost crying of happiness\u201d to be proved right about the dangers of Islam. \u201cThe massacre at the children\u2019s camp,\u201d another noted, \u201cis a sickening reminder of just how evil and satanic the cult of Islam is.\u201d A couple of hours after the first reports of the bomb explosion in central Oslo, a few doubts emerged to cloud the picture: \u201cBecause the targets in the shooting were all good little leftists, won\u2019t the shooter be played up as a rightwing extremist, whatever his actual motives?\u201d one person asked. When information emerged to suggest that the attacker might be a \u201ctall Nordic guy\u201d, one of the commenters, who called himself \u201cFjordman\u201d, realised the true nature of the disaster: \u201cJudging from some of the recent information, it must be treated as a serious possibility that this is actually some Timothy McVeigh, not a Muslim. It is too early to tell. If that is indeed the case \u2026 it would practically destroy my country, and make the working conditions for people like myself incredibly difficult for a long time to come, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d The truth turned out to be worse than Fjordman feared. The massacre in Oslo had not been committed by Muslims. It was the work of a white supremacist, Anders Behring Breivik, who had detonated a bomb in Oslo, killing eight people, and then shot dead 69 others, many of them teenagers, at a youth camp run by Norway\u2019s Labour party. And, according to the manifesto he published online, Breivik had been directly inspired by Gates of Vienna \u2013 the blog where all these comments appeared on the day of his massacre. Breivik called the ideology that justified his murders \u201cThe Vienna school\u201d, after the blog. Fjordman, whose real name is Peder Are N\u00f8stvold Jensen, now lives in obscurity in provincial Norway. He outed himself as the man behind the pseudonym to a Norwegian tabloid in the weeks following the massacre \u2013 but managed to avoid testifying at Breivik\u2019s trial, thanks to the intervention of high-powered lawyers paid for by the Middle East Forum, a rightwing American group that would later sponsor Tommy Robinson \u2013 real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon \u2013 in Britain. Nonetheless, Jensen\u2019s influence on Breivik, however indirect, had been considerable. Breivik borrowed part of the title of his manifesto, A European Declaration of Independence, from one of Fjordman\u2019s blog posts, and many of the chapters in it were simply reprintings of Fjordman\u2019s postings on various blogs, mostly Gates of Vienna, but also a far-right and passionately anti-EU site called the Brussels Journal. Gates of Vienna was, and still is, run by Edward \u201cNed\u201d May, an American computer programmer from Washington DC. It was among the first in a wave of blogs that urged the US to war after the shock of 9/11, and almost certainly the most fanatically anti-Muslim. It takes its name from the siege of Vienna in 1683, when an Ottoman Turkish army was defeated by a Polish-led one. Its essential thesis is that this was only one battle in a long war and that Europe and its civilisation are constantly threatened by a Muslim invasion. On these varied online forums, the narrative was always the same: a liberal cabal was conspiring with hostile Muslim powers to hand over the decent working people to Islam. This was the animating myth of the bloggers, calling themselves the \u201ccounter-jihad\u201d, who congregated at Gates of Vienna and other like-minded sites \u2013 and inspired both the violence of Breivik and the message of the racist far-right parties that have transformed European politics in the past decade. But all of these later conspiracy theories took inspiration from a founding myth of contemporary Islamophobia: an invented plot, known as \u201cEurabia\u201d, to destroy European civilisation. This is the doctrine that Jensen promoted and Breivik acted on, a hidden underpinning of a movement that has changed the world. Once an ideology confined to the kookier corners of the internet, the idea of Eurabia is now visible in the everyday politics of the US, Australia and most of Europe: when Trump tweets about stabbings in London and falsely claims that crime in Germany is \u201cway up\u201d, he is invoking the Eurabian myth, taken as fact on Fox News, that European liberals have surrendered their cities to Muslim criminals. The spread of the belief that elites conspired to push Muslim immigration on their native populations is also the story of a conspiracy theory that was nourished on some of the very first blogs and message boards, started appearing in mainstream discourse after 9/11, and then took on a life of its own, even while the supposed facts behind it were exposed as ridiculous. It is a lesson in the danger of half-truths, which are not only more powerful than truths but often more powerful than lies. * * * Eurabia is a term coined in the 70s that was resurfaced by Gis\u00e8le Littman, an Egyptian-born Jewish woman who fled Cairo for Britain after the Suez crisis, and then moved to Switzerland in 1960 with her English husband. She wrote under the name of Bat Ye\u2019or (Hebrew for \u201cDaughter of the Nile\u201d). In a series of books, originally written in French and published from the 1990s onward, she developed a grand conspiracy theory in which the EU, led by French elites, implemented a secret plan to sell out Europe to the Muslims in exchange for oil. The original villain of Littman\u2019s story was General Charles de Gaulle. It is difficult for an outsider to understand how De Gaulle, who led the French resistance to the Nazis and was probably the greatest conservative statesman in French history, could be reinvented as the man who betrayed western civilisation for money. But Littman had lived many years in France, and the French far right hated De Gaulle, and indeed tried several times to assassinate him. Not only had De Gaulle fought the Vichy government, he had also admitted defeat in the long and hideously bloody war of Algerian independence \u2013 granting an Arab Muslim country its freedom at the expense of the French-Christian settler population, who had to retreat to France (and whose descendants formed the backbone of Jean-Marie Le Pen\u2019s National Front). Agreeing to Algerian independence was understood by the French far right as a betrayal. De Gaulle had been brought out of retirement and restored to power in 1958 because he was believed to be on the side of the settlers in their war, which was opposed by much of the left. And so, to the far right, the Mediterranean came to seem like the frontline in a long, shifting struggle between rival colonialisms, Christian and Muslim, in which the Muslims had won a great victory in Algeria. Where would their new advance stop? Littman\u2019s argument, framed by her experience in Egypt (which a French force had invaded, along with the British and Israelis, in 1956), was that Islam imposed a second-class status on all non-Muslims, whom they ruled. This status of \u201cdhimmitude\u201d \u2013 a coinage of Littman\u2019s, meaning subjection to Islamic rule on pain of \u201cforced conversion, slavery or death\u201d \u2013 was now to be extended to Europe. According to Littman, her books describe \u201cEurope\u2019s evolution from a Judeo-Christian civilisation, with important post-Enlightenment secular elements, into a post-Judeo-Christian civilisation that is subservient to the ideology of jihad and the Islamic powers that propagate it.\u201d She saw tentacles of the great conspiracy in committees of blameless tedium and obscurity, such as the Euro-Arab Dialogue, an institution set up by the European Economic Community and the Arab League in the 70s to promote greater discussion between the regions. Her conspiracy theory was dismissed in 2006 by the Israeli historian Robert Wistrich as \u201cthe protocols of the elders of Brussels\u201d, but what mattered more was the place he chose to challenge her ideas: a conference in Jerusalem on antisemitism to which she had been invited despite her lack of academic status. September 11 had changed everything for Littman, she told Haaretz after the conference: \u201cIn the United States, I am certain that the September 11 attacks woke people up, including the Jewish community that had previously ignored me, because it belongs more to the left.\u201d She explained to Haaretz the future she saw for Europe. \u201cWe are now heading towards a total change in Europe, which will be more and more Islamicised and will become a political satellite of the Arab and Muslim world.\u201d This was the idea that the Norwegian Jensen was enchanted by, and which, as Fjordman, he transmitted to Anders Breivik. Jensen is unusual among Eurabia believers in that he has actually had some experience of the Muslim world and even speaks Arabic. He is the son of a socialist politician in Norway and studied Arabic in Cairo \u2013 his earlier university studies in Bergen had included English (which he writes fluently), Russian, Arabic and Middle Eastern history. In 2000, he had been interviewed by the local paper back in Norway, and spoke enthusiastically about his hosts in Egypt: \u201cOutside the tourist areas, you meet friendly, hospitable, curious and open people who want to get to know you. I have been part of their daily lives. We\u2019ve been invited to their homes, and talked and smoked shisha together.\u201d That was Jensen\u2019s first encounter with Islam, and he was still in Cairo at the time of the 9/11 attacks. He says he saw then that there were some Muslims who celebrated the slaughter, and he also saw that this wasn\u2019t reported in the Norwegian papers. The next year, he worked for the Norwegian Refugee Council in the disputed city of Hebron in the occupied West Bank. Unusually among Scandinavians who have worked with Palestinians in Israel, he identified with the Israelis. He narrowly escaped a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv, at a bar where two of his colleagues had been killed in another attack the previous year. The experience cemented his growing fear and loathing of Islam. The fact that the Norwegian press took a generally pro-Palestinian line while he and his friends had been the victims of Palestinian terrorism helped to convince Jensen that Islam was an existential threat to European civilisation which the politically correct establishment was wilfully ignoring. Like Littman, he seems not to acknowledge any element of nationalism in Palestinian consciousness: it is all either Arab or Muslim. In fact, the belief that Islam is hostile to national consciousness is quite widely held on the right: the philosopher Roger Scruton brought it up in a controversial speech on nationality in Hungary in 2013, in which he contrasted European Christian nations with Islamic empires. In 2003, Jensen returned to Norway, where he attempted to make a name for himself as a public intellectual. At first, he was hostile to feminism, accusing feminists of destroying Norwegian manhood. But the focus of his concerns soon switched to Islam. He started writing under the pseudonym \u201cNorwegian Kafir\u201d on an American blog called Little Green Footballs, which loudly and fervently supported the invasion of Iraq. From then on, his writing appeared in English, on American-hosted blogs. There, he hammered into shape the narrative of elites, specially identified with the EU, who are destroying and betraying Europe by the deliberate encouragement of mass immigration. At this point in time, the Eurabian conspiracy appealed largely to those who had long perceived a conflict between Islam and the Judeo-Christian west \u2013 with Israel as a beleaguered and persecuted outpost of western values. These people, largely on the American right, were among the earliest exponents of Eurabia \u2013 but as they never ceased to complain, theirs was not an attitude very widely shared in Europe. What would soon supply the emotional force of the fantasy was another set of ideas about global migration, less conspiratorial in their essence, but much more widely accepted among generally apolitical Europeans. These, also, originated in France, where they were known as the \u201cgreat replacement\u201d. * * * The idea of the great replacement had its origin in a blatantly racist French novel of the 1970s, The Camp of the Saints, in which France is overthrown by an unarmed invasion of starving, sex-crazed Indian refugees when the French army is not prepared to fire on them. The moral of the book is that western civilisation can only be saved by a willingness to slaughter poor brown people. Steve Bannon, among the founders of the rightwing news site Breitbart and a former adviser to President Trump, has referred to it repeatedly. Throughout the 80s and 90s, the naked racism of The Camp of the Saints kept it largely out of public debate. But the rise of Islam as a global force allowed the question to be recast. If the threatening masses were defined by religion rather than by skin colour, then hating them could be presented as an intellectual commitment rather than a racist one. And the paranoid did have a large, shadowy half-truth to fall back on. The demographic shrinkage facing Europe is real and undeniable, and it was obvious in the early years of this century, too. So are the much greater birth rates in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia. In 2002, Russia and Pakistan both had populations of about 145 million; by 2017, Russia\u2019s population was 144 million while Pakistan\u2019s was 200 million. The next stage in the development of a xenophobic populist worldview was for the two narratives to merge, so that Islam and Muslims became both a conspiracy and a demographic threat. The 9/11 attacks changed attitudes to Islam in much of Europe and the US. Israel and the US now shared a sense of being under attack from Muslims. Without 9/11, Littman would have remained an obscure crank, and Jensen more obscure still. But the assault on the twin towers unleashed an immense backlash of wounded American pride and nationalism that led to the devastation of two whole countries, Afghanistan and Iraq, and countless deaths. It also fuelled a demand for explanations. Theories about the unique malevolence and danger of Islam answered a popular hunger. George W Bush declared at the time that the US had no quarrel with Islam, but many of his compatriots disagreed. One of the many bad fruits of 9/11 was the new atheist movement, a phenomenon marked by mutual self-praise and undeviating hostility to Islam. Even if the ostensible target of much of the hostility was Christianity, the new atheists tend to consider Islam far worse and more \u201creligious\u201d a religion. The American writer Sam Harris\u2019s breakthrough book The End of Faith from 2004 now reads like Bat Ye\u2019or without the inconvenient scaffolding of easily disproved facts. \u201cWe are at war with Islam,\u201d he writes. \u201cIt may not serve our immediate foreign policy objectives for our political leaders to openly acknowledge this fact, but it is unambiguously so. It is not merely that we are at war with an otherwise peaceful religion that has been \u2018hijacked\u2019 by extremists \u2026 Armed conflict \u2018in the defence of Islam\u2019 is a religious obligation for every Muslim man ... Islam, more than any religion humans have ever devised, has the makings of a thoroughgoing cult of death.\u201d In the run-up to the Iraq war, and after the invasion, coverage in American newspapers and on television was, to a European eye, jingoistic in the extreme. The possibility of defeat was unthinkable. Nonetheless, a new wave of bloggers began using the term \u201cMSM\u201d for \u201cmainstream media\u201d as a disparaging reference to the large media organisations\u2019 pretended neutrality. One of the earliest and most influential of these was Little Green Footballs, founded and run by Charles Johnson, a Los Angeles-based former session guitarist with an interest in web design. It was typical of the moment that he was an opinionated amateur with no credentials, whose real advantage was that he could build websites at a time when this required some programming skill. Jensen, commenting on Little Green Footballs as Norwegian Kafir, made it a distribution point for Eurabian ideas. Another was Gates of Vienna itself, run by Ned May under the moniker Baron Bodissey after a sage in the sci-fi novels of Jack Vance. Then there was Jihad Watch, run by the American author Robert Spencer. Both Spencer and his frequent collaborator Pam Geller were banned from the UK in 2013 for making statements likely to foster hatred and violence between communities. The only European blog of note in this constellation was the fanatically anti-EU site the Brussels Journal, where the Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan was a contributor. The Brussels Journal was run by Paul Beli\u00ebn, a far-right Belgian journalist and author. Jensen was active on all these sites, taking part in discussions in which the Eurabian beliefs gave rise to something that called itself the counter-jihad movement. Nowadays, when Facebook effortlessly spreads disinformation around the world, it is difficult to recapture the sense of revelation, and of belonging, that once accompanied the discovery of a new blog. The cramped but, to its adherents, strangely comforting thought world of the counter-jihad blogs turned politics into a gigantic online game. Anyone could play and everyone could find in it their inner child: \u201cSome people think I\u2019m weird; some think I am exceptionally intelligent,\u201d Jensen had told a reporter when he was still a student in Cairo. * * * The boundaries between these blogs and the \u201cMSM\u201d they affected to despise were porous. Some writers aimed for a high-minded tone about the dangers of Muslim immigration: the former Financial Times columnist Christopher Caldwell published in 2009 a book, Reflections on a Revolution in Europe, that recapitulates the idea of a slow-moving Muslim barbarian invasion from a position of Olympian disdain: \u201cImmigrants also bring a lot of disorder, penury and crime \u2026 Muslim culture is unusually full of messages laying out the practical advantages of procreation \u2026 If you walk north across the Piazza Della Repubblica in Turin, you see, mutatis mutandis, what the Romans saw. To the east, two well-preserved Roman towers remain, and so do the walls built to separate citizens from barbarians. Today, in the space of about 60 seconds on foot, you pass from chic shops and wine bars through a lively multiethnic market into one of Europe\u2019s more menacing north African slums.\u201d Some were less highbrow. In 2004, the Daily Telegraph gave a column to the Canadian prophet of American greatness Mark Steyn, who had originally made his name as a witty critic of musical theatre. Doom and horror was all he saw in Europe\u2019s future. As early as 2002, he said: \u201cI find it easier to be optimistic about the futures of Iraq and Pakistan than, say, Holland or Denmark\u201d \u2013 a remark he was still proudly quoting for Telegraph readers in 2005, when Iraq had become a slaughterhouse. In terms that anticipated Jensen, Breivik and the alleged manifesto of the man charged with the Christchurch massacre, Steyn wrote (and the Telegraph published) this prophecy: \u201cIn a democratic age, you can\u2019t buck demography \u2013 except through civil war. The Yugoslavs figured that out. In the 30 years before the meltdown, Bosnian Serbs had declined from 43% to 31% of the population, while Bosnian Muslims had increased from 26% to 44%.\u201d Compare Steyn in 2005 with the manifesto of Patrick Crusius, who confessed to murdering 22 people in El Paso earlier this month: \u201cThis attack is a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas. They are the instigators, not me. I am simply defending my country from cultural and ethnic replacement brought on by an invasion ... America is rotting from the inside out, and peaceful means to stop this seem to be nearly impossible.\u201d In 2007, the believers in a counter-jihad began to meet up in the real world. After a preliminary meeting of bloggers, commentators and Danish and Norwegian sympathisers in Copenhagen, attended by Jensen, a conference was arranged by May and the far-right Flemish party Vlaams Belang, in Brussels in 2007. This brought together most of the ideologues of Eurabia, as they attempted to transform it from an idea into a movement. Littman was the keynote speaker. Others present were Geller and Robert Spencer from the US, and Gerard Batten, later briefly the leader of Ukip in Britain. Ted Ekeroth, of the nationalist, rightwing Sweden Democrats, also attended. As both Ukip and the Sweden Democrats rose to become powerful political forces, anxieties about terrorism were subsumed into much wider anxieties about demography, and about status within the old order. The American anthropologist Scott Atran has carried out extensive research into the mindset of the young men who become Islamic terrorists: the combination of wounded pride with the delight of belonging to a movement which has both global, apocalyptic significance and a living presence in a friendship group is tremendously important in recruiting jihadis. The same dynamic operates among their enemies: Breivik was remarkable chiefly in that he was so solipsistic that he could radicalise himself without the aid of any friends in real life, only those he imagined on the internet. He had at one stage approached his intellectual idol, Jensen, via email, who brushed him off as \u201cboring as a vacuum cleaner salesman\u201d. You do not have to be a jihadi to feel the tug of these compulsions. The counter-jihadis, just as much as their enemies, believed they were entering an apocalyptic battle between good and evil. This is a century of wounded pride and anxieties about status for almost everyone. * * * Despite all this, there were some signs, even before the Breivik killings, that the original Eurabian front would break up. Those who were opposed to immigrants in general began to separate from those who hated Muslims in particular. Johnson, the founder of Little Green Footballs, excommunicated most of his followers in 2010 because of their increasing closeness to parties of western Europe that he regarded as being descended from fascists \u2013 the Vlaams Belang in Belgium and the Sweden Democrats, although he also denounced the English Defence League. Johnson was a genuine philosemite, who could not forgive the taint of antisemitism. The anti-immigrant right had good reasons for separating itself from the anti-Muslim right. If the logic of the \u201cVienna school\u201d \u2013 Jensen, Spencer and Geller, May and Littman \u2013 led inexorably to civil war and the righteous slaughter of Muslims and their leftie enablers, then most of the right shrank back from it. Commenters such as Douglas Murray and Caldwell quite genuinely believed that Breivik was insane, and that his actions had no relation to the ideas that he espoused. There may in this have been an element of self-deception, but it is also a testimony to the sort of instinctive, unthinking decency we all need sometimes to rescue us from the consequences of our ideas. It seemed that some kind of pragmatism would prevail. The hope now seems deceptive. What changed this was above all the election of the US president, Donald Trump, whose then adviser Bannon was a believer in a \u201cbrutal, bloody ... global war\u201d against \u201cIslamic fascism\u201d. They showed that there was a huge constituency for racialised hatred and despair and \u2013 for them \u2013 no real negative consequences, electoral or otherwise, in pandering to it. Since Breivik\u2019s massacre, his own beliefs have only become more widespread. They have spread into the politics of all European countries. In the campaign for the European elections this May, the German far-right party AfD ran posters showing a naked white woman being pawed by dark-skinned men in Arab headgear. One had stuck his fingers in her unresisting mouth. \u201cEuropeans, vote for AfD, so that Europe will never become \u2018Eurabia\u2019,\u201d said the caption. Millions of people who have never heard of Bat Ye\u2019or, of Fjordman, or even of Breivik and Bannon, now understand that poster at a glance, and no amount of evidence will shake their certainty. They now believe all politics comes down to the words of one of Trump\u2019s more recent tweets: \u201cThe losers all want what you have, don\u2019t give it to them \u2026 Be strong &amp; prosper, be weak &amp; die!\u201d But who, in this situation, are the losers, and who are the strong? Last week, in an apparent attempt to emulate Breivik, a rich, disaffected young Norwegian, Philip Manshaus, shot his way through the entrance gates to a mosque in the upmarket suburb of Oslo where he lived and started firing at the congregation. He was wrestled to the ground by an unarmed 65-year-old Muslim, Mohammed Rafiq, who then held him down, with the help of another man, until the police arrived. On the Gates of Vienna blog, this episode was not deemed worthy of mention. Instead, its devoted readers were told that Muslims had been responsible for a recent outbreak of animal cruelty in Sweden. \u2022Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

However, not everyone has considered the event worth commemorating in such style. Paradoxically, given its own reporter\u2019s work (a 10,000-word dispatch) was followed by a thunderous denunciation of the behaviour of the troops in a leading article, the Times has chosen to cast doubt on Peterloo\u2019s significance. <a href=\"https://kmflett.wordpress.com/2019/08/03/the-murdoch-times-rubbishes-the-papers-own-creditable-history-on-peterloo/\" title=\"\">In a recent editorial</a> it attacked the BBC\u2019s decision to broadcast \u201cno fewer than 10 radio programmes on the massacre\u201d, and disputed the framing of a Radio 4 documentary (presented by Katharine Viner, editor-in-chief of the Guardian), which was entitled <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m00076th\" title=\"\">Peterloo: </a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m00076th\" title=\"\">The Massacre That Changed Britain</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7dce2aad065f788dde36e82f8d5a7dd6b475697a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7dce2aad065f788dde36e82f8d5a7dd6b475697a/0_208_5079_3047/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A scene from Mike Leigh\u2019s Peterloo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A scene from Mike Leigh\u2019s Peterloo.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Mein</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The editorial declared that \u201ccontrary to the BBC\u2019s demonology\u201d, Peterloo had \u201cno wider historical significance, and did not \u2018change Britain\u2019 beyond feeding a tendentious account by leftwing historians of Britain\u2019s traditions of radical protest\u201d.

Daniel Finkelstein, a Tory peer and former executive editor of the Times, has echoed these sentiments, <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-left-wants-peterloo-to-matter-more-than-it-did-hsdj5rqcz\" title=\"\">declaring in a column</a> that \u201ca romantic desire to suggest that Britain\u2019s path was decided by street protest and a contemporary hint that it might work again can\u2019t be allowed to make Peterloo bear more weight than it can carry\u201d. </p> \n<p>The Times\u2019 leader concludes with the claim that using the past \u201cas a prism through which to interpret current politics is bad history\u201d. Ironic, then, that these articles themselves use Peterloo to condemn the exercise of \u201cstreet protest\u201d in the present day.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s not hard to see why Conservatives in this country are worried about the effect the bicentenary of Peterloo might have on contemporary politics.

Daniel Finkelstein, a Tory peer and former executive editor of the Times, has echoed these sentiments, declaring in a column that \u201ca romantic desire to suggest that Britain\u2019s path was decided by street protest and a contemporary hint that it might work again can\u2019t be allowed to make Peterloo bear more weight than it can carry\u201d. The Times\u2019 leader concludes with the claim that using the past \u201cas a prism through which to interpret current politics is bad history\u201d. Ironic, then, that these articles themselves use Peterloo to condemn the exercise of \u201cstreet protest\u201d in the present day. It\u2019s not hard to see why Conservatives in this country are worried about the effect the bicentenary of Peterloo might have on contemporary politics. We\u2019re only a few weeks away from what\u2019s looking increasingly like a no-deal Brexit, with warnings multiplying about social unrest, street violence and public disorder, and troops apparently being put on alert to deal with food riots and political marches. The establishment\u2019s anxiety is palpable. There are echoes here of the fears of \u201cthe mob\u201d felt by the magistrates in 1819 and their masters in the Tory government. It was repeated a century later in a similar massacre whose anniversary we are also marking this year, at Jallianwala Bagh in the Indian city of Amritsar \u2013 where a peaceful meeting was being held to protest against the detention and deportation of two Indian nationalist politicians. More than 400 unarmed protesters were shot down by British troops commanded by an army officer who later said his purpose was \u201cto punish the Indians\u201d for their effrontery. Just as the Amritsar massacre proved a turning point in the struggle for Indian independence, so Peterloo proved a turning point in the fight for the right to demonstrate. This had nothing to do with violent revolution and everything to do with peaceful reform. Thompson was not creating any \u201cMarxist\u201d political narrative when he concluded that \u201csince the moral consensus of the nation outlawed the riding down and sabreing of an unarmed crowd, the corollary followed \u2013 that the right of public meeting had been gained\u201d. Beyond this, national horror at the massacre provided a real impulse for the campaign to extend the right to vote, gained after a further series of mass demonstrations and public meetings just over a decade later, in 1832. The crowds at Peterloo were ultimately placing their faith in the power of parliament to represent the people once its archaic constitution had been amended. That power needs defending more than ever now, at a time when it is threatened by an unelected prime minister who shows every sign of wanting to push through an unpopular and immensely damaging policy without its consent. \u2022 Richard J Evans is provost of Gresham College, London, and author of The Pursuit of Power: Europe 1815-1914, published by Penguin",

He went on to co-found the <a href=\"https://cis.org/Environmental-Argument-Reducing-Immigration-United-States\">Center for Immigration Studies</a>. Tanton, who warned of a <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2015/witan-memo-iii\">\u201cLatin onslaught\u201d</a> that would degrade America\u2019s culture and lands, is widely regarded as the founder of the modern immigration reform movement.</p> <p>While Tanton was establishing his right-leaning network of anti-immigration organizations, new ecologists on the left were coming to the same conclusions he did about the answer to growing environmental crisis.<strong> </strong>\u201cDeep ecologists\u201d in the 1980s and 1990s argued that humans were just one of many species, and often an invasive and destructive one.

The Sierra Club had grown exponentially in the preceding decades, and \u201cpopulation control\u201d had been part of its core platform. A nearly decade-long <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1997-sep-29-mn-37456-story.html\">power struggle</a> ensued for control over America\u2019s pre-eminent conservation group, as new members attempted to move away from the overpopulation argument, while longtime Sierrans and those in Tanton\u2019s circle <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/news/2004/01/14/dees-runs-sierra-club-board\">pushed the group</a> to maintain immigration control as a core tenet.</p> <p>They ultimately lost the Sierra Club in the mid-2000s, but anti-immigration groups <a href=\"https://prospect.org/article/guilt-association\">associated with Tanton</a> didn\u2019t give up on attempting to influence eco-minded progressives.

That\u2019s the argument that a lot of anti-immigrant environmentalists have made,\u201d said Hultgren <strong>\u2013 </strong>but taken to a violent end.</p> <p>Limiting immigration has certainly proven more politically palatable than regulating fossil fuel companies and corporate polluters under the current administration.</p> <p>Tanton network groups have reportedly enjoyed a close relationship with the Trump administration and a great deal of influence over immigration policy. Trump\u2019s adviser Stephen Miller and former attorney general Jeff Sessions have both been linked to Tanton groups.

Long before he became the father of the Proud Boys, the Vice magazine co-founder Gavin McInnes espoused the ecological virtues of population and immigration control.

      "bodyText": "The environmentalist, white nationalist, and influential anti-immigration activist John Tanton died less than three weeks before the El Paso shooting. Tanton lived to see his movement shape much of modern US immigration policy, but not this latest violent turn. A hate-filled document allegedly linked to the man suspected of killing 22 people in El Paso on 3 August echoed the kind of rhetoric generally favored by the far right \u2013 and also had a decidedly environmentalist, Tanton-like bent. The document praised the Dr Seuss character the Lorax, who says he speaks for the trees, and complained about the unsustainable overuse of paper towels. It concluded that the best course of environmental action would be mass murder. A week prior, on an Instagram account reportedly linked to the alleged Gilroy, California, garlic festival shooter, he complained about migrant-driven sprawl. Months before, the Christchurch, New Zealand, shooter called himself an \u201ceco-fascist\u201d. Long before this violence, researchers warned of \u201cthe greening of hate\u201d. From Tanton\u2019s anti-immigration nonprofit network to some of today\u2019s avowed environmentalists, across the political spectrum, overpopulation and immigration in particular has been blamed for environmental collapse for over 50 years. Anti-immigrant ideology has been part and parcel of the whole of American conservationism since the first national park was founded, in part to protect wild yet white-owned nature from Mexicans and Native Americans. National purity and natural purity were inextricably linked. The current rise of eco-minded white supremacy follows a direct line from the powerful attorney, conservationist and eugenicist Madison Grant \u2013 a friend of trees, Teddy Roosevelt, and the colonial superiority of white land stewardship. Grant, along with the influential naturalist John Muir and other early Anglo-Saxon conservationists, was critical in preserving the country\u2019s wildlands for white enjoyment. Muir, who founded the Sierra Club environmental group in 1892, was disturbed by the \u201cuncleanliness\u201d of the Native Americans, whom he wanted removed from Yosemite. Grant successfully lobbied, in equal measure, for the creation of protected national parks and the restriction of immigration by non-whites. \u201cEnvironmentalists were hardcore eugenicists. They were as committed to racial thinking as they were to protecting the great redwoods in California,\u201d said Heidi Beirich, intelligence project director at the Southern Poverty Law Center. That eco-xenophobia resurfaced in the 1970s as overpopulation and resource depletion was deemed the pre-eminent challenge facing the planet at the dawn of the anthropocene. Published in 1968, The Population Bomb, by the Stanford University biology professor Paul Ehrlich, predicted that overpopulation would fuel worldwide famine and global upheaval. Much of what Ehrlich predicted did not come to pass, but the book proved hugely influential in the nascent environmental movement. Global population growth was soon conflated with US immigration growth, and both were blamed for the coming collapse of Spaceship Earth. This argument inspired generations of eco-nativists, and the most influential anti-immigration advocacy network currently operating in the US. In 1979, Tanton, a local Sierra Club official, founded the \u201ccentrist/liberal\u201d Federation for American Immigration Reform (Fair) to further advance the overpopulation-as-environmental-degradation cause. He went on to co-found the Center for Immigration Studies. Tanton, who warned of a \u201cLatin onslaught\u201d that would degrade America\u2019s culture and lands, is widely regarded as the founder of the modern immigration reform movement. While Tanton was establishing his right-leaning network of anti-immigration organizations, new ecologists on the left were coming to the same conclusions he did about the answer to growing environmental crisis. \u201cDeep ecologists\u201d in the 1980s and 1990s argued that humans were just one of many species, and often an invasive and destructive one. Activist David Orton argued that limiting immigration \u201cfrom a maintenance of biodiversity perspective \u2026 has nothing to do with fascists\u201d. The deep ecologist Dave Foreman was a co-founder of the radical wilderness collective Earth First! before the group forced him and his increasingly anti-immigration ideology out. By the late 90s, the anti-immigration issue reached a fever pitch within the US environmental movement. The Sierra Club had grown exponentially in the preceding decades, and \u201cpopulation control\u201d had been part of its core platform. A nearly decade-long power struggle ensued for control over America\u2019s pre-eminent conservation group, as new members attempted to move away from the overpopulation argument, while longtime Sierrans and those in Tanton\u2019s circle pushed the group to maintain immigration control as a core tenet. They ultimately lost the Sierra Club in the mid-2000s, but anti-immigration groups associated with Tanton didn\u2019t give up on attempting to influence eco-minded progressives. They ran ads linking overpopulation and climate crisis in mainstream newspapers and progressive magazines, from the New York Times to the Nation. \u201cThe takeover attempts of the Sierra Club really woke people up to what was going on, but it still continues,\u201d said Betsy Hartmann, Hampshire College professor emerita of development studies and author of The America Syndrome: Apocalypse, War and Our Call to Greatness. \u201cThe fact that it\u2019s picked up \u2013 that\u2019s the new twist.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the far right really take up ecological arguments again,\u201d said John Hultgren, a Bennington College environmental politics professor and author of Border Walls Gone Green: Nature and Anti-immigrant Politics in America. \u201cThe rise of eco-fascism, I think, is very real.\u201d The right\u2019s perspective on the climate crisis has generally been one of denial, and reliance on a fringe in the scientific community that maintains climate change is a natural process. According to available research, immigration control as climate control is a similar pseudoscience. By stopping immigration from countries with low per capita emissions to wealthier nations with high per capita emissions, this thinking goes, total environmental impact will be limited, as will further damage to US wildlands and biodiversity: fewer people means less sprawl and less resource use. There is little actual science to bolster immigration control for ecological purposes. While there is evidence that population and economic growth in total increases global emissions, recent studies show no correlation between US immigrant communities and pollution. Whether eco-nativists are using these arguments to greenwash racism, or they truly believe limiting immigration is the best way to pull the planet back from the brink, the results are the same. \u201cYou can be a genuine environmentalist and a genuine xenophobe \u2013 the two often do converge,\u201d said Hultgren. The El Paso manifesto echoed this logic, lamenting that it\u2019s proven too difficult to change American consumers\u2019 habits. \u201cSo population reduction is almost the low-hanging fruit, the simple solution to the crisis of climate change. That\u2019s the argument that a lot of anti-immigrant environmentalists have made,\u201d said Hultgren \u2013 but taken to a violent end. Limiting immigration has certainly proven more politically palatable than regulating fossil fuel companies and corporate polluters under the current administration. Tanton network groups have reportedly enjoyed a close relationship with the Trump administration and a great deal of influence over immigration policy. Trump\u2019s adviser Stephen Miller and former attorney general Jeff Sessions have both been linked to Tanton groups. Former Fair officials and lobbyists have found a new home in the Trump administration. They include the former executive director of Fair, who is now the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s citizenship and immigration services ombudsman. The eco-xenophobic rhetoric that Tanton and his supporters have traded in has proliferated across the right, straddling both arguments about population growth and outright racist beliefs that Latino immigrants, in particular, destroy nature. Long before he became the father of the Proud Boys, the Vice magazine co-founder Gavin McInnes espoused the ecological virtues of population and immigration control. In a 2003 Vice Guide to Happiness, McInnes offered some cause for optimism under President George W Bush: \u201cImmigration is getting handled, which is helping the environmental problems overpopulation has caused.\u201d In 2010, he grumbled about how the Sierra Club had turned away from the anti-immigration cause. Richard Spencer\u2019s \u201cmeta-political manifesto for the Alt-Right\u201d advocated for a kind of conservationism in the white nationalist tradition. The rightwing pundit Ann Coulter claimed Americans will have to choose between a \u201cgreening or browning\u201d of America. The Fox News host Tucker Carlson opined on air about the ecological impact of immigrants: \u201cI actually hate litter, which is one of the reasons I\u2019m so against illegal immigration.\u201d Online, an eco-fascist rhetorical revival has been wrapped in traditional white nationalist imagery and language, along with love for large guns. Using the hashtag #pinetreegang, supporters espouse the benefits of immigration control and share Lorax memes: just like Madison Grant and John Tanton before them, they purport to speak for the trees. \u201cWhat\u2019s on the rise is white supremacy in general, but this is a pretty staple part of that ideology,\u201d said Beirich. \u201cWhen people hear [the Nazi nationalist slogan] \u2018blood and soil\u2019, they think of the blood, but the soil part mattered.\u201d One of the favored Pine Tree Gang phrases: \u201cBees, not refugees.\u201d The Sierra Club has backed far away from its xenophobic history, as have other environmental groups, which have since taken a more global perspective on climate crisis and environmental justice. \u201cIt\u2019s only now that the environmental movement is less racist than it\u2019s ever been,\u201d said Beirich. \u201cEnvironmental justice activists forced American environmentalists, most of whom were white and middle and upper class, to really confront this logic,\u201d said Hultgren. \u201cThere\u2019s been an ideological shift among mainstream and progressive environmental organizations to really reflect on the relationship between social inequality and environmental degradation.\u201d In 2013, the Sierra Club and the environmental activist group 350.org threw their support behind immigration. Earth First! has gone a step further, calling national borders \u201cscar[s] on the earth\u201d. \u201cThe entire earth is a closed system, and the idea that people crossing borders is going to have a major impact on any individual environment is absurd,\u201d said Veery Marten, an Earth First! Journal collective member. \u201cThe culprits of this white supremacist violence citing alleged environmental interests are almost always middle class white men who are not lowering their own carbon footprint. It\u2019s not really about consumption, it\u2019s about who\u2019s allowed to consume and gate-keeping these resources.\u201d Environmental activism is still far from fully making amends for its history, though, and indigenous groups and people of color still feel sidelined in the movement. \u201cThe environmental movement is increasingly reconciling with what it means to try to protect land on this continent when this land is stolen,\u201d said Marten. Mainstream environmentalists and the broader left may no longer espouse the benefits of limiting immigration, but many do warn of an impending global refugee crisis worsened by climate change that will in turn pressure societies unable or unwilling to grapple with an influx of new residents. In 2018, a World Bank report predicted more than 140 million climate migrants from Latin America, sub-saharan Africa and south-east Asia could be displaced by 2050. Concern for these migrants is often couched in calls for more open borders. But Hartmann warns that proclamations of looming dystopia in the form of a mass climate-caused global refugee crisis put well-intentioned environmentalists on some shared ground with fear-mongering nativists, even as they\u2019re attempting to convey a useful urgency about the future of the planet and the disproportionate impacts of climate crisis on the developing world. \u201cNot to say there won\u2019t be climate-related migration, but I think that portrayal of migrants as climate change refugees, especially these mass movements of people, feeds into the anti-immigrant environmental worldview,\u201d said Hartmann. \u201cAlarmist hyperbole and stereotypes around climate conflict and even climate mass refugee dislocation is based on kind of old, racially and colonially charged stereotypes of poor people of color being more prone to violence in times of scarcity.\u201d A worsening climate crisis could easily become a cudgel for anti-immigration activists looking to use ecological preservation as an excuse to close borders, a means of gesturing toward doing something about climate crisis that aligns with the right\u2019s other political goals. \u201cAs it becomes more difficult for Republicans to deny that climate change is a thing, this is a really likely next move for the right in climate politics,\u201d said Hultgren.",

Later in the summer, neighbors began calling police to report the disappearance of the local \u201ccurmudgeon\u201d who normally walked his dog daily and tenderly cared for the neighborhood\u2019s plants. They reported seeing multiple people, who appeared to be homeless, coming and going from his house.</p> <p>Neighbors became increasingly concerned in August when they spotted an unknown man in the house washing down floors with so much soapy water that gushes flowed out under the door and into the street, smelling strongly of bleach.</p> <p>The next day, when a white van pulled up, marked as a biohazard crime scene cleanup vehicle from a company called Aftermath Services, the neighbors decided it was \u201cjust too surreal\u201d and dialed 911 to get police, said Free. They reported that a strange man stood outside the home to meet the van.</p> <p>\u201cWe said: \u2018Get over there now; there\u2019s something really fishy happening,\u2019\u201d Free told the Guardian last year.</p> <p>Police discovered Egg\u2019s badly decomposed torso in a fish tank hidden in small room with its door concealed behind a picture. The body was submerged in chemicals and held down by a carpet, empty bottles of Drano and an iron sawhorse, according to an autopsy report obtained by <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/crime/article/Headless-body-found-in-SF-fish-tank-ruled-a-13829458.php\">the San Francisco Chronicle</a>. The report also confirmed Egg\u2019s remains through DNA analysis and determined he had been murdered by blunt force.</p> <p>\u201cWhen examined, it appeared that the subject was decapitated and both hands were not with the remains,\u201d the medical examiners\u2019 office wrote, according to the Chronicle. \u201cThe subject\u2019s legs also appeared severed, but the feet were found in the fish tank inside socks. ... As the subject was being manipulated and pulled out of the tank, apparent biological tissue was dislodging from the bones.\u201d</p> <p>In the days after discovering the remains, police arrested Silva and another man, both of whom neighbors said had been seen at the home, on charges of homicide, fraud, theft, identity theft and elder abuse. But the charges were never formally filed in court and Silva was held on parole violation in another, unrelated case until April of this year, when he was released.</p> <p>The second arrestee, 52-year-old Robert McCaffrey, allegedly the man who met the crime scene cleanup crew, was released shortly after his arrest in August 2018.

      "bodyText": "Brian Egg\u2019s head and hands are still missing. And a year after the dismembered body of the San Francisco man was found stuffed into a chemical-filled fish tank in his home, his killer remains at large. On the anniversary of the discovery of one of the city\u2019s grisliest unsolved murders, neighbors of the former bartender are calling on police to explain why authorities freed the only known suspects in the case, who were arrested for allegedly using Egg\u2019s credit cards to hire a crime scene cleanup service to sanitize the murder scene. Police say they are still trying to build enough evidence to bring charges in the case. \u201cThe murderer is free and roaming the streets and can claim his next victim,\u201d said Scot Free, who was one of several neighbors who repeatedly called police to report Egg missing from his home in the city\u2019s SoMa neighborhood last summer, then complained that police didn\u2019t check his house and discover his body for weeks. \u201cI want a more thorough investigation. I want someone arrested,\u201d said Free. He\u2019s not alone in expressing frustration with the lack of information and progress on the case. \u201cThis is really shocking,\u201d Matt Haney, a San Francisco supervisor, wrote on Facebook after learning from the Bay Area Reporter, a local LGBT newspaper, that one suspect had been let free in April. \u201cA couple of guys were found in Brian Egg\u2019s house, after hiring a cleaning crew, and using his credit cards. After a couple of checks on the house, they found his mutilated body in a fish tank. And yet now there is apparently no suspect in his death, no further information, and his family finds out through the media that the one suspect has been released,\u201d Haney wrote. \u201cThis is awful.\u201d Police said the suspect Michael Silva, 40, who was arrested last year after allegedly using Egg\u2019s credit cards to order a crime scene cleanup crew and to buy a used BMW, is still a \u201cperson of interest\u201d in the case, even though he was released. \u201cInvestigators need probable cause to make an arrest and they are working diligently to build a prosecutable case,\u201d said Sgt Michael Andraychak, in a statement. \u201cIt has been a long investigation with a number of leads to investigate. We are making headway and are confident that an arrest will be made.\u201d Egg, 65, a former bartender at a legendary San Francisco gay bar called The Stud, was last seen in his home in May 2018. Later in the summer, neighbors began calling police to report the disappearance of the local \u201ccurmudgeon\u201d who normally walked his dog daily and tenderly cared for the neighborhood\u2019s plants. They reported seeing multiple people, who appeared to be homeless, coming and going from his house. Neighbors became increasingly concerned in August when they spotted an unknown man in the house washing down floors with so much soapy water that gushes flowed out under the door and into the street, smelling strongly of bleach. The next day, when a white van pulled up, marked as a biohazard crime scene cleanup vehicle from a company called Aftermath Services, the neighbors decided it was \u201cjust too surreal\u201d and dialed 911 to get police, said Free. They reported that a strange man stood outside the home to meet the van. \u201cWe said: \u2018Get over there now; there\u2019s something really fishy happening,\u2019\u201d Free told the Guardian last year. Police discovered Egg\u2019s badly decomposed torso in a fish tank hidden in small room with its door concealed behind a picture. The body was submerged in chemicals and held down by a carpet, empty bottles of Drano and an iron sawhorse, according to an autopsy report obtained by the San Francisco Chronicle. The report also confirmed Egg\u2019s remains through DNA analysis and determined he had been murdered by blunt force. \u201cWhen examined, it appeared that the subject was decapitated and both hands were not with the remains,\u201d the medical examiners\u2019 office wrote, according to the Chronicle. \u201cThe subject\u2019s legs also appeared severed, but the feet were found in the fish tank inside socks. ... As the subject was being manipulated and pulled out of the tank, apparent biological tissue was dislodging from the bones.\u201d In the days after discovering the remains, police arrested Silva and another man, both of whom neighbors said had been seen at the home, on charges of homicide, fraud, theft, identity theft and elder abuse. But the charges were never formally filed in court and Silva was held on parole violation in another, unrelated case until April of this year, when he was released. The second arrestee, 52-year-old Robert McCaffrey, allegedly the man who met the crime scene cleanup crew, was released shortly after his arrest in August 2018. Free says he now sees McCaffrey wandering around the neighborhood. Egg\u2019s brother, Devon Egg, told the Bay Area Reporter in April that he was not told of Silva\u2019s release. \u201cI am very angry about this. I got no notice.\u201d But he added that he forgave police for any mistakes in the case. The San Francisco district attorney\u2019s office said police have not yet filed enough case information to allow charges to be filed against the suspects. \u201cOnce a case is presented to us we\u2019ll have the opportunity to make a charging decision,\u201d said DA\u2019s office spokesman Max Szabo in a statement. Police have faced criticism for failing to act more quickly on neighbors\u2019 complaints of suspicious activity. They visited the home several times in the weeks before discovering the body, but never went inside. Egg\u2019s neighborhood is at the center of a rapidly transforming San Francisco. Once a bastion of the 1970s gay rights movement, the area is now home to high-end condo developments and booming real estate prices. Simultaneously, it has become a refuge for the city\u2019s surging homeless population. Egg bought his home for $19,000 in 1976. In May, his estate sold the home for $1.5m, according to Zillow. Yet this week neighbors said squatters were setting up in tents in front of the home. Neighbors said Egg often ate at the local homeless meal program and sometimes offered people he met there a place to stay. \u201cWe all miss him,\u201d said Free, who was one of many neighbors who organized a vigil after Egg\u2019s death. \u201cHe was entertaining to talk to. He was sort of an eccentric, but he had a kind heart.\u201d Free fears the current situation is unlikely to change. \u201cThe silence has been deafening in this case.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>In this age of TV spots, teasers and teaser announcements, the thought of dedicating three entire minutes to an old-fashioned movie trailer is unheard of. And yet that\u2019s exactly what we got from Emma Thompson and Paul Feig\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/14/last-christmas-first-trailer-for-emma-thompson-romcom-featuring-the-music-of-george-michael\">new rom-com Last Christmas</a> this week.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/14/last-christmas-first-trailer-for-emma-thompson-romcom-featuring-the-music-of-george-michael\">Last Christmas: first trailer for Emma Thompson romcom featuring the music of George Michael</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The Last Christmas trailer told us every single thing we needed to know about the film. It introduced us to the walking disaster zone that is Emilia Clarke\u2019s lead character, who works in a year-round Christmas shop. We see her meet-cute with Henry Golding when a bird defecates into one of her eyes. We hear how she had recently become very ill and almost died. We watch as Henry Golding\u2019s influence begins to rub off on Emilia Clarke, opening her up to the magic of Christmas. We see them break in, and get chased out of, some sort of vintage hipster ice rink. We see it all; everything that Last Christmas has to offer.</p> \n<p>Except for the fact that Henry Golding is a ghost.</p> \n<p>Because, come on, he\u2019s definitely a ghost. Or maybe an angel. Definitely. One of those two things is definitely true.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3f0d8502-981a-4e7b-839e-b0d7a6a9cb54\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6nMh2_gTrAg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>I\u2019m not the only one who thinks so. Dozens and dozens of people saw the Last Christmas trailer this week, and they saw how completely generic it was, and they couldn\u2019t quite square the sheer blandness of the film with the big names involved. And so they realised that the trailer must have been hiding some sort of super unspoken twist in plain sight, and as one they all decided that Henry Golding was a ghost.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf Henry Golding is actually a sexy festive ghost, we will be DECEASED\u201d tweeted <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hellogiggles/status/1162049072510984193\">Hellogiggles</a>. \u201cSo... Henry Golding was a ghost all along, yes? Or perhaps it is a dream Kate has while still in the hospital?\u201d tweeted <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bexlewis361/status/1161555211237908480\">Rebecca Lewis</a>. \u2018So Is Henry Golding a Ghost in Emilia Clarke\u2019s First Post-Game of Thrones Movie, or What?\u2019 shouted <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/so-is-henry-golding-a-ghost-in-emilia-clarkes-first-pos-1837245629\">Gizmodo</a>.</p> \n<p>The theory has caught on like wildfire, to the point that if Henry Golding actually plays a nice, normal, real-life character in Last Christmas, I genuinely fear that there will be riots.</p> \n<p>Still, it makes sense. Throughout the duration of the trailer, Henry Golding wears exactly the same outfit and never interacts with anyone but Emilia Clarke. He sneaks up on her (like a ghost would) and is prone to saying irrefutably ghost-like things, like when he tells her that their meeting wasn\u2019t accidental, and when he says \u201cIt was always going to be you\u201d. There\u2019s also a clip of him saying \u201cBeing a human is hard\u201d, which I\u2019m taking to mean that he thinks humans are literally hard, like corporeal, like hard compared to a ghost, because humans can\u2019t walk through the walls that he definitely can because he\u2019s a ghost.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aaba3ce9bdff2f6eab2b6561b450d9d969a404aa\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aaba3ce9bdff2f6eab2b6561b450d9d969a404aa/0_0_660_396/500.jpg\" alt=\"The theory that Henry Golding plays a ghost in the upcoming Last Christmas has caught on like wildfire.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The theory that Henry Golding plays a ghost in the upcoming Last Christmas has caught on like wildfire.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But wait! The theory thickens. Last Christmas features the music of George Michael, remember? It\u2019s named Last Christmas after the Wham! song Last Christmas. And how does the song go? That\u2019s right: \u201cLast Christmas, I gave you my heart\u201d.</p> \n<p>Do you know what this means? It means that Henry Golding plays a man who died in a terrible accident, and he was a registered organ donor, and when Emilia Clarke was ill last Christmas she became the recipient of his heart. He literally gave her his heart, and now his spirit has become her moral guide. This is a rom-com where a woman falls in love with the ghost of a man who was mangled to death in some sort of horrific industrial accident. That has to be it, right?</p> \n<p>BUT WAIT! What if that isn\u2019t it either? Because how does the rest of Last Christmas\u2019 chorus go? That\u2019s right: \u201cThis year, to save me from tears, I\u2019ll give it to someone special\u201d. This leads me to believe that, so far, all the Last Christmas theorists have only seen half the picture.</p> \n<p>Because what if <em>that\u2019s</em> the plot of the film? What if Henry Golding really did die, and his heart really was implanted into the body of Emilia Clarke, but he\u2019s become dissatisfied with her attitude towards life, and so is lulling her into a false sense of security so that <em>he can snatch his heart back right out of her body</em>, and give it to a more deserving participant? What if that\u2019s the film? If it\u2019s a horror movie about a bloodthirsty and vengeful ghost attempting to tear the beating heart out of a woman from beyond the grave? I\u2019ve nailed it, haven\u2019t I? This is exactly what Last Christmas is.</p> \n<p>Or, you know, it\u2019s just a rubbishy-looking rom-com. One or the other.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In this age of TV spots, teasers and teaser announcements, the thought of dedicating three entire minutes to an old-fashioned movie trailer is unheard of. And yet that\u2019s exactly what we got from Emma Thompson and Paul Feig\u2019s new rom-com Last Christmas this week. The Last Christmas trailer told us every single thing we needed to know about the film. It introduced us to the walking disaster zone that is Emilia Clarke\u2019s lead character, who works in a year-round Christmas shop. We see her meet-cute with Henry Golding when a bird defecates into one of her eyes. We hear how she had recently become very ill and almost died. We watch as Henry Golding\u2019s influence begins to rub off on Emilia Clarke, opening her up to the magic of Christmas. We see them break in, and get chased out of, some sort of vintage hipster ice rink. We see it all; everything that Last Christmas has to offer. Except for the fact that Henry Golding is a ghost. Because, come on, he\u2019s definitely a ghost. Or maybe an angel. Definitely. One of those two things is definitely true. I\u2019m not the only one who thinks so. Dozens and dozens of people saw the Last Christmas trailer this week, and they saw how completely generic it was, and they couldn\u2019t quite square the sheer blandness of the film with the big names involved. And so they realised that the trailer must have been hiding some sort of super unspoken twist in plain sight, and as one they all decided that Henry Golding was a ghost. \u201cIf Henry Golding is actually a sexy festive ghost, we will be DECEASED\u201d tweeted Hellogiggles. \u201cSo... Henry Golding was a ghost all along, yes? Or perhaps it is a dream Kate has while still in the hospital?\u201d tweeted Rebecca Lewis. \u2018So Is Henry Golding a Ghost in Emilia Clarke\u2019s First Post-Game of Thrones Movie, or What?\u2019 shouted Gizmodo. The theory has caught on like wildfire, to the point that if Henry Golding actually plays a nice, normal, real-life character in Last Christmas, I genuinely fear that there will be riots. Still, it makes sense. Throughout the duration of the trailer, Henry Golding wears exactly the same outfit and never interacts with anyone but Emilia Clarke. He sneaks up on her (like a ghost would) and is prone to saying irrefutably ghost-like things, like when he tells her that their meeting wasn\u2019t accidental, and when he says \u201cIt was always going to be you\u201d. There\u2019s also a clip of him saying \u201cBeing a human is hard\u201d, which I\u2019m taking to mean that he thinks humans are literally hard, like corporeal, like hard compared to a ghost, because humans can\u2019t walk through the walls that he definitely can because he\u2019s a ghost. But wait! The theory thickens. Last Christmas features the music of George Michael, remember? It\u2019s named Last Christmas after the Wham! song Last Christmas. And how does the song go? That\u2019s right: \u201cLast Christmas, I gave you my heart\u201d. Do you know what this means? It means that Henry Golding plays a man who died in a terrible accident, and he was a registered organ donor, and when Emilia Clarke was ill last Christmas she became the recipient of his heart. He literally gave her his heart, and now his spirit has become her moral guide. This is a rom-com where a woman falls in love with the ghost of a man who was mangled to death in some sort of horrific industrial accident. That has to be it, right? BUT WAIT! What if that isn\u2019t it either? Because how does the rest of Last Christmas\u2019 chorus go? That\u2019s right: \u201cThis year, to save me from tears, I\u2019ll give it to someone special\u201d. This leads me to believe that, so far, all the Last Christmas theorists have only seen half the picture. Because what if that\u2019s the plot of the film? What if Henry Golding really did die, and his heart really was implanted into the body of Emilia Clarke, but he\u2019s become dissatisfied with her attitude towards life, and so is lulling her into a false sense of security so that he can snatch his heart back right out of her body, and give it to a more deserving participant? What if that\u2019s the film? If it\u2019s a horror movie about a bloodthirsty and vengeful ghost attempting to tear the beating heart out of a woman from beyond the grave? I\u2019ve nailed it, haven\u2019t I? This is exactly what Last Christmas is. Or, you know, it\u2019s just a rubbishy-looking rom-com. One or the other.",

      "bodyText": "US president Donald Trump has said he is \u201cconcerned\u201d about the risk of a violent Chinese crackdown in Hong Kong, as the city prepared for another weekend of protests. Chinese authorities have stepped up rhetoric against protesters in recent days, likening them to terrorists and threatening to use force to end the demonstrations. Large numbers of paramilitary forces have also been moved to the nearby border city of Shenzhen, where they are drilling in a stadium. Trump said he would urge his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to sit down with protesters, but admitted that was unlikely. \u201cI know it\u2019s not the kind of thing he does,\u201d he told reporters en route to a campaign rally. Trump had previously described the demonstrations as \u201criots\u201d that China would need to handle internally. The popular uprising, initially sparked by a controversial extradition law, has plunged Hong Kong into its worst crisis since the handover from British colonial rule in 1997, with escalating violence on both sides. Over 700 people have been arrested since the protests began. Many have been injured as police stepped up use of non-lethal weapons, including teargas, rubber bullets and beanbags. A young woman who was hit in the face may lose an eye. Amnesty International has condemned the police tactics, but protesters also apologised after attacking and tying up two men suspected of being Chinese spies, during a demonstration that shut down the airport for several hours. Further unrest was expected over the weekend, after police refused permission for several protests. A rally scheduled for Friday night called \u201cStand with Hong Kong, Power to the People\u201d will go ahead. But the Civil Human Rights Front, which organised a 2 million-strong march in June, was denied permission to hold another through central Hong Kong on Sunday, and told it can only rally in a park. The personal authority of Xi, a strongman who has centralised power and extended his mandate indefinitely, is at stake. The protests come at a particularly sensitive time, with the 70th anniversary of the founding of the communist-ruled People\u2019s Republic of China in October; Beijing does not want nationwide celebrations planned for that day overshadowed. The political, cultural and economic clout of the Chinese government has been on display as the showdown intensified, with major companies and celebrities coming to the defence of Hong Kong police and authorities. The resignation of Cathy Pacific CEO Rupert Hogg, effective immediately, came after mounting scrutiny from both Chinese regulators and mainland residents of the role of airline employees in the protest. The company, 30% owned by Air China, has already fired two pilots for taking part in \u2018\u201cillegal\u201d demonstrations and warned others could lose their position if they take part in any \u201cillegal activities\u201d. \u201cThere is no doubt that our brand and reputation are under immense pressure and this pressure has been growing for some weeks, particularly in the all-important market of mainland China,\u201d Hogg said in an email to all employees on Friday. Positive displays of support for the Hong Kong authorities came from major international firms based there, including Swire and conglomerate Jardine Matheson, which put out a statement saying backed police in \u201cefforts to restore law and order\u201d. Martial arts icon Jackie Chan also sided with authorities, describing the demonstrations as \u201csad and depressing\u201d, the South China Morning Post reported. He also claimed he had not heard about June\u2019s 2 million-strong peaceful march. Chinese-American actress Liu Yifei, who stars in the upcoming live-action remake of Disney\u2019s Mulan, also put out a message on the Chinese social media platform Weibo, saying, \u201cI also support the Hong Kong police,\u201d and sharing a pro-Beijing image.

      "bodyText": "An Australian-owned multinational is at the centre of a mysterious $15m shipment from Iran that threatens to breach strict US sanctions, the Guardian can reveal. Shipping records, leaked video and internal documents show the movement of a significant haul of urea fertiliser out of Iran last month, through the Middle East and on to China. The shipment was then reloaded onto a cargo ship being used by Quantum Fertiliser, a Hong Kong-based trading subsidiary of the ASX-listed multinational Incitec Pivot, a one-time contractor with the federal government and donor to the Labor party. The company said it was \u201cmisled about the origin of the product\u201d and was urgently offloading the suspect cargo, while launching a wider review to \u201cremove the risk of a repeat of this situation\u201d. Strict United States sanctions prohibiting business dealings with Iran, including by non-US entities, were revived last year, following the Trump administration\u2019s abandonment of the Iran nuclear deal. The far-reaching sanctions have prompted fears over even the most benign business interactions with Iran. Last month, two vessels carrying Iranian fertiliser to Brazil were left stranded for a month because the state-owned oil company Petrobras refused to refuel them for the return journey, fearing US retribution. Internal documents suggest Quantum knew the goods it was loading had just come from a cargo vessel named the CS Future. The Guardian has separately established that the CS Future left Iran\u2019s Bandar Abbas port on 1 July. Vessel inspection reports show it was carrying \u201curea in bulk\u201d. Publicly-available online vessel trackers also show the CS Future had just travelled through the Middle East. The vessel arrived at Lianyungang, China, on 25 July, via Oman, and began unloading its cargo, valued at an estimated $10-$15m. The haul was then reloaded onto a second cargo ship, the Bulk Aquila. An email sent to Quantum employees detailed the process. \u201cAs per the agent all the cargo for the subject vessel is from another ship MV CS Future (she is also at Lianyungang discharging at the moment, up to the morning 12000MT were unloaded),\u201d the email reads. \u201cIn order to speed up the cargo transit process (from MV CS Future to MV Bulk Aquila), kindly ask your supplier to ensure a continuous and sufficient truck flow, also deploy enough shore cranes for loading.\u201d Leaked video from the Lianyungang port shows the CS Future being unloaded, the fertiliser in transit and the Bulk Aquila being loaded. The Bulk Aquila has since departed Lianyungang for another Chinese port. Incitec Pivot responded to questions by providing a statement from Quantum, its trading subsidiary. Quantum said it was assured by its Chinese supplier that it was buying products of Chinese origin. It had since rejected the cargo and alerted authorities. \u201cQuantum was supplied with formal documentation which purported to verify the source of this products, but on checking this documentation Quantum was not satisfied as to the origin of this product,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cQuantum took immediate action to reject the product and require that it be offloaded, and replaced with Chinese product. Quantum was misled about the origin of the product.\u201d The spokesman said the contract with Quantum\u2019s Chinese supplier stipulated the product must be of Chinese origin. The contract contained the company\u2019s \u201ccustomary stringent sanctions provisions\u201d, the spokesman said. He said Quantum began to question the origin of the cargo while it was being loaded in Lianyungang. \u201cTo ensure full compliance with international trading requirements, Quantum has engaged with the relevant authorities to notify them that it has rejected a cargo of urea from China, on the basis that Quantum was not satisfied as to the origin of the product,\u201d the spokesman said. Quantum said on Friday the Bulk Aquila was at the second Chinese port, Yantai, unloading the cargo under the watch of independent inspectors. It said the ship travelled to Yantai at the direction of its Chinese supplier to make use of the port\u2019s available storage. The movement of urea fertiliser between Iran and China is common. But the broad sanctions have placed international companies in precarious positions. Jarrett Blanc, a former US official who helped implement the Iran nuclear deal under the former president Barack Obama, said non-US entities now faced significant punishments for sanction breaches, depending on the circumstances. Blanc, while not speaking directly on the Quantum case, said companies could be frozen out of dealings with the US government, US businesses and other non-US companies that want to avoid being sanctioned themselves. \u201cThere are lots of enforcement possibilities depending on the specifics,\u201d Blanc told Guardian Australia. \u201cGenerally, if the transaction has no link to a US person, the non-US actors can be threatened with \u2018secondary sanctions\u2019 \u2013 essentially, they can become a US sanctions target themselves.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Amin Saikal, the director of the Australian National University\u2019s centre for Arab and Islamic studies, said the US sanctions were far-reaching and \u201cprohibit any foreign company to do business with Iran\u201d. \u201cIf a company trades with Iran, it would be liable to American penalty, especially if that company also has business dealings with the United States,\u201d Saikal said. Incitec has a clear sanctions policy that \u201cstrictly prohibits\u201d involvement in any transaction contravening sanctions. The policy states Incitec will not work with any third party that breaches or seeks to subvert sanctions. The policy applies to subsidiaries that trade on its behalf. \u201cThe policy provides that there must be appropriate due diligence in relation to third parties, transactions or activities that present a potential risk in relation to Sanctions Laws compliance. The policy sets out a process for conducting due diligence. \u201cThe policy applies to all directors, officers and employees of Incitec Pivot and each subsidiary, partnership, venture and business association, including distributors and agents and other contractors that are effectively controlled by Incitec Pivot or act on its behalf (either directly or indirectly).\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Whether for violence, public disorder or wage theft \u2013 there is no shortage of calls for more people to be sent to prison, and for longer.</p> <p>However, decades of research have shown that prison is the least effective place to rehabilitate offenders. Studies have indicated that a stint in prison <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0032885511415224?journalCode=tpjd\">increases the likelihood</a> that inmates will reoffend.</p> <p>There are many reasons for this: whether because they have been rendered incapable of functioning on the outside by the trauma of incarceration or because being housed with the country\u2019s worst-of-the-worst has rubbed off. Ultimately, prisons institutionalise inmates into a highly regulated way of life completely foreign to the real world.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/25/the-school-to-prison-pipeline-how-the-criminal-justice-system-fails-at-risk-kids\">The school-to-prison pipeline: how the criminal justice system fails at-risk kids | Sarah Hopkins</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Young people are particularly ill-suited to prison \u2013 detention renders them more likely to graduate from low-level juvenile offenders to lifetime criminals via a <a href=\"https://aic.gov.au/publications/tandi/tandi265\">stint in corrections</a>.</p> <p>Moreover, despite being seen as the ultimate \u201cstick\u201d to ensure social order, prison is <a href=\"https://www.sentencingcouncil.vic.gov.au/sites/default/files/publication-documents/Does%20Imprisonment%20Deter%20A%20Review%20of%20the%20Evidence.pdf\">not a deterrent</a> for most forms of offending. Crime is largely impulsive or driven by complex external factors on decision-making \u2013 the notion that offenders are \u201crational agents\u201d weighing up the cost and benefits of offending has been largely debunked.</p> <p>So, if prison doesn\u2019t work, what are the alternatives?</p> <p>Firstly, if people pose a risk to the community, they should be heavily monitored and controlled \u2013 but this can be done outside standard prison environments. Community corrections is already a part of Australia\u2019s criminal justice system and has been found to <a href=\"https://aic.gov.au/publications/rr/rr5\">effectively control and treat offending behaviour.</a></p> <p>Offenders regularly report back to a case manager, who is tasked with funnelling the offender through educational programs, community work and treatment programs designed to correct anti-social thinking and behaviour. Community corrections is no \u201csoft touch\u201d and the risk of imprisonment looms large over programs if an offender breaks the rules.</p> <p>Similar to community corrections but more therapeutic in nature are the various non-custodial treatment orders available for offenders whose offending relates to alcohol or illicit drug use or is connected to an underlying mental health condition.</p> <p>Drug courts have operated in Australia since 1999 and have been found to<a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0004865816673412\"> reduce recidivism</a> more effectively than conventional custodial sentences. The key to effective drug courts is the ability to make drug treatment orders, calling for the intensive treatment and monitoring of offenders with substance issues.</p> <p>Similarly, specialty jurisdictions exist for offenders with mental health issues.

      "bodyText": "Whether for violence, public disorder or wage theft \u2013 there is no shortage of calls for more people to be sent to prison, and for longer. However, decades of research have shown that prison is the least effective place to rehabilitate offenders. Studies have indicated that a stint in prison increases the likelihood that inmates will reoffend. There are many reasons for this: whether because they have been rendered incapable of functioning on the outside by the trauma of incarceration or because being housed with the country\u2019s worst-of-the-worst has rubbed off. Ultimately, prisons institutionalise inmates into a highly regulated way of life completely foreign to the real world. Young people are particularly ill-suited to prison \u2013 detention renders them more likely to graduate from low-level juvenile offenders to lifetime criminals via a stint in corrections. Moreover, despite being seen as the ultimate \u201cstick\u201d to ensure social order, prison is not a deterrent for most forms of offending. Crime is largely impulsive or driven by complex external factors on decision-making \u2013 the notion that offenders are \u201crational agents\u201d weighing up the cost and benefits of offending has been largely debunked. So, if prison doesn\u2019t work, what are the alternatives? Firstly, if people pose a risk to the community, they should be heavily monitored and controlled \u2013 but this can be done outside standard prison environments. Community corrections is already a part of Australia\u2019s criminal justice system and has been found to effectively control and treat offending behaviour. Offenders regularly report back to a case manager, who is tasked with funnelling the offender through educational programs, community work and treatment programs designed to correct anti-social thinking and behaviour. Community corrections is no \u201csoft touch\u201d and the risk of imprisonment looms large over programs if an offender breaks the rules. Similar to community corrections but more therapeutic in nature are the various non-custodial treatment orders available for offenders whose offending relates to alcohol or illicit drug use or is connected to an underlying mental health condition. Drug courts have operated in Australia since 1999 and have been found to reduce recidivism more effectively than conventional custodial sentences. The key to effective drug courts is the ability to make drug treatment orders, calling for the intensive treatment and monitoring of offenders with substance issues. Similarly, specialty jurisdictions exist for offenders with mental health issues. For example, the Assessment and Referral Court List in Victoria deals with accused persons who have a mental illness or cognitive impairment, lining them out with treatment agencies to deal with the underlying causes of offending. Not all forms of offending can be traced to underlying mental health issues, but for those offenders who do require treatment, it is the single most effective way to reduce reoffending. For other forms of offending, a financial penalty may be more effective than a prison sentence. For example, many forms of \u201cwhite-collar crime\u201d are motivated by pursuit of status. Public naming and shaming, hefty fines and bans on certain forms of professional practice are more likely to deter white-collar offending than prison. Moreover, victim-centred alternatives to standard prison sentences can provide empowerment for victims of crime. Restorative justice is a system of criminal justice that focuses on the rehabilitation of offenders through reconciliation with victims and the community at large. This can involve victims being able to confront their attackers, seek financial restitution and to have a say on the programs the offender must undertake. While not suitable for all forms of offending, restorative justice measures have been shown to provide healing outcomes for both victims and offenders. Finally, given our understanding of prison has a perverse mechanism to create more dangerous individuals, it\u2019s worth reassessing the scope of our current criminal law. There appears to be no reasonable justification why victimless crimes, from drug possession and use to sex work to \u201cpublic order\u201d crimes such as homelessness and public drunkenness, remain on the books. The potential for these offences to result in imprisonment is only going to result in a negative result for society as we turn harmless individuals into repeat \u2013 potentially violent \u2013 offenders. Ultimately, a shift in thinking away from imprisonment as a default solution for criminals can free up the public purse for more effective preventive measures. Justice reinvestment is a data-driven approach to improving the criminal justice system and reducing the expenditure incurred on it. It focuses on harnessing the cost savings of lower rates of imprisonment by reinvesting the funds into areas at risk of crime. The approach is evidence-based, following decades of research from public health, that a focus on prevention is often more cost-effective than focusing solely on a cure. It\u2019s time to rethink our approach to crime. While prison may seem like the obvious solution to anti-social behaviour, it is the least effective approach to making the community safer. \u2022 Jarryd Bartle is a writer and public policy consultant",

      "bodyText": "Disability royal commissioner and former state Liberal MP John Ryan has withdrawn from a \u201cmen\u2019s brekkie\u201d event at which he was to appear alongside NSW One Nation leader Mark Latham. The Crossing the Floor event is due to take place at St John\u2019s Anglican Church, Camden on 19 October, with Ryan and Latham the only two listed speakers. \u201cEnjoy a real man\u2019s brekkie and hear two local veterans of politics trading views and some laughs about current issues of interest to believers and doubters alike,\u201d the event description reads. While the event bills Ryan as \u201cformer state Liberal MP and royal commissioner\u201d, it does not include Latham\u2019s affiliation with One Nation but bills him as a \u201chigh profile state MP and former Labor leader\u201d. On Thursday, Guardian Australia approached the disability royal commission to ask if Ryan\u2019s attendance was appropriate given the event touts his former party affiliation and he was due to appear alongside Latham, who has made controversial public comments about disability. A spokesman for the disability royal commission told Guardian Australia: \u201cThe royal commission had no prior knowledge of commissioner Ryan\u2019s participation in the event. \u201cThe chair of the royal commission [Ronald Sackville] has asked commissioner Ryan to withdraw from the event and he has agreed to do so.\u201d In March 2017, Latham publicly criticised ABC Radio presenter Wendy Harmer, who he branded a \u201ccommercial failure\u201d, and added: \u201cNaturally she got a job at ABC radio at the sheltered workshop there for all the lefties. She fits the criteria: she\u2019s female, she\u2019s got a disability \u2013 that\u2019s what they mean by diversity.\u201d Harmer was born with a double cleft lip and palate. Latham was later dumped from Sky for calling a schoolchild gay for appearing in a video supporting feminism for International Women\u2019s Day. In March 2016 author and journalist Lisa Pryor settled a defamation case against the Australian Financial Review and Latham over a column in which he claimed feminists do not like children. On Friday the royal commission published guidance about how it will deal with perceived conflicts of interest, after Labor and the Greens called for Ryan and fellow commissioner Barbara Bennett to stand down over what Bill Shorten has called a \u201crecent, extensive and significant\u201d conflict. The guidance claims there is \u201cnothing unusual\u201d about managing perceived conflicts, which it described as \u201calmost inevitable\u201d if governments choose commissioners because of their experience in the area under investigation. Ryan, who was made a member of the Order of Australia in 2018 for significant service to the NSW parliament and to public administration, was a senior public servant for the NSW Department of Family and Community Services and was involved with the oversight of residential care programs for people with disability in NSW. Bennett was recently the deputy secretary of the families and communities branch of the Department of Social Services, and has been awarded a public service medal for outstanding public service. She also has a quadriplegic mother and a daughter with multiple sclerosis. The guidance states that \u201cno more than three or four commissioners will participate in any given public hearing\u201d and the chair will not authorise a commissioner to sit if that \u201cwould give rise to a reasonable perception of a conflict of interest or \u2026 apprehension of bias\u201d. \u201cA commissioner who does not participate in a particular public hearing will not participate in the preparation of any report produced as a direct result of that hearing.\u201d The Coalition has defended the appointment of Ryan and Bennett, arguing that any criticism of the validity of their appointment is \u201cwithout any foundation whatsoever\u201d. In 2015 trade union royal commissioner Dyson Heydon resisted calls to stand down after it was revealed he had agreed to speak at a Liberal fundraiser. Royal commissioners and judicial officers are deemed to have a perceived conflict if \u201ca fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that [they] might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question [they are] required to decide\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "It doesn\u2019t take long for a top reporter at the Australian, with a regular presence on page one, to become the target of a front-page story in the combative national broadsheet. It was just two months in the case of social affairs reporter Rick Morton \u2013 who resigned after publicly criticising the paper he had worked on for seven years. After exiting the Oz, Morton joined a growing line of ex-journalists critical of the way the increasingly rightwing paper operates. This week he was attacked by former colleagues on Twitter, as well as on the news and opinion pages. A feature Morton wrote for the Saturday Paper, headlined \u201cMurdoch media fuels far-right recruitment\u201d, was subjected to the blowtorch approach favoured by the Oz when attacking perceived enemies of Rupert Murdoch. The Australian\u2019s former deputy editor and now columnist Nick Cater called it a \u201cvile anti-Murdoch hate speech dog whistle\u201d on social media, referring to the reporter as \u201cBen Morton\u201d. Morton\u2019s sin was to report on an unpublished academic paper from Victoria University which, among other things, identified the sources of articles that were being shared most by far-right Facebook groups. \u201cThe soon-to-be-published research shows violent extremists latch on to and are \u2018emboldened\u2019 by news coverage and columns, which they see as adding credibility to their cause,\u201d Morton wrote. \u201cThe Australian, with an audience many orders of magnitude smaller [than the first three sources] and its content locked behind a hard paywall, is the fourth most shared content source among far-right groups in Australia.\u201d The Australian was quick to strike back, claiming in a front page \u201cexclusive\u201d that Victoria University had \u201crejected\u201d Morton\u2019s story and had denied that the research concluded \u201cNews publications fuelled far-right sentiment\u201d. It\u2019s true an explicit link between News publications and far-right sentiment is not made, and the research does not mention News Corp or Murdoch by name, but it does list the publications which are most shared \u2013 the Australian comes in fourth behind the Daily Mail, Nine digital and YouTube. Weekly Beast has obtained a copy of the research (which sadly for the Oz they could not get their hands on) and it may be even worse than the picture Morton painted. When all News outlets are added up they make up the largest source of content shared by the far-right groups on Facebook. News Corp, including Sky News and all the mastheads, makes up 7.2% of shared content, ahead of the Daily Mail on 7.1%, Nine digital on 6.6% and YouTube on 2.2%. As for the university rejecting the Saturday Paper\u2019s report, that is not clear-cut either. In a carefully worded statement in response to questions from the Oz, the uni confirmed that its research found that \u201cmainstream media content was used extensively by far-right groups\u201d. The lead researcher, Debra Smith, recommended Morton\u2019s \u201cpowerful\u201d article in a tweet on Saturday. Morton told Weekly Beast: \u201cI\u2019m genuinely glad the Australian has taken to the front page to distance itself from hate speech. I hope it continues.\u201d Mea culpa In an aside to the Saturday Paper saga, critics piled on to Morton on Twitter, pointing out that he wasn\u2019t a cleanskin when it came to writing articles which fuelled the far-right, including two on one of the Oz\u2019s targets, Yassmin Abdel-Magied, in 2017. Morton received a largely sympathetic hearing when he said he regretted writing the articles in question. Break from Breakfast After 11 years as ABC News Breakfast host, Virginia Trioli said goodbye on Friday to take up Jon Faine\u2019s breakfast shift on Melbourne radio. Trioli was always her own kind of breakfast TV host and she went out with typical style, on her birthday. Wearing a gold-flecked dress, she farewelled her loyal audience with a quote from Vladimir Nabokov \u2013 \u201cthe refuge of art\u201d \u2013 and a performance by students and graduates from Melbourne University\u2019s Conservatorium of Music. Gender agenda The Oz may have been busy defending itself from outside attacks, but it was also intent on opening up ugly new divisions. As if its obsessive reporting on Victoria\u2019s Safe Schools program wasn\u2019t enough, the Oz announced it had set up a special gender section, featuring almost entirely negative stories about transgender youth, with headlines such as \u201cGender reassignment? They\u2019re castrating children\u201d. The section was condemned by writer Benjamin Law, who offered to donate the cost of a subscription to the Australian to the Gender Centre for every person who cancelled the Oz. Another protester was freelance music writer Sophie Benjamin, who severed her ties with the Oz as a \u201csmall gesture of solidarity as an ally and fellow community member during a time where trans people\u2019s rights to exit are continually being debated\u201d. Subs surface in NZ More than 20 Australian production and subediting jobs have been abolished by Pagemasters in a move designed to cut costs for News Corp. News Corp\u2019s Queensland regional newspapers and the NT News have had their subbing outsourced to Pagemasters, a division of AAP, after it sacked most of its production staff. Pagemasters told staff it was moving their jobs to New Zealand next month because of the \u201ccost to the client\u201d. \u201cWithout making this change, Pagemasters would have lost the work for these regional newspapers altogether,\u201d the manager said. Because the jobs were classified as casual, the journos are not entitled to any compensation. At a time when Nine newspapers are moving their subbing back in-house after the New Zealand experiment failed, it does seem a backward move. Hitting the roof Australia\u2019s Clean Energy Regulator was forced to issue a statement correcting stories in the News Corp papers about its report on the standard and safety of rooftop solar installations. The regulator said some of the reporting of its solar panel inspection results was \u201cin our view \u2026 not an accurate interpretation of the data\u201d. \u201cThe standards set in our inspections program are very high and the inspections are thorough,\u201d the regulator said. Clean energy website One Step Off the Grid said the regulator\u2019s report had revealed a small year-on-year rise in the number of \u201csub-standard\u201d and \u201cunsafe\u201d installations. The Australian interpreted the rise as \u201cOne in five solar units defective\u201d and the Daily Telegraph as \u201cComplaints rise to one a day, as report reveals a quarter of home installations are faulty\u201d while the Courier-Mail called on the energy minister, Angus Taylor, to shut down rooftop \u201csolar shonks.\u201d Preferred facts Sky News Australia host Rowan Dean did not want to listen to the authorities when they said mental illness was behind Tuesday\u2019s stabbing in Sydney, which left one woman dead and one injured. Police commissioner Mick Fuller said the attacks were not being treated as a terrorist attack but the 20-year-old did have \u201csome ideologies in relation to terrorism\u201d and the joint counter-terrorism team would examine if the terrorism threat needed to be reassessed. The Spectator Australia editor said the \u201chairsplitting\u201d between mental illness and terrorism was \u201claughable and an insult\u201d to our intelligence.

Freudenberg, who died last month aged 85, was a central figure in the Labor party for more than 40 years, writing for federal Labor leaders Arthur Calwell, Whitlam and Hawke and the New South Wales Labor premiers Neville Wran, Barrie Unsworth and Bob Carr. The former prime minister Paul Keating said Freudenberg was a \u201cliterary prince\u201d whose death ended \u201ca lifetime of fidelity to the precepts of the Labor party and every uplifting thing he understood it to be about\u201d.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it from me for today. Here\u2019s what\u2019s happened: Donald Trump is speaking at a rally in New Hampshire. So far, he has used a racist slur to describe senator and 2020 candidate Elizabeth Warren and reiterated that his trade war with China is going swimmingly. A court has rejected an appeal from the Trump administration and insisted that migrant children in detention must be provided with soap and a place to sleep. An internal watchdog at the State Department found leadership and management problems, and a pattern of retaliation against employees perceived to oppose Trump. Most of today\u2019s news cycle has focused on Israel\u2019s decision to block two progressive congresswomen, Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar, from entering the country. The move was announced shortly after Trump said in a tweet that allowing the lawmakers to visit would show \u201cgreat weakness\u201d. Israel\u2019s decision was quickly denounced by many Democratic lawmakers and even a few Republicans. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said she was \u201cdeeply saddened\u201d by the news. The two congresswomen affected by the decision also weighed in, with Omar calling it \u201can affront\u201d and Tlaib arguing the move was \u201ca sign of weakness\u201d. In other news, the House judiciary committee has subpoenaed two former Trump aides, the former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and the former White House official Rick Dearborn. The former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper dropped out of the presidential race, but he left the door opening to challenging the Republican senator Cory Gardner next year. Democratic presidential candidate and New Jersey senator Cory Booker commemorates rapper Nipsey Hussle\u2019s birthday. Hussle, who would have been 34 today, spoke openly about his past involvement with gangs and their impact on his neighborhood in Los Angeles, before being shot and killed in March. He was deeply invested in his community, started and supported black-owned businesses and transformed the strip mall he owned into a gathering spot. \u201cHis death was a tragic reminder that far too many Black men\u2019s lives are cut short by gun violence,\u201d writes Booker. As supporters await Trump in New Hampshire, where he is holding a rally, the president offered some more thoughts on his ongoing trade war with China: \u201cI think the longer the trade war goes on, the weaker China gets and the stronger we get,\u201d he said after deboarding his plane in New Hampshire, according to reports from the White House press pool. He also said, commenting on Israel\u2019s decision to block a visit from Ilhan Omar and Rashida Talib, \u201cI can\u2019t imagine why Israel would let them in. But if they want to let them in, they can, but can\u2019t imagine why they would do it.\u201d Earlier today, Trump more strongly urged Israel to keep them out, tweeting that \u201cit would show a great weakness\u201d to let the progressive members of Congress to proceed with their visit. The House republic whip, Steve Scalise seems to back Israel\u2019s decision to block representatives Rashida Talib and Ilhan Omar, noting their support of \u201cthe anti-Semetic BDS movement.\u201d The State Department\u2019s internal watchdog found \u201cevidence of leadership and management deficiencies and mistreatment of career employees\u201d within the State Department. In a report, the department\u2019s inspector general found a \u201cvindictive\u201d work environment. The assistant secretary of state Kevin Moley and his former senior adviser Marie Stull reportedly retaliated against employees. Career employees said Stull, \u201creferred to them or to other career employees as \u2018Obama holdovers,\u2019 \u2018traitors,\u2019 or \u2018disloyal,\u2018\u201d ... Other career employees told (the inspector general) that Ms. Stull accused them of being part of the \u2018Deep State\u2019 and that the assistant secretary accused them of \u2018undermining the president\u2019s agenda.\u2019\u201d The findings were based on a review of thousands of emails and more than 40 interviews with current and former employees. Democrats in Congress urged the investigation after hearing that Trump administration-appointed leaders at the department was mistreating employees that they thought opposed the president. From the Associated Press: Stull has since left the State Department and did not respond to the allegations. In a response to the report, Moley, who is still serving as the assistant secretary, denied any unprofessional behavior and disputed the inspector general\u2019s characterizations of numerous meetings he had with superiors to discuss concerns about his leadership of the bureau. ... \u201cToday\u2019s report confirms what we feared: \u2018disrespectful and hostile\u2019 treatment of career employees at the State Department, including spurious accusations that public servants were \u2018disloyal\u2019 and improper retaliation against them,\u201d said Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Engel called for Moley to be fired or to resign The EPA has withdrawn its decision to use \u201ccyanide bombs\u201d to kill wild animals. Last week, The Guardian reported on the Trump administrations to use controversial poison devices to kill coyotes, foxes and other animals across the US: The spring-loaded traps, called M-44s, are filled with sodium cyanide and are most frequently deployed by Wildlife Services, a federal agency in the US Department of Agriculture that kills vast numbers of wild animals each year, primarily for the benefit of private farmers and ranchers. In 2018, Wildlife Services reported that its agents had dispatched more than 1.5 million native animals, from beavers to black bears, wolves, ducks and owls. Roughly 6,500 of them were killed by M-44s. The poison killed a pet dog in 2017, and has faced intense opposition from environmental groups and members of the public. Trump wants the US to buy Greenland, the Wall Street Journal reports. Check out the mind-boggling story: The idea of the U.S. purchasing Greenland has captured the former real-estate developer\u2019s imagination, according to people familiar with the deliberations, who said Mr. Trump has, with varying degrees of seriousness, repeatedly expressed interest in buying the ice-covered autonomous Danish territory between the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans. In meetings, at dinners and in passing conversations, Mr. Trump has asked advisers whether the U.S. can acquire Greenland, listened with interest when they discuss its abundant resources and geopolitical importance, and, according to two of the people, has asked his White House counsel to look into the idea. Some of his advisers have supported the concept, saying it was a good economic play, two of the people said, while others dismissed it as a fleeting fascination that will never come to fruition. It is also unclear how the U.S. would go about acquiring Greenland even if the effort were serious. Apparently, the US government had tried to buy Greenland before -- in 1946 and in 1867. A panel of judges has ruled that migrant children must have access to soap, toothpaste and a place to sleep. The Trump administration had contended that detained immigrant children, who are required to be provided with \u201csafe and sanitary\u201d conditions, didn\u2019t need to be given basic hygiene products. The government had appealed a 2017 decision by a lower court judge that a landmark 1997 settlement called the Flores Agreement required that kids be provided with soap and toothpaste even though those items weren\u2019t specifically listed. A Trump administration lawyer infamously tried to argue the point in June. Today the Ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco dismissed the challenge, writing: \u201cAssuring that children eat enough edible food, drink clean water, are housed in hygienic facilities with sanitary bathrooms, have soap and toothpaste, and are not sleep deprived are without doubt essential to the children\u2019s safety.\u201d That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague Maanvi Singh will be taking over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Most of today\u2019s news cycle has focused on Israel\u2019s decision to block two progressive congresswomen, Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar, from entering the country. The move was announced shortly after Trump said in a tweet that allowing the lawmakers to visit would show \u201cgreat weakness\u201d. Israel\u2019s decision was quickly denounced by many Democratic lawmakers and even a few Republicans. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said she was \u201cdeeply saddened\u201d by the news. The two congresswomen affected by the decision also weighed in, with Omar calling it \u201can affront\u201d and Tlaib arguing the move was \u201ca sign of weakness\u201d. In other news, the House judiciary committee has subpoenaed two former Trump aides, the former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and the former White House official Rick Dearborn. The former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper dropped out of the presidential race, but he left the door opening to challenging the Republican senator Cory Gardner next year. Maanvi will be covering more fallout from Israel\u2019s decision and Trump\u2019s rally in New Hampshire tonight, so stay tuned. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said she would not move forward with any visits to Israel until \u201call members of Congress\u201d could travel to the country. The New York Democrat earlier said the Netanyahu government\u2019s decision to block her fellow \u201cSquad\u201d members, Omar and Tlaib, from entering Israel proved that Trump was \u201cexporting his bigotry.\u201d Senator Susan Collins, a Republican of Maine, said Israel should allow Tlaib and Omar to visit and criticized Trump for pushing the Netanyahu government to block their trip. Representative Steve King fired back against the chairwoman of the House Republican Conference, Representative Liz Cheney, after she said he should resign over his recent abortion comments. King was responding to this tweet from Cheney, who previously called for the Iowa congressman to resign over his comments about white nationalism and white supremacy. Cheney\u2019s initial comment came after King offered an offensive justification for his opposition to abortion in cases of rape or incest. \u201cWhat if we went back through all the family trees and just pulled out anyone who was a product of rape or incest?\u201d King told a local conservative group in Iowa. \u201cWould there be any population of the world left if we did that?\u201d Daniel Shapiro, a former US ambassador to Israel, said the Netanyahu government\u2019s decision to block Omar and Tlaib\u2019s trip is a gift to the movement to boycott Israel. He writes for the Atlantic: Trump\u2019s racism and Netanyahu\u2019s dependency have brought us to this point. Israel is showing disrespect to the U.S. Congress and looking afraid to engage Americans who disagree with it. Together, they have produced deep alienation among some of Israel\u2019s closest friends in the Democratic Party, such as House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, who led a large delegation to Israel just last week. They have provoked deservedly harsh criticism of Israel\u2019s decision from progressive and minority Democratic constituencies, the rising American majority. And they have elevated Tlaib and Omar into heroes. What a bulldozer to drive through the bipartisan consensus on Israel. What a gift to the BDS movement, which until now, most Americans had never heard of. What a self-own. Two more Democratic presidential candidates, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, sharply criticized Trump for pushing Israel to block Tlaib and Omar\u2019s trip. A lawyer for Corey Lewandowski, Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, raised doubts about why his client was being subpoenaed to testify again before a House committee. But in previous appearances, Lewandowski has declined to discuss anything that happened after he left the Trump campaign in June 2016, frustrating House Democrats seeking information on the president\u2019s potential obstruction of justice. In his report, Robert Mueller said Trump asked Lewandowski to pressure then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to curtail the special counsel\u2019s investigation. Representative Rashida Tlaib said in another tweet that she was \u201clooking forward\u201d to the Israel trip and expressed hope that she would be able to visit the country in the future. At least one House Republican, Representative Chip Roy of Texas, has come out in support of Israel\u2019s decision to block Tlaib and Omar\u2019s trip. \u201cMost recent indications are that Reps Omar and Tlaib were not going to engage Israel meaningfully or even at all,\u201d Roy said, asserting the congresswomen should have joined another recent trip to Israel. \u201cI stand fully with Prime Minister Netanyahu and Israel regarding their right to deny admittance to anyone who advocates against the interests of Israel.\u201d Representative Rashida Tlaib has now also weighed in on Israel\u2019s decision to block her trip there, saying it showed \u201cweakness.\u201d The other congresswoman affected by Israel\u2019s move, Representative Ilhan Omar, said earlier that the Netanyahu government\u2019s decision was \u201can affront.\u201d Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said he opposed the Netanyahu government\u2019s decision to block Omar and Tlaib\u2019s planned trip, while emphasizing that he remains a \u201cstalwart supporter of Israel.\u201d Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, another member of the congressional group known as \u201cthe Squad,\u201d has denounced Israel\u2019s decision to block Tlaib and Omar\u2019s planned trip there. The fourth progressive member of \u201cthe Squad,\u201d Representative Ayanna Pressley, said earlier today that the decision was \u201cbigoted, short sighted and cruel.\u201d Republican Senator Marco Rubio said it was \u201ca mistake\u201d not to let Tlaib and Omar travel to Israel, arguing that the move would bolster the progressive lawmakers\u2019 calls to boycott the country: Representative Ilhan Omar has issued a statement on Israel\u2019s decision to block a trip that she and Representative Rashida Tlaib planned to take to the country, calling it \u201can affront\u201d and accusing the Netanyahu government of acting on Trump\u2019s Muslim ban. The White House has repeatedly invoked executive privilege to block former aides from testifying to House committees, but that power could be tested with Corey Lewandowski\u2019s subpoena. Lewandowski previously served as Trump\u2019s campaign manager, but he never had a formal role in the administration. House Democrats hope that his lack of White House experience will preempt claims of executive privilege. The House judiciary committee has subpoenaed two former Trump aides, former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and former White House official Rick Dearborn. Both aides featured prominently in the portion of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report on whether the president obstructed justice. The news also comes hours before Lewandowski, who is considering a Senate bid in New Hampshire, is slated to join Trump at a rally in the state. Several more Democratic presidential candidates have issues statements condemning Israel\u2019s decision to block Omar and Tlaib\u2019s planned trip. Billionaire activist Tom Steyer also said in a statement that Trump\u2019s demand to block the trip was \u201can affront to core American ideals.\u201d Nancy Pelosi has put out a statement saying she is \u201cdeeply saddened\u201d by Israel\u2019s decision to block Omar and Tlaib\u2019s trip. \u201cAs one who loves Israel, I am deeply saddened by the news that Israel has decided to prevent Members of Congress from entering the country,\u201d the House speaker said. \u201cLast month, Israeli Ambassador Dermer stated that, \u2018Out of respect for the U.S. Congress and the great alliance between Israel and America, we would not deny entry to any Member of Congress into Israel.\u2019 This is a sad reversal and is deeply disappointing. I pray that the Government of Israel will reverse that denial. \u201cIsrael\u2019s denial of entry to Congresswomen Tlaib and Omar is a sign of weakness, and beneath the dignity of the great State of Israel. The President\u2019s statements about the Congresswomen are a sign of ignorance and disrespect, and beneath the dignity of the Office of the President.\u201d Some of John Hickenlooper\u2019s fellow Democratic presidential candidates thanked him for his public service as he announced he would drop out of the race. John Hickenlooper has just posted a video announcing he is suspending his presidential bid, confirming earlier reports that he would drop out. But the former Colorado governor sidestepped whether he would seek the state\u2019s Senate seat. \u201cI\u2019ve heard from so many Coloradans who want me to run for the United States Senate,\u201d Hickenlooper said in the video. \u201cThey remind me how much is at stake for our country. And our state. I intend to give that some serious thought.\u201d David Friedman, the US ambassador to Israel, said in a statement that he would support the Netanyahu government\u2019s decision to block Omar and Tlaib\u2019s trip. \u201cThe United States supports and respects the decision of the Government of Israel to deny entry to the Tlaib/Omar Delegation,\u201d Friedman said. \u201cThis trip, pure and simple, is nothing more than an effort to fuel the BDS engine that Congresswomen Tlaib and Omar so vigorously support,\u201d Friedman added, comparing the boycott movement to \u201ceconomic warfare.\u201d \u201cLike the United States, Israel is a nation of laws. We support Israel\u2019s application of its laws in this case.\u201d The pro-Israel group AIPAC, which has voiced strenuous disagreement with Omar and Tlaib in the past, said the progressive congresswomen should nonetheless be allowed to travel to Israel. House majority leader Steny Hoyer also said he had been working to convince Israel\u2019s prime minister and US ambassador to allow the trip to proceed. He added that the move to block the visit represented a \u201cgrave mistake that undermines the bipartisan pro-Israel consensus.\u201d On the heels of getting them blocked from traveling to Israel, Trump claimed Tlaib and Omar were \u201cthe face\u201d of the Democratic Party: A New York Times reporter argued that Trump\u2019s targeting of the progressive congresswomen may reflect his hope to make them a foil that he can campaign against: Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Israel officially decided to block Representatives Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib\u2019s planned visit to the country. The decision came shortly after Trump made public (via Twitter) his request that the two progressive lawmakers\u2019 travel be blocked. Democrats criticized Trump for his interference, arguing that the president was executing an unconstitutional abuse of power by impeding the foreign travel of two congresswomen. Former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper is expected to drop out of the 2020 presidential race today. The blog is still covering fallout from Israel\u2019s decision, so stay tuned. Representative Tom Malinowski, a House Democrat and a former assistant secretary of state under the Obama administration, referred back to Trump\u2019s racist tweets about Tlaib and the rest of \u201cthe Squad\u201d to express bafflement about his Israel comments: Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has issued a statement defending his decision to block Tlaib and Omar from entering the country. \u201cThere is no country in the world that respects the U.S. and the American Congress more than Israel,\u201d Netanyahu said. \u201cHowever, the itinerary showed that the congresswomen\u2019s sole intention was to harm Israel.\u201d He added that Tlaib may be allowed to travel to the West Bank if she submitted a request on humanitarian grounds to visit family there. A reporter for the Israeli outlet Channel 13 News noted that Tlaib and Omar\u2019s support of the movement to boycott Israel was well known when their visit to the country was approved. The only factor that has shifted in the month since then is that Trump has voiced complaints about allowing the two lawmakers\u2019 trip to proceed, suggesting that the Netanyahu government acted under pressure from the US president. Representative Ayanna Pressley, another member of the congressional group known as \u201cthe Squad,\u201d said she stood by Tlaib and Omar as Israel blocked them from entering the country. The fourth progressive member of the Squad, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, has not yet commented. More Democratic presidential candidates are criticizing Trump for urging Israel to block Tlaib and Omar\u2019s trip: The Democratic chairman of the House judiciary committee argued that the Netanyahu government\u2019s decision would make it more difficult to have productive conversations about the issues Israel cares most about: \u201cThe close relationship enjoyed by the United States and Israel should extend to all its government representatives, regardless of their views on specific issues or policies,\u201d Representative Jerry Nadler said in his statement. \u201cI strongly condemn this decision and urge the Israeli government to allow entry to these Congresswomen and welcome them in the respectful, dignified manner to which they are entitled as official representatives of the United States.\u201d A resolution from Representative Ilhan Omar affirming Americans\u2019 right to participate in boycotts \u201cin pursuit of civil rights at home and abroad\u201d is currently before Nadler\u2019s committee for consideration. Senior Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi called Israel\u2019s decision to block Tlaib and Omar\u2019s trip \u201can outrageous act of hostility against the American people and their representatives.\u201d \u201cThis is a dangerous precedent that defies all diplomatic norms and an assault on the Palestinian people\u2019s right to engage with the rest of the world,\u201d Ashrawi said in a statement. \u201cThis trip was their right and duty as members of Congress, who oversee US policies and actions that affect Palestine, Israel, and countries worldwide. ... \u201cIsrael is fittingly acting like any other rogue state engaged in widespread and systematic human rights abuses, wanting to ensure that its violations remain obscured by all means possible, including coercion and censorship,\u201d Ashrawi said, adding that Trump\u2019s comments on the matter amounted to \u201chateful incitement.\u201d The group that helped organize Tlaib and Omar\u2019s trip to Israel called the Netanyahu government\u2019s decision to block them \u201can affront to the American people and their representatives.\u201d \u201cIt is an assault on the Palestinian people\u2019s right to reach out to decision-makers and other actors from around the world,\u201d MIFTAH\u2019s board of directors said in a statement. \u201cThis ban is a clear case of discrimination and hostility based on political views and ethnic background, deserving of moral indignation and unequivocal condemnation in Palestine and the United States.\u201d Another group, the the Palestine Institute for Public Diplomacy, argued the decision was an extension of the House\u2019s recent passage of a resolution opposing the boycott movement against Israel. \u201cBarring Congresswomen Omar and Tlaib from coming to Palestine is an extension of curbing the freedom of speech we recently saw by the resolution in the US Congress,\u201d executive director Salem Barahmeh said. \u201cThe Israeli government and its allies are set to shut down those who stand up for freedom, equality and justice.\u201d Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders demanded that Israel reverse course and allow Tlaib and Omar\u2019s visit to occur, echoing a similar comment from Elizabeth Warren: Some of Trump\u2019s critics argued his efforts to block the international travel of two Democratic congresswomen marked an unconstitutional abuse of power. From a former speechwriter to George W. Bush: From a former Clinton White House staffer: Two Palestinian-Arab parliamentarians in Israel slammed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government over the decision to block Tlaib and Omar from entering the country: A senior Israeli official said the government has officially decided to block Tlaib and Omar\u2019s planned visit. \u201cThe decision has been made, the decision is not to allow them to enter,\u201d Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely told Israel\u2019s Reshet Radio. The president of the nonprofit J Street \u2013 which describes itself as \u201cthe political home of pro-Israel, pro-peace Americans\u201d \u2013 issued a statement slamming the move to block Tlaib and Omar\u2019s trip. J Street president Jeremy Ben-Ami said such a decision would be \u201cdangerous, unacceptable and wrong.\u201d \u201cAs sitting Members of Congress representing hundreds of thousands of Americans in their districts, Reps. Omar and Tlaib have the same right as every one of their colleagues to visit Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory,\u201d Ben-Ami said. \u201cWe may disagree with the views that the Members hold on such questions as BDS or with Rep. Tlaib on the two-state solution, but the right approach for a state that values democracy is to welcome criticism and debate, not to shut it down. \u201cThe fact that President Trump has already tweeted out his own call for these representatives to be denied entry illustrates that this decision is motivated purely by politics and ideology \u2013 not by the interests of the State of Israel. It is an affront to Congress and the American people and does severe damage to the US-Israel relationship \u2013 and it must be reversed immediately.\u201d Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren said Israel would harm its reputation as a \u201ctolerant democracy\u201d if it blocked Tlaib and Omar\u2019s planned visit. The Massachusetts senator added that such a move would be \u201cshameful\u201d and \u201cunprecedented.\u201d One of the key points of contention about Tlaib and Omar\u2019s trip to Israel appears to be their planned visit to the Al Aqsa Mosque in East Jerusalem. The New York Times has more: A sacred site revered by Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary and by Jews as Temple Mount, the location of their ancient temples, it is a frequent flash point in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Danny Ayalon, a former Israeli ambassador to the United States and a former deputy foreign minister, told Israel\u2019s Kan Radio on Thursday that the congresswomen should be allowed to enter Israel \u2018but with restrictions.\u2019 \u2018If they want to stage a provocation by entering the Temple Mount with Palestinian hosts, then that can be prevented,\u2019 he said. Former Israeli diplomats encouraged the prime minister to allow Tlaib and Omar to visit, arguing that giving in to Trump\u2019s requests would display weakness: A report emerged last week that Trump had told advisers he wanted Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to block the visit by Tlaib and Omar. Axios reported: Trump has told U.S. advisers, including senior Trump administration officials, that Israel should bar Omar and Tlaib\u2019s entry because the two congresswomen favor a boycott of Israel, according to sources familiar with Trump\u2019s private comments. In 2017, Israel\u2019s parliament passed a law requiring the interior minister to block foreign nationals from entering Israel if they have supported boycotting the Jewish state. ... Trump said that if Omar and Tlaib wanted to boycott Israel, \u2018then Israel should boycott them,\u2019 according to a source with direct knowledge. Trump\u2019s tweet about Tlaib and Omar contradicts a statement put out by his press secretary just an hour ago, which said that the White House would allow Israel to reach its own decision about whether to block the progressive lawmakers\u2019 visit. Trump is just full of advise for his fellow world leaders today. He has also advised the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, to meet with the pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. Trump implied yesterday that US-China trade negotiations could be affected if Beijing did not treat the protesters \u201chumanely.\u201d That warning came as footage emerged of Chinese troop movements near the Hong Kong border and state media outlets warning that \u201canti-China forces\u201d would be stopped. Trump has weighed in on Representatives Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar\u2019s planned trip to Israel, encouraging Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to block the progressive congresswomen from entering the country. In the wake of the El Paso shooting, Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker has released a plan to combat white supremacist violence and the rise of hate crimes. Booker said in a statement announcing the plan that his proposals to reduce gun violence \u201cwould make it much harder for those intent on committing hate crimes to access guns. But we also need to focus on violence motivated by hate and white supremacy. \u201cThat\u2019s why, as president, Cory would confront rising hate crimes and white supremacist violence by improving the federal and local response, addressing online hate, and supporting communities and victims of hate crimes.\u201d Booker proposes creating a White House Office on Hate Crimes and White Supremacist Violence to coordinate efforts to reduce such tragedies and requiring federal law enforcement agencies to provide an annual report on the threat of white supremacy. The New Jersey senator would also call on the Justice Department and the FBI to prioritize domestic terrorism in the same way that they do international terrorism. An autopsy of financier and alleged sex-trafficker Jeffrey Epstein uncovered some broken bones in his neck, raising more questions about his apparent suicide. The Washington Post reports: Among the bones broken in Epstein\u2019s neck was the hyoid bone, which in men is near the Adam\u2019s apple. Such breaks can occur in those who hang themselves, particularly if they are older, according to forensics experts and studies on the subject. But they are more common in victims of homicide by strangulation, the experts said. ... People familiar with the autopsy, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitive stage of the investigation, said Sampson\u2019s office is seeking additional information on Epstein\u2019s condition in the hours before his death. That could include video evidence of the jail hallways, which may establish whether anyone entered Epstein\u2019s cell during the night he died; results of a toxicology screening to determine if there was any unusual substance in his body; and interviews with guards and inmates who were near his cell. Israel is considering blocking Democratic Representatives Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar from entering the country. The progressive lawmakers, two members of the congressional group known as \u201cthe Squad,\u201d are slated to arrive on Sunday. They have previously been critical of Israel\u2019s stance toward Palestine and are supportive of the boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement to protest those policies. Israeli Ambassador Ron Dermer said last month that his country would not deny entry to any lawmaker \u201cout of respect for the U.S. Congress and the great alliance between Israel and America.\u201d But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu now appears to be reconsidering that, consulting with several advisers about the planned trip. An Israeli official said, \u201cThere is a possibility that Israel will not allow the visit in its current proposed format.\u201d Democratic lawmakers and some pro-Israel groups in the US have already started pushing back against Netanyahu, so it\u2019s unclear if he will follow through on the plan. A new poll found that overwhelming majorities of Americans back universal background checks and red flag laws, while support for an assault weapons ban is on the rise. According to the Fox News poll, 90 percent of Americans believe criminal background checks should be required for all gun purchases, and 81 percent support passing red flag laws that would allow judges to take away guns from those deemed dangerous. The percentage of Americans who back a ban on assault rifles and semi-automatic weapons has risen since last year, from 60 percent to 67 percent. But that support is largely driven by Democrats, as Republicans remain split on the issue. Trump\u2019s approval rating has also dipped, from 46 percent last month to 43 percent now. Good morning, live blog readers! It would appear that the 2020 presidential race is going to have to make do with one less Democrat, which should be fine because there will still be more than 20 of them running. John Hickenlooper is expected to drop out of the race today. The former governor of Colorado has failed to catch fire with his more moderate message, and his most memorable moment from the last debates was when got Bernie Sanders to throw his hands up. It\u2019s unclear whether Hickenlooper will then enter the Colorado Senate race, but he has reportedly discussed the idea with his advisers. These departures will likely ramp up now that we are less than two weeks away from the Aug. 28 deadline to qualify for the next debate. Only nine candidates have qualified so far, and Juli\u00e1n Castro and Tom Steyer both remain one poll away from making the cut. All of the other dozen or so candidates seem likely to miss the debate stage, giving them few paths forward to reaching Democratic voters. And candidates like Beto O\u2019Rourke and Steve Bullock are similarly being pressured to drop out and run for the Senate instead (although O\u2019Rourke has qualified for the next debate). With little chance of winning the nomination, these remaining candidates will likely soon face the same question: what\u2019s the point? Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping its eye on: Donald Trump will speak at a rally in Manchester, new Hampshire, tonight at 7pm EDT. Beto O\u2019Rourke will return to the campaign trail today, starting with a morning speech in El Paso. Greg Abbott, the Republican governor of Texas, will hold a town hall tonight that will likely touch on the recent mass shooting in El Paso and potential measures to prevent future such tragedies. That\u2019s all still coming up, so stay tuned.",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump is fond of bragging about his conspicuous wealth and buying power, plastering his name over buildings and gilding the elevators of Trump Tower. But his latest reported aspiration is on the extravagant side, even for him: to purchase Greenland from Denmark. According to the Wall Street Journal, the US president has \u201cexpressed interest\u201d in buying the expansive icy territory for the US, and has asked his aides to explore the possibility. He has even sought the view of the White House counsel, though the Journal noted his inquiries came \u201cwith varying degrees of seriousness\u201d. News that Trump had set his sights on acquiring a meaty chunk of the Kingdom of Denmark set Twitter aflutter on Thursday night. Pundits tried in vain to find a real estate valuation for the 811,000 square miles on Zillow, while others attempted to calculate Greenland\u2019s worth in pickled herring. Despite the levity the idea has provoked, it is not entirely in the realm of fantasy. In 1946 US President Harry Truman tried to buy Greenland from Denmark for $100m but was rebuffed. There was a more successful precedent dating back to 1917 when the US acquired the Danish West Indies, rebranding them the US Virgin Islands. The US military already has a major airbase on Greenland, on the north-west of the island. The base has 600 personnel and is important in the country\u2019s global radar system. Trump travels to Denmark next month in his first official visit to the kingdom, though Greenland is not thought to be on the agenda. The Journal reported that the president raised the issue at a dinner last year in which he said he had heard Denmark was finding its financial support to the self-governing territory burdensome. Floating the thought of the US buying the island, he asked the other guests: \u201cWhat do you guys think about that?\u201d What Denmark thinks about that is in itself not at all clear. The Guardian asked the Danish embassy in Washington for a comment but did not receive an immediate response.",
