      "bodyText": "Scott Morrison has responded to an impassioned speech by the Swedish teenage climate activistGreta Thunberg at the United Nations by declaring the climate change debate is subjecting Australian children to \u201cneedless anxiety\u201d. The Australian prime minister, who will address environmental themes in his address to the UN general assembly on Wednesday, including ocean management, plastics, waste management and illegal fishing, was asked for his response to Thunberg\u2019s excoriation of world leaders at this week\u2019s climate action summit, when she accused the political class of failing the younger generations. Morrison told reporters he acknowledged \u201chow deeply people feel about this issue\u201d but said the public debate was replete with disinformation about Australia\u2019s climate change policies. \u201cIt often comes as news to people when I share with them Australia has the highest per capita investment in renewable energy of any country in the world,\u201d Morrison said \u2013 in the process neglecting to mention that his predecessor Tony Abbott had tried to wind back the renewable energy target, which triggered an investment strike. Morrison said he would use his looming address to the UN \u2013 his final public commitment before leaving New York for Australia on Wednesday \u2013 to address the lack of awareness about \u201cthe action Australia has been taking\u201d. \u201cI do understand that people feel strongly about this, but I think we also have to take stock, we have to ensure we get a proper context and perspective,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cI want children growing up in Australia to feel positive about their future, and I think it is important we give them that confidence that they will not only have a wonderful country and pristine environment to live in, that they will also have an economy to live in as well. \u201cI don\u2019t want our children to have anxieties about these issues.\u201d Asked whether Australian children would be less anxious about the worst-case scenarios associated with climate change if Australia\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions were falling instead of rising, and if the Morrison government would make a clear commitment to reaching net zero emissions by 2050, the prime minister said kids needed to be given \u201ccontext and perspective\u201d. He acknowledged that he spoke to his own daughters, aged 10 and 12, about climate change. \u201cWe don\u2019t have deep conversations about emissions reduction targets and what\u2019s happening with the Kyoto protocol and Paris, but we talk about fossil fuels and we talk about what they learn at school, and I encourage them to have a passionate independent view about how they see the world, but I also give them a lot of context. \u201cI don\u2019t allow them to be basically contorted into one particular view.

We can\u2019t have them growing up as mushrooms, but we\u2019ve got to get a bit of context into this.\u201d Morrison said being present at the United Nations should also serve as a reminder that the world was fully capable of solving vexed problems and responding to existential threats. \u201cAustralia has dealt with so many issues in the past, and the world has dealt with so many difficult issues in the past, and here [at the UN in New York], we are reminded of that.\u201d Australian observers in New York have told Guardian Australia Morrison\u2019s failure to attend a UN climate action summit on Monday despite being in the US, and his apparent rejection of the need for Australia to do more to address its rising greenhouse gas emissions, had eroded goodwill for the country on the issue. Bill Hare, the chief executive and senior scientist of Climate Analytics and a longtime adviser to countries at climate talks, has dismissed Morrison\u2019s argument this week that China had to be treated as a developed economy in the context of climate change and embark on more ambitious emissions reduction as a \u201cridiculous fake argument\u201d. Hare said China, the world\u2019s most populous country and biggest annual polluter, was not doing anywhere near enough to tackle the crisis, but was doing more than Australia on many measures. It had national policies in a number of areas \u2013 boosting renewable energy, energy efficiency, electric vehicles and efficiency in industry \u2013 where Australia did not. Greenhouse gas emissions have been rising in Australia since the Coalition repealed Labor\u2019s carbon price despite the country\u2019s commitments to reduce pollution under the Paris agreement. Total national emissions have increased each year since 2014. The government says it will meet the commitments made under the Paris agreement, but its carbon pollution roadmap for doing so shows Australia is relying on a 367 megatonne abatement from carry-over credits (an accounting system that allows countries to count carbon credits from exceeding their targets under the soon-to-be-obsolete Kyoto protocol periods against their Paris commitment for 2030) to help meet the 2030 target. The indicative roadmap for emissions reductions to 2030 includes an electric vehicle strategy that the government has not yet unveiled, and the government has also booked just under 100Mt of abatement to \u201ctechnology solutions\u201d that are not specified. Morrison signed a communique at the Pacific Islands Forum that included a commitment to \u201cformulate and communicate mid-century long-term low greenhouse gas emissions development strategies by 2020\u201d \u2013 but asked this week whether he would deliver on that undertaking, the prime minister hedged. Renewables have boomed after rebounding from the Abbott government\u2019s efforts to dismantle the renewable energy target, but a recent forecast from the industry warned that investment has slowed right down in the absence of policy certainty in climate and energy. The Coalition abandoned a key policy mechanism for the electricity sector \u2013 the national energy guarantee \u2013 in the middle of the conservative-led strike on Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s leadership. The forecast from the Clean Energy Council says the large-scale RET, which winds down after 2020, led to 15,700MW of new capacity being financially committed over the past two years, with that generation either under construction or recently commissioned. \u201cBut with the absence of policy certainty beyond the 2020 RET and a range of regulatory barriers to overcome, investment commitments in new generation have fallen dramatically this year,\u201d it said. \u201cQuarterly investment commitments in new renewable energy projects reached a high of over 4500MW in late 2018, but has since collapsed to less than 800MW in each of the first two quarters of 2019.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Morrison government is sitting on a major review it commissioned last year to explore better ways of resettling humanitarian migrants in Australia. The review into integration, employment, and settlement outcomes for refugees and humanitarian entrants, was led by Prof Peter Shergold, the former secretary of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, now coordinator general of refugee resettlement in NSW. Guardian Australia understands the final report was delivered to government in February but the immigration minister, David Coleman, does not intend to release it until the end of this year, when it\u2019s expected to be published along with the government\u2019s response. The government has repeatedly refused requests for both the report and for an explanation of why it hasn\u2019t been released. Shergold was tasked with developing recommendations to improve policy and \u201cbetter ensure refugees and humanitarian entrants can make valuable contributions to our society and our economy,\u201d said the prime minister, Scott Morrison, at the time of the December announcement. Attempts by the opposition to obtain the report under freedom of information laws were refused on the grounds that the document is exempted as being \u201ccabinet in confidence\u201d. The refusal letter confirmed the document either has not yet been submitted to cabinet or is still being considered. Guardian Australia has also sought to obtain the document under FOI. Andrew Giles, the shadow minister for immigration and citizenship, said the review was one \u201cmost Australians would welcome\u201d. \u201cIt serves a really important purpose, but what\u2019s really perplexing is that it\u2019s been kept secret \u2026 when there\u2019s no explanation for why this is the case,\u201d Giles said. At the time the review was announced, there was sector-wide concern over its short timeframe of just two and a half months over the summer period. The review received submissions from groups including from the Refugee Health Network, the Australian College of Nursing, the Settlement Council of Australia (SCoA), the Brotherhood of St Laurence, and the Federation of Ethnic Communities\u2019 Councils of Australia (Fecca). \u201cMany stakeholders, including Fecca, made significant contributions to the Shergold report with a view to improving the settlement process for refugees so they can fully, and more quickly, participate in society,\u201d said Fecca chairperson, Mary Patetsos. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cWe look forward to reading the report and seeing how the government responds to the recommendations.\u201d Chief executive of the SCoA, Tammy Wolffs, said it was disappointing the report hadn\u2019t been released before another inquiry into regional resettlement had begun in the meantime. Wolffs said if the Shergold report had been released it could have informed the current inquiry. She said they hoped the \u201cclosely guarded\u201d report would lead to more integrated services. \u201cWe think it will have quite big implications for the sector \u2026 and how it\u2019s funded,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was a shakeup recently of the way settlement services have been funded and we can see there are better opportunities for integration and funding of settlement services, and the services and opportunities our sector can provide to refugees and other migrants who come through.\u201d Labor\u2019s Giles said the government was releasing policy which \u201cclearly goes to the scope of the review\u201d, and questioned whether those policies were based on the evidence the government had commissioned from the review. He noted a speech given by the federal minister for population, Alan Tudge, on Thursday, in which he flagged incentives for humanitarian entrants to move to the regions to reduce pressure on cities. The federal government has already reduced the migration program cap to 160,000 and dedicated 23,000 places for regional skilled migrations. \u201c[This report is] a bit of work which would inform exactly this, and it\u2019s either not being looked at or is being hidden from the Australian public,\u201d said Giles. Rural Australians for Refugees told the review its proposition that more refugees and secondary migrants will be settled in the regions \u201crepresents both enormous and positive opportunities but also some challenges\u201d. It recommended place-based and needs-based programs, with rural and regional resettlement decisions respecting community identities and avoiding \u201cmetro-centric and top-down program approaches\u201d. Among the submissions, several organisations noted complicated health needs for new humanitarian entrants and difficulties navigating support systems and accessing bulk-billing regional GPs, as well as problems with the current provision of language education, job assistance, and recognising existing skills and qualifications. Poor communication between government departments responsible for resettling new entrants was also noted. There were also repeated mentions of the need for the government to actively change the current negative narrative around refugees and humanitarian entrants. \u201cAll Australians benefit when these migrants are fully welcomed into our workplaces, economies and communities,\u201d said the Centre for Policy Development. A spokeswoman for Coleman did not answer questions, instead saying: \u201cthe Government is considering the report and will provide its response in due course.\u201d",

A Cygnet spokeswoman said: \u201cWhilst 85% of our services are rated \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018outstanding\u2019, the regulatory inspection regime has changed in recent times and this means both independent and NHS providers across the industry are having to adapt. This is not exclusive to Cygnet. \u201cMost of our inadequate facilities are from a recently acquired portfolio and we are undertaking an extensive level of renovations, transforming care plans and adapting to local commissioning demands.\u201d",

As the UN\u2019s chief, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, warned the 74th UN general assembly in New York that the world faced a \u201cgreat fracture\u201d, with the countries at risk of cleaving between the great powers of the US and China, Payne met the Chinese foreign affairs minister on the sidelines of the event for their second conversation in two months. Morrison \u2013 who has not been invited, post-election, to visit the Chinese capital \u2013 later told reporters that the Australian government welcomed the opportunity to talk to Beijing. He said he didn\u2019t see the conflict playing out between Washington and Beijing over trade, and the close alignment of his own language on China with Donald Trump\u2019s, as evidence of the looming fracture forecast by the UN chief. \u201cI am a lot more optimistic about it,\u201d the prime minister said. Rather than seeing the current global tensions as a \u201cgreat conquest of ideologies and belief systems\u201d, he said, it was more accurate to see it as a step change in the global economy, requiring some corrective actions. Global institutions, be they the World Trade Organization or the UN on climate change, had to be \u201crecalibrated to recognise that\u201d. He was unrepentant about redefining China\u2019s economic status as a \u201cnewly developed\u201d economy. \u201cWhen you look at the level of investment China makes in countries outside their own borders, when you look at the level of military expansion within their own ranks \u2013 they are not the actions of a developing country, they are the actions of the second largest economy in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cMoving into the next phase does mean ensuring that we are all playing on a level playing field.\u201d The US president used similar language in his address to the UN general assembly on Tuesday morning, also characterising China as a developed economy. Payne said she did not intend to go into details about Tuesday\u2019s conversation with her Chinese counterpart, including whether any concerns had been expressed about Morrison\u2019s foreign policy pivot this week at the Chicago Institute for Global Affairs, but \u201cit was a very positive meeting, as the prime minister said \u2013 my second meeting in the last two months\u201d. \u201cWe acknowledged our relationship is based on our comprehensive strategic partnership, and that\u2019s the premise from which we begin,\u201d Payne said. She also indicated she had raised human rights issues, including the persecution of Uighurs and the continuing detention of Zhou Yongjun. Morrison flatly rejected the idea that Australia had already picked a side \u2013 the US \u2013 in the rivalry between the world\u2019s great powers. He insisted that would be a \u201cflawed analysis of the situation\u201d. \u201cAmerica is our great ally,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cChina is our comprehensive strategic partner and we continue to maintain that this isn\u2019t a matter of choosing, it is a matter of working closely with both nations in the spirit of those histories and those relationships. \u201cI\u2019ve been saying for time now that I reject the binary narrative that keeps being thrust towards me on this. I don\u2019t buy it and I don\u2019t support it and I\u2019m not going to make decisions based on it. \u201cI think it is a very narrowcast analysis.\u201d In Australia, Morrison government ministers rephrased his characterisation, with the trade minister, Simon Birmingham, describing China has having \u201cdeveloped a long way from where they were\u201d and explaining Australia\u2019s engagement \u201creflects the new development status\u201d. Labor\u2019s shadow finance minister Katy Gallagher said Birmingham had \u201c[refused] to back in \u2026 his prime minister\u2019s language used around this matter\u201d. Gallagher said Labor\u2019s view is China is a developing economy but said it was unhelpful \u201cto be arguing about two words when we have such a significant relationship with China\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, has announced a formal impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump, making him the fourth president in US history to face such an extraordinary investigation. All three precedent cases resulted in impeachment or in the resignation of the president. What is happening? After months of pressure from a significant portion of her caucus to greenlight impeachment proceedings, Pelosi finally came around on Tuesday, after 24 hours in which more than 30 House Democrats joined the call to open an impeachment inquiry. The surge happened after Congress learned of a whistleblower report filed by a member of the intelligence community focusing on a conversation or conversations that Trump had with the president of Ukraine. The conversations reportedly involved the former vice-president Joe Biden, Trump\u2019s potential 2020 opponent. Democrats allege that Trump delayed military aid and pressured Ukraine for information about Biden. Trump denies wrongdoing. How does the procedure work? Pelosi said that the six congressional committees currently investigating potential impeachable offenses by Trump would continue to do so. Based on their findings, the judiciary committee could draft and approve articles of impeachment against Trump, which then would go to the House floor for a vote. If the articles are passed, the Senate will hold a trial on the matter, with a two-thirds majority required to convict and remove the president. As things stand,Trump\u2019s removal from office would thus require the partisan defection of about 20 Republican senators. What\u2019s next? It appears that a lot of additional information about the Ukraine affair is about to come to light. The House intelligence committee has announced that the whistleblower wishes to testify, and could do so as early as this week, meaning that the public could soon learn the details of the allegations against Trump \u2013 and see what evidence there is. In a rare unanimous vote, the Senate on Tuesday approved a resolution calling on the White House to turn over the whistleblower\u2019s report. Trump tweeted on Tuesday that he would release a transcript on Wednesday of a phone call with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, despite earlier vows by Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudy Giuliani that no such transcript would be released. What might Trump be impeached for? That\u2019s an important question. Trump could conceivably face impeachment for a wide range of alleged misconduct including personally profiting from the presidency, violating campaign finance laws, inappropriately diverting funds to build a border wall or dangling pardons to induce lawbreaking. But some commentators have warned that Congress should focus on a narrow group of alleged offenses, not only to avoid the perception of a partisan expedition but also to avoid setting a precedent that could radically expand the scope for future impeachment inquiries. The editors of the Lawfare blog have argued for articles of impeachment that would avoid areas of policy disagreement and be tied only to Trump\u2019s conduct while in office, for which there is the most strong evidence, and on which the constitution is most plain. They recommend five articles: obstruction of justice and abuse of law enforcement institutions and personnel; prosecution of political opponents; abuse of foreign policy authorities; efforts to obstruct or impede congressional investigations; and lying to the American public. What are the political implications? Anybody\u2019s guess. The conventional wisdom is that the impeachment of Bill Clinton in 1998 backfired on Republicans, who saw Clinton\u2019s popularity rise while they suffered heavy losses in the subsequent election. But the causality there is unclear and we don\u2019t have the counterfactual. Pelosi\u2019s longstanding reservations about impeachment, which she made clear repeatedly after the Mueller report was released in redacted form, appeared to be rooted in concerns that impeachment proceedings would make Democrats seem unfocused on the work of governing and possibly help Trump\u2019s re-election bid. She might have a point: \u201cOn average, in all polls since the start of 2017, 38.5 percent of the public favored impeachment and 55.7 percent opposed it,\u201d according to FiveThirtyEight. But for many Democrats, such concerns have gradually paled in comparison with Trump\u2019s alleged criminality. Who has been impeached? Two presidents, Bill Clinton (1998) and Andrew Johnson (1868).

      "bodyText": "A New South Wales farm trespass bill has been criticised by civil liberties organisations, environment groups and unions for turning into \u201ca crackdown on people\u2019s rights to protest\u201d. The Right to Farm Bill 2019, currently before the NSW parliament, can punish unlawful entry and disruption on \u201cinclosed lands\u201d with up to three years in jail, and increases the fine from $5,500 to $22,000. The bill is aimed at stopping animal rights protests on farms, but a range of groups and MPs say the wording would outlaw civil protest on any enclosed space, including schools, hospitals, mine sites or banks. Chris Gambian, the chief executive of the Nature Conservation Council of NSW, said the threat to protest was \u201chidden within this bill\u201d. \u201cIt includes farmers and knitting nanas protesting coal seam gas, unions on worksites, people staging a sit-in in corporate headquarters of a company, and more. On Tuesday, the independent NSW MP Justin Field proposed an amendment that inserts a clause so it \u201cdoes not apply to a person who is engaged in a genuine peaceful demonstration or protest\u201d. Without it, he said the new bill \u201cmassively increases penalties and introduces jail time for peaceful assembly and protest activities that have nothing to do with farming\u201d.

All the research indicates this does not act as a deterrent.\u201d The proposed bill would amend the existing Inclosed Lands Protection Act 1901 to create harsher penalties. It would also add the words \u201cor hinder\u201d to the offence of \u201cinterfering with\u201d business on that land. Under the new penalty, a person would be fined $13,200 or imprisoned for a year (or both) if acting alone, and fined $22,000 and jailed for three years if with two other people or under other aggravating circumstances. Inclosed lands are defined by the act as \u201cany land, either public or private, inclosed or surrounded by any fence, wall or other erection, or by some natural feature \u2026including the whole or part of any building\u201d.

Unions NSW said it was examining the bill closely but was concerned it could inhibit the ability for unions to do their work. Thomas Costa, the assistant secretary of Unions NSW, said it was an attempt to legislate against people\u2019s rights to protest. \u201cThe Liberals have a track record of trying to criminalise dissent.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s our latest news story on Thomas Cook: Thomas Cook directors could face inquiry as rescue effort continues Regulators and MPs were considering investigations into Thomas Cook\u2019s auditors and directors as the fallout from the travel firm\u2019s collapse continued on Tuesday, with thousands of staff and suppliers facing uncertain futures and more than 100,000 holidaymakers still due to be brought home on government rescue flights. Britain\u2019s accountancy regulator, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), said it was considering the case for investigation and enforcement action \u201cas a matter of urgency\u201d, while MPs on the business select committee said there were \u201cserious questions to answer\u201d about how the firm was run. The government has already announced a fast-track inquiry into the collapse by the Insolvency Service, which is charged with closing down the 178-year-old holiday business. Potential concerns for the FRC include the extent of \u201cexceptional items\u201d on the company\u2019s balance sheet, which could have swayed investors and affected annual results \u2013 as well as the profit-related bonuses paid to directors. Thomas Cook was audited by two of the UK\u2019s biggest accountancy firms, with EY succeeding PwC from 2017. The tour operator had a series of finance chiefs over the past two years. The pay of the last three chief executives of Thomas Cook has come under increased scrutiny. Labour\u2019s John McDonnell has urged the former bosses to repay their bonuses while the Confederation of British Industry said \u201cquestions are now rightly being asked\u201d about the \u00a335m paid out over the past 12 years to Manny Fontenla-Novoa, Harriet Green and Peter Fankhauser....

Here\u2019s the ambassador again: Sounds like Condor has its rescue loan: Here\u2019s our latest story about the Thomas Cook staff who\u2019ve lost their jobs: Now this is worrying. Several people have contacted the UK Embassy in Cuba, saying they or their parents are holidaying with Thomas Cook -- and have been ordered to pay massive bills, running into thousands of pounds in some cases. The embassy says it is aware of the problem, and confirmed that hotels should get the money they\u2019re owed through the ATOL protection scheme - not from individual holidaymakers. The UK ambassador in Cuba (Our Man in Havana) says the embassy is working hard to help.... Some readers have written in to argue that the government should have kept Thomas Cook afloat. Tom Jackson of Stockport, Greater Manchester, says the bill would have been tiny, compared to the cost of the financial crisis rescue package: When the Royal Bank of Scotland experienced financial meltdown during the 2007-8 financial crisis Gordon Brown came to the rescue with \u00a346bn government support, claiming that RBS was too big to fail. It\u2019s ironic that this bank requested its customer, Thomas Cook, to seek \u00a3200m to avoid administration and is now responsible for its demise, along with those who ran the travel company and the government. Another old established company bites the dust. But Polly Bird of Bedlington, Northumberland, argues that Thomas Cook customers are getting decent treatment compared to other people who get caught up in travel chaos. We live in strange times. UK holidaymakers were left stranded by holiday company Thomas Cook and the government rushed to organise planes to bring them home (Ministers \u2018scuppered Thomas Cook deal\u2019, 24 September). UK citizens were left traumatised in adverse conditions having survived hurricane Irma and the government left them struggling to make their own ways home. One Thomas Cook holidaymaker in Corfu tweets that Operation Matterhorn isn\u2019t going too smoothly. Her flight home was cancelled on Monday, then the next one was full, so after spending all day at the airport they were sent to a hotel. There was no flight today, so they\u2019ll have to see what happens tomorrow: Reuters is reporting that Germany\u2019s government has decided to give Condor, Thomas Cook\u2019s German airline, a bridge loan. The loan, in partnership with the state of Hesse, could be worth almost \u20ac400m, and would would allow Condor to keep operating. Quite a contrast with London\u2019s refusal to bail out Thomas Cook; the difference, though, is that Condor is profitable rather than insolvent. The Unite union has called for \u201cradical reform\u201d of financial regulation in the UK, following the Thomas Cook crisis. Unite also hit out at the government for announcing a probe into the company - arguing it\u2019s simply too late for staff who\u2019ve lost their jobs. Unite assistant general secretary Diana Holland says the current system is broken: \u201cThe thousands of workers who yesterday lost their jobs, and the hundreds of thousands of people who had their holidays cancelled, will draw no comfort from the announcement of a probe by the Official Receiver. \u201cYet again the Government is guilty of being asleep at the wheel. It failed to learn the lessons from Carillion\u2019s collapse. If the Government had done so, the collapse of Thomas Cook may have been avoided. \u201cThe UK financial regulatory system is broken and without proper checks and balances, we have no idea if other Thomas Cooks and Carillions are in the pipeline and no ability to prevent them from occurring. \u201cThe collapse of Thomas Cook has not been allowed to happen in other countries as their governments and regulators have mechanisms to stop such a disastrous and immediate collapse as has happened in the UK. \u201cRadical reform of the UK\u2019s financial regulatory system must be an absolute priority to prevent other workers in the future being dumped on the scrapheap without warning, through absolutely no fault of their own.\u201d Money Saving Expert, the consumer finance site, reports that some people who\u2019d booked holidays with Thomas Cook have received refunds. Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert.com, says the \u201cchargeback system\u201d, which lets customers reverse a credit card payment, is working. \u201cThe news that people are starting to get payouts should start to allow those people who\u2019ve booked with Thomas Cook and have been holding their breath over the weekend at the panicked thought of lost money to breathe a sigh of relief. \u201cIt\u2019s still early days but at least this shows that attitude-wise, the system is working. Most people will be getting their money back through the ATOL scheme, but those who aren\u2019t getting their money back through that and who paid on plastic we\u2019re now seeing get these chargeback payouts from their card providers. Sky News have also interviewed a Thomas Cook cabin crew worker about the moment they heard the company had gone under - and it\u2019s an emotional read. Julie Burns told Sky: I was on a flight when we found out that we were losing our jobs. I was positioned out to Newcastle for four days and we\u2019d been coming back from Antalya. Before the flight, one of the girls had her phone on so we could see Thomas Cook\u2019s chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, coming out of a meeting and at the time it seemed positive. We were all a little upbeat, although we had got on the flight not knowing if we were going to be paid for it. The most heartbreaking thing is that the passengers knew what had happened before we did. When we landed, they had their phones on and they saw the news. After all the passengers had got off, the senior flight attendant came up and she went, \u201cThat\u2019s it guys, game over\u201d. I said \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d and she said \u201cIt\u2019s over, we\u2019re finished\u201d. We all started crying and were really upset... The full piece is online, here. Newsflash: It\u2019s all gone wrong for Northern Ireland bus-maker Wrightbus. Sky News is reporting that Wrightbus, maker of London\u2019s \u2018Boris Bus\u2019, will fall into administration on Wednesday. Deloitte are expected to be appointed as administrators, putting 1,300 jobs at risk. Sky\u2019s Mark Kleinman says: Sources close to one of the bidders said on Tuesday evening that the appointment of Deloitte was \u201calmost certain\u201d to happen within 24 hours, putting about 1300 jobs at risk. The news will represent a devastating blow to Northern Ireland\u2019s manufacturing sector, with the prospects of Wrightbus being salvaged in its current form now understood to be remote The move means Wrightbus failed in a last-minute dash to find a buyer, following weeks of talks. Thanks to the un-prorogation of parliament, the government could face an urgent question on the collapse of Thomas Cook tomorrow. This is good advice: Thomas Cook holidaymakers: Here\u2019s what to do if your hotel hits you with an unexpected bill... The Press Association have also spoken with Thomas Cook customers whose hotel demanded they hand over money - even though they\u2019re protected by the ATOL scheme. Liam Archer and his partner Ciara Edwards, both from Gloucestershire, were asked by staff at their hotel on Fuerteventura in the Canary Islands to pay the equivalent of more than \u00a3800 to secure their Thomas Cook booking. Mr Archer told the PA news agency: \u201cWe had a note through our door asking us to go to reception. We were then told we had one hour to pay 942 euro otherwise we would have been kicked out of the hotel. \u201cWe rang the CAA and they told us to pay and keep receipts. Very stressful as we have had to ring around to find the money.\u201d Time for a recap Pressure is building on Thomas Cook\u2019s management and auditors after the holiday firm collapsed under a mountain of debt on Monday. Parliament\u2019s business committee has pledged to examine what went wrong. Rachel Reeves MP says there are \u201cserious questions to answer, including about the company\u2019s accounting practices, its renumeration policy and practice, and about the stewardship of the company.\u201d The Financial Reporting Council (which monitors the accountancy and auditing professions) is pondering whether to launch an \u201curgent\u201d inquiry. Such investigations could examine how Thomas Cook paid around \u00a335m to its last three CEOs over the last 12 years, and whether its accounts were fully open and transparent. Business secretary Andrea Leadsom also piled pressure onto directors, saying the Insolvency Service needs to get to the bottom of the situation. The CBI agrees. The warnings came on the second day of Operation Matterhorn, which is repatriating the 160,000 people who were holidaying with Thomas Cook when it fell into liquidation. The Civil Aviation Authority was planning to bring over 16,00 people back to the UK today, having repatriated nearly 15,000 on Monday. The CAA said the operation was going pretty well, although not without some hurdles. Some flights have been delayed, while others are returning passengers to Manchester rather than their intended destinations (such as Newcastle or Gatwick). Thomas Cook customers have also faced demands from hotels to pay bills, despite having already stumped up for their holidays. One told the Guardian that notes were pushed under their doors (photo here), showing how much they had to pay. Customers have also been warned not to fall victim to fraudsters, who may claim to be calling from Thomas Cook with a refund. Rival holiday firm TUI, has been forced to cancel some holidays too, having booked its customers onto Thomas Cook flights. Anger is building against airlines and holiday firms for hiking their prices, as disappointed Thomas Cook customers try to find alternative flights. The BBC have also spoken to Thomas Cook customers who\u2019ve been told to pay for their hotel rooms, despite having already paid for their holidays (a problem we flagged up earlier) Here\u2019s a flavour: Jess Beeton, on holiday with her partner Richard Berrington, said \u201ceveryone who booked through Thomas Cook has been locked out of the rooms\u201d. She added: \u201cThe only option we were given was to pay what Thomas Cook hasn\u2019t, or get our stuff and leave.\u201d Jess said that after the hotel locked them out, she managed to gain access to their room by saying she had medication there that she needed to take. Once inside, she and Richard locked themselves in, but they have since paid \u00a3520 on a credit card so they can stay at the hotel until their due departure date from Spain on Sunday. Thomas Cook\u2019s bosses, directors and auditors have just been warned that they could be hauled to Westminster to explain themselves. Rachel Reeves MP, chair of the BEIS Committee, says parliament wants answers about why the company collapsed, who made mistakes, and how bosses were paid so much for running the firm. \u201cThe public will be rightly appalled that as Thomas Cook mounted up debt and as the company headed for trouble, company bosses were happily pocketing hefty pay-packages. Now, in the aftermath of the company\u2019s collapse, as frustrated travellers are stuck abroad, when holidays are being cancelled and thousands of staff are losing their jobs, there are serious questions to answer, including about the company\u2019s accounting practices, its renumeration policy and practice, and about the stewardship of the company. As a Committee, we are keen to seek answers to these questions and will discuss at the next meeting how we can do that.\u201d Football clubs have offering help to supporters who bought travel packages to games through Thomas Cook\u2019s sports arm. Chelsea has pledged to cover the costs for fans who booked travel with Thomas Cook to Lille or Southampton, and who now need to rebook. Liverpool says it is trying to help supporters who\u2019d bought packages through collapsed Thomas Cook for their next two home games -- against FC Salzburg in the Champions League, and the Premier League fixture against Leicester. Thomas Cook customers have been warned not to fall for fraudsters, who may try to trick them out of their bank details. Barclays Bank has warned people to be on their guard, in case a scammer phones up pretending to be able to help with rebooking a flight. The Take Five campaign to raise fraud awareness also has some advice, including Don\u2019t automatically click on a link in an email or message Be sceptical if you get an unsolicited call Contact your bank using the number or address they supply One Twitter user flags up that people are being targeted: People who booked holidays through travel giant TUI are now caught up in Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse. TUI, who are Europe\u2019s biggest tour operator, had used Thomas Cook Airlines to fly some of its customers to and from their destinations. It has now decided to cancel all such holidays, up until the end of October. In a statement, TUI says: We\u2019ve unfortunately had to cancel any TUI and First Choice bookings featuring Thomas Cook flights for any customers due to travel from Monday 23rd September until 31st October 2019. The advice is not to travel to the airport. We will be organising full holiday refunds for these customers and will process these as quickly as possible. For any TUI and First Choice customers with Thomas Cook flights due to travel after this date, please bear with us as we look at other options and alternatives for you as a priority. We are working hard to help affected customers find alternative holidays, so we will do everything we can to help in these extraordinary circumstances. As we mentioned earlier today, TUI is also pledging to fly home any customers who are already on holiday, and had been scheduled to return on a Thomas Cook flight: Glasgow Airport has just detained four of Thomas Cook\u2019s aeroplanes, as \u2018security\u2019 for the money it is owed by the company, reports the BBC\u2019s Connor Gillies. The last Thomas Cook flight landed in Glasgow early yesterday morning, from Orlando in Florida, a few hours after the company went into liquidations. Scheduled departures from Glasgow were then suspended, as at other UK airports. Airports owed landing fees by Thomas Cook will presumably be joining the ranks of creditors, who must file claims with the Insolvency Service. Spain\u2019s acting tourism minister has said there are 53,000 British tourists currently travelling with Thomas Cook at Spanish resorts. Reyes Maroto also told reporters in Madrid that her ministry has been in touch with German and Swedish authorities to ensure Thomas Cook subsidiaries continue to operate at least for the winter season, Reuters reports. Maroto also chaired a meeting with regional tourism ministers from Canary Islands, Balearic Islands, Valencia, Catalonia and Andalusia and delegates of main Spanish touristic employers\u2019 organizations to evaluate the impact of the collapse of Thomas Cook today. Here\u2019s one of the notes pushed under the doors of Thomas Cook holidaymakers in Mallorca, asking them to pay bills owed by the company (see earlier post). Here\u2019s a couple more photos of Thomas Cook customers trying to get home today: t One Thomas Cook holiday maker describes the situation in his hotel as a \u2018giant self-help group\u2019 after guests were forced to sort out payment issues in the absence of any official help. Reriree Robert Rowe, 67, his wife Maria are staying at Hotel More, a family run hotel in Alcudia town in Mallorca. Rowe said that all hotel guests who were on Thomas Cook packages had notes put under their door on Monday morning asking them for money. He contacted CAA and was told that they were Atol protected and shouldn\u2019t pay the hotel. However many guests were unsure about what to do, he says (via our callout) \u201c95% are people here are pensioners and only a few people can use smartphones and people weren\u2019t getting information as there were no reps around.\u201d \u201cThe hotel manager had asked for people\u2019s bank details. It was very emotional, people were upset. Some guests were trying to sort it out and pass on the information from CAA. It was like a giant self-help group.\u201d Rowe said twenty or thirty guests held an impromptu meeting on Tuesday morning and reiterated that nobody should pay. \u201c The hotel management haven\u2019t asked for any more money. We\u2019re laying low, we have four more days here. I feel sorry for them in a way because they\u2019re a small family run hotel and it seems bad that Thomas Cook have put small traders in this position. But I think the way they handled it was poor. \u201cI come from Melbourne in Derbyshire, where Thomas Cook started. There\u2019s Thomas Cook Close, Thomas Cook Gardens and Thomas Cook almshouses. I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to be called now.\u201d A lot of people face losses because of Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse. The companies suppliers could be left with unpaid bills, while employees need to submit claims to obtain the redundancy payments and wages they\u2019re entitled to. The Insolvency Service has more details here. Here\u2019s our news story about the accountancy watchdog sniffing around Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse: The Confederation of British Industry has backed calls for a probe into the \u201cfat cat\u201d pay at Thomas Cook. Josh Hardie, deputy director-general at the CBI, says (via the Evening Standard). Questions are now rightly being asked about directors\u2019 remuneration and decision-making. Disproportionate rewards are a lightning rod for public discontent, so high pay can only ever be justified by high performance over the long term. The CBI represents Britain\u2019s bosses, so won\u2019t have enjoyed headlines about \u201cfat cats creaming off \u00a347m\u201d. Holidaymakers are sharing their stories of further difficulties as they try and return to the UK (through our callout to readers). Nikita Locke, 22 was on a Thomas Cook package holiday at the SunConnect One hotel in Monastir, Tunisia with her sister Shannon and two young children. They were supposed to be taken by coach organised by the hotel to Enfidha\u2013Hammamet airport on Tuesday but were advised by the hotel to book their own taxi seven hours before their 1015 flight to Birmingham was due to depart, in case of disruption. They paid 120 Tunisian Dinar, about \u00a333.50, for the taxi in advance and were given a receipt by hotel staff but when the taxi arrived the driver claimed he hadn\u2019t been paid by the hotel and demanded more money. Locke said: \u201cIt was 3am and we had the two kids screaming and crying, standing outside the hotel. My sister and I were so stressed wondering if we were going to make it to the airport. I just refused to pay out any more money.\u201d The hotel finally paid the driver 45 minutes later, and the family were taken to the airport. Their flight was due to depart at 10.15 am, but it\u2019s now scheduled to leave at 1.20pm. Reminder: you can shares your experiences here. In Crete, authorities say eight UK-bound flights have been chartered to fly Thomas Cook customers back home today. Some 20,000 Britons have been stranded on the island which has borne the brunt of the fallout in Greece of Thomas Cook\u2019s bankruptcy. Two planes are scheduled to fly to Gatwick, two to Manchester with the rest slated to fly to Newcastle, Birmingham, Glasgow and Bristol. Around 50,000 Thomas Cook customers have been marooned nationwide. Greece, already hard hit by its long-running debt crisis, has been hugely affected by the tour company\u2019s collapse with the country\u2019s tourism confederation estimating today that damages could reach \u20ac500m (up from initial estimates of \u20ac300m). On Tuesday Haris Theoharis, the tourism minister, said the firm owed outstanding payments from mid-July to hotels and other businesses. As the engine of the Greek economy, the tourism industry contributes around a quarter of total economic output, employing an ever growing number of people \u2013 at last count one in five. Relief measures are being considered by the centre right government once total damages are calculated. Following an urgent meeting of tourism and finance ministers last night it emerged that tax cuts are among the measures being considered for enterprises worst affected by the tour operator\u2019s liquidation. The Financial Reporting Council\u2019s job is to \u201cpromote transparency and integrity in business\u201d. That means upholding standards for accounting and actuarial work, and ensuring that corporate reporting and auditing is up to scratch. If it does probe Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse, as it\u2019s threatening, the FRC could examine two issues 1) Thomas Cook\u2019s use of one-off charges. The company was a keen user of \u2018exceptional items\u2019 -- stripping certain costs out of its financial results. That\u2019s perfectly above board in principle, if it gives the City a better view of the underlying business. But it can be abused - which is why auditors need to ensure one-off items really are unusual. 2) Goodwill write-downs. Back in May, Thomas Cook took a \u00a31bn impairment charge relating to its 2007 merger with MyTravel. Thomas Cook said it had to revalue the deal \u201cin light of the weak trading environment\u201d -- but you could ask why it took 12 years to conclude it overpaid. Ben Martin has written a good piece about this in today\u2019s Times, here. He points out that EY took over as Thomas Cook\u2019s auditors in 2017, from PWC, and \u201cstrongly recommended\u201d strengthening its procedures. Newsflash! Britain\u2019s accountancy regulator has announced it could launch an urgent probe into the collapse of Thomas Cook yesterday. The Financial Reporting Council says: \u201cIn light of recent developments at Thomas Cook we are considering whether there is any case for investigation and enforcement action as a matter of urgency and in cooperation with the Insolvency Service.\u201d That follows the government\u2019s decision to fast-track the Insolvency Services\u2019s inquiry into why Thomas Cook fell into insolvency. This is odd. The departures board at Palma Airport is now showing that all the Thomas Cook repatriation flights are delayed until 1am! My colleague Sam Jones has sent this photo of the flights board. It shows that flights to Stansted, Bristol, Manchester, Birmingham, Newcastle, Gatwick, East Midlands and Cardiff have all been pushed back beyond midnight, rather than leaving this morning. However, the CAA website suggests most of the flights were leaving on time, so perhaps this is an error? Sam also reports that the airport is busy, but not as hectic as yesterday. There are FCO staff on the ground, but they\u2019re not allowed to talk to the press. So it\u2019s a confusing picture.... Thomas Cook staff, meanwhile, have been turning up for work despite not knowing if they\u2019ll even get paid. Here\u2019s the latest on Thomas Cook, from Associated Press: The British government has flown home the first 14,500 people stranded by the collapse of tour operator Thomas Cook, and is expected to ramp up the repatriation effort to get all the 150,000 U.K.-based customers home in two weeks. The Civil Aviation Authority said Tuesday the first batch of people were flown back after Thomas Cook ceased all operations Monday, leaving hundreds of thousands stranded around the world. It was still unclear how many of the 600,000 total that were traveling with the company as of Sunday would remain stranded. German authorities were still mulling a request for a bridging loan from airline Condor, a subsidiary of Thomas Cook. The company\u2019s Dutch subsidiary said all flights scheduled for Tuesday were scrapped and customers won\u2019t be able to use accommodation they booked. Despite yesterday\u2019s collapse, Thomas Cook workers have been turning up to work today. They\u2019ll be assisting the Official Receiver, which was appointed to liquidate the company on Monday. Back in the markets, sterling is lurching around after the Supreme Court dramatically ruled against Boris Johnson, over the prorogation of parliament. In a seismic ruling, the UK\u2019s top judges have concluded that the suspension of parliament was \u2018unlawful, void and of no effect\u2019. This sent the pound rocketing back towards $1.25 (a level hit last week), before subsiding back as traders wondered what happens next. Opposition MPs are calling for Johnson\u2019s resignation, as they digest the details of a stinging ruling from the Supreme Court: Labour MP Justin Madders has hit out at travel companies who have hiked their prices following Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse. He says a constituent is facing a 500% price hike to reschedule their honeymoon to Mexico. Obviously there is a supply-and-demand issue at present, but companies should be wary of price-gouging.... Sam Jones, who is in Mallorca, has this update on flights from Palma airport. Eight flights are due to bring Thomas Cook customers home to the UK from Palma airport in Mallorca today. Some have been rerouted, while others are set to leave as previously scheduled: The 10.25 to Stansted is currently set to take off as originally planned, as is the 10.35 to Bristol, the 10.45 to Manchester, the 11.10 to East Midlands, and the 11.30 to Cardiff. The 11am flight from Palma to Gatwick is due to take off 15 minutes early, but will now land at Manchester. The 10.50 to Birmingham has been pushed back to 20.15 and will now land in Manchester. The 11am Palma-Newcastle flight has also been pushed back to 20.15 and will land in Manchester as well. The CAA says transfers will be provided to all those landing at rescheduled destinations. In other transport news, Uber has just been denied a new permanent licence to operate in London. Instead, Transport for London has instead given the ride-hailing firm only a two-month extension to its licence, which is due to expire on Wednesday night. It is the second time in two years that TfL has rejected Uber\u2019s application for a full operating licence, following concerns it doesn\u2019t meet its \u201cfit and proper\u201d test. Here\u2019s the full story: Large queues are forming at Reus Airport near Tarragona, in Spain. But there\u2019s good news for passengers -- the CAA expects to replace all three scheduled Thomas Cook flights, on time, today. Large queues are forming at Mallorca airport in Parma, as Thomas Cook customers try to get onto one of today\u2019s eight repatriation flights: British government officials are there to help, wearing bright yellow high-visibility vests: Business secretary Andrea Leadsom has claimed it would have been a \u201cwaste of taxpayers\u2019 money\u201d to have bailed out Thomas Cook. Speaking on Sky News, Leadsom says the company\u2019s collapse is \u201cincredibly sad\u201d. She\u2019s \u201cso sorry\u201d for those who have lost their jobs or why are trying to get home. We want to look into how this happened, which is why the Insolvency Service has been asked to fast-track its usual investigation into its directors, to see if anything could have been done differently to \u201cavert this disaster\u201d, Leadsom continues. Q: There\u2019s a backlash against the pay received by Thomas Cook\u2019s bosses. Do you and the PM now favour restricting pay and bonuses? Leadsom says the government is \u201cconcerned to understand\u201d how a business could build up a huge amount of debt, leaving it teetering for some time, with a business model that doesn\u2019t seem to meet customer needs. I do want to see what the Insolvency Service has to say about the events leading to the collapse of Thomas Cook. Leadsom adds that we must \u201cdo more to align directors\u2019 pay to performance\u201d. There\u2019s lots we can do, but the situation is already better than a decade ago. Q: Isn\u2019t this just posturing? These companies are pursuing the free market policies the Conservative Party supports. We\u2019ve done a huge amount on corporate government already to make boards more accountable, Leadsom hits back. Directors of boards who are earning significant sums need to be accountable for the performance of the businesses they run We will look to see what more needs to be done to make them accountable. But... these will need consultation, before any legislation is drawn up. These things take time, and the government doesn\u2019t want to hurt businesses. Q: What about these reports that Turkish and Spanish governments were ready to step in with \u00a3200m, but UK refused to provide guarantees to underwrite the funding? There are all sorts of rumours flying around, says Leadsom. The fact is that \u00a3200m is an underestimate of what TC needed, even for the short term, she claims, adding: It would have been a waste of taxpayers\u2019 money to throw good money after bad. This is a very sad case, she concludes. As a reminder.... Thomas Cook was trying to execute a recovery plan that would have wiped out \u00a31.7bn of existing debts and injected an extra \u00a3900m of new funding into the company -- half from Chinese tourism business Fosun, the rest by a mixture of banks and hedge funds . That plan floundered when lenders asked for an extra \u00a3200m to tide the company over. The row over Thomas Cook\u2019s \u2018fat cat\u2019 pay dominated today\u2019s newspapers, from across the spectrum. The Daily Mail reckons senior bosses at Thomas Cook \u201cpocketed a \u00a347million pay bonanza as the firm headed for the rocks\u201d. That includes the \u00a336m paid to its three CEOs since 2007 (as we reported overnight), plus millions more to other officials The Mirror has also taken a swipe at the \u201cgreedy bosses\u201d, with shadow chancellor John McDonnell saying: They have a moral responsibility to return their bonuses. They created this mess and there are large numbers of people losing their jobs. [Bosses] should hand the money back to compensate those workers.\u201d The Financial Times says those executives can expect scrutiny: Thomas Cook\u2019s management will be investigated by a UK government-backed probe into the travel group\u2019s collapse, as holidaymakers flooded international airports on Monday to queue for rescue flights. The full cost of the demise of the world\u2019s oldest tour operator is still being assessed by restructuring specialists AlixPartners, with investors lining up to cherry-pick the best parts of its pan-European operations after the failure of last-ditch talks to secure a \u00a31.1bn rescue deal. The Times leads on Boris Johnson\u2019s criticism of Thomas Cook\u2019s management, questioning whether they should receive such huge packages when a firm can go \u2018down the tubes\u2019. Nearly 1,000 British tourists left Turkey\u2019s southwestern Mugla province yesterday, following Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse. Many left after nightfall,and were clearly pleased to be heading home. An additional 3,000 tourists are expected to leave today. The boss of travel company Tui said it would fly home Tui customers who are booked on Thomas Cook flights. Friedrich Joussen, the chief executive, told shareholders this morning: Tui is preparing measures to support. Where Tui customers are booked on Thomas Cook Airlines flights and these are no longer operated, replacement flights will be offered. \u201cWe are currently assessing the short term impact of Thomas Cook\u2019s insolvency under the current circumstances, on the final week of our 2019 financial result. Tui also warned that the market remained tough due to the grounding of 737 Max aircraft, airline overcapacity and continued Brexit uncertainty. Shares in TUI have jumped 1.4% in early trading, having surged 7% on Monday. Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse should let TUI win more business, and potentially push up prices too. Over at Palma airport, the CAA is planning to run eight flights back to the UK. Two of them, though, are scheduled to leave around nine hours late, meaning passengers face a grim day at the airport. They\u2019ll both also land at Manchester, not Birmingham and Newcastle as expected \u2013- meaning passengers will be put onto a coach and transferred to their original destination. The boss of the Civil Aviation Authority says Operation Matterhorn, the repatriation of Thomas Cook customers, has had some difficulties - but overall is going well. Speaking on BBBC Breakfast, Dame Deirdre Hutton said: \u201cIt\u2019s a two-week operation, that\u2019s mainly because people go on holiday for two weeks, so we want everybody to continue to enjoy their holidays and we\u2019ll bring them back on the day they were going to come back anyway.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m really pleased that the first day went well, we got back 95% of those we were intending. There were some operational difficulties and we\u2019ll continue to have that ... there\u2019ll be some bumps in the road and if people could bear with us, but we have got off to a reasonable start which is very good.\u201d There\u2019s nobody abroad who should have been home. We\u2019re bringing people back when their holiday ends, so we\u2019ve got another 135,000 people to bring....We\u2019ve done 8% so far, we\u2019ve got 13 days to go, so it\u2019s still a big operation.\u201d We heard yesterday that around 30 holidaymakers in Tunisia were sent back to their hotels, because there wasn\u2019t enough space for them on the repatriation flight. There were also long queues and delays at airports such as Mah\u00f3n, Menorca and Palma, Mallorca, in the Balearic Islands. The Civil Aviation Authority has just announced that it brought 14,700 Thomas Cook customers back to the UK on Monday. It is planning to run another 74 flights today, which should transport another 16,800 passengers at the end of their holidays. However, some passengers will not be landing where they expected. For example, flight MT1217 was due to land at Gatwick, but is instead being sent to Manchester. That means a long coach ride down to London to complete the journey. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The management of Thomas Cook are facing serious questions over the pay today, after the world\u2019s oldest tour operator collapsed \u2013 triggering Britain\u2019s biggest ever peacetime repatriation. As the first planes brought thousands of holidaymakers back to the UK, with heavy delays at some airports, accusations of \u201cfat cat\u201d incompetence rained down on the company. Boris Johnson led the criticism, questioning why business leaders get away with paying themselves \u201clarge sums of money\u201d as their business goes \u201cdown the tubes\u201d. Speaking in New York, at the UN climate summit, the PM said: \u201cI think it is a bit bewildering that you can have 160,000 people stranded. \u201cIt\u2019s not possible for me to know exactly what happened with the directors of the board of Thomas Cook and how it came about when they paid themselves x, y or z. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got to have a system in the future whereby we make sure that tour operators are in some way prevented from simply going belly up and then requiring the taxpayer to bring everybody home.\u201d Estimates vary, but we\u2019ve calculated that the three executives who led Thomas Cook over the last 12 years earned around \u00a335m between them. Manny Fontenla-Novoa, who led the acquisition spree that saddled the company with more than \u00a31bn of debt, was handed more than \u00a317m in just over four years as boss of Thomas Cook, boosted by bonuses awarded for slashing 2,800 jobs following the merger with MyTravel. He quit in 2011 as the tour operator came close to collapse. His successor was Harriet Green, who was paid \u00a34.7m for less than three years plus a share bonus worth a further \u00a35.6m. She handed a third of that award to charities after the deaths of two children from carbon monoxide poisoning in Thomas Cook accommodation in Corfu. Green also claimed \u00a380,000 a year to cover her hotel bills at the five-star Brown\u2019s hotel in London, where she lived during the week. Peter Fankhauser, who was in charge when the company collapsed, was handed \u00a38.3m, including \u00a34.3m in bonuses. The government has already ordered a probe into the firm\u2019s collapse, so the Insolvency Service will examine why Thomas Cook collapsed in a mountain of debt, and whether directors are to blame. Johnson and colleagues are also facing criticism, though, after refusing to help Thomas Cook by handing it a \u00a3200m lifeline. Some argue that this wouldn\u2019t have addressed the company\u2019s problems, but it appears to have scuppered rescue efforts led by Spain and Turkey. Meanwhile, Civil Aviation Authority staff will continue to mobilise planes to get Thomas Cook\u2019s customers home \u2013 with around 150,000 holidaymakers abroad yesterday when the firm sunk. They\u2019ve all been promised they\u2019ll be brought home, but it could be a tricky process \u2013 with plenty of delays and confusion reported yesterday. Also coming up today While Thomas Cook customers trudge home, City traders will be watching the supreme court which will rule whether Boris Johnson misled the Queen to suspend parliament.

In 2015 he addressed the party still not quite believing he had been elected leader, and with MPs horrified by what had happened. In 2017 he was giddy with success, having done well in a general election that was expected to finish him off. But this year he addressed a party more Corbynite than ever before, as yesterday\u2019s vote showed, with a policy offer more leftwing and radical than ever before, and facing a Tory party looking more divided and chaotic than ever before. The obstacles to Corbyn becoming prime minister are still formidable - read John Curtice on the subject at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/24/brexit-supreme-court-latest-news-labour-conference-starmer-says-it-is-obvious-labour-will-back-remain-despite-conference-vote-live-news?page=with:block-5d89cbc58f08f30dc5bc137b#block-5d89cbc58f08f30dc5bc137b\">9.25am </a>- but the Labour leader could be forgiven for wallowing in the positives for 45 minutes.</p> \n  <p>This was reportedly a shorter speech than planned, and it did feel as if some newsy chunks with announcements had been cut out at the last minute and saved for another day. But that was obviously the right thing to do in the light of the supreme court announcements. Corbyn\u2019s attack on Johnson was robust, but did not shed much light on the parliamentary tactics that Labour will adopt in the coming days. His account of how he would govern for the 99% was fine as far as it went, but he did not say anything about his approach to government that he has not said before. The most interesting passage was the one that contained the one announcement in the speech, plans for a quasi-socialisation of the pharmaceutical industry. Labour has just released <a href=\"http://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Medicines-For-The-Many.pdf\">a detailed 52-page document (pdf)</a> with full details. Corbyn himself is not one of parliament\u2019s great policy experts, but if you look, you will find that in many areas his party now has a detailed blueprint for transformative change.

The Lib Dems don\u2019t want to make Jeremy Corbyn PM, and there is no support at the moment for anyone else to lead an interim government.</p> \n  <p>Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, there would be 14 days after a vote of no confidence to allow time for another government to win a confidence vote. During that period Johnson would remain as PM. Assuming no other PM emerged, after 9 October parliament would be dissolved pending an election. Under electoral law there would have to be 25 working days before polling day which would mean an election in November.</p> \n  <p>Theoretically the Benn Act means that, if the UK is heading for a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, Boris Johnson would have to request an extension. But Johnson has signalled that he wants to find a way around this, and even if he puts in a request, it is not certain that the EU will say yes.</p> \n  <p>In short, if the opposition passed a vote of no confidence now, there would be some risk of a no-deal Brexit on 31 October.</p> \n  <p><strong>Why hasn\u2019t Boris Johnson resigned already?</strong></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/133530707\"> \n   <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> \n    <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> \n     <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2577389\" title=\"View HiFlight\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/2577389\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for HiFlight\"> </a> \n    </div> \n    <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> \n     <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> \n      <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2577389\" title=\"View HiFlight\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">HiFlight</span> </a> \n     </div> \n     <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> \n      <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/133530707\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">24 September 2019 2:19pm</a> \n     </div> \n     <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n      <p>Andrew</p> \n      <p>Can someone please explain why Johnson has a choice in whether to resign or stay?</p> \n      <p>Looking back on some of the reasons senior ministers or PMs have gone are relatively trivial compared to the way Johnson has behaved, and yet he refuses to resign and intends to plough on. </p> \n      <p>Is there no way one of the men in dark suits could approach him and tell him to b*gg*r off?</p>\n     </div> \n    </div> \n   </div> \n  </figure> \n  <p>It is not that unusual for the courts to decide that ministers have acted unlawfully \u2013 under judicial review, it happens all the time \u2013 but it is rare to read a court judgment as damning as today\u2019s. You are right to say that some ministers have resigned over matters that are far more trivial. But ministers go when they have lost the confidence of the prime minister. The PM only goes if he or she loses the confidence of the electorate (in a general election), their party or the House of Commons. Tory MPs still support Johnson (and, even if they didn\u2019t, the 1922 Committee quietly agreed a new rule recently ruling out a leadership challenge until Johnson has been in post for a year). And, as for losing the confidence of the Commons, see the answer above.</p> \n  <p><strong>Who would be Tory leader if Johnson resigned?</strong></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/133530331\"> \n   <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> \n    <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> \n     <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/18048476\" title=\"View Komornik\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/18048476\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for Komornik\"> </a> \n    </div> \n    <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> \n     <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> \n      <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/18048476\" title=\"View Komornik\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">Komornik</span> </a> \n     </div> \n     <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> \n      <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/133530331\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">24 September 2019 2:14pm</a> \n     </div> \n     <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n      <p>ANDREW: Is it feasible for Parliament to make a Humble Petition to the Queen to request that Johnson step down from his office?

If they wanted to remove him, a no-confidence vote is the mechanism available.</p> \n  <p>But your question does raise the question of who might take over if Johnson were to resign (which he says he won\u2019t). There is no deputy Tory leader, or deputy prime minister. Dominic Raab is first secretary of state as well as foreign secretary, which makes him Johnson\u2019s de facto deputy. But, unlike other first secretaries of state, he is outranked by the chancellor, Sajid Javid, in the cabinet\u2019s pecking order. (Ministers are ranked <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/ministers\">in the official list</a> in order of seniority.) In practice, if Johnson were to go, he and colleagues would have to agree who to recommend go the Queen as interim PM, pending a Conservative leadership election. Given that the Conservative party is now a firmly pro-Brexit party, and Javid voted remain, it probably would be Raab.</p> \n  <p><em>UPDATE: </em>See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/24/brexit-supreme-court-latest-news-labour-conference-starmer-says-it-is-obvious-labour-will-back-remain-despite-conference-vote-live-news?page=with:block-5d8a36328f0834740f3c1698#block-5d8a36328f0834740f3c1698\">4.32pm</a> for an alternative view.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-24T17:37:24.662Z\">at 6.37pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d8a26b48f08f9df5bdda91c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-24T14:23:03.846Z\">3.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s speech is now scheduled to start at 4.30pm.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d8a22fa8f0834740f3c1595\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-24T14:22:25.424Z\">3.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>From Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BethRigby/status/1176497743969345542\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">And in case you\u2019re wondering, I hear that the prime minister is absolutely furious about all of this.

Boris Johnson could not try to prorogue parliament again for a lengthy period without effectively being in contempt of court. It is also possible that, faced with such a transparently illegal request, the Queen could say no \u2013 or at least threaten to (although this would involve the crown getting involved in politics in a way that has not happened for a century or more). But the judgment does allow a normal prorogation \u2013 one, at this time of year, that would last a few days ahead of a Queen\u2019s speech.

But we don\u2019t know what he said to her in private about his plans \u2013 and of course she won\u2019t say anything about that either. The Queen has got more inside knowledge of British politics than anyone alive, and it is safe to assume that she knew exactly what he was up to when he was requesting this prorogation. She may feel that the royal prerogative has been abused (it has).

Some of the briefing from Number 10 suggests he already wants to bypass the Benn Act intended to force him to request a Brexit delay if no deal has been passed by 19 October, and now there may be some in Downing Street considering how he can sidestep this judgment. We don\u2019t know what would happen if he did, although <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/boris-johnson-warned-he-could-be-jailed-if-he-delays-brexit/\">a former DPP has said Johnson could ultimately be jailed for contempt of court.</a></p> \n  <p>What is more likely is that, if Johnson were to try to defy the law, parts of government and the civil service would go on strike.

Parliament, and in particular the House of Commons as the elected representatives of the people, has a right to a voice in how that change comes about. The effect upon the fundamentals of our democracy was extreme.</p> \n   <p>No justification for taking action with such an extreme effect has been put before the court. The only evidence of why it was taken is the memorandum from Nikki da Costa of 15 August. This explains why holding the Queen\u2019s speech to open a new session of parliament on 14th October would be desirable. It does not explain why it was necessary to bring parliamentary business to a halt for five weeks before that, when the normal period necessary to prepare for the Queen\u2019s speech is four to six days. It does not discuss the difference between prorogation and recess. It does not discuss the impact of prorogation on the special procedures for scrutinising the delegated legislation necessary to achieve an orderly withdrawal from the European Union, with or without a withdrawal agreement, on 31 October. It does not discuss what parliamentary time would be needed to secure parliamentary approval for any new withdrawal agreement, as required by section 13 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018. </p> \n   <p>The court is bound to conclude, therefore, that the decision to advise Her Majesty to prorogue parliament was unlawful because it had the effect of frustrating or preventing the ability of parliament to carry out its constitutional functions without reasonable justification. </p> \n   <p>The next and final question, therefore, is what the legal effect of that finding is and therefore what remedies the court should grant. The court can certainly declare that the advice was unlawful. The Inner House went further and declared that any prorogation resulting from it was null and of no effect. The government argues that the Inner House could not do that because the prorogation was a \u201cproceeding in parliament\u201d which, under the Bill of Rights of 1688 cannot be impugned or questioned in any court. But it is quite clear that the prorogation is not a proceeding in parliament. It takes place in the House of Lords chamber in the presence of members of both houses, but it is not their decision. It is something which has been imposed upon them from outside. It is not something on which members can speak or vote. It is not the core or essential business of parliament which the Bill of Rights protects. Quite the reverse: it brings that core or essential business to an end. </p> \n   <p>This court has already concluded that the prime minister\u2019s advice to Her Majesty was unlawful, void and of no effect. This means that the order in council to which it led was also unlawful, void and of no effect and should be quashed. This means that when the royal commissioners walked into the House of Lords it was as if they walked in with a blank sheet of paper. The prorogation was also void and of no effect. Parliament has not been prorogued. This is the unanimous judgment of all 11 justices.</p> \n   <p>It is for parliament, and in particular the Speaker and the Lord Speaker to decide what to do next. Unless there is some parliamentary rule of which we are unaware, they can take immediate steps to enable each house to meet as soon as possible. It is not clear to us that any step is needed from the prime minister, but if it is, the court is pleased that his counsel have told the court that he will take all necessary steps to comply with the terms of any declaration made by this court.</p> \n   <p> It follows that the advocate general\u2019s appeal in the case of Cherry is dismissed and Mrs Miller\u2019s appeal is allowed. The same declarations and orders should be made in each case.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n   <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"2198424b-18de-4bee-8e9b-ef4b29588dd9\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZP0ZSe0DXk4?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-24T10:16:11.847Z\">at 11.16am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d89e62f8f0834740f3c124f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-24T09:48:13.031Z\">10.48am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here is <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2019-0192-summary.pdf\">a summary of the judgment (pdf).</a></p> \n  <p>And here is<a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2019-0192-judgment.pdf\"> the full text (pdf).</a></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d89e50c8f0834740f3c1247\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-24T09:45:52.682Z\">10.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Hale says prorogation 'unlawful, void and of no effect'</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Hale says prorogation is not a proceeding in parliament.</p> \n  <p>Although it takes place in parliament, it is not their decision.

But on the Today programme this morning the leading elections expert <strong>Prof Sir John Curtice</strong> said it was hard to see how a compromise strategy would succeed. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There is no doubt that the Labour party faces the challenge: how does it keep the coalition [of remain voters and leave voters] it has together. But at the end of the day the arithmetic doesn\u2019t lie. For every one voter who voted Labour and leave, there were two in 2017 who voted remain.</p> \n   <p>And the difficulty about believing that Labour\u2019s latest variation of its compromise designed to appeal to both groups is going to work is that the party has lost ground heavily among remainers and among leavers. It lost that ground such that by the end of May it was only running at about 25% in the polls across the electorate as a whole. There is no evidence at all of any recovery in that figure. And so therefore it is not clear why yet another compromise \u2013 a compromise that looks unlikely to appeal to either Labour remainers or Labour leavers - is actually going to succeed in repairing the damage.</p> \n   <p>Remember, around two-thirds of those people who are Labour leavers say that actually their preferred policy is Boris Johnson\u2019s policy of just: let\u2019s get out by 31 October. Meanwhile Labour remain voters are, if anything, closer to Jo Swinson\u2019s view, let\u2019s just revoke article 50 and wanting another referendum. So how either of these groups is going to get attracted back by the policy is not immediately obvious. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Curtice said that it was generally assumed that politicians need to be in the centre ground to win, and that Corbyn is often seen as extreme. But on Brexit, Curtice said, Corbyn was in the centre \u2013 when, on this issue, the extreme views were more popular.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>On a subject where the centre ground is very thinly populated - the two most popular options are either leaving without a deal or let\u2019s just revoke article 50 - on this issue where actually being one of the extreme positions seems to be more electorally popular, Jeremy Corbyn, the supposed radical of British politics, has chosen to be the last compromiser.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Curtice said that support for Labour fell heavily in the spring, when its compromise Brexit position was facing strong criticism. He admitted that it was possible for the party to win back the support it had lost. But he said that it was not easy to see how it would win back support from the Lib Dems and the Greens given its Brexit policy. And he said that Corbyn\u2019s general approval ratings were a problem too.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The risk with [Corbyn\u2019s Brexit policy] is that, as a result, he gives the impression of being a ditherer and lacking leadership. Whether it\u2019s what people think about Jeremy Corbyn in general, or about how he\u2019s been handling Brexit in particular, the numbers are very poor indeed. </p> \n   <p>In fact Ipsos Mori, <a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/jeremy-corbyn-has-lowest-leadership-satisfaction-rating-any-opposition-leader-1977\">in their most recent poll</a>, actually recorded last week, in terms of the level of satisfaction with Jeremy Corbyn in general, the worst figure for any opposition leader since Ipsos Mori started polling in 1977. The days when Jeremy Corbyn was popular ... for the time being at least are very much behind us.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-24T08:34:43.775Z\">at 9.34am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d89b9d78f08f30dc5bc1321\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-24T07:36:21.703Z\">8.36am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Starmer says it is 'obvious' Labour will back remain despite conference vote</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Yesterday the Labour party voted to postpone any decision about how it might campaign in a second referendum on Brexit until after the general election, and after the renegotiation planned by Jeremy Corbyn if he wins. But if anyone thought that was the last word on the matter, they were mistaken. Shortly afterwards, speaking <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/keir-starmer-disappointed-by-labours-rejection-of-firm-remain-stance/\">at a fringe event organised by Politico Europe</a>, <strong>Sir Keir Starmer,</strong> the shadow Brexit secretary, implied that the vote did not matter much because it was \u201cobvious\u201d where Labour would end up. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I have got a pretty clear idea of where the members are on this and therefore I think it is very likely that the members will want us to campaign for remain. We campaigned for remain in 2016, we are currently campaigning for remain against any Tory outcome, and it seems to me obvious where the membership is on this.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Starmer also said he had \u201cmixed feelings\u201d about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/17/corbyn-vows-to-put-sensible-brexit-deal-to-voters-in-referendum\">the hints from Jeremy Corbyn that he might remain neutral in a second referendum.</a></p> \n  <p>Today the Labour conference is focusing on the climate emergency. As my colleague <strong>Fiona Harvey </strong>reports, the party has announced plans to build dozens of new state-owned offshore windfarms ahead of a debate on a proposal for the UK to have a target of cutting net carbon emissions to zero by 2030 - an idea dismissed as impossible by trade unions. Here is Fiona\u2019s story.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/24/labour-unveils-83bn-state-windfarms-plan-before-key-climate-vote\">Labour unveils \u00a383bn state windfarms plan before key climate vote</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>But events at the Labour conference will probably be overshadowed by an announcement from the supreme court in London, which will declare whether or not Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend (prorogue) parliament for five weeks was lawful. The government effectively argued that this was a political decision and that it none of the court\u2019s business. Perhaps the court will accept this argument, but many legal observers think it won\u2019t, and so the judgment could have a lasting effect on the constitution, constraining an important power currently available to the PM. (Johnson was able to prorogue using the royal prerogative - a process that allows the PM to take decisions alone, without consulting parliament.) More immediately, the judgment could lead to parliament being reconvened this week (although <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/sep/19/brexit-news-latest-supreme-court-john-major-tells-supreme-court-it-would-be-naive-to-believe-boris-johnsons-prorogation-claims-live-news?page=with:block-5d8394168f0834740f3be5dc#block-5d8394168f0834740f3be5dc\">lawyers are divided on how this would or could happen).</a> Jeremy Corbyn has already said that, if MPs go back early, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/22/labour-conference-latest-news-jeremy-corbyn-calls-for-party-to-have-two-deputy-leaders-live-news?page=with:block-5d8738da8f08f30dc5bc00ec#block-5d8738da8f08f30dc5bc00ec\">the first thing the opposition parties will do will be try to pass a move to stop Johnson proroguing again.</a></p> \n  <p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> \n  <p><em>10.10am: </em>Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, speaks at the Labour conference at the start of a debate covering the green new deal and corporate governance.<br></p> \n  <p><em>10.30am: </em>The supreme court delivers its judgment on whether Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue (suspend) parliament for five weeks was lawful.</p> \n  <p><em>12.25pm: </em>Sue Hayman, the shadow environment secretary, speaks at the Labour conference.</p> \n  <p><em>2.15pm: </em>Tom Watson, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, speaks at the conference.</p> \n  <p>As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web.

Johnson faced widespread calls to resign over the historic ruling. The prime minister was forced to call the monarch from UN general assembly, in New York, and to bat away suggestions he should step down. Pressure also mounted on the attorney general and on the prime minister\u2019s senior aides. Those who advised Johnson that the lengthy suspension of parliament would be both lawful and wise came under intense scrutiny themselves, including from hard Brexit supporters. Johnson agreed to respect the supreme court\u2019s decision, while saying he disagreed with it. Johnson also indicated that he wanted to go ahead with a Queen\u2019s speech, which would require another prorogation. But a No 10 source criticised the judges and there were reports a government minister had accused them of mounting a \u201ccoup\u201d. A Downing Street source said the supreme court had made \u201ca serious mistake in extending its reach to these political matters\u201d, before an aide travelling with Johnson in the US was forced to distance the prime minister from those comments. It was reported later that the Commons leader had made similarly combative comments to the cabinet. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, addressed the party\u2019s annual conference. He attacked the prime minister and committed Labour to \u2013 among other things \u2013 setting up a publicly owned drugs company to supply cheap versions of drugs for the NHS. Parliament is due to reconvene on Wednesday after the Speaker called MPs back. Rees-Mogg is due to set out the business of the house in the morning and MPs are queuing up to have their voices heard. If you\u2019d like to read yet more, my colleagues Heather Stewart, Peter Walker and Rowena Mason have the full story: The Commons leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg, told fellow government ministers that the supreme court judgment amounts to a \u201cconstitutional coup\u201d, according to media reports. The BBC, the Financial Times and the Daily Mail all report that Rees-Mogg made the comments during a conference call with cabinet colleagues this evening. Boris Johnson spoke to the Queen after today\u2019s court ruling, a government official has said, declining to give any no more details. Johnson is due to arrive in London at around lunchtime tomorrow, following an overnight flight. However, a government official with the prime minister in New has said it was impossible to say whether the prime minister would appear before the Commons. I would anticipate there would be statements to the house, I\u2019m just not in a position to say what they will be on. Amid a continued backlash over the verdict, the official said Johnson still had full confidence in the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, and the senior No 10 aide, Dominic Cummings. Asked if Johnson would use words like that, the official in New York said: \u201cI haven\u2019t. And nor has the prime minister.\u201d After a conference call of the full cabinet, chaired by Johnson in New York ahead of his speech to the UN general assembly later in the evening, Downing Street gave no indications over what the prime minister would do next. They said the leader of the Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, would set out the planned government business first thing tomorrow. Another official said that, while it was confirmed the Conservative party conference would take place next week as planned, it had not been decided whether it was necessary to pass a motion seeking a recess for the period, as is traditional. It has not been ruled out, but nor has it been ruled in. A Labour government will work towards a net-zero carbon emissions target by 2030. Delegates have backed a motion at the party conference, despite opposition from some trade unions. They have voted in favour of the \u201cLabour\u2019s Socialist Green New Deal\u201d motion and have backed a separate motion calling for a \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d that does not make reference to any dates for decarbonisation. Speaking after the motion passed, Laura Parker, a spokeswoman for Momentum, said the plan would create \u201ctens of thousands of good, green jobs across the country\u201d. It will usher in a new era of public luxury for all and welcome climate refugees who have been forced from their homes. In the face of a monumental crisis, we must be bold and ambitious. We are the last generation who can stop climate breakdown and build a society that works for the many. And now Labour has a plan to do just that. The US congresswoman, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, praised the move. Responding for the government, the business secretary Andrea Leadsom said: With even Labour-backing unions admitting this plan is completely unworkable and would threaten jobs, it\u2019s clear Labour aren\u2019t serious about tackling climate change. Labour\u2019s plans to renationalise huge swathes of the energy system would scare away the investment that is so vital for reducing emissions while leaving the taxpayer to pick up the huge cost. While Labour talk, Conservatives have been taking action. We have a realistic target to end our contribution to global warming by 2050 and we\u2019re making good progress towards achieving it - reducing emissions by a quarter since 2010 and increasing the use of renewables to record levels. Here\u2019s a little more on the comments from the Irish taoiseach, who has said he and Boris Johnson reached \u201cno agreements by any means\u201d after their meeting in New York. Leo Varadkar said he \u201cgot into some more details\u201d with Johnson during the meeting on Tuesday, but stressed nothing concrete had been agreed. We are very keen that there be a deal, that the UK should be able to leave the European Union in an orderly fashion. That\u2019s in Ireland\u2019s interest, it\u2019s in Britain\u2019s interest too. But there are certain guarantees that we expect to be honoured; that there won\u2019t be a hard border between North and South.... that North-South cooperation will continue as envisaged by the Good Friday Agreement, that what was given to us by the British government back in December 2017. Johnson added: \u201cIt certainly will.\u201d Later, a Downing Street spokesperson said: The prime minister met with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar at the UN General Assembly today. They discussed the Brexit talks and the ideas that the UK has been putting forward, including on the issue of consent. The prime minister was clear that the UK would be leaving on 31 October and said that he was cautiously optimistic that we would be able to do so through negotiating a deal which is acceptable to both sides. The prime minister underlined his steadfast commitment to the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement and said that we will never place infrastructure, checks or controls at the border. They agreed on the vital importance of ensuring the peace, prosperity and security of Northern Ireland. The leaders agreed to stay in close contact in coming days. In New York Boris Johnson has held a bilateral meeting with Donald Trump at the UN meeting in New York. Asked if he would resign for misleading the Queen in the first media question of the meeting, Johnson replied: As I said earlier on, let\u2019s be absolutely clear. We respect the judiciary in our country, we respect the court. I disagree profoundly with what they had to say. I think it was entirely right to go ahead with a plan for a Queen\u2019s speech. Frankly we need to get on with Brexit. After the PM was questioned about resigning, Trump said: I\u2019ll tell you, I know him well, he\u2019s not going anywhere. Johnson added: \u201cNo, no, no.\u201d Trump also rebuked the reporter who asked whether the PM would resign, saying: \u201cThat was a very nasty question from a great American reporter.\u201d But Johnson added: \u201cI think he was asking a question, to be fair, that a lot of British reporters would\u2019ve asked.\u201d Trump said his reaction to the supreme court judgment was to tell the PM \u201cit\u2019s just another day in the office\u201d. Trump also cited victories of his own in the US supreme court in an effort to reassure the PM. He said: We won the wall, we won asylum, we\u2019ve won some of the biggest ones, we\u2019ve had a great streak going. We\u2019ve won a lot of decisions and I\u2019m sure that will happen to you. Johnson added: Well we are not counting our chickens and we\u2019re full of respect, as I say, to the justice system ... We\u2019re going to respect what the court had to say but we\u2019re going to get on and deliver Brexit. Trump also said that Johnson was \u201cdoing a really good job\u201d and that he was going to make \u201creally great progress in October and November\u201d. \u201cOctober,\u201d Johnson insisted, referring to his Brexit deadline. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is taking over now. Jeremy Corbyn will return to London on Tuesday evening and and on Wednesday Labour will use \u201cwhatever mechanisms there are to try and hold the prime minister to account\u201d in parliament, Corbyn\u2019s spokesman said. Boris Johnson has been meeting Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach (prime minister), in New York, my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll reports. Downing Street\u2019s private comments about the supreme court are a lot more critical than anything that Boris Johnson (see 1.41pm) or the government (see 6.25pm) have been saying in public. These are from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg. David Gauke, the former Tory lord chancellor, who had the whip removed after rebelling over Brexit earlier this month, has condemned this briefing. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s spokesman said Labour would use every mechanism to bring about an early general election - but that a poll would be conditional on the government not using it to force a no-deal Brexit. The spokesman said: We will use every mechanism we can to bring about an early election and the only condition being that we need to ensure that they can\u2019t use that to force a crash-out of the European Union without a deal. Sky News has seen an unredacted version of the cabinet minute that was released to court during the prorogation hearing in Scotland saying Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, advised Boris Johnson that his five-week prorogation would be lawful. As Sky reports, the version released to court, the reference to the legal advice was redacted, but the unredacted version says: The attorney general said that his advice on the question of the law is that this was lawful and within the constitution.Any accusations of unlawfulness or constitutional outrage were motivated by political considerations. The proposal was compatible with the provisions of the NIEF [Northern Ireland Executive Formation] Act 2019. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, has suggested that Cox needs to \u201cconsider his position\u201d in the event of his advice turning out to be wrong. At the very least, Cox should make a statement to MPs and release the full legal advice, he said. In a statement the attorney general\u2019s office said: The government acted in good faith and in the belief that its approach was both lawful and constitutional. These are complex matters on which senior and distinguished lawyers have disagreed. The divisional court led by the lord chief justice agreed unanimously with the government\u2019s legal position, as did the outer house in Scotland. We are disappointed that in the end the supreme court took a different view. We respect the judgment of the supreme court. Labour sources are saying that the plans for the pharmaceutical industry announced by Jeremy Corbyn (see 5.01pm), involving making research funding conditional on firms providing cheaper drugs and the establishment of a publicly-run firm to produce generic medicines, will save the NHS money. They do not have costings. Here is an extract from Labour\u2019s Medicines for the Many policy document (pdf). Few injustices are as stark as the knowledge that a medicine exists to treat or cure a family member, but that the unaccountable greed of a corporation means they are denied it. With drug prices leaping from tens to hundreds of thousands of pounds per patient, these injustices are only going to become more common globally. Here in the UK this situation is placing the egalitarian, collective ethos of the NHS under unbearable strain ... The current market incentives used in drug development are a socially constructed tool, designed to serve the world\u2019s citizens. If they are no longer serving the greater good in their current form \u2013 indeed, if they are leading to patients dying without access to lifesaving treatments \u2013 then it is incumbent on us to rethink the current model. We need a pharmaceutical innovation system that catalyses the scientific capacity to achieve the status of an innovation nation here in the UK while supporting the kinds of south\u2013south technology transfers that will bring economic sustainability and opportunity. Most importantly, we need a health innovation model that safeguards our NHS, that protects patients, and underpins effective public services around the world to ensure they are able to deliver healthcare for all. That might not have been Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s best conference speech, but it may have been his most self-confident and best received. In 2015 he addressed the party still not quite believing he had been elected leader, and with MPs horrified by what had happened. In 2017 he was giddy with success, having done well in a general election that was expected to finish him off. But this year he addressed a party more Corbynite than ever before, as yesterday\u2019s vote showed, with a policy offer more leftwing and radical than ever before, and facing a Tory party looking more divided and chaotic than ever before. The obstacles to Corbyn becoming prime minister are still formidable - read John Curtice on the subject at 9.25am - but the Labour leader could be forgiven for wallowing in the positives for 45 minutes. This was reportedly a shorter speech than planned, and it did feel as if some newsy chunks with announcements had been cut out at the last minute and saved for another day. But that was obviously the right thing to do in the light of the supreme court announcements. Corbyn\u2019s attack on Johnson was robust, but did not shed much light on the parliamentary tactics that Labour will adopt in the coming days. His account of how he would govern for the 99% was fine as far as it went, but he did not say anything about his approach to government that he has not said before. The most interesting passage was the one that contained the one announcement in the speech, plans for a quasi-socialisation of the pharmaceutical industry. Labour has just released a detailed 52-page document (pdf) with full details. Corbyn himself is not one of parliament\u2019s great policy experts, but if you look, you will find that in many areas his party now has a detailed blueprint for transformative change. What voters will make of it, of course, remains to be seen. The Labour conference is now singing the Red Flag and Jerusalem, as is traditional at the end of conference. Corbyn is now on his peroration. Together, we can go beyond defending the gains made by previous generations. It\u2019s time we started building a country fit for the next generation. Where young people don\u2019t fear the future but look forward with confidence and hope. The tide is turning. The years of retreat and defeat are coming to an end. Together, we\u2019ll take on the privileged, and put the people in power. Thank you. Corbyn thanks his party for their support, his constituents (he says how much he has learned from them) and his wider family. He has a different view of leadership from others, he says. I have what might be considered a different view of leadership from the one people are used to. I do believe leaders should have strong principles that people can trust. But leaders must also listen and trust others to play their part. Because there are leaders in every community driving change. Many of them would never dream of calling themselves leaders, but they are. As an example, he cites a woman campaigning against damp in a block of flats. She may not think of herself as a leader, but she is. If the British people elect a Labour government in the coming election, I will be proud to be your prime minister. Because I will be a different kind of prime minister. Not there from a sense of born-to-rule entitlement. Certainly not there for some personal power trip. There because I want to put government on your side. To put power and wealth into your hands.There because I believe government should work for you. Corbyn says Labour stands for the 99%, while the Tories promote division. This Conservative government. as well as the far right. has fuelled division in our society. They\u2019ll blame people\u2019s problems on the migrant worker trying to make a better life. They\u2019ll blame it on the mum who\u2019s struggling on universal credit. They\u2019ll blame it on Muslims, on young people, on anyone but themselves and their backers, who benefit from a grossly unequal and rigged system. Labour will do the opposite. We will bring people together. A Labour government will transform our economy and communities. We stand not just for the 52% or the 48% but for the 99%. And he accuses Boris Johnson of racism. Dangerous and wrong-headed international interventions have also exacerbated community tensions at home. When Boris Johnson compared Muslim women to letterboxes or bank robbers, it wasn\u2019t a flippant comment, it was calculated to play on people\u2019s fears. Displays of racism, Islamophobia or antisemitism are not signs of strength, but of weakness. Corbyn criticises Boris Johnson for raising the prospect of British troops being sent to Saudi Arabia. So it really beggars belief that this week Boris Johnson is openly talking about sending troops to Saudi Arabia as part of the increasingly dangerous confrontation between Saudi Arabia and Iran, in an apparent bid to appease Donald Trump. Have we learned nothing? Time and again over the last two decades the British political and military establishment has made the wrong call on military intervention in the wider Middle East, spreading conflicts rather than settling them. We must not make those mistakes again. Under a Labour government, Britain will be a force for peace and international justice. Corbyn turns to the climate emergency. Bringing our emissions down to net zero won\u2019t happen by itself. It will only be possible with massive public investment in renewable energy and green technology. That\u2019s not a burden. It\u2019s an opportunity to kickstart a Green Industrial Revolution that will create hundreds of thousands of high-skill, high-wage unionised jobs as we triple solar power, double onshore wind and bring about a seven-fold increase in offshore wind projects. And that\u2019s why we announced today that the next Labour government will build three new battery plants in South Wales, in Stoke-on-Trent and Swindon. And he branches out to talk about the climate crisis in an international context. The climate and environmental emergency we all face is an issue of global security. We\u2019re seeing ice caps melting, coral reefs dissolving, wildfires in the Arctic Circle and Brazil\u2019s far-right leader, President Bolsonaro, fiddles while the Amazon burns. Real security doesn\u2019t come from belligerent posturing or reckless military interventions. It comes from international cooperation and diplomacy, and addressing the root causes of the threats we all face. Our foreign policy will be defined by our commitment to human rights and international justice, not enthusiasm for foreign wars that fuel \u2013 rather than combat \u2013 terrorism and insecurity. Corbyn says Labour would invest in Crossrail for the north, link up northern cities and restore bus services. Government should not adopt a passive approach to the economy, he says. For decades we\u2019ve been told the economy is beyond our control, an irresistible force that can lay waste to entire communities while we can only watch on, passive. But it\u2019s not true. With a serious industrial strategy and a radical Labour government, the economy can be a tool in our hands rather than the master of our fate. And with a government that\u2019s prepared to intervene we can prioritise the things that matter most. Corbyn says there is \u201cno more tinkering around the edges\u201d in Labour\u2019s ambition. Labour will get our economy working in every town city and region with a record investment blitz, and we\u2019ll boost the devolved budgets in Wales and Scotland. We\u2019ll upgrade our transport energy and broadband infrastructure with \u00a3250bn pounds of investment. And breathe new life into every community, with a further \u00a3250bn of capital for businesses and co-ops. Investment on a scale our country has never known, bringing good new jobs and fresh growth to where you live. Corbyn is explaining how Labour would pay for its plans. And when it comes to paying for our public services Labour will raise tax but only for the top five per cent. The Tories will cut taxes for highest paid. Labour will make the big corporations pay the tax they owe. The Tories will give them tax breaks. How can it be right that the largest companies and wealthiest individuals are being given tax cuts while at the other end mums are dads are missing meals so they can feed their kids? Shouldn\u2019t it be a source of shame that the United Nations - the United Nations - had to take our government to task this year over the shocking fact that 14 million people are living in poverty in the fifth richest country in the world? Let me quote directly from the UN report. It said: \u201cMuch of the glue that has held British society together since the Second World War has been deliberately removed and replaced with a harsh and uncaring ethos.\u201d Doesn\u2019t that sum up the Tories: a harsh and uncaring ethos? Corbyn turns to health. Government should provide a platform that allows everyone to reach their full potential. That\u2019s the principle behind the National Education Service that the next Labour government will create. Free education for everyone throughout life as a right not a privilege. No more university tuition fees. Free childcare and a new Sure Start programme. Free vocational and technical education. And free training for adults. Corbyn turns from generalities to a story about an individual. Yesterday I met Luis Walker, a wonderful nine-year-old boy. Luis is living with cystic fibrosis. Every day he needs at least four hours of treatment and is often in hospital keeping him from school and his friends. Luis\u2019s life could be very different with the aid of a medicine called Orkambi. But Luis is denied the medicine he needs because its manufacturer refuses to sell the drug to the NHS for an affordable price. Luis, and tens of thousands of others suffering from illnesses such as cystic fibrosis, hepatitis C and breast cancer are being denied life-saving medicines by a system that puts profits for shareholders before people\u2019s lives. Labour will tackle this. We will redesign the system to serve public health \u2013 not private wealth \u2013 using compulsory licensing to secure generic versions of patented medicines. We\u2019ll tell the drugs companies that if they want public research funding then they\u2019ll have to make their drugs affordable for all. And we will create a new publicly owned generic drugs manufacturer to supply cheaper medicines to our NHS, saving our health service money and saving lives. We are the party that created the NHS. Only Labour can be trusted with its future. Corbyn says Labour would create publicly owned drugs company to supply cheap versions of drugs for NHS. Corbyn says Labour will scrap the Tory Trade Union Act within its first 100 days in office. That gets a standing ovation. (Many of the delegates are trade unionists.) And he confirms plans to bring rail, mail, water and the national grid into public ownership, \u201cso the essential services that we all rely on are run by and for the public not for profit\u201d. Corbyn turns to pay and inequality. We live in a country where top chief executives now pocket in just two-and-a-half days what the average worker earns in a whole year, where Thomas Cook bosses were able to fill their pockets with unearned bonuses while their workers face redundancy and 150,000 holidaymakers are stranded because of their failure. We\u2019ve had the greatest slump in wages since the first steam trains were built. To share wealth, we need to share power. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do in government, with bold, radical measures such as giving the workforce a 10% stake in large companies, paying a dividend of up to \u00a3500 a year to every employee. We\u2019ll bring about the biggest extension of rights for workers our country has ever seen. We\u2019ll scrap zero-hours contracts; introduce a \u00a310 living wage \u2013 including for young people from the age of 16; give all workers equal rights from their first day in the job; take action on the gender, disability and ethnicity pay gaps; and introduce flexible working time for workers experiencing the menopause. It\u2019s Labour that will get more money into your pocket, rather than line the pockets of multimillionaires. And we will give people a democratic voice at work, allowing them to secure better terms and pay for themselves. The various policy statements all get loud cheers and rounds of applause. Corbyn says Boris Johnson and his allies are the establishment. In a shameless bid to turn reality on its head, Boris Johnson\u2019s born-to-rule Tories are now claiming to be the voice of the people. A political party that exists to protect the establishment is pretending to be anti-establishment. Johnson and his wealthy friends are not only on the side of the establishment; they are the establishment. They will never be on the side of the people when supporting the people might hit them and their super-rich sponsors where it hurts \u2013 in their wallets and offshore bank accounts. Corbyn promises \u201cthe biggest people-powered campaign\u201d the UK has ever seen. Let me send this message to Boris Johnson: if you still lead your party into an election we know your campaign will be swimming in cash. But we\u2019ve got something you haven\u2019t \u2013 people in their hundreds of thousands rooted in all communities and all age groups across Britain and we\u2019ll meet you head on with the biggest people-powered campaign this country has ever seen. And if we win, it will be the people who win. Corbyn turns to domestic policy. The coming election will be a once-in-a-generation chance for real change. A chance to kick out Boris Johnson\u2019s government of the privileged few and put wealth and power in the hands of the many. A chance to give our NHS, schools and police the money they need by asking those at the top to pay their fair share. A chance to take urgent action on the environment before it\u2019s too late for our children. Addressing the charge that Labour\u2019s Brexit deal is hard to explain, Corbyn says it is not complicated. Labour will end the Brexit crisis by taking the decision back to the people with the choice of a credible leave deal alongside remain. That\u2019s not complicated. Labour is a democratic party that trusts the people. After three and a half years of Tory Brexit failure and division, the only way we can settle this issue and bring people back together is by taking the decision out of the hands of politicians and letting the people decide. So, within three months of coming to power, a Labour government will secure a sensible deal based on the terms we have long advocated and discussed with the EU trade unions and businesses: a new customs union, a close single market relationship and guarantees of rights and protections. And, within six months of being elected, we will put that deal to a public vote alongside remain. And as a Labour prime minister I pledge to carry out whatever the people decide. Corbyn says only Labour is offering a referendum. Only a vote for Labour will deliver a public vote on Brexit. Only a Labour government will put the power back into the hands of the people. We can bring our country and our people together. Let\u2019s stop a no-deal Brexit and let the people decide. Corbyn says Johnson has no mandate for a no-deal Brexit. The prime minister has no mandate for a no-deal crash-out, which is opposed by a majority of the public. It would force up food prices, cause shortages of medicines and threaten peace in Northern Ireland, thus destroying the work of the Good Friday agreement. The battle over no deal isn\u2019t a struggle between those who want to leave the EU and those who want to remain. It\u2019s about a small rightwing group who are trying to hijack the referendum result to rip up our rights and protections to shift even more power and wealth to those at the top. No deal would mean a Trump deal, Corbyn says. Under the cover of no deal they want to sell off what\u2019s left of our public services, strip away the regulations that keep us safe while slashing corporate taxes even further. That would mean a race to the bottom in standards and workers\u2019 rights to create an offshore tax haven for the super-rich. And they want all of this locked in with a one-sided free trade deal that would put our country at the mercy of Donald Trump. That\u2019s why a no-deal Brexit is really a Trump-deal Brexit. That would be the opposite of taking back control. It would be handing our country\u2019s future to the US president and his America First policy. Of course, Trump is delighted to have a compliant British prime minister in his back pocket. A Trump-deal Brexit would mean US corporations getting the green light for a comprehensive takeover of our public services I am not prepared to stand by while our NHS is sacrificed on the altar of US big business or any other country\u2019s big business. Corbyn gets a huge round of applause when he says the NHS is not for sale. Corbyn says an election should take place as soon as no deal has been taken off the table. This crisis can only be settled with a general election. That election needs to take place as soon as this government\u2019s threat of a disastrous no deal is taken off the table. That condition is what MPs passed into law before Boris Johnson illegally closed down parliament. Corbyn continues his attack on Johnson. [Resigning] would make him the shortest serving British prime minister in history and rightly so. His is a born-to-rule government of the entitled who believe that the rules they set for everyone else don\u2019t apply to them. That\u2019s what today\u2019s supreme court judgment spells out with brutal clarity. There was no reason \u2013 \u201clet alone a good reason\u201d, the judges concluded \u2013 for the prime minister to have shut down parliament. conference. He thought he could do whatever he liked just as he always does. He thinks he\u2019s above us all. He is part of an elite that disdains democracy. He is not fit to be prime minister. Let me quote the supreme court\u2019s conclusion: \u201cUnlawful, null and of no effect and should be quashed\u201d \u2013 they\u2019ve got the prime minister down to a tee. Jeremy Corbyn says Boris Johnson tried to shut down parliament. But he failed. The prime minister acted illegally when he tried to shut down opposition to his reckless and disastrous plan to crash out of the European Union without a deal. But he has failed. He will never shut down our democracy or silence the voices of the people. The democracy that Boris Johnson describes as a \u201crigmarole\u201d will not be stifled and the people will have their say. Tomorrow, parliament will return. The government will be held to account for what it has done. Boris Johnson has been found to have misled the country. This unelected prime minister should now resign. Jeremy Corbyn is now starting his speech at the Labour conference. He was due to speak tomorrow at lunchtime, at the end of the conference, but he is speaking now because parliament is being reconvened tomorrow. David Howarth, a former Lib Dem MP and a professor of law at Cambridge University, has been in touch to say he thinks I was wrong to dismiss the prospects of a humble address being used by MPs to get rid of the prime minister. (See 3.37pm.) He writes: A humble address to ask the monarch to dismiss the prime minister is far from impossible. Fox\u2019s supporters moved similar motions against Pitt in 1784 for example. On that occasion, before the modern idea of confidence had firmed up, the King refused to dismiss Pitt and Pitt refused to resign, but it is difficult to see how a modern prime minister, at least one with a shred of honour, could stay on. Ian Blackford, the SNP\u2019s leader at Wesminster, has said that parliament \u201cmust remove\u201d Boris Johnson as PM if he does not resign. He told PA Media: The fact that we\u2019ve passed a law that stops the UK crashing out of the European Union and all that Boris has done is stop parliament doing its job. He\u2019s been thwarted in that, he must resign and if he doesn\u2019t resign then parliament has got to do that for him. Parliament must remove Boris Johnson as prime minister. Blackford said parliament had to be satisfied that the act designed to stop a no-deal Brexit on 31 October would be effective. He continued: Once we\u2019re satisfied that that is the case, then we need to have that motion of no confidence. But it has to come quickly. Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson\u2019s chief of staff, reportedly believes that if the courts find against the government in cases like this, that only boosts the opportunities for Johnson to campaign on a pro-Brexit \u201cpeople v the establishment\u201d platform - with the establishment being parliament and the courts. But, if this YouGov poll is anything to go by (and it might not be \u2013 it is only a snap poll, before people have had time to consider the implications in full) \u2013 on this one the public are siding with the supreme court, not Johnson. James Cleverly, the Conservative party chairman, has said his party\u2019s conference will go ahead regardless of the decision to reconvene parliament. David Gauke, one of the 21 Tory MPs who had the whip removed after voting against the government on Brexit earlier this month, has said he would not back a no-confidence vote in the government \u201cat this point\u201d. Here are some more questions from readers. Isn\u2019t a no-confidence vote now inevitable? No. Only the leader of the opposition can table a no confidence motion that has to be put to a vote, but other opposition parties, independent MPs and rebel Tories would only vote for one if they knew it would lead to a new government led by a PM they would find acceptable. The Lib Dems don\u2019t want to make Jeremy Corbyn PM, and there is no support at the moment for anyone else to lead an interim government. Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, there would be 14 days after a vote of no confidence to allow time for another government to win a confidence vote. During that period Johnson would remain as PM. Assuming no other PM emerged, after 9 October parliament would be dissolved pending an election. Under electoral law there would have to be 25 working days before polling day which would mean an election in November. Theoretically the Benn Act means that, if the UK is heading for a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, Boris Johnson would have to request an extension. But Johnson has signalled that he wants to find a way around this, and even if he puts in a request, it is not certain that the EU will say yes. In short, if the opposition passed a vote of no confidence now, there would be some risk of a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. Why hasn\u2019t Boris Johnson resigned already? It is not that unusual for the courts to decide that ministers have acted unlawfully \u2013 under judicial review, it happens all the time \u2013 but it is rare to read a court judgment as damning as today\u2019s. You are right to say that some ministers have resigned over matters that are far more trivial. But ministers go when they have lost the confidence of the prime minister. The PM only goes if he or she loses the confidence of the electorate (in a general election), their party or the House of Commons. Tory MPs still support Johnson (and, even if they didn\u2019t, the 1922 Committee quietly agreed a new rule recently ruling out a leadership challenge until Johnson has been in post for a year). And, as for losing the confidence of the Commons, see the answer above. Who would be Tory leader if Johnson resigned? MPs cannot get rid of Johnson using a humble address. If they wanted to remove him, a no-confidence vote is the mechanism available. But your question does raise the question of who might take over if Johnson were to resign (which he says he won\u2019t). There is no deputy Tory leader, or deputy prime minister. Dominic Raab is first secretary of state as well as foreign secretary, which makes him Johnson\u2019s de facto deputy. But, unlike other first secretaries of state, he is outranked by the chancellor, Sajid Javid, in the cabinet\u2019s pecking order. (Ministers are ranked in the official list in order of seniority.) In practice, if Johnson were to go, he and colleagues would have to agree who to recommend go the Queen as interim PM, pending a Conservative leadership election. Given that the Conservative party is now a firmly pro-Brexit party, and Javid voted remain, it probably would be Raab. UPDATE: See 4.32pm for an alternative view. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s speech is now scheduled to start at 4.30pm. From Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby Gina Miller, who launched the legal challenge against prorogation in England, has said Boris Johnson should apologise to the Queen for asking her to agree to an unlawful prorogation of parliament. From Sky\u2019s Rob Powell These are from Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby. These are from my colleague Jennifer Rankin in Brussels, who is sceptical of Boris Johnson\u2019s claim that the supreme court ruling will make it harder for him to get a Brexit deal. (See 1.41pm.) Johnson thinks that if the EU believes there is any chance of parliament delaying Brexit, they will not offer the compromises needed for a Brexit deal to happen. These are from the Mirror\u2019s Dan Bloom. Plaid Cymru\u2019s Westminster Leader, Liz Saville Roberts, said opposition party leaders should be ready to impeach Boris Johnson if he failed to request an extension to article 50 to avoid a no-deal Brexit. She said: Boris Johnson has already driven a bulldozer through the constitution, so no longer are ideas like impeachment far-fetched. I will tell other opposition party leaders, we need to be ready to impeach Boris Johnson if he breaks the law. In 2004, Boris Johnson supported an attempt to impeach Tony Blair over the Iraq war, co-signing a motion tabled by current Plaid Cymru leader, Adam Price. Writing in a column for The Telegraph at the time, Johnson said that Blair deserved to be impeached because he had \u201ctreated parliament and the public with contempt\u201d. Saville Roberts said: Impeachment was a process backed by Boris Johnson not so long ago. A man sacked for serially lying backed the impeachment of Blair for the same reason \u2013 lying. If the prime minister becomes a law-breaker, we have an even stronger case for impeachment than the very cause he advocated back in 2004. A spokesman for Plaid Cymru said the party\u2019s priority was to deliver a people\u2019s vote, not a general election, and that they would vote against any motion of no confidence. \u201cParliament must be sitting whilst the extension [to article 50] is secured, which means beyond the European council meeting scheduled between the 14th to the 19th October,\u201d he said. Mark Drakeford, the Welsh first minister, has joined those saying Boris Johnson should resign. He said: When a prime minister is found to have acted unlawfully and undemocratically, I don\u2019t see how that person thinks that he can legitimately continue in office. And he tweeted this earlier. These are from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg. I\u2019ve taken down an earlier post about a tweet from @OdysseanProject, which used to be Dominic Cummings\u2019 Twitter feed, because I\u2019ve been told that account is now run by someone else. From the Telegraph\u2019s Steven Swinford It does not seem obvious to me that such a motion would pass. Boris Johnson no longer has a majority and, if opposition MPs have spent the last three weeks complaining about prorogation, it is hard to see why, as soon as they got back, the first thing they would do would be vote for another recess for the benefit of the Conservative party. It would be inconvenient, but not impossible, for the Conservative conference (which starts on Sunday, and is due to run until the following Wednesday) to go ahead with the Commons actually sitting. The Commons does not schedule recesses while the SNP are holding their conference. Boris Johnson could deliver his leader\u2019s speech on the Sunday, instead of on the Wednesday morning as planned. And Commons business could be scheduled to minimise the chances of key votes on the Monday or Tuesday. Boris Johnson has just delivered a speech at a business event in New York. He started with some comments on the supreme court ruling that echoed what he said in his TV interviews. (See 1.41pm). These are from my colleague Peter Walker who was there. Here are the main points from the interviews that Boris Johnson has been giving in New York. Johnson said the supreme court ruling would make getting a Brexit deal harder. Asked if he was running out of options, he said \u201con the contrary\u201d. He went on: As the law currently stands the UK leaves the EU on 31 October, come what may. But the interesting thing, the exciting thing for us now, is to get a good deal. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re working on. I\u2019ll be honest with you, it\u2019s not made much easier by this kind of stuff in parliament, or in the courts. Obviously getting a deal is not made much easier against this background. But we\u2019re going to get on and do it. He said he would respect the supreme court ruling - even though he strongly disagreed with it. He said: Obviously this is a verdict that we will respect and we respect the judicial process. I have to say that I strongly disagree with what the justices have found. I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s right but we will go ahead and of course parliament will come back ... I don\u2019t think this was the right decision, I think that the prorogation has been used for centuries without this kind of challenge. He said he still wanted to go ahead with a Queen\u2019s speech \u2013 which would require a fresh prorogation. He said: I do think there\u2019s a good case for getting on with a Queen\u2019s speech anyway and we will do that ... I don\u2019t think the justices remotely excluded the possibility of having a Queen\u2019s speech but what we will certainly do is ensure parliament has plenty of time to debate Brexit. The supreme court ruling does not stop Johnson having a second prorogation, ahead of a Queen\u2019s speech. But it would have to be a normal length one to be lawful \u2013 ie, lasting a few days, not weeks. He claimed some MPs were trying to frustrate Brexit. He said: More importantly, let\u2019s be in no doubt that there are a lot of people who want to frustrate Brexit. There are a lot of people who basically want to stop this country from coming out of the EU. And we have a parliament that is unable to be prorogued, it doesn\u2019t want to have an election, and I think it\u2019s time we took this forward. He refused to accept that the Benn Act made a no-deal Brexit on 31 October impossible. When it was put to him that the law would not allow a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, he replied: As the law stands, we leave on October 31. And I\u2019m very hopeful that we will get a deal. I think what the people of the country want is to see parliamentarians coming together in the national interest to get this thing done. From ITV\u2019s Robert Peston Boris Johnson is speaking on Sky News now. He says he disagrees with the court\u2019s decision. He says it is usual to have a Queen\u2019s speech now. Parliament won\u2019t allow an election, but it does not want prorogation either, he says. Q: Have you run out of options? On the contrary, Johnson says. He says he is trying to get a deal. He says this case has not made his task any easier. UPDATE: See 1.41pm for the full quotes. Tom Watson, the deputy Labour leader, was due to address the conference this afternoon. Having to decide to give this slot to Jeremy Corbyn instead, the party offered Watson the chance to address conference tomorrow. But he has turned it down. Watson\u2019s reference to saving the speech for the next conference is a bit particular. Is that a hint that he still expects to be in post this time next year, unlike perhaps his leader? Watson does not have much luck with his conference speeches. In 2017 he was given a speaking slot so late that by the time he started many delegates had left. Last year he was not invited to address the main conference at all. Jeremy Corbyn is going to give his Labour party conference speech at 4pm, we\u2019ve been told. A lot of you are asking questions below the line about what happens next. At this point it is hard to know, but here is my attempt to answer some of your questions. Can Boris Johnson prorogue again? The court judgment has not taken away the PM\u2019s power to prorogue parliament, but it has curtailed it. Boris Johnson could not try to prorogue parliament again for a lengthy period without effectively being in contempt of court. It is also possible that, faced with such a transparently illegal request, the Queen could say no \u2013 or at least threaten to (although this would involve the crown getting involved in politics in a way that has not happened for a century or more). But the judgment does allow a normal prorogation \u2013 one, at this time of year, that would last a few days ahead of a Queen\u2019s speech. Dominic Grieve has explained this well - see 11.50am. Did Boris Johnson lie to the Queen? The supreme court did not accept the government\u2019s claim that prorogation had nothing to do with limiting the ability of MPs to scrutinise Brexit. But it did not accuse him of lying to the Queen. Johnson himself has denied lying to the Queen about prorogation. But we don\u2019t know what he said to her in private about his plans \u2013 and of course she won\u2019t say anything about that either. The Queen has got more inside knowledge of British politics than anyone alive, and it is safe to assume that she knew exactly what he was up to when he was requesting this prorogation. She may feel that the royal prerogative has been abused (it has). But that does not necessarily mean that she feels personally misled. Could Boris Johnson be impeached? Almost certainly not. As a process impeachment is now considered obsolete. What is less clear, however, is what will happen if Boris Johnson does try to defy the spirit or the letter of the law. Some of the briefing from Number 10 suggests he already wants to bypass the Benn Act intended to force him to request a Brexit delay if no deal has been passed by 19 October, and now there may be some in Downing Street considering how he can sidestep this judgment. We don\u2019t know what would happen if he did, although a former DPP has said Johnson could ultimately be jailed for contempt of court. What is more likely is that, if Johnson were to try to defy the law, parts of government and the civil service would go on strike. Some ministers, particularly the law officers, might resign, and Johnson has been told civil servants would not work for a minister acting illegally. Some Tory MPs feel much the same way about Dominic Cummings as Nigel Farage (see 11.17am), according to the Telegraph\u2019s Steven Swinford. Perhaps the most significant part of John Bercow\u2019s statement (see 12.14pm) was his comment about being open to SO24 applications for emergency debates. He seemed to be encouraging MPs to start tabling them now. In the past SO24 motions were just used to hold three-hour debates of no consequence. But earlier this month Bercow allowed Sir Oliver Letwin to use an SO24 motion to take control of the Commons order paper for a day or more, allowing MPs to pass the Benn bill designed to rule out a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. Opposition MPs are likely to try the same trick again, to pass motions or laws preventing Boris Johnson from trying to prorogue parliament again. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s speech to Labour conference will take place this afternoon, Labour officials have announced. It was due to take place tomorrow. We don\u2019t have the time yet. Bercow says the citizens of the UK are entitled to expect that parliament performs its function. He says he has instructed his officials to prepare for the resumption of the work of the Commons. It is not a recall of parliament, he says, because parliament was not properly prorogued. He says he wants it to sit tomorrow at 11.30am. He has contacted party leaders, or senior representatives of parties where that is not possible, he says. He says it will not be possible for there to be PMQs tomorrow because of notification requirements. But he says it will be possible for MPs to table urgent questions, for ministers to make statements and for MPs to table SO24 (standing order 24) motions calling for emergency debates. UPDATE: Here is the full text of what Bercow said: I welcome the judgement this morning of the supreme court. That judgment is unanimous, that judgment is unambiguous and that judgment is unqualified. As you all now know that judgment is that the prorogation of parliament was unlawful, unlawful because it prevented or frustrated parliament in the discharge in its core duties and it did so at a crucial time for our country. The citizens of the UK are entitled to expect that parliament does discharge its core functions, that it is in a position to scrutinise the executive, to hold ministers to account and to legislate if it chooses. In the light of that explicit judgement I have instructed the house authorities to prepare, not for the recall \u2013 the prorogation was unlawful and is void \u2013 to prepare for the resumption of the business of the House of Commons. Specifically I\u2019ve instructed the house authorities to undertake such lengths as are necessary to ensure that the House of Commons sits tomorrow and that it does so at 11.30am. I have contacted party leaders and where that has not been possible senior representatives of political parties in order to inform them of my thinking and prepare a way for the House of Commons to do its work. Owning to notification requirements, with which I am sure you are all closely familiar, it will not be possible for there to be a Prime Minister\u2019s Questions tomorrow. However, for the avoidance of doubt, there will be full scope for urgent questions, for ministerial statements and for applications for emergency debates under standing order number 24. Colleagues I thank you for your interest and I hope you will agree that the position is clear and unmistakable. John Bercow, the Speaker, is making a statement outside the Houses of Parliament now. He says he welcomes the judgment from the supreme court. It is unanimous and unambiguous and unqualified, he says. He says the judgment is that the prorogation of parliament was unlawful. In New York City, where Boris Johnson is attending the UN general assembly (UNGA) \u2013 and where the verdict was delivered at 5.30am \u2013 the PM and his aides had a series of instant and tricky decisions to make. Officials with Johnson had said that it would take time to digest what they called an \u201cextraordinary\u201d ruling and provide a response, and there was no indication when or how this would come. The PM was scheduled to make what had been billed as the major Brexit-related speech of the two-day trip at about 8am (1pm BST), telling US business leader and investors about how the country would change after departure. Johnson was also set to have a series of bilateral talks, including with President Trump and Ireland\u2019s Leo Varadkar, and to make his speech to the general assembly. Johnson and his team face a difficult decision on whether to keep to this, or to head to London. One option could be to take the prime ministerial plane back to London late on Tuesday rather than, as currently expected, first thing Wednesday. If the current schedule is maintained he would not be back in No 10 until late on Wednesday night \u2013 a long delay amid calls for his resignation. Speaking to reporters on the flight over, Johnson had said he would not resign if the case went against him. From Sky\u2019s Sam Coates Elaine Motion, the senior solicitor with the Edinburgh law firm Balfour+Manson who represented Joanna Cherry MP and the 75 other petitioners in the Scottish case, said the supreme court\u2019s ruling upheld the \u201ccritical importance\u201d of the sovereignty of parliament. In a statement, Motion said: The unanimous decision of the UK supreme court today, to cut down the prorogation, essentially reconfirms the position taken by the court of session inner house. That means that the clock is rewound to 27 August and parliament is not suspended. It is as if the suspension never occurred. It is a huge vindication for the parliamentarians who led the way with the challenge in Scotland and an even more significant reinforcement of the critical importance of the rule of law and the sovereignty of parliament. Hopefully parliament can now get back to its essential work. Labour whips are telling MPs to prepare for a return to parliament on Wednesday. At the parliamentary Labour party office at Labour\u2019s annual conference whips, including Thangam Debbonaire, are telling MPs that they may be back in the house within hours. Liz McInnes, the shadow Foreign Office minister, said: \u201cThe present mood is that we will try and rearrange something for tomorrow.\u201d Dominic Grieve, the former Conservative attorney general who now sits as an independent, having had the whip withdrawn over Brexit, has said that this judgment should make it impossible for Boris Johnson to respond with a second prorogation \u2013 other than a short one before a Queen\u2019s speech. Grieve explained: I would have thought that any attempt in proroguing parliament following this judgment for anything other than the four or five days to go between one session and another will immediately attract another court application, and this time in view of the supreme court judgment, there will be an immediate order that it is unlawful. It is a constitutional change, but it\u2019s one, it seems to me, that came logically from the role parliament plays in a parliamentary free democracy. The idea that you can play fast and loose with parliament, just to nudge it to one side when it\u2019s convenient for the executive to do so, is dead and buried for good. Here is the Evening Standard splash. George Osborne, the former Tory chancellor who edits the paper, backed Boris Johnson for party leader. Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament\u2019s lead spokesman on Brexit, has welcomed the result. This is what Shami Chakrabarti, the shadow attorney general, told BBC News about the ruling. [Boris Johnson] has behaved like a tin-pot dictator and he\u2019s been called out today by the supreme court, the highest court in these islands. He should be ashamed of himself, thoroughly ashamed of himself, he knows better, he knows better. He had an elite education, every opportunity in life and he has behaved in the most appalling way and he has been called out. How will we set an example to our country if the prime minister does not now reflect on being called out by the highest court in the land? This is from Amber Rudd, who resigned as work and pensions secretary after concluding that Boris Johnson was not serious about avoiding a no-deal Brexit. Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, says the judgment shows that Boris Johnson is \u201cnot fit to be prime minister\u201d. In a statement she said: The court have found what we all knew all along, Boris Johnson has again proven he is not fit to be prime minister. This shutdown was an unlawful act designed to stop parliament doing its job and holding the government to account. Given this verdict, parliament should be sitting so that we can continue to question the Conservative government on their disastrous Brexit plans. This verdict has been unanimously agreed by experienced judges who have considered the case on its merits, acting as impartial guardians of our democratic system. The rule of law is an important pillar of our democracy, and those looking to use this opportunity as an excuse to attack these judges would be not only attacking them, but also the entire principle of our legal system. It remains the Liberal Democrats\u2019 priority to stop no-deal Brexit and to stop Brexit altogether. The fact that all the main opposition parties are now either directly calling for Boris Johnson\u2019s resignation (Labour, the SNP and Plaid Cymru) or saying he is not fit to be PM (the Lib Dems - but effectively it means the same thing) will make it harder for them to explain why they are not tabling a motion of no confidence. But Jeremy Corbyn would not want to hold a vote without being sure that it would lead to MPs voting for an alternative government (preferably one led by him), and there is no guarantee of that at the moment. And without a viable alternative government, a successful vote of no confidence would lead to an election \u2013 and possibly a no-deal Brexit on 31 October in the meantime. We have not had an official response from Number 10 yet - Boris Johnson is in New York, where people are just getting up - but Sky\u2019s Sam Coates, who is there, says Downing Street sources are describing this as an \u201cextraordinary\u201d judgment. They will say more later. And here is the full text of what Jeremy Corbyn told the Labour conference in Brighton after the supreme court decision was announced. He said: The supreme court has just announced its decision. And it shows that the prime minister has acted wrongly in shutting down parliament. It demonstrates, it demonstrates a contempt for democracy and an abuse of power by him. And the supreme court therefore passes the baton to the Speaker to recall parliament. I will be in touch immediately to demand that parliament is recalled so that we can question the prime minister, demand that he obeys the law that\u2019s been passed by parliament, and recognise that our parliament is elected by our people to hold our government to account. A Labour government would want to be held to account. We wouldn\u2019t bypass democracy. And I invite Boris Johnson, in the historic words, to consider his position. And become the shortest-serving prime minister there\u2019s ever been. So, obey the law, take no deal off the table, and have an election to elect a government that respects democracy, that respects the rule of law and brings power back to the people, not usurps it in the way Boris Johnson has done. Here is the full text of John Bercow\u2019s statement quoted earlier. (See 10.54am.) I welcome the supreme court\u2019s judgment that the prorogation of parliament was unlawful. The judges have rejected the government\u2019s claim that closing down parliament for five weeks was merely standard practice to allow for a new Queen\u2019s speech. In reaching their conclusion, they have vindicated the right and duty of parliament to meet at this crucial time to scrutinise the executive and hold ministers to account. As the embodiment of our parliamentary democracy, the House of Commons must convene without delay. To this end, I will now consult the party leaders as a matter of urgency. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, is also calling for someone to resign. But he wants Dominic Cummings, the PM\u2019s chief of staff, to quit. Cummings is widely seen as the person encouraging Boris Johnson to adopt an ultra-confrontational approach with parliament. Farage\u2019s comment suggests he is worried Johnson\u2019s tactics could be jeopardising the whole Brexit project. Here\u2019s another call for Boris Johnson\u2019s resignation, from Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party. This is from its leader at Westminster, Liz Saville Roberts. The supreme court has delivered a damning and unanimous verdict. Boris Johnson has broken the law for undermining the basic principles of democracy. The prime minister has shown himself to be no better than a tin-pot dictator, shutting down democracy to avoid scrutiny. There is no question, the prime minister must resign immediately and a crash-out Brexit stopped once and for all. In his short time in office Boris Johnson has proven himself to be a deeply dangerous and anti-democratic leader, with no respect for the rule of law. It would be a complete affront to civilised society if the prime minister did not resign after this historic ruling. The SNP\u2019s Joanna Cherry has also called for Boris Johnson to resign. At the Labour conference Jeremy Corbyn has taken to the stage. He says the supreme court judgment demonstrates Boris Johnson\u2019s contempt for parliament. He says he will write to the Speaker demanding an urgent recall of parliament. He says a Labour government would want to be held to account. It would not bypass democracy. And he says Boris Johnson should \u201cin the historic words, consider his position\u201d. That means he thinks Johnson should resign. And that would make him \u201cthe shortest serving prime minister there has ever been\u201d, he says. Here is the John Bercow statement in full. From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg Here is an extract from the summary of the judgment (pdf). This prolonged suspension of parliamentary democracy took place in quite exceptional circumstances: the fundamental change which was due to take place in the constitution of the United Kingdom on 31 October. Parliament, and in particular the House of Commons as the elected representatives of the people, has a right to a voice in how that change comes about. The effect upon the fundamentals of our democracy was extreme. No justification for taking action with such an extreme effect has been put before the court. The only evidence of why it was taken is the memorandum from Nikki da Costa of 15 August. This explains why holding the Queen\u2019s speech to open a new session of parliament on 14th October would be desirable. It does not explain why it was necessary to bring parliamentary business to a halt for five weeks before that, when the normal period necessary to prepare for the Queen\u2019s speech is four to six days. It does not discuss the difference between prorogation and recess. It does not discuss the impact of prorogation on the special procedures for scrutinising the delegated legislation necessary to achieve an orderly withdrawal from the European Union, with or without a withdrawal agreement, on 31 October. It does not discuss what parliamentary time would be needed to secure parliamentary approval for any new withdrawal agreement, as required by section 13 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018. The court is bound to conclude, therefore, that the decision to advise Her Majesty to prorogue parliament was unlawful because it had the effect of frustrating or preventing the ability of parliament to carry out its constitutional functions without reasonable justification. The next and final question, therefore, is what the legal effect of that finding is and therefore what remedies the court should grant. The court can certainly declare that the advice was unlawful. The Inner House went further and declared that any prorogation resulting from it was null and of no effect. The government argues that the Inner House could not do that because the prorogation was a \u201cproceeding in parliament\u201d which, under the Bill of Rights of 1688 cannot be impugned or questioned in any court. But it is quite clear that the prorogation is not a proceeding in parliament. It takes place in the House of Lords chamber in the presence of members of both houses, but it is not their decision. It is something which has been imposed upon them from outside. It is not something on which members can speak or vote. It is not the core or essential business of parliament which the Bill of Rights protects. Quite the reverse: it brings that core or essential business to an end. This court has already concluded that the prime minister\u2019s advice to Her Majesty was unlawful, void and of no effect. This means that the order in council to which it led was also unlawful, void and of no effect and should be quashed. This means that when the royal commissioners walked into the House of Lords it was as if they walked in with a blank sheet of paper. The prorogation was also void and of no effect. Parliament has not been prorogued. This is the unanimous judgment of all 11 justices. It is for parliament, and in particular the Speaker and the Lord Speaker to decide what to do next. Unless there is some parliamentary rule of which we are unaware, they can take immediate steps to enable each house to meet as soon as possible. It is not clear to us that any step is needed from the prime minister, but if it is, the court is pleased that his counsel have told the court that he will take all necessary steps to comply with the terms of any declaration made by this court. It follows that the advocate general\u2019s appeal in the case of Cherry is dismissed and Mrs Miller\u2019s appeal is allowed. The same declarations and orders should be made in each case. Here is a summary of the judgment (pdf). And here is the full text (pdf). Hale says prorogation is not a proceeding in parliament. Although it takes place in parliament, it is not their decision. It is something that has been imposed on them from outside. The PM\u2019s advice to Her Majesty was \u201cunlawful, void and of no effect\u201d. That means the order in council was also \u201cunlawful, void and of no effect\u201d. That means the prorogation had no effect. She says it is as if the royal commission had no effect. Parliament has not been prorogued, she says. She says it is for the Speaker to decide what happens next. Hale says the court is \u201cbound to conclude that the decision to advise Her Majesty to prorogue parliament was unlawful\u201d. Hale says the prorogation did impede parliament. The effect on the fundamentals of democracy was extreme. She says the government has not justified such a long prorogation. Hale says, once that principle is established, the next question is whether this prorogation stopped parliament carrying out its usual functions. This \u201cprolonged\u201d prorogation was unusual, she says. Hale says there are two issues with a prerogative power. First, does the power exist? Second, is it subject to judicial review? Hale says there is no doubt that the courts can review a prerogative power. All the parties accept that. What is at issue is what are the limits of this power. Hale says parliament must be able to make laws everyone can obey. This principle would be undermined if the government could close parliament, she says. She says parliament must also be able to hold the executive to account. She says at the moment prorogation will be unlawful if it has the effect of preventing parliament form being able to carry out its constitutional functions. Hale says 11 justices heard the appeal. The judgment is unanimous, she says. She says the matter is justiciable. Hale says, after prorogation was announced, when parliament returned, MPs passed an act designed to stop a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. She says the high court in England threw out the legal challenge, saying this matter was not justiciable. But the Scottish court of session said this was justiciable. Hale says a cabinet meeting was held by conference call soon afterwards to bring the cabinet up to speed. Soon after that the decision was announced, and Boris Johnson wrote to MPs about it. Hale says Gina Miller then launched a legal challenge. Hale is explaining the facts of the case. She describes the visit of three privy counsellors to the Queen at Balmoral. An order in council was made for parliament to be prorogued. Lady Hale is giving her judgment now. (But the sound quality from the feed we are watching is very poor.) From the SNP MP Joanna Cherry, who brought the legal challenge against prorogation in Scotland. From my colleague Ben Quinn And this is from the FT\u2019s David Allen Green on what might happen. And the legal commentator Joshua Rozenberg has a good guide as to what to expect. Catherine Haddon from the Institute for Government has quite a useful Twitter thread on what to look out for in the supreme court judgment starting here. Turning back to Labour and the climate change emergency, Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, told the Today programme this morning that she was \u201chappy\u201d with both the motions being debated by conference \u2013 including the one setting 2030 as a target for achieving net zero carbon emissions. (See 10.01am.) But she said her support for the target was conditional on it being accompanied by a \u201ccredible plan\u201d to achieve it, put together with trade unions and industry. From my colleague Ben Quinn, who is at the supreme court When Jeremy Corbyn was elected Labour leader he said he wanted to give party members more say over policy. Obviously he does not quite see eye to eye with many members on Brexit, but at this conference delegates have been given more say to debate policy than in the past and, just as yesterday they debated two rival motions on Brexit, today they will debate two rival ones on climate change. Composite 16 (green new deal) says a Labour government should work towards net zero carbon emissions, but it does not set a deadline. Composite 17 (Labour\u2019s socialist green new deal) says Labour should \u201cwork towards a path to net zero carbon emissions by 2030\u201d and make this a legal target if it can be achieved alongside a \u201cjust transition for workers\u201d. On the Today programme this morning Tim Roache, general secretary of the GMB union, said this proposals would be impossible to achieve. He said: The proposal to do it by 2030 threatens whole communities, threatens jobs, and frankly GMB members in communities right up and down the UK have heard it all before. We heard it before about a just transition. What does a just transition mean? Roache said the plan would have a drastic impact on families. This will mean that within a decade people\u2019s petrol cars being confiscated. This will mean families can only take one flight every five years ... Net zero carbon emissions by 2030 is utterly unachievable. We can\u2019t go to the country with a plan that is, frankly, not credible, is not deliverable. The National Crime Agency said it has found no evidence of criminality after investigating a series of claims against Brexit campaign group Leave.EU and the businessman Arron Banks. As the Press Association reports, investigators interviewed Banks and the Leave.EU campaign\u2019s chief executive, Liz Bilney, as they looked at potential offences concerning 8 million of EU referendum campaign funding. This morning the NCA said that no evidence of crime had been found and that no further action would be taken against the pair, or campaign groups Better for the Country Ltd or Leave.EU. The NCA said: In carrying out its complex investigation the NCA analysed information, including banking information, which had not formed part of the Electoral Commission\u2019s investigation. It also interviewed Mr Banks and Ms Bilney. In reaching its decision, the NCA obtained advice from the Crown Prosecution Service and expert independent counsel due to the technical nature of Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act (PPERA) offences and the company structures involved. The NCA has found no evidence that any criminal offences have been committed under PPERA or company law by any of the individuals or organisations referred to it by the Electoral Commission. It will therefore take no further action against Mr Banks, Ms Bilney, Better for the Country Ltd or Leave.EU in respect of this specific matter. Supporters of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Brexit stance argue for it partly on the grounds that the party has to be ambivalent because otherwise it might lose support from leave voters at the general election. But on the Today programme this morning the leading elections expert Prof Sir John Curtice said it was hard to see how a compromise strategy would succeed. He said: There is no doubt that the Labour party faces the challenge: how does it keep the coalition [of remain voters and leave voters] it has together. But at the end of the day the arithmetic doesn\u2019t lie. For every one voter who voted Labour and leave, there were two in 2017 who voted remain. And the difficulty about believing that Labour\u2019s latest variation of its compromise designed to appeal to both groups is going to work is that the party has lost ground heavily among remainers and among leavers. It lost that ground such that by the end of May it was only running at about 25% in the polls across the electorate as a whole. There is no evidence at all of any recovery in that figure. And so therefore it is not clear why yet another compromise \u2013 a compromise that looks unlikely to appeal to either Labour remainers or Labour leavers - is actually going to succeed in repairing the damage. Remember, around two-thirds of those people who are Labour leavers say that actually their preferred policy is Boris Johnson\u2019s policy of just: let\u2019s get out by 31 October. Meanwhile Labour remain voters are, if anything, closer to Jo Swinson\u2019s view, let\u2019s just revoke article 50 and wanting another referendum. So how either of these groups is going to get attracted back by the policy is not immediately obvious. Curtice said that it was generally assumed that politicians need to be in the centre ground to win, and that Corbyn is often seen as extreme. But on Brexit, Curtice said, Corbyn was in the centre \u2013 when, on this issue, the extreme views were more popular. On a subject where the centre ground is very thinly populated - the two most popular options are either leaving without a deal or let\u2019s just revoke article 50 - on this issue where actually being one of the extreme positions seems to be more electorally popular, Jeremy Corbyn, the supposed radical of British politics, has chosen to be the last compromiser. Curtice said that support for Labour fell heavily in the spring, when its compromise Brexit position was facing strong criticism. He admitted that it was possible for the party to win back the support it had lost. But he said that it was not easy to see how it would win back support from the Lib Dems and the Greens given its Brexit policy. And he said that Corbyn\u2019s general approval ratings were a problem too. The risk with [Corbyn\u2019s Brexit policy] is that, as a result, he gives the impression of being a ditherer and lacking leadership. Whether it\u2019s what people think about Jeremy Corbyn in general, or about how he\u2019s been handling Brexit in particular, the numbers are very poor indeed. In fact Ipsos Mori, in their most recent poll, actually recorded last week, in terms of the level of satisfaction with Jeremy Corbyn in general, the worst figure for any opposition leader since Ipsos Mori started polling in 1977. The days when Jeremy Corbyn was popular ... for the time being at least are very much behind us. Yesterday the Labour party voted to postpone any decision about how it might campaign in a second referendum on Brexit until after the general election, and after the renegotiation planned by Jeremy Corbyn if he wins. But if anyone thought that was the last word on the matter, they were mistaken. Shortly afterwards, speaking at a fringe event organised by Politico Europe, Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, implied that the vote did not matter much because it was \u201cobvious\u201d where Labour would end up. He said: I have got a pretty clear idea of where the members are on this and therefore I think it is very likely that the members will want us to campaign for remain. We campaigned for remain in 2016, we are currently campaigning for remain against any Tory outcome, and it seems to me obvious where the membership is on this. Starmer also said he had \u201cmixed feelings\u201d about the hints from Jeremy Corbyn that he might remain neutral in a second referendum. Today the Labour conference is focusing on the climate emergency. As my colleague Fiona Harvey reports, the party has announced plans to build dozens of new state-owned offshore windfarms ahead of a debate on a proposal for the UK to have a target of cutting net carbon emissions to zero by 2030 - an idea dismissed as impossible by trade unions. Here is Fiona\u2019s story. But events at the Labour conference will probably be overshadowed by an announcement from the supreme court in London, which will declare whether or not Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend (prorogue) parliament for five weeks was lawful. The government effectively argued that this was a political decision and that it none of the court\u2019s business. Perhaps the court will accept this argument, but many legal observers think it won\u2019t, and so the judgment could have a lasting effect on the constitution, constraining an important power currently available to the PM. (Johnson was able to prorogue using the royal prerogative - a process that allows the PM to take decisions alone, without consulting parliament.) More immediately, the judgment could lead to parliament being reconvened this week (although lawyers are divided on how this would or could happen). Jeremy Corbyn has already said that, if MPs go back early, the first thing the opposition parties will do will be try to pass a move to stop Johnson proroguing again. Here is the agenda for the day. 10.10am: Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, speaks at the Labour conference at the start of a debate covering the green new deal and corporate governance. 10.30am: The supreme court delivers its judgment on whether Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue (suspend) parliament for five weeks was lawful. 12.25pm: Sue Hayman, the shadow environment secretary, speaks at the Labour conference. 2.15pm: Tom Watson, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, speaks at the conference. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I will be covering the supreme court judgment in detail, but also covering events at the Labour conference. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up.

Nick Ames was at the Emirates to see Gabriel Martinelli introduce himself in style. Everton eased past Sheffield Wednesday, to keep their dream of a first trophy since 1995 alive. Liz Byrnes was on hand to witness a good evening for Dominic Calvert-Lewin. More on that south-coast derby, courtesy of Ben Fisher at Fratton Park. Paul Wilson was at Deepdale to see Raheem Sterling run riot. A word on the south-coast derby from Danny Ings (who supported Southampton as a kid) and James Ward-Prowse (a Portsmouth fan as a lad). \u201cIt\u2019s a derby that I have always wanted to play in,\u201d says Ings. \u201cI\u2019ve been very fortunate to play in other derbies but this one tops it off for me. Obviously a great night, great for the fans and a fantastic win.\u201d Ward-Prowse adds: \u201cIt was a special occasion, great for the area. I think both sets of fans have been looking forward to this. These are the games as players you want to play in. We knew what we had to do and we did a fantastic job. We came here to do a job and we are in the hat for the next round, that\u2019s what we will be celebrating on the way home.\u201d All the full-time scores. Arsenal 5-0 Nottingham Forest Colchester United 0-0 Tottenham Hotspur (Colchester win 4-3 on pens) Crawley Town 1-1 Stoke City (Crawley win 5-3 on pens) Luton Town 0-4 Leicester City Portsmouth 0-4 Southampton Preston North End 0-3 Manchester City Sheffield Wednesday 0-2 Everton Watford 2-1 Swansea City Quite a contrast in emotions in north London tonight. For the second successive round, Crawley have seen off a Championship side! Stoke follow Leeds, and it\u2019s officially crisis time in the Potteries. Martinelli has announced himself tonight. He\u2019s already got one. Now he\u2019s curled a vicious shot into the top right from 25 yards. This is now a rout. We could have another shock on our hands! Sam Vokes has missed Stoke\u2019s first penalty in the shootout with Crawley. After a couple of spot-kicks each, it\u2019s 2-1 to the League Two club ... and the pressure is on struggling Stoke City! As if Tottenham\u2019s night wasn\u2019t bad enough. Lapslie slams home ... and the 2008 winners are out! The Champions League finalists have been knocked out by a side from League Two! Fans flood onto the pitch in celebration! Spurs have gone the same way as Crystal Palace, who were defeated on penalties in the second round. It\u2019s Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s first defeat as Spurs boss to a club from the lower leagues! And now it\u2019s 3-3 after four spot kicks each. Lucas Moura, the hero of the Champions League semi final against Ajax, stutters his run-up and clips Tottenham\u2019s fifth penalty off the top of the crossbar. Tom Lapslie will have a penalty to win it for Colchester! ... it\u2019s level between Spurs and Colchester after three penalties each. It\u2019s 2-2. Christian Eriksen missed the first one for Spurs. Then Jevani Brown tried a Panenka. It was such a weak effort, Paulo Gazzaniga, having dived, was able to spring back up and punch the ball away, livid at his opponent\u2019s cheek! What drama! A second match is going to penalties. Speaking of which ... Southampton\u2019s first win in a south-coast derby since 2005. And it\u2019s a big one. The perfect way to bounce back from an eight-goal defeat. Much relief for Marco Silva. Wednesday can\u2019t avenge defeat in the 1966 FA Cup final. The three-time winners breeze through, and Leicester\u2019s fine start to the season continues apace. Joe Willock makes it certain for the Gunners. Another corner, a bit of pinball, and Willock slots it home from eight yards. Another memorable performance from Raheem Sterling, and the holders are into the fourth round. The League Two side have taken last year\u2019s Champions League finalists to penalties! Kelechi Iheanacho is sent clear down the left and chips the keeper. A delightful - and rare - goal for the Foxes striker. Corner. A simple header from close range for Rob Holding. The four-time winners Forest are heading out. Pompey gave as good as they got in the first half, but they\u2019ve eventually been outclassed. And Nathan Redmond has scored the goal of the game, whizzing down the left, drifting inside, and launching a sweet shot into the bottom left. A night to forget for Pompey ... though of course Saints fans will remind them of this scoreline at every possible opportunity. Gerard Deulofeu scampers down the left, draws a few Swansea defenders, then slips a ball across the face of goal, allowing Roberto Pereyra to clip home from close range. It\u2019s all over at Kenilworth Road as well. Kelechi Iheanacho should score upon barging clear, but stumbles as he tries to round the keeper. No matter! He at least keeps the move going, and the ball\u2019s looped to the left for Youri Tielemans, who races into the box and whistles a volley home. Cedric has won the derby for Saints. Well, he\u2019s the scorer, though it\u2019s Danny Ings who has really done the business. Ings has already scored two; now he\u2019s scampered down the left and reached the byline, the ball breaking back for Cedric, who slams home. This will be Southampton\u2019s first win over the old enemy since 2005. Goals please. Please. Aw come on. A reminder that any games drawn after 90 minutes go straight to penalties. With this in mind, Spurs - no trophy since winning this competition in 2008, remember - throw on Erik Lamela as well. Not so long to grind out the win against League Two Colchester. The irrepressible Raheem Sterling nearly sets up another goal for Manchester City at Deepdale. He skates down the middle of the park and flicks the ball to Phil Foden on his right. Foden bashes a shot off the crossbar. But still no second-half goal in any of these third-round games. Sterling, though. What a star. Collins comes sliding straight through the back of AN Opponent at high speed. It\u2019s comically reckless, utterly needless, and struggling Stoke are up against it now. Dear me. What pointless hoodlummery. Tottenham are still looking to crack the Colchester code. Last season\u2019s Champions League runners-up are frustrated enough against the League Two side to have just brought on Christian Eriksen and Son Heung-min. Goals, please. Please. Preston hit the post against champions Manchester City! Josh Harrop sashays in from the right, leans back, and whips a low shot off the bottom of the right-hand post. On another night, the former Manchester United player could have had a couple of goals for the hosts. The slim margins between a thriller and a thrashing. Some more close misses. Sam Surridge fails to bundle a high ball across the line for Swansea at Watford; it\u2019s quite astonishing that he didn\u2019t connect. Meanwhile Kyle Walker-Peters nearly opens the scoring for Spurs at Colchester, lashing in a cross from the right that evades everyone and comes off the left-hand upright! But no second-half goals to report yet. It\u2019s end to end at Crawley. Ollie Palmer should have given the hosts the lead over Stoke, sent clear by a poor defensive backflick. But he didn\u2019t have the pace to reach the area, then went over too easily looking for a penalty. He didn\u2019t get it. Then Stoke went up the other end, Jordan Cousins slamming home from close range ... but from an offside position. We\u2019re into the second half in seven League Cup matches around the country. Meanwhile it\u2019s just gone half-time at the Emirates, where Arsenal go in 1-0 ahead of Forest. Half-time entertainment. Colchester 0-0 Tottenham Crawley 1-1 Stoke Luton 0-2 Leicester Portsmouth 0-2 Southampton Preston 0-3 Manchester City Sheffield Wednesday 0-2 Everton Watford 1-1 Swansea They\u2019re still playing at the Emirates, where the game kicked off at 8pm. It\u2019s currently 1-0 to the Gunners against Forest. This is a peach of a goal, a PlayStation special. Reiss Nelson sprays a pass wide right to Calum Chambers, who volleys a first-time cross towards Martinelli at the near post. Martinelli twists in mid air to slam home. Portsmouth were pressing again. And again they\u2019re caught on the break. Danny Ings is sent scampering clear down the middle and he dinks a gorgeous chip over the keeper and into the net. Saints in control at the break. James Justin scores against his old club, gliding in from the right to meet a dropping diagonal pass and slamming home elegantly. He doesn\u2019t celebrate, and his old fans sportingly applaud their former player. Sterling just can\u2019t stop it. Now he\u2019s barrelling down the left, slipping a perfectly weighted pass into the box for David Silva, whose shot from a tight angle on the left is deflected past the keeper by Ryan Ledson. \u201cThe Man City kit looks like a few Bar\u00e7a away kits have run together in the wash,\u201d opines Gerard Nugent. Pep\u2019s influence runs deep. Misery descends on Stoke again. Nathan Ferguson fails to connect with a cute backheel, a low ball flying into the Stoke box from the right. But no matter! The ball sits up for him anyway, and he\u2019s able to whip it home. This is hardly breaking news, but Raheem Sterling is such a fine player. Now he\u2019s setting them up, slipping in Gabriel Jesus after causing all manner of hassle down the inside-left channel. Sterling is simply unplayable in this mood. Watford\u2019s respite didn\u2019t last long. Sam Surridge, on loan from Bournemouth, levels it up at Vicarage Road, sliding in to meet Nathan Dyer\u2019s right-wing cross. It\u2019s his fourth goal of the season. A cute corner from Marc Albrighton, clipped to the near post and flicked back to Demarai Gray, who bundles a shot into the bottom left. Luton were caught snoozing. One straight out of Brendan Rodgers playbook. The manager will be well chuffed with that. On the subject of much needed respite, here\u2019s some for injury-plagued Danny Welbeck and recently-shellacked Watford. The striker plants a header home at a corner, and it\u2019s his first goal since last October. Bagatelle at a corner, and Sam Vokes slams home from close range. Some much needed respite for under-pressure Supremes earworm Nathan Jones. Against the run of play, Saints have taken the lead at Fratton. Danny Ings shoots from the edge of the box, and the Premier League club take the lead. He very nearly makes it 2-0 a few seconds after, but can\u2019t quite chip MacGillivray in the Pompey goal. Sweet baby Moses, have you seen what Manchester City are wearing this evening? They\u2019re decked out like a packet of sweets from the 1970s. Hey, does anybody remember sweets that wouldn\u2019t pass EU regulations these days, etc. A proper envelope-pushing comedian could get a whole bit out of that. Anyway, their psychedelic gear has got Preston spinning, because Raheem Sterling has just run at them with great pace and skill, swerving this way and that before banging a shot home from just inside the box. What a run that is! League One Portsmouth are giving a good account of themselves against Premier League Southampton. John Marquis has just barged his way down the right and thumped a long-range effort off the outside of the right-hand post. Not at all sure Alex McCarthy would have got to that, had it been on target. McCarthy does get his fingers to Brett Pittman\u2019s rising screamer a few minutes later, though. Great save. Pompey on top. What a start for under-fire Marco Silva ... and for Dominic Calvert-Lewin. He\u2019s just poked in Alex Iwobi\u2019s left-wing cross. Wednesday will take heart that they were 2-0 up in the 1966 FA Cup final against Everton, only to end up losing 3-2. Er, sort of. Spectacular cup turnarounds between these two sides have historical precedent, is all we\u2019re saying. This is a fine goal, and it\u2019s come against the early run of play. Wednesday had been on the front foot, but Dominic Calvert-Lewin was picked out down the inside-left channel, he romped into the area, and thumped an unstoppable shot into the roof of the net! No early goals. Though there was very nearly a shock start at Deepdale, where Josh Harrop - formerly of Manchester United - couldn\u2019t quite get a close-range header on target for Preston. Now that would have put the cat among the treble-winning pigeons. All the matches, save the one at the Emirates, have just kicked off. Here\u2019s the weather at Fratton Park, incidentally. Summer\u2019s gone. Autumn\u2019s here! Arsenal versus Nottingham Forest has been delayed by 15 minutes due to the entire country\u2019s transport infrastructure being totally jiggered. Re-nationalise the railways! Vote Labour! We paraphrase of course. The official club line is \u201ctravel issues for supporters\u201d. However you spin it, that match will now kick off at 8pm.

      "body": "<p>Eddie Jones bristled at the suggestion he is taking a risk by on Tuesday naming Billy Vunipola to start for the second time in five days against the USA, and issuing a stark warning to the 10 new faces in his England side. Vunipola is one of five players who will keep their place in the starting lineup for England\u2019s second World Cup match on Thursday but it is those incoming at the forefront of Jones\u2019s mind.</p> \n<p>This will be Vunipola\u2019s 11th successive appearance for England \u2013 he was the only player to start all four warm\u2011up matches \u2013 but, given his recent injury history, concerns would seem justified. Before the first of those 11 games he managed two Tests in two years and in the second of those he broke his arm for the second time. Jones, though, is adamant \u201cthe best way to keep him fit is to play him\u201d. Moreover Mark Wilson is not quite ready to start, so the head coach\u2019s options at No 8 are limited.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to pick 23 so by definition there has to be players backing up,\u201d said Jones. \u201cSo what do you want me to do, go in with less players?\u201d</p> \n<p>Vunipola is joined in backing up by George Ford, who captains the side, Tom Curry, who Jones says needs more experience at blindside flanker, Elliot Daly and Joe Marler. There is no Henry Slade because of his knee injury, though Jones claimed he could have played if needed, but Joe Cokanasiga and Ruaridh McConnochie come into the side on the wings and Dan Cole, who moves joint-third on the list of England\u2019s record appearance holders, will also start, as will Lewis Ludlam.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/23/world-cup-kicking-tactics\">The aerial battle will be the key to unlocking defences in World Cup | Nick Evans</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The day after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/22/rugby-world-cup-england-tonga-match-report\" title=\"\">England\u2019s scratchy victory over Tonga</a>, Ludlam explained how the players had barely turned their attentions to the USA and that it would be primarily done in Wednesday\u2019s training session.</p> \n<p>Jones, though, has been preparing for this match for some time. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/nov/17/england-japan-autumn-international-match-report\" title=\"\">Against Japan last November</a> he curtailed his side\u2019s preparation to replicate this four-day turnaround and made 11 changes to his starting XV. On Tuesday the players went out for lunch to sample Kobe\u2019s famous beef; in the week leading up to Japan, Jones arranged a sushi night at the team hotel.</p> \n<p>Against Japan, however, England were dreadful in the first half, run ragged by the fleet-footed Brave Blossoms with Owen Farrell having to come on at half-time to turn the tide. It is no surprise then that Farrell is again on the bench, just in case. Indeed, Jones was so displeased with that first half that it ended, or at least put on hold, a few international careers \u2013 none of Danny Care, Alex Lozowski or Zach Mercer has played for England since. \u201cWe could have the same problems,\u201d said the head coach. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult having a quick turnaround. There\u2019s no quick solution to it but we feel it\u2019s maybe more psychological than physical.\u201d</p> \n<p>Only three players who started against Japan are due to line up against the USA but, if that November afternoon made Jones rip up his plans in terms of personnel, it came together again last month. Just as the side who beat Tonga contained 13 of the team <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/24/england-ireland-rugby-world-cup-warm-up-match-report\" title=\"\">who thrashed Ireland</a> in the warm-up series, so the XV named on Tuesday has 12 survivors from the team <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/17/wales-england-rugby-world-cup-warm-up-match-report\" title=\"\">picked to face Wales</a> in Cardiff. Maybe that is why Jones was so happy after that match despite the defeat. They may have narrowly lost but there was no going off script.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6f1228e1-81b0-43d0-9d80-5cc9deb76e87\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>England team to face USA</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Elliot Daly; Ruaridh McConnochie, Jonathan Joseph, Piers Francis, Joe Cokanasiga; George Ford (capt), Willi Heinz, Joe Marler, Luke Cowan-Dickie,&nbsp;Dan Cole, Joe Launchbury,&nbsp;George Kruis, Tom Curry, Lewis Ludlam, Billy Vunipola&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Replacements&nbsp;</b>Jack Singleton, Ellis Genge, Kyle Sinckler, Courtney Lawes, Mark Wilson,&nbsp;Ben Youngs, Owen Farrell, Anthony Watson&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Jones recalled on Tuesday a pool match when working with South Africa in 2007 against Tonga. The Springboks squeezed to a 30-25 victory en route to lifting the trophy but Jones saw a number of fringe players putting personal gain before the collective. \u201cThat\u2019s the danger for us,\u201d the England head coach said. \u201cIt can happen in the second or the third game, where players who might think it\u2019s their only game of the World Cup go out there and they try to play for themselves rather than play for the team.\u201d</p> \n<p>That may go some way to explaining why Marler has retained his place in the side. It is not hard to imagine him and Cole as the enforcers within the squad. They sit at the back of the England team bus and no doubt keep the youngsters in line. \u201cThis squad is quite young, so having those older two props is quite important,\u201d Jones said.</p> \n<p>It also emphasises the importance of Ford on Thursday. He was captain against Japan \u2013 a tough afternoon for him, says Jones \u2013 but he has been a part of all but one of Jones\u2019s 46 matchday Test squads. \u201cIt could be easy to try and be impressive and try to stand out individually,\u201d Ford said.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think we\u2019ll be fine but it\u2019s something we\u2019ve got to keep our eye on in the next 24-48 hours. In a funny sort of way when you\u2019ve got only three or four days you get right down to the nitty gritty of the plan.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure>",

Indeed, Jones was so displeased with that first half that it ended, or at least put on hold, a few international careers \u2013 none of Danny Care, Alex Lozowski or Zach Mercer has played for England since. \u201cWe could have the same problems,\u201d said the head coach. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult having a quick turnaround. There\u2019s no quick solution to it but we feel it\u2019s maybe more psychological than physical.\u201d Only three players who started against Japan are due to line up against the USA but, if that November afternoon made Jones rip up his plans in terms of personnel, it came together again last month. Just as the side who beat Tonga contained 13 of the team who thrashed Ireland in the warm-up series, so the XV named on Tuesday has 12 survivors from the team picked to face Wales in Cardiff. Maybe that is why Jones was so happy after that match despite the defeat. They may have narrowly lost but there was no going off script. Jones recalled on Tuesday a pool match when working with South Africa in 2007 against Tonga. The Springboks squeezed to a 30-25 victory en route to lifting the trophy but Jones saw a number of fringe players putting personal gain before the collective. \u201cThat\u2019s the danger for us,\u201d the England head coach said. \u201cIt can happen in the second or the third game, where players who might think it\u2019s their only game of the World Cup go out there and they try to play for themselves rather than play for the team.\u201d That may go some way to explaining why Marler has retained his place in the side. It is not hard to imagine him and Cole as the enforcers within the squad. They sit at the back of the England team bus and no doubt keep the youngsters in line. \u201cThis squad is quite young, so having those older two props is quite important,\u201d Jones said. It also emphasises the importance of Ford on Thursday. He was captain against Japan \u2013 a tough afternoon for him, says Jones \u2013 but he has been a part of all but one of Jones\u2019s 46 matchday Test squads. \u201cIt could be easy to try and be impressive and try to stand out individually,\u201d Ford said. \u201cI think we\u2019ll be fine but it\u2019s something we\u2019ve got to keep our eye on in the next 24-48 hours. In a funny sort of way when you\u2019ve got only three or four days you get right down to the nitty gritty of the plan.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Labour has pledged to create a publicly-owned company to make cheap versions of medicines the NHS needs but cannot afford, such as Orkambi, which is denied to thousands of children and young people with life-shortening cystic fibrosis. Jeremy Corbyn told the Labour party conference that he had met nine-year-old Luis Walker, who suffers from the disease which clogs his lungs and makes breathing a struggle. \u201cEvery day he needs four hours of treatment and is often in hospital, which keeps him from school and his friends,\u201d said Corbyn. Corbyn said Orkambi could transform his life, \u201cbut Luis is denied the medicine he needs because its American manufacturer refuses to sell the drug to the NHS for an affordable price\u201d. People with hepatitis C and some forms of breast cancer were also \u201cbeing denied lifesaving medicines by a system that puts profits for shareholders before lives\u201d. In February, the Guardian revealed that campaigners were calling on the government to bypass the patent on Orkambi, submitting a dossier detailing how that could be done legally, under the World Trade Organization rules, through a device called crown use. Essentially, the UK would decree that the needs of the people outweighed the interests of the company. The company would get compensation, but nothing like the profits they want. Corbyn outlined a radical new medicines policy with the emphasis on public ownership. \u201cWe will redesign the system to serve public health, not private wealth,\u201d he told the conference. A publicly-owned company will make cheap generic versions of medicines deemed prohibitively expensive, which will necessitate setting a review of drug patents. The US drugs company Vertex priced Orkambi at over \u00a3100,000 per patient per year. In England about 5,000 young patients could benefit, but the NHS said it could not afford to pay the bill. Labour\u2019s new policy document, Medicines for the Many, recommends this option, which elsewhere is called compulsory licensing, for Orkambi. It says the UK should follow the examples of Argentina, Brazil and India, which already challenge patents and make affordable versions of some medicines in the public interest. Corbyn made it clear he would put pressure on the drugs companies to comply. \u201cWe will tell the drugs companies that if they want public research funding, then they will have to make their drugs affordable for all,\u201d he said. Orkambi campaigners welcomed Corbyn\u2019s speech. Christina Walker, Luis\u2019s mother, said: \u201cMy child\u2019s future is being put in jeopardy by the behaviour of one pharmaceutical company: Vertex. \u201cBut it\u2019s not the first or the last time that excessive profits have been put above patients\u2019 health, and with 7,000 rare diseases currently without an effective treatment or cure, our situation could be replicated many times over in the future if the government doesn\u2019t intervene now. \u201cAcross the NHS, the high price of new medicines is causing huge strain, affecting the lives of patients with conditions ranging from cancer to hepatitis.

      "body": "<p>Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Wednesday 25 September.</p> <h2>Top stories</h2> <p><strong>Nancy Pelosi is expected today to announce a formal impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump.</strong> House Democrats have gathered for a caucus meeting to discuss impeachment, after which the House speaker will deliver a statement <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2019/sep/24/trump-and-johnson-to-meet-amid-impeachment-and-brexit-woes-live\">in which she is expected to announce a formal impeachment inquiry</a>. Reporters are gathering outside Pelosi\u2019s office on Capitol Hill. Support for impeachment proceedings has increased this week after revelations that the president apparently sought to blackmail a foreign government by withholding military aid unless it helped investigate a political opponent. Earlier today, Pelosi and the majority leader, Steny Hoyer, confirmed that the House would vote on a resolution tomorrow condemning Trump\u2019s efforts to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/24/impeachment-calls-grow-amid-revelation-trump-ordered-block-on-ukraine-aid\">block the release of the whistleblower complaint about his call with the Ukrainian president</a>. </p> <p><strong>Barnaby Joyce spent less than three weeks on the ground while engaged as the government\u2019s special drought envoy</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/25/barnaby-joyce-spent-less-than-three-weeks-on-the-ground-while-drought-envoy\">according to MP travel records</a>. And while the government is refusing to release details of how much the position cost taxpayers, the former Nationals leader claimed $675,000 in expenses for the nine months in the role, and was allocated two staff members to conduct his work at a cost of an estimated $200,000. The $675,000 figure includes Joyce\u2019s normal work as a backbencher, but the government has declined to say how much was related to his work as special envoy. The analysis comes as the former deputy PM continues to defend his work in the position, which has come under scrutiny after it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/19/labor-lashes-drought-envoy-barnaby-joyce-for-failing-to-produce-report\">was revealed to parliament last week that he did not produce a final report</a>.</p> <p><strong>The Australian government is seen globally as climate \u201cdenialist\u201d</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/25/australian-government-seen-globally-as-climate-denialist-un-summit-observers-say\">UN summit observers say</a>. Scott Morrison is increasingly seen as running a government that is not serious about finding a global climate solution and uses \u201cgreenwash\u201d to meet its emissions commitments, according to analysts and former diplomats.

The $675,000 figure includes Joyce\u2019s normal work as a backbencher, but the government has declined to say how much was related to his work as special envoy. The analysis comes as the former deputy PM continues to defend his work in the position, which has come under scrutiny after it was revealed to parliament last week that he did not produce a final report. The Australian government is seen globally as climate \u201cdenialist\u201d, UN summit observers say. Scott Morrison is increasingly seen as running a government that is not serious about finding a global climate solution and uses \u201cgreenwash\u201d to meet its emissions commitments, according to analysts and former diplomats. Australian observers in New York said the PM\u2019s failure to attend a UN climate action summit on Monday despite being in the US, and his apparent rejection of the need for Australia to do more to address its rising greenhouse gas emissions, had eroded goodwill for the country on the issue. The Australian Taxation Office has accused Huang Xiangmo of intentionally structuring businesses to hinder creditors. In documents filed with the federal court, the ATO, which has hit Huang with a $140m tax bill, said it had concerns that he had \u201cintentionally structured his asset holdings in such a fashion so as to delay or hinder recovery by creditors\u201d. World Jeremy Corbyn has called for Boris Johnson to resign after the landmark ruling by Britain\u2019s highest court that Johnson\u2019s suspension of parliament was unlawful. The PM has indicated he may renew an attempt to suspend parliament, after condemning the ruling. The climate activist Greta Thunberg seemed to troll Donald Trump, changing her Twitter bio to reflect the US president\u2019s mockery of her emotional address to the UN on Monday. It now reads: \u201cA very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future.\u201d French police have searched the Paris apartment of the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, as well as the offices of a model agency belonging to his alleged associate Jean-Luc Brunel, himself accused of rape and of procuring minors for his friend. In a major victory for Google, the EU\u2019s highest court has ruled that the \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d online does not extend beyond the union\u2019s borders. The right, enshrined in a 2014 legal ruling, required search engines to delete embarrassing or out-of-date information when requested by the individuals concerned. An early Renaissance masterpiece has been discovered in a kitchen on the outskirts of a town north of Paris. Christ Mocked, by the 13th-century artist who taught Giotto, is estimated to be worth \u20ac4m-\u20ac6m (A$6.5m-\u00a39.7m). Opinion and analysis Ihum\u0101tao truly is a piece of New Zealand\u2019s soul, writes Lucy Mackintosh. The site on the edge of Auckland hit national and international headlines when a group, who had been occupying the area for years to protest against a planned housing development, was served an eviction notice. Few seemed to understand what was happening and why it was important, writes Mackintosh: \u201cYet Ihum\u0101tao is a place that every New Zealander should know. In a city that has destroyed or forgotten most of its past, fragments of Auckland\u2019s deep histories still survive here.\u201d Trudeau\u2019s blackface photos are awful but then so are many of his policies, writes Arwa Mahdawi. \u201cThere has been a lot of looking away by some progressives regarding Trudeau\u2019s problematic policies and less in-your-face bigotry. Trudeau has defended arms sales to Saudi Arabia, one of the world\u2019s worst human rights violators. He has approved an oil pipeline expansion opposed by many environmental and Indigenous groups. He has publicly belittled Indigenous activists. He has violated ethics laws.\u201d Sport The Wallabies should know precisely what to expect from Wales in Sunday\u2019s Rugby World Cup clash, having watched the Six Nations champions\u2019 43-14 win against Georgia on Monday. Whether Michael Cheika\u2019s side possess the armoury to negate the Welsh aerial assault remains to be seen, writes Bret Harris. Andy Murray claimed his first ATP Tour singles victory since January, by beating Tennys Sandgren in the opening round of the Zhuhai Championships. Thinking time: The joy of divorce parties If you had stumbled across the get-together, you would have been forgiven for thinking you had crashed a wedding party. But, looking closer, you would have noticed something amiss. First, the groom was nowhere to be seen. And that heart-shaped pi\u00f1ata? Black. The cupcakes \u2013 reading \u201cNewly unwed\u201d and \u201cJust divorced\u201d \u2013 would have given it away. Barua wasn\u2019t getting married. She was having a divorce party. Many cultures have rituals to mark the transition from married life to singledom. In Judaism, a divorce document called a get is presented from husband to wife, in the presence of rabbis and witnesses, to spiritually dissolve the union. Divorcing couples in Japan smash a wedding ring with a mallet. Members of the north African Beidane ethnic group hold divorce parties to welcome women back into the community and signal to potential suitors that they are available to remarry. In western cultures, however, divorce is typically met with hushed silence, whispered gossip or sympathetic looks. Divorce isn\u2019t commemorated \u2013 and certainly not celebrated. Until now \u2026 Media roundup The Australian reports that \u201can Olympic hopeful who was once on Equestrian Australia\u2019s high-performance eventing squad has been charged with raping another rider\u201d. The Oz also carries a story about the death of the former ALP national secretary David Combe, aged 76. \u201cFreeze in China relations deepens\u201d is the headline on the Sydney Morning Herald\u2019s front page today, as a high-level Chinese embassy delegation describes Australia as \u201cthe pioneer of a global anti-China campaign\u201d. The ABC reveals that Chinese ridesharing platform DiDi, which operates in Australia, now \u201cidentifies verified Communist Party drivers to customers\u201d. Coming up Scott Morrison attends UN leaders week in New York. The ACT Legislative Assembly is expected to pass a bill legalising possessing and growing cannabis for personal use in the nation\u2019s capital.",

      "bodyText": "Marco Silva believed his side\u2019s attacking approach early in the game paid dividends after Dominic Calvert-Lewin scored twice in four minutes to guide the Premier League side into the fourth round of the Carabao Cup and ease the pressure on the Everton manager. After defeat by Sheffield United on Saturday left them 14th in the Premier League and Silva in the spotlight, it was the turn of the boyhood Blades fan Calvert-Lewin to take centre stage at Hillsborough. The 22-year-old struck after six minutes following a counter-attack which saw him cushion Djibril Sidibe\u2019s ball and fire home off the underside of the crossbar. There was a gleeful celebration in front of the Kop before he slotted home Alex Iwobi\u2019s low ball from close range to double the score and essentially seal the tie with 80 minutes remaining. Cameron Dawson denied Calvert-Lewin a hat-trick late in the first half but the damage had already been inflicted on Garry Monk\u2019s team. Silva was pleased with his side\u2019s response to Saturday\u2019s defeat and said: \u201cIt was really important for us to start well the game with two early goals. We were the best team all the first half, we created more chances, Dominic had more chances, Richarlison as well. \u201cWe controlled the game and I don\u2019t remember so many chances for them.

He had one or two chances to score to make the hat-trick but he did well to score in the important moment of the game and really important to win more confidence.\u201dIn the last three games he has scored three goals so let\u2019s hope he continues in this way.\u201d It may have been a different story had the Owls taken advantage of a golden opportunity after two minutes but Jordan Pickford thwarted Sam Winnall. Dominic Iorfa flashed a back-post header wide, Adam Reach could only guide the ball into Pickford\u2019s hands in front of goal and Winnall nodded a fierce header past the post. Monk, who won the League Cup as a Swansea player in 2013, said: \u201cOverall a lot of good things happened in that game for us. It wasn\u2019t just about making changes. There were a few other situations I had to consider. \u201cThe truth is on the pitch. A few of them deserve their opportunity and to play and you need to see it. At the end of the day we are going to need the whole squad for the season. \u201cI thought they did themselves proud tonight. Of course we are disappointed with the result: no-one wants to lose a game, no-one likes losing games. I think the difference really was they were more clinical with the chances they took and we weren\u2019t.\u201d Crawley deepen Stoke gloom League Two Crawley joined Colchester in the fourth round thanks to a 5-4 penalty shootout victory over troubled Stoke. Sam Vokes opened the scoring for Stoke in the 23rd minute but Nathan Ferguson equalised for the home side before half-time. Stoke played the last 28 minutes with 10 men after Nathan Collins\u2019 dismissal. Vokes then missed the very first spot-kick, which proved decisive as Crawley scored all five of theirs. It was a happier night for Watford who battled to a 2-1 success against Swansea at Vicarage Road in the wake of their 8-0 defeat by Manchester City.

Their manager was full of praise. \u201cWe can count on some extraordinary players,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cWe took the match seriously as always and, thanks to the young guys, we are through to the next round. The back four know each other from the academy and they combined perfectly.\u201d If Harwood-Bellis looked mature beyond his years in defence, Raheem Sterling was the star of the attacking show, his goal in particular a classy run straight at the heart of the Preston defence with a couple of neat feints as he entered the area to buy himself more space. Josh Harrop could not quite reach an inviting Ryan Ledson cross with the first chance of the game in the opening minute and the same player struck an upright in the second half. But by that stage City had scored all their goals and were cruising. Sterling and David Silva helped set up Gabriel Jesus for the second, then Preston\u2019s goalkeeper, Connor Ripley, was beaten by a deflection off his own defender as Ledson\u2019s touch sent David Silva\u2019s relatively innocuous cross into the net. Phil Foden hit the bar in the second half, again after an enterprising run from Sterling, and when the England player was withdrawn shortly before the end he was applauded from all sides of the ground. Sterling had brought a good save from Ripley in the first half, just before Jesus headed narrowly over from a David Silva cross to the far post. Preston had made several changes too and their manager, Alex Neil, thought his players performed well but perhaps paid the penalty for being a little too adventurous against top-class opponents. \u201cWe did all right, we didn\u2019t disappoint, if anything we got a bit too hungry going forward and left gaps for City to exploit,\u201d Neil said. \u201cThey scored some quality goals.\u201d Guardiola defended Bernardo Silva when asked about his reaction to the news that the FA may discipline him over his allegedly racist tweet to his teammate Benjamin Mendy. \u201cIf they are going to do that, I think they need to know what sort of a person Bernardo is,\u201d the City manager said. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know what will happen but Bernardo is one of the loveliest people I have ever met in my life, he speaks four or five languages and Mendy is one of his best friends. They are like brothers and the response from Mendy was clear; it was a joke all the time. I\u2019ve seen many similar situations with white people and in any case the image is not about the colour of skin. \u201cBernardo is an exceptional person, completely open-minded about nationalities and skin colour. I think the authorities should put their focus on another issue because they don\u2019t know which guy they are talking about.\u201d",

They pull the plant upwards and remove the fleshy primal leaves that unfold as the first roots go down, but leave the rest of the sapling untouched. The jay is said to feed these nutritious first leaves, known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotyledon\">cotyledons</a>, to their young. Most of the saplings apparently survive this rough treatment.</p> <p>Jays are now much more numerous than when gamekeepers attempted to exterminate them in the 19th century and so the English oak has a much brighter future too.

This month jays have been busy stripping hundreds of acorns off a nearby oak and carefully burying them for future consumption in lawns, flowerbeds and handy crevices. The jays are credited with remembering where all the acorns are but each spring oak saplings appear all over the neighbourhood, so some were either not needed or forgotten. But there is another possibility. Experts have observed the jays returning to newly growing saplings in the spring. They pull the plant upwards and remove the fleshy primal leaves that unfold as the first roots go down, but leave the rest of the sapling untouched. The jay is said to feed these nutritious first leaves, known as cotyledons, to their young. Most of the saplings apparently survive this rough treatment. Jays are now much more numerous than when gamekeepers attempted to exterminate them in the 19th century and so the English oak has a much brighter future too. Next time you see a sapling growing in the middle of a field or hedgerow a long way from any possible parent it will probably be the work of the oak tree\u2019s chattering friend.",

They are only about whether the advice given by the prime minister to Her Majesty the Queen on 27 or 28 August, that parliament should be prorogued from a date between 9 and 12 September until 14 October, was lawful and the legal consequences if it was not.\u201d</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>That the court had the right to act</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u201cThe first question is whether the lawfulness of the prime minister\u2019s advice to Her Majesty is justiciable. This court holds that it is. The courts have exercised a supervisory jurisdiction over the lawfulness of acts of the government for centuries.\u201c</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>That the prorogation was not \u2018normal\u2019</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u201cIt prevented parliament from carrying out its constitutional role for five out of the possible eight weeks between the end of the summer recess and exit day on 31 October. Proroguing parliament is quite different from parliament going into recess. While parliament is prorogued, neither house can meet, debate or pass legislation. Neither house can debate government policy. Nor may members ask written or oral questions of ministers or meet and take evidence in committees\u2026This prolonged suspension of parliamentary democracy took place in quite exceptional circumstances: the fundamental change which was due to take place in the constitution of the United Kingdom on 31 October. Parliament, and in particular the House of Commons as the elected representatives of the people, has a right to a voice in how that change comes about. The effect upon the fundamentals of our democracy was extreme.\u201d</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>That Boris Johnson\u2019s advice to the Queen was unlawful</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u201cThe court is bound to conclude, therefore, that the decision to advise Her Majesty to prorogue parliament was unlawful because it had the effect of frustrating or preventing the ability of parliament to carry out its constitutional functions without reasonable justification.\u201c</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>That parliament has not been prorogued</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u201cThis court has already concluded that the prime minister\u2019s advice to Her Majesty was unlawful, void and of no effect. This means that the order in council to which it led was also unlawful, void and of no effect and should be quashed. This means that when the royal commissioners walked into the House of Lords it was as if they walked in with a blank sheet of paper. The prorogation was also void and of no effect. Parliament has not been prorogued. This is the unanimous judgment of all 11 Justices.\u201d</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What happens next?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u201cIt is for parliament, and in particular the Speaker and the Lord Speaker, to decide what to do next. Unless there is some parliamentary rule of which we are unaware, they can take immediate steps to enable each house to meet as soon as possible. It is not clear to us that any step is needed from the prime minister, but if it is, the court is pleased that his counsel have told the court that he will take all necessary steps to comply with the terms of any declaration made by this court.\u201d</p>\n    <p><i>The <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2019-0192-judgment.pdf\">full judgment</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2019-0192-summary.pdf\">summary judgment</a> can be downloaded from the Supreme court website.</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Downing Street suggested the prime minister would continue to push for a snap general election, while opposition parties attempted to inflict maximum embarrassment on Johnson.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn the coming days parliament is likely to be put on the spot to see if it will have an election or whether it will continue to keep the country in zombie-parliament stasis.

Labour has twice voted against motions tabled by the prime minister calling for a snap poll, and Downing Street has sought to portray Corbyn as part of a Westminster elite trying to block Brexit. Corbyn threw that language back at Johnson in his conference speech on Tuesday, claiming the prime minister is \u201cpart of an elite that disdains democracy\u201d. At Labour\u2019s annual conference in Brighton, MPs and party strategists crowded around television screens to watch Lady Hale deliver the court\u2019s unanimous verdict.

The Conservatives are due to hold their own annual conference in Manchester next week, with Johnson\u2019s setpiece speech scheduled to clash with prime minister\u2019s questions. The government would have to win a vote in parliament if it wanted to call a recess to allow Tory conference to go ahead. Downing Street\u2019s response to the crisis was inconsistent, with one part of the operation claiming that Johnson was infuriated by the position in which he found himself and another senior source claiming that the clash with the courts was not unhelpful to his narrative that he was fighting for Brexit against an obstructive establishment.

      "bodyText": "Thanks to everyone BTL (especially the ones who actually ate some cake - you know who you are). The 20s weren\u2019t too roaring, too many bakers got into a flap and two people were sent home but, well, things aren\u2019t always fair in love, war and the Bake Off tent :( Rhik will be back next week - in the meantime please remember to buy his book, I Never Said I Loved You, so I can get my commission, and have a very sweet week indeed. That \u201ctwo people\u201d thing was pretty literal, eh? Who else? There are two people that are beginning to fall away. Could it be ... Noel and Sandi? BTL, jdsworld says \u201cMichelle always looks so pissed off when she gets mediocre feedback\u201d, which reminds me of a comparison Rhik made a little while ago... Michelle\u2019s cake is brash, sparkly and looks like it might fall over at any time \u2013 basically Gemma Collins if she ends up on Dancing On Ice Paul praises Steph\u2019s lime sponge ... I know what I\u2019m having for dinner tonight Alice\u2019s cake is a mess and the drawing isn\u2019t great \u2026 which, weirdly, is what my friends say about my eyebrows ... Everyone\u2019s on edge. Except for David. David is weirdly calm. What\u2019s his secret? Was he the one who turned the heating up? Oh no, wait, it\u2019s because he\u2019s made A Good Cake. Rosie\u2019s accidentally made a car tyre instead of ganache. An easy mistake. Henry\u2019s cake is \u201cvery 20s\u201d, says Prue. At this point, we\u2019ll have to take her word for it. Helena\u2019s cake\u2019s a bit dry ... a bit like Noel and Sandi\u2019s 20s \u2018jokes\u2019 ... Michael\u2019s black icing is \u201cunusual\u201d, which is my favourite Paul Hollywood way of saying \u201cthis is horrible, never do this again\u201d What if the flapper girl we were looking for was here all along? #priya #bob Tiers assembled ... but Michael\u2019s tears will hopefully not assemble once again #poetry Suddenly got a weird urge to go to Waitrose ... can\u2019t think why ... The Pina Colada Gang. Feared throughout the land. On Helena\u2019s bake, Canterbury1 BTL says \u201cBram Stoker\u2019s Dracula was 1897, not 1922. Murnau\u2019s Nosferatu was 1922. Calls herself a Goth? She knows nothing!!!\u201d Maybe the producers SHOULD have kept those 20 minute history sections after all. Where\u2019s the Mojito cake, cowards? No idea why the worst song in the world is playing in my head on a loop ... curious ... David\u2019s making a cake based on a cocktail ... that he\u2019s never had. What could possibly go wrong? Helena\u2019s gone full-on teen goth, making a Dracula-inspired cake and joking about being dead. DEFINITELY angling for a role in the Boosh reboot. If you mention a drizzle in the sponge in the first act... keep yer eyes peeled #greatbritishchekhov Al Capone. Tick. Cocktails. Tick. Some flapper girls would really be the icing on the (cliche) cake. Loads of choux/shoe puns flying about before the break. You know who else had a thing for shoes, and drinking Baileys out of them \u2013 the Mighty Boosh\u2019s Old Gregg. Played by Noel Fielding. That revival/UK high school tour is only a matter of time away, isn\u2019t it \u2026 Me in primary school when I\u2019d accidentally leave my lunchbox at school for a week and then find it full of \u2018cider\u2019 (rotten apples) Steph\u2019s beignets looked A+ (for art deco) but were a D (for the death of the American Dream, or something ... listen, this just isn\u2019t a proper theme) Henry misheard, and made cement instead of sabayon Poor lovely Michael. At least he\u2019s done something. I once baked a cake for a colleague that was so bad I pretended I\u2019d left it on the bus. BTL, GreatIsMyNewt says \u201cEven though David says he has no idea his thingies will probably be perfect\u201d. David was definitely the person at school who said they didn\u2019t know what a book was and got 13 A*s, right?? [sinister chanting] Sabayon! Sabayon! Sabayon! Between the deep fat fryer and mystery ingredients I thought they were making Findus crispy pancakes served on a feather boa. Which, incidentally, is also one of the specials at one of my local East London cafes BTL, Mred74 says \u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry if I was Rosie. On the evidence of last week they\u2019ll forget about everything other than the Showstopper when the final judging happens\u201d. In other words, no use crying over spilt cake. Urgh, if only she\u2019d messed up on DAIRY WEEK!! Easy peasy Helena\u2019s poo emoji cake proves a greek tragedy (hahaha) Steph\u2019s custard is beautiful and yellow, just like the middle of a daisy (Buchanan). Maybe THIS is why Noel and Sandi haven\u2019t bothered with puns this week. That\u2019s a custard pie, says Prue, of David\u2019s creation. Thank god \u2013 I thought it was a lamb shank!!!! I\u2019ve had a sneak peak at the producers\u2019 notes for this episode and... Also, is it just me or does this mythical sea creature look suspiciously like the iPhone poo emoji? TallulahBankhead BTL says \u201cI was going to make some sun-dried tomato and black olive palmiers today, but didn\u2019t get round to it. However, I do have one square of apple in puff pastry left (not a tart, just some sliced apples chucked on puff pastry with a bit of cinnamon) which I\u2019ll dig out of the freezer in one of the ad breaks\u201d ... are you commenting or auditioning for next series, Tallulah? I guess that poor intern will clear it up. Once they\u2019ve finished ordering the tracksuits for 80s week. If you show a dropped tart in the first act, it should be launched off the counter in the second #greatbritishchekhov So far, we\u2019ve got Bugsy Malone, flapper girls, some rubbish costumes and - just out of shot - one intern, throughly bored of being sent on sodding errands to the fancy dress shop BTL, Hathycol says \u201cThese pies all sound really delicious but aren\u2019t even slightly 1920s themed as far as I can tell?!\u201d To which I say, very true - what the F (Scott Fitzgerald)! Will this be as tenuous a theme as when X Factor just let everyone do what they wanted under the guise of a \u2018Best of British\u2019 week? I tried blind baking once. Couldn\u2019t see much, mind. BTL, TBagpuss says \u201cshouldn\u2019t 1920s baking mean getting an underpaid kitchen maid or three in to do all the hard work?\u201d What is this, Bake Off or the Downton movie?! Henry ... going back to the freezer ... this can\u2019t possibly end well after the river of mishti ... These aren\u2019t the slapstick, silent movie kind, we\u2019re told, but somehow, you get the feeling someone\u2019s going to end up with egg on their face one way or another ...

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re wrapping things up for the day, but there will still be major news updates on the site. A look back at a long day of speeches: French president, Emmanuel Macron, said in light of the attacks on Saudi Arabia, the US and other countries should resume negotiations with Iran. He advocates for an end to sanctions. The day began with Brazil\u2019s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, delivering a combative, conspiratorial speech. At the heart of Bolsonaro\u2019s speech \u2013 which Brazilian fact-checkers said contained nine falsehoods and five imprecise claims - was a lengthy counter-attack against domestic and international criticism. Donald Trump has used his address to the UN general assembly to deliver a nationalist manifesto, denouncing \u201cglobalism\u201d and illegal immigration and promoting patriotism as a cure for the world\u2019s ills. In successive speeches, Turkey\u2019s president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan and Nigeria\u2019s president Muhammadu Buhari condemned Islamophobia. Erdo\u011fan said hate speech is a disease turning into a \u201craging insanity.\u201d Macron references Trump\u2019s speech and says he doesn\u2019t think crises can be resolved by turning inward. \u201cContemporary capitalism is dysfunctional,\u201d says Macron, before speaking against economic inequality, health inequality and gender inequality. This then spins into a broader discussion about France\u2019s efforts, internally and abroad, to promote gender equality. He moves on to speak about how countries of different wealth are charged with responding to climate change, even when its the wealthier countries doing things that threaten the environment in less wealthy places. Macron is very energetic again, speaking about making significant changes to how the economy approaches natural resources. \u201cI\u2019m not saying we in France have done everything perfectly, far from it.\u201d Macron has moved us swiftly from the topic of courage, to Iran. He said in light of the attacks on Saudi Arabia, the US and other countries should resume negotiations with Iran. He advocates for an end to sanctions. \u201cI am not naive at all and I don\u2019t believe in miracles,\u201d Macron says. \u201cI believe it takes courage to build peace and that is why it is important for the United States, Iran and the signatories of the agreement to show this courage.\u201d French president, Emmanuel Macron, begins by saying the world is not doing enough to fight the climate crisis. He says he doesn\u2019t want to be too pessimistic and knows people are fatigued of speeches, then starts speaking passionately with a lot of hand gestures to explain the great amount of knowledge and innovation available to the world today. \u201cWe have a deep awareness of these problems of the world,\u201d Macron says. So, what are we lacking, he asks? It\u2019s courage! He makes an appeal for people to have courage to build peace and to take responsibility for their actions. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani told reporters on Tuesday he was open to discuss small changes to the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six countries if the US lifted sanctions imposed on the country. Rouhani has been meeting with world leaders on the sidelines of the general assembly while tensions between the US and Iran remain high. This morning, Trump said in his UN address: \u201cAll nations have a duty to act. No responsible government should subsidies Iran\u2019s blood lust, As long as Iran\u2019s menacing behavior continues sanctions will not be lifted, they will be tightened.\u201d Trump exited the nuclear deal, then put sanctions on Iran. Iran has responded by scaling back its commitments under the deal, which gave Iran sanction relief if it limited the scope of its nuclear program. Donald Trump\u2019s commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, was pictured nodding off in the audience during the president\u2019s UN address. Video suggested he was asleep for at least 15 minutes, according to CNBC. Ross was also caught napping during Trump\u2019s speech in Saudi Arabia in May 2017. Updated 25 Sep: A spokesman for the Commerce department sent a statement from Ross on Tuesday night, saying reports of him napping were \u201cfake news.\u201d \u201cI wear hearing aids and, during president Trump\u2019s inspiring speech, which covered in detail the entire range of significant issues facing the world, was concentrating on what was being said,\u201d Ross said. He went on to explain that after the president\u2019s speech, he attended UN meetings with officials from the UK, India and South Korea and had a busy schedule planned of meetings with Pakistan, Poland, Egypt, Japan, Greece, and Vietnam. \u201cOn Sunday, I will depart on twelve days of official travel to London, New Delhi, Bengaluru, Yangon, Naypyidaw, Canberra, and Sydney,\u201d Ross said. \u201cThis is not the schedule of someone with low energy.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s world affairs editor, Julian Borger, reports from the UN headquarters in New York on Donald Trump\u2019s, largely philosophical tract delivered in a muted monotone: In the course of his 36-minute speech, Trump repeatedly referred to \u201cpatriots\u201d, an undefined group of citizens uniquely able to interpret national interest. \u201cPatriots see a nation and its destiny in ways no one else can. Liberty is only preserved, sovereignty is only secure, democracy is only sustained, greatness is only realised by the will and devotion of patriots,\u201d the president said. The potency of the rhetoric was at odds with the softness of its delivery, which was hushed, bordering on soporific. Trump\u2019s commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, was pictured nodding off in the audience in the giant general assembly chamber. Highlights from the past four speakers, three of whom devoted most of their remarks to the climate crisis. Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, president of the Maldives, criticized trade wars, populism, extremism and nativism, while saying they were examples of \u201cwhy the world needs the United Nations more than ever.\u201d He spoke extensively about climate change and highlighted the Maldives plan to phase out the usage of single use plastic by 2023 (his entire remarks are here). For more than thirty years we have been struggling to meaningfully address the climate emergency. For thirty years, we Maldivians have been saying that this is the fight of our lifetime, because it threatens our very existence as a nation. While the scientific evidence is irrefutable, there has been an alarming lack of global action. Qatar\u2019s emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, criticized countries helping prop up Libyan militias, who are fighting a government Qatar supports. \u201cThe latest military operations on the capital Tripoli have thwarted the holding of the comprehensive Libyan national conference,\u201d al-Thani said. \u201cThe strategic importance of the Gulf makes stability in that region a regional and international need,\u201d al-Thani said. He also called on Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain to end their blockade of Qatar. The president of the Swiss confederation, Ueli Maurer, spoke about climate change and the need for more research in development in that area. He said Switzerland has pledged to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 and described it as a \u201cfeasible target.\u201d \u201cSwitzerland, as a globally minded financial centre, can play an important role in promoting awareness of sustainable environmental management,\u201d Maurer said. Croatia\u2019s president, Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovi\u0107, begins by saying fear gets votes and clicks, but it is upon the leaders at the UN to \u201caddress the greatest challenges of the 21st century,\u201d together. Four hours into the general assembly, Grabar-Kitarovi\u0107 is the first woman to address the chamber. Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is facing a political crisis at home and had to cancel his UNGA appearance at the last minute. Netanyahu normally relishes his UN speeches, known for their theatrics and props, but he is fighting for this political life. Still, the 69-year-old right-leader clearly did not want to miss an opportunity. This year he sent a video message, focused on his arch-enemy Iran. Britain, France and Germany have said that Iran is responsible for the recent attack on Saudi Arabia. Let me say on behalf of Israel, very simply. Iran did it. A to Z. Israel will know to defend itself against this type of aggression. And we call on all members of the international community to join President Trump\u2019s effort to increase the pressure on Iran. That\u2019s the only way to stop Iran\u2019s aggression. Qatar\u2019s emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, is currently at the podium \u2013 the seventh of nearly 40 scheduled speakers today. It\u2019s been a busy morning, here\u2019s a quick recap: The UN general assembly kicked-off with four outspoken leaders: Brazil\u2019s president, Jair Bolsonaro; US president, Donald Trump; Egypt\u2019s president, Abdel Fattah Al Sisi and Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. Brazil\u2019s far-right president, Bolsonaro, told delegates he had come to introduce the world \u201cto a new Brazil\u201d. Amid of spate of Trumpian attacks, Bolsonaro spoke about the ongoing fires in the Amazon, which he falsely described as a \u201cvirtually untouched\u201d region. In an unusually monotone, droning speech, Donald Trump railed against globalism, China, Iran, immigration and Venezuela. A member of Venezuela\u2019s delegation responded by reading a book during Trump\u2019s speech. In successive speeches, Turkey\u2019s president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan and Nigeria\u2019s president Muhammadu Buhari condemned Islamophobia. Erdo\u011fan said hate speech is a disease turning into a \u201craging insanity.\u201d The current president of the UN general assembly is Tijjani Muhammad, of Nigeria. With Nigeria\u2019s president Muhammadu Buhari at the dais, Tijjani gets a special shout out. Lots of clapping from Nigeria\u2019s delegation. Muhammadu Buhari criticizes the attacks on multilateralism. He, like Erdo\u011fan, highlights the threat of Islamophobia and cites the attack in Christchurch, New Zealand. The chamber breaks from protocol to clap, loudly, when Buhari calls for Security Council reform. The Guardian\u2019s Latin America correspondent, Tom Phillips, watched Brazil\u2019s far-right president Jair Bolsonaro tell delegates he had come to introduce the world \u201cto a new Brazil\u201d. It is not one the world will much like, Phillips says: In his 33-minute address \u2013 apparently penned by some of his most hawkish, hard-right advisers - Bolsonaro offered a snapshot of the introverted, conspiracy-obsessed and profoundly hubristic administration that now governs the world\u2019s forth biggest democracy. Some had hoped Bolsonaro might strike a more conciliatory tone as he addressed the world\u2019s leaders at the UN for the first time. But within seconds it was clear they would be disappointed. Bolsonaro began with a Trumpian assault on the evils of socialism which, he claimed, had nearly overrun Brazil under the centre-left government of his nemesis Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva. Then, he lashed out at Emmanuel Macron\u2019s France and the \u201clying\u201d mainstream media for supposedly \u201csensationalizing\u201d the ongoing fires in the Amazon which he falsely described as a \u201cvirtually untouched\u201d region. To the delight of his hard-line Pentecostal backers, he went on to rail against the politically-correct and ungodly progressives who had \u201cperverted biology\u201d and \u201cwere trying to destroy innocence of our children\u201d by infecting them with gender ideology. \u201cIdeology has invaded the very human soul,\u201d Bolsonaro declared. And with many looking on in perplexity, Bolsonaro wrapped up his over-long speech with his favourite quote from the Bible. \u201cYou will know the truth, and the truth will set you free,\u201d Bolsonaro said. The muted applause left no doubt that many delegates cannot wait to be free of Brazil\u2019s leader. Erdo\u011fan is criticizing Israel\u2019s treatment of Palestinians, resulting in polite clapping from the Palestinian delegation. He also has a map of Israel, showing how much of it was Palestinian territory, over time. \u201cWhere are the borders of the state of Israel?\u201d Erdo\u011fan asks. This speech is a long list of Erdo\u011fan\u2019s geopolitical grievances and it is going on for much longer than the allotted 15 minutes. He\u2019s now speaking about hate speech against Muslims and says its a disease turning into a \u201craging insanity.\u201d He\u2019s veering close to criticism of Trump - highlighting politicians who campaign on anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant sentiment - but does not name him specifically. Turkey\u2019s president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan is up and darting between topics. The international community is gradually losing its ability to respond to challenges such as poverty, Erdo\u011fan says. He says it is unacceptable that half the world is wealthy and the other half is impoverished, that one half of the world can talk about technological advancements and obesity while the other half are living under the poverty line and experience starvation. \u201cThe world is greater than five,\u201d he says, referencing the five nations with nuclear weapons. He calls for either denuclearization or allowing all of the world to have access to nuclear weapons. \u201cThe inequality between nuclear states and non-nuclear states is alone enough to undermine global balances,\u201d he says. He talks about the climate, then says Turkey has won the title of being the most generous country in terms of humanitarian aid and in housing displaced people. Erdo\u011fan holds up a photo of Alan Kurdi, the three-year-old Syrian boy whose body washed ashore in Turkey in 2015 after drowning while attempting to cross the Mediterranean. Much of his remarks are focused on the 3.6 million Syrian refugees living in Turkey, as well as ongoing conflict in Turkey and how it should be addressed. Egypt\u2019s president Abdel Fatah al-Sisi is now at the podium, speaking about his government\u2019s efforts to improve the economy and fight terrorism. He arrived in New York after at least 55 people were arrested last week in rare protests against Sisi. Sisi calls on non-Arab countries to stop intervening in conflicts in the region. Sisi ends his his speech making \u201ca call for the pursuit of peace, a call for action for the benefit of humanity\u201d and a call for sustainable development. Well, Trump\u2019s speech was consistent in its content, but was a big departure from the energetic, rambling speeches he usually deploys. Instead, his delivery was slow and monotone. Update: the Venezuela delegate reading through Donald Trump\u2019s speech is apparently reading a book about Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar. Trump says \u201cmedia and academic institutions\u201d are assaulting history, traditions and values. This is unexpected: \u201cMy administration is working with other nations to stop criminalizing of homosexuality. And we stand in solidarity with LGBTQ people who live in countries that punish jail or execute individuals based upon sexual orientation.\u201d His pivot to religious freedom, opposing women\u2019s access to abortion and gun rights, is expected. And now we\u2019re on to US immigration. Trump makes a chilling attack on what he calls \u201cradical activists\u201d and \u201cgroups\u201d who he claims encourage illegal immigration and smuggling. It is hard to read this as anything other than a critique of the human rights groups and immigration advocates who have been working to uphold American and global immigration protections as the Trump administration aggressively attacks legal and illegal immigration. \u201cYour policies are not just,\u201d he says. \u201cYour policies are cruel and evil.\u201d He says all countries have the right to close their borders and that young people should stay where they are. This transitions to his attack on Venezuela, which a Venezuelan delegate responds to by opening book and apparently starting to read. On China, Trump says he is fighting unfair trade policies and is working to secure a deal with China. \u201cThe United States does not seek conflict with any nation,\u201d Trump says. Which leads him into Iran. \u201cAll nations have a duty to act, no countries should subsidize Iran\u2019s bloodlust,\u201d he says. He is complaining about people in Iran chanting \u201cdeath to America\u201d and says the US won\u2019t tolerate antisemitism in Iran. Trump thinks Iran needs to stop threatening other countries and to \u201cput the Iranian people first.\u201d (Reminder: Trump threatened to destroy North Korea in his first UN address in 2017). Ah! And now he mentions Kim Jong-Un. He says he\u2019s told him North Korea must denuclearize. America\u2019s goal is harmony and America\u2019s goal is not to go with these endless wars, wars that never end. \u201cSeven decades of history have passed through this hall in their richness and drama,\u201d begins Donald Trump in his third UN address. He is speaking gravely, which is interesting because last year the chamber broke out in spontaneous laughter at one of his comments. \u201cThe future does not belong to globalists, the future belongs to patriots,\u201d he says. Trump is re-treading his well-worn path of promoting \u201csovereignty\u201d above international relations. He speaks about the US economy and global trade, then says he\u2019s ready to reach a great trade deal with the UK. Interesting faces made by the UK delegation as Trump speaks about Boris Johnson, who may not stick around the general assembly long enough to make his debut speech because of the crisis in his government. And now on to China \u2026 Bolsonaro speaks about religious persecution, a clear shoutout to Donald Trump, who held a special religious freedom meeting at the UN yesterday when the UN was focused on climate change. He goes onto a long, bizarre screed against \u201cideology\u201d. \u201cIdeology has invaded the human soul itself to expel god from it,\u201d he says. \u201cIdeology\u201d has led to \u201cdeath and destruction\u201d \u2013 including when he was stabbed. Each speaker is allotted 15 minutes for their remarks, but Bolsonaro has upheld the tradition of leaders speaking well beyond that limit. His comments clocked in around 30 minutes. He ended by thanking the \u201cgrace and glory of God.\u201d Now it\u2019s time for Trump. Now Bolsonaro is speaking about the Amazon. He is effectively saying the forest needs to be open for business. To make this case, Bolsonaro cites conversations he\u2019s had with indigenous leaders. He also says countries were \u201cdisrespectful\u201d and \u201ccolonialist\u201d in criticizing Bolsonaro\u2019s response to fires in the Amazon. He thanks Donald Trump, before continuing to explain how the rest of the world has approached the situation in the Amazon in a colonialist way. Bolsonaro says indigenous people do not want to be poor people sitting on the world\u2019s richest lands. \u201cWe can not forget the world needs to be fed,\u201d Bolsonaro says. \u201cFrance and Germany use up to more than 50% of their territories for agricultural.\u201d He says 61% of Brazil\u2019s territory is preserved and only 8% of its land is for food. The Amazon is not being devastated, nor is it being consumed by fire, as the media says It\u2019s worth noting, again, that most of Brazil\u2019s indigenous leaders are appalled by what they call Bolsonaro\u2019s historic assault on the Amazon and his \u201ccolonialist and ethnocidal\u201d plans to open indigenous territories to mining companies. Jair Bolsonaro opens his first UN general assembly adress by touting his fight against socialism in Latin America. \u201cI come here before you today to introduce you to a new Brazil, a country that is now reemerging after coming from the brink of socialism,\u201d he says. \u201cMy country was very close to socialism, which led to a situation of widespread corruption\u201d and also high crime rates, attacks on family values, he says. Bolsonaro is speaking about a deal between Brazil and Cuba to allow Cuban doctors to work in Brazil, a program Bolsonaro said Brazil is no longer contributing to. He runs through the recent history of Cuba, before moving on to Venezuela, which he says also allowed many Cubans into Brazil. He calls Venezuela \u201ca former vibrant, Democratic country.\u201d \u201cIt is fair to say socialism is working in Venezuela - they are all poor,\u201d he says. Bolsonaro says freedom is only possible with a free market. Brazil\u2019s far-right president Jair Bolsonaro, who will be the first leader to speak this morning, plans to use his appearance to counter his portrayal as a rainforest-destroying foe of Brazil\u2019s indigenous peoples. In a bid to portray himself as an amigo of Brazil\u2019s indigenous communities Bolsonaro has invited one of his few indigenous supporters, Ysani Kalapalo, to accompany him to New York. Bolsonaro was also photographed wearing an indigenous necklace as he left his hotel last night. But most of Brazil\u2019s indigenous leaders are appalled by what they call Bolsonaro\u2019s historic assault on the Amazon and his \u201ccolonialist and ethnocidal\u201d plans to open indigenous territories to mining companies. \u201cBrazil\u2019s indigenous people do not support this government,\u201d S\u00f4nia Guajajara, one of Brazil\u2019s best-known indigenous leaders, told the Guardian yesterday. Of Bolsonaro\u2019s decision to invite a rare indigenous supporter to New York, Guajajara said: \u201cThis is an attempt to trick the world and show he has support. But \u2026 it is another of his big lies. It doesn\u2019t matter what image he wants to project. What matters are his actions - which the world whole is seeing.\u201d Guajajara hails from the northeastern state of Maranh\u00e3o but is in New York as part of efforts to build an international alliance to counter Bolsonaro\u2019s threat to Brazil\u2019s forests and indigenous communities. \u201cBrazil is going through one of the worst moment in its history since the return of democracy and it is the responsibility of all of us to try and reverse these attacks,\u201d Guajajara said. On the podium this morning Bolsonaro is expected to paint himself as an ally of the Amazon. Guajajara begs to differ: \u201cThe truth is that this is a dismantling of the future, of all our of our futures. When you permit deforestation, you permit mining and you deny people the right to their territories then you are denying all of us the right to existence.\u201d Guterres comments on the climate crisis, the focus of yesterday\u2019s meeting, then speaks about migration. \u201cAt a time when record numbers of refugees and internally displaced people are on the move, solidarity is on the run,\u201d he says. Guterres continues: \u201cDiversity is not a threat, it is a richness.\u201d Guterres calls on the collected nations to address gender discrimination, noting the lack of gender equality is evident in the demographics in United Nations meetings that week. The secretary general wraps up his comments, which means it is time for the general debate to open up to world leaders. The first five countries to speak: Brazil: president Jair Bolsonaro United States: president Donald Trump Egypt: president Abdel Fattah Al Sisi Turkey: president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan Nigeria: president Muhammadu Buhari Guterres is now addressing international conflicts, criticizing unnamed leaders who have failed to uphold agreements they have made at the United Nations. He says prevention, mediation and a surge in diplomacy must be emphasized to address conflict. \u201cThere is a new risk looming on the horizon, it may not be large, but it is real,\u201d Guterres warns. He says he fears the world splitting in two because of divisions between the two wealthiest countries in the world (the UN camera zooms in on China\u2019s delegation at this moment). Presumably, the other country is the United States, though he didn\u2019t actually name either nation. \u201cWe must do everything possible to avert the great fracture and maintain a universal system \u2013 a universal economy with universal respect for international law; a multipolar world with strong multilateral institutions,\u201d Guterres says. UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres opens the general assembly by emphasizing the UN charter\u2019s message to \u201cput people first\u201d and the importance of human rights. Speaking to autocrats, Guterres says: \u201cThose are rights are not a favor to be rewarded or withhold, they are an endowment for simply being human.\u201d He references conversations he\u2019s had with refugees in the Middle East and families impacted by climate change in the South Pacific. We are living in a world of disquiet. People are worried about their jobs and getting left behind, he says. \u201cWe the leaders must deliver for we the peoples.\u201d Before the general assembly, the UN held a special Climate Action summit on Monday. World leaders who had new initiatives to address climate change were invited to speak at the forum, which was designed to push governments to do more to meet the commitments of the Paris climate accords, where countries agreed to limit the average global temperature rise to 2C above the pre-industrial era. The world has already warmed by around 1C since this time. UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said on Monday that recent action by some countries and businesses, as well as the stunning rise of the youth climate movement, gave him hope, while highlighting that neither Brazil nor the US have \u201cturned up\u201d with any new commitments for the UN summit. He said: Clearly, we are lagging behind and that there are many resistances in many areas. I feel that we are still running late and we need to accelerate. The next few years are absolutely crucial to reverse the present trend, that is still a negative trend. Hello and welcome. Welcome to our live coverage of the United Nations general assembly\u2019s general debate, where world leaders will discuss global issues and how their respective nations plan to respond. The session will begin at about 9am local time in New York (2pm in London) with opening remarks by the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres. As is customary, Brazil will be the first country to speak, with its president, Jair Bolsonaro, making his general assembly debut. Boris Johnson is scheduled to make his UN debut at the end of today\u2019s session before boarding an overnight flight to the UK because of the latest crisis in his government \u2013 the British supreme court\u2019s decision that his suspension of parliament was unlawful. Donald Trump is scheduled to speak second this morning and Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdog\u0306an, is the fourth scheduled speaker. We\u2019ll have live updates of today\u2019s speeches here, with analysis from the Guardian\u2019s team of experts, including world affairs editor, Julian Borger, and diplomatic editor, Patrick Wintour, who are reporting from the UN\u2019s New York headquarters. As we wait for Guterres to take the stage, you can read Julian\u2019s piece on Trump\u2019s brief engagement with the UN climate summit on Monday.",

      "body": "<p>In the final showdown between The Incredible Sulk and The Incredible Silk there could only be one winner. This time it was personal. Taking her seat as president of the supreme court, Lady Hale placed a black cap on her head. Part Bond assassin, part To the Manor Born.</p> <p>Even though her voice crackled and broke as the live feed briefly went down, her judgment was crystal clear. No lawyers were required for interpretation.</p> <p>It was a death sentence for the government\u2019s credibility. More damning than anyone in Number 10 had feared. Boris Johnson had misled the Queen, the prorogation was unlawful and there was no need for parliament to be recalled because it could be considered to be still sitting.</p> <p>The verdict had been unanimous. 11-0. Not even Lords Carnwath and Reed, whom the government had reckoned to be home team bankers as they had disagreed with the article 50 judgment, could find a good word to say about The Sulk.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"8e0bccd6cd1c99ced26c678f7fd113cea6237340\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e0bccd6cd1c99ced26c678f7fd113cea6237340/452_69_1108_1384/801.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lady Hale, president of the supreme court, and her spider brooch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: -/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Andrea Leadsom\u2019s assurances on the Today programme that the prime minister couldn\u2019t possibly be guilty of any impropriety \u2013 the business secretary must have been in a medically induced coma for the past 25 years \u2013 didn\u2019t age well.</p> <p>Rising to leave the court, Hale removed her Black Widow brooch and stabbed Lord Keen, the government\u2019s lawyer, through the neck. The poisoned tip would soon do its work.</p> <p>Under the circumstances it was the kindest end for a man whose legal arguments had been cobbled together from a skimmed read of Constitutional Law for Dommies. As Keen gasped his last breath, Hale kicked off her shoes and poured herself a large scotch. It might only be 11am but it wasn\u2019t every day you got to save the free world. Being a superhero could take it out of you.</p> <p>Over in New York, The Sulk\u2019s day was already going from bad to worse and he hadn\u2019t even yet got out of bed. Minutes after the judgment, he had found himself on the wrong end of a Skype call with the Queen. Fair to say, Her Maj had been less than amused. \u201cYou promised you\u2019d keep me out of it,\u201d she had said. \u201cI knew I should never have trusted you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA lot of women have said that to me,\u201d he had replied, before the line had inexplicably gone dead. Moments later, the phone rang again. This time it was Dominic Cummings.</p> <p>Look on the bright side, the genius\u2019s genius told him. He\u2019d promised to overshadow the Labour party conference and he had delivered. He\u2019d promised to get people to stop talking about the Sulk\u2019s relationship with the American woman and claims he had bunged her a few grand.</p> <p>And he\u2019d delivered on that as well. He\u2019d guaranteed the Tory conference would be a huge success by making sure it might not happen. Classic Dom. A man for all seasons. Though mostly for a nuclear winter.</p> <p>The Sulk was running on empty. His eyes dead and his brain scrambled. He spoke but made little sense. Gibber, gibber, gibber. Like a murderer returning to the scene of a crime, he couldn\u2019t help implicating himself. He respected the decision but the judges had got it wrong. He, the Incredible Sulk, knew more about the law than 11 of the country\u2019s top judges.</p> <p>There were dark forces at work determined to frustrate Brexit. Whoops.

      "bodyText": "In the final showdown between The Incredible Sulk and The Incredible Silk there could only be one winner. This time it was personal. Taking her seat as president of the supreme court, Lady Hale placed a black cap on her head. Part Bond assassin, part To the Manor Born. Even though her voice crackled and broke as the live feed briefly went down, her judgment was crystal clear. No lawyers were required for interpretation. It was a death sentence for the government\u2019s credibility. More damning than anyone in Number 10 had feared. Boris Johnson had misled the Queen, the prorogation was unlawful and there was no need for parliament to be recalled because it could be considered to be still sitting. The verdict had been unanimous. 11-0. Not even Lords Carnwath and Reed, whom the government had reckoned to be home team bankers as they had disagreed with the article 50 judgment, could find a good word to say about The Sulk. Andrea Leadsom\u2019s assurances on the Today programme that the prime minister couldn\u2019t possibly be guilty of any impropriety \u2013 the business secretary must have been in a medically induced coma for the past 25 years \u2013 didn\u2019t age well. Rising to leave the court, Hale removed her Black Widow brooch and stabbed Lord Keen, the government\u2019s lawyer, through the neck. The poisoned tip would soon do its work. Under the circumstances it was the kindest end for a man whose legal arguments had been cobbled together from a skimmed read of Constitutional Law for Dommies. As Keen gasped his last breath, Hale kicked off her shoes and poured herself a large scotch. It might only be 11am but it wasn\u2019t every day you got to save the free world. Being a superhero could take it out of you. Over in New York, The Sulk\u2019s day was already going from bad to worse and he hadn\u2019t even yet got out of bed. Minutes after the judgment, he had found himself on the wrong end of a Skype call with the Queen. Fair to say, Her Maj had been less than amused. \u201cYou promised you\u2019d keep me out of it,\u201d she had said. \u201cI knew I should never have trusted you.\u201d \u201cA lot of women have said that to me,\u201d he had replied, before the line had inexplicably gone dead. Moments later, the phone rang again. This time it was Dominic Cummings. Look on the bright side, the genius\u2019s genius told him. He\u2019d promised to overshadow the Labour party conference and he had delivered. He\u2019d promised to get people to stop talking about the Sulk\u2019s relationship with the American woman and claims he had bunged her a few grand. And he\u2019d delivered on that as well. He\u2019d guaranteed the Tory conference would be a huge success by making sure it might not happen. Classic Dom. A man for all seasons. Though mostly for a nuclear winter. The Sulk was running on empty. His eyes dead and his brain scrambled. He spoke but made little sense. Gibber, gibber, gibber. Like a murderer returning to the scene of a crime, he couldn\u2019t help implicating himself. He respected the decision but the judges had got it wrong. He, the Incredible Sulk, knew more about the law than 11 of the country\u2019s top judges. There were dark forces at work determined to frustrate Brexit. Whoops. Not that the prorogation had ever been about Brexit. When you\u2019ve told so many lies the truth inevitably becomes a moving target. He was now a broken Christopher Walken in The Deer Hunter, reduced to playing Russian roulette with the country just to feel alive. A dealer looking for a hand so high and wild, he\u2019d never need to deal another. An oppressed minority. The hollowed-out Sulk even found himself cracking bad gags about cauliflowers to a group of startled US business leaders, insisting people obey the law while ignoring the fact he\u2019d just been caught red-handed breaking it. Someone with any self-awareness would have realised that the reason he keeps getting swamped by clusterfucks is because he himself is King Clusterfuck.

They are only about whether the advice given by the prime minister to Her Majesty the Queen on 27 or 28 August, that parliament should be prorogued from a date between 9 and 12 September until 14 October, was lawful and the legal consequences if it was not.\u201d</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>That the court had the right to act</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u201cThe first question is whether the lawfulness of the prime minister\u2019s advice to Her Majesty is justiciable. This court holds that it is. The courts have exercised a supervisory jurisdiction over the lawfulness of acts of the government for centuries.\u201c</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>That the prorogation was not \u2018normal\u2019</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u201cIt prevented parliament from carrying out its constitutional role for five out of the possible eight weeks between the end of the summer recess and exit day on 31 October. Proroguing parliament is quite different from parliament going into recess. While parliament is prorogued, neither house can meet, debate or pass legislation. Neither house can debate government policy. Nor may members ask written or oral questions of ministers or meet and take evidence in committees\u2026This prolonged suspension of parliamentary democracy took place in quite exceptional circumstances: the fundamental change which was due to take place in the constitution of the United Kingdom on 31 October. Parliament, and in particular the House of Commons as the elected representatives of the people, has a right to a voice in how that change comes about. The effect upon the fundamentals of our democracy was extreme.\u201d</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>That Boris Johnson\u2019s advice to the Queen was unlawful</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u201cThe court is bound to conclude, therefore, that the decision to advise Her Majesty to prorogue parliament was unlawful because it had the effect of frustrating or preventing the ability of parliament to carry out its constitutional functions without reasonable justification.\u201c</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>That parliament has not been prorogued</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u201cThis court has already concluded that the prime minister\u2019s advice to Her Majesty was unlawful, void and of no effect. This means that the order in council to which it led was also unlawful, void and of no effect and should be quashed. This means that when the royal commissioners walked into the House of Lords it was as if they walked in with a blank sheet of paper. The prorogation was also void and of no effect. Parliament has not been prorogued. This is the unanimous judgment of all 11 Justices.\u201d</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What happens next?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u201cIt is for parliament, and in particular the Speaker and the Lord Speaker, to decide what to do next. Unless there is some parliamentary rule of which we are unaware, they can take immediate steps to enable each house to meet as soon as possible. It is not clear to us that any step is needed from the prime minister, but if it is, the court is pleased that his counsel have told the court that he will take all necessary steps to comply with the terms of any declaration made by this court.\u201d</p>\n    <p><i>The <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2019-0192-judgment.pdf\">full judgment</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2019-0192-summary.pdf\">summary judgment</a> can be downloaded from the Supreme court website.</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s a profound constitutional crisis and this definitely deepens that crisis.

While everyone knows refereeing is a desperately tough job, some of the more sobering clips doing the rounds on social media risk bringing the sport into disrepute. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/21/france-argentina-rugby-world-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">France v Argentina</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/21/australia-grind-out-untidy-win-over-fiji-in-their-rugby-world-cup-opener\" title=\"\">Australia v Fiji</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/21/new-zealand-south-africa-rugby-world-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">South Africa v New Zealand</a> \u2026 all were shaped to a greater or lesser degree by officiating oversights that simply could not continue unchecked.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/24/rugby-world-cup-referees-japan\">Rugby World Cup referees admit they have not been good enough</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It has been doubly galling for World Rugby because, barely a week ago, their high\u2011performance match official manager, Alain Rolland, was highlighting precisely these issues and promising they would be consistently policed. The offside line would be enforced, the breakdown would not be a free for all, cynical foul play would be pulled up. Dangerous or reckless high tackles involving contact with the head would be summarily dealt with.</p> <p>What has happened instead? People were standing so far offside at times in the France versus Argentina game it was a wonder one or two players did not also sing their opponents\u2019 anthem. Had Peceli Yato not been invalided out of Saturday\u2019s game in Sapporo after Reece Hodge caught him high, who knows how much it might have transformed Fiji\u2019s hopes? If one or two off\u2011the\u2011ball incidents during the All Blacks game had been picked up, it might also have been a significantly different story.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab4447a8db57450b8c1d933330e1d9fed0903240\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab4447a8db57450b8c1d933330e1d9fed0903240/242_49_1662_997/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Reece Hodge\u2019s high tackle on Peceli Yato that led to Fiji\u2019s star flanker being forced off during the first half of the game against Australia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reece Hodge\u2019s high tackle on Peceli Yato that led to Fiji\u2019s star flanker being forced off during the first half of the game against Australia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then there was the footage of the Hodge episode; had all the right camera angles been available, the Wallaby back would almost certainly have been sent off. To repeat, no one is saying rugby refereeing is remotely simple but even World Rugby is now acknowledging too many glaring mistakes are discolouring the game\u2019s highest-profile tournament. Given the desire to grow the game in Asia and to show it in its best light globally, the timing from World Rugby\u2019s perspective could hardly have been worse.</p> <p>With any luck this early flashing warning light will have the desired effect. If the offside line, in particular, is more closely scrutinised, attacking players will have a crucial extra split-second\u2019s grace before they are blitzed by the onrushing defensive line. It really should not be impossible for assistant referees to help out in this regard.

      "bodyText": "From the moment players first lace up their boots everyone in rugby learns the same mantra. It goes like this: the referee is always right, even when he is wrong. Respect for officials has to be absolute because otherwise there can be no meaningful game. For World Rugby, therefore, to flag up problems with substandard officiating four days into a Rugby World Cup is a seriously big deal. The statement was suitably diplomatic, of course. \u201cThe match officials team recognise that performances over the opening weekend of Rugby World Cup 2019 were not consistently of the standards set by World Rugby and themselves.\u201d The world\u2019s best referees, to all intents, have been told to blow their whistles in unison and march themselves back 10 metres. Fair play to World Rugby for going public rather than sitting on their hands but, frankly, they had very little choice. While everyone knows refereeing is a desperately tough job, some of the more sobering clips doing the rounds on social media risk bringing the sport into disrepute. France v Argentina, Australia v Fiji, South Africa v New Zealand \u2026 all were shaped to a greater or lesser degree by officiating oversights that simply could not continue unchecked. It has been doubly galling for World Rugby because, barely a week ago, their high\u2011performance match official manager, Alain Rolland, was highlighting precisely these issues and promising they would be consistently policed. The offside line would be enforced, the breakdown would not be a free for all, cynical foul play would be pulled up. Dangerous or reckless high tackles involving contact with the head would be summarily dealt with. What has happened instead? People were standing so far offside at times in the France versus Argentina game it was a wonder one or two players did not also sing their opponents\u2019 anthem. Had Peceli Yato not been invalided out of Saturday\u2019s game in Sapporo after Reece Hodge caught him high, who knows how much it might have transformed Fiji\u2019s hopes? If one or two off\u2011the\u2011ball incidents during the All Blacks game had been picked up, it might also have been a significantly different story. Then there was the footage of the Hodge episode; had all the right camera angles been available, the Wallaby back would almost certainly have been sent off. To repeat, no one is saying rugby refereeing is remotely simple but even World Rugby is now acknowledging too many glaring mistakes are discolouring the game\u2019s highest-profile tournament. Given the desire to grow the game in Asia and to show it in its best light globally, the timing from World Rugby\u2019s perspective could hardly have been worse. With any luck this early flashing warning light will have the desired effect. If the offside line, in particular, is more closely scrutinised, attacking players will have a crucial extra split-second\u2019s grace before they are blitzed by the onrushing defensive line. It really should not be impossible for assistant referees to help out in this regard. Ditto in the case of props whose scrummaging elbows sink straight to ground on the opposite side to the referee, or back-rows who slyly take out potential support runners way off the ball. But what if all this is merely the tip of the tournament iceberg? Barely an hour after the statement was released Samoa should have had at least one, if not two, of their players sent off for high tackles in the first half of their win over Russia. On both occasions, controversially, the French referee Romain Poite was persuaded the ball-carrier had dipped slightly before impact and produced only yellow cards instead. As the former Wales international Gareth Thomas observed on ITV, however, it is a basic human instinct to try to duck an impending collision, particularly when it is coming at collar height. Which begs the question the sport is increasingly having to confront: could it be that rugby at the top level is now so insanely fast, furious and physical that the legal margins are too fine for players and referees to judge consistently? It has been desperate to see the unfortunate Hamish Watson invalided out of the tournament after being hurt, without the ball, in a double clear\u2011out by two Irish front-rows but here is hoping the Scotland flanker\u2019s injury will lead to greater focus on the breakdown and underline the vulnerability of those being blasted or twisted out of the way.

YorkshireExPat Kinky Boots (2012) \u2018Very poignant\u2019: Jen P Kinky Boots is easy to dismiss as flippant, but it\u2019s a very poignant story dealing with a lot of deep issues, with heart and laughter, tears and great fun combined. Matt Henry as Lola was just incredible \u2013 Olivier and MBE very well deserved. I\u2019m not in London nowadays but made the trip to see this several times. I\u2019m very excited to catch it on tour next month, can\u2019t wait! Come from Away (2013) \u2018Exhilarating\u2019: david100 It proved to be one of the most exhilarating nights I have ever spent in the theatre. to a simple, rock \u2019n\u2019 roll \u2026 song (2017) \u2018Hypnotic\u2019: cinephiliac Michael Clark\u2019s work was absolutely stunning. Its combination of precision and energy was a joy; I found it a wonderfully dynamic and hypnotic work. Avenue Q (2003) \u2018Our teachers whooped\u2019: Cardellina We saw Avenue Q on a school trip and our English teachers whooped and clapped embarrassingly loudly after What Do You Do With a BA in English? The Lehman Trilogy (2013) \u2018Not sure I\u2019d seen anything like it before\u2019: RobRoy1975 The Lehman Trilogy was an impressive bit of theatre \u2013 not sure I\u2019d seen anything like it before. After The Encounter it was the best piece of pure storytelling I have seen this millennium. KentishTownie Abide With Me (2012) \u2018Has a piece of contemporary dance ever had a bigger audience?\u2019: NDL1234 Slightly surprised that there is no mention of Akram Khan\u2019s Abide With Me at the London 2012 opening ceremony. Has a piece of contemporary dance ever had a bigger audience? Many of whom commented on just how moved they were by something they had not been exposed to before. The B-Side: Negro Folklore from Texas State Prisons (2017) \u2018Very special\u2019: MGMacall A small but perfect piece of theatre by The Wooster Group, featuring Eric Berryman. This piece had a quiet stillness, spare set and the magnificent voices of Eric Berryman, Jasper McGruder and Philip Moore all coming together perfectly to bring to life the pain and pathos of work songs, spirituals, and toasts recorded in 1964 in Texas\u2019s then-segregated prison farms. It\u2019s a piece of theatre that exemplifies the very special and unique value of live performance. Reasons to Be Cheerful (2017) \u2018Hilarious and poignant\u2019: freewheelingfrankie I loved Graeae Theatre Company\u2019s by turns hilarious and poignant Reasons to Be Cheerful, which did superb justice to most of Ian Dury\u2019s best songs and wove them into a rite-of-passage story that was much more than a contrived excuse for playing them. The Flick (2013) \u2018Blew me away\u2019: dude1981 The Flick deserves its spot. Blew me away. Felt like I was seeing someone of my generation writing a play for someone like me. The Pillowman (2003) \u2018Hilarious and scary\u2019: Bacteria The Pillowman by Martin McDonagh was the most enjoyable new play I saw this century. Hilarious, scary, constantly surprising and finally intensely moving. It screams out for a major revival. Counterpoint (2010) \u2018Thrilling, gorgeous and joyous\u2019: richardthomson Shobana Jeyasingh\u2019s Counterpoint, performed in 2010 as a Cultural Olympics test event, filled the whole of the fountains area of Somerset House. Big-scale, fast, expansive, lovely patterns, lots of performances so easy to go and see; and above all, thrilling, gorgeous and joyous. There was a lot of good outdoor and site-specific dance all over London in 2010 and 2012. It feels like a different world now, never mind a different country. It will never happen again. Girl from the North Country (2017) \u2018So good I saw it twice\u2019: Thespionic Girl from the North Country is definitely one of the best I\u2019ve seen and certainly the best vocals/songs. So good I saw it twice! Girl from the North Country: obviously phenomenal songs but the staging, the singing and the whole shebang were incredible. AngryBairsteward2 The Bomb (2006) \u2018One of the best performances I\u2019ve seen\u2019: RubyGeegee It was one of the best performances I\u2019ve seen anywhere, especially as the special audience Q&amp;A afterwards, which we thought we may as well stay for, turned out to be between the playwright, the director, Jo Berry (whose father was killed by the Brighton bomb), and Patrick Magee, the Brighton bomber. The atmosphere in the tiny theatre was electrifying \u2013 you could have heard a feather drop. Gangnam Style (2016) \u2018Electrifying\u2019: Ronan McDermott No place for Ed Balls and Katya Jones\u2019 electrifying Strictly salsa to the music of Gangnam Style? For shame.",

The three underwhelming chief executives of the past decade deserve their bashing, but chairman Frank Meysman had been in post for eight years <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/22/thomas-cook-in-last-ditch-talks-to-avoid-collapse\">when the ship sank on Monday</a>. </p> \n<p>He was appointed to restore order after Thomas Cook\u2019s narrow escape from its last financial crisis in 2011, so one could say he led the company from near-calamity to disaster.</p> \n<p>Back in 2011, Thomas Cook had provided a textbook illustration of why non-executive directors of a tour operator should prefer balance-sheet prudence over management bluster. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2011/nov/22/thomas-cook-net-cash-debt-crisis\">The company had travelled</a> from net cash of \u00a3394m in September 2007 to net debt of \u00a3900m in September 2011. The strategic imperative for a new chairman was to get the debt down and stay away from the rocks.</p> \n<p>The other lesson, circa 2011, was that \u201cone-offs\u201d happen all the time. In 2010, it was ash clouds from an Icelandic volcano. In 2011, it was the Arab spring, upsetting demand for holidays in Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia. So, again: seize any chance to reduce borrowings.</p> \n<p>Meysman started promisingly. Confidence returned and shareholders supported a \u00a3425m placing and rights issue in 2013 under Harriet Green. Meysman was able to boast in the annual report about \u201cthe tenfold increase to our share price in the past year\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5c304d94-202d-42a4-bc1b-a6569a95dc54\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Brexit</b><br>\u201cThere is now little doubt that the Brexit process has led many UK customers to delay their holiday plans for this summer,\u201d said the chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, in May. But it cannot be the whole story - arch-rival Tui has coped because its finances are healthier.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Weather</b><br>The summer heatwave of 2018 encouraged would-be holidaymakers to stay at home, undermining prices in the \u201clates\u201d market where operators try to clear unsold holidays. There seems to have been a hangover into 2019, with customers calculating that waiting to book is a productive strategy.</p>\n    <p><b>Competition</b><br>A pincer movement of Airbnb and budget holidays has changed consumer behaviour, though Thomas Cook still managed to sell 11m package holidays last year.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Banks and debt</b><br>The tour operator has been attempting to shoulder a&nbsp; huge pile of debt for the past decade \u2013 \u00a31.7bn worth at the last count. Successive managements failed to remove meaningful chunks. The banks argue they have supported an overstretched company for years and the details of why it could not be saved may have to await the report from the Insolvency Service.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Bad management</b><br>Thomas Cook\u2019s borrowings were too high. The moral of the tale is that tour operators should fund themselves conservatively. If your balance sheet is fragile, you are at the mercy of events in an industry where most of the cash arrives in the summer and then flows out in the winter.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/nilspratley\"><b>Nils Pratley</b></a>, financial editor</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The next step, in theory, was to take further chunks out of debt via internal cash generation. That never happened, at least not in a meaningful way. Merely refinancing existing borrowings did not move the dial. In that position, the board could have chosen safety and tapped shareholders again. There were opportunities, notably in 2015, when Thomas Cook seemed to be recovering, or so the market believed.</p> \n<p>Even as late as May 2018, before another \u201cone-off\u201d from the summer heatwave in the UK, Thomas Cook was worth \u00a32bn. A \u00a3500m fundraising at that point to pay down borrowings would have upset a few shareholders, but so what? It would have improved the company\u2019s financial profile massively.</p> \n<p>These are the judgments boards have to make: how much long-term funding risk will you accept?</p> \n<p>Thomas Cook left it too late to act confidently. After the soft summer of 2018, its refinancing options closed horribly as peak borrowings surged above \u00a31bn once again. The final attempt to corral banks, bondholders and Chinese group Fosun was high-risk and ultimately failed.</p> \n<p>Chief executive Peter Fankhauser was pushed out to squirm in front of the cameras at the end, and rightly so. But Meysman should have joined him. An entire board failed and he did a full stint as chairman.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Metro Bank\u2019s Vernon Hill needs a clean exit</h2> \n<p>Acquaint yourself with another banking initialism \u2013 it could be important, at least for troubled Metro Bank.</p> \n<p>MREL is \u201cthe minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities\u201d and is one way in which the Bank of England and EU regulators hope taxpayers will never again have to pick up the tab to rescue a broken lender. </p> \n<p>In short, banks have to maintain sufficient financial resources to ensure they can be \u201cresolved\u201d, in the jargon, in a crisis.</p> \n<p>In practice, the MREL demand means going into the market and raising some capital.

      "bodyText": "Let\u2019s not overlook the other big figure in Thomas Cook\u2019s boardroom. The three underwhelming chief executives of the past decade deserve their bashing, but chairman Frank Meysman had been in post for eight years when the ship sank on Monday. He was appointed to restore order after Thomas Cook\u2019s narrow escape from its last financial crisis in 2011, so one could say he led the company from near-calamity to disaster. Back in 2011, Thomas Cook had provided a textbook illustration of why non-executive directors of a tour operator should prefer balance-sheet prudence over management bluster. The company had travelled from net cash of \u00a3394m in September 2007 to net debt of \u00a3900m in September 2011. The strategic imperative for a new chairman was to get the debt down and stay away from the rocks. The other lesson, circa 2011, was that \u201cone-offs\u201d happen all the time. In 2010, it was ash clouds from an Icelandic volcano. In 2011, it was the Arab spring, upsetting demand for holidays in Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia. So, again: seize any chance to reduce borrowings. Meysman started promisingly. Confidence returned and shareholders supported a \u00a3425m placing and rights issue in 2013 under Harriet Green. Meysman was able to boast in the annual report about \u201cthe tenfold increase to our share price in the past year\u201d. The next step, in theory, was to take further chunks out of debt via internal cash generation. That never happened, at least not in a meaningful way. Merely refinancing existing borrowings did not move the dial. In that position, the board could have chosen safety and tapped shareholders again. There were opportunities, notably in 2015, when Thomas Cook seemed to be recovering, or so the market believed. Even as late as May 2018, before another \u201cone-off\u201d from the summer heatwave in the UK, Thomas Cook was worth \u00a32bn. A \u00a3500m fundraising at that point to pay down borrowings would have upset a few shareholders, but so what? It would have improved the company\u2019s financial profile massively. These are the judgments boards have to make: how much long-term funding risk will you accept? Thomas Cook left it too late to act confidently. After the soft summer of 2018, its refinancing options closed horribly as peak borrowings surged above \u00a31bn once again. The final attempt to corral banks, bondholders and Chinese group Fosun was high-risk and ultimately failed. Chief executive Peter Fankhauser was pushed out to squirm in front of the cameras at the end, and rightly so. But Meysman should have joined him. An entire board failed and he did a full stint as chairman. Metro Bank\u2019s Vernon Hill needs a clean exit Acquaint yourself with another banking initialism \u2013 it could be important, at least for troubled Metro Bank. MREL is \u201cthe minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities\u201d and is one way in which the Bank of England and EU regulators hope taxpayers will never again have to pick up the tab to rescue a broken lender. In short, banks have to maintain sufficient financial resources to ensure they can be \u201cresolved\u201d, in the jargon, in a crisis. In practice, the MREL demand means going into the market and raising some capital. Metro flopped in this routine exercise on Monday evening. It offered bonds with a seemingly juicy interest rate of 7.5% but couldn\u2019t find enough takers to raise up to \u00a3250m. Cue another slide in the share price, which has now descended from \u00a340 to 175p in the space of 18 months. The rot started in January when Metro confessed it had allocated \u00a3900m of loans to the wrong risk bracket, a basic error that has prompted a regulatory investigation. There was a temporary relief when the bank was able to raise \u00a3350m from shareholders in May but City analysts are now openly questioning the entire model. The branches look lovely, but how are you going to make healthy returns on capital? The latest mess will give more weight to the sceptics\u2019 argument. The MREL requirement must be met by the end of the year, and it\u2019s not obvious how Metro will do it. It could plead for an extension (unlikely) or have another go at raising the fund after its October trading update (risky). Or, suggest analysts, it could flog a few loans to raise capital, which is probably the surest way. But it could also do itself a favour by persuading idiosyncratic chairman Vernon Hill to leave quietly and soon. Metro needs an independent chair but Hill, outrageously, wants to hang around in the boardroom as non-executive \u201cfounder and president\u201d. That plan will deter most self-respecting candidates. A clean exit for Hill wouldn\u2019t solve the MREL crisis \u2013 but it would help matters.",

He said such an expanded zone could contain as many as 3 million people, claiming that as many as 500,000 Syrians had been born in Turkey in the last seven years. Erdo\u011fan said the plan required an international UN-led donor conference with countries currently housing Syrian refugees, especially Jordan and Lebanon, providing financial help for those returning to safe areas. Kurds in northern Syria fear Turks and their proxy forces will repeat the violent displacement that saw many dislodged from the formerly Kurdish-controlled town of Afrin last year. Syrian Kurds have conceded to joint US and Turkish ground and aerial patrols between the towns of Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ain, but reject plans for it to be extended any wider. American support to the Syrian Kurds has been a point of tension between Ankara and Washington since the US military began arming the Kurdish-led Syrian Defence Forces (SDF) in 2014. The military arm of the SDF is led by the People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG), a Kurdish militia which Ankara views as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party ( PKK). Turkey and the US have designated the PKK, which has waged a three-decade insurgency in Turkey, a terrorist group. Turkey has joined US-led operations in Syria with two Turkish F-16 warplanes flying over YPG-held Syria. The Kurds also fear many of the Syrians that might be placed in the safe zone are not native to north-east Syria, and might displace the Kurdish culture and rights.

Dr Peter Magombeyi, the president of the Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors Association, was held in an unknown location for five days last week before being discovered on the side of a road, disoriented and injured. He had been due to take an evening flight to neighbouring South Africa to receive emergency treatment for suspected liver damage and his lawyers had earlier obtained a high court order to allow travel. Late on Tuesday, dozens of police arrived at the clinic where Magombeyi has been cared for since his abduction. Witnesses said the police were led by an unidentified man in civilian dress who told Magombeyi he would not be allowed to leave the building. Human rights campaigners said authorities fear examination by doctors in South Africa will reveal evidence that Magombeyi was tortured, and expressed concern that police were apparently ignoring the instructions of a judge. Dozens of pro-democracy campaigners, trade unionists and opposition officials have been abducted by suspected state security services since contested elections last year. Most have been released after several hours, though many have been badly beaten, stripped, threatened or otherwise mistreated. Government ministers and senior officials suggested the apparent abduction of Magombeyi was carried out by a \u201cthird force\u201d to destabilise the country. Nick Mangwana, the information secretary, described Magombeyi as a \u201cliar\u201d after his release. The latest incident in Harare comes as Harvard University faces pressure to rescind a title of \u201chonorary ambassador\u201d given to Auxillia Mnangagwa, the wife of Zimbabwe\u2019s president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, for \u201cexemplary work\u201d in the field of public health. In a release last week, the Global Health Catalyst programme, which fights cancer and other diseases through outreach, collaboration and high-profile international initiatives, announced it was honouring the Zimbabwean first lady for her work in increasing access to cancer prevention and control and would organise a major conference in the former British colony. Zimbabwe\u2019s first lady founded a charity last year dedicated to public health work. Its website says it is \u201ca foundation built of the strong African traditional and Christian values of love and unity.\u201d Some media outlets in Zimbabwe reported the award would lead to investment in Zimbabwe\u2019s health sector and had been prompted by cancer-screening programmes that had benefited thousands of women. However the university\u2019s decision has surprised some observers. In addition to a poor human rights record and allegations of electoral malpractice, Zimbabwe\u2019s public health service is suffering an acute lack of investment while an economic crisis, blamed by many analysts on the policies of the ruling Zanu-PF party, has led to acute medicine shortages. Members of the political elite are routinely treated overseas. Magombeyi was leading thousands of doctors who have been on strike for better conditions and pay when he was abducted. Soaring inflation in recent months has devalued salaries that were already barely adequate. In a letter addressed to the director of global health catalyst at Harvard medical school, Prof Wilfred Ngwa and more than a dozen former US diplomats, including several former ambassadors to Zimbabwe, have expressed their \u201cprofound concern over [the] decision to honour the first lady of Zimbabwe\u201d. They wrote: \u201cTo be blunt, your well-intentioned work in these areas are tainted by the affiliation with Ms Mnangagwa and her direct personal connection to an increasingly corrupt and abusive administration in which tolerance for dissent is non-existent and democratic rights are violently denied. \u201cIn light of the concerning situation in Zimbabwe, we implore your institution to \u2026 consider rescinding this honour to first lady Mnangagwa \u2026 Too often, repressive regimes will use prestigious international institutions, like Harvard University, to launder their oppressive practices and reputations.\u201d Mnangagwa took power in 2017 when the veteran ruler Robert Mugabe was forced to resign after a military takeover in November 2017. He promised to bring foreign investment to avert a deepening economic crisis, overhaul government and rehabilitate the former British colony\u2019s international image. Zimbabwe is crippled by massive debts incurred during Mugabe\u2019s rule and needs a multibillion-dollar bailout to prevent economic collapse. However, the continuing repression and a lack of tangible political reform means there is little chance of international institutions offering major aid packages.",

      "bodyText": "The Australian Taxation Office has accused the controversial Chinese businessman Huang Xiangmo of intentionally setting up complicated business structures in Australia to frustrate efforts to recover money from him. In documents filed with the federal court, the ATO, which has hit Huang with a $140m tax bill, said it had concerns that Huang \u201cintentionally structured his asset holdings in such a fashion so as to delay or hinder recovery by creditors\u201d. \u201cFor example, the commissioner [of taxation] is concerned that the trusts and corporate entities associated with Mr Huang mask the true level of control Mr Huang is able to exert over those trusts and corporate entities,\u201d the senior ATO officer Yi Deng said in an affidavit filed with the court. The affidavit and an outline of the ATO\u2019s arguments, released by the court on Tuesday evening, also reveal the ATO\u2019s concerns that Huang had restructured his affairs to distance himself from his Australian business empire and had \u201cgrossly understated\u201d his income. They reveal that Huang\u2019s wife, Huang Jiefang, and their son, Jimmy Huang, have both recently left Australia. And they also show the ATO only became aware of two offshore bank accounts held in Huang Xiangmo\u2019s name through casino records and issued notices to the Star casino group in a bid to claw back any money it holds on his behalf. The ATO has issued notices to casinos around Australia seeking money it says Huang owes the tax office. The tax office has issued garnishee notices relating to Huang\u2019s tax bill to Star casino in Sydney, Crown in Melbourne, and the company behind Treasury Casino in Brisbane and The Star on the Gold Coast. The documents were filed by the ATO in support of a freezing order over Huang Xiangmo\u2019s assets and the couple\u2019s Mosman mansion, which was granted by the federal court judge Anna Katzmann last week. \u201cThe ATO formed the opinion during the audit into Mr Huang\u2019s taxation affairs ... that Mr Huang had \u2018grossly understated\u2019 his income and made false or misleading statements to the Commissioner in respect of the income tax returns with \u2018recklessness\u2019,\u201d the ATO said in its submissions to the court. It argued Huang has both \u201cthe means and the motives\u201d to liquidate his Australian assets and move the money out of the country to avoid his tax bill. Since being audited he has moved increasingly large sums out of the country, the ATO said. The tax office argued Huang cannot currently return to Australia and has taken steps to sever his connection with the country. He has moved more than $46m out of the country since his visa was cancelled in December 2018, and resigned from 17 of the 18 Australian directorships he held. The final remaining company \u2013 Federation of Australian Guangdong Community Limited \u2013 appears no longer to be trading. \u201cMr Huang has significant business operations in China and Hong Kong and so has in place structures and operations that allow him to easily move assets between jurisdictions. As such, Mr Huang has the \u2018means\u2019 to frustrate the court\u2019s processes,\u201d the tax office argued. \u201cIn addition to the requisite \u2018motive\u2019, Mr Huang also has more than ample \u2018means\u2019 to effect a dissipation of funds by moving assets offshore and beyond the reach of the commissioner or this court.\u201d In arguing for the freezing of Huang\u2019s Australian assets, the tax office said any tax liability assessed against Huang would not likely be enforceable in either Hong Kong or the PRC. But the tax office conceded it was likely Huang\u2019s Australian assets would be insufficient to cover the $140m it is calculated he owes the tax office. Huang\u2019s legal team has indicated he will fight the freezing order and he is expected, too, to challenge the ATO\u2019s tax assessment. At a preliminary hearing in the federal court in Sydney last Friday, Huang\u2019s barrister, Gerald Ng, asked for the \u201cultimate fate of the freezing orders\u201d to be heard \u201cwith some degree of expedition\u201d. The case is expected back before court early next month. Huang, a Chinese billionaire property developer who arrived in Australia in 2011, assiduously cultivated influence with both sides of Australian politics during this time in the country, donating $2.7m to both the Liberal and Labor parties and appearing in photographs with prime ministers and ministers. The Labor senator Sam Dastyari was forced to resign from parliament after revelations he had asked Huang for money to pay personal legal bills and warned Huang he was under surveillance. Huang\u2019s permanent residency visa was summarily cancelled last December by the Morrison government on character grounds and his application for Australian citizenship withdrawn. Asio had warned political parties against accepting any more money from Huang. Of particular concern was his long-running involvement with the Australian Council for the Promotion of the Peaceful Reunification of China, which has been accused of being a front for Chinese government efforts to expand its global influence. Despite his exile from Australia, Huang has re-emerged as a key figure in the Independent Commission Against Corruption\u2019s current investigation into Labor party donations this month. Icac has heard allegations that Huang gave the New South Wales branch of the ALP $100,000 \u2013 personally delivered in cash in an Aldi shopping bag \u2013 in breach of electoral regulations which prohibit property developers donating. From Hong Kong, Huang has denied being the source of the money but has refused to give evidence to Icac.",

      "bodyText": "Barnaby Joyce spent less than three weeks on the ground in drought-affected communities outside of his electorate while engaged as the government\u2019s special drought envoy, according to MP travel records. And while the government is refusing to release details of how much the position cost taxpayers, the former Nationals leader claimed $675,000 in expenses for the nine months in the role, and was allocated two staff members to conduct his work at a cost of an estimated $200,000. The $675,000 figure includes Joyce\u2019s normal work as a backbencher, but the government has declined to say how much was related to his work as special envoy. The analysis comes as Joyce continues to defend his work in the position, which has come under scrutiny after it was revealed to parliament last week that he never produced a final report. Joyce has reacted angrily to the claim, saying he sent \u201can awful lot\u201d of correspondence to the prime minister, Scott Morrison, including by text message, about his findings as drought envoy. According to travel records lodged with the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority, Joyce made four short trips to drought-ravaged Queensland during his time in the role, with about a week spent on the ground. The first was a day trip to Longreach, Bedourie and St George, for which a private charter cost more than $15,000, the second a chartered day trip to Charleville costing $5,600 for a delivery of hay bales by the rapid relief team, the third an overnight trip to Gympie, also by charter, costing $5,300, and the fourth an overnight trip to Rockhampton in March 2019. Joyce made two trips to Tasmania as part of his duties, a two-day trip in March 2019, and a three-day trip in October 2018. He also made two brief trips to regional Victoria in March 2019, and visited Hay in New South Wales with the local MP, Sussan Ley, in April. Labor\u2019s shadow agriculture minister, Joel Fitzgibbon, said the analysis raised questions about Joyce\u2019s work as envoy. \u201cIt\u2019s time Scott Morrison came clean on what he was trying to achieve when he appointed Barnaby Joyce the Special Envoy for Drought, and to provide any evidence that the taxpayer gained any benefit from the appointment,\u201d Fitzgibbon told Guardian Australia. On Tuesday the opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, criticised Joyce\u2019s appointment, saying it was undertaken at \u201cgreat cost to the taxpayer\u201d with limited benefits. \u201cIt appears that he didn\u2019t produce a paper, he texted a couple of messages to the prime minister, as the excuse for having a couple of extra staff, travelling around the country,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cI mean Barnaby Joyce\u2019s appointment was clearly a farce to keep him busy, to stop him hunting down Michael McCormack. What we need is actually a drought policy from this government.\u201d But Joyce hit back at critics and the media for questioning why he did not produce a final report, pointing to correspondence he sent the prime minister while in the position from 27 August 2018 to 26 May 2019 which acknowledges his \u201cdetailed feedback\u201d about the drought. In a Facebook video posted on Tuesday afternoon, Joyce films folders of correspondence that he claims relate to his work as drought envoy and quotes from several letters from Morrison that he says are \u201ccorrespondence and reports pertinent to the drought\u201d. \u201cYou may not believe me, and a lot of people out there in media land don\u2019t, so I am going to read you some of the letters from the prime minister,\u201d Joyce says. \u201cDear Mr Joyce, thank you for your letter \u2026 and your detailed feedback on the impacts of the drought.\u201d He quotes another letter that reads: \u201cThank you for your letters, your appraisal drawn from your on-the-ground experience and local contact with farmers and drought-affected communities plays an important part in forming our national drought response.\u201d He says Fitzgibbon is a \u201cgoose\u201d for criticising him, and says: \u201cStop saying I never sent off reports.\u201d Neither Joyce\u2019s office or the prime minister\u2019s office responded to Guardian Australia\u2019s questions on Tuesday about the time Joyce spent in drought-affected communities. A spokeswoman for the prime minister\u2019s office said last week that producing a report was never part of the terms of reference surrounding the appointment, saying the role was \u201cfocused on getting into communities and talking to farmers in drought\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Kamaishi is a steel town. The first things one sees on arriving here are the large corrugated warehouses of the Nippon Steel factory, the smoke rising from the blast furnaces and, beyond them, a spaghetti mess of pipelines and conveyor belts, roads and bridges across the river that runs down to the port where the tugboats and tankers moor. At the end of it all is the great new blue sea wall and, beyond that, the sparkling ocean. Fifty years ago around 75,000 people lived here; then Nippon Steel scaled back production and now there are only 35,000. Even before the tsunami the place was in a slump. So was Scott Fardy when he first came here. Years later Fardy would become a star of the 2015 Wallabies team that made it to the World Cup final. But this was in 2009. He was 24 and he had just been let go by the Western Force without playing a single game for them all season. He could not get a job in Super Rugby. \u201cMy manager told me there was one club left, right up in the north of Japan,\u201d he says. They were called the Kamaishi Seawaves and they were playing in the second division of Japan\u2019s eastern conference. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Fardy signed up for 12 months. Once Kamaishi were the best team in Japan. Between 1979 and 1985 they won the national championship seven years in a row. Back then, like most other rugby clubs in Japan, they were owned and run by the local corporation. They were called Nippon Steel Kamaishi but everyone knew them as the Iron Men of the North because the factory and the rugby club were intertwined and, when Nippon Steel moved away, the team fell down the leagues. In 2001 Nippon Steel handed control of the club over to the town and they became the Kamaishi Seawaves. The Seawaves are unique among Japan\u2019s top two divisions: they are the only club owned and run by a community rather than a company. \u201cWhen I was here I think there were 15 guys who worked at Nippon Steel, and the rest of the guys worked at different businesses around town,\u201d Fardy says. \u201cThe captain sold office furniture, a couple of guys were in the town hall, a couple more were in security, another guy was a courier driver, a lot of the rest worked down the docks.\u201d Japan is not a rugby country but this little corner of it is. It got under his skin, and he ended up staying for three years. It was in the third year that the tsunami hit. Fardy\u2019s house was far enough inland that he was safe. The first he heard about it was when he saw \u201call the guys coming back from the factory saying \u2018the tsunami has destroyed the town\u2019\u201d. Later he went to look for himself, to check on friends of his who lived over the hill in Omachi. \u201cIt looked like the end of days,\u201d he says. \u201cEverything was flattened, gone. There was a big gas fire and everything was burned out. It was incredibly distressing. Something I never want to see again.\u201d In the days afterwards Fardy was not sure what to do. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know whether we should get out or not, because all the supermarkets were gone, everything was gone and we were eating supplies and it felt like we were doing the wrong thing.\u201d Five days later the Australian embassy offered to fly him and the team\u2019s other overseas players home. \u201cI told them: \u2018I\u2019m going to stay.\u2019 The wives and children went home but we wanted to do what we could to help the town.\u201d For the next few days he and his teammates worked at the supply depot, unloading trucks, stacking supplies, distributing bags of rice. \u201cRugby has values, like being a team, working hard, not letting your mates down,\u201d Fardy says. He does not want credit for it. \u201cThe whole community was out there doing it as a team, together. There were hundreds of people doing amazing work, much more than what we were doing. There were people picking up bodies and digging up bodies.\u201d It turned out that the best thing the Seawaves could do for the town was to get back playing. \u201cThe people wanted us to start again,\u201d he says. \u201cI think sport was a great way for people to get back to normality. They can go and watch a game and get away from what\u2019s happening, get a bit of relief.

      "bodyText": "The WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann stepped down as chief executive of the troubled office rental company on Tuesday after shelving plans for a stock market listing. The Wall Street Journal first reported that Neumann was preparing to step down. In a statement Neumann said he was \u201cproud of this team and the incredible company that we have built over the last decade\u201d. \u201cWhile our business has never been stronger, in recent weeks, the scrutiny directed toward me has become a significant distraction, and I have decided that it is in the best interest of the company to step down as chief executive,\u201d he said. Neumann says he will continue on as non-executive chairman. The company, now known as We, is one of the world\u2019s most valuable startups and Neumann\u2019s demotion marks a dramatic fall from grace for one of the most high-profile executives of the new generation of tech companies. We scrapped plans for an initial public offering last month after investors balked at the company\u2019s sky-high valuation. We had been valued at $47bn, despite losing $3bn in the last three years. That price was cut by more than half ahead of the proposed share sale but even that price seemed too high to many investors. Investors were also concerned that Neumann had taken $700m out of the company ahead of the share sale and would keep tight control even after it. Meetings between the board and We\u2019s largest investor, Japan\u2019s SoftBank, began on Monday to discuss the possibility of Neumann being demoted. Those meetings came after the Journal reported a private jet chartered by Neumann had to be grounded after a large amount of marijuana was found onboard. The report also detailed tequila-fuelled company parties and bizarre statements by Neumann about his plans to become immortal and to use We to \u201csolve the problem of children without parents\u201d. According to the tech news source the Information, WeWork executives and the company\u2019s bankers have been discussing laying off a third of We\u2019s workforce, about 5,000 people, among various plans to cut costs at the heavily loss-making company.

Softbank has invested more than $9bn in the company and has reportedly soured on Neumann\u2019s leadership in recent months.

The principle of equality between men and women is enshrined in EU law; many employment rights, maternity rights, trafficking laws and measures to combat violence against women and girls are derived from EU treaties and directives. These protections do not only fight current levels of discrimination against women; they also provide a structural basis for eliminating it from our society. However, as illustrated in a report published this week by the campaign group Best for Britain, Brexit will put these protections at risk and will mean that future EU equality and human rights protections are not binding in UK law. Through the removal of the jurisdiction of the European court of justice and no British replacement lined up to the EU charter of fundamental rights, Brexit will remove existing avenues of protection and leave women in the UK more vulnerable to abuse. We are at a profound moment in UK history, and the fight to protect the rights of women is real. The EU has made huge progress over the past 45 years in protecting rights both for women now and in the future.

      "bodyText": "Metro Bank shares plunged more than 35% to a record low on Tuesday after wary investors refused to purchase its bonds, in another blow to the bank since it revealed an accounting error in January. The bond sale was launched on Monday morning but the bank announced after markets closed that it had cancelled the sale by the afternoon after failing to drum up enough interest to reach its \u00a3200m-\u00a3250m sales target. That was despite trying to tempt buyers with an interest rate of 7.5%, which is high for a European bank. The Guardian understands that Metro had only attracted \u00a3175m worth of orders, prompting it to pull the plug. The decision to abandon the bond sale sent shares down 35% to 175p on Tuesday, with trading volumes nearly double those on Monday. Metro Bank shares have lost nearly 90% of their value so far this year. Russ Mould, the investment director of AJ Bell, said: \u201cThe cancellation of a \u00a3200m bond sale is another major blow to Metro Bank, leaving management with red faces and the shares sinking even further. \u201cFailure to get enough support for a product that is yielding 7.5% is quite remarkable when you consider how investors are struggling to find generous levels of income in the current market. It suggests that investors don\u2019t trust the bank or they believe the 7.5% yield is simply not high enough to compensate for the risks of owning such a product.\u201d Metro Bank, which reported 1.8 million customer accounts in July, insisted it was in a strong position, and said it had cancelled the sale because of tough market conditions. Metro\u2019s borrowing costs have soared since January, when it revealed it had misclassified \u00a3900m worth of loans as being less risky than they actually were. The discovery meant the bank had a smaller capital cushion to protect it from a larger pool of risky loans in the event of a downturn. It prompted an investigation by financial regulators, which was widened recently to include Metro Bank\u2019s senior managers. That investigation is continuing. Monday\u2019s bond sale was part of the bank\u2019s efforts to meet EU regulatory requirements by the end of 2019, which would help it wind down effectively in a crisis without using taxpayer cash. If Metro Bank fails to conduct a successful sale in the coming months, it may be forced to ask the Bank of England to postpone its year-end deadline to meet its so-called minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL). John Cronin, a financial analyst at the stockbroker Goodbody, said there were a number of risks that had deterred bond investors from taking part in Monday\u2019s sale. He said investors were concerned that the financial regulator the Prudential Regulation Authority could raise its capital requirements, in order to provide a larger cushion against Metro Bank\u2019s risky assets following the accounting scandal. Cronin also pointed to existing lawsuits over the accounting issue, and said further legal action could be on the cards, which could affect Metro\u2019s finances. \u201cFurthermore, given the uncertainties surrounding the macroeconomic backdrop and, more particularly, the outlook for [interest] rates, there are real concerns regarding the ability of Metro Bank to generate profits,\u201d Cronin added. Citi analysts said Metro actually needed to issue \u00a31bn worth of debt \u2013 \u00a3500m in 2019 and the same amount in 2020 \u2013 in order to meet its requirements, assuming Citi\u2019s growth forecasts for Metro stay on track. Citi said Metro could consider selling a portion of its mortgage business to meet the regulatory requirements, but that move risks putting further strain on Metro\u2019s earnings. A takeover may be more likely, but it is not clear who might be poised to snap up the high street lender. \u201cThe best owner for Metro would be a strategic buyer, but we struggle to identify obvious candidates,\u201d Citi analysts added. Metro Bank is already on the hunt for candidates to replace its chairman, Vernon Hill, who founded the bank in 2010, making it the first new bank to open on Britain\u2019s high streets in over a century. The company announced in July the 73-year old would be stepping down, at a time of shareholder pressure to overhaul its leadership. In May, Metro Bank announced it was severing links with the architecture firm owned by Hill\u2019s wife, amid criticism over \u00a325m worth of payments made by the lender to her business.

      "bodyText": "\u201cFlorals? For spring? Groundbreaking.\u201d When Miranda Priestly, Meryl Streep\u2019s Wintour-esque baddie, delivers this line in The Devil Wears Prada, it is an acid indictment of fashion\u2019s milquetoast decorative tropes. But for designer Maria Grazia Chiuri, opening Paris fashion week with her spring collection for Christian Dior, florals for spring can indeed stand for a fresh perspective on fashion in 2019. With the fashion industry under fire for its contribution to environmental damage, a designer with a passion for both clothes and nature would now find themselves in a love triangle. \u201cChristian Dior loved gardens. Flowers are part of the heritage of Dior. But when I see flowers and gardens now, I don\u2019t see just joy, or the beauty of nature. I see all the concerns about our future, and the need to take action,\u201d said Chiuri before the show. \u201cSo I was asking myself, how can we celebrate nature in a meaningful way? A temporary grove of 164 trees set the stage for the collection, ready for planting in protective burlap grow bags. This was a collaboration with Coloco, a collective of urban landscapers whose philosophy is to \u201cfacilitate active exchange between citizens and nature\u201d through communal gardens. Chiuri had hoped to stage the show in one of their urban gardens, \u201cbut the logistics didn\u2019t work out.\u201d Instead, the trees will be repurposed in sustainability projects in the Paris region, reinforcing wooded areas \u2013 the GoodPlanet Foundation in Longchamp and the Murs \u00e0 P\u00eaches site in Montreuil \u2013 and creating urban groves in the city\u2019s heart, as well as on Base 217, the former Air Force base in Br\u00e9tigny-Sur-Orge. Feminism being to Chiuri\u2019s era at Dior what pearls were to Coco Chanel, there was also a feminist angle. Muse for the clothes on the catwalk was Catherine Dior, the designer\u2019s sister, a member of the resistance and a devoted plantswoman who later became one of the first women in France to hold a professional licence for wholesale floristry. \u201cShe was a great woman,\u201d said Chiuri backstage, pointing to a photo on the season\u2019s mood board of Catherine in her gardening clothes: a man\u2019s shirt, sleeves rolled up, with belted trousers. The long skirts which have been a Dior motif throughout Chiuri\u2019s tenure came in rough hessian, paired with a shirt in utility blue.

He spoke out first for the first time in support of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, saying the US was monitoring the situation and expected China to uphold its treaty obligations \u201cto protect Hong Kong\u2019s freedom, the legal system and democratic way of life\u201d. While echoing allegations of some social conservatives that \u201cglobal bureaucrats\u201d at the UN were promoting abortion around the world, Trump broke with that part of his electoral base (and a lot of the activity of the US at the UN) by emphasising support for other sexual and gender rights. \u201c[M]y administration is working with other nations to stop criminalising of homosexuality,\u201d he declared. \u201cAnd we stand in solidarity with LGBTQ people who live in countries that punish, jail or execute individuals based upon sexual orientation.\u201d",

I was OK but still, it could have been very ugly for a lot of people.\u201d There were rumours that the women\u2019s race in the afternoon would be called off but in the end the organisers opted for a 30-minute delay while the roads were cleared. \u201cIt throws you, as you time your caffeine, your efforts, your warm-up,\u201d said the British rider Hayley Simmonds, who ended up 26th. \u201cThey might have been better to postpone it until Wednesday.\u201d The women raced in conditions that were merely sodden, with the bigger puddles coned off, but that had no effect on the 22-year-old Dygert, better known for five world titles as a track racer. There were 19 riders still to finish when she completed the 30.3km course in 42min 11sec, but it was clear she would not be beaten as she crouched on the wet tarmac to recover. In the end the silver medallist, Anna van der Breggen, was over 90sec adrift. Wednesday sees the final time-trial title, the men\u2019s elite race, with the Essex racer Alex Dowsett a medal hope. The Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a winner, Primoz Roglic, starts as favourite along with the Belgian prodigy Remco Evenepoel and last year\u2019s champion, Rohan Dennis. Critically the weather forecast is merely for occasional drizzle.",

Britain\u2019s accountancy regulator, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), said it was considering the case for investigation and enforcement action \u201cas a matter of urgency\u201d, while MPs on the business select committee said there were \u201cserious questions to answer\u201d about how the firm was run. The government has already announced a fast-track inquiry into the collapse by the Insolvency Service, which is charged with closing down the 178-year-old holiday business. Potential concerns for the FRC include the extent of \u201cexceptional items\u201d on the company\u2019s balance sheet, which could have swayed investors and affected annual results \u2013 as well as the profit-related bonuses paid to directors. Thomas Cook was audited by two of the UK\u2019s biggest accountancy firms, with EY succeeding PwC from 2017. The tour operator had a series of finance chiefs over the past two years. The pay of the last three chief executives of Thomas Cook has come under increased scrutiny. Labour\u2019s John McDonnell has urged the former bosses to repay their bonuses while the Confederation of British Industry said \u201cquestions are now rightly being asked\u201d about the \u00a335m paid out over the past 12 years to Manny Fontenla-Novoa, Harriet Green and Peter Fankhauser. The business secretary, Andrea Leadsom, defended the government\u2019s refusal to help bail out the company, insisting that it would have been \u201ca waste of taxpayers\u2019 money\u201d.

About 645 of them are now working for the Insolvency Service at the defunct group\u2019s Peterborough headquarters, assisting with Operation Matterhorn, the temporary airline set up by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to bring home stranded holidaymakers.

      "bodyText": "Brazil\u2019s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, has launched a cantankerous and conspiratorial defense of his environmental record, blaming Emmanuel Macron and the \u201cdeceitful\u201d media for hyping this year\u2019s fires in the Amazon. In a combative 30-minute address to the UN general assembly, Bolsonaro denied \u2013 contrary to the evidence \u2013 that the world\u2019s largest rainforest was \u201cbeing devastated or consumed by fire, as the media deceitfully says\u201d. \u201cOur Amazon is larger than the whole of western Europe and remains virtually untouched \u2013 proof that we are one of the countries that most protects the environment,\u201d Bolsonaro claimed. About 17% of the Amazon has been destroyed over the last 50 years with some scientists fearing the rainforest could reach an irreversible tipping point if that rises to 20% or 25%. Brazil\u2019s international reputation has been put through the wringer since the notoriously outspoken populist took office in January, with Bolsonaro locking horns with a succession of world leaders, including the French president, Emmanuel Macron. With Brazil battling to repair its overseas image after the Amazon fires crisis, some observers had expected Bolsonaro to strike a softer note at the UN summit. Instead, Brazil\u2019s president went on the offensive, starting his speech with a Trumpian excoriation of socialism and concluding with an obscure broadside against the leftist \u201cideological thought systems\u201d he alleged had invaded Brazilian schools, universities, homes and even souls. \u201cWith these methods, this ideology has always left a trail of death, ignorance and misery, wherever it has gone,\u201d Bolsonaro said. At the heart of Bolsonaro\u2019s speech \u2013 which Brazilian fact-checkers said contained nine falsehoods and five imprecise claims - was a lengthy counter-attack against domestic and international criticism of his highly controversial vision for the Amazon and Brazil\u2019s indigenous communities. \u201cAny country has problems. But the sensationalist attacks we suffered from the large part of the international media over the fires in the Amazon awakened our patriotic feelings,\u201d he said, accusing foreign critics of questioning Brazil\u2019s sovereignty over the region in a disrespectful and \u201ccolonialist\u201d manner. That line was a clear jab at Macron with whom Bolsonaro is locked in a long-running diplomatic feud that escalated last month after the French president urged international action over the Amazon fires and Bolsonaro responded by insulting Macron\u2019s wife. Bolsonaro reiterated pledges to reduce the size of protected indigenous territories and to open such areas up to commercial mining. \u201cBrazil now has a president who cares about those who were here before the arrival of the Portuguese in 1500. Indians don\u2019t want to be poor landowners living on rich soils \u2013 especially the richest soils on Earth,\u201d he said. Bolsonaro claimed the foreign NGOs and governments who opposed that view did so because they themselves had their eyes on the mineral wealth and biodiversity within Brazil\u2019s indigenous reserves. In an attempt to portray himself as a friend of Brazil\u2019s indigenous communities Bolsonaro invited a rare indigenous supporter, Ysani Kalapalo, to attend his address and donned an indigenous necklace after arriving in New York. But S\u00f4nia Guajajara, one of Brazil\u2019s best-known indigenous leaders, dismissed Bolsonaro\u2019s attempt to pose as an indigenous defender as a farce. \u201cThis is an attempt to trick the world and show he has support.

      "body": "<p>Anna Wintour is the most powerful person in fashion. Even her hair obeys her. The Vogue editor-in-chief has also just released a new online course in creativity and leadership. To be properly transformed you\u2019ll need \u00a329.99 for a month\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.masterclass.com/classes/anna-wintour-teaches-creativity-and-leadership\" title=\"\">Masterclass</a> subscription. As the Guardian\u2019s fashion editor, I had a go, to see if I could bring some Wintouresque efficiency to my own life.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018Own your decisions and who you are \u2013 without apology\u2019</strong><br></h2> <p>This, says Wintour, is the key message of the course. I try to apply it to Tuesday morning in the Guardian fashion office. Before I start, I warn the team: \u201cI\u2019m about to stop apologising every time I speak to anyone. Sorry. It\u2019s not real, it\u2019s for a piece. Sorry.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Make feedback fast and direct</strong></h2> <p>Wintour\u2019s leadership style inspired one of fiction\u2019s greatest bosses, Miranda Priestly. (See: \u201cBy all means, move at a glacial pace. You know how that thrills me\u201d and: \u201cFlorals? For spring? Groundbreaking\u201d). The real Wintour, however, believes managers should be clear to be kind: \u201cPeople work so much better when feedback is fast, direct and honest and they know where they are,\u201d she says. \u201cNobody works well when the atmosphere feels slow and lazy.\u201d</p> <p>I put this to the test on Tuesday, when my colleagues, Leah and Helen, noticed a spider brooch Lady Hale was wearing at the supreme court. In other words: breaking fashion news (category: jewellery and accessories). Instead of discussing at length whether we should cover it, I went with my first instinct. Yes! Of course we should! Within two hours it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/sep/24/say-it-with-a-brooch-how-a-fashion-item-became-a-political-statement\" title=\"\">live on the website</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Wake up between 4am and 5.30am</strong></h2> <p>Now this is something we have in common \u2013 thanks to my one-year-old son. Wintour isn\u2019t blearily shoving a bottle in a screaming baby\u2019s mouth and \u2013 at best \u2013 sticking on the Today programme, however. At 6.30am, she reads all American and British newspapers. At 7am, she plays tennis. She is at her desk with \u201cbreakfast\u201d (\u201cwhich is Starbucks\u201d) at around 8am. Such \u201chyperorganised\u201d behaviour allows her to \u201cremain responsive and available\u201d to her team. Still, I have questions. How does she read all of the major newspapers from two countries in half an hour? And: when does she sleep?</p> <h2><strong>Have a take-home bag</strong></h2> <p>Wintour\u2019s contains proofs and articles to read, pitches and CVs to consider, and other publications to look at. So she\u2019s working all night because, admirably, she doesn\u2019t want to waste her team\u2019s time when coming back to them with decisions. So. When does she sleep?</p> <h2><strong>Absorb what is happening culturally</strong></h2> <p>Wintour cares more about what prospective employees are reading than what they are wearing. And she ensures she imbibes as much culture and life as possible herself. Theatre? Cinema? Books? So. When does she sleep?</p> <h2><strong>\u2018Details of your incompetence do not interest me\u2019</strong></h2> <p>OK, she doesn\u2019t really say this \u2013 that\u2019s another Priestly quote \u2013 but the real Wintour admits that \u201cin-depth conversations and trying to examine things from every possible angle\u201d aren\u2019t really for her. \u201cFor me, being clear and decisive has always worked.\u201d This one I can try in the office, so I do, removing all of the \u201cmaybes\u201d and \u201cwould that be OKs\u201d and \u201cahs\u201d and other self-deprecating throat-clearing from my work correspondence for a whole morning. If you\u2019ve been up since 5am \u2013 like Wintour and me \u2013 such energy-saving behaviour is liberating.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Anna Wintour is the most powerful person in fashion. Even her hair obeys her. The Vogue editor-in-chief has also just released a new online course in creativity and leadership. To be properly transformed you\u2019ll need \u00a329.99 for a month\u2019s Masterclass subscription. As the Guardian\u2019s fashion editor, I had a go, to see if I could bring some Wintouresque efficiency to my own life. \u2018Own your decisions and who you are \u2013 without apology\u2019 This, says Wintour, is the key message of the course. I try to apply it to Tuesday morning in the Guardian fashion office. Before I start, I warn the team: \u201cI\u2019m about to stop apologising every time I speak to anyone. Sorry. It\u2019s not real, it\u2019s for a piece. Sorry.\u201d Make feedback fast and direct Wintour\u2019s leadership style inspired one of fiction\u2019s greatest bosses, Miranda Priestly. (See: \u201cBy all means, move at a glacial pace. You know how that thrills me\u201d and: \u201cFlorals? For spring? Groundbreaking\u201d). The real Wintour, however, believes managers should be clear to be kind: \u201cPeople work so much better when feedback is fast, direct and honest and they know where they are,\u201d she says. \u201cNobody works well when the atmosphere feels slow and lazy.\u201d I put this to the test on Tuesday, when my colleagues, Leah and Helen, noticed a spider brooch Lady Hale was wearing at the supreme court. In other words: breaking fashion news (category: jewellery and accessories). Instead of discussing at length whether we should cover it, I went with my first instinct. Yes! Of course we should! Within two hours it was live on the website. Wake up between 4am and 5.30am Now this is something we have in common \u2013 thanks to my one-year-old son. Wintour isn\u2019t blearily shoving a bottle in a screaming baby\u2019s mouth and \u2013 at best \u2013 sticking on the Today programme, however. At 6.30am, she reads all American and British newspapers. At 7am, she plays tennis. She is at her desk with \u201cbreakfast\u201d (\u201cwhich is Starbucks\u201d) at around 8am. Such \u201chyperorganised\u201d behaviour allows her to \u201cremain responsive and available\u201d to her team. Still, I have questions. How does she read all of the major newspapers from two countries in half an hour? And: when does she sleep? Have a take-home bag Wintour\u2019s contains proofs and articles to read, pitches and CVs to consider, and other publications to look at. So she\u2019s working all night because, admirably, she doesn\u2019t want to waste her team\u2019s time when coming back to them with decisions. So. When does she sleep? Absorb what is happening culturally Wintour cares more about what prospective employees are reading than what they are wearing. And she ensures she imbibes as much culture and life as possible herself. Theatre? Cinema? Books? So. When does she sleep? \u2018Details of your incompetence do not interest me\u2019 OK, she doesn\u2019t really say this \u2013 that\u2019s another Priestly quote \u2013 but the real Wintour admits that \u201cin-depth conversations and trying to examine things from every possible angle\u201d aren\u2019t really for her. \u201cFor me, being clear and decisive has always worked.\u201d This one I can try in the office, so I do, removing all of the \u201cmaybes\u201d and \u201cwould that be OKs\u201d and \u201cahs\u201d and other self-deprecating throat-clearing from my work correspondence for a whole morning. If you\u2019ve been up since 5am \u2013 like Wintour and me \u2013 such energy-saving behaviour is liberating.",

A panel of 11 judges was assembled, the largest number they can convene, to hear the case. Twelve judges are on the bench but an odd number must sit to prevent deadlock.</p> \n<h2>How did the court reach its decision?</h2> \n<p>Much of the hearing was devoted to the issue of whether Johnson\u2019s decision \u2013 exploiting residual, royal prerogative powers \u2013 was \u201cjusticiable\u201d, meaning that it could be subjected to examination by a court. Prerogative powers are often subject to legal challenge.</p> \n<p>The prime minister\u2019s right to recommend prorogation to a monarch was not in doubt. The question was whether suspending parliament for such a long period at a crucial, constitutional moment without sufficient reason undermined parliament\u2019s authority and duty to subject the government to scrutiny.</p> \n<p>The justices sidestepped challenges by government lawyers who claimed the court would have to specify precisely the number of days it would be legal to suspend parliament.</p> \n<p>Having decided those questions, the 11 justices then had to address what remedy was appropriate in such politically sensitive circumstances.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"1ad7943d-0570-44fe-820f-f40a46b17537\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>That the court judgment was not about Brexit</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u201cIt is important, once again, to emphasise that these cases are not about when and on what terms the United Kingdom is to leave the European Union. They are only about whether the advice given by the prime minister to Her Majesty the Queen on 27 or 28 August, that parliament should be prorogued from a date between 9 and 12 September until 14 October, was lawful and the legal consequences if it was not.\u201d</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>That the court had the right to act</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u201cThe first question is whether the lawfulness of the prime minister\u2019s advice to Her Majesty is justiciable. This court holds that it is. The courts have exercised a supervisory jurisdiction over the lawfulness of acts of the government for centuries.\u201c</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>That the prorogation was not \u2018normal\u2019</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u201cIt prevented parliament from carrying out its constitutional role for five out of the possible eight weeks between the end of the summer recess and exit day on 31 October. Proroguing parliament is quite different from parliament going into recess. While parliament is prorogued, neither house can meet, debate or pass legislation. Neither house can debate government policy. Nor may members ask written or oral questions of ministers or meet and take evidence in committees\u2026This prolonged suspension of parliamentary democracy took place in quite exceptional circumstances: the fundamental change which was due to take place in the constitution of the United Kingdom on 31 October. Parliament, and in particular the House of Commons as the elected representatives of the people, has a right to a voice in how that change comes about. The effect upon the fundamentals of our democracy was extreme.\u201d</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>That Boris Johnson\u2019s advice to the Queen was unlawful</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u201cThe court is bound to conclude, therefore, that the decision to advise Her Majesty to prorogue parliament was unlawful because it had the effect of frustrating or preventing the ability of parliament to carry out its constitutional functions without reasonable justification.\u201c</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>That parliament has not been prorogued</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u201cThis court has already concluded that the prime minister\u2019s advice to Her Majesty was unlawful, void and of no effect. This means that the order in council to which it led was also unlawful, void and of no effect and should be quashed. This means that when the royal commissioners walked into the House of Lords it was as if they walked in with a blank sheet of paper. The prorogation was also void and of no effect. Parliament has not been prorogued. This is the unanimous judgment of all 11 Justices.\u201d</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What happens next?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u201cIt is for parliament, and in particular the Speaker and the Lord Speaker, to decide what to do next. Unless there is some parliamentary rule of which we are unaware, they can take immediate steps to enable each house to meet as soon as possible. It is not clear to us that any step is needed from the prime minister, but if it is, the court is pleased that his counsel have told the court that he will take all necessary steps to comply with the terms of any declaration made by this court.\u201d</p>\n    <p><i>The <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2019-0192-judgment.pdf\">full judgment</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2019-0192-summary.pdf\">summary judgment</a> can be downloaded from the Supreme court website.</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Did Boris Johnson lie to the Queen?</h2> \n<p>The inner house of the Scottish court of sessions concluded Boris Johnson\u2019s advice to the Queen had been \u201cmotivated by the improper purpose of stymying parliament\u201d.</p> \n<p>The supreme court in London, however, avoided making direct, personal criticism of the prime minister.

      "bodyText": "Chloe Dygert speaks: \u201cI really prepared really well for this,\u201d she tells the BBC. \u201cI spent the past week with [her coach] three-time Olympic gold medallist Kristin Armstrong. It\u2019s always very special to wear the stripes and this is everybody\u2019s goal. I\u2019m really happy with the result and very happy for those people who believed in me. I live in Washington State and the weather\u2019s like that a lot here, so I\u2019m used to riding in the rain. I knew everyone else would be scared so I tried to make the best of it.\u201d Annemiek van Vleuten finishes 1min 52.66sec off the pace. It\u2019s a good ride, but will only get her a bronze medal. The 22-year-old American is world champion. Germany\u2019s Lisa Klein finishes with the fourth fastest time. USA\u2019s Amber Leone Neben is currently occupying third place. Will she keep it? Anna van der Breggen finishes 1min 32.35sec off the pace set by Dygert. It looks like she\u2019s going to win another silver medal, but may be able to console herself with a somewhat pyrrhic victory over her compatriot Annemiek van Vleuten. Great Britain\u2019s Alice Barnes finishes 4min 32sec down, making her ninth fastest so far. Anna van der Breggen passes Elisa Longo Borghini, who started three minutes before her. It\u2019s a good ride from the Dutch rider, but it\u2019s not going to be good enough. She\u2019s on course to beat reigning champion Annemiek van Vleuten to the silver medal, mind. Chloe Dygert is your clubhouse leader, with Alena Amialiusick in second place by a ridiculously large margin of 3min 17,56sec. Annemiek van Vleuten is 1min 10sec behind Dygert out on the road and isn\u2019t looking particularly comfortable on her bike. Lisa Brenneuar finishes 3min 19sec behind Chloe Dygert. She\u2019s in third place, but is unlikely to stay there. Chloe Dygert, the 22-year-old American finishes the course 3min 17.56sec quicker than anyone else and collapses off her bike in exhaustion shortly after crossing the line. A mechanic takes her conveyance and she lies in agony on the wet road. She\u2019s left nothing out there and looks a shoo-in for the gold medal here. Anna van der Breggen passes through the checkpoint 1min 10sec down on Chloe Dygert, who is the leader on the road. Belarus\u2019s Alena Amialiusick leads in the clubhouse, but not for long. Hayley Simmonds speaks: \u201cI found it a little bit difficult,\u201d says the UK rider in an interview with the BBC. \u201cI heard rumours the UCI might cancel it but carried on my preparations. I had just finished the warm-up when I heard there was a delay. \u201cIt throws you because you time your warm-up, caffeine intake and everything else to your start time. I wish they had postponed it to tomorrow. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure what to do. I\u2019ve never been in the situation before where I\u2019ve started my preparations and there\u2019s been a delay. Anna van der Breggen has passed through the checkpoint 1min 10sec behind Dygert, who is looking good for the win. Chloe Dygert remains on course to finish 2min 24sec quicker than current leader Alena Amialiusick. Chloe Dygert has the Swedish rider who started three minutes ahead of her in her sights and is on course to pass her. She\u2019s currently two minutes quicker than clubhouse leader Alena Amialiusick. The quickest finisher so far: Belarus\u2019s Alena Amialiusick has posted a time of 45min 29.13sec, which ultimately won\u2019t be good enough but is going to take some beating. Hayley Simmonds finishes more than two minutes off the pace set by the Belarusian. Chloe Dygert is looking the likely winner at the moment. Chloe Dygert hits the intermediate check point at 18min 57.88 sec, a full 1min 30sec ahead of the next quickest rider. Annemiek van Vleuten, the defending champion from the Netherlands, rolls down the ramp and gets her tilt for three in a row under way. Leah Thomas, from the United States, sets off hoping to improve on her fifth placed finish last year. Chloe Dygert passes Irish national champion Kelly Murphy, who started two minutes before her. Swiss rider Marle Reusser sets off, with just five cyclists left to go after her. We\u2019re still waiting for our first finisher. Anna van der Breggen, last year\u2019s silver medallist, sets sail and glides serenely through the opening bends. Scenes! Chloe Dygert has already caught and passed Germany\u2019s Lisa Brennauer, taking a minute out of the German. Behind them, Italy\u2019s Elisa Longo Borghini and the USA\u2019s Amber Neben, who is 44, are out on the road. Just 12 riders left to go. Alice Barnes, double-national British champion (road and ITT) Alice Barnes takes to the road. With all due respect to those competing, this is grim - the weather is horrible, the riders are being forced to proceed with extreme caution and only masochists and diehard cycling fans are out watching. Hayley Simmonds takes a rain-drenched corner very, very gingerly indeed. The riders are being extremely cautious in these treacherous conditions. American rider Chloe Dygert, another of the favourites, sets off and is followed by Lucinda Brand from the Netherlands. Some of the heavyweights are out on the course. Germany\u2019s Lisa Brennauer is out on the road. One of the undisputed stars of international cycling, she\u2019s among the favourites for today. Hayley Simmonds is fourth fastest at the first intermediate time split at 14.2 kilometres. South Africa\u2019s Tiffany Keep stops the clock at the first intermediate split at 14.2 kilometres - almost halfway - at 22min 41.73 sec. Not far behind her, Belarus\u2019s Alena Amialiusick is over two minutes quicker. Belgium\u2019s Julie van de Velde is next out. Somewhat strangely, she\u2019s the only Belgian riding in today\u2019s race, despite their pool of talent. Further up the course, Ireland\u2019s Anna Turvey cycles around a massive pool of water on the roadside, that has a big truck parked in the middle of it, to warn riders of its presence. Danish rider Pernille Mathiesen is the 19th rider out of the hut and may be one of the first to post a time that could be hard to beat. The first of the Brits are out: Hayley Simmonds sets off, as the riders continue to take to the road. It\u2019s a dirty day in Yorkshire and roads is slick and potentially dangerous. Most of the standing water has been pumped away, however. We\u2019re off and racing: Noura Alomairi of Kuwait rolls gingerly down the ramp and will be followed by Tiffany Keep of South Africa. The riders are setting off at one-minute intervals. Today\u2019s favourites: While Annemiek van Vleuten is the hot favourite to win her third consecutive title today, the inclement weather could put the cat among the pigeons. Her compatriot Anna van der Breggen took silver last year and is expected to run Van Vleuten close today. Last year\u2019s bronze medallist Ellen van Dijk misses out this year through injury, but Chloe Dygart (USA), Elisa Longo Borghini (Italy), Amber Neben (USA) and Lisa Brennaur (Germany) will all be cautiously optimistic of making the podium. Hayley Simmonds and Alice Barnes will hope the -admittedly small - partisan crowd can cheer them into the shake-up. A curious revelation: Seeking her third consecutive ITT world title today, reigning champion Annemiek van Vleuten doesn\u2019t actually like time trialling. Racing delayed until 3.30pm (BST) The UCI have released a statement: \u201cDue to the heavy rains experienced this morning and considering the inclement weather forecast for the rest of the day, the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) and the organising committee of the 2019 UCI Road World Championships have reviewed the conditions for this afternoon\u2019s Women Elite Individual Time Trial race. \u201cFollowing the discussions, it\u2019s been decided that the start will be delayed to 15:30 to allow water to be cleared. The organising committee and the county are deploying marshals to yellow flag areas with standing water and staff and vehicles are draining water on the roads to ensure riders\u2019 safety. \u201cGaps between riders will be reduced to 1 minute instead of 1min 30sec so that the finish time comes close to the original schedule. The UCI and Yorkshire 2019 will continue to monitor closely the events and take any appropriate decisions.\u201d UCI slammed by riders. Several of the riders who competed in this morning\u2019s men\u2019s under-23 ITT from Ripon to Harrogate have criticised the UCI for not stopping the race after heavy downpours flooded the roads on which Denmark\u2019s Mikkel Bjerg won his third title. \u201cIt is super-dangerous and I think it is irresponsible to let it go ahead,\u201d said Belgian Ilan Van Wilder told Het Laatste Nieuws, per Cycling Weekly. \u201cIt was no longer raining, but really pouring. You take the longest route to avoid puddles, against all time trial principles.\u201d Well, puddles is something of an understatement. From this morning\u2019s Men\u2019s U-23 Individual Time Trial. Up north in yonder Yorkshire is the venue for this week\u2019s UCI 2019 Road World Championships and today\u2019s main event is the women\u2019s elite individual time trial. Starting in Ripon and finishing in Harrogate, today\u2019s course is 32 kilometres in length.

That election needs to take place as soon as this government\u2019s threat of a disastrous no deal is taken off the table. That condition is what MPs passed into law before Boris Johnson illegally closed down parliament.\u201d</p> \n<p>Corbyn used his speech to set out Labour\u2019s stall for that election. He announced a radical new plan to set up a state-backed manufacturer of generic drugs, to bring down the medicines bill for the NHS, and highlighted a string of other policies the party hopes will prove popular on the doorstep, including a \u201cgreen industrial revolution\u201d, free prescriptions, Crossrail for the north and free personal care for the elderly.</p> \n<p>Framing Labour as the party on the side of the people against the elite, Corbyn attempted to neutralise attempts by Johnson to position himself against an establishment attempting to thwart Brexit.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn a shameless bid to turn reality on its head, Boris Johnson\u2019s born-to-rule Tories are now claiming to be the voice of the people. A political party that exists to protect the establishment is pretending to be anti-establishment,\u201d said Corbyn.</p> \n<p>\u201cJohnson and his wealthy friends are not only on the side of the establishment, they are the establishment. They will never be on the side of the people when supporting the people might hit them and their super-rich sponsors where it hurts \u2013 in their wallets and offshore bank accounts.\u201d</p> \n<p>A Labour spokesman did not necessarily rule out a general election before 31 October, but said Corbyn would need to be convinced that the government would comply with the Benn bill, which obliges Johnson to seek an extension of article 50 if he has not had a Brexit deal passed in parliament by 19 October.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe legislation has to be implemented, and we will be pressing the government to do that,\u201d he said. Labour has been in discussions with the other opposition parties about how best to respond to the supreme court judgment.</p> \n<p>Corbyn is not expected to table a motion of no confidence immediately, as he would be unlikely to secure the support of other opposition parties, who fear that Johnson could use the chaotic aftermath of the vote to secure a no-deal Brexit.</p> \n<p>If the prime minister lost a vote of no confidence, it would be followed by a 14-day period in which MPs could try to assemble an alternative governing majority.</p> \n<p>Corbyn wrote to other opposition leaders earlier this year saying he would seek to lead a short-term, caretaker government, for the sole purpose of extending article 50 and triggering a general election.</p> \n<p>However, the Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, has expressed concerns about whether Corbyn could win the necessary cross-party support, and rebel Tories would be extremely reluctant to propel the Labour leader into Downing Street, even temporarily.</p> \n<p>Some allies of the Labour leader believe he should instead offer to call a referendum on Brexit, with a general election to follow afterwards.</p> \n<p>But Corbyn\u2019s speech appeared to point to a determination to secure a general election first.</p> \n<p>In his speech, Corbyn also gave a staunch defence of the Brexit position passed by Labour conference on Tuesday after weeks of wrangling.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe need to get Brexit sorted and do it in a way that doesn\u2019t leave our economy or our democracy broken. The Tories want to crash out without a deal and the Liberal Democrats want to cancel the country\u2019s largest ever democratic vote with a parliamentary stitch-up.</p> \n<p>\u201cLabour will end the Brexit crisis by taking the decision back to the people with the choice of a credible leave deal alongside remain. That\u2019s not complicated. Labour is a democratic party that trusts the people.\u201d</p> \n<p>Several senior party figures, including Emily Thornberry and Keir Starmer, had hoped Labour would pass an alternative motion, committing the party to campaigning for remain ahead of a general election.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn has urged Labour activists and MPs to \u201cgo forward to win an election for the people of this country,\u201d after the supreme court ruled the prime minister\u2019s decision to shut down parliament was unlawful. In a rousing speech, hastily brought forward from the traditional Wednesday lunchtime slot in response to the supreme court judgment, the Labour leader slammed what he called Johnson\u2019s \u201cborn-to-rule government of the entitled\u201d. He said: \u201cBoris Johnson has been found to have misled the country. This unelected prime minister should now resign. \u201cHe thought he could do whatever he liked just as he always does. He thinks he\u2019s above us all. He is part of an elite that disdains democracy. He is not fit to be prime minister.\u201d With parliament due to reconvene on Wednesday morning, Corbyn said: \u201cThe democracy that Boris Johnson describes as a rigmarole will not be stifled, and the people will have their say.\u201d He did not set out how Labour plans to proceed when MPs return to Westminster, but called for a general election once a no-deal Brexit has been definitively ruled out. \u201cThis crisis can only be settled with a general election. That election needs to take place as soon as this government\u2019s threat of a disastrous no deal is taken off the table. That condition is what MPs passed into law before Boris Johnson illegally closed down parliament.\u201d Corbyn used his speech to set out Labour\u2019s stall for that election. He announced a radical new plan to set up a state-backed manufacturer of generic drugs, to bring down the medicines bill for the NHS, and highlighted a string of other policies the party hopes will prove popular on the doorstep, including a \u201cgreen industrial revolution\u201d, free prescriptions, Crossrail for the north and free personal care for the elderly. Framing Labour as the party on the side of the people against the elite, Corbyn attempted to neutralise attempts by Johnson to position himself against an establishment attempting to thwart Brexit. \u201cIn a shameless bid to turn reality on its head, Boris Johnson\u2019s born-to-rule Tories are now claiming to be the voice of the people. A political party that exists to protect the establishment is pretending to be anti-establishment,\u201d said Corbyn. \u201cJohnson and his wealthy friends are not only on the side of the establishment, they are the establishment. They will never be on the side of the people when supporting the people might hit them and their super-rich sponsors where it hurts \u2013 in their wallets and offshore bank accounts.\u201d A Labour spokesman did not necessarily rule out a general election before 31 October, but said Corbyn would need to be convinced that the government would comply with the Benn bill, which obliges Johnson to seek an extension of article 50 if he has not had a Brexit deal passed in parliament by 19 October. \u201cThe legislation has to be implemented, and we will be pressing the government to do that,\u201d he said. Labour has been in discussions with the other opposition parties about how best to respond to the supreme court judgment. Corbyn is not expected to table a motion of no confidence immediately, as he would be unlikely to secure the support of other opposition parties, who fear that Johnson could use the chaotic aftermath of the vote to secure a no-deal Brexit. If the prime minister lost a vote of no confidence, it would be followed by a 14-day period in which MPs could try to assemble an alternative governing majority. Corbyn wrote to other opposition leaders earlier this year saying he would seek to lead a short-term, caretaker government, for the sole purpose of extending article 50 and triggering a general election. However, the Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, has expressed concerns about whether Corbyn could win the necessary cross-party support, and rebel Tories would be extremely reluctant to propel the Labour leader into Downing Street, even temporarily. Some allies of the Labour leader believe he should instead offer to call a referendum on Brexit, with a general election to follow afterwards. But Corbyn\u2019s speech appeared to point to a determination to secure a general election first. In his speech, Corbyn also gave a staunch defence of the Brexit position passed by Labour conference on Tuesday after weeks of wrangling. \u201cWe need to get Brexit sorted and do it in a way that doesn\u2019t leave our economy or our democracy broken. The Tories want to crash out without a deal and the Liberal Democrats want to cancel the country\u2019s largest ever democratic vote with a parliamentary stitch-up. \u201cLabour will end the Brexit crisis by taking the decision back to the people with the choice of a credible leave deal alongside remain. That\u2019s not complicated. Labour is a democratic party that trusts the people.\u201d Several senior party figures, including Emily Thornberry and Keir Starmer, had hoped Labour would pass an alternative motion, committing the party to campaigning for remain ahead of a general election.",

They are only about whether the advice given by the prime minister to Her Majesty the Queen on 27 or 28 August, that parliament should be prorogued from a date between 9 and 12 September until 14 October, was lawful and the legal consequences if it was not.\u201d</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>That the court had the right to act</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u201cThe first question is whether the lawfulness of the prime minister\u2019s advice to Her Majesty is justiciable. This court holds that it is. The courts have exercised a supervisory jurisdiction over the lawfulness of acts of the government for centuries.\u201c</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>That the prorogation was not \u2018normal\u2019</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u201cIt prevented parliament from carrying out its constitutional role for five out of the possible eight weeks between the end of the summer recess and exit day on 31 October. Proroguing parliament is quite different from parliament going into recess. While parliament is prorogued, neither house can meet, debate or pass legislation. Neither house can debate government policy. Nor may members ask written or oral questions of ministers or meet and take evidence in committees\u2026This prolonged suspension of parliamentary democracy took place in quite exceptional circumstances: the fundamental change which was due to take place in the constitution of the United Kingdom on 31 October. Parliament, and in particular the House of Commons as the elected representatives of the people, has a right to a voice in how that change comes about. The effect upon the fundamentals of our democracy was extreme.\u201d</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>That Boris Johnson\u2019s advice to the Queen was unlawful</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u201cThe court is bound to conclude, therefore, that the decision to advise Her Majesty to prorogue parliament was unlawful because it had the effect of frustrating or preventing the ability of parliament to carry out its constitutional functions without reasonable justification.\u201c</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>That parliament has not been prorogued</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u201cThis court has already concluded that the prime minister\u2019s advice to Her Majesty was unlawful, void and of no effect. This means that the order in council to which it led was also unlawful, void and of no effect and should be quashed. This means that when the royal commissioners walked into the House of Lords it was as if they walked in with a blank sheet of paper. The prorogation was also void and of no effect. Parliament has not been prorogued. This is the unanimous judgment of all 11 Justices.\u201d</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What happens next?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u201cIt is for parliament, and in particular the Speaker and the Lord Speaker, to decide what to do next. Unless there is some parliamentary rule of which we are unaware, they can take immediate steps to enable each house to meet as soon as possible. It is not clear to us that any step is needed from the prime minister, but if it is, the court is pleased that his counsel have told the court that he will take all necessary steps to comply with the terms of any declaration made by this court.\u201d</p>\n    <p><i>The <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2019-0192-judgment.pdf\">full judgment</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2019-0192-summary.pdf\">summary judgment</a> can be downloaded from the Supreme court website.</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cFor the moment my feet are just not touching the ground.

The centrist government wants to extend this right to all women by passing a new law before the summer.</p> <p>But the parliament was braced for a tense debate over several days amid vocal opposition from conservative groups, rightwing politicians and senior Catholic figures. Demonstrators will take to the streets in Paris on 6 October in a march organised by conservative groups who say the new law will \u201cdeprive children of a father\u201d. The head of the French conference of Catholic bishops has argued it is the \u201cduty\u201d of all concerned citizens to demonstrate against the bill.</p> <p>The new law would bring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/france\">France</a> into line with many of its neighbours. In several countries including the UK, Spain and Belgium, such procedures are open to all women. French equality groups have fought for years against what they have called blatant \u201csexist\u201d discrimination against single women and women in same-sex relationships.</p> <p>Macron himself has not spoken publicly on the issue since he became president in 2017, leaving it to the prime minister and senior ministers to insist France is ready for the change.</p> <p>However, Macron last week told lawmakers from his party, La R\u00e9publique En Marche, that the draft law was fraught with risk for the government. The president had repeatedly delayed introducing the legislation for the past two years for fear of mass protests by conservative campaigners.</p> <p>In 2013, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/29/france-gay-rights\">legalisation of same-sex marriage</a> in France was unique among its European neighbours in sparking months of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/26/gay-marriage-protest-paris\">large street demonstrations</a>, which saw violent clashes between far-right groups and riot police and led to a rise in homophobic attacks.</p> <p>This weekend, the ethics board of France\u2019s National Academy of Medicine issued a report warning that \u201cthe deliberate conception of a child deprived of a father is not without risk for the child\u2019s development\u201d.</p> <p>Several government ministers shot back that this was wrong. The health minister, said it was false to claim there was a link between growing up in a single-parent family and being damaged.</p> <p>Jean-Louis Touraine, a lawmaker for Macron\u2019s party and medical professor who has helped draw up the text, said: \u201cAll the children born in these conditions tell us how happy they are, how they haven\u2019t suffered from any great lack.\u201d</p> <p>Some in the rightwing party Les R\u00e9publicains have opposed the bill. Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally party has called for the issue to be put to a referendum.</p> <p>Xavier Breton, a lawmaker from Les R\u00e9publicains, has accused the government of \u201cdenying the difference\u201d between men and women.</p> <p>Much criticism has focused on the notion of single women becoming lone parents, with hospital psychologists telling a parliament commission that a woman raising a child alone could have a negative impact on the child. Other experts insist that a large number of women in France already raise families alone.</p> <p>Leftwing parties have all backed the bill, which analysts say could help Macron recover some lost support on the left after he pushed through a series of pro-business tax cuts in the first half of his five-year mandate, which saw critics label him the \u201cpresident of the rich\u201d.</p> <p>The draft legislation would also allow children conceived with donor sperm to learn the donor\u2019s identity when they turn 18, ending the anonymity that donors in France have been guaranteed until now.</p> <p>For lesbian couples, the child\u2019s birth certificate would state the names of the \u201cmother and mother\u201d instead of the \u201cmother and father\u201d.</p> <p>The law would also allow women in their mid-30s to freeze their eggs \u2013 a procedure currently available only to women undergoing treatment that could affect their fertility, such as radiation therapy or chemotherapy for cancer.</p> <p>The government has estimated that the bill would benefit around 2,000 women annually.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The French parliament on Tuesday begin a heated debate over Emmanuel Macron\u2019s first major social reform: a law to end discrimination over women\u2019s reproductive rights by allowing lesbian couples and single women access to medically assisted procreation, such as IVF and sperm donation. \u201cThis is about what society we want to live in and offer future generations,\u201d said the health minister, Agn\u00e8s Buzyn. \u201cIt is about reflecting France as it is today and all French people in their great diversity...Same-sex parents and single parents exist today, that\u2019s a fact, it would be hypocritical not to see them and not to recognise them [in law].\u201d Under current French law, only heterosexual couples who have been married or living together for more than two years have the right to access procedures such as in vitro fertilisation, artificial insemination or sperm donation. The centrist government wants to extend this right to all women by passing a new law before the summer. But the parliament was braced for a tense debate over several days amid vocal opposition from conservative groups, rightwing politicians and senior Catholic figures. Demonstrators will take to the streets in Paris on 6 October in a march organised by conservative groups who say the new law will \u201cdeprive children of a father\u201d. The head of the French conference of Catholic bishops has argued it is the \u201cduty\u201d of all concerned citizens to demonstrate against the bill. The new law would bring France into line with many of its neighbours. In several countries including the UK, Spain and Belgium, such procedures are open to all women. French equality groups have fought for years against what they have called blatant \u201csexist\u201d discrimination against single women and women in same-sex relationships. Macron himself has not spoken publicly on the issue since he became president in 2017, leaving it to the prime minister and senior ministers to insist France is ready for the change. However, Macron last week told lawmakers from his party, La R\u00e9publique En Marche, that the draft law was fraught with risk for the government. The president had repeatedly delayed introducing the legislation for the past two years for fear of mass protests by conservative campaigners. In 2013, the legalisation of same-sex marriage in France was unique among its European neighbours in sparking months of large street demonstrations, which saw violent clashes between far-right groups and riot police and led to a rise in homophobic attacks. This weekend, the ethics board of France\u2019s National Academy of Medicine issued a report warning that \u201cthe deliberate conception of a child deprived of a father is not without risk for the child\u2019s development\u201d. Several government ministers shot back that this was wrong. The health minister, said it was false to claim there was a link between growing up in a single-parent family and being damaged. Jean-Louis Touraine, a lawmaker for Macron\u2019s party and medical professor who has helped draw up the text, said: \u201cAll the children born in these conditions tell us how happy they are, how they haven\u2019t suffered from any great lack.\u201d Some in the rightwing party Les R\u00e9publicains have opposed the bill. Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally party has called for the issue to be put to a referendum. Xavier Breton, a lawmaker from Les R\u00e9publicains, has accused the government of \u201cdenying the difference\u201d between men and women. Much criticism has focused on the notion of single women becoming lone parents, with hospital psychologists telling a parliament commission that a woman raising a child alone could have a negative impact on the child. Other experts insist that a large number of women in France already raise families alone. Leftwing parties have all backed the bill, which analysts say could help Macron recover some lost support on the left after he pushed through a series of pro-business tax cuts in the first half of his five-year mandate, which saw critics label him the \u201cpresident of the rich\u201d. The draft legislation would also allow children conceived with donor sperm to learn the donor\u2019s identity when they turn 18, ending the anonymity that donors in France have been guaranteed until now. For lesbian couples, the child\u2019s birth certificate would state the names of the \u201cmother and mother\u201d instead of the \u201cmother and father\u201d. The law would also allow women in their mid-30s to freeze their eggs \u2013 a procedure currently available only to women undergoing treatment that could affect their fertility, such as radiation therapy or chemotherapy for cancer. The government has estimated that the bill would benefit around 2,000 women annually.",

In reply Essex were 25 without loss when the rain returned.</p> <p>There are a few obstacles left for the home side. In addition to the spoilsport weather is the presence of England\u2019s greatest run-scorer in Test cricket (Alastair Cook is 5 not out) plus several other experienced batsmen as well as the leading wicket-taker in the country in Simon Harmer, who now possesses 83 Championship victims this summer.</p> <p>Harmer\u2019s wickets, though, have come at a cost in this match. He -finished with five for 105, having been blunted by Abell and assaulted by Van der Merwe. Sam Cook was more economical, finishing with four for 26 from 19 impeccable overs. And despite Somerset\u2019s total in excess of 200 there is the possibility of an adverse pitch report from the cricket liaison officer due to excessive turn which could lead to a points reduction.</p> <p>So there was plenty to ponder for Somerset\u2019s captain yet Abell batted with conventional poise, watchful and correct \u2013 and, in contrast to some of his colleagues, unflustered against the turning ball while gleaning 45. He is only 25 yet is in his third year as captain of the club. After a nightmarish first summer in charge \u2013 because he could not score any runs \u2013 he is now the unassailable man in charge in this format. He carries the burden lightly now. He should surely be involved with the Lions somewhere this winter.</p> <p>Whatever the situation Van der Merwe is the most energetic of -cricketers, who can make an impact in all three disciplines. Yesterday it was his batting that tilted the game. He is an intimidating No 10, who is very dangerous when the force is with him. He struck sixes off Harmer with brio, one of which was an outrageous reverse hit towards the Andy Caddick Pavilion. Last wicket specialist, Jack Leach, offered wily support \u2013 he has been in tougher situations than this in the summer of 2019.</p> <p>Now the focus switches to the bowling of Leach and Van der Merwe, as well as Dom Bess, who will be busy with the ball if the clouds permit.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-24T18:48:09.324Z\">at 7.48pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d8a3bcc8f0834740f3c16f4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-24T15:53:43.897Z\">4.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Stumps at Taunton</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Play has been abandoned for the day.

      "bodyText": "Contrasting innings from the captain, Tom Abell, and the irrepressible Roelof van der Merwe \u2013 plus a weather forecast that hints at a slight improvement \u2013 means Somerset players and fans have not yet given up all hope of a historic County Championship -triumph. Thanks to Abell and Van der Merwe Somerset mustered 203 runs on another truncated day after an entertaining last-wicket partnership of 59. In reply Essex were 25 without loss when the rain returned. There are a few obstacles left for the home side. In addition to the spoilsport weather is the presence of England\u2019s greatest run-scorer in Test cricket (Alastair Cook is 5 not out) plus several other experienced batsmen as well as the leading wicket-taker in the country in Simon Harmer, who now possesses 83 Championship victims this summer. Harmer\u2019s wickets, though, have come at a cost in this match. He -finished with five for 105, having been blunted by Abell and assaulted by Van der Merwe. Sam Cook was more economical, finishing with four for 26 from 19 impeccable overs. And despite Somerset\u2019s total in excess of 200 there is the possibility of an adverse pitch report from the cricket liaison officer due to excessive turn which could lead to a points reduction. So there was plenty to ponder for Somerset\u2019s captain yet Abell batted with conventional poise, watchful and correct \u2013 and, in contrast to some of his colleagues, unflustered against the turning ball while gleaning 45. He is only 25 yet is in his third year as captain of the club. After a nightmarish first summer in charge \u2013 because he could not score any runs \u2013 he is now the unassailable man in charge in this format. He carries the burden lightly now. He should surely be involved with the Lions somewhere this winter. Whatever the situation Van der Merwe is the most energetic of -cricketers, who can make an impact in all three disciplines. Yesterday it was his batting that tilted the game. He is an intimidating No 10, who is very dangerous when the force is with him. He struck sixes off Harmer with brio, one of which was an outrageous reverse hit towards the Andy Caddick Pavilion. Last wicket specialist, Jack Leach, offered wily support \u2013 he has been in tougher situations than this in the summer of 2019. Now the focus switches to the bowling of Leach and Van der Merwe, as well as Dom Bess, who will be busy with the ball if the clouds permit. Play has been abandoned for the day. Thankfully the forecast for tomorrow is much better, so Somerset\u2019s title hopes aren\u2019t over just yet. Essex will resume on 25 for none in reply to Somerset\u2019s 203, a total that owed most to an audacious 51-ball 60 from the No10 Roelof van der Merwe. It\u2019s now pelting down at Taunton. There\u2019s no play anywhere except at Hove, where Surrey are 210 for seven against Worcestershire. Ed Barnard has three-for. Bad light has stopped play at the Oval Only two overs were possible, in which time Surrey moved to 248 for two. Great stuff. It\u2019s raining, heavily I fear that will be it for the day. Latest scores Division One Somerset 203 v Essex 25-0 Kent 147 v Hampshire 80-3 No play Tuesday Surrey 247-2 v Nottinghamshire Yorkshire 261-2 v Warwickshire No play Tuesday Division Two Durham 262-8 v Glamorgan Stumps Gloucestershire 80-6 v Northamptonshire No play Tuesday Leicestershire 155 v Lancashire 2-1 No play Tuesday Middlesex 199-5 v Derbyshire Rain stopped play Sussex 193-6 v Worcestershire The covers are coming on It\u2019s a precautionary measure, but the forecast for the rest of the day is not good. Either way, I\u2019ll be back with you in 15 minutes or so. 11th over: Essex 25-0 (Browne 16, Cook 5) Spin at both ends, with Dom Bess coming on for the last over before tea. His first ball skids past Browne\u2019s attempted cut, a dangerous shot given the low bounce, but the rest of the over is repelled comfortably by Browne and Cook. That\u2019s tea. 10th over: Essex 24-0 (Browne 15, Cook 5) It\u2019s time for Jack Leach. His third ball turns past everyone for two byes, prompting Somerset to bring in a leg slip to go with the orthodox slip and short leg. Cook tries a bit of timewasting in an attempt to ensure this will be the last over before tea, but he hasn\u2019t succeeded. 9th over: Essex 21-0 (Browne 14, Cook 5) Cook jabs at a yorker from Gregory, which ends up in the hands of van der Merwe at gully. He appeals for the catch but nobody else is interested; replays confirm it was a bump ball. 8th over: Essex 19-0 (Browne 14, Cook 3) Cook is beaten again, this time by a fuller one from Overton. He has looked less assured than Browne so far. One from the over, and it might be time for some spin. 7th over: Essex 18-0 (Browne 14, Cook 2) Gregory goes a touch fuller and is punished by two lovely drives for four by Browne - the first through the covers, the second to the right of mid-on. Excellent batting. 6th over: Essex 8-0 (Browne 6, Cook 2) It\u2019s not just spin that Essex need to worry about. The bounce is already uneven, so goodness knows what it will be like by Thursday. Browne and Cook have done well to survive a tricky opening spell, especially from Gregory. 5th over: Essex 6-0 (Browne 5, Cook 1) Cook continues to lead a charmed one, fencing a lifter from Gregory over gully to get off the mark. It\u2019s been a brilliant start to the innings from Gregory, who zips another good delivery past Browne\u2019s outside edge. 4th over: Essex 5-0 (Browne 5, Cook 0) This is extremely hard work for the Essex openers. Browne survives an LBW appeal from Overton - too high - before being beaten outside off stump. Another maiden. 3rd over: Essex 5-0 (Browne 5, Cook 0) Sir Alastair Cook is beaten by consecutive beauties from Gregory that straighten from around the wicket - and he plays and misses at the last delivery of the over as well. A superb maiden from Gregory. 2nd over: Essex 5-0 (Browne 5, Cook 0) Craig Overton to Nick Browne: short, wide, four. There\u2019s plenty there for the seamers, though, and Browne is surprised by a delivery that goes through the top and pops past his nose. Somerset are right in this game; and unlike Essex, they have no stick/twist/WHERE\u2019S THAT EFFING MET OFFICE APP SIR BLOODY ALASTAIR dilemmas. 1st over: Essex 1-0 (Browne 1, Cook 0) There will be a few overs of seam before the spinners come on. Lewis Gregory starts with a tidy over to Nick Browne, who is beaten by some sharp movement off the penultimate delivery and then survives a token run-out referral after taking a quick single. There has been very little play around the country, because it\u2019s BLOODY AUTUMN. Division One Somerset 203 v Essex Kent 147 v Hampshire 80-3 No play Tuesday Surrey 246-2 v Nottinghamshire No play before tea Yorkshire 261-2 v Warwickshire No play Tuesday Division Two Durham 262-8 v Glamorgan Stumps Gloucestershire 80-6 v Northamptonshire No play so far Leicestershire 155 v Lancashire 2-1 No play Tuesday Middlesex 199-5 v Derbyshire Rain stopped play Sussex 150-5 v Worcestershire Play due to start at 3pm Your thoughts BTL That\u2019s the end of a storming innings from Roelof van der Merwe, who misses a reverse sweep and is bowled by Nijjar. It was some performance, though: 60 from 51 balls, including four sixes. 60th over: Somerset 201-9 (van der Merwe 58, Leach 11) van der Merwe launches Harmer miles over midwicket for another six. Pick that out! This is outrageous stuff, which has completely changed the mood of the match. 59th over: Somerset 194-9 (van der Merwe 51, Leach 11) Pongo! van der Merwe heaves Nijjar miles over long-on to bring up an audacious half-century: 42 balls, three fours and three sixes. A single off the next ball brings up the fifty partnership for the last wicket. 59th over: Somerset 187-9 (van der Merwe 44, Leach 11) van der Merwe\u2019s rustic assault has unsettled Harmer, who now has no close fielders when he is on strike. This feels like a very useful score for Somerset, weather permitting. 58th over: Somerset 186-9 (van der Merwe 43, Leach 11) The left-arm spinner Aron Nijjar does come into the attack, replacing Porter. A good first over, just one from it. 57th over: Somerset 185-9 (van der Merwe 42, Leach 11) Essex have gone on the defensive, and van der Merwe is dictating the play at the moment. A pair of twos and a single off Harmer take him to within of an unlikely half-century. 56th over: Somerset 180-9 (van der Merwe 37, Leach 11) Aron Nijjar has bowled only two overs, which suggests a loss of faith from Ryan ten Doeschate. Mind you, the old ball is doing a fair bit for the seamers. 55th over: Somerset 179-9 (van der Merwe 36, Leach 11) This has been a fine counter-attack from van der Merwe, who mows Harmer to cow corner for two more. I wonder if his approach will give the Essex batsmen ideas. It takes a certain chutzpah to go after the spinners on a bunsen when you only need a draw, but it\u2019s also asking for trouble to let Jack Leach and the rest settle into a rhythm with men round the bat. Later in the over, van der Merwe sweeps Harmer on the bounce to deep square leg, where Cook slips over in the Samit style. 54th over: Somerset 172-9 (van der Merwe 29, Leach 11) Thanks Tanya, hello everyone. Getting interesting, this. Jamie Porter returns in place of Samuel Cook and has a huge shout for LBW against turned down by Alex Wharf. That looked on the plumb side of close; three reds on Hawkeye confirm its eminent DRSability. 53rd over: Somerset 167-9 (Leach 9, van der Merwe 21) Van der Mere scythes Harmer straight over Leach\u2019s head for four. A couple more as Harmer, who holds the ball high in his fingers, almost as if he was displaying a porcelain egg, bowls on, and on. And that\u2019s it from me, I\u2019ll hand you over to Rob Smyth for the rest of the day - enjoy! 52nd over: Somerset 160-9 (Leach 9, van der Merwe 21) A couple of scampered singles, then van der Merwe hits a skyer just short of the fielder. And Somerset add another three to the total. Softly, softy, catchy monkey. 51st over: Somerset 157-9 (Leach 8, van der Merwe 19) A boundary from van der Merwe that I missed, and Essex should remember that Leach is very adept at eeking runs from tricky positions. 50th over: Somerset 152-9 (Leach 8, van der Merwe 14) A huge cheer for Headingley hero Jack Leach who gets off the mark straight away with a thick edge for four before driving Cook through third man for another boundary and adding half again to Cook\u2019s runs conceded tally in two balls. The cameras pan to a grey haired bloke in the crowd - blimey, that\u2019s John Cleese. Yesterday, another Conservative with experience of the courts, Jeffrey Archer, spent a rainy afternoon at Taunton. A sensational ball that nips in off the scrambled seam to destroy Bess\u2019s stumps. That\u2019s Cook\u2019s fourth wicket - for just 15. 49th over: Somerset 144-8 ( Bess 10, van der Merwe 14) Harmer again, in a No. 11 shirt, no vest. All proceeds as normal until Van der Merwe keeps his wrists low and reverse-sweep-dinks him over the fielder at deep backward point for six. 48th over: Somerset 138-8 ( Bess 10, van der Merwe 8) Van der Merwe is taking charge, Yes!, No! he shouts at his partner, but then Cook squares him up like a kipper, legs twisted. Just a single from the over. 47th over: Somerset 137-8 ( Bess 10, van der Merwe 7) And there we are, van der Merwe gets down on one knee and sweeps Harmer\u2019s first ball for six - what\u2019s the fuss about, he sniffs? Then he pancakes one, somewhat disdainfully, over his shoulder for a single. Bess is watchful. 46th over: Somerset 130-8 ( Bess 10, van der Merwe 0) Not that things are much easier from Sam Cook\u2019s end. A maiden. Somerset could really do with at least another 20 - from somewhere... 45th over: Somerset 130-8 ( Bess 10) Harmer resumes, sunglasses on, and immediately gets two lbws. Somerset need quick runs, preferably in the next over before they have to face Harmer again. The second wicket of Harmer\u2019s first over after lunch. Overton, hangdog, trots off. Ah, the replay shows it was a little high. Abell steps back and Harmer\u2019s delivery follows him, fixing him straight in front of the stumps. 44th over: Somerset 126-6 (Abell 45, Bess 10) Sam Cook, shirt untucked, mucky trouser legs, picks up the first over after lunch, his fifteenth over of the game. He\u2019s as accurate as ever but his fifth ball whizzes through low almost trimming the heads off the grass (if there was any). A maiden. And the players are out as we prepare to resume after lunch. Perhaps that was a well-timed break for grub after all as the covers are wheeled on at Taunton. Round the grounds, play has already been called off for the day at Edgbaston and there has been no play anywhere else except Chester-le-Street where.. Durham 262-8 (Watling 104; Hogan 4-35) v Glamorgan 43rd over: Somerset 126-6 (Abell 45, Bess 10) Abell survives a chance of sorts at short leg but the ball dipped very quickly in front of (Bopara)\u2018s hands. That is followed by a wristy drive with the back foot well in the crease that was simply edible. Then a couple more as the anoraks are pulled on in the crowd and the players skip off for lunch. 42nd over: Somerset 118-6 (Abell 41, Bess 9) Just a snappy single from Porter\u2019s over, and only a couple more to survive until that controversial lunch. 40th over: Somerset 117-6 (Abell 40, Bess 9) \u201cSkills Harmy,\u201d cries a fielder, but the sprinkling of rain that fell a few overs ago seems to have calmed the pitch a little, stroked it, pitch-whispered. Abell and Bess bat on. 39th over: Somerset 116-6 (Abell 39, Bess 9) Some very interesting talk from Mark Ramprakash and Ebony Rainford-Brent about the Lions and pressure on players to change once they fall on the ECB radar. They\u2019ve been watching Jamie Porter\u2019s run-up which, now I study it, does look rather laboured. But then I haven\u2019t seen enough of Porter to know if it was ever thus. 38th over: Somerset 114-6 (Abell 33, Bess 7) I\u2019ve not much to say about that Harmer over, a maiden, as I was reading this absolutely lovely email from Harry in Vietnam. Good Evening (Morning) Tanya, On many occasions the OBO has got me through some pretty long days. I work to rescue and rehabilitation of wildlife from the illegal trade in Vietnam. The job has many aspects, some extraordinarily slow. Socialising bears is one such event when they have no interest in socialising but, meander around dens apart while I keep watch just in case. In such times a cricket match taking place and 6 minute updates on the action are a ray of light in the otherwise furry boredom. Today I am not embarking on one of the slower jobs such as socialising bears, watching the behaviours of a hornbill or macaque, or post anesthesia monitoring a tiger but, answering your call for emails.. Not that this is a particularly interesting email mind. Then again, you asked for emails, not interesting ones. I\u2019ve not been back to England in years but, still a Somerset fan. All the best Harry - that\u2019s up there in my top ten OBO emails. Thank you. 37th over: Somerset 113-6 (Abell 33, Bess 7) Under his maroon helmet, Tom Abell is clean shaven - quite rare in a sportsman at the moment. [ I must admit I\u2019m a sucker for a bit of stubble] Anyway - that is a gorgeous drive by Abell as Cook stays a little, really classy, giving his bat face a great show. 36th over: Somerset 108-6 (Abell 33, Bess 7) Mark Ramprakash is on the mike, and is impressed with Dom Bess\u2019s footwork. Forward he goes, back he goes, and that is a very handy outside edge from Abell which flies past the right hand of the diving Cook at slip for four. Nine from Harmer\u2019s over as a shower passes slowly over the ground. 35th over: Somerset 99-6 (Abell 29, Bess 2) Sam Cook is poetry in motion. Non-demonstrative, he pitches the ball on a dime and beats the edge ball, after ball, after ball. A magnificent email arrives. As far as chocolate bars, I come to you with a single caveat - nothing puts me off more than a bar of solid chocolate. Your Dairy Milks, your Galaxys, your standard Yorkies - these are not appealing and border on the sickly. In terms of the autumnal bar of choice, I find myself shifting from the summery allure of a Crunchie - selected as even if the chocolate melts off the outside you have a solid central honeycomb to hold and consume - to something with a caramelly core. I\u2019m talking Lion Bars, Toffee Crisps, a Starbar, and, of course, the king of bars in the shape of a Tunnocks Caramel Wafer. As the winter draws in, I tend to find myself going for the more festive bars - often a Fry\u2019s Peppermint Cream or a Fudge - and of course the obligatory Roses/Quality Street box/tub over the festive period itself.. Spring brings with it a shift to something a little lighter, and I might go for a Bounty or Dime, potentially a KitKat. And then when summer comes I reach again for the Crunchie and the cycle repeats. Today, in rainy Leeds but watching rainy Taunton, I\u2019ve got a real urge for a Double Decker, though. Thanks again! Thank you Oliver - that is Willie Wonkerish in its detail. 34th over: Somerset 98-6 (Abell 29, Bess 1) Two off Harmer, more importantly they survive him. 150 would be a good effort from here. 33rd over: Somerset 96-6 (Abell 28, Bess 0) Dom Bess, whose nascent batting career is remembered by two innings - his 57 against Pakistan and his heave-ho against Lancashire in the Championship match here last year - watchfully plays out the remainder of Cook\u2019s over. I don\u2019t think Gregory will want to see a replay of that. He tottered forward so his leg was just in front of the stumps, and left the ball. Cook was laughing as he celebrated. 32nd over: Somerset 96-5 (Abell 28, Gregory 17) Now Rob Key has mentioned Harmer\u2019s big hands, I can\u2019t keep my eyes off them. They\u2019re huge. Hams - big fat Christmas ones. A single, an lbw shout and a possible chance grassed by Alastair Cook off the over. 32nd over: Somerset 95-5 (Abell 28, Gregory 16) The excellent Cook strays just a hand off his length and Abell flicks with some style - another boundary. Five dots follow. Gareth Wilson is also feeling the pain of the break for sandwiches, \u201cHi Tanya- cricket doesn\u2019t help itself, does it? Start play at noon then stop for lunch at 1? Seriously? Why not play till 2? It\u2019s so frustrating.....\u201d I don\u2019t know quite why they didn\u2019t take an early lunch. Trescothick special lasagne that will only be ready at one? 31st over: Somerset 91-5 (Abell 24, Gregory 16) Gregory uses his feet turns and swivel-pulls Harmer to the leg-side boundary. This has to be the way, surely? No one is gong to out-bat Harmer. What\u2019s this? He swings again, and gets an inside edge past the stumps, past the keeper for four more. And again! A precariously lucky edge that flies past Alastair Cook at slip. And then a fourth boundary, a textbook force off the back foot. Sixteen tasty runs off the over. 31st over: Somerset 75-5 (Abell 24, Gregory 0) A maiden from Sam Cook. It\u2019s breezy out there in the middle and I take back what I said earlier, there is some blue sky up to the left behind the church. 30th over: Somerset 75-5 (Abell 24, Gregory 0) Classic Harmer. Such a menacing force, he goes round the wicket to Gregory who scuttles forward and survives the over. A breakthrough in Harmer\u2019s first over of the day as Bartlett goes back and turns the ball straight into the mitts of Bopara. 29th over: Somerset 75-4 (Abell 24, Bartlett 5) Cook finishes off his over prorogued yesterday by rain - a snorter that skids past the outside of Abell\u2019s bat. Aha! We have some action at Taunton, the players are out, the sky is greyish, but Sam Cook is bowling in short sleeves. Thank you! My inbox over-floweth. And yes, the thing that has enraged you all is the good old English lunch-break. Mark Hooper growls, \u201cThe deciding match of the championship and they allow an hour\u2019s play before stopping for lunch! You\u2019d think that, just for once, they could just make do with a couple of satsumas and a protein shake? And then have a break when it rains again LIKE IT\u2019S GOING TO DO ALL WEEK!\u201d \u201cWhy do we still have these ridiculous meal breaks when a lot of time has already been lost,\u201d rages David Malcolm. \u201cCricket should be more flexible. There is more rain on the way, so why not get as much play as possible before it arrives. Bet it starts raining again as soon as they return from lunch. Common sense is sadly missing due to silly Victorian rules about eating at set times. The players obviously need breaks but the weather conditions should be taken into account.\u201d They\u2019re playing cricket at Chester-le-Street, where at least one person is nail nibbling. Durham 238-8 against promotion possibles Glamorgan, with BJ Watling 93 not out. Right, come on people, someone send me an email. That monkey on your back- the Cricketer\u2019s Power List, the best chocolate bars to see you through autumn, the young player to watch for 2020 - give it a nudge. Away from the Supreme Court to Taunton, where the umpires have decided that play will start at noon with lunch taken at one o\u2019clock. Rob Key is out on the pitch, which is dry as a bone - the drainage system has played a blinder . The players are on the outfield stretching, bending, chewing the fat. The groundsmen are digging forks into the boundary edge. So .... Boris Johnson\u2019s prorogation of Parliament was illegal... And through the precipitation pings an email: \u201cI failed yesterday to respond to your question, \u201cif you had to give the ECB 100 lines, what would the sentence be?\u201d writes Kim Thonger. I respond thus. They must write...\u201cI must say, a hundred times, no to the hundred.\u201d But just for fun, they must write it in Latin...\u201cFatendum est, iterumque centuplicet nec hundredo\u201d. (It\u2019s Google translate Latin (mine is rusty) so I\u2019m expecting John Cleese to appear as if by magic in the living room and hit me round the head and correct it, but frankly I don\u2019t care, so long as the ECB get the main thrust of the message which is, they\u2019re in a poorly designed canoe, up a creek shaped like a dog extrusion that rhymes with bird, barking up the wrong tree, at a pigeon that\u2019s long since flown the nest.) Ah, we now have a full house. The rain is falling at Chester-le-Street too. Still, some happy quotes from Dom Sibley who has more than deserved his chance to pull on the England cap this winter. \u201cThere have been a few articles written in the last few days and my friends and family have been saying \u2018oh, you\u2019re picked\u2019 but until you get that confirmation you can\u2019t think about it too much. So it\u2019s a thrill to have it confirmed and to be going away with England to New Zealand is really pleasing. We\u2019ll see how it goes out there and hopefully I will get a Test match. \u201cI have been pleased with my consistency. It has been down to a combination of a few things - a few changes technically and, to an extent, taking responsibility because we have had a few younger lads in the Warwickshire batting line-up. With batting it is just a case of getting in the groove and on a roll and I have done that. \u201cRory Burns has scored runs in championship cricket over the years and he got his chance so that showed what can happen. I made my Surrey second-team debut opening with Rory and made my first-team debut with him and he is a good mate so it will be great to be alongside him in the England squad.\u201d The television is now working, though with subtitles, and I\u2019ve turned on to find Dominic Cork talking about Simon Harmer\u2019s BIG HANDS. The rain has stopped at Taunton so, while we wait, here are some Marcus Trescothick magic memories. Ah. Thanks for the tip below the line - it is also raining in Canterbury and the start is delayed at Hove, Lord\u2019s and Grace Road - where the club describe the prospects of play today as \u201cbleak.\u201d But play will start on time at The Riverside! A glass raised to more autumn cricket north of Hartlepool. Now please excuse me briefly while I try and get the telly to work. If you missed the tour squads yesterday, (and rather exciting they were too) here is Ali\u2019s take on them - omission of YJB and all. Elsewhere the news is ... damp. There will be no play before lunch at The Oval or Edgbaston, and things are also delayed at the crucial Division Two promotion bash at Bristol, with Gloucestershire perched uncomfortably in the dressing-room at 80 for 6. Good morning from heavy-sponged Manchester - and a soggy looking Taunton, where the super sopper is out and mopping furiously. The Met Office site shows signs of hope - clear weather between 10 and 2 - if the groundsmen can dry the outfield in time to get the players out before the next fat plopping rain clouds return. The umpires are due to peer again at the pitch at 11am. Yesterday\u2019s match stopped just before lunch with Somerset 75-4 on a dustbowl against the wiles of Simon Harmer and Sam Cook. It was tricky out there. As James Hildreth: said, \u201cI think anything above 200 will be a good score. Every run out there seems massive\u201d",

For example, in a time of anti-sanctions and antiwar activism in relation to Iraq in the 1990s, Cynthia and the wider Women in Black (WiB) network in London were among the few British-based activists who pointed not only to the terrible effects of economic sanctions on Iraqi society, particularly on women, but also to the effects of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/dec/30/iraq.guardianobituaries\" title=\"\">Saddam Hussein</a>\u2019s atrocities.</p> <p>Cynthia\u2019s feminist peace activism started at the Greenham Common women\u2019s peace camp, which she visited between 1981 and 2000. In 1993, she was key to establishing WiB in London and was instrumental in sustaining it over decades as an organiser and participant in weekly vigils at the statue of Edith Cavell in Trafalgar Square. The political choir <a href=\"https://www.raised-voices.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Raised Voices</a> was another important part of Cynthia\u2019s local political engagement. As well as singing in the choir, she wrote the lyrics to several of the songs that have made up its repertoire.</p> <p>She was also closely connected to international peace activism through the <a href=\"https://www.wilpf.org/\" title=\"\">Women\u2019s International League for Peace and Freedom</a> (WILPF) and the global network of WiB, and had recently started to write a history of WiB.</p> <p>Born in Leicester, Cynthia was the daughter of Constance (nee King), a milliner\u2019s assistant before her marriage, and Shirley Ellis, a sewing thread manufacturer. On leaving Malvern girls\u2019 college (now Malvern St James school), where she was a boarder, Cynthia found work as a typist at the Home Office and moved in 1953 to London, a city that, she often stressed, changed her life.</p> <p>Her last published book, Looking to London: Stories of War, Migration and Asylum (2017) was a tribute to the city she loved. It tells the story of female refugees who have sought a haven among the capital\u2019s Kurdish, Somali, Tamil, Sudanese and Syrian communities.</p> <p>Her early research interests ranged from local governance to the sexual division of labour. Her publications from this period included The Local State: Management of Cities and People (1977); Machinery of Dominance: Women, Men and Technical Know-How (1990); Brothers: Male Dominance and Technological Change (1991); In the Way of Women: Men\u2019s Resistance to Sex Equality in Organizations (1991) and Gender and Technology in the Making (1993).</p> <p>Cynthia\u2019s joint work with Susan Omrod on the microwave oven, for example, contributed to the development of the field of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/feb/23/truth-world-built-for-men-car-crashes\" title=\"\">gender and technology studies</a>. <a href=\"https://timeline.com/brown-goods-white-goods-microwave-bdbca3e93cc9\" title=\"\">Designed by men and marketed initially as a state-of-the-art technology for men without wives</a>, the microwave attracted little interest when placed in the \u201cbrown goods\u201d \u2013 TVs and hi-fis \u2013 leisure sections of shops, aimed at men.

Increasingly, photography had become an important aspect of her work, and her own pictures appear in all her recent books.</p> <p>By sheer coincidence, I ended up renting a room in Cynthia\u2019s house in Kentish Town, north London, in 1994 when starting a PhD on the Egyptian women\u2019s rights movement at SOAS. Her home, buzzing with a constant flow of visitors from across the globe, was also a venue for organising local vigils and protests. Yet what impressed and inspired me most over the years, as we became close friends, was her profound commitment to social justice and her desire to put her feminist theory and politics into everyday practice.</p> <p>She did much of the house maintenance herself and was good at carpentry; she built a pigeon loft on the roof. Cynthia loved nature and bird watching and knew more than 100 birds by song.</p> <p>When she learned that her cancer was no longer treatable, she sought an assisted death at Dignitas in Switzerland.</p> <p>She cared deeply about those around her, whether her many friends, or her family. In 1959 she married Charles Cockburn, an architect, and, even after they separated in the 70s and later divorced, they maintained a close friendship. </p> <p>Cynthia is survived by their daughters, Claudia and Jess, and her granddaughters, Elsa Maria, Josie and Deniel.</p> <p>\u2022 Cynthia Kay Cockburn, sociologist and peace activist, born 24 July 1934; died 12 September 2019</p>",

As well as singing in the choir, she wrote the lyrics to several of the songs that have made up its repertoire. She was also closely connected to international peace activism through the Women\u2019s International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF) and the global network of WiB, and had recently started to write a history of WiB. Born in Leicester, Cynthia was the daughter of Constance (nee King), a milliner\u2019s assistant before her marriage, and Shirley Ellis, a sewing thread manufacturer. On leaving Malvern girls\u2019 college (now Malvern St James school), where she was a boarder, Cynthia found work as a typist at the Home Office and moved in 1953 to London, a city that, she often stressed, changed her life. Her last published book, Looking to London: Stories of War, Migration and Asylum (2017) was a tribute to the city she loved. It tells the story of female refugees who have sought a haven among the capital\u2019s Kurdish, Somali, Tamil, Sudanese and Syrian communities. Her early research interests ranged from local governance to the sexual division of labour. Her publications from this period included The Local State: Management of Cities and People (1977); Machinery of Dominance: Women, Men and Technical Know-How (1990); Brothers: Male Dominance and Technological Change (1991); In the Way of Women: Men\u2019s Resistance to Sex Equality in Organizations (1991) and Gender and Technology in the Making (1993). Cynthia\u2019s joint work with Susan Omrod on the microwave oven, for example, contributed to the development of the field of gender and technology studies. Designed by men and marketed initially as a state-of-the-art technology for men without wives, the microwave attracted little interest when placed in the \u201cbrown goods\u201d \u2013 TVs and hi-fis \u2013 leisure sections of shops, aimed at men. It flourished only once moved to the \u201cwhite goods\u201d \u2013 washing machines, ovens and fridges \u2013 catering for what were seen as women\u2019s needs. Despite never having attended university herself, Cynthia held several honorary degrees, including an honorary doctorate from the University of Lund (Sweden), a visiting chair in the Department of Sociology at City University London, and an honorary chair at the Centre for the Study of Women and Gender at the University of Warwick. She contributed to the Guardian, Red Pepper, Feminist Review, Open Democracy and Peace News. Increasingly, photography had become an important aspect of her work, and her own pictures appear in all her recent books. By sheer coincidence, I ended up renting a room in Cynthia\u2019s house in Kentish Town, north London, in 1994 when starting a PhD on the Egyptian women\u2019s rights movement at SOAS. Her home, buzzing with a constant flow of visitors from across the globe, was also a venue for organising local vigils and protests. Yet what impressed and inspired me most over the years, as we became close friends, was her profound commitment to social justice and her desire to put her feminist theory and politics into everyday practice. She did much of the house maintenance herself and was good at carpentry; she built a pigeon loft on the roof. Cynthia loved nature and bird watching and knew more than 100 birds by song. When she learned that her cancer was no longer treatable, she sought an assisted death at Dignitas in Switzerland. She cared deeply about those around her, whether her many friends, or her family. In 1959 she married Charles Cockburn, an architect, and, even after they separated in the 70s and later divorced, they maintained a close friendship. Cynthia is survived by their daughters, Claudia and Jess, and her granddaughters, Elsa Maria, Josie and Deniel. \u2022 Cynthia Kay Cockburn, sociologist and peace activist, born 24 July 1934; died 12 September 2019",

The Paris prosecutor\u2019s office confirmed that investigators had carried out searches at Brunel\u2019s Karin Models in the 8th arrondissement of Paris and at Epstein\u2019s luxury 800 sq metre apartment on the exclusive Avenue Foch near the Arc de Triomphe. Police sources told local media the search of the late US financier\u2019s residence, part of a French probe into allegations that he and others had for years trafficked underage girls for sex, began at 3pm on Monday and continued until 4am on Tuesday. Epstein\u2019s Franco-Brazilian butler told the Franceinfo news site that the apartment contained a specially built massage room to which \u201ca great many women\u201d had come. He added that he was not able to judge whether any of them were minors. Epstein was arrested on 6 July in New Jersey after returning in his private jet from Paris.

But that makes it sound like some dreadful, unseemly rumble in which a lot of right-handers were thrown, when in actuality it was a most refined affair. You see, there was a lot of backslapping going on. An awful lot. Close your eyes, and you could be forgiven for assuming the ghosts of Buddy Rich, Jaki Liebezeit and Keith Moon had turned up to record a cover version of Antmusic. Or that a load of pundits, presenters and journalists had just logged on to Social Media Disgrace Twitter for their nightly org1astic conflab. Ow! Give it a rest, will you, The Fiver\u2019s developing tinnitus over here. But no. It was actual backslapping, good old hearty hard backslapping, at a Fifa awards ceremony that has nothing to do with the Ballon d\u2019Or, or maybe it once did, we can\u2019t keep up to tell the truth.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/24/megan-rapinoe-the-worlds-best-player-in-every-sense-of-the-word\">Megan Rapinoe: the world's best player in every sense of the word</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the room, the judges come and go, talking of Megan Rapinoe. And so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/24/megan-rapinoe-the-worlds-best-player-in-every-sense-of-the-word\">she won women\u2019s player of the year</a>, fair enough given her sterling efforts in France. J\u00fcrgen Klopp landing the men\u2019s manager of the year award wasn\u2019t too outrageous a decision either, plus it gave him opportunity to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/24/jurgen-klopp-joins-common-goal\">road-test some new material</a> for his next Netflix special. (Still very much a work in progress, if the number of pins we heard drop after each carefully honed zinger is anything to go by.) But Lionel Messi <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/23/lionel-messi-virgil-van-dijk-the-best-fifa-awards\">winning men\u2019s player of the year</a>? Come off it and come on! All he did was score 51 goals, most of them in the poor man\u2019s Scottish Premiership, and disappear in a sulk upon getting clipped round the lug by Andy Robertson. No wonder Cristiano Ronaldo stayed at home with his trotters up.</p> <p>Elsewhere, the gong for women\u2019s goalkeeper of the year was handed to Alisson, at least for a while on the Fifa website, until somebody bothered to double-check it. This sort of thing would never happen to Adri\u00e1n. But there was finally some good news for long-suffering Nasty Leeds, who have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/23/leeds-united-marcelo-bielsa-win-fifa-fair-play-award-aston-villa-equaliser\">officially rebranded by Fifa</a> as reward for Marcelo Bielsa ordering his team to let in an equaliser against Aston Villa because Plain Old John Terry was about to throw a red-faced tantrum and it wasn\u2019t worth the tear-up. Only time will tell if Hello Sun Hello Sky Hello Trees Let\u2019s Skip And Sing And Dance And Play! Leeds catches on.</p> <p>It\u2019s not going to catch on, is it. Because let\u2019s face it, these sort of awards don\u2019t really mean much. Michael Owen was European player of the year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2001/dec/18/newsstory.sport3\">in 2001</a>, for goodness sake. See, if it was up to us, we\u2019d have given the men\u2019s award to Alfredo Morelos, the top scorer in the <em>actual</em> Scottish Premiership. As we\u2019re pretty sure you\u2019ll agree, his 18 goals are worth nearly three times the ones handed on a plate in Spain to Messi. Plus he\u2019s a whole lot of hot-headed fun. Much more entertaining. We like him.

It was actual backslapping, good old hearty hard backslapping, at a Fifa awards ceremony that has nothing to do with the Ballon d\u2019Or, or maybe it once did, we can\u2019t keep up to tell the truth. In the room, the judges come and go, talking of Megan Rapinoe. And so she won women\u2019s player of the year, fair enough given her sterling efforts in France. J\u00fcrgen Klopp landing the men\u2019s manager of the year award wasn\u2019t too outrageous a decision either, plus it gave him opportunity to road-test some new material for his next Netflix special. (Still very much a work in progress, if the number of pins we heard drop after each carefully honed zinger is anything to go by.) But Lionel Messi winning men\u2019s player of the year? Come off it and come on! All he did was score 51 goals, most of them in the poor man\u2019s Scottish Premiership, and disappear in a sulk upon getting clipped round the lug by Andy Robertson. No wonder Cristiano Ronaldo stayed at home with his trotters up. Elsewhere, the gong for women\u2019s goalkeeper of the year was handed to Alisson, at least for a while on the Fifa website, until somebody bothered to double-check it. This sort of thing would never happen to Adri\u00e1n. But there was finally some good news for long-suffering Nasty Leeds, who have been officially rebranded by Fifa as reward for Marcelo Bielsa ordering his team to let in an equaliser against Aston Villa because Plain Old John Terry was about to throw a red-faced tantrum and it wasn\u2019t worth the tear-up. Only time will tell if Hello Sun Hello Sky Hello Trees Let\u2019s Skip And Sing And Dance And Play! Leeds catches on. It\u2019s not going to catch on, is it. Because let\u2019s face it, these sort of awards don\u2019t really mean much. Michael Owen was European player of the year in 2001, for goodness sake. See, if it was up to us, we\u2019d have given the men\u2019s award to Alfredo Morelos, the top scorer in the actual Scottish Premiership. As we\u2019re pretty sure you\u2019ll agree, his 18 goals are worth nearly three times the ones handed on a plate in Spain to Messi. Plus he\u2019s a whole lot of hot-headed fun. Much more entertaining. We like him. He\u2019s the Best. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE! Join Scott Murray from 7.45pm for hot MBM coverage of Portsmouth 1-2 Southampton and more in our Coca-Cola Cup clockwatch. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cThey\u2019re a frightening prospect. I\u2019ve watched the highlights and it was 8-0 going on 15 or 16-0 \u2013 it\u2019s like a hurricane coming at you. We wanted one of the best, we\u2019ve got our wish and I hope I don\u2019t regret it\u201d \u2013 Preston boss Alex Neil pulls down the Deepdale storm shutters in anticipation of Manchester City\u2019s potentially nasty visit in the Milk Cup. RECOMMENDED LOOKING It\u2019s David Squires! FIVER LETTERS \u201cRe: Nick Kershaw (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters). Wouldn\u2019t It Be Good if we could all win a prize (or not) by recycling Viz jokes from about 20 years ago? The evidence here\u201d \u2013 Tim Woods (and 1,056 others). \u201cWell done to Manchester United for considering a standing section for their fans (yesterday\u2019s News, Bits and Bobs). That will undoubtedly make it easier for fans to safely exit the stadium, particularly between the 60th and 75th minutes of most dire home matches\u201d \u2013 Mike Wilner. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport. Today\u2019s winner of our prizeless letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 Mike Wilner. BITS AND BOBS Manchester United might be bobbins on the field, but \u2026 wait, get the open-top bus parade booked: they\u2019ve won the Revenue Cup again, crunching \u00a3627.1m through Old Trafford\u2019s coffers in the last financial year. Ed Woodward would still prefer a shiny pot, mind. \u201cEveryone at Manchester United is committed to delivering on our primary objective of winning trophies,\u201d he cheered, as Phil Jones guffawed behind him. England boss Phil Neville has recalled midfielder Jordan Nobbs for upcoming friendlies against Brazil and Portugal after she recovered from long-term knee-knack. Full squad: Millie Bright (Chelsea), Lucy Bronze (Lyon), Rachel Daly (Houston Dash), Mary Earps (Manchester United), Beth England (Chelsea), Alex Greenwood (Lyon), Morris Dancing Fiver (Fiver Towers) [younger sibling, similar habits \u2013 Fiver Ed], Steph Houghton (Manchester City), Fran Kirby (Chelsea), Aoife Mannion (Manchester City), Abbie McManus (Manchester United), Beth Mead (Arsenal), Jordan Nobbs (Arsenal), Nikita Parris (Lyon), Ellie Roebuck (Manchester City), Jill Scott (Manchester City), Demi Stokes (Manchester City), Jodie Taylor (Reign FC), Carly Telford (Chelsea), Keira Walsh (Manchester City), Leah Williamson (Arsenal). Hampshire fuzz have put a dispersal order in place which allows them to ask anyone they don\u2019t like the look of to leave Southampton or Portsmouth for 48 hours as they prepare for potential bother before Pompey v Saints in the Fizzy Cup. Liverpool look to be heading to court for a battle with current kit supplier New Balance after reports emerged linking the Big Cup champions with a switch to Nike. \u201cWe can confirm that our kit supplier, New Balance, has commenced a legal dispute against the club. We will not be making any further comment during these legal proceedings,\u201d tooted a Liverpool suit. And Ian McCall loves Partick Thistle so much that he\u2019s left second-placed Scottish Championship side Ayr United to take the reins at the rock-bottom Jags. \u201cThere is a real emotional pull here,\u201d he quivered, wiping away a hot salty tear. RECOMMENDED LISTENING It\u2019s Football Weekly! RECOMMENDED LOOKING It\u2019s a lively start to this game! STILL WANT MORE? \u201cYou could feel the hatred.\u201d Ben Fisher chats to veterans of the spicy old Pompey-Saints rivalry, the latest instalment of which comes in the Rumbelows Cup.

      "body": "<p>Donald Trump has a problem with elections. Seemingly lacking confidence in his ability to win them through honest and untreasonable means, he has repeatedly questioned the integrity of the American electoral system while seeking the help of foreign powers to tip the balance in his favor. From suggesting he might not accept the results of an election based on the lie that \u201cmillions of illegals\u201d are able to cast votes to openly welcoming the help of Russia in 2016, Trump has made it clear that he cannot be trusted to oversee the presidential election of 2020.</p> <p>Sadly, in the months following the fizzle which marked the end of the Mueller investigation, this basic truth has slipped out of focus. A coalition of Republicans for whom Trump can do no wrong, Democratic lawmakers worried about the politics of impeachment and progressive commentators who claim that holding Trump accountable for his conduct is a distraction from the pocketbook issues which most concern voters has come together to urge the nation to move on.</p> <p>Donald Trump, meanwhile, has not moved on. We now know that just a day after Mueller\u2019s testimony to Congress in July, Trump was once again attempting to work with a foreign power to influence a US election.</p> <p>In a phone call on 25 July, Trump pressured the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to come up with dirt on the business activities in Ukraine of Hunter Biden, the son of the leading candidate for the Democratic nomination, Joe Biden. Shortly beforehand, Trump had suspended $400m in US military aid for Ukraine, presenting the new Ukrainian president with an apparent choice: come up with some incriminating information on Hunter, or lose aid desperately needed to defend against the Russian invasion of eastern Ukraine.</p> <p>If these facts \u2013 which are based on reporting and the apparent contents of a whistleblower complaint filed against the administration \u2013 are correct, they are a clear example of the kind of \u201chigh crime and misdemeanor\u201d for which impeachment is the intended remedy. Even if Trump did not explicitly offer Zelenskiy a quid pro quo, his attempt to enlist Ukrainian help against his chief political rival is a blatant perversion of Trump\u2019s constitutional duty to uphold the common good rather than using the powers of office to seek his own narrow self-interest. Indeed, curbing the influence of foreign countries over American politics was one of the chief concerns of the founders when they wrote the constitution.</p> <p>Beyond the specific facts of this scandal, there is a broader truth which now points inescapably towards impeachment: Donald Trump is not a man who can be trusted to oversee the continued functioning of American democracy.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If the Ukraine scandal is allowed to melt into the ether in much the way the Russian scandal has done, there is no telling where Trump might stop in his attempts to tip the scales in 2020</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Opponents of impeaching the president often point out that voters will have a chance to toss Trump out of office in 2020, and it is better to wait for this remedy rather than reaching straight for impeachment. But this is a weak argument indeed when Trump\u2019s actions target the very ability of voters to exercise their rights in free and fair elections. Congress would not be pre-empting the voice of voters but defending their ability to be heard in the first place.</p> <p>Congress must also be mindful of precedent. If the Ukraine scandal is allowed to melt into the ether in much the way the Russian scandal has done, there is no telling where Trump might stop in his attempts to tip the scales in 2020. And there is even less telling how far a future president \u2013 perhaps one more rational and competent than Trump \u2013 might go in undermining American democracy if the precedent is established that there is no penalty for doing so.</p> <p>No one should be so naive as to believe that an impeachment push by Democrats in the House of Representatives, where Democrats hold a majority, is likely to end in Trump\u2019s conviction by the US Senate, where they are a minority. Republican senators are not likely to convict Trump absent some large shift in conservative grassroots opinion, and the rightwing media echo chamber makes such a shift almost inconceivable. But it is just as inconceivable that Democrats should be expected to simply go along with Republican members of Congress as they shirk their own constitutional duty to oversee the conduct of the president.</p> <p>But nor will impeachment necessarily be good for the president and bad for Democrats, as many commentators seem to assume. Perhaps some voters will think Democrats are wasting their time investigating Trump\u2019s attempts to undermine American democracy, but this view seems to give voters little credit. It is clear from his approval ratings, which are abysmally low despite a strong economy, that Trump suffers from the fog of corruption and malfeasance which surrounds his administration. Impeachment investigations will make clear quite how thick this fog is, and provide a ready framework in which to fit each new outrage that Trump will inevitably commit between now and November 2020.</p> <p>Politics aside, the broader truth is that American democracy is in such peril that a defense of its principles is now much more important than any short-term political calculation. Donald Trump has made it clear that these principles mean nothing to him, and the constitutional remedy is clear. Responsible members of Congress must act. If not now, as the very integrity of American democracy is threatened by an executive which considers itself not bound by law, then when?</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Andrew Gawthorpe is a lecturer in history and international studies at Leiden University in </em><em>the Netherlands</em></p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has a problem with elections. Seemingly lacking confidence in his ability to win them through honest and untreasonable means, he has repeatedly questioned the integrity of the American electoral system while seeking the help of foreign powers to tip the balance in his favor. From suggesting he might not accept the results of an election based on the lie that \u201cmillions of illegals\u201d are able to cast votes to openly welcoming the help of Russia in 2016, Trump has made it clear that he cannot be trusted to oversee the presidential election of 2020. Sadly, in the months following the fizzle which marked the end of the Mueller investigation, this basic truth has slipped out of focus. A coalition of Republicans for whom Trump can do no wrong, Democratic lawmakers worried about the politics of impeachment and progressive commentators who claim that holding Trump accountable for his conduct is a distraction from the pocketbook issues which most concern voters has come together to urge the nation to move on. Donald Trump, meanwhile, has not moved on. We now know that just a day after Mueller\u2019s testimony to Congress in July, Trump was once again attempting to work with a foreign power to influence a US election. In a phone call on 25 July, Trump pressured the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to come up with dirt on the business activities in Ukraine of Hunter Biden, the son of the leading candidate for the Democratic nomination, Joe Biden. Shortly beforehand, Trump had suspended $400m in US military aid for Ukraine, presenting the new Ukrainian president with an apparent choice: come up with some incriminating information on Hunter, or lose aid desperately needed to defend against the Russian invasion of eastern Ukraine. If these facts \u2013 which are based on reporting and the apparent contents of a whistleblower complaint filed against the administration \u2013 are correct, they are a clear example of the kind of \u201chigh crime and misdemeanor\u201d for which impeachment is the intended remedy. Even if Trump did not explicitly offer Zelenskiy a quid pro quo, his attempt to enlist Ukrainian help against his chief political rival is a blatant perversion of Trump\u2019s constitutional duty to uphold the common good rather than using the powers of office to seek his own narrow self-interest. Indeed, curbing the influence of foreign countries over American politics was one of the chief concerns of the founders when they wrote the constitution. Beyond the specific facts of this scandal, there is a broader truth which now points inescapably towards impeachment: Donald Trump is not a man who can be trusted to oversee the continued functioning of American democracy. Opponents of impeaching the president often point out that voters will have a chance to toss Trump out of office in 2020, and it is better to wait for this remedy rather than reaching straight for impeachment. But this is a weak argument indeed when Trump\u2019s actions target the very ability of voters to exercise their rights in free and fair elections. Congress would not be pre-empting the voice of voters but defending their ability to be heard in the first place. Congress must also be mindful of precedent. If the Ukraine scandal is allowed to melt into the ether in much the way the Russian scandal has done, there is no telling where Trump might stop in his attempts to tip the scales in 2020. And there is even less telling how far a future president \u2013 perhaps one more rational and competent than Trump \u2013 might go in undermining American democracy if the precedent is established that there is no penalty for doing so. No one should be so naive as to believe that an impeachment push by Democrats in the House of Representatives, where Democrats hold a majority, is likely to end in Trump\u2019s conviction by the US Senate, where they are a minority. Republican senators are not likely to convict Trump absent some large shift in conservative grassroots opinion, and the rightwing media echo chamber makes such a shift almost inconceivable. But it is just as inconceivable that Democrats should be expected to simply go along with Republican members of Congress as they shirk their own constitutional duty to oversee the conduct of the president. But nor will impeachment necessarily be good for the president and bad for Democrats, as many commentators seem to assume. Perhaps some voters will think Democrats are wasting their time investigating Trump\u2019s attempts to undermine American democracy, but this view seems to give voters little credit. It is clear from his approval ratings, which are abysmally low despite a strong economy, that Trump suffers from the fog of corruption and malfeasance which surrounds his administration. Impeachment investigations will make clear quite how thick this fog is, and provide a ready framework in which to fit each new outrage that Trump will inevitably commit between now and November 2020. Politics aside, the broader truth is that American democracy is in such peril that a defense of its principles is now much more important than any short-term political calculation. Donald Trump has made it clear that these principles mean nothing to him, and the constitutional remedy is clear. Responsible members of Congress must act. If not now, as the very integrity of American democracy is threatened by an executive which considers itself not bound by law, then when?

A blue bond is a debt instrument issued by governments, development banks or others to raise capital to finance marine- and ocean-based projects that have positive environmental, economic and climate benefits. The Seychelles last year launched the world\u2019s first sovereign blue bond, a $15m 10-year bond to protect marine environments and safeguard fisheries. Dr Peter Nuttall, a scientific and technical adviser for the Micronesian Center for Sustainable Transport at the University of the South Pacific, told the Guardian that shipping was the \u201cabsolute lifeline\u201d of any Pacific community. \u201cWithout shipping, our economies die, our people can\u2019t survive.

Nuttall said the Pacific \u201ccannot wait for the rest of the world. We have to bespoke design a Pacific solution if it is going to work, not leave the Pacific to languish. \u201cWe\u2019re running the biggest risk. The Pacific did nothing to cause climate change, but we\u2019re about to get smashed by it. What is it we can practically do to make people\u2019s lives better now? We know the answers, and we don\u2019t have time to wait.\u201d",

The employers\u2019 organisation said order books were shrinking and output was set to fall in the coming months amid Brexit uncertainty and global trade tensions. Growth in the first three months of 2019 was boosted by industry building up stocks of goods ahead of the original 29 March date set for the UK\u2019s departure from the European Union. But the latest snapshot of manufacturing from the CBI found no signs of a repeat in the run-up to the new deadline of 31 October. The survey of 269 firms conducted in late August and earlySeptember found that 13% of manufacturers said total order books were above normal, and 41% said they were below normal. The balance of -28 points compared with -13% the previous month. Only 6% of firms said their export order books were above normal, while 37% said they were below normal.

The mere fact that Twiston-Davies has him ready to go in September this time bodes well.</p> \n<p>He needs this to become a thorough test of stamina but there\u2019s enough runners to ensure Dr Robin doesn\u2019t have an easy time up front. Ballymalin is attracting interest at 5-1, down from the opening 7s.</p> \n<p>Earlier, <strong>Wenceslaus (2.45)</strong> goes straight into a handicap for his chasing debut and the 8-1 is tempting. David Bridgwater has been talking about chasing for a year with this one, who scored twice over the smaller obstacles last autumn without being very fluent at his hurdles.</p> \n<p>At Beverley, <strong>Hackle Setter (4.10)</strong> is 9-1 in a race cutting up because of the softening ground.

They are only about whether the advice given by the prime minister to Her Majesty the Queen on 27 or 28 August, that parliament should be prorogued from a date between 9 and 12 September until 14 October, was lawful and the legal consequences if it was not.\u201d</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>That the court had the right to act</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u201cThe first question is whether the lawfulness of the prime minister\u2019s advice to Her Majesty is justiciable. This court holds that it is. The courts have exercised a supervisory jurisdiction over the lawfulness of acts of the government for centuries.\u201c</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>That the prorogation was not \u2018normal\u2019</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u201cIt prevented parliament from carrying out its constitutional role for five out of the possible eight weeks between the end of the summer recess and exit day on 31 October. Proroguing parliament is quite different from parliament going into recess. While parliament is prorogued, neither house can meet, debate or pass legislation. Neither house can debate government policy. Nor may members ask written or oral questions of ministers or meet and take evidence in committees\u2026This prolonged suspension of parliamentary democracy took place in quite exceptional circumstances: the fundamental change which was due to take place in the constitution of the United Kingdom on 31 October. Parliament, and in particular the House of Commons as the elected representatives of the people, has a right to a voice in how that change comes about. The effect upon the fundamentals of our democracy was extreme.\u201d</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>That Boris Johnson\u2019s advice to the Queen was unlawful</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u201cThe court is bound to conclude, therefore, that the decision to advise Her Majesty to prorogue parliament was unlawful because it had the effect of frustrating or preventing the ability of parliament to carry out its constitutional functions without reasonable justification.\u201c</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>That parliament has not been prorogued</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u201cThis court has already concluded that the prime minister\u2019s advice to Her Majesty was unlawful, void and of no effect. This means that the order in council to which it led was also unlawful, void and of no effect and should be quashed. This means that when the royal commissioners walked into the House of Lords it was as if they walked in with a blank sheet of paper. The prorogation was also void and of no effect. Parliament has not been prorogued. This is the unanimous judgment of all 11 Justices.\u201d</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What happens next?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u201cIt is for parliament, and in particular the Speaker and the Lord Speaker, to decide what to do next. Unless there is some parliamentary rule of which we are unaware, they can take immediate steps to enable each house to meet as soon as possible. It is not clear to us that any step is needed from the prime minister, but if it is, the court is pleased that his counsel have told the court that he will take all necessary steps to comply with the terms of any declaration made by this court.\u201d</p>\n    <p><i>The <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2019-0192-judgment.pdf\">full judgment</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2019-0192-summary.pdf\">summary judgment</a> can be downloaded from the Supreme court website.</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><br>\u201cThis means that when the royal commissioners walked into the House of Lords [to prorogue parliament] it was as if they walked in with a blank sheet of paper.

The unanimous judgment from 11 justices on the UK\u2019s highest court followed an emergency three-day hearing last week that exposed fundamental legal differences over interpreting the country\u2019s unwritten constitution. The momentous decision was read out by Lady Hale, president of the supreme court. Unusually, none of the parties were provided with advance copies of the judgment due to its sensitivity. Only seven of the 11 justices who heard the case were present in court.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s amazing what you can find in an old French house! A painting attributed to Cimabue, the 13th-century genius who started the Renaissance, has turned up in Compi\u00e8gne, where its elderly owner hung it for years above a hotplate between her kitchen and lounge. This is the second such discovery of a lost masterpiece by a golden name of western art in France in the last few years. In 2014, a painting of Judith and Holofernes turned up in an attic in Toulouse and was sensationally attributed to Caravaggio. This summer it was sold in a private deal. And wait \u2013 the same expert who has authenticated this domestic discovery and is selling it together with Senlis auction house Acteon is also the man who defied doubters to successfully promote the Toulouse Caravaggio. Clearly, Eric Turquin has got a very good eye for world-class treasures hidden in plain sight in sleepy French homes. Or has he got a breathless tendency to over-enthuse about \u201cdiscoveries\u201d that may be more complex than they seem? This has all the hallmarks of the marketing campaign that made the \u201cCaravaggio in the attic\u201d such a hit. The magic of finding a masterpiece in (or close to) a kitchen is an irresistible story. So irresistible it makes sceptics sound like spoilsports. We do not need to question Turquin\u2019s good faith. But we do need to stand back and recognise the astonishing nature of the claim being made. If this is truly a Cimabue, it is a rare surviving work by the painter credited by Giorgio Vasari in his 1550 book The Lives of the Artists with liberating Italian art from starchy Byzantine formality by making human figures more alive and objects more three-dimensional. Those traits do appear in his \u201cnew\u201d painting The Mocking of Christ: a crowd of impassioned people surround Jesus in front of two buildings that are shown in depth and shaded. Not much, but a beginning \u2013 the start of the discovery of real-life in art that would lead to Leonardo da Vinci. Yet any unsigned painting found in a kitchen corridor surely needs lengthy appraisal by many different experts. What\u2019s worrying is the way this painting, like the Caravaggio from the loft, is being boldly called a Cimabue without wider discussion. This is the new norm at the profitable end of the Old Masters market. Great stories about unlikely discoveries sweep all before them, but art experts have recently been fooled by proven fakes.

      "bodyText": "The speaker, John Bercow, has said the House of Commons will reconvene from Wednesday morning, as opposition parties called on Boris Johnson to resign for unlawfully asking the Queen to prorogue parliament. In a statement on College Green in Westminster, Bercow said the Commons would sit from 11.30am on Wednesday following the judgment that the suspension of parliament was unlawful. He said there would be no prime minister\u2019s questions on that day but there would be scope for urgent questions, ministerial statements and emergency debate applications that could hold Johnson to account. The prime minister was in New York at the UN general assembly when the ruling was made but he later gave an interview to the BBC saying he strongly disagreed with the supreme court judgment and claiming his attempts to carry out Brexit had been \u201cnot made much easier by this kind of stuff in parliament or in the courts\u201d. He said he would respect the law but went on to hint at the possibility of another prorogation to allow a Queen\u2019s speech. \u201cI don\u2019t think the justices remotely excluded the possibility of having a Queen\u2019s speech but what we will certainly do is ensure parliament has plenty of time to debate Brexit,\u201d he said. Corbyn, who brought forward his Labour conference speech by 24 hours to Tuesday afternoon in order to return to parliament on Wednesday, led calls for the prime minister to consider his position. \u201cIt demonstrates a contempt for democracy and an abuse of power by him,\u201d he told conference delegates in Brighton. \u201cI will be in touch immediately to demand that parliament is recalled so that we can question the prime minister, demand that he obeys the law that has been passed by parliament, and recognise that our parliament is elected by our people to hold our government to account. \u201cI invite Boris Johnson, in the historic words, to consider his position and become the shortest-serving prime minister there\u2019s ever been.\u201d Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, said Johnson should resign and called for a no-confidence vote in his leadership if he refuses to do so. She told Sky News: \u201cIf the rules of democracy are to mean anything then I think a prime minister with any honour would tender his resignation today \u2026 If the prime minister isn\u2019t prepared to do the decent and honourable thing then I think parliament should quickly come together to force this prime minister from office.\u201d Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, said: \u201cThis confirms what we already knew \u2013 Boris Johnson isn\u2019t fit to be prime minister. He\u2019s misled Queen and country, and unlawfully silenced the people\u2019s representatives. I\u2019m on my way to resume my duties in the Commons and stop Brexit altogether.\u201d Condemnation also came from Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, who stopped short of calling for Johnson to resign but urged the prime minister to sack Dominic Cummings, his most senior aide who is thought to have been behind the prorogation plan. \u201cThe calling of a Queen\u2019s speech and prorogation is the worst political decision ever. Dominic Cummings must go,\u201d he said. In New York, where the verdict was delivered at 5.30am, the prime minister and his aides had a series of instant and tricky decisions to make. Officials with Johnson had said it would take time to digest what they called an \u201cextraordinary\u201d ruling and provide a response, and there was no indication when or how this would come. The prime minister was scheduled to make what had been billed as the major Brexit-related speech of his two-day trip at about 8am (1pm BST), telling US business leaders and investors about how the country would change after departure. Johnson was expected to have a series of bilateral talks, including with President Donald Trump and Ireland\u2019s Leo Varadkar, and to make his speech to the general assembly. Johnson and his team face a difficult decision on whether to keep to this agenda, or to head to London. One option could be to take the prime ministerial plane back to London late on Tuesday rather than, as planned, first thing on Wednesday. If the current schedule is maintained, Johnson would not be back in No 10 until late Wednesday night \u2013 a long delay amid calls for his resignation. Speaking to reporters on the flight over, Johnson had said he would not resign if the case went against him. Conservative MPs were largely silent on the issue but Rory Stewart, who lost the whip over Brexit last month, called for a new cross-party effort to pass a Brexit deal.",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s a hot, humid evening and I\u2019m sitting on the ground with around 50,000 other people, all about to watch <a href=\"https://www.cloudgate.org.tw/en/cloud-gate-theater.html\">Cloud</a><a href=\"https://www.cloudgate.org.tw/en/cloud-gate-theater.html\"> Gate Dance Theatre</a> give its annual outdoor performance in Taipei. The atmosphere in Liberty Plaza is extraordinary. I can\u2019t think of another dance company in the world that could draw so large and so festive a crowd. Most of the audience have brought picnics, many enduring a day of rainstorms to bag a position close to the stage. Yet, although this is a special performance \u2013 one of the last before Cloud Gate\u2019s founding director <a href=\"https://www.cloudgate.org.tw/en/cg-lin-hwai-min.html\">Lin Hwai-min</a> steps down \u2013 such devotion has been normal for the company almost since it was formed.</p> <p>Cloud Gate was named as the outstanding company at the British <a href=\"http://criticscircle.org.uk/national-dance-awards-2018/\">National Dance </a><a href=\"http://criticscircle.org.uk/national-dance-awards-2018/\">awards</a> last year and is a headline attraction of the new Sadler\u2019s Wells season. Lin\u2019s success in turning a small experimental dance company into a national icon and international brand is a remarkable story. Now 71, with a fierce energy and a huge crinkled smile, Lin acknowledges that he had almost no experience of professional dance when he staged his first programme back in 1973, and discovered that he\u2019d sold 3,000 tickets for just two shows. \u201cI almost had a nervous breakdown,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought, \u2018My god, now I have to learn how to choreograph.\u2019\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I am from a generation who believe it is their duty to make a difference</p> <footer> <cite>Lin Hwai-min</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the south of Taiwan, where Lin grew up, there had been very little dance to see. At the age of five he fell in love with the film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/dec/10/the-red-shoes-film-review\">The Red Shoes</a> but nine years later, when he took his first ballet class, it proved a huge disappointment: \u201cI had a book, All You Need to Know About Ballet, and I could tell that the teacher wasn\u2019t doing things correctly.\u201d Already a precociously literary teenager, inspired by Hemingway, Fitzgerald and classical Chinese poetry, Lin focused his energies on becoming a writer. By the age of 22, he\u2019d published his first collection of short stories and had been offered a fellowship at the International Writers\u2019 Programme in Idaho.</p> <p>Once he arrived in the US, though, contemporary dance grabbed his imagination. Lin was able to see the companies of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/aug/31/paul-taylor-modern-dance\">Paul Taylor</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/dance-blog/2014/jul/25/remembering-merce-cunningham-five-contemporary-dance-videos\">Merce Cunningham</a> and Jos\u00e9 Lim\u00f3n \u2013 and take classes at the Martha Graham school. He even created his first work: a tortuously complicated piece, he now realises, about \u201ca philosopher who dreams he becomes a butterfly\u201d. When he returned to Taipei, he was by default the local expert on contemporary dance. With musicians, dancers and artists all curious to know more, he was persuaded to set up a company.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b18053e1f1251cb161341c2ba476c433a19e870\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b18053e1f1251cb161341c2ba476c433a19e870/0_223_5698_3419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beckoning by Cloud Gate 2, a sister company set up to enact grassroots change.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beckoning by Cloud Gate 2, a sister company set up to enact grassroots change.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI was stupid,\u201d he says. \u201cI was very young but I came from a generation who believed it was their duty to make a difference to the world.\u201d The works Lin began to choreograph blended modern dance, classical ballet, Chinese folk dance and Chinese opera, grounded in the silken stillness of tai chi. They also drew on distinctively Taiwanese subject matter: Portrait of the Families addressed the massacre of political and intellectual dissidents under Chiang Kai-shek; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/feb/18/lin-hwai-min-cloud-gate-dance-theatre-rice\">the pastoral masterpiece Rice</a> evoked the rhythms and landscape of rural Taiwan.</p> <p>This choice of local subject matter was radical in itself: during the 28 years of Chiang\u2019s regime, as well the Japanese rule that preceded it, the island\u2019s language and culture had been brutally repressed. When Lin created his 1978 work Legacy, about early Taiwanese settlers, he had to stage the premiere in the south of the island, far away from the National Security Bureau in Taipei.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f5ab8fe4d59b9d1237495b668ca4e2c5148991a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5ab8fe4d59b9d1237495b668ca4e2c5148991a4/0_253_5076_6342/800.jpg\" alt=\"Mentor \u2026 Lin Hwai-min, left, with Cheng Tsung-lung.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mentor \u2026 Lin Hwai-min, left, with Cheng Tsung-lung.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Liu Chen-hsiang</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But as challenging as those early years were, Lin says: \u201cIt is wonderful to be an artist here. In 1987, we ended martial law. In 1996, we had our first direct presidential election. Now we have a woman president and we have legalised gay marriage.\u201d It matters profoundly to him that he has been an instrument for change, helping to found a flourishing dance department at the National Arts University and using a second company, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/nov/22/cloud-gate-2-review-sadlers-wells\">Cloud</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/nov/22/cloud-gate-2-review-sadlers-wells\"> Gate 2</a>, to bring dance classes and performance to impoverished regions of Taiwan.</p> <p>The love he\u2019s earned is palpable. Back in the early 90s, when he tried to shuck off the exhausting burden of Cloud Gate, Lin was shamed into returning by a reproachful taxi driver, who said to him: \u201cThere is hardship in every profession, Mr Lin. It is hard for me to earn a living in the traffic of Taipei. But we need Cloud Gate. So drive on.\u201d</p> <p>In 2008, when the company\u2019s rehearsal base was destroyed by a fire, Lin did not have to ask for help in building a new home: more than 4,000 people spontaneously sent donations, including one small boy who offered all of his pocket money. While others might cling on to such love, Lin is adamant that he\u2019s \u201csimply looking after a public property\u201d: his final gift to Cloud Gate will be to step down at the end of this year having created as smooth a transition as possible for his successor.</p> <p>Lin has been mentoring <a href=\"https://www.cloudgate.org.tw/en/cg-cheng-tsung-lung.html\">Cheng Tsung-lung</a> for years, watching him develop as a dancer and choreographer, appointing him director of Cloud Gate 2 in 2014, but he\u2019s delighted that Cheng is a very different artist from him. \u201cI came from a family of poets and scholars but Tsung-lung came from mud,\u201d he says. \u201cI envy him that.\u201d Lin points to that fact that, while his mother made him listen to Schubert and Beethoven after school, Cheng\u2019s parents had him working the street markets from the age of eight, selling slippers made at his father\u2019s factory.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/360272452\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/360272452?app_id=122963\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The two men do, however, share a childhood interest in dance. Cheng, talking through a translator, says he was \u201ca very active little boy, always bumping into things, with too much energy\u201d and was sent to dance classes to calm down. He describes how rapidly he learned that showing off his moves in the market brought business to his stall. Even though he endured a troubled adolescence, getting involved with serious drugs and sentenced to two years\u2019 probation and community service, Cheng continued to stick with dance.</p> <p>When there was a choice between going into the slipper factory or going to university, he opted to study dance at degree level. \u201cIt was the only thing I was good at,\u201d he laughs, although he says it was only when a back injury forced him to focus temporarily on choreography that he discovered a true sense of vocation. \u201cWhen I was a child, I used to make up stories about the people on the street. I didn\u2019t have many opportunities to go to cinema, and it was like making my own films.\u201d Once Cheng realised that creating dance was like an extension of those childhood fantasies, his work developed rapidly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e5789f14a190f910c07ea6a9e9dc347793e73164\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e5789f14a190f910c07ea6a9e9dc347793e73164/0_330_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Raking new ground \u2026 Song of the Wanderers by Cloud Gate.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Against the grain \u2026 a performance of Song of the Wanderers by Cloud Gate.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yu Hui-hung</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lin says it\u2019s been one of the highlights of his career to watch Cheng mature: \u201cHe gets scared, turns into a skeleton during the creative process, but it is wonderful to see. His work is very different from mine, very dark, and he can speak to the internet generation in a way that I can\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.cloudgate.org.tw/en/production-13-tongues.html\">13 Tongues</a>, which Cloud Gate will bring to London next year, is typical of Cheng\u2019s work in its fusion of local Taiwanese culture, contemporary music and a sophisticated digital sensibility. It\u2019s a fantastical but deeply urban piece, redolent both of ancient superstitions and the clamour of modern Taipei, with black-clad dancers massing in ritualised patterns against a digitally created art work, calling out the raucous rhythmic chants of street hawkers and singing Taoist chants.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/gallery/2018/may/03/amazing-grace-45-years-of-cloud-gate-dance-theatre-in-pictures\">Amazing grace: 45 years of Cloud Gate Dance Theatre \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cheng, aged 43, talks and dresses like a member of modern, edgy Taipei, but he brings a very old-fashioned sense of commitment to his job: \u201cMy responsibility is about how I can keep on working for dance and connecting it with all the people here,\u201d he says, recalling his first experiences of community work with Cloud Gate 2. \u201cWe were going into remote parts of Taiwan to help people liberate what\u2019s inside of them, and it reminded me of when I was a child, when the street vendors would start playing their cassettes and everyone would be dancing and enjoying their bodies.\u201d</p> <p>His reverence for Cloud Gate\u2019s contribution to the island as a whole is touchingly direct. \u201cIt has brought us inspiration and dignity. At first, when people came to watch the company, they didn\u2019t know how to behave in a public place, they didn\u2019t know about not talking or not leaving their trash.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s a hot, humid evening and I\u2019m sitting on the ground with around 50,000 other people, all about to watch Cloud Gate Dance Theatre give its annual outdoor performance in Taipei. The atmosphere in Liberty Plaza is extraordinary. I can\u2019t think of another dance company in the world that could draw so large and so festive a crowd. Most of the audience have brought picnics, many enduring a day of rainstorms to bag a position close to the stage. Yet, although this is a special performance \u2013 one of the last before Cloud Gate\u2019s founding director Lin Hwai-min steps down \u2013 such devotion has been normal for the company almost since it was formed. Cloud Gate was named as the outstanding company at the British National Dance awards last year and is a headline attraction of the new Sadler\u2019s Wells season. Lin\u2019s success in turning a small experimental dance company into a national icon and international brand is a remarkable story. Now 71, with a fierce energy and a huge crinkled smile, Lin acknowledges that he had almost no experience of professional dance when he staged his first programme back in 1973, and discovered that he\u2019d sold 3,000 tickets for just two shows. \u201cI almost had a nervous breakdown,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought, \u2018My god, now I have to learn how to choreograph.\u2019\u201d In the south of Taiwan, where Lin grew up, there had been very little dance to see. At the age of five he fell in love with the film The Red Shoes but nine years later, when he took his first ballet class, it proved a huge disappointment: \u201cI had a book, All You Need to Know About Ballet, and I could tell that the teacher wasn\u2019t doing things correctly.\u201d Already a precociously literary teenager, inspired by Hemingway, Fitzgerald and classical Chinese poetry, Lin focused his energies on becoming a writer. By the age of 22, he\u2019d published his first collection of short stories and had been offered a fellowship at the International Writers\u2019 Programme in Idaho. Once he arrived in the US, though, contemporary dance grabbed his imagination. Lin was able to see the companies of Paul Taylor, Merce Cunningham and Jos\u00e9 Lim\u00f3n \u2013 and take classes at the Martha Graham school. He even created his first work: a tortuously complicated piece, he now realises, about \u201ca philosopher who dreams he becomes a butterfly\u201d. When he returned to Taipei, he was by default the local expert on contemporary dance. With musicians, dancers and artists all curious to know more, he was persuaded to set up a company. \u201cI was stupid,\u201d he says. \u201cI was very young but I came from a generation who believed it was their duty to make a difference to the world.\u201d The works Lin began to choreograph blended modern dance, classical ballet, Chinese folk dance and Chinese opera, grounded in the silken stillness of tai chi. They also drew on distinctively Taiwanese subject matter: Portrait of the Families addressed the massacre of political and intellectual dissidents under Chiang Kai-shek; the pastoral masterpiece Rice evoked the rhythms and landscape of rural Taiwan. This choice of local subject matter was radical in itself: during the 28 years of Chiang\u2019s regime, as well the Japanese rule that preceded it, the island\u2019s language and culture had been brutally repressed. When Lin created his 1978 work Legacy, about early Taiwanese settlers, he had to stage the premiere in the south of the island, far away from the National Security Bureau in Taipei. But as challenging as those early years were, Lin says: \u201cIt is wonderful to be an artist here. In 1987, we ended martial law. In 1996, we had our first direct presidential election. Now we have a woman president and we have legalised gay marriage.\u201d It matters profoundly to him that he has been an instrument for change, helping to found a flourishing dance department at the National Arts University and using a second company, Cloud Gate 2, to bring dance classes and performance to impoverished regions of Taiwan. The love he\u2019s earned is palpable. Back in the early 90s, when he tried to shuck off the exhausting burden of Cloud Gate, Lin was shamed into returning by a reproachful taxi driver, who said to him: \u201cThere is hardship in every profession, Mr Lin. It is hard for me to earn a living in the traffic of Taipei. But we need Cloud Gate. So drive on.\u201d In 2008, when the company\u2019s rehearsal base was destroyed by a fire, Lin did not have to ask for help in building a new home: more than 4,000 people spontaneously sent donations, including one small boy who offered all of his pocket money. While others might cling on to such love, Lin is adamant that he\u2019s \u201csimply looking after a public property\u201d: his final gift to Cloud Gate will be to step down at the end of this year having created as smooth a transition as possible for his successor. Lin has been mentoring Cheng Tsung-lung for years, watching him develop as a dancer and choreographer, appointing him director of Cloud Gate 2 in 2014, but he\u2019s delighted that Cheng is a very different artist from him. \u201cI came from a family of poets and scholars but Tsung-lung came from mud,\u201d he says. \u201cI envy him that.\u201d Lin points to that fact that, while his mother made him listen to Schubert and Beethoven after school, Cheng\u2019s parents had him working the street markets from the age of eight, selling slippers made at his father\u2019s factory. The two men do, however, share a childhood interest in dance. Cheng, talking through a translator, says he was \u201ca very active little boy, always bumping into things, with too much energy\u201d and was sent to dance classes to calm down. He describes how rapidly he learned that showing off his moves in the market brought business to his stall. Even though he endured a troubled adolescence, getting involved with serious drugs and sentenced to two years\u2019 probation and community service, Cheng continued to stick with dance. When there was a choice between going into the slipper factory or going to university, he opted to study dance at degree level. \u201cIt was the only thing I was good at,\u201d he laughs, although he says it was only when a back injury forced him to focus temporarily on choreography that he discovered a true sense of vocation. \u201cWhen I was a child, I used to make up stories about the people on the street. I didn\u2019t have many opportunities to go to cinema, and it was like making my own films.\u201d Once Cheng realised that creating dance was like an extension of those childhood fantasies, his work developed rapidly. Lin says it\u2019s been one of the highlights of his career to watch Cheng mature: \u201cHe gets scared, turns into a skeleton during the creative process, but it is wonderful to see. His work is very different from mine, very dark, and he can speak to the internet generation in a way that I can\u2019t.\u201d 13 Tongues, which Cloud Gate will bring to London next year, is typical of Cheng\u2019s work in its fusion of local Taiwanese culture, contemporary music and a sophisticated digital sensibility. It\u2019s a fantastical but deeply urban piece, redolent both of ancient superstitions and the clamour of modern Taipei, with black-clad dancers massing in ritualised patterns against a digitally created art work, calling out the raucous rhythmic chants of street hawkers and singing Taoist chants. Cheng, aged 43, talks and dresses like a member of modern, edgy Taipei, but he brings a very old-fashioned sense of commitment to his job: \u201cMy responsibility is about how I can keep on working for dance and connecting it with all the people here,\u201d he says, recalling his first experiences of community work with Cloud Gate 2. \u201cWe were going into remote parts of Taiwan to help people liberate what\u2019s inside of them, and it reminded me of when I was a child, when the street vendors would start playing their cassettes and everyone would be dancing and enjoying their bodies.\u201d His reverence for Cloud Gate\u2019s contribution to the island as a whole is touchingly direct. \u201cIt has brought us inspiration and dignity. At first, when people came to watch the company, they didn\u2019t know how to behave in a public place, they didn\u2019t know about not talking or not leaving their trash. This society loves Cloud Gate and Mr Lin \u2013 but Mr Lin has also brought society to a higher place.\u201d Cloud Gate will perform at Sadler\u2019s Wells, London, in February.",

He said a few months before the theft, he received a visit from a journalist from Italian state broadcaster Rai, who wanted to interview him about the Caravaggio for a programme called The Forgotten Masterpieces. He declined the offer. \u201cI told the journalist that if the public learned such a painting existed, then its theft was assured because there were no security measures in place for that painting.\u201d</p> \n<p>Rai did however obtain permission from the same Palermo superintendent who later reported Rocco to the police, to broadcast images of the Caravaggio. The priest\u2019s warning became prophecy \u2013 mere months later, the Nativity was stolen.</p> \n<p>The 2001 interview lay locked in a drawer until last year, when the the Sicilian association <a href=\"http://www.amicimuseisiciliani.it/amicideimusei/\">Amici dei Musei</a>, which is promoting the restoration of the Oratory of San Lorenzo, learned that Rocco had given an interview and got in touch with D\u2019Anolfi. It asked him to organise an exclusive screening in Palermo on the 50th anniversary of the theft.</p> \n<p>The director said that at the time of the interview he thought the police had already investigated Rocco\u2019s claims. \u201cThe priest said he had informed the police about all this. To be honest, I thought that the information contained in that interview was already in the possession of the authorities.</p> \n<p>\u201cHowever, in hindsight, Benedetto\u2019s revelations look more credible now that the recent investigation has confirmed his version of the facts. Sometimes I think that if this interview came out before, maybe people would have thought he was just a crazy priest.\u201d</p> \n<p>The unedited interview will be shown at Palermo\u2019s Teatro Biondo on 15 October, during a week of cultural activities supported by the association <a href=\"https://leviedeitesori.com/palermo/\">Le Vie dei Tesori</a> featuring other stolen artworks still missing.</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 17 October 2019 because an earlier version transposed the first and last names of Monsignor Benedetto Rocco, and also transposed the names in the title of the painting. This has been corrected.</p>",

In an video interview filmed in 2001, but locked in a drawer and now revealed exclusively to the Guardian, the parish priest of the Oratory of San Lorenzo revealed astonishing details of the October 1969 theft of Merisi da Caravaggio\u2019s Nativity with St Francis and St Lawrence. Monsignor Benedetto Rocco, who died in 2013, said the painting was in the home of notorious Sicilian mafia boss Gaetano Badalamenti \u2013 a claim only confirmed for the first time by investigators last year \u2013 and said he had attempted to extort the church for its return. \u201cA few months after [the theft], a letter arrived at my home,\u201d Rocco explained to film director Massimo D\u2019Anolfi, who had filmed the interview for a documentary he was working on at the time about stolen artworks. \u201cIn the letter, the thieves declared: \u2018We have the painting.

He said a few months before the theft, he received a visit from a journalist from Italian state broadcaster Rai, who wanted to interview him about the Caravaggio for a programme called The Forgotten Masterpieces. He declined the offer. \u201cI told the journalist that if the public learned such a painting existed, then its theft was assured because there were no security measures in place for that painting.\u201d Rai did however obtain permission from the same Palermo superintendent who later reported Rocco to the police, to broadcast images of the Caravaggio. The priest\u2019s warning became prophecy \u2013 mere months later, the Nativity was stolen. The 2001 interview lay locked in a drawer until last year, when the the Sicilian association Amici dei Musei, which is promoting the restoration of the Oratory of San Lorenzo, learned that Rocco had given an interview and got in touch with D\u2019Anolfi. It asked him to organise an exclusive screening in Palermo on the 50th anniversary of the theft. The director said that at the time of the interview he thought the police had already investigated Rocco\u2019s claims. \u201cThe priest said he had informed the police about all this. To be honest, I thought that the information contained in that interview was already in the possession of the authorities. \u201cHowever, in hindsight, Benedetto\u2019s revelations look more credible now that the recent investigation has confirmed his version of the facts. Sometimes I think that if this interview came out before, maybe people would have thought he was just a crazy priest.\u201d The unedited interview will be shown at Palermo\u2019s Teatro Biondo on 15 October, during a week of cultural activities supported by the association Le Vie dei Tesori featuring other stolen artworks still missing. \u2022 This article was amended on 17 October 2019 because an earlier version transposed the first and last names of Monsignor Benedetto Rocco, and also transposed the names in the title of the painting. This has been corrected.",

      "bodyText": "Updated tables: Top try and points scorers: Here you go: A possible third red card: It\u2019s worth noting that the reckless Yury Kushnarev tackle that ended Afaeseiti Amosa\u2019s tournament in the 43rd minute was almost certainly worthy of a red card too. Romain Poite immediately went for the yellow card, without consulting his TMO to see if a harsher punishment should be forthcoming. Gong! It\u2019s all over and Samoa have secured a bonus point win against a game Russia side that led the contest by 6-5 at half-time. The conversation around this entertaining games will almost certainly centre around the lucky escape of two Samoan players in the first half, who escaped with yellow cards, when perhaps they should both have got reds. Just five days into this tournament and there\u2019s already something of a crisis with officialdom to be sorted out. 79 min: Russia 9-34 Samoa: Alapati Leiua scores his second of the game, after amore good handling from Samoa as they work the ball out the back line. He does well to stay in touch, handing off a tackler before going off the line. Not for the first time, Samoa fail to convert but it doesn\u2019t matter. 78 min Russia 9-29 Samoa: Stat alert: Samoa have made 466 metres from their 102 carries. Russia, by contrast, have made a comparatively paltry 242 metres from their 123. 77 min Russia 9-29 Samoa: Evgeny Matveev is penalised for offside as Tagir Gadzhiev gets ball in hand and charges for the Samoa line. Samoa\u2019s players celebrate the penalty that allows them to clear the danger. 74 min Russia 9-29 Samoa: A good cross-kick from replacement Russia fly-half Ramil Gaisin is knocked on. Russia win a scrum on the Samoa 22. Ushanka-hats off to them for not giving up after a torrid spell in the 20 minutes after half-time. They really want to score a try. 72 min Russia 9-29 Samoa: Russia scrum on the Samoa five-metre line. They win it but subsequently give the ball away, allowing Samoa to boot the ball to the halfway line. Several minutes\u2019 worth of intense Russian pressure go to waste. 71 min Russia 9-29 Samoa: Citing a lack of conclusive evidence from the replays, TMO Graham Hughes tells Romain Poite he can\u2019t advise him to overturn his decision not to award a try. Boo!!! 70 min Russia 9-29 Samoa: Russia appear to get over the Samoa line for a try, but Romain Poite awards them an attacking scrum, before sending it upstairs to the TMO. I have no idea who was at the bottom of that pile of bodies, but they did appear to ground the ball. 69 min Russia 9-29 Samoa: Russia win a lineout about five metres from the Samoa line. They deserve a try for effort. One drive after another is repelled, while the Japanese crowd roar them on. 68 min Russia 9-29 Samoa: Russia are just to the left of the Samoa posts, five metres from the tryline. Openside flanker Tagir Gadzhiev tries to charge for the line, but is stopped. 63 min Russia 9-29 Samoa: Samoa are camped in the Russia 22. They go over again, taking advantage of another overlap, as Rey Lee-Lo grounds the ball in the corner after excellent work by centre Henry Taefu. Tusi Pisi pulls his conversion attempt wide of the left post. 60 min Russia 9-24 Samoa: Samoa have really upped their game in this second half and are now making bits of a Russia pack that were dominant in the first 40 minutes. The Russians, understandably, are getting very tired. They could have done with more than three days between their first and second matches. 58 min Russia 9-24 Samoa Samoa scrum on the Russia five-metre line. They lose it and Gaisin boots the ball clear. On the touchline, Samoa No8 and try-scorer Afaesetti Amosa has just hobbled to the bench on a pair of crutches, his entire leg mummified in a white bandage going from groin to ankle. I suspect his tournament may be over. 57 min Russia 9-24 Samoa changes from both sides. Russia change their half-backs, with Dimitry Petrov and Ramil Gaisin coming on. Russia prop Kirill Gotovtsev has returned from a spell in the sin bin that was very expensive for his team. 53 min Russia 9-24 Samoa A good offload and Samoa speedily work the ball out their backs with some deft handling. Having created an overlap, Fidow takes a pass from Nanai-Williams and goes over for his second try in quick succession. Tusi Pisi scores the conversion. 50 min Russia 9-17 Samoa From a ruck, Ray Niuia takes the ball, peeloing off the back of a maul and plays a clever no-look inside pass inside for Ed Fidow to run on to before scything through the Russian defence. He scores under the posts and the extras are duly added. 47 min Russia 9-10 Samoa: Good defence by Samoa as Russia camp on the edge of their 22. Russia reduce the deficit with a drop goal; Kushnarev bisecting the posts. 45 min Russia 6-10 Samoa: Play is paused as Samoa try-scorer Amosa receives treatment and is put on a stretcher. He seems to have done a right number on his hamstring in scoring that try. He\u2019s carried off and replaced by Josh Tyrell. 43 min Russia 6-10 Samoa: Samoa No8 Afaeseiti Amosa charges over the line, but injures his hamstring in doing so. Russia prop Kirill Gotvotsev is sin-binned for an illegal seatbelt tackle on the No8 as he went over the line. Samoa miss the conversion. 44 min Russia 6-5 Samoa: Henry Taefu charges towards the Russia tryline, but runs into a wall of resistance. 42 min Russia 6-5 Samoa: Russia go through the phases, nine of them, but lose possession when one of their forwards, Valery Morozov, goes off his feet in a maul. Samoa get the chance to clear their lines and make ground towards the edge of the Russia 22. 41 min: Play resumes and Samoa have made a substitution. Melani Matavao has replaced Dwayne Polataivao at scrum-half. Irish rugby expert Andy McGeady tweets .... It\u2019s hard to disagree with him, I have to say. An entertaining first half draws to a close as the players troop off following the half-time gong. Samoa scored the only try of the game through winger Alapati Leiua, but trail by a point after Yury Kushnarev scored two from the tee. Russia will feel they should have put more distance between themselves and their opponents, having had a two-man advantage for almost 10 minutes. Samoa, for their part, have every right to feel relieved that they didn\u2019t lose two players to red, instead of yellow cards. 40 min Russia 6-5 Samoa While all that was going on, incidentally, Russia winger German Davydov and Samoa winger Ed Fidow were engaged in a spot of off-the-ball fisticuffs, prompting Romain Poite to have a word with both of them. 39 min Russia 6-5 Samoa Samoa full-back Tim Nanai-Williams drops a high ball deep inside his own 22, but manages to scramble it clear. Moments later, a clearing kick from Samoa fly-half Pisi is charged down by Vladimir Ostroushko, who is unable to touch it down for the try. 37 min Russia 6-5 Samoa Russia scrum, just inside the Samoa half. Meanwhile on the sideline, Samoa\u2019s two miscreants are preparing to come back on to the field. His spell on the Naughty Step over, Rey Lee-Lo is first back on to the pitch. 34 min Russia 6-5 Samoa With a two-man advantage, Russia kick deep and cede possession to Samoa. They then foolishly concede a penalty near the halfway line. Samoa fly-half Tusi Pisi has the distance, but not the accuracy - he sends the ball a mite wide of the right upright. 33 min Russia 6-5 Samoa Samoa win a lineout and are very slow to take it as they try to waste time in a bid to stop Russia capitalising on their two-man advantage. Russia scrum-half Vasily Dorofeev sends the ball high into the night sky and play resumed on the halfway line, with Samoa in possession. 32 min Russia 6-5 Samoa Ray Niuia comes off the bench for Samoa, to make up their complement of front-rowers in the absence of hooker Motu Matu\u2019u. 30 min Russia 3-5 Samoa: Citing the same mitigating circumstances as in the previous case, referee Romain Poite sends Motu Matu\u2019u to the sin bin. He makes his way down the tunnel for a Head Injury Assessment while he\u2019s at it. 30 min Russia 6-5 Samoa Motu Matu\u2019u puts in a massive hit on Russia full-back Vasily Artemyev and appears to knock himself out in the process. Matu\u2019u caught him on the head with his shoulder and may see red for this. 27 min Russia 6-5 Samoa: There\u2019s a break in play as referee Romain Poite studies the big screen after a misjudged tackle from Samoa\u2019s Rey Lee-Lo catches Russia full-back Vasily Artemyev on the head. It\u2019s a red card offence, but there are mitigating circumstances. Artemyev dipped his head into the tackle by a matter of inches and that gets the tackler off the hook, up to a point. Lee-Lo gets away with a yellow card and heads for the sin bin for 10 minutes. He\u2019s a lucky boy. 25 min Russia 6-5 Samoa: An excellent break down the middle from Russia scrum-half Vasily Dorofeev helps Russia win a penalty. Yury Kushnarev makes no mistake from the tee and puts his side ahead. 22 min Russia 3-5 Samoa: Good work from Russia full-back Vasily Artemyev, who sells Alapati Leiua a dummy and makes ground down the far touchline. 19 min Russia 3-5 Samoa: Russia fly-half Yury Kushnarev responds almost immediately, getting three points on the baord from a penalty. 16 min Russia 0-5 Samoa: Samaoa No14 Alapati Leiua comes in off his wing to receive a pass and go over in the corner for the opening score of the game. It was a good try, finishing a move that saw the Samoans go through the phases. They miss the conversion. 14 min Russia 0-0 Samoa: Russia win a penalty after forcing the Samoa scrum to disintegrate with a good drive. Kushnarev kicks for touch, but Russia lose the ensuing lineout. 12 min Russia 0-0 Samoa: Good play from Samoa, who work the ball from right wing to left, showing some good handling skills in the process. THey win themselves a lineout about 12 metres from the Russia line. Oh dear, hooker Moyu Matuu is penalised for not throwing the ball in straight. Scrum for Russia. 10 min Russia 0-0 Samoa: There\u2019s a break in play as Russia No7 Tagir Gadzhiev has a large wad of tissue wedged up a bleeding nostril. Russia scrum, inside their own 22. They win a penalty when Logovi Molipoli is caught pushing too soon. 8 min Russia 0-0 Samoa: A promising Samoa assault on the Russia tryline ends in tears as Fidow fumbles a pass out the touchline after receiving a pass from Rey Lee-Lo. 7min Russia 0-0 Samoa: Russia outside centre Vladimir Ostroushko is penalised for offside, allowing Samoa to kick for the 22. They win the ensuing lineout and start applying pressure just inside the Russia 22-metre line. 6 min Russia 0-0 Samoa: A good start from Russia, who are dominating early doors. They cede possession to Samoa inside the Pacific Islanders\u2019 22, however. Scrum it down, Samoa with the put-in. 3 min Russia 0-0 Samoa: Russia prop Valery Morozov takes what looks to be a forward pass from his outside-half Kushnarev and makes 10 metres up the centre. Soon after, winger Kiril Golosnitskiy is sent on his way down the touchline, but is bundled into touch by a good tackle from Samoa winger Ah See Tuala. 2 min Russia 0-0 Samoa: Nanai-Williams kicks the ball downfield, as his team-mate Ed Fidow, a winger, receives treatment for an arm injury elsewhere on the field. 1 min Russia 0-0 Samoa: Samoa kick off, with full-back Tim Nanai-Williams booting the ball straight down the centre. Russia, playing after a brutal three-day turnaround, win a lineout and then a penalty on their own 22. Yury Kushnarev, their fly-half, clears their lines. Samoa begin with the Siva Tau: Russia\u2019s players stand in a line with their arms around each other\u2019s shoulders as they face the traditional Samoan war dance, which is performed in reverential silence before being applauded by the capacity crowd on what we\u2019re told is \u201ca steamy night in Kumagaya. Kick-off is just moments away. Not long now: The teams march out on to the pitch, with the players of underdogs Russia wearing red shirts, red shorts and red, white and blue socks. Samoa\u2019s troops wear blue shirts with red trim, white shorts and blue socks. They line up either side of match referee Romain Poite and his touch judges for the national anthems. In other Pool A news: Johnny Sexton did not train fully on Tuesday but Ireland still expect him fit to face Japan on Saturday in Shizuoka. Skills coach Richie Murphy insisted it \u201cwouldn\u2019t be unusual\u201d for fly-half Sexton to sit out a training session just 48 hours after playing in a Test. Keith Earls, Rob Kearney and Joey Carbery are all fit and available for selection against Japan, leaving Robbie Henshaw as Ireland\u2019s only major injury concern - should Sexton shake off his thigh knock. World Rugby speaks: World Rugby has issued an extraordinary statement criticising the performance of its referees after only eight games. The highest-profile blunder has been Ben O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s failure to punish Australia wing Reece Hodge for a shoulder-led, no-arms tackle to the head of Fiji\u2019s Peceli Yato in Sapporo on Saturday. Yato subsequently failed a head injury assessment and Hodge has since been cited. In Friday\u2019s tournament opener, meanwhile, Japan lock James Moore escaped sanction for a no-arms tackle. \u201cFollowing the usual review of matches, the match officials team recognise that performances over the opening weekend were not consistently of the standards set by World Rugby and themselves,\u201d the World Rugby statement read. \u201cBut World Rugby is confident of the highest standards of officiating moving forward. Elite match officials are required to make decisions in complex, high-pressure situations and there have been initial challenges with the use of technology and team communication, which have impacted decision-making. \u201cThese are already being addressed by the team of 23 match officials to enhance consistency. Given this proactive approach, a strong team ethic and a superb support structure, World Rugby has every confidence in the team to ensure that Rugby World Cup 2019 delivers the highest levels of accurate, clear and consistent decision-making.\u201d Samoa\u2019s coach speaks: \u201cIt\u2019s a huge opportunity for us,\u201d said New Zealander Steve Jackson. \u201cWhat is a better stage to put Samoan rugby back on the map than at a Rugby World Cup? \u201cWe are here to make our own legacy. We want people to remember the Samoan team at this Rugby World Cup as we have done in 1991 and 1995 with those teams that have reached the quarter-final and done extremely well. Asked about Samoa\u2019s opponents Russia, who they meet for the first time today, Jackson had this to say. \u201cI think they\u2019ve got a good kicking game. They\u2019ve got a big pack but they don\u2019t rely on that, they rely on their set pieces that they carry hard, and they play with passion. This is not just a rugby team, this is their country and we are just the same, we play with passion and it\u2019ll be an exciting match.\u201d No pressure, Monsieur Poite ... In other Pool A news ... A tournament that started badly for Scotland appears to be going quickly downhill. In an ignominious 27-3 defeat at the hands of Ireland, they lost Hamish Watson to a serious, tournament-ending knee injury. It has now been revealed their scrum-half Ali Price has been ruled out for the rest of the Rugby World Cup with an ankle injury. Edinburgh\u2019s Henry Pyrgos is packing his bags and en route to Japan to join up with Gregor Townsend\u2019s squad. Read on ...

There seems to have been a hangover into 2019, with customers calculating that waiting to book is a productive strategy.</p>\n    <p><b>Competition</b><br>A pincer movement of Airbnb and budget holidays has changed consumer behaviour, though Thomas Cook still managed to sell 11m package holidays last year.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Banks and debt</b><br>The tour operator has been attempting to shoulder a&nbsp; huge pile of debt for the past decade \u2013 \u00a31.7bn worth at the last count. Successive managements failed to remove meaningful chunks. The banks argue they have supported an overstretched company for years and the details of why it could not be saved may have to await the report from the Insolvency Service.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Bad management</b><br>Thomas Cook\u2019s borrowings were too high. The moral of the tale is that tour operators should fund themselves conservatively. If your balance sheet is fragile, you are at the mercy of events in an industry where most of the cash arrives in the summer and then flows out in the winter.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/nilspratley\"><b>Nils Pratley</b></a>, financial editor</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Sten Daugaard took over as chief financial officer in December 2018 from Bill Scott, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/24/thomas-cook-profits-warning-uk-heatwave\">who quit after less than a year in the job after Thomas Cook issued a profit warning</a>.

The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) has the authority to investigate and sanction auditors of companies and individuals who are members of the accounting profession. The regulator announced it was considering an investigation after the government fast-tracked the Insolvency Service\u2019s investigation into the collapse of the 178-year-old travel firm. Thomas Cook\u2019s auditor is EY, which took over from PwC in 2017. Both are among the UK\u2019s so-called big four accountancy firms. The tour operator has had a series of finance chiefs over the past two years as its problems deepened. It has also faced questions about its accounting methods. Sten Daugaard took over as chief financial officer in December 2018 from Bill Scott, who quit after less than a year in the job after Thomas Cook issued a profit warning. Scott replaced Michael Healy in January 2018 when Healy stepped down after five years in the job. The FRC said: \u201cIn light of recent developments at Thomas Cook we are considering whether there is any case for investigation and enforcement action as a matter of urgency and in cooperation with the Insolvency Service.\u201d Daugaard changed the way Thomas Cook reported its accounts to include items that had been treated as exceptional costs for several years, including when paying directors and meeting banking covenants. EY disagreed with the company\u2019s treatment of these items. In first-half results reported last November Thomas Cook recognised \u00a328m of charges comprising a \u00a314m write-off of payments from hotels and \u00a314m of flight disruption and business transformation costs. Daugaard told analysts in November that when he had looked at the books \u201cone thing that I could immediately observe was the size of the exceptionals\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Well before the end of his first archery lesson three years ago, it was clear Ben Wood [not his real name] possessed excellent hand-eye coordination but, after only a few months\u2019 tuition, he began hitting previously unimaginable bullseyes. Meeting such targets had nothing to do with bows and arrows. Then aged 14, Wood\u2019s autistic spectrum disorder meant he had previously found taking part in sports and social activities immensely challenging. \u201cBen had tried many different activities but the noise, or the failure of other children to follow the rules, always limited his enjoyment,\u201d says his mother, Julie. \u201cAs his anxieties grew, he stopped attending.\u201d But through a charity offering bespoke sporting sessions, Ben has not only improved his physical fitness, but his emotional wellbeing, too. Operating in Newcastle upon Tyne and across the north-east, uS helps 12 to 25-year-olds with mental health and emotional wellbeing issues improve their quality of life through physical activity. \u201cThe charity approved funding for private archery lessons, but the first session was almost too much. His stress levels were sky high and he was beginning to melt down,\u201d says Julie. \u201cHowever, the trainers were amazing \u2013 and by the end of that session, Ben was hitting the target every time he shot.\u201d Founded by consultant psychiatrist Dr Mary Jane Tacchi and Yvonne Hurlow, an education and training expert, the activities uS offers include yoga, boxercise, circus skills, horse riding, archery, dance and ice-skating. The charity\u2019s founders say Ben is just one success story: so far, the charity has helped just under 250 young people. Independent analysis of its results is planned for next year. Funded by the Barbour Foundation, local businesses and donations, young people are referred to uS by local services such as GPs, hospitals, children\u2019s services, schools and Barnardo\u2019s. They are then assessed and matched to activities. Sessions are mostly taught one-to-one or in a small group with specially trained tutors. The sessions take place at a range of local centres, gyms and riding schools so that young people can continue attending once financial and emotional support from the charity is over. Length of funding varies, but it often lasts for more than one year. Tacchi says the charity is meant to complement existing NHS services. \u201cWe\u2019re not here to replace treatment but as an adjunct,\u201d she says. Yet she also acknowledges there is a lot of unmet need. One in eight children and young people in England aged between 5 and 19 have a diagnosable mental health disorder; less than one in three of them get access to NHS care and treatment. And 2018 figures from the Education Policy Institute show that Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS foundation trust has the second longest median waiting times for treatment, at 145 days from referral to treatment \u2013 and children\u2019s services funding in the north-east has been cut by one-third since 2010. \u201cMental ill-health can have devastating consequences and uS is trying to make a difference,\u201d says one of the charity\u2019s patrons, Olympic gold medallist Steve Cram. For Lauren Head, 19, from Tyneside, yoga has really helped her mental health. \u201cBeing a carer is hard; the pressure and stress placed on you in an already tough situation is a lot to handle,\u201d she says. \u201cI never had time to myself until uS introduced me to yoga.

I only saw this through Chris Moukarbel\u2019s documentary and I didn\u2019t think I would enjoy it as much as I did. It was so much about the way people reacted to the art that was so fascinating: the guys who disassembled the brick sphinx and rebuilt it in their garage to sell on; the Banksy originals being sold in the market at the side of Central Park for a few dollars; and the locals charging money for photographs of the Banksy picture in their neighbourhood. It was a very accessible, broad look at how art affects us. I really enjoyed it.</p> <h2>Yayoi Kusama: Aftermath of Obliteration of Eternity (2009)</h2> <p><strong>\u2018An indelible stamp\u2019: <a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/133230244\">SimonLegend</a></strong></p> <p>It qualifies as an indelible stamp upon a world that unfolds continually into a not so distant, but nonetheless certain, oblivion.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2001/sep/04/artsfeatures.turnerprize2001\">Mike Nelson: The Coral Reef</a> (2000)</h2> <p><strong>\u2018I was completely overwhelmed\u2019: Lewis, 28, Bristol</strong></p> <p>The Coral Reef was one of the most affecting pieces of art I\u2019ve experienced. I found it completely by accident through a door I felt didn\u2019t belong there. From that point I was completely overwhelmed, passing through a series of rooms that were nondescript but oppressive. It was so disorienting that I couldn\u2019t find the way out, and for the most part I was completely alone so couldn\u2019t ask for help. The Coral Reef is a series of offices, waiting rooms and corridors that are grubby and used but feel unspecific and indistinct. For me it represents the mundane spaces that we inhabit every day; the off-licence, the open-plan office, the hotel corridor. They exist out of context with the place they\u2019re in and result in an uncanny feeling of loss of control. It was unsettling and bizarre. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c74b112ff20a405656009637421ff2a0c41c9f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c74b112ff20a405656009637421ff2a0c41c9f8/0_369_5967_3580/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018It\u2019s the most beautiful art object I\u2019ve experienced in my life.\u2019 A still from Ragnar Kjartansson\u2019s The Visitors, 2012, which was our No 1.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It\u2019s the most beautiful art object I\u2019ve experienced in my life.\u2019 A still from Ragnar Kjartansson\u2019s The Visitors, 2012, which was our No 1.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elisabet Davidsdottir</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Olafur Eliasson: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/oct/02/how-we-made-olafur-eliasson-the-weather-project\">The Weather Project</a> (2003)</h2> <p><strong>\u2018Awesome\u2019: <a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/133218055\">BenCaute</a></strong></p> <p>So glad I got to see The Weather Project when it opened.

Lefebvre uses light projection, bits of wire, small mirrors, book illustrations, coloured gels, small motors and mundane objects, which are projected through lenses on to a wall in a darkened room. The contrast between the beautiful projected image of his coffee pot bubbling away on a flame and the way he has created it is wonderful.</p> <p>It\u2019s like you\u2019re looking at a coffee pot for the first time \u2013 a bit like when painters in the middle ages first started using modelling, realistic light and shadow and naturalistic landscape. He doesn\u2019t work on the art gallery circuit (you\u2019ll find him in puppet/animation festivals, theatres or with a French performance company Groupe ZUR), he hasn\u2019t, as far as I know, worked in the UK so his work bypasses the critics.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/sep/17/the-best-visual-art-of-the-21st-century\">The best art of the 21st century</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Roni Horn \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/feb/26/roni-horn-tate-modern\">Pink Tons</a> (2009)</h2> <p><strong>\u2018Absolutely mesmerising\u2019: <a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/133225918\">Crawford_Montazano</a></strong></p> <p>Looks like a big chunk of Turkish Delight, but is in fact 4.5 tons of solid cast glass.

As it was shown on a continuous loop of 64 minutes, it slipped further out of kilter as the day wore on.

      "bodyText": "Banksy: Better Out Than In (2013) \u2018A very accessible broad look at how art affects us\u2019: DietBoke My favourite art project was the Banksy one-month \u201cresidency\u201d in New York. I only saw this through Chris Moukarbel\u2019s documentary and I didn\u2019t think I would enjoy it as much as I did. It was so much about the way people reacted to the art that was so fascinating: the guys who disassembled the brick sphinx and rebuilt it in their garage to sell on; the Banksy originals being sold in the market at the side of Central Park for a few dollars; and the locals charging money for photographs of the Banksy picture in their neighbourhood. It was a very accessible, broad look at how art affects us. I really enjoyed it. Yayoi Kusama: Aftermath of Obliteration of Eternity (2009) \u2018An indelible stamp\u2019: SimonLegend It qualifies as an indelible stamp upon a world that unfolds continually into a not so distant, but nonetheless certain, oblivion. Mike Nelson: The Coral Reef (2000) \u2018I was completely overwhelmed\u2019: Lewis, 28, Bristol The Coral Reef was one of the most affecting pieces of art I\u2019ve experienced. I found it completely by accident through a door I felt didn\u2019t belong there. From that point I was completely overwhelmed, passing through a series of rooms that were nondescript but oppressive. It was so disorienting that I couldn\u2019t find the way out, and for the most part I was completely alone so couldn\u2019t ask for help. The Coral Reef is a series of offices, waiting rooms and corridors that are grubby and used but feel unspecific and indistinct. For me it represents the mundane spaces that we inhabit every day; the off-licence, the open-plan office, the hotel corridor. They exist out of context with the place they\u2019re in and result in an uncanny feeling of loss of control. It was unsettling and bizarre. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. Olafur Eliasson: The Weather Project (2003) \u2018Awesome\u2019: BenCaute So glad I got to see The Weather Project when it opened. It was, in the old-fashioned sense of the word, awesome. What the little spiel doesn\u2019t mention is the use of mist and vapour to soften the air \u2013 you can see the general effect in the picture. Flop Lefebvre: Heureuses Lueurs (2005) \u2018Best art exhibition I\u2019ve seen for a long time\u2019: Alarming This is the best art exhibition I\u2019ve seen for a long time. Lefebvre uses light projection, bits of wire, small mirrors, book illustrations, coloured gels, small motors and mundane objects, which are projected through lenses on to a wall in a darkened room. The contrast between the beautiful projected image of his coffee pot bubbling away on a flame and the way he has created it is wonderful. It\u2019s like you\u2019re looking at a coffee pot for the first time \u2013 a bit like when painters in the middle ages first started using modelling, realistic light and shadow and naturalistic landscape. He doesn\u2019t work on the art gallery circuit (you\u2019ll find him in puppet/animation festivals, theatres or with a French performance company Groupe ZUR), he hasn\u2019t, as far as I know, worked in the UK so his work bypasses the critics. Roni Horn \u2013 Pink Tons (2009) \u2018Absolutely mesmerising\u2019: Crawford_Montazano Looks like a big chunk of Turkish Delight, but is in fact 4.5 tons of solid cast glass. It\u2019s absolutely mesmerising. Ragnar Kjartansson: The Visitors (2012) \u2018The most beautiful art object I\u2019ve experienced\u2019: fromtherooftops Agree with Kjartansson\u2019s The Visitors as No 1. It was shown here in Cardiff at the Artes Mundi festival a few years ago, in the tiny Turner Gallery in Penarth. I went back five times, various friends in tow, to try to drink in all the screens (it was set up 360 degrees, so you couldn\u2019t see it all at once). As it was shown on a continuous loop of 64 minutes, it slipped further out of kilter as the day wore on. We\u2019d listen downstairs for the aural signals of when to enter the \u201ccycle\u201d, so we\u2019d catch the end of one and then get through a full one. It\u2019s the most beautiful art object I\u2019ve experienced in my life.",

It is what mummy bloggers like to call a \u201cteachable moment\u201d. And it shouldn\u2019t teach Trudeau only how incredibly unacceptable and upsetting blackface is. </p> <p>The first big takeaway is that, contrary to popular liberal opinion, the right cares deeply about racism. It has been wonderful to see Andrew Scheer, the Canadian Conservative leader, take this so seriously and insist, with no ulterior motives whatsoever, that Trudeau \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/07/justin-trudeau-says-erosion-of-trust-at-centre-of-political-scandal\" title=\"\">has lost the moral authority to govern</a>\u201d. It has been heartwarming to watch the likes of Tomi Lahren, a Fox News commentator who has been described as a \u201cwhite power Barbie\u201d, decry Trudeau\u2019s transgressions and <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/trudeau-blackface-media-double-standard-tomi-lahren\" title=\"\">insist he take proper responsibility</a>. \u201cDude, you were almost 30 years old \u2026 you should have known better,\u201d she said in response to his lacklustre apology. This is the same woman, by the way, who once called Black Lives Matter \u201cthe new KKK\u201d.</p> <p>The right gets incredibly worked up about social justice issues when there is an opportunity to use them for political gain. Just look at the bad-faith way in which US Republicans have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/06/ilhan-omar-weaponisation-of-anti-semitism\" title=\"\">weaponised antisemitism to attack Ilhan Omar</a> and curtail criticism of the Israeli government, while ignoring or even stoking antisemitism in their own ranks. Look at how outraged about sexual harassment Donald Trump got when the person accused of it was the <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/17/selective-outrage-trump-criticizes-franken-silent-on-moore.html\" title=\"\">Democratic </a><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/17/selective-outrage-trump-criticizes-franken-silent-on-moore.html\" title=\"\">senator Al Franken</a>. You almost have to admire the right for being so shamelessly hypocritical.</p> <p>Progressives must get better at calling out double standards instead of constantly being manipulated by them. However, we must take a critical look at selective outrage in liberal circles, too. Trudeau\u2019s blackface photos are awful; there is no way you could look away from them. But there has been a lot of looking away by some progressives regarding Trudeau\u2019s problematic policies and less in-your-face bigotry. Trudeau has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/21/justin-trudeau-defends-canada-arms-sales-to-saudi-arabia\" title=\"\">defended arms sales to Saudi Arabia</a>, one of the world\u2019s worst human rights violators. He has approved an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/18/canada-trans-mountain-pipeline-expansion-approved-trudeau\" title=\"\">oil pipeline expansion opposed by many environmental and Indigenous groups</a>. He has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/28/justin-trudeau-indigenous-activist-apology-thank-you-donation\" title=\"\">publicly belittled </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/28/justin-trudeau-indigenous-activist-apology-thank-you-donation\" title=\"\">Indigenous activists</a>. He has <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/8/15/20806133/justin-trudeau-snc-lavalin-ethics-report-canada-elections\" title=\"\">violated ethics laws</a>. He has avoided questions about whether a Liberal government would comply with a human rights tribunal ruling <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/trudeau-town-hall-child-welfare-1.5292200\" title=\"\">ordering compensation for First Nations children</a>.</p> <p>Trudeau is no monster; he has spent the past few years upholding refugee rights in Canada and should be commended for it. But he has also spent years basking in a progressive image he doesn\u2019t deserve. For too long, too many people have given him too many passes, preferring to focus on his feelgood soundbites rather than interrogate his less-than-feelgood actions. But the current controversy has made the poster boy of progressivism\u2019s ugly side impossible to ignore. </p> <p>\u2022Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist</p>",

The first big takeaway is that, contrary to popular liberal opinion, the right cares deeply about racism. It has been wonderful to see Andrew Scheer, the Canadian Conservative leader, take this so seriously and insist, with no ulterior motives whatsoever, that Trudeau \u201chas lost the moral authority to govern\u201d. It has been heartwarming to watch the likes of Tomi Lahren, a Fox News commentator who has been described as a \u201cwhite power Barbie\u201d, decry Trudeau\u2019s transgressions and insist he take proper responsibility. \u201cDude, you were almost 30 years old \u2026 you should have known better,\u201d she said in response to his lacklustre apology. This is the same woman, by the way, who once called Black Lives Matter \u201cthe new KKK\u201d. The right gets incredibly worked up about social justice issues when there is an opportunity to use them for political gain. Just look at the bad-faith way in which US Republicans have weaponised antisemitism to attack Ilhan Omar and curtail criticism of the Israeli government, while ignoring or even stoking antisemitism in their own ranks. Look at how outraged about sexual harassment Donald Trump got when the person accused of it was the Democratic senator Al Franken. You almost have to admire the right for being so shamelessly hypocritical. Progressives must get better at calling out double standards instead of constantly being manipulated by them. However, we must take a critical look at selective outrage in liberal circles, too. Trudeau\u2019s blackface photos are awful; there is no way you could look away from them. But there has been a lot of looking away by some progressives regarding Trudeau\u2019s problematic policies and less in-your-face bigotry. Trudeau has defended arms sales to Saudi Arabia, one of the world\u2019s worst human rights violators. He has approved an oil pipeline expansion opposed by many environmental and Indigenous groups. He has publicly belittled Indigenous activists. He has violated ethics laws. He has avoided questions about whether a Liberal government would comply with a human rights tribunal ruling ordering compensation for First Nations children. Trudeau is no monster; he has spent the past few years upholding refugee rights in Canada and should be commended for it. But he has also spent years basking in a progressive image he doesn\u2019t deserve. For too long, too many people have given him too many passes, preferring to focus on his feelgood soundbites rather than interrogate his less-than-feelgood actions. But the current controversy has made the poster boy of progressivism\u2019s ugly side impossible to ignore. \u2022Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist",

(Tips include buying a penis pi\u00f1ata for guests to whack, and tossing melons carved to look like your ex-partner\u2019s face.) Since then, a cottage industry has sprung up, serving the needs of parting divorcees. Need a \u201cDivorced AF\u201d tank top or \u201cAll the single ladies\u201d bunting? No problem.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to recognise divorce as OK and an often positive step,\u201d Gallagher says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve failed or been discarded.\u201d Gallager\u2019s Catholic grandparents were unhappily married, but never divorced; they viscerally hated each other in their final years. Most of her clients are female, although she has thrown parties for men, who favour weekend jaunts to casinos or ski lodges.</p> <p>Is there a cruel side to all this revelry? Gallagher insists that her intention is to help her clients move on in a healthy and respectful way: \u201cI don\u2019t agree with trashing the ex.\u201d Still, melon-chucking and penis-shaped pi\u00f1atas don\u2019t sound like classy ways to signal you are getting over it. And being on the receiving end of a divorce party can be hurtful.</p> <p>For Leah, a student in her 40s from north London, the party her ex-husband threw after they divorced several years ago was calculated to inflict maximum pain. He had been emotionally and financially abusive during their marriage and, after Leah initiated divorce proceedings, he left invitations and a guestlist in her home for her to find. The divorce party was held at her local pub and her ex had invited all their mutual friends, whom he had turned against her. \u201cThe whole thing was designed to hurt me,\u201d Leah says. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that because I\u2019m self-centred. There was no reason for him to come to my local pub and leave the invitation on my coffee table.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In a society that often regards divorce as a failure, divorce parties offer an opportunity to reclaim the narrative</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Barua\u2019s divorce party wasn\u2019t about getting back at her ex, however, but a way to thank the loved ones who had been by her side during the difficult breakup. \u201cMy friends had suggested making a pi\u00f1ata with my ex\u2019s face on it, but I didn\u2019t want to do that, because it wasn\u2019t about him. I wanted to make the party about me and my friends and my support network, and a celebration of my life moving forwards.\u201d</p> <p>Ammanda Major, a therapist at Relate, agrees that divorce parties can be helpful. \u201cIt shows you\u2019re ready to embrace the next stage of your life and talk openly about what happened ... [and] celebrate the fact that you took action to end something that wasn\u2019t working for you,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Divorce parties can also commemorate the end of a protracted, and expensive, legal process. \u201cIt was an extreme relief,\u201d says Caleb, whose marriage broke down after he came out as trans. \u201cThere was a lot of going down to the courthouse. I was never sure if I was doing the papers right.\u201d Catherine Navarro, 35, an area manager from New Jersey, also didn\u2019t realise how difficult it was to obtain a divorce until she tried to begin proceedings. Despite separating from her ex-husband in 2012, Navarro wasn\u2019t able to locate him to serve him with divorce papers. After running a missing persons ad in her local newspaper, Navarro was finally granted a divorce in his absence in May 2019. Walking out of the courthouse, she felt like a teenager again. \u201cI was so happy. I\u2019d never cried tears of happiness like that before.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0bfd0eba4f8d0f91fa260f151c5ce4db8d2f3671\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0bfd0eba4f8d0f91fa260f151c5ce4db8d2f3671/83_282_2936_3669/800.jpg\" alt=\"Catherine Navarro\u2019s divorce party\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It was about celebrating a new chapter of my life\u2019 ...

As our lives are increasingly lived through the glowing squares of social media, public announcements about life landmarks are de rigueur. We track the births of children in real time, downloading new life one pixel at a time through the modern umbilical cord that is the smartphone. Pre-scripted proposals are shared online in excruciating detail. Weddings are elaborate and dizzyingly expensive. (The average cost of a wedding <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/love-sex/wedding-cost-uk-average-how-much-marriage-ceremony-bridebook-a8460451.html\" title=\"\">topped \u00a330,</a><a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/love-sex/wedding-cost-uk-average-how-much-marriage-ceremony-bridebook-a8460451.html\" title=\"\">000 in 2018</a>, an all-time high.) Even separations are now announced via public statement. Why not add divorce parties to the mix?</p> <p>\u201cWe have to have parties for everything now,\u201d says Leah, who doesn\u2019t understand the trend. But divorce parties can be a way to salvage some dignity from the messy wreckage of divorce. Gallagher tells me about the $25,000 (\u00a320,000) party she threw for a client in her 50s, whose husband left her for a younger woman. \u201cIt was an opportunity for her to acknowledge this horribly humiliating event and get ahold of it and say: \u2018I\u2019m fine, I\u2019m moving on and holding my head up high.\u2019\u201d In a society that often regards divorce as a failure, divorce parties offer the newly single the opportunity to reclaim their narratives. \u201cWhen we divorced, people kept saying: \u2018I\u2019m so sorry,\u2019\u201d Barua says. \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t sorry. I was in an unhappy marriage.\u201d</p> <p>Done right, divorce parties can be a celebration of new beginnings, full of joy and hope. \u201cIt was about celebrating a new chapter of my life,\u201d says Navarro. Featuring a \u201cHappily divorced\u201d sign and a sheet cake reading \u201cStraight out of marriage\u201d, her divorce party, held in April, was an uplifting affair, set to a soundtrack of 90s hip-hop. \u201cIt was one of the best nights of my life. I had so much fun.\u201d Caleb\u2019s divorce marked the beginning of a new, more authentic life. \u201cMy marriage was the last thing that tethered me to the period before I came out as trans,\u201d he says. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/19/changing-your-name-nightmare-trans\" title=\"\">My ex was one of the only people who dead</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/19/changing-your-name-nightmare-trans\" title=\"\">named me</a> ... walking out of the courthouse felt like leaving my past behind.\u201d</p> <p>After Barua\u2019s divorce party ended, they all piled down to Brighton beach. Sitting on the stones, she felt free. \u201cThe divorce party was about celebrating that I\u2019d moved on and learned from my mistakes. There was no regret about what happened.\u201d Still, Barua probably wouldn\u2019t remarry. \u201cDivorce is a long process! I wouldn\u2019t want to go through that again.\u201d</p> <p><em>Some names have been changed</em></p>",

No problem. \u201cWe need to recognise divorce as OK and an often positive step,\u201d Gallagher says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve failed or been discarded.\u201d Gallager\u2019s Catholic grandparents were unhappily married, but never divorced; they viscerally hated each other in their final years. Most of her clients are female, although she has thrown parties for men, who favour weekend jaunts to casinos or ski lodges. Is there a cruel side to all this revelry? Gallagher insists that her intention is to help her clients move on in a healthy and respectful way: \u201cI don\u2019t agree with trashing the ex.\u201d Still, melon-chucking and penis-shaped pi\u00f1atas don\u2019t sound like classy ways to signal you are getting over it. And being on the receiving end of a divorce party can be hurtful. For Leah, a student in her 40s from north London, the party her ex-husband threw after they divorced several years ago was calculated to inflict maximum pain. He had been emotionally and financially abusive during their marriage and, after Leah initiated divorce proceedings, he left invitations and a guestlist in her home for her to find. The divorce party was held at her local pub and her ex had invited all their mutual friends, whom he had turned against her. \u201cThe whole thing was designed to hurt me,\u201d Leah says. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that because I\u2019m self-centred. There was no reason for him to come to my local pub and leave the invitation on my coffee table.\u201d Barua\u2019s divorce party wasn\u2019t about getting back at her ex, however, but a way to thank the loved ones who had been by her side during the difficult breakup. \u201cMy friends had suggested making a pi\u00f1ata with my ex\u2019s face on it, but I didn\u2019t want to do that, because it wasn\u2019t about him. I wanted to make the party about me and my friends and my support network, and a celebration of my life moving forwards.\u201d Ammanda Major, a therapist at Relate, agrees that divorce parties can be helpful. \u201cIt shows you\u2019re ready to embrace the next stage of your life and talk openly about what happened ... [and] celebrate the fact that you took action to end something that wasn\u2019t working for you,\u201d she says. Divorce parties can also commemorate the end of a protracted, and expensive, legal process. \u201cIt was an extreme relief,\u201d says Caleb, whose marriage broke down after he came out as trans. \u201cThere was a lot of going down to the courthouse. I was never sure if I was doing the papers right.\u201d Catherine Navarro, 35, an area manager from New Jersey, also didn\u2019t realise how difficult it was to obtain a divorce until she tried to begin proceedings. Despite separating from her ex-husband in 2012, Navarro wasn\u2019t able to locate him to serve him with divorce papers. After running a missing persons ad in her local newspaper, Navarro was finally granted a divorce in his absence in May 2019. Walking out of the courthouse, she felt like a teenager again. \u201cI was so happy. I\u2019d never cried tears of happiness like that before.\u201d It makes sense, in our digitised lives, that we would find a way to celebrate divorce. As our lives are increasingly lived through the glowing squares of social media, public announcements about life landmarks are de rigueur. We track the births of children in real time, downloading new life one pixel at a time through the modern umbilical cord that is the smartphone. Pre-scripted proposals are shared online in excruciating detail. Weddings are elaborate and dizzyingly expensive. (The average cost of a wedding topped \u00a330,000 in 2018, an all-time high.) Even separations are now announced via public statement. Why not add divorce parties to the mix? \u201cWe have to have parties for everything now,\u201d says Leah, who doesn\u2019t understand the trend. But divorce parties can be a way to salvage some dignity from the messy wreckage of divorce. Gallagher tells me about the $25,000 (\u00a320,000) party she threw for a client in her 50s, whose husband left her for a younger woman. \u201cIt was an opportunity for her to acknowledge this horribly humiliating event and get ahold of it and say: \u2018I\u2019m fine, I\u2019m moving on and holding my head up high.\u2019\u201d In a society that often regards divorce as a failure, divorce parties offer the newly single the opportunity to reclaim their narratives. \u201cWhen we divorced, people kept saying: \u2018I\u2019m so sorry,\u2019\u201d Barua says. \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t sorry. I was in an unhappy marriage.\u201d Done right, divorce parties can be a celebration of new beginnings, full of joy and hope. \u201cIt was about celebrating a new chapter of my life,\u201d says Navarro. Featuring a \u201cHappily divorced\u201d sign and a sheet cake reading \u201cStraight out of marriage\u201d, her divorce party, held in April, was an uplifting affair, set to a soundtrack of 90s hip-hop. \u201cIt was one of the best nights of my life. I had so much fun.\u201d Caleb\u2019s divorce marked the beginning of a new, more authentic life. \u201cMy marriage was the last thing that tethered me to the period before I came out as trans,\u201d he says. \u201cMy ex was one of the only people who deadnamed me ... walking out of the courthouse felt like leaving my past behind.\u201d After Barua\u2019s divorce party ended, they all piled down to Brighton beach. Sitting on the stones, she felt free. \u201cThe divorce party was about celebrating that I\u2019d moved on and learned from my mistakes. There was no regret about what happened.\u201d Still, Barua probably wouldn\u2019t remarry. \u201cDivorce is a long process! I wouldn\u2019t want to go through that again.\u201d Some names have been changed",

The unanimous judgment of the 11 justices, announced by Lady Hale this morning, amounts to a root and branch rejection of the prime minister\u2019s attempts to rule without parliament, to take Britain out of the European Union by 31 October without a deal, and to contrive a premature general election. The judgment was incisive and without any waffle. It was very consciously written in the best tradition of British constitutional law, of which parliamentary sovereignty is the foundational rock.</p> \n<p>The immediate effect of the judgment is devastating for Johnson. It is expressed so cogently and unambiguously that it will be difficult for him to wriggle out of it \u2013 even though he is certainly foolish enough to try. Parliament will surely be recalled on Tuesday \u2013 since, as the judgment said, it has not been prorogued in the first place. Johnson\u2019s efforts, to the extent that they exist at all, to negotiate a new or tweaked deal with the EU will be held up to the light. And, since Johnson spectacularly lacks a majority in the House of Commons, it is likely that the cross-party efforts to shape Brexit will be redoubled.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Pressure on Johnson to quit will surely be central to the way this all plays out in the coming days</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Johnson\u2019s own position as prime minister, along with those of his legal advisers (including the attorney general) and that of his 10 Downing Street advisers (especially his key strategist Dominic Cummings) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/24/time-for-johnson-to-go-readers-on-unlawful-prorogation-ruling\" title=\"\">must also be in question</a>. It is possible that Johnson will throw Cummings to the wolves, to make him the fall guy for the catastrophically inept and illegal strategy that he has been following.</p> \n<p>Pressure on Johnson to quit will surely be central to the way this all plays out in the coming days. His opponents, therefore, absolutely need to agree on the form, composition and, above all, the leader of any government that could replace him. If the court\u2019s ruling means anything for politicians, it is that trying to govern as if you have a majority when in fact you do not is impossible. The belief of the hard-right Tory Brexiters that a party coup against Theresa May in a hung parliament would enable them to get their way by electing Johnson lies shattered. They need to learn the lesson very fast. Militant remainers will have to face the equivalent lesson, too. One notable consequence of the judgment, not to be overlooked in the other excitements, is for the Union. By not overruling the Scottish court of session decision on Johnson\u2019s actions, the supreme court has upheld Scottish judges against English ones, and has removed a potential source of grievance for the SNP against \u201cLondon judges\u201d if the ruling had gone the other way</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/24/brexit-supreme-court-latest-news-labour-conference-starmer-says-it-is-obvious-labour-will-back-remain-despite-conference-vote-live-news\">Brexit: Bercow says parliament must meet 'without delay' as judges rule prorogation unlawful \u2013 live news</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The court\u2019s decision has immense political immediacy. But it is also a landmark ruling in a much wider sense too. After this, it seems inconceivable, save in very restricted circumstances indeed, that prerogative powers of any kind can be exercised in any field without parliamentary authority. The power to prorogue parliament has now followed, in effect, the power to make war and to make treaties. All were once prerogative powers exercised in the past by ministers on behalf of the crown, but without parliamentary scrutiny. That is no longer possible. The process that began in the court of appeal in the 1960s under Lord Reid \u2013 the development of judicial review of public law \u2013 reached its ultimate and triumphant goal this morning.</p> \n<p>Constitutionally, this is a magisterial landmark in the assertion of parliamentary sovereignty against the residual power of the crown and ministers. But it also bolsters parliament against all the other forces that claim to have higher authority too \u2013 from referendums to the tabloid press to the crowds in the streets.</p> \n<p>Whether that is sustainable in an era in which parliament and MPs are held in such low regard, in which the political parties are so fragmented and partisan, and in which the electoral system that creates the sovereign parliament is so slewed in its effects, has to be in doubt. The supreme court did not just sound the trumpet over a failed prime minister. It did the same over a failed constitutional order.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Martin Kettle is a Guardian associate editor and columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "The supreme court has delivered a comprehensive demolition of Boris Johnson\u2019s government and its handling of Brexit. The unanimous judgment of the 11 justices, announced by Lady Hale this morning, amounts to a root and branch rejection of the prime minister\u2019s attempts to rule without parliament, to take Britain out of the European Union by 31 October without a deal, and to contrive a premature general election. The judgment was incisive and without any waffle. It was very consciously written in the best tradition of British constitutional law, of which parliamentary sovereignty is the foundational rock. The immediate effect of the judgment is devastating for Johnson. It is expressed so cogently and unambiguously that it will be difficult for him to wriggle out of it \u2013 even though he is certainly foolish enough to try. Parliament will surely be recalled on Tuesday \u2013 since, as the judgment said, it has not been prorogued in the first place. Johnson\u2019s efforts, to the extent that they exist at all, to negotiate a new or tweaked deal with the EU will be held up to the light. And, since Johnson spectacularly lacks a majority in the House of Commons, it is likely that the cross-party efforts to shape Brexit will be redoubled. Johnson\u2019s own position as prime minister, along with those of his legal advisers (including the attorney general) and that of his 10 Downing Street advisers (especially his key strategist Dominic Cummings) must also be in question. It is possible that Johnson will throw Cummings to the wolves, to make him the fall guy for the catastrophically inept and illegal strategy that he has been following. Pressure on Johnson to quit will surely be central to the way this all plays out in the coming days. His opponents, therefore, absolutely need to agree on the form, composition and, above all, the leader of any government that could replace him. If the court\u2019s ruling means anything for politicians, it is that trying to govern as if you have a majority when in fact you do not is impossible. The belief of the hard-right Tory Brexiters that a party coup against Theresa May in a hung parliament would enable them to get their way by electing Johnson lies shattered. They need to learn the lesson very fast. Militant remainers will have to face the equivalent lesson, too. One notable consequence of the judgment, not to be overlooked in the other excitements, is for the Union. By not overruling the Scottish court of session decision on Johnson\u2019s actions, the supreme court has upheld Scottish judges against English ones, and has removed a potential source of grievance for the SNP against \u201cLondon judges\u201d if the ruling had gone the other way The court\u2019s decision has immense political immediacy. But it is also a landmark ruling in a much wider sense too. After this, it seems inconceivable, save in very restricted circumstances indeed, that prerogative powers of any kind can be exercised in any field without parliamentary authority. The power to prorogue parliament has now followed, in effect, the power to make war and to make treaties. All were once prerogative powers exercised in the past by ministers on behalf of the crown, but without parliamentary scrutiny. That is no longer possible. The process that began in the court of appeal in the 1960s under Lord Reid \u2013 the development of judicial review of public law \u2013 reached its ultimate and triumphant goal this morning. Constitutionally, this is a magisterial landmark in the assertion of parliamentary sovereignty against the residual power of the crown and ministers. But it also bolsters parliament against all the other forces that claim to have higher authority too \u2013 from referendums to the tabloid press to the crowds in the streets. Whether that is sustainable in an era in which parliament and MPs are held in such low regard, in which the political parties are so fragmented and partisan, and in which the electoral system that creates the sovereign parliament is so slewed in its effects, has to be in doubt. The supreme court did not just sound the trumpet over a failed prime minister. It did the same over a failed constitutional order. \u2022 Martin Kettle is a Guardian associate editor and columnist",

While it is correct that the Amba Boys are fighting their own people as well as the government, one is given the impression that the crisis erupted because they wanted to establish their own state of Ambazonia.

Surely there are other, perhaps more interesting, cultural activities to cover. More worryingly, is the Weekly joining other less worthy parts of the media in providing a stream of reports on the royal family, both directly and indirectly, that aid the normalisation of that institution.

When her house in Jesmond (she spent almost her entire life in the suburbs of Newcastle) was bombed, she and her young family had to move in with her mother. This stopped her from producing any more novels. \u201cYou can\u2019t write if you are never alone,\u201d she later told Twycross-Martin.</p> <p>Of course, the fact that she came to speak to Twycross-Martin at all is a good indication of a happy ending.

Sadly, she hadn\u2019t lived long enough to see the Hollywood version of the book that eventually came out in 2008. Then again, I watched it last week and: ugh. In spite of the presence of both Amy Adams and Frances McDormand, and some spectacular art deco interiors, it was agonising. \u201cMcDormand is frankly bland and unresponsive in a role she clearly couldn\u2019t care less about; Adams\u2019s wide-eyed ingenue routine is on autopilot, and the whole thing looks like a sub-prime American TV movie,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/aug/15/romance.comedy\">wrote Peter Bradshaw when the film came out in the UK</a>. He gave it one star. This almost feels generous to a film that mauls this book so cruelly. Gone is the snappy dialogue, the steadily building hilarity of Miss Pettigrew\u2019s growing inebriation, and the sweetness of her being accepted and loved by a total stranger. (In the film, Miss LaFosse actually does think that Miss Pettigrew has come to work for her, thus breaking one of the key bonds in their relationship.)</p> <p>Curiously, the film is also far more prudish: no cocaine, innuendo or fun. It\u2019s quite a contrast with the book \u2013 but that also demonstrates what Wilson did so well. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2019/sep/17/miss-pettigrew-lives-for-a-day-is-charming-but-it-is-also-racist\">Even if it\u2019s flawed and problematic</a> in parts, Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day is also rather wonderful, and deserves such a happy ending.</p>",

I\u2019ve got past all that being excited.\u201d She died two years later. Sadly, she hadn\u2019t lived long enough to see the Hollywood version of the book that eventually came out in 2008. Then again, I watched it last week and: ugh. In spite of the presence of both Amy Adams and Frances McDormand, and some spectacular art deco interiors, it was agonising. \u201cMcDormand is frankly bland and unresponsive in a role she clearly couldn\u2019t care less about; Adams\u2019s wide-eyed ingenue routine is on autopilot, and the whole thing looks like a sub-prime American TV movie,\u201d wrote Peter Bradshaw when the film came out in the UK. He gave it one star. This almost feels generous to a film that mauls this book so cruelly. Gone is the snappy dialogue, the steadily building hilarity of Miss Pettigrew\u2019s growing inebriation, and the sweetness of her being accepted and loved by a total stranger. (In the film, Miss LaFosse actually does think that Miss Pettigrew has come to work for her, thus breaking one of the key bonds in their relationship.) Curiously, the film is also far more prudish: no cocaine, innuendo or fun. It\u2019s quite a contrast with the book \u2013 but that also demonstrates what Wilson did so well. Even if it\u2019s flawed and problematic in parts, Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day is also rather wonderful, and deserves such a happy ending.",

One is to conclude that the entire British honours system is a complete irrelevance, one that has throughout its entire history been incapable of rewarding excellence in team sports, and decide not to be bothered by it; the other is for a decision to be made that sportsmen should never be honoured just for winning stuff. Trophies, medals and public acclaim will just have to do. If an athlete goes on after their retirement to become a brilliant administrator, a tireless fundraiser, a politician\u2019s pal or, for that matter, governor-designate of Bengal they can be honoured then, and for that.

When Len Hutton was knighted in 1956 the Australian spinner Arthur Mailey famously quipped: \u201cI hope next time it\u2019s a bowler \u2013 the last bowler to be knighted was Sir Francis Drake.\u201d Alec Bedser \u2013 who when named a CBE in 1992 sniffed: \u201cA knighthood? They\u2019re for fancy-dan batsmen\u201d \u2013 though he did finally get one four years later \u2013 remains the only English specialist bowler in all of history to be knighted. Jack Hobbs wanted to turn down the knighthood he received in the Queen\u2019s coronation honours but was persuaded not to by Sir Walter Monckton, president of Surrey and a Conservative minister under Winston Churchill. As Hobbs wrote to Herbert Sutcliffe: \u201cI am easier in my mind now, for I realise that it is a compliment not only to myself but to cricket in general and the professional in particular.\u201d The professional batsman, maybe. There only seems to be two possible solutions to all this. One is to conclude that the entire British honours system is a complete irrelevance, one that has throughout its entire history been incapable of rewarding excellence in team sports, and decide not to be bothered by it; the other is for a decision to be made that sportsmen should never be honoured just for winning stuff. Trophies, medals and public acclaim will just have to do. If an athlete goes on after their retirement to become a brilliant administrator, a tireless fundraiser, a politician\u2019s pal or, for that matter, governor-designate of Bengal they can be honoured then, and for that. In the meantime, leave them be. But the crux of the matter is this: sport does not need a complicated and often unreliable system for identifying the outstanding individuals in their disciplines and rewarding them \u2013 it is one. \u2022 This is an extract taken from the Spin, the Guardian\u2019s weekly cricket email.

Trump meets Ukraine accusations with baseless Biden claim Donald Trump has tried to shrug off the growing demands for his impeachment amid allegations that he pressured the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to investigate his potential 2020 rival, Joe Biden, over baseless claims of corruption. Speaking in New York, the president insisted he did not take the threat of impeachment seriously and tried to turn the accusations against him back on his opponents, saying Biden was \u201ccorrupt\u201d and the media \u201ccrooked\u201d. Whistleblower scandal. The House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, has so far resisted calls to begin impeachment proceedings against Trump. Adam Gabbatt explains why the Ukraine scandal may be serious enough to change her mind. Playground taunts. The president\u2019s playground tactic of redirecting accusations of misconduct back at his accusers has proven disappointingly effective in the past, says Tom McCarthy. Trump mocks Greta Thunberg\u2019s emotional climate speech Trump appeared to mock the teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg on Monday, after she made an impassioned speech at the UN climate summit, excoriating world leaders for their \u201cbetrayal\u201d of young people by failing to tackle the climate crisis. Thunberg\u2019s angry address was widely shared, including by the US president, who tweeted: \u201cShe seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!\u201d \u2018You are failing us.\u2019 Thunberg\u2019s criticisms of world leaders looked prescient after Monday\u2019s summit. Trump only fleetingly attended the climate event, China failed to put forward any new climate measures, and Brazil skipped the summit altogether. Missing targets. Just one in five of the world\u2019s largest businesses are expected to to meet the targets agreed in the Paris climate agreement, according to an analysis by the investment data provider Arabesque S-Ray. How the FBI targeted environmental activists More than a dozen environmental activists who campaigned against fossil fuel extraction in North America were identified in domestic terrorism-related investigations by the FBI, according to hundreds of pages of the bureau\u2019s files that were obtained by the Guardian through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit. The investigations were opened in 2013-14, at the height of opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline, and characterised non-violent protesters as a potential threat to national security. Keystone XL pipeline. In 2015, in a victory for campaigners, the Obama administration rejected the Keystone XL pipeline project. The Trump administration has since reversed that decision. Boris Johnson calls for new \u2018Trump deal\u2019 with Iran The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, has hailed Trump as a \u201cvery, very brilliant negotiator\u201d and called on him to forge a new \u201cTrump deal\u201d with Iran, after siding with the US president on the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement, which Johnson described as a \u201cbad deal\u201d.

Proroguing threat. The British supreme court is set to rule on Tuesday as to whether Johnson\u2019s recent suspension of parliament was lawful, but Johnson has nonetheless refused to rule out using the same tactic again. American friend. Johnson\u2019s close friendship with an American businesswoman \u2013 who was granted \u00a3126,000 in public money during his time as London mayor \u2013 is under scrutiny, as Matthew Weaver and Simon Murphy explain. Cheat sheet Airlines in the UK have been accused of ramping up their prices following the collapse of the tour operator Thomas Cook, which left some 150,000 travellers stranded abroad this week. Parents and feminists in China have expressed outrage over the viral popularity of a sexist children\u2019s song by the little-known musician and comedian Yan Lifei, entitled Mommy Don\u2019t Go to Work. A French woman who kept what she believed was a simple old religious icon on her kitchen wall was in fact the unwitting owner of an early Renaissance masterpiece by the Florentine painter Cimabue, which is set to be auctioned for up to $6.5m. Restaurateurs in Berkeley\u2019s so-called \u201cgourmet ghetto\u201d, the home of Alice Waters\u2019 Chez Panisse and the original Peet\u2019s Coffee, are seeking to change the neighbourhood\u2019s nickname over concerns that it is derogatory to marginalised communities. Must-reads America\u2019s staggering immigration detention boom More than 52,000 people are currently confined in US immigration detention centres. Forty years ago, the system didn\u2019t even exist.

Yet as an outsider himself, Burns presents an image of country far more diverse than its stereotype would suggest, says Jonathan Keefe. Opinion Chanel Miller, the victim of the convicted Stanford rapist Brock Turner, has waived her right to anonymity by publishing a memoir and giving her first TV interview. In speaking out, sexual assault survivors can stop the media\u2019s victim-blaming, and shift focus away from the feelings of perpetrators, says Kristine Ziwica. As Miller so powerfully demonstrates, victims who speak out can fundamentally change how we understand sexual assault, the culture that enables it and, most importantly, who should be held accountable. Hint: never the victim.

      "body": "<p>Zero-waste shopping promises to cut down on wasteful packaging and eradicate single-use plastics from the weekly grocery shop. But can we really be weaned off our addiction to the ease and convenience offered by traditional supermarkets, with their pots of chilled products and plastic-wrapped packs of fruit?</p> <p>Jeanette Wong and partner Tom Pell think we can. In June 2018, they opened the <a href=\"https://www.thecleankilo.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Clean Kilo</a>, a zero-waste vegetarian supermarket in Digbeth, Birmingham where shoppers buy in bulk, bringing in their own containers and filling them with everything from rice, pulses and pasta to yoghurt, butter and milk. The idea is to keep packaging to a minimum, so everything is scoopable, pourable and refillable. You can squeeze your own orange juice, get ice-cream in cones and find a selection of fresh fruit and vegetables. There are eco-friendly cleaning products and personal care items. Moisturiser and body wash are sourced locally from nearby Bournville, and the contents of the five-litre containers can be pumped into shoppers\u2019 vessels. Washing up liquid, detergent and cleaners are dispensed from stainless steel containers into customers\u2019 bottles, while laundry and dishwasher powders are scooped into their containers. There\u2019s not a piece of single-use plastic in sight.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cb3681647c2d2db5053261ab38e9cb5eefba620c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb3681647c2d2db5053261ab38e9cb5eefba620c/389_0_5611_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Refill jars in the Clean Kilo, Birmingham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"713\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Refill dispensers in the Clean Kilo, Birmingham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joanne Crawford/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"c57338959956fa52a0b0f1a2e3663ede9790a06b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c57338959956fa52a0b0f1a2e3663ede9790a06b/0_820_4000_5000/800.jpg\" alt=\"Fresh vegetables in the Clean Kilo, Birmingham.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fresh vegetables in the Clean Kilo, Birmingham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joanne Crawford/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"7847f49b67c1da6a7dc764da040309f0e300e9b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7847f49b67c1da6a7dc764da040309f0e300e9b4/0_500_4000_5000/800.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Pell, co-owner of the Clean Kilo, Birmingham\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Pell, co-owner of the Clean Kilo, works the checkout.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joanne Crawford/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Refill dispensers line the walls of the store; fresh vegetables on display; Pell mans on the Clean Kilo\u2019s checkouts.</p></li> </ul> <p>\u201cThe system is complex, it\u2019s difficult to manage \u2013 it takes more time, so it\u2019s not as cost-effective as a traditional supermarket. But that\u2019s the only way we\u2019re going to combat using single-use plastics,\u201d says Pell. He estimates the store has saved on more than 150,000 pieces of single-use plastic since opening.</p> <p>Shopping at the Clean Kilo offers novelty and fun, with shoppers measuring out their groceries and weighing them on scales.

      "bodyText": "Zero-waste shopping promises to cut down on wasteful packaging and eradicate single-use plastics from the weekly grocery shop. But can we really be weaned off our addiction to the ease and convenience offered by traditional supermarkets, with their pots of chilled products and plastic-wrapped packs of fruit? Jeanette Wong and partner Tom Pell think we can. In June 2018, they opened the Clean Kilo, a zero-waste vegetarian supermarket in Digbeth, Birmingham where shoppers buy in bulk, bringing in their own containers and filling them with everything from rice, pulses and pasta to yoghurt, butter and milk. The idea is to keep packaging to a minimum, so everything is scoopable, pourable and refillable. You can squeeze your own orange juice, get ice-cream in cones and find a selection of fresh fruit and vegetables. There are eco-friendly cleaning products and personal care items. Moisturiser and body wash are sourced locally from nearby Bournville, and the contents of the five-litre containers can be pumped into shoppers\u2019 vessels. Washing up liquid, detergent and cleaners are dispensed from stainless steel containers into customers\u2019 bottles, while laundry and dishwasher powders are scooped into their containers. There\u2019s not a piece of single-use plastic in sight. Refill dispensers line the walls of the store; fresh vegetables on display; Pell mans on the Clean Kilo\u2019s checkouts. \u201cThe system is complex, it\u2019s difficult to manage \u2013 it takes more time, so it\u2019s not as cost-effective as a traditional supermarket. But that\u2019s the only way we\u2019re going to combat using single-use plastics,\u201d says Pell. He estimates the store has saved on more than 150,000 pieces of single-use plastic since opening. Shopping at the Clean Kilo offers novelty and fun, with shoppers measuring out their groceries and weighing them on scales. Serving some 80 shoppers a day, the store attracts those who are committed to doing their bit for the environment. \u201cIt\u2019s been really rewarding seeing customers come in with bags of reused containers, old shampoo bottles, cleaning product bottles and Tupperware, and they\u2019ve made an effort to clean them,\u201d says Wong. \u201cCustomers come in from places like Edgbaston, which is a 45-minute walk \u2013 people are really committed.\u201d The store has a hygiene policy that is advertised throughout, asking shoppers to make sure their containers are clean. Most products are dry, reducing the chances of bacterial infection. Butter, milk and yoghurt are served by staff who can check with customers that containers are clean. The pair hit on the idea for a zero-waste supermarket in 2017 after watching A Plastic Ocean, which highlighted the damage done to our waters by plastic pollution. Though Wong and Pell save on packaging, the style of retailing at the Clean Kilo incurs other expenses due to the labour intensive nature of rotating products, refilling dispensers and helping to introduce customers to a new way of shopping. \u201cPeople were aware of the problem \u2013 but not to the extent that we are now. We were talking about how we could reduce plastic in our own lives because these days it\u2019s very difficult, as everything is surrounded by single-use plastic and there are so many convenience items,\u201d says Wong.

No-plastic people: paper is the only option when it comes to disposable packaging at the Clean Kilo. Even though packaging can account for a fifth of the cost of a product, the style of retailing at the Clean Kilo incurs other expenses, as it requires greater staff involvement.

Eighty percent of the company\u2019s packaging is recyclable and 10% of European consumer product packaging is made from recycled plastic, with a target of 35% by 2025. The fact that its Right Guard shower gel bottles are made of 30% recycled PET also creates annual savings of about 200 metric tonnes of new PET material.</p> <p>\u201cWhenever we develop new packaging it needs to be more sustainable,\u201d says Thorsten Leopold, head of international packaging development for home care at Henkel. \u201cAnd the best thing you can do is always to reduce the amount of material.\u201d</p> <p>Packaging engineers, working closely with partner organisations, have also managed to overcome some of the barriers to recycling found in certain categories of packaging, such as multi-layer packs, black plastic and product sleeves.

It\u2019s important that consumers remove this sleeve so the bottle can be sorted properly at the recycling facility, so Henkel added a perforated seam to aid the process.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d5616b9361df889c5d3aaf401ae92bca2525e46f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d5616b9361df889c5d3aaf401ae92bca2525e46f/0_886_3545_4429/800.jpg\" alt=\"Henkel Headquarter, Thorsten Leopold, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany, 2019-09-13\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thorsten Leopold.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carsten Behler</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Flexible packaging, meanwhile, is made of multiple layers of film and foil bonded together, which are difficult to separate during the recycling process. Henkel is helping to change this through its membership of CEFLEX, a consortium of approximately 50 European companies and organisations that want to make flexible packaging easier to separate and recycle. Together with German startup Saperatec, it\u2019s also developing a technology that can be used to split the layers of flexible packaging and make the resulting material available for recycling.</p> <p>Of course, one company can\u2019t change the entire packaging and recycling system on its own, which is why Henkel is a member of initiatives such as the New Plastics Economy and the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, which bring together government, business and NGOs to tackle plastic waste and create a circular economy for the material. It also works closely with Plastic Bank, a social enterprise that turns plastic waste into money, goods and services for some of the poorest people in the world. And it aims to provide information on recycling and reuse to more than 1 billion consumers via its packaging and initiatives such as Henkel Beauty Care\u2019s \u201cBe smarter. Recycle\u201d campaign.</p> <p>Sustainability is a much wider issue than plastics and packaging. In 2011, Henkel was one of a group of companies from the chemical industry that established Together for Sustainability (TfS), which aims to develop and implement a global programme to assess, audit and improve circularity practices within the supply chains of the chemical industry. Gabriele Unger, general manager of TfS, says the market leaders in terms of sustainable chemical value chains have a deep understanding of the need to track not only their own sustainability performance, but also that of their vast pool of suppliers.</p> <p>As a member of TfS, Henkel\u2019s sustainability management was analysed by international rating agency EcoVadis in 2018 and found to be <a href=\"https://www.henkel.com/press-and-media/press-releases-and-kits/2018-09-06-henkel-again-among-global-leaders-in-sustainability-875066\" rel=\"nofollow\">among the top 1%</a> of the most sustainable companies worldwide. That\u2019s no doubt down to the fact that Henkel believes improved sustainability and business performance go hand in hand.</p> <p>It\u2019s a belief shared by Mar\u00eda Mendiluce, managing director for climate change and energy, cities &amp; mobility and circular economy at the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, a global, CEO-led organisation of more than 200 leading businesses and partners working together to accelerate the transition to a sustainable world. \u201cWhile sustainability is of course \u2018the right thing to do\u2019 for people and the planet, it is also the strategy that will deliver the best outcomes for the business,\u201d she says. \u201cEvery business wants to be long-lasting, and sustainability is a way to help ensure that.\u201d In other words, you could say their \u2013 and our \u2013 future depends upon it.</p> <p><em>Find out more about Henkel\u2019s sustainability strategy by visiting: <a href=\"https://www.henkel.co.uk/sustainability\" rel=\"nofollow\">henkel.co.uk/sustainability</a></em></p>",

Henkel is helping to change this through its membership of CEFLEX, a consortium of approximately 50 European companies and organisations that want to make flexible packaging easier to separate and recycle. Together with German startup Saperatec, it\u2019s also developing a technology that can be used to split the layers of flexible packaging and make the resulting material available for recycling. Of course, one company can\u2019t change the entire packaging and recycling system on its own, which is why Henkel is a member of initiatives such as the New Plastics Economy and the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, which bring together government, business and NGOs to tackle plastic waste and create a circular economy for the material. It also works closely with Plastic Bank, a social enterprise that turns plastic waste into money, goods and services for some of the poorest people in the world. And it aims to provide information on recycling and reuse to more than 1 billion consumers via its packaging and initiatives such as Henkel Beauty Care\u2019s \u201cBe smarter. Recycle\u201d campaign. Sustainability is a much wider issue than plastics and packaging. In 2011, Henkel was one of a group of companies from the chemical industry that established Together for Sustainability (TfS), which aims to develop and implement a global programme to assess, audit and improve circularity practices within the supply chains of the chemical industry. Gabriele Unger, general manager of TfS, says the market leaders in terms of sustainable chemical value chains have a deep understanding of the need to track not only their own sustainability performance, but also that of their vast pool of suppliers. As a member of TfS, Henkel\u2019s sustainability management was analysed by international rating agency EcoVadis in 2018 and found to be among the top 1% of the most sustainable companies worldwide. That\u2019s no doubt down to the fact that Henkel believes improved sustainability and business performance go hand in hand. It\u2019s a belief shared by Mar\u00eda Mendiluce, managing director for climate change and energy, cities &amp; mobility and circular economy at the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, a global, CEO-led organisation of more than 200 leading businesses and partners working together to accelerate the transition to a sustainable world. \u201cWhile sustainability is of course \u2018the right thing to do\u2019 for people and the planet, it is also the strategy that will deliver the best outcomes for the business,\u201d she says. \u201cEvery business wants to be long-lasting, and sustainability is a way to help ensure that.\u201d In other words, you could say their \u2013 and our \u2013 future depends upon it.

It has managed the facility, which holds up to 508 adult men, since it opened in 2009 under a Home Office contract. The contract was due to end in 2018 but was temporarily extended until May 2020. It was reported that Serco was believed to be a front-runner to take over. Tinsley House, which is also near Gatwick airport and is much smaller, has been comparatively scandal-free. However, an HMIP report last year said detainees claimed staff had threatened to have them transferred to the neighbouring facility as a punishment. A large majority of the UK\u2019s immigration removal centres are run by private companies, and the sector has expanded in recent years amid the effort to create a \u201chostile environment\u201d for migrants. In August, G4S \u2013 which refers to itself as the largest secure outsourcing company in the UK and Ireland \u2013 also stopped operating accommodation for asylum seekers in the Midlands, north-east England and Northern Ireland, after being overlooked in the tendering process. It said in a statement: \u201cG4S will not seek to renew the contract to run Gatwick\u2019s immigration removal centres, Brook House and Tinsley House. This will allow us to give greater focus to our custody and rehabilitation business, where we operate four of the highest rated prisons in England and Wales.\u201d",

That\u2019s how Steve Martin and Martin Short are described \u2013 much to their embarrassment \u2013 in the publicity for their UK comedy tour, announced on Monday. I\u2019ve got them both on the phone from Dallas, Texas, on the morning of their latest gig, to discuss this late-career double act and UK visit. From 5,000 miles away, they hype up the Guardian, banter and backchat, punctuated by incongruous blasts on the banjo from Martin, aka one-sixth of bluegrass band <a href=\"https://www.steepcanyon.com/\">Steep Canyon Rangers</a>, who tour with the show.</p> <p>The pair have been close friends since co-starring in The Three Amigos (with Chevy Chase) in 1986. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through a lot together,\u201d says Martin: \u201cMarriage, deaths, births and divorces.\u201d It was shortly after the death of Short\u2019s wife, Nancy Dolman, and before the birth of Martin\u2019s first child (he was 67 at the time), that they were asked to interview one another on stage at the Chicago comedy festival. \u201cIt went really well,\u201d says Martin, \u201cand we said, \u2018Let\u2019s do it again, that was fun.\u2019 And the more we did it, the more we thought, \u2018We need a real show, we can\u2019t just sit there and talk.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>So they came up with one, then were Emmy-nominated for its Netflix incarnation, entitled <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQlpjJ-hA0Q\">An Evening You Will Forget for the Rest of Your Life</a>. The actor (and Short\u2019s pal) Catherine O\u2019Hara described it as \u201ca children\u2019s show for adults\u201d, while others reached for the term vaudeville \u2013 which mystifies Martin and Short. \u201cI\u2019ve never quite understood what vaudeville means,\u201d says the latter, \u201cexcept that it\u2019s a quick succession of different acts. Which describes our show, I guess \u2013 because Steve and I do stuff together, then I do stuff alone, then Steve does, then he plays the banjo and we have this brilliant band come on.\u201d The term also reflects the old-school nature of the pair\u2019s relationship: their quick back-and-forth, the playful spirit of one-upmanship, the teasing that doesn\u2019t even pretend to conceal their fond camaraderie.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5dc7ebbb4f803c79704919b8befe82e646e63bac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5dc7ebbb4f803c79704919b8befe82e646e63bac/0_0_2744_1839/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steve Martin, Martin Short and Chevy Chase in Three Amigos!\" width=\"1000\" height=\"670\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We\u2019ve been through a lot together\u2019 \u2026 Steve Martin, Martin Short and Chevy Chase in Three Amigos!</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Orion Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019re absolutely a double act,\u201d says Short.

Yes, admits Short: \u201cIf you\u2019ve been in the movies when someone was 12 or 13, and now they\u2019re 40 and seeing your show, there\u2019s a nice feeling to that. It feels like you\u2019ve been part of their life.\u201d But the duo aren\u2019t resting on laurels, says Martin. \u201cI like to think of this as hopefully among the funniest shows the audience has ever seen.

I waved my phone with the digital ticket at the man on the barrier and jogged to the carriage.</p> <p>A sense of relief swept over me. I could see an empty table farther down. I took one of the window seats, unpacked my computer, and exhaled as the doors closed and we drifted away. For the past 30 years, I have opted to travel by train rather than fly.</p> <p>My love affair with rail began early. My granny used to take my brother and I on holidays by train every summer. We would walk to her local station in Fishbourne in West Sussex with our small suitcases, get picked up by one of the old local slam-door trains, and then range wherever we wanted across the country.</p> <p>Whether we ended up in seaside hotels on the south coast in Bournemouth or Brighton, or went to visit our numerous great uncles and aunts in Lincolnshire via London, the magic always began long before we reached our destination.</p> <p>I remember especially fondly the feeling as a young boy of pound coins sweating in my hands while I bravely made my way to the restaurant car. Returning with bags of goodies on my way back to our seats.</p> <p>Back in the present, I looked up from my laptop and stared out the window as the countryside unfurled beside me.

      "bodyText": "Walking briskly towards Salisbury station, I double checked the Trainline app on my phone for my departure time. I would make it. Just. I waved my phone with the digital ticket at the man on the barrier and jogged to the carriage. A sense of relief swept over me. I could see an empty table farther down. I took one of the window seats, unpacked my computer, and exhaled as the doors closed and we drifted away. For the past 30 years, I have opted to travel by train rather than fly. My love affair with rail began early. My granny used to take my brother and I on holidays by train every summer. We would walk to her local station in Fishbourne in West Sussex with our small suitcases, get picked up by one of the old local slam-door trains, and then range wherever we wanted across the country. Whether we ended up in seaside hotels on the south coast in Bournemouth or Brighton, or went to visit our numerous great uncles and aunts in Lincolnshire via London, the magic always began long before we reached our destination. I remember especially fondly the feeling as a young boy of pound coins sweating in my hands while I bravely made my way to the restaurant car. Returning with bags of goodies on my way back to our seats. Back in the present, I looked up from my laptop and stared out the window as the countryside unfurled beside me. I felt a familiar comfort from the landscape, just looking at it through the window always calms me. It gives my eyes something to occupy themselves with while thoughts unspool in my mind. I was on the train to write because I was after the way it feels to be on a train just as much as where it happened to be taking me. Trains have always been multipurpose for me, you see.

      "body": "<p>The Nurse With Wound list is one of the greatest pieces of fieldwork ever conducted in music. It is a secret handshake, a map, a wishlist, and yet it still contains mysteries. A list of 291 artists, many of them unknown and unknowable pre-internet, was included in the 1979 debut album by the industrial group Nurse With Wound. Now 40 years old and legendary in underground circles, the label Finders Keepers are undertaking the Sisyphean task of collecting and compiling one track by every artist on it.</p> <p>Nurse With Wound were associated with industrial music from its inception, although they were more interested in a surrealist sonic bricolage than the brutalism and didactic politics of their peers. While the group is now just Steven Stapleton, when the list was written it also featured John Fothergill and Heman Pathak. Along with studio engineer Nicky Rogers on guitar, their debut <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chance_Meeting_on_a_Dissecting_Table_of_a_Sewing_Machine_and_an_Umbrella\">Chance Meeting on a Dissecting Table of a Sewing Machine and an Umbrella</a> was pressed in an edition of 500 after being recorded in six hours; Fothergill had owned a guitar for four days. Stapleton says they didn\u2019t expect to sell any \u2013 his cover art depicts a woman with whip and gimp mask, large breasts spilling from a full-body rubber suit. Unsurprisingly, some shops wouldn\u2019t stock it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7da32502e4f07b4d88eba0fb1220bfb164333af2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7da32502e4f07b4d88eba0fb1220bfb164333af2/0_0_604_445/500.jpg\" alt=\"French prog band Mahjun.\" width=\"500\" height=\"368\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">French prog band Mahjun.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Finders Keepers</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Inspired by the cover art on a German free jazz album by Wolfgang Dauner, which named all his inspirations and influences, the NWW list, included in the sleevenotes, was a cacophony of radical mind-altering music that Stapleton says had \u201cbroken barriers and been outlandish, or was completely and utterly original,\u201d a map of their discoveries in European outsider music, one drawn as that music was being made. \u201cWe honed it down and put it in,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then nobody gave a shit, basically\u201d.</p> <p>Going back to the records he loved for the Finder\u2019s Keepers compilation, he says he is still blown away by how fresh all this music sounds, and is getting reacquainted with records he used to know by heart. \u201cThat period was just so fertile,\u201d he enthuses. \u201cIt\u2019s not really nostalgia for me, it\u2019s more like revisiting old friends.\u201d</p> <p>The list is krautrock heavy, with French prog, British improv, outr\u00e9 Italian pop, post-punk, noise music, and stuff that doesn\u2019t easily fit anywhere, such as the mind-blowing vocal cut-ups and collages of Gh\u00e9dalia Tazart\u00e8s, or the rapturous jams of Japanese performance group Tokyo Kid Brothers. The NWW list contains irresistible band names such as Horrific Child, Lard Free, and Ovary Lodge, alongside legends like Yoko Ono and Frank Zappa. Stapleton once said some of the names didn\u2019t exist, although Fothergill disputes this. In fact, Stapleton admits they\u2019re both right, as one of the groups (he won\u2019t tell me which) never recorded or released anything bar one track, so whether they existed is debatable.</p> <p>Go deep enough, and the stories behind these groups, whether legendary or forgotten, are wormholes in themselves. A psych jam by the Yo Ha Wha 13 will lead you to the story of a free love cult that invented organic eating.

      "bodyText": "The Nurse With Wound list is one of the greatest pieces of fieldwork ever conducted in music. It is a secret handshake, a map, a wishlist, and yet it still contains mysteries. A list of 291 artists, many of them unknown and unknowable pre-internet, was included in the 1979 debut album by the industrial group Nurse With Wound. Now 40 years old and legendary in underground circles, the label Finders Keepers are undertaking the Sisyphean task of collecting and compiling one track by every artist on it. Nurse With Wound were associated with industrial music from its inception, although they were more interested in a surrealist sonic bricolage than the brutalism and didactic politics of their peers. While the group is now just Steven Stapleton, when the list was written it also featured John Fothergill and Heman Pathak. Along with studio engineer Nicky Rogers on guitar, their debut Chance Meeting on a Dissecting Table of a Sewing Machine and an Umbrella was pressed in an edition of 500 after being recorded in six hours; Fothergill had owned a guitar for four days. Stapleton says they didn\u2019t expect to sell any \u2013 his cover art depicts a woman with whip and gimp mask, large breasts spilling from a full-body rubber suit. Unsurprisingly, some shops wouldn\u2019t stock it. Inspired by the cover art on a German free jazz album by Wolfgang Dauner, which named all his inspirations and influences, the NWW list, included in the sleevenotes, was a cacophony of radical mind-altering music that Stapleton says had \u201cbroken barriers and been outlandish, or was completely and utterly original,\u201d a map of their discoveries in European outsider music, one drawn as that music was being made. \u201cWe honed it down and put it in,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then nobody gave a shit, basically\u201d. Going back to the records he loved for the Finder\u2019s Keepers compilation, he says he is still blown away by how fresh all this music sounds, and is getting reacquainted with records he used to know by heart. \u201cThat period was just so fertile,\u201d he enthuses. \u201cIt\u2019s not really nostalgia for me, it\u2019s more like revisiting old friends.\u201d The list is krautrock heavy, with French prog, British improv, outr\u00e9 Italian pop, post-punk, noise music, and stuff that doesn\u2019t easily fit anywhere, such as the mind-blowing vocal cut-ups and collages of Gh\u00e9dalia Tazart\u00e8s, or the rapturous jams of Japanese performance group Tokyo Kid Brothers. The NWW list contains irresistible band names such as Horrific Child, Lard Free, and Ovary Lodge, alongside legends like Yoko Ono and Frank Zappa. Stapleton once said some of the names didn\u2019t exist, although Fothergill disputes this. In fact, Stapleton admits they\u2019re both right, as one of the groups (he won\u2019t tell me which) never recorded or released anything bar one track, so whether they existed is debatable. Go deep enough, and the stories behind these groups, whether legendary or forgotten, are wormholes in themselves. A psych jam by the Yo Ha Wha 13 will lead you to the story of a free love cult that invented organic eating. Dig around the British improv entries and you\u2019ll eventually find an album by TV comedian Vic Reeves. Dutch drummer Han Bennink (still very active) has been known to play drum kits made of cheese. You\u2019ll hear Pierre Henry, who inspired the Futurama theme; the French Nico in Catherine Ribeiro; the French Ella Fitzgerald in Colette Magny; and Alvaro, dubbed \u201cthe Chilean with the singing nose\u201d, an exile from the Pinochet regime who played with Joe Strummer. When the list was written, Stapleton, Pathak and Fothergill were already well schooled in the art of digging at home and abroad, scouring the racks for anything unusual. \u201cEvery tiny snippet of information you could find back then was really important,\u201d explains Stapleton.

On appeal, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jun/26/uber-case-licence-london\">Uber was granted a 15-month provisional licence</a>.</p> <p>TfL said its initial decision not to licence Uber had led the firm to improve its culture and governance.</p> <p>A TfL spokesperson said: \u201cUber London Ltd has been granted a two-month private hire operator licence to allow for scrutiny of additional information that we are requesting ahead of consideration of any potential further licensing application.\u201d</p> <p>The two-month licence will have additional conditions attached to ensure passenger safety, covering ride-sharing, insurance and checks on driver\u2019s documentation by Uber.</p> <p>The terms of the 15-month licence granted by magistrates last year will continue to apply, obliging Uber to produce an independently verified assurance report every six months, elect three non-executive directors to its board, give TfL four weeks\u2019 notice of any changes to its operate model, and to report any potentially criminal complaints from passengers to the Metropolitan police.</p> <p>In July this year Uber was fined \u00a328,800 for two counts of its drivers operating without insurance and for failing to keep proper records.</p> <p>Uber said it had made progress, including more checks on driver hours and additional safety measures for passengers. Jamie Heywood, Uber\u2019s regional general manager for northern and eastern Europe, said: \u201cTfL\u2019s recognition of our improved culture and governance reflects the progress we have made in London. We will continue to work closely with TfL and provide any additional requested information.</p> <p>\u201cOver the past two years, we\u2019ve launched a range of new safety features in the app, introduced better protections for drivers and our clean air plan is helping to tackle air pollution.</p> <p>\u201cWe will keep listening, learning and improving to provide the best service while being a trusted partner to London.\u201d</p> <p>Black cab drivers said the ruling showed Uber should not be trusted by Londoners. Steve McNamara, the general secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers\u2019 Association, said: \u201cGranting Uber a two-month temporary licence clearly shows that the firm have failed their probation and are still a huge threat to public safety.</p> <p>\u201cOver the last 15 months Uber was supposed to change its operations for the better, but the firm has continued to shirk its responsibilities. The granting of the shortest operator\u2019s licence ever shows the mayor doesn\u2019t trust Uber, and neither should Londoners.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Business email signup\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s time the mayor pulled the plug on Uber\u2019s immoral operation for good.\u201d</p> <p>The GMB union, which represents minicab drivers, said Uber had had \u201cmore chances than a game of Monopoly\u201d. Steve Garelick, regional officer, criticised the decision: \u201cA two-month licence extension is no good for anyone \u2013 it leaves uncertainty for drivers and passengers, meanwhile Uber still operates an unsafe model on the streets of London.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, said he backed TfL\u2019s decision. He said: \u201cSadiq has been crystal clear that in London it doesn\u2019t matter how powerful and how big you are, you must play by the rules.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Uber\u2019s application to renew its private hire operating licence in London has been rebuffed again by regulators. Transport for London has instead given the ride-hailing firm only a two-month extension to its licence, which is due to expire on Wednesday night. It is the second time in two years that TfL has rejected Uber\u2019s application for a full operating licence. In September 2017, at the end if its first five-year licensing period, TfL said Uber was not a \u201cfit and proper\u201d firm, citing concerns including passenger safety. On appeal, Uber was granted a 15-month provisional licence. TfL said its initial decision not to licence Uber had led the firm to improve its culture and governance. A TfL spokesperson said: \u201cUber London Ltd has been granted a two-month private hire operator licence to allow for scrutiny of additional information that we are requesting ahead of consideration of any potential further licensing application.\u201d The two-month licence will have additional conditions attached to ensure passenger safety, covering ride-sharing, insurance and checks on driver\u2019s documentation by Uber. The terms of the 15-month licence granted by magistrates last year will continue to apply, obliging Uber to produce an independently verified assurance report every six months, elect three non-executive directors to its board, give TfL four weeks\u2019 notice of any changes to its operate model, and to report any potentially criminal complaints from passengers to the Metropolitan police. In July this year Uber was fined \u00a328,800 for two counts of its drivers operating without insurance and for failing to keep proper records. Uber said it had made progress, including more checks on driver hours and additional safety measures for passengers. Jamie Heywood, Uber\u2019s regional general manager for northern and eastern Europe, said: \u201cTfL\u2019s recognition of our improved culture and governance reflects the progress we have made in London. We will continue to work closely with TfL and provide any additional requested information. \u201cOver the past two years, we\u2019ve launched a range of new safety features in the app, introduced better protections for drivers and our clean air plan is helping to tackle air pollution. \u201cWe will keep listening, learning and improving to provide the best service while being a trusted partner to London.\u201d Black cab drivers said the ruling showed Uber should not be trusted by Londoners. Steve McNamara, the general secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers\u2019 Association, said: \u201cGranting Uber a two-month temporary licence clearly shows that the firm have failed their probation and are still a huge threat to public safety. \u201cOver the last 15 months Uber was supposed to change its operations for the better, but the firm has continued to shirk its responsibilities. The granting of the shortest operator\u2019s licence ever shows the mayor doesn\u2019t trust Uber, and neither should Londoners. \u201cIt\u2019s time the mayor pulled the plug on Uber\u2019s immoral operation for good.\u201d The GMB union, which represents minicab drivers, said Uber had had \u201cmore chances than a game of Monopoly\u201d. Steve Garelick, regional officer, criticised the decision: \u201cA two-month licence extension is no good for anyone \u2013 it leaves uncertainty for drivers and passengers, meanwhile Uber still operates an unsafe model on the streets of London.\u201d A spokesman for the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, said he backed TfL\u2019s decision. He said: \u201cSadiq has been crystal clear that in London it doesn\u2019t matter how powerful and how big you are, you must play by the rules.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, has said he is disappointed Labour members rejected efforts to make the party one that formally backs remain and has \u201cmixed feelings\u201d on Jeremy Corbyn staying neutral on the issue. His remarks come as concerns continue over the way a vote to determine the party\u2019s stance on Brexit was held at Labour\u2019s party conference in Brighton. The close-run vote among delegates was orchestrated through a show of hands rather than a card vote, which some members feel would have given a more accurate result. Speaking to the political website Politico, Starmer said: \u201cI have said for some time, over and over again, that I would campaign for remain, so obviously I am disappointed by the result. But we had a vote \u2013 that is what the Labour party does.\u201d The former director of public prosecutions said he believed Labour voters wanted the party to campaign for remain should there be another referendum, adding it was \u201cobvious\u201d where the membership was on the issue. Corbyn\u2019s decision to avoid personally giving a judgment on Brexit during an expected general election campaign was also criticised by his shadow cabinet colleague. \u201cI have got mixed feelings about that. I personally think it is far better to say campaign to remain, and that is what I have said \u2026 I don\u2019t think there is a deal that is going to be as good as the deal we have got.\u201d His colleague and former foreign secretary Margaret Beckett, a remain campaigner, suggested to Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that the vote in conference to decide on the party\u2019s Brexit stance had been confusing and muddled. The chair of Labour\u2019s ruling body, the national executive committee (NEC), Wendy Nichols, told delegates she thought the vote had gone one way while suggesting the general secretary, Jennie Formby, who was sitting next to her, \u201csaid something else\u201d. She then announced that the \u201cback remain now\u201d motion had lost. Beckett said: \u201cI thought the vote was quite close and the process seemed a little bit muddled from the perspective of somebody who wasn\u2019t on the stage and that\u2019s a pity because that always adds to confusion.\u201d The chances are the result will be challenged, she added. She said: \u201cOne of the features of a Labour party conference over the years is whatever happens is likely to be challenged by somebody.

When screening potential interns, use diverse hiring panels, remove gender-biased interview questions, and actively report diversity and inclusion for hiring. When interns are on site, don\u2019t allow your commitment to promoting a culture of gender-equality slide. Continued mentorship opportunities during internship experiences are also undervalued.\u201d</p> <p>Increasingly, companies are opting for sponsored education programmes in place of internships. Code First: Girls is partnering with a number of companies to co-create and deliver bespoke, company-accredited coding programmes for women. This, Brailsford says, offers companies the opportunity to invest in women from a wide variety of backgrounds, \u201cnot just those that have taken a coveted computer science degree\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cOne common problem all women in tech face is peers treating women as if they\u2019re not as knowledgeable or experienced as male colleagues,\u201d says Lauren Allison, CEO of online course provider #techmums, \u201cand I\u2019m sure that is compounded for women in learning positions such as placements or internships.\u201d</p> <p>She adds: \u201cIt\u2019s appalling that it\u2019s 2019 and the small changes in statistics are seen as the situation \u2018getting better\u2019.

She\u2019s in the third year of her PhD and is interning in the audio team at BBC Research &amp; Development at MediaCityUK in Salford. \u201cThe industry is still male dominated, but the fact that my PhD student cohort is currently female dominated indicates it might be shifting,\u201d she says. \u201cFrom the different organisations I\u2019ve worked for, I\u2019ve seen that a lot of the things necessary to support all different types of people pursuing a technical career are already in place, such as flexible working, a focus on good mental health in the workplace, and establishing good work-life balance.\u201d</p> <p>Caruso says companies and individuals who follow this advice will reap the benefits: \u201cA community of women who feel supported and treated fairly is the most effective PR tool to inspire future women in tech.\u201d</p>",

She\u2019s in the third year of her PhD and is interning in the audio team at BBC Research &amp; Development at MediaCityUK in Salford. \u201cThe industry is still male dominated, but the fact that my PhD student cohort is currently female dominated indicates it might be shifting,\u201d she says. \u201cFrom the different organisations I\u2019ve worked for, I\u2019ve seen that a lot of the things necessary to support all different types of people pursuing a technical career are already in place, such as flexible working, a focus on good mental health in the workplace, and establishing good work-life balance.\u201d Caruso says companies and individuals who follow this advice will reap the benefits: \u201cA community of women who feel supported and treated fairly is the most effective PR tool to inspire future women in tech.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "\ufeffOut campaigning for Canada\u2019s Green party ahead of next month\u2019s federal election, Steve Dyck knows history is stacked against him. He\u2019s a first-time candidate up against an incumbent MP in an electoral district of Guelph, Ontario, that has been held by Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberal party for nearly 30 years. But Dyck sees glimmers of hope. Canvassing one recent summer evening, he spots a vehicle pulling out from a nearby driveway and dashes over. Before Dyck can recite his stump speech, the driver cuts him off. \u201cHey man, you\u2019ve got my vote,\u201d says Matthew Bailey, rolling down the window of his minivan. Until recently, such a scene \u2013 a Green party candidate making inroads in the country\u2019s most populous province \u2013 would have been inconceivable. For many years, the Greens were dismissed as a fringe outfit, with just one federal MP \u2013 the party\u2019s leader Elizabeth May, who has sat in parliament since 2011. But growing fears over the impact of the climate crisis and dissatisfaction with establishment parties have left many voters weary of politics-as-usual. The Liberal government\u2019s efforts to claim the environmental high ground has been undercut by its decision to buy a controversial oil pipeline to make sure construction is completed \u2013 despite opposition by Indigenous communities and scientists. And Justin Trudeau\u2019s own brand has been tarnished \u2013 first by a conflict-of-interests scandal and then by the emergence of three images of him in blackface. In contrast, the Greens have experienced a pre-election surge in popularity: for the first time in Canadian history, they have become the official opposition in one province (Prince Edward Island). And in late spring, the Greens won a federal by-election, stealing the seat from the leftwing New Democratic party and doubling their seats in parliament. That still leaves the party well short of the 12 seats required for official party status in parliament, and popular support for the Greens averages at around 9%. But against all odds, May has reason to feel buoyant. She consistently polled as the most trusted federal party leader, Green membership has never been higher and the party is breaking fundraising records. And polls suggest that her party is set to gain more seats in this election. \u201cThe public support feels very different. It\u2019s palpable. It\u2019s tangible,\u201d May told the Guardian. After years of effort, her party\u2019s focus on a mounting environmental crisis has resonated with voters across the political spectrum. \u201cConservatives are not immune to concerns about their grandchildren,\u201d she said. Across the country, polling suggests the Greens have a legitimate shot of doubling or tripling their presence in parliament, running competitive races in British Columbia, Atlantic Canada and Ontario. And in Guelph, a college town of nearly 150,000 hemmed in by farmland, May believes the Dyck is \u201cvery, very likely\u201d to emerge victorious on election day. But the Greens are also focused on using the election as a way of shedding their image of a single-issue issue party, instead recruiting candidates from a broad range of ideological perspectives: ardent environmentalists, libertarian-leaning thinkers and fiscal conservatives. \u201cWe were the first party to call for equal marriage. We were the first party to call for legalization of cannabis. We were the first party to call for getting rid of \u2018first-pass-the post\u2019 voting. There\u2019s a long list,\u201d said May. In some ways, Dyck represents the archetype of a \u201cgreen\u201d candidate running for public office: he drives an electric car, drinks a roasted barley beverage and wears a sturdy pair of hiking shoes while canvassing the city\u2019s south end. But he also comes from a farming town in Alberta, where his family works in the oil and gas industry. And when speaking with potential voters, he lights up about capital gains tax and zero-interest loans \u2013 two policies in the recently released party platform. The manifesto includes the standard fare of Green promises: reducing the country\u2019s emissions, electrifying cars and bolstering environmental protections. But it also calls for Canada to resettle climate refugees, rely more heavily on domestic Canadian oil production instead of imports, decriminalize all drugs and promise free post-secondary education. On the doorsteps and sidewalks of Guelph, it\u2019s clear that not everyone is a Green voter in waiting. Some locals tell Dyck they\u2019re not interested in politics; others listen politely, but tell him they\u2019re skeptical of the party\u2019s chances across the country. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard to ask Canadians to vote for someone who\u2019s probably not going win,\u201d said Lori Turnbull, a professor of political science at Dalhousie University. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what the Greens are asking.\u201d But even a small number of seats would matter: recent polling show both the Liberals and the opposition Conservatives falling short of a majority. The Greens have the potential to hold the balance of power in a minority government\u2013 and a chance to bring Green policy proposals to the negotiating table. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in a balance of power in order to have power for the Green party,\u201d said May. \u201cWhat I\u2019m interested in, is the balance of responsibility \u2026 We will not support any government that has not put together a persuasive \u2013 and convincing \u2013 plan for real climate action.\u201d With increased attention, however, comes increased scrutiny.

Even May prompted a flurry of questions after she told reporters wouldn\u2019t whip party votes to block a Green candidate from tabling anti-abortion legislation \u2013 although she insists that she is firmly in favour of a woman\u2019s right to choose. \u201cI\u2019ve never made any statements about the abortion issue at any time in my life \u2013never retreating one inch \u2013 from a woman\u2019s rights to legal abortion. Ever,\u201d she said. But the increased scrutiny the party reflects the belief \u2013 among voters and analysts \u2013that the Greens may end up playing an outsized role in October, said Turnbull. \u201cThere is a scenario in which May could be a kingmaker. And people really want to know \u2013 apart from the environment \u2013 what do the Greens want to do?\u201d she said. \u201cThere are scenarios in which even though she\u2019s probably going to have the fewest seats, she could still be at the table.\u201d",

I remember it quite well \u2013 probably because I have seen it 1,000 times at least since! It is the single greatest feeling in my career. Going to Southampton, we had a police escort and we were getting abuse from five miles out, from five-year-olds to grandparents. They scored in the 90th minute and we were devastated. But we had one last chance. The ball was lobbed towards the box, two of our players [Dave Kitson and Karim Rekik] went up for it and one of theirs [Jos\u00e9 Fonte] and it fell outside the penalty area and I<strong> </strong>thought: \u201cWhack it, see what happens.\u201d It flew in. I loved it, because it was so volatile and there was that much hatred, you could feel it and it spurs you on. Michael Appleton, our manager, played a blinder in a way. Just as we pulled up outside St Mary\u2019s, with our bus surrounded by their fans, he put on a motivational video of some of our better bits of the season.

I remember having a little bit of a Mourinho moment, running down the touchline screaming, shouting and punching the air because I had been getting stick for 90-odd minutes from the Southampton fans to the right of me. I had to give a little back. It was a fantastic moment. In the first game [a 1-1 draw in December 2011], it felt like football was almost the sideshow. I didn\u2019t realise how big a rivalry it was. I\u2019d been to watch Old Firm games, Manchester derbies, Merseyside derbies and was involved in Midlands derbies, West Brom v Wolves, but I found out about it in a big way, five games into my reign.</p> <h2><strong>Alan McLoughlin</strong></h2> <p><strong>Played for Southampton (1990-92) and Portsmouth (1992-99) and was a Portsmouth academy coach (2011-13)</strong></p> <p>I knew [after leaving Southampton for Portsmouth] that coming up the steps at Fratton Park I was going to be met to met with a barrage of \u201cScummer\u201d.

It didn\u2019t matter whether it was playing Southampton in an FA Cup game as I did in 1996 or a FA Youth Cup game, which I was part of as coach, there is always that edge and spice.

It was in the last minutes of the game and Peter Crouch put it away and we lost 2-1. It was a really difficult thing to deal with. I was lucky to be involved in such a fiercely contested game. It\u2019s not as bad as playing for West Ham at Millwall and the coach getting bricked; this one is tame compared to that, believe me.

ARL Group was among three companies to share in $16.5m in contracts to carry out debt recovery services for the Department of Human Services in the 2019-20 financial year, tender documents published in July show. The parent company is the Queensland-based debt acquisition and collection agency Panthera, which since July has been facing court proceedings brought by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC). The link between the two companies was first reported by the IT News website on Tuesday. In court filings, the ACCC alleged that ARL\u2019s parent company Panthera unduly harassed three consumers over electricity and phone company debts they did not owe. It accused Panthera of undue harassment and coercion, unconscionable conduct, and a false and misleading representation, the documents state.

It comes as the Coalition\u2019s data-matching debt recovery scheme faces a federal court challenge and a possible class action, while Labor and the Greens have called for it to be abolished. In particular, the Department of Human Services has faced particular criticism for referring thousands of debts to external debt collectors.

Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Amid this push, welfare recipients have complained that the first they have heard about their alleged debt is after being contacted by an external debt collector, while a Senate inquiry heard evidence of government-contracted debt collectors threatening to garnish the wages of people caught up in the scheme.

Lack of planes/staff, flight overbooking, a strike by airline staff or an IT failure are all considered to be within the airline\u2019s control \u2013 so compensation is payable.</p>\n    <p>Passengers on cancelled short-haul flights \u2013 up to 1,500km \u2013 are entitled to \u20ac250 or \u00a3230. For flights of 1,500km-3,500km, passengers are entitled to \u20ac400, and \u20ac600 for the longest flights (more than 3,500km).</p>\n    <p>Compensation is also payable if the plane is delayed. The payments are the same but only kick in when the plane has been delayed three hours for short flights or four hours for the longer trips. The delay is calculated against the time the plane was due to arrive.</p>\n    <p>Passengers are also entitled to \u2018assistance\u2019 under the EU rules. Short-haul passengers should receive food and water after two hours. Mid-distance passengers get help after three hours, while long-haul passengers receive it after they have been held in the terminal for four hours. If the delay is overnight, passengers should be provided with hotel accommodation but this often does not happen. This assistance should be provided irrespective of whether the delay is the airline\u2019s fault.</p>\n    <p>The airlines have fought these compensation rules since they were introduced and passengers have had to go to court to get their money. The airlines frequently blame delays on events outside their control. Freak weather events or a last-minute strike by air traffic controllers are deemed to be outside their control. A lack of planes or staff is not.</p>\n    <p>The rules only apply to EU-based airlines or all flights that start in the EU on non-EU based carriers.

McKay balances out Abi\u2019s very down-to-earth concerns \u2013 missing her Jamaican granny, her new stepbrothers, the teenage Max and the younger Louis \u2013 and the slow creep of the fantastical. This is magic without whimsy, a story about secrets and the power of books, with enough edge-of-the-seat moments to keep you hugging a cushion. In the US, more open-ended, hip-hop-inspired \u201cnovels\u201d in verse have been in circulation for some time. In the Key of Code (Walker) is a highlight in that relatively recent tradition. Aimee Lucido\u2019s debut is told in the form of poems, liberally littered with computer code and musical terminology. It is a daring exercise in form that carries its story very well. New girl Emmy, 12, is the unmusical child of musicians, and starting school in San Francisco. As she navigates the mean-girl social codes and a tense home life, coding club becomes an unlikely sanctuary. But her new friendship with Abigail is fraught with tension, and their amazing computer science teacher Ms Delaney is more often absent than not. You might not have thought that the words \u201cPUB-lic STAT-ic voidmain string BRACK-et BRACK-et ARGS\u201d could bring a computer layperson to tears, but they did, as this uncommon book reached its crescendo. \u2022 To order any of these books for a special price, click on the titles, go to guardianbookshop.com or call 0330 333 6846.

Instead Ferrari made another well-judged strategy call, reflecting a team operationally on form. In first and third on track, they pitted Vettel to cover Max Verstappen and with hope that he might undercut Hamilton. They, as with every other team, had not anticipated the huge undercut that the hard tyres offered \u2013 a 3.9-second advantage. Vettel flew on his out lap while Leclerc, despite the pedestrian pace of the first 19 laps, discovered that, when asked to push, his soft tyres had gone. Both were circumstances the team had not expected, rather than conspiracy. Their call was undeniably right. They had a one-two on track and had forced Mercedes into an alternate strategy that failed.</p> <h2>Mercedes wrong-footed</h2> <p>Not only did Ferrari find outstanding pace but Mercedes were not at their usual level of flawless execution. Ferrari went all out for a qualifying setup, which proved to be vital. With Ferrari\u2019s weakness through slow corners Mercedes, understandably perhaps, expected to have an advantage and had consequently concentrated on a strong race setup. They were clearly quicker on the long runs in practice but come Saturday morning, when the Ferraris came alive, the Mercedes\u2019 single-lap pace looked under threat and so it was. With track position so important Ferrari\u2019s qualifying allowed them to dictate the race, hence the slow pace at the start to back up the midfield to prevent an aggressive undercut from behind. Mercedes then rejected Hamilton\u2019s request to try an undercut and their gamble to send him long failed. Their chief strategist, James Vowles, admitted responsibility. Mercedes, however, will doubtless learn their lessons.

He has said they are to try some new ideas in 2020, especially for Friday and Saturday \u2013 including the possibility of a sprint race and changes to qualifying. Ferrari\u2019s team principal, Mattia Binotto, has said these have, in principle, already been agreed for three races in 2020.</p> <p>One of the ideas that has been mooted, however, was dismissed by drivers in Singapore \u2013 that of replacing qualifying with a sprint race started in reverse championship order. Hamilton sighed with frustration at the concept. \u201cThe people who proposed that don\u2019t really know what they are talking about,\u201d he said. Vettel described it as: \u201cComplete bullshit. I don\u2019t know which genius came up with that.\u201d Other series such as F2 do use reverse grids but, much as F1 can adapt, this would be a gimmick beneath the sport. The drivers\u2019 reactions suggest it will not be part of the three race test weekends next season.</p> <h2>Singapore needs a revamp</h2> <p>Much as Marina Bay at night sells its rich visual spectacle, on track the race was again less than gripping. Indeed , for all that broadcasters eulogise over how it looks, with grandiose helicopter shots of pleasure palace hotels looming over the circuit, it is simply window dressing for a race where out at the front it was a procession decided by strategy. Had it taken place in daylight, this would have been eerily similar to some of the least enlivening meetings at Valencia.</p> <p>There was overtaking and there were battles lower in the field but largely because of drivers being out of position. Hamilton asked the media if they had been \u201cbored\u201d and described it as \u201cworse than Monaco almost\u201d. It is a tough mental and physical test but that does not translate well into entertainment for fans. Nor does the near impossibility of overtaking in similarly matched cars, as proved by the top six. Hamilton at least had a suggestion that the organisers might think on: if the final corner were a tight hairpin, drivers could close properly on one another before the straight.</p>",

Ferrari\u2019s team principal, Mattia Binotto, has said these have, in principle, already been agreed for three races in 2020. One of the ideas that has been mooted, however, was dismissed by drivers in Singapore \u2013 that of replacing qualifying with a sprint race started in reverse championship order. Hamilton sighed with frustration at the concept. \u201cThe people who proposed that don\u2019t really know what they are talking about,\u201d he said. Vettel described it as: \u201cComplete bullshit. I don\u2019t know which genius came up with that.\u201d Other series such as F2 do use reverse grids but, much as F1 can adapt, this would be a gimmick beneath the sport. The drivers\u2019 reactions suggest it will not be part of the three race test weekends next season. Singapore needs a revamp Much as Marina Bay at night sells its rich visual spectacle, on track the race was again less than gripping. Indeed , for all that broadcasters eulogise over how it looks, with grandiose helicopter shots of pleasure palace hotels looming over the circuit, it is simply window dressing for a race where out at the front it was a procession decided by strategy. Had it taken place in daylight, this would have been eerily similar to some of the least enlivening meetings at Valencia. There was overtaking and there were battles lower in the field but largely because of drivers being out of position. Hamilton asked the media if they had been \u201cbored\u201d and described it as \u201cworse than Monaco almost\u201d. It is a tough mental and physical test but that does not translate well into entertainment for fans. Nor does the near impossibility of overtaking in similarly matched cars, as proved by the top six. Hamilton at least had a suggestion that the organisers might think on: if the final corner were a tight hairpin, drivers could close properly on one another before the straight.",

      "bodyText": "Spain\u2019s supreme court is expected to announce on Tuesday morning whether General Franco\u2019s remains can be exhumed from the vast mausoleum outside Madrid where they have lain since the dictator\u2019s death in 1975. Removing Franco\u2019s body from its tomb in the Valley of the Fallen has been one of the key priorities of the Spanish Socialist Workers\u2019 party (PSOE) since it came to power in June last year. PSOE argues the basilica and its 150-metre-high cross are a monument to the Franco regime that glorifies the winners of the civil war rather than commemorating its victims. \u201cThe wounds have been open for many years,\u201d Spanish prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, told parliament 14 months ago. \u201cToo many years. The time has come to close them.\u201d But the move has been bitterly opposed by the dictator\u2019s family and admirers. In June this year, just days before Franco\u2019s body was due to be dug up, the supreme court ordered the exhumation to be suspended while it considered an appeal from his family and other groups. Three months on, the court is due to reveal its ruling on whether the government can proceed with the removal of the valley\u2019s most famous occupant. The hulking monument, which was partly built by captured republicans and political prisoners, is a mass grave containing the remains of more than 30,000 people who fought on both sides of the war. Although supposedly a memorial to all those killed in the conflict, only two graves are marked: Franco\u2019s and that of Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera, the founder of the Falangist party. The Francisco Franco Foundation, which exists to promote and preserve the fascist dictator\u2019s legacy \u2013 and which was also part of the legal challenge \u2013 is already weighing up its next moves. \u201cWe\u2019re confident in the strength of our arguments,\u201d said the foundation\u2019s president, Juan Chicharro Ortega. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see what happens but the signs and media leaks may suggest that the supreme court will approve the exhumation order.\u201d However, Ortega believes that even if the body is exhumed, the move could yet backfire on the PSOE. It has been suggested that Franco could be reinterred next to his wife in her mausoleum in the Mingorrubio-El Pardo municipal cemetery near Madrid.

Lloyd\u2019s is the world\u2019s biggest and oldest insurance market.</p> <p>Lloyd\u2019s set up a bullying and harassment helpline in April, after <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-03-21/the-old-daytime-drinking-sexual-harassing-ways-are-thriving-at-lloyd-s\">Bloomberg reported</a> evidence from 18 women of widespread sexual harassment ranging from inappropriate remarks to physical assault, and commissioned the survey to gauge the scale of the problems.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/18/lloyds-of-london-boss-pledges-action-on-sexual-harassment\">More than 6,000 people responded to the survey</a>, which was sent out to the 45,000 people who work at Lloyd\u2019s. This includes thousands of brokers and underwriters working for 100 insurers and 300 broking firms, as well as 1,000 staff directly employed by Lloyd\u2019s. Overall, the gender balance is 50-50, although the ratio worsens for more senior roles. Of the corporation\u2019s top leaders, only 34% are women.</p> <p>Lloyd\u2019s said 8% of respondents to the survey \u2013 about 480 people \u2013 had either encountered sexual harassment themselves or witnessed it happening to others in the past year.</p> <p>John Neal, the chief executive, said: \u201cThat\u2019s pretty stark and totally unacceptable. The survey is validating in a pretty ugly way the issues that were raised six months ago.\u201d He said he was \u201cboth upset and disappointed\u201d at the findings.</p> <p>An industry insider described Lloyd\u2019s as a \u201cmeat market\u201d, while the shadow City minister Jonathan Reynolds labelled it \u201cinstitutionally sexist\u201d.</p> <p>Neal vowed to stamp out the problems within three to five years and said he would \u201cbe very disappointed if we didn\u2019t make significant progress in the next 12 months\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI am determined that we create a working environment at Lloyd\u2019s where everyone feels safe, valued and respected,\u201d he said. \u201cCultural change takes time, but we have to accelerate progress and the measures announced today are intended to do just that.\u201d</p> <p>The report also showed one in five working at Lloyd\u2019s do not believe people have equal opportunities.</p> <p>More than 20% said they had seen people in their organisation turn a blind eye to inappropriate behaviour, nearly a quarter had observed excessive consumption of alcohol in the Lloyd\u2019s market and a similar number said working at their firms had a negative impact on their health and wellbeing. </p> <p>In response to the report, Lloyd\u2019s set out further measures to tackle the problems.

      "bodyText": "The Lloyd\u2019s of London boss has described as \u201ctruly terrible\u201d the findings of a survey which showed that nearly 500 people working in the insurance market have either suffered or observed sexual harassment in the past 12 months. The survey, conducted by the Banking Standards Board on behalf of Lloyd\u2019s after news reports of bullying and harassment, found that \u201cthe experience of women is much less positive than it is for men\u201d. Lloyd\u2019s is the world\u2019s biggest and oldest insurance market. Lloyd\u2019s set up a bullying and harassment helpline in April, after Bloomberg reported evidence from 18 women of widespread sexual harassment ranging from inappropriate remarks to physical assault, and commissioned the survey to gauge the scale of the problems. More than 6,000 people responded to the survey, which was sent out to the 45,000 people who work at Lloyd\u2019s. This includes thousands of brokers and underwriters working for 100 insurers and 300 broking firms, as well as 1,000 staff directly employed by Lloyd\u2019s. Overall, the gender balance is 50-50, although the ratio worsens for more senior roles. Of the corporation\u2019s top leaders, only 34% are women. Lloyd\u2019s said 8% of respondents to the survey \u2013 about 480 people \u2013 had either encountered sexual harassment themselves or witnessed it happening to others in the past year. John Neal, the chief executive, said: \u201cThat\u2019s pretty stark and totally unacceptable. The survey is validating in a pretty ugly way the issues that were raised six months ago.\u201d He said he was \u201cboth upset and disappointed\u201d at the findings. An industry insider described Lloyd\u2019s as a \u201cmeat market\u201d, while the shadow City minister Jonathan Reynolds labelled it \u201cinstitutionally sexist\u201d. Neal vowed to stamp out the problems within three to five years and said he would \u201cbe very disappointed if we didn\u2019t make significant progress in the next 12 months\u201d. \u201cI am determined that we create a working environment at Lloyd\u2019s where everyone feels safe, valued and respected,\u201d he said. \u201cCultural change takes time, but we have to accelerate progress and the measures announced today are intended to do just that.\u201d The report also showed one in five working at Lloyd\u2019s do not believe people have equal opportunities. More than 20% said they had seen people in their organisation turn a blind eye to inappropriate behaviour, nearly a quarter had observed excessive consumption of alcohol in the Lloyd\u2019s market and a similar number said working at their firms had a negative impact on their health and wellbeing. In response to the report, Lloyd\u2019s set out further measures to tackle the problems. These include a \u201cgender balance plan\u201d setting clear, measurable targets and new \u201cstandards of business conduct\u201d. Lloyd\u2019s has already threatened lifetime bans for individuals found guilty of improper behaviour, and fines or bans for the firms that employ them. In recent months it has imposed temporary bans on a number of individuals for being drunk or making inappropriate remarks.",

The \u201cArea 51 Celebration\u201d in downtown Las Vegas did not get off to a promising start. When I arrived, shortly after 7pm, the outdoor venue \u2013 heavily bedecked with glowing neon alien signage \u2013 was mostly empty except for cops and local newscasters. A DJ blasted dubstep to a bare dancefloor. The venue even had a swimming pool, bathed in green light and watched by a bored-looking lifeguard.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c61d3dbbd15dddd205609f83e4ab23e5ace9f727\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c61d3dbbd15dddd205609f83e4ab23e5ace9f727/0_0_1800_1800/1000.png\" alt=\"Matty Roberts\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matty Roberts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: J Oliver Conroy/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I feared it might be a long night. I ordered a whiskey-and-water; the bartender filled a plastic stadium cup to the brim.</p> <p>Then people started trickling in. Everyone was wearing their best alien-themed rave attire: one woman wore a shiny, and discomfitingly rubbery, head-to-toe alien costume. Another had a Rick-and-Morty-patterned dress. Three men tore up the dancefloor in matching alien-motif onesies. Someone carried a sign that said GREEN LIVES MATTER.</p> <p>I talked to two people who\u2019d driven six hours from Tucson, Arizona, on a whim to attend. One was wearing a Flat Earth Society T-shirt, though he said it was ironic.</p> <p>I spied Matty Roberts in the center of a swirling mass of people, holding court. He was wearing a Slayer hat and black T-shirt; his long, dark hair flowed majestically down his back. He looked like a heavy metal-listening, Mountain Dew-drinking samurai lord, surrounded by courtiers and supplicants. I fought my way over.</p> <p>He was in high spirits. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely amazed at how things turned out, and it\u2019s incredible,\u201d he told me as he signed autographs. I opened my mouth to ask a follow-up question but he was swallowed up again by the crowd.</p> <p>By around 9pm, there were a couple hundred people jerking spasmodically to dubstep.</p> <p>A woman who introduced herself as Shereel (\u201cC-H-E-R-Y-L\u201d) said she was happy to be at the rave but disappointed she couldn\u2019t make the event in the desert.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the first time since Roswell that people like us are all coming together,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if nothing happens, we tried.\u201d</p> <p>The DJ interrupted his set to thank Matty Roberts and give a \u201cspecial shout-out\u201d to Bob Lazar. The crowd cheered.</p> <p>A warm wind was whipping through the arena. As the wind buffeted us and the rave lights flickered overhead, you could almost believe a UFO really was about to descend.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ea9e63f0196c4a65d035975c44dbab2dff5ccaba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea9e63f0196c4a65d035975c44dbab2dff5ccaba/0_0_1650_1800/917.png\" alt=\"The alien statue outside the Alien Research Center, Hiko, NV.\" width=\"917\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The alien statue outside the Alien Research Center, Hiko.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: J Oliver Conroy/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>The next morning I got in my rental car and headed north.</p> <p>The outskirts of Las Vegas \u2013 casinos, strip clubs, endless billboards for personal injury lawyers \u2013 dropped away rapidly. Now there was just desert in every direction, stunning in its vastness and austere beauty. Mountains towered over the highway, surrounded by hilly plains of cacti and scrub.</p> <p>Soon most human settlement was gone. There was nothing alongside the highway \u2013 no strip malls, no fast food joints, and, I noticed, worryingly few gas stations. I had at least two hours of driving ahead, though I knew I was going in the right direction: every vehicle I saw was a police car, an RV or a news satellite van.</p> <p>As I drove I listened to rightwing talk radio, then Top 40, then country, then a Bible discussion call-in show, then some Spanish-language stations, then static. A talk station interviewed the mother of a police officer killed by an undocumented immigrant. Sean Hannity made fun of the climate strike, and every talkshow discussed the New York Times\u2019 recent, partly retracted accusation against Brett Kavanaugh. It was, they pointed out, yet another sign of bias in the liberal media.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Soon most human settlement was gone. There wasn\u2019t even anything alongside the highway.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The first gas station was bustling with people buying water and jerry cans of gas. In the parking lot there was a camper van marked \u201cAREA 51 \u2013 HERE WE COME\u201d.</p> <p>Finally, two hours north of Las Vegas, I saw the exit for State Route 375 \u2013 also known, since its formal renaming in 1996, as Extraterrestrial Highway.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>The US government owns thousands of square miles of land in northern Nevada. The area is big enough, and empty enough, to detonate a nuclear bomb \u2013 which the government <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/Exercise_Desert_Rock_I_%28Buster-Jangle_Dog%29_002.jpg\">has</a>, on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/sep/21/building-the-atom-bomb-the-full-story-of-the-nevada-test-site\">hundreds</a> of occasions.</p> <p>The \u201cGroom Lake airfield\u201d \u2013 Area 51 \u2013 is part of a massive complex of military installations. Their activities are classified and the skies above are restricted air space. Little is known about what goes on there, though the air force tests experimental stealth aircraft, which may account for some UFO sightings.</p> <p>Of course, military pilots are themselves known to report seeing what they refer to as \u201cunexplained aerial phenomena\u201d. (Even the New York Times has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/26/us/politics/ufo-sightings-navy-pilots.html\">reported</a> on it.)</p> <p>In the 2000s, Congress established an \u201cadvanced aviation threat identification program\u201d to study the <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/09/06/navy-withholding-ufo-sightings-1698396\">problem</a>. The program wasn\u2019t classified, but it \u201coperated with the knowledge of an extremely limited number of officials\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/12/16/pentagon-ufo-search-harry-reid-216111\">according</a> to Politico. The then Nevada senator Harry Reid helped secure the funding.</p> <p>That\u2019s the end of the history lesson. The reader is free to investigate further and come to their own conclusions.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>On the way to Rachel, I stopped at the rival festival at the Alien Research Center in Hiko. It was heavy on souvenir sellers, though there were some hardcore ufologists. A group called the Mutual UFO Network (Mufon) gave me a pamphlet offering certification to be a \u201cfield investigator\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f41fb1808ba41ffb3ec9b7cacc98408eb02c9b31\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f41fb1808ba41ffb3ec9b7cacc98408eb02c9b31/0_0_1650_1800/917.png\" alt=\"Signs and concertina wire at the Area 51 checkpoint.\" width=\"917\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Signs and concertina wire at the Area 51 checkpoint.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: J Oliver Conroy/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If anything, the ufologists were more the exception than the rule. I had expected most Area 51 Stormers to be conspiracy theorists, 4chan types, or people on the fringe political spectrum, but a lot \u2013 probably most \u2013 were normies on a lark, or foreigners in search of peak Americana.</p> <p>Two young men \u2013 one Swiss German, the other Japanese \u2013 told me they were friends who\u2019d met at an English as a second language program in New York. A group of Britons told me they\u2019d been taking a road trip up the west coast, heard about the Area 51 business, and decided to take a detour.</p> <p>This was a common theme: \u201c<em>Well, I\u2019d been thinking about taking a road trip </em>anyway<em>, sooo\u2026</em><em>\u201d</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>When my car turned the last switchback into the valley toward Area 51, the car radio, theretofore static, suddenly started blasting Smetana\u2019s M\u00e1 Vlast in eerie, crystal-perfect sound. The aliens, it seemed, were classical music buffs.</p> <p>Rachel came into view \u2013 a tiny, one-horse town besieged by cars and tents and camper vans. Including the cops, EMTs, festival organizers, and so on, there looked to be a couple thousand people \u2013 not the two million who had RSVP\u2019d to the Facebook event, nor the 30,000 the sheriff <a href=\"https://www.ktnv.com/news/investigations/lincoln-co-sheriff-do-not-attempt-to-cross-into-area-51-during-music-festival\">feared</a>, but more than I thought would follow through.</p> <p>Contrary to the wild warnings about a Fyre festival 2.0, things appeared mostly under control. Festival marshals waved me along to an assigned lot.</p> <p>My neighbors at the parking lot-slash-campsite were a punk band called Foreign Life Form. They weren\u2019t part of the planned music lineup, one Life Form explained as he ate Chef Boyardee room-temperature from a can, but when they heard about Alienstock, it seemed like fate. They were trying to find the concert organizer to get added to the billing. To help seal the deal they\u2019d painted their faces and arms green.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2058d5ebc05327a8a04a724ab048db47ddaa8f9b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2058d5ebc05327a8a04a724ab048db47ddaa8f9b/0_0_1402_1479/948.jpg\" alt=\"A member of the punk band Foreign Life Form, body painted green, eating a can of Chef Boyardee at his campsite.\" width=\"948\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A member of the punk band Foreign Life Form, body painted green, eating a can of Chef Boyardee at his campsite.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: J Oliver Conroy/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My other neighbor, an erudite, joint-smoking history podcaster from Oregon, wore a T-shirt that said \u201cTake me to your dealer\u201d. He and his son had had the shirts custom-made; the Life Forms were disappointed they couldn\u2019t buy some.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Getting to the actual entrance to Area 51 took another 20 minutes of driving on an unmarked, unpaved road. Clouds of chalk billowed behind the cars coming and going.</p> <p>At the end of the road was a drab military checkpoint flanked by concertina wire and threatening signs. The sign prohibiting photography was clearly a dead letter.</p> <p>Rotating shifts of law enforcement officers of every variety \u2013 sheriff\u2019s deputies, state troopers, game wardens, park rangers \u2013 kept a watchful eye on everything. They seemed relaxed, though, and looked like they were having as good a time as the ostensible Stormers. After all, this was an excuse for them to hang out at Area 51, too.</p> <p>(To my knowledge, no one actually raided Area 51, besides the two Dutch YouTubers who had <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/storm-area-51-meme-lands-dutch-youtuber-in-jail/\">tried</a> to sneak through the perimeter two weeks earlier and ended up in jail instead.)</p> <p>In addition to YouTube vloggers and Instagram influencers, there were more than a few actual journalists. Watching them scurry around diligently with tape recorders reminded me that I needed to find a Quirky Character who could give On-Scene Color. A talkative UFO buff would be ideal but the other journalists had already claimed most of the good ones.</p> <p>I couldn\u2019t avoid noticing a pair of men in huge, papier-mache Pepe the Frog heads. The vloggers loved them, and the Pepes enjoyed mugging for the cameras. \u201cMy God,\u201d a girl said, \u201cthey\u2019re <em>adorable</em>.\u201d</p> <p>Under their frog heads, the Pepes were two young Latino guys from California. When I asked them what they thought of the frog\u2019s association with the alt-right, one seemed confused. The other nodded in recognition but claimed he just thought the symbol was fun.</p> <p>He said, \u201cIt\u2019s all about the \u2013\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMemes,\u201d finished the other. They both laughed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"db1b309f2ecb643023522d61fcce4307753f03c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db1b309f2ecb643023522d61fcce4307753f03c6/77_54_1317_1503/876.png\" alt=\"Two Pepe the Frog enthusiasts.

The temperature was dropping fast and the sun was low and pink in the sky. The sunset was sublime but I had a long drive to my motel ahead and a sick feeling that I should have left half an hour ago.</p> <p>I bade farewell to the history podcaster. He reminded me that the area was open grazing land. \u201cWatch out for the steer,\u201d he said. \u201cThey go right out into the road.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>The next morning I debated whether to squeeze in another trip out to Alienstock and couldn\u2019t quite find the willpower. It was time to get back to civilization, I decided. Or at least Las Vegas.</p> <p>I stopped at the gas station in Alamo, near Rachel. The town felt hungover, and it still had a day to go. Most of the locals seemed unsure quite <a href=\"http://www.rachel-nevada.com/alienstock/index.html\">how to feel</a> about the whole thing. It was a boon to the local economy, yes, but also a financial disaster for the county government. There were rumors that the district attorney was planning to sue Connie West, or Matty Roberts, or even Facebook.</p> <p>Most, though, just seemed excited at the idea that their corner of the world might become something bigger than a gas stop on the way elsewhere.</p> <p>Everyone vowed that next year, they\u2019d be ready.</p>",

Dozens of young, good-looking, often costumed people were running around filming each other with semi-professional video rigs. They were YouTube and Instagram stars \u2013 or, more often, aspiring stars \u2013 here to \u201cstorm\u201d Area 51 for the benefit of their followers and free the aliens held captive within. Or at least film themselves talking about it. Joining them was a ragged army of hundreds of stoners, UFO buffs, punk bands, rubberneckers, European tourists, people with way too much time on their hands, and meme-lords in Pepe the Frog costumes \u2013 all here because of the Internet, the ironic and the earnest alike, for a party at the end of the earth. \u2022\u2022\u2022 Three months earlier, on 20 June 2019, the podcaster Joe Rogan released an interview with Bob Lazar. Lazar is a cult figure in UFO circles; he claims to have studied flying saucers at Area 51, the classified air force base in Nevada where the US government is rumored \u2013 by some \u2013 to make secret contact with extraterrestrial beings. Rogan\u2019s millions of listeners heard the interview. One of those listeners was Matty Roberts, a college student, anime enthusiast and video gamer in Bakersfield, California. Inspired by the Rogan podcast, Roberts created a joke Facebook event: \u201cStorm Area 51, They Can\u2019t Stop All of Us.\u201d According to the plan, people would meet in Rachel, Nevada \u2013 the closest town to Area 51 \u2013 in the early morning of 20 September, then swarm the defenses and see for themselves if the government was hiding aliens. Things snowballed. Within hours, the page had thousands of RSVPs. Within days it had more than a million. The air force warned that things would end badly for anyone attempting a raid. The FBI paid the hapless Matty Roberts a house call. So he came up with a brilliant pivot: why not channel this momentum into a Burning Man-style music festival in the desert? He joined forces with Connie West, the operator of Rachel\u2019s sole inn and restaurant, to plan what they called Alienstock. Then came the first schism. Scornful of the internet interlopers, the Alien Research Center in nearby Hiko, Nevada, decided to host its own Area 51 event the same weekend \u2013 for serious ufologists. Roberts and West pressed on. But the town of Rachel (population: 54) lacked the infrastructure to handle thousands of conspiracy theorists and gawkers descending on rural Nevada. The local authorities feared potential calamity: people dying of dehydration in the desert, angry landowners, madmen with guns. On 10 September, nine days before the event, Roberts backed out. He wanted no involvement in a \u201cFyre Fest 2.0\u201d, he told the media. He accused West of being insufficiently prepared for the coming flood. Budweiser offered to sponsor a free, alternative Alienstock event in a \u201csafe, clean\u201d venue in downtown Las Vegas. Roberts urged people to go there instead. West refused to cancel the concert in the desert. She\u2019d already sunk thousands of dollars of her own money into the event, she told reporters as she held back tears. Alienstock would happen, she said, whether anyone liked it or not. Now there were three rival events all happening on the same weekend \u2013 one in Las Vegas, another in Rachel and a third in Hiko. No one had any idea how many people were coming. \u2022\u2022\u2022 I came equipped with a duffel bag of Hawaiian shirts and a case of vape cartridges, which I hoped to use as currency in the event of civilizational collapse in the desert. But the desert would wait. The \u201cArea 51 Celebration\u201d in downtown Las Vegas did not get off to a promising start. When I arrived, shortly after 7pm, the outdoor venue \u2013 heavily bedecked with glowing neon alien signage \u2013 was mostly empty except for cops and local newscasters. A DJ blasted dubstep to a bare dancefloor. The venue even had a swimming pool, bathed in green light and watched by a bored-looking lifeguard. I feared it might be a long night. I ordered a whiskey-and-water; the bartender filled a plastic stadium cup to the brim. Then people started trickling in. Everyone was wearing their best alien-themed rave attire: one woman wore a shiny, and discomfitingly rubbery, head-to-toe alien costume. Another had a Rick-and-Morty-patterned dress. Three men tore up the dancefloor in matching alien-motif onesies. Someone carried a sign that said GREEN LIVES MATTER. I talked to two people who\u2019d driven six hours from Tucson, Arizona, on a whim to attend. One was wearing a Flat Earth Society T-shirt, though he said it was ironic. I spied Matty Roberts in the center of a swirling mass of people, holding court. He was wearing a Slayer hat and black T-shirt; his long, dark hair flowed majestically down his back. He looked like a heavy metal-listening, Mountain Dew-drinking samurai lord, surrounded by courtiers and supplicants. I fought my way over. He was in high spirits. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely amazed at how things turned out, and it\u2019s incredible,\u201d he told me as he signed autographs. I opened my mouth to ask a follow-up question but he was swallowed up again by the crowd. By around 9pm, there were a couple hundred people jerking spasmodically to dubstep. A woman who introduced herself as Shereel (\u201cC-H-E-R-Y-L\u201d) said she was happy to be at the rave but disappointed she couldn\u2019t make the event in the desert. \u201cThis is the first time since Roswell that people like us are all coming together,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if nothing happens, we tried.\u201d The DJ interrupted his set to thank Matty Roberts and give a \u201cspecial shout-out\u201d to Bob Lazar. The crowd cheered. A warm wind was whipping through the arena. As the wind buffeted us and the rave lights flickered overhead, you could almost believe a UFO really was about to descend. \u2022\u2022\u2022 The next morning I got in my rental car and headed north. The outskirts of Las Vegas \u2013 casinos, strip clubs, endless billboards for personal injury lawyers \u2013 dropped away rapidly. Now there was just desert in every direction, stunning in its vastness and austere beauty. Mountains towered over the highway, surrounded by hilly plains of cacti and scrub. Soon most human settlement was gone. There was nothing alongside the highway \u2013 no strip malls, no fast food joints, and, I noticed, worryingly few gas stations. I had at least two hours of driving ahead, though I knew I was going in the right direction: every vehicle I saw was a police car, an RV or a news satellite van. As I drove I listened to rightwing talk radio, then Top 40, then country, then a Bible discussion call-in show, then some Spanish-language stations, then static. A talk station interviewed the mother of a police officer killed by an undocumented immigrant. Sean Hannity made fun of the climate strike, and every talkshow discussed the New York Times\u2019 recent, partly retracted accusation against Brett Kavanaugh. It was, they pointed out, yet another sign of bias in the liberal media. The first gas station was bustling with people buying water and jerry cans of gas. In the parking lot there was a camper van marked \u201cAREA 51 \u2013 HERE WE COME\u201d. Finally, two hours north of Las Vegas, I saw the exit for State Route 375 \u2013 also known, since its formal renaming in 1996, as Extraterrestrial Highway. \u2022\u2022\u2022 The US government owns thousands of square miles of land in northern Nevada. The area is big enough, and empty enough, to detonate a nuclear bomb \u2013 which the government has, on hundreds of occasions. The \u201cGroom Lake airfield\u201d \u2013 Area 51 \u2013 is part of a massive complex of military installations. Their activities are classified and the skies above are restricted air space. Little is known about what goes on there, though the air force tests experimental stealth aircraft, which may account for some UFO sightings. Of course, military pilots are themselves known to report seeing what they refer to as \u201cunexplained aerial phenomena\u201d. (Even the New York Times has reported on it.) In the 2000s, Congress established an \u201cadvanced aviation threat identification program\u201d to study the problem. The program wasn\u2019t classified, but it \u201coperated with the knowledge of an extremely limited number of officials\u201d, according to Politico. The then Nevada senator Harry Reid helped secure the funding. That\u2019s the end of the history lesson. The reader is free to investigate further and come to their own conclusions. \u2022\u2022\u2022 On the way to Rachel, I stopped at the rival festival at the Alien Research Center in Hiko. It was heavy on souvenir sellers, though there were some hardcore ufologists. A group called the Mutual UFO Network (Mufon) gave me a pamphlet offering certification to be a \u201cfield investigator\u201d. If anything, the ufologists were more the exception than the rule. I had expected most Area 51 Stormers to be conspiracy theorists, 4chan types, or people on the fringe political spectrum, but a lot \u2013 probably most \u2013 were normies on a lark, or foreigners in search of peak Americana. Two young men \u2013 one Swiss German, the other Japanese \u2013 told me they were friends who\u2019d met at an English as a second language program in New York. A group of Britons told me they\u2019d been taking a road trip up the west coast, heard about the Area 51 business, and decided to take a detour. This was a common theme: \u201cWell, I\u2019d been thinking about taking a road trip anyway, sooo\u2026\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 When my car turned the last switchback into the valley toward Area 51, the car radio, theretofore static, suddenly started blasting Smetana\u2019s M\u00e1 Vlast in eerie, crystal-perfect sound. The aliens, it seemed, were classical music buffs. Rachel came into view \u2013 a tiny, one-horse town besieged by cars and tents and camper vans. Including the cops, EMTs, festival organizers, and so on, there looked to be a couple thousand people \u2013 not the two million who had RSVP\u2019d to the Facebook event, nor the 30,000 the sheriff feared, but more than I thought would follow through. Contrary to the wild warnings about a Fyre festival 2.0, things appeared mostly under control. Festival marshals waved me along to an assigned lot. My neighbors at the parking lot-slash-campsite were a punk band called Foreign Life Form. They weren\u2019t part of the planned music lineup, one Life Form explained as he ate Chef Boyardee room-temperature from a can, but when they heard about Alienstock, it seemed like fate. They were trying to find the concert organizer to get added to the billing. To help seal the deal they\u2019d painted their faces and arms green. My other neighbor, an erudite, joint-smoking history podcaster from Oregon, wore a T-shirt that said \u201cTake me to your dealer\u201d. He and his son had had the shirts custom-made; the Life Forms were disappointed they couldn\u2019t buy some. \u2022\u2022\u2022 Getting to the actual entrance to Area 51 took another 20 minutes of driving on an unmarked, unpaved road. Clouds of chalk billowed behind the cars coming and going. At the end of the road was a drab military checkpoint flanked by concertina wire and threatening signs. The sign prohibiting photography was clearly a dead letter. Rotating shifts of law enforcement officers of every variety \u2013 sheriff\u2019s deputies, state troopers, game wardens, park rangers \u2013 kept a watchful eye on everything. They seemed relaxed, though, and looked like they were having as good a time as the ostensible Stormers. After all, this was an excuse for them to hang out at Area 51, too. (To my knowledge, no one actually raided Area 51, besides the two Dutch YouTubers who had tried to sneak through the perimeter two weeks earlier and ended up in jail instead.) In addition to YouTube vloggers and Instagram influencers, there were more than a few actual journalists. Watching them scurry around diligently with tape recorders reminded me that I needed to find a Quirky Character who could give On-Scene Color. A talkative UFO buff would be ideal but the other journalists had already claimed most of the good ones. I couldn\u2019t avoid noticing a pair of men in huge, papier-mache Pepe the Frog heads. The vloggers loved them, and the Pepes enjoyed mugging for the cameras. \u201cMy God,\u201d a girl said, \u201cthey\u2019re adorable.\u201d Under their frog heads, the Pepes were two young Latino guys from California. When I asked them what they thought of the frog\u2019s association with the alt-right, one seemed confused. The other nodded in recognition but claimed he just thought the symbol was fun. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s all about the \u2013\u201d \u201cMemes,\u201d finished the other. They both laughed. I asked if it wasn\u2019t weird for them, as Latinos, to embrace a symbol affiliated with white nationalists. \u201cYeah, I mean, they\u2019re a little, like, extreme for me sometimes,\u201d one said. \u201cBut sometimes you feel like they\u2019re right about some stuff.\u201d I said, \u201cLike what?\u201d \u201cLike clown world.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cClown world.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cLike the idea that we\u2019re all living in a world of clowns,\u201d he clarified. Tendrils of fog hung over Alienstock. The temperature was dropping fast and the sun was low and pink in the sky. The sunset was sublime but I had a long drive to my motel ahead and a sick feeling that I should have left half an hour ago. I bade farewell to the history podcaster. He reminded me that the area was open grazing land. \u201cWatch out for the steer,\u201d he said. \u201cThey go right out into the road.\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 The next morning I debated whether to squeeze in another trip out to Alienstock and couldn\u2019t quite find the willpower. It was time to get back to civilization, I decided. Or at least Las Vegas. I stopped at the gas station in Alamo, near Rachel. The town felt hungover, and it still had a day to go. Most of the locals seemed unsure quite how to feel about the whole thing. It was a boon to the local economy, yes, but also a financial disaster for the county government. There were rumors that the district attorney was planning to sue Connie West, or Matty Roberts, or even Facebook. Most, though, just seemed excited at the idea that their corner of the world might become something bigger than a gas stop on the way elsewhere. Everyone vowed that next year, they\u2019d be ready.",

As year 11 is when students take GCSEs, this statistic suggests some schools might be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/sep/06/10000-pupils-disappear-from-english-schools-at-critical-stage-of-gcses\" title=\"\">removing students</a> just prior to their sitting these exams. Could it be that some schools improve their GCSE scores by shedding pupils? Clearly, if we have a school system that is judged primarily on its exam scores, the pressure on schools to exclude pupils is high.</p> <p>It is not the only way to judge a school. Utopian that I am, I could imagine a system in which there could be a high rating for schools that held on to vulnerable or challenging pupils, enabling them to get even a minimum qualification.</p> <p>I also wondered what kind of schools exclude the most pupils. A Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/aug/31/sunderland-school-suspended-more-than-half-its-pupils-in-a-year\" title=\"\">report</a> a few days before your announcement showed exclusions were increasing and some academy trusts had particularly high rates \u2013 one academy in Sunderland suspended more than half its pupils in a year. Really? Is there something so bad about young people in Sunderland that half of them need to be sent home for a while?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/may/14/inside-schools-that-havent-expelled-child-since-2013-exclusion\">Everyone welcome: inside the schools that haven\u2019t expelled a child since 2013</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I hope you are working to find out whether there is the possibility that academies are excluding pupils (fixed-term or permanently) at a faster rate than local authority schools. Could it be that the solution you are proposing for excluded pupils \u2013 namely setting up free schools \u2013 was partly caused by the creation of the academy system, of which the free schools are a part?</p> <p>You will also know that there are accountability issues. Individual schools are not ultimately responsible for children under 16 \u2013 that is the remit of a local authority. When all schools were local authority schools, we knew as parents that our locally elected authority was handling this, even if it was different departments. Now, we have a situation in which academies or free schools know that if they \u201close\u201d pupils it\u2019s not the school or trust that has to pick up the pieces. It is the legal obligation of the local authority.</p> <p>Managing vulnerable and challenging pupils should be part of a universal provision for young people, under the eye of elected representatives from their local community. Sometimes it might be ideal to handle such pupils in units within schools, sometimes off-site, sometimes a mix of both. Whichever way, let it be done by the authority that is legally responsible, not by outsourcing it to the free-school scheme.</p> <p><strong>Yours,</strong> <strong>Michael Rosen</strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "I see you will be \u201cpushing for something that isn\u2019t often the focus of dinner party debate\u201d: alternative provision, especially for children who have been or are at risk of being expelled from mainstream schools. Your solution for this is a \u201cnew wave\u201d of free schools. As I write, I\u2019m aware you\u2019re not in a position to \u201cpush\u201d for anything because parliament isn\u2019t sitting and you are part of a minority government. I\u2019m also not sure what dinner parties have to do with the matter. Perhaps they are a way of flagging up that you are in a government that is on the side of the people against some obnoxious dinner-partying elite. Your focus on exclusions caught my eye, because in March I read a report from the Royal Society of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA) that showed \u201cthere is a significant increase in pupil referral unit admissions in the first term of year 11\u201d. As year 11 is when students take GCSEs, this statistic suggests some schools might be removing students just prior to their sitting these exams. Could it be that some schools improve their GCSE scores by shedding pupils? Clearly, if we have a school system that is judged primarily on its exam scores, the pressure on schools to exclude pupils is high. It is not the only way to judge a school. Utopian that I am, I could imagine a system in which there could be a high rating for schools that held on to vulnerable or challenging pupils, enabling them to get even a minimum qualification. I also wondered what kind of schools exclude the most pupils. A Guardian report a few days before your announcement showed exclusions were increasing and some academy trusts had particularly high rates \u2013 one academy in Sunderland suspended more than half its pupils in a year. Really? Is there something so bad about young people in Sunderland that half of them need to be sent home for a while? I hope you are working to find out whether there is the possibility that academies are excluding pupils (fixed-term or permanently) at a faster rate than local authority schools. Could it be that the solution you are proposing for excluded pupils \u2013 namely setting up free schools \u2013 was partly caused by the creation of the academy system, of which the free schools are a part? You will also know that there are accountability issues. Individual schools are not ultimately responsible for children under 16 \u2013 that is the remit of a local authority. When all schools were local authority schools, we knew as parents that our locally elected authority was handling this, even if it was different departments. Now, we have a situation in which academies or free schools know that if they \u201close\u201d pupils it\u2019s not the school or trust that has to pick up the pieces. It is the legal obligation of the local authority. Managing vulnerable and challenging pupils should be part of a universal provision for young people, under the eye of elected representatives from their local community. Sometimes it might be ideal to handle such pupils in units within schools, sometimes off-site, sometimes a mix of both. Whichever way, let it be done by the authority that is legally responsible, not by outsourcing it to the free-school scheme. Yours, Michael Rosen",

I\u2019ve been to loads of the damn things, so you might think that, by now, I would have an inkling.</p> <p>In the olden days, I used to think the conferences were for the delegates. They work hard all year on their weird hobby: politics. Why should they not get a few days by the seaside? They deserve a hotel, a fling, a dance on a sticky carpet in the name of making the world a better place . Yet, apart from Brighton (London by the Sea), the seaside towns don\u2019t have what slick party machines need any more. The conference halls are not big enough, the accommodation is too smelly and the food isn\u2019t what many of our MPs have come to expect.</p> <p>So Blackpool was done for years ago, which tells you everything you need to know about how the Westminster-centric world works. It was simply beyond the pale to change trains at Preston, stay somewhere that wasn\u2019t a boutique hotel and dine on lovely carbs.</p> <p>I am no better or worse when it comes to this. I was in Blackpool in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/oct/04/conservatives2005.conservatives1\">2005 when David Cameron made </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/oct/04/conservatives2005.conservatives1\">the \u201clook no notes\u201d speech</a> that propelled him to the Tory leadership, but I spent most of that time in TK Maxx. Sort of hiding. Never quite knowing what to do.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/23/labour-conference-brexit-pro-remain-activists-corbyn\">Labour conference and Brexit: how will the vote play out?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Obviously, once you leave the conference centre, most people in whatever city you are in do not know the conference is going on, or what it is for. My reasoning is that I may as well lurk around shopping centres because, at an event where every journalist is looking for \u201cnews\u201d, the likelihood of there being any is extremely remote. Now, even more so. Every snitch of gossip is tweeted out: this weekend it was Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, shouting at the Momentum founder Jon Lansman that he was \u201cthe hitman that missed\u201d, after his failed attempt to oust Watson.</p> <p>The big story of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s loss of control over his own party, the war going on between his inner circle and er \u2026 everyone else, is utterly depressing. Conference is now squeezing spots in public.</p> <p>If you like, you can blame the media for this, but the fact is that the splits in our main parties are not media inventions. You might have thought that what with all the current proroguery, this peculiar relocation of politicians and hacks would be suspended, but conference is about money, subsidies and funding. Good old face-to-face interaction is necessary in a digital era, but as the party system is in collapse then it has to be said that the three weeks of conference season are not fit for purpose.</p> <p>Now it all exists to be televised and speeches are given in half-empty halls while mediocre offerings from any dear leader are given compulsory ovations. The disconnect between representative democracy as it should be and this facade is on full display at these rallies.</p> <p>If you want to know which way the wind is blowing then look at the stalls and sponsorship and where the money moves to. Look at the cut of the suits. Then wander outside and away.</p> <p>It is really not enough to say, well, the country is deeply divided on Brexit and conference simply reflects those divisions. Conference is actually part of that division and has been for years. I don\u2019t know how anyone can attend these events and think otherwise. The Labour MP Jess Phillips recently described it all as \u201ca massive waste of time \u2026 I have no idea why we do it.\u201d</p> <p>Some pretend it is where new thinking can be found. Really? Truth is, it can be fun \u2013 after all, who can resist a glass of something, an egg sandwich and a great discussion of how awful everyone else is?

      "bodyText": "What happens at a party conference that can\u2019t happen in real life? I often wonder. I\u2019ve been to loads of the damn things, so you might think that, by now, I would have an inkling. In the olden days, I used to think the conferences were for the delegates. They work hard all year on their weird hobby: politics. Why should they not get a few days by the seaside? They deserve a hotel, a fling, a dance on a sticky carpet in the name of making the world a better place . Yet, apart from Brighton (London by the Sea), the seaside towns don\u2019t have what slick party machines need any more. The conference halls are not big enough, the accommodation is too smelly and the food isn\u2019t what many of our MPs have come to expect. So Blackpool was done for years ago, which tells you everything you need to know about how the Westminster-centric world works. It was simply beyond the pale to change trains at Preston, stay somewhere that wasn\u2019t a boutique hotel and dine on lovely carbs. I am no better or worse when it comes to this. I was in Blackpool in 2005 when David Cameron made the \u201clook no notes\u201d speech that propelled him to the Tory leadership, but I spent most of that time in TK Maxx. Sort of hiding. Never quite knowing what to do. Obviously, once you leave the conference centre, most people in whatever city you are in do not know the conference is going on, or what it is for. My reasoning is that I may as well lurk around shopping centres because, at an event where every journalist is looking for \u201cnews\u201d, the likelihood of there being any is extremely remote. Now, even more so. Every snitch of gossip is tweeted out: this weekend it was Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, shouting at the Momentum founder Jon Lansman that he was \u201cthe hitman that missed\u201d, after his failed attempt to oust Watson. The big story of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s loss of control over his own party, the war going on between his inner circle and er \u2026 everyone else, is utterly depressing. Conference is now squeezing spots in public. If you like, you can blame the media for this, but the fact is that the splits in our main parties are not media inventions. You might have thought that what with all the current proroguery, this peculiar relocation of politicians and hacks would be suspended, but conference is about money, subsidies and funding. Good old face-to-face interaction is necessary in a digital era, but as the party system is in collapse then it has to be said that the three weeks of conference season are not fit for purpose. Now it all exists to be televised and speeches are given in half-empty halls while mediocre offerings from any dear leader are given compulsory ovations. The disconnect between representative democracy as it should be and this facade is on full display at these rallies. If you want to know which way the wind is blowing then look at the stalls and sponsorship and where the money moves to. Look at the cut of the suits. Then wander outside and away. It is really not enough to say, well, the country is deeply divided on Brexit and conference simply reflects those divisions. Conference is actually part of that division and has been for years. I don\u2019t know how anyone can attend these events and think otherwise. The Labour MP Jess Phillips recently described it all as \u201ca massive waste of time \u2026 I have no idea why we do it.\u201d Some pretend it is where new thinking can be found. Really? Truth is, it can be fun \u2013 after all, who can resist a glass of something, an egg sandwich and a great discussion of how awful everyone else is? Not me. But don\u2019t mistake it for the main story, whatever the media tell you. Conference is all that is wrong with Westminster, simply relocated. It is sometimes said of alcoholics who pretend they are solving their problems by going to live elsewhere that they are \u201cdoing a geographical\u201d. Instead, of course, they continue the same behaviour in a different environment. In this case with free wine. \u2022 This article was amended on 24 September 2019 because an earlier version incorrectly referred to Cameron\u2019s \u201clook no notes\u201d speech in Blackpool in 2007, which propelled him to the Tory party leadership.

We now confront a situation in which language proves as dangerous as policy.</p> <p>Politicians can no longer merely disagree. They must be acting in bad faith, or subverting democracy, or betraying the electorate. This finds its extreme form in the word \u201ctreason\u201d, which now peppers and pollutes the language of rightwing politicians and commentators. But it has also insinuated itself into the way we address Brexit altogether.</p> <p>The essential toxin here is the requirement for political purity. This is partly driven by the increasing radicalism of our mainstream political parties and partly by the appetite for nationalism unleashed by the referendum and now rapidly advancing.</p> <p>Britain is no longer just riven politically and economically, but fully entrenched in a culture war which demands rigid and extreme conceptions of identity. This new polarisation necessitates an all-or-nothing stance not just on Brexit, but on politics altogether. When we join battle on those lines, we leave no room for anything in between or any obvious route to heal afterwards.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Top tweet</h2> <p>A left-leaning journalist despairs at Labour\u2019s Brexit policy contortions:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IanDunt/status/1176090958741549058\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Brexit was celebrated by the far-right around Europe and the US.

You can also catch our latest Brexit Means \u2026 podcast here, and for daily updates, head to Andrew Sparrow\u2019s politics live blog. Top stories Brexit is just over a month away and despite repeated claims by the government that progress is being made on changes to the withdrawal deal that might somehow make it acceptable to MPs, there\u2019s still no evidence to suggest that\u2019s actually the case. In a speech in Strasbourg the president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, demanded operable proposals, in writing, from the UK on replacing the Irish backstop and warned a no-deal exit was now a \u201cpalpable risk\u201d. Finland, which holds the rotating presidency of the Council of the European Union, and France said whatever Britain did come up with would have to be tabled within a fortnight so it could be properly discussed by the EU27 before next month\u2019s summit. But it emerged that Boris Johnson had been \u201ctaken aback\u201d during his meeting with Juncker last week at the scale and complexity of the potential problems on the border, and the extent to which Britain\u2019s sketchy ideas have failed to address them. In a speech in Madrid that went down like a lead balloon, Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay said the \u201cpurist\u201d EU would have to \u201ctake risks\u201d with the Irish border for a deal to be struck, demanding more flexibility and compromise from the bloc. The government said it would present its plans when it was ready, and then angered the EU27 by insisting that the papers it finally submitted \u2013 dismissed in Brussels as still \u201cvery far\u201d from what was required \u2013 must not be circulated. The EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, later described the British solution for replacing the backstop as unacceptable, adding that the UK government\u2019s position would have to change for there to be any hope of success. Meanwhile, the supreme court heard arguments in London for and against Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament until 14 October, including allegations that the mother of parliaments had been \u201cshut down by the father of lies\u201d and that the government\u2019s stated reasons for the prorogation were misleading. No 10 said it could not rule out proroguing parliament again if it loses the potentially explosive case, while the judges were urged to encourage the speakers of the Commons and Lords to reconvene the parliamentary session. The verdict should come on Tuesday morning (see below). As the prime minister headed to a UN climate summit in New York, where he was due to meet European leaders saying he was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d he could negotiate a deal with EU leaders, Labour continued to tear itself to pieces over its Brexit policy. Jeremy Corbyn wanted to \u201cstay neutral\u201d and let the people decide in a referendum; activists pushed for a campaign to remain; the party conference was plunged into Brexit disarray and then into downright chaos. In the end, Corbyn won: delegates rejected a motion that would have obliged Labour to adopt an out-and-out remain position before a general election. What next In the short term, all eyes are on the supreme court, whose verdict on whether Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament for five weeks was lawful or not is expected on Tuesday morning. A ruling against the government could trigger a \u201cconstitutional eruption of volcanic proportions\u201d, one legal expert said, with much depending on how the court framed such a decision \u2013 particularly if it determines that Johnson misled the Queen. Past that, the crucial problem facing the prime minister is whether or not he can solve the riddle of the Irish backstop and thus wring a deal from the EU (he would then have to get it through parliament, of course, but that\u2019s for another day). At the moment the two sides have starkly different visions of what the withdrawal agreement and the Irish protocol need to guarantee. Britain has proposed Northern Ireland stays under EU rules for agri-food but that otherwise there be two regulatory zones on the island, with some checks on goods necessary albeit facilitated by technology. The EU wants to secure full frictionless trade across the island in order to maintain the status quo. At present, there is little sign of any meaningful rapprochement. Best of the rest UK regions most exposed to no-deal Brexit also most deprived, warns study. Health cover for retired Britons in EU to last six months in no-deal Brexit. No-deal Brexit will have \u201cseismic\u201d impact, says European car industry. English people living in Wales tilted it towards Brexit, research finds. Arlene Foster signals DUP shift on Northern Ireland border issue. Interest rate cut more likely due to Brexit uncertainty, says Bank. No-deal Brexit will cut 3% off UK economic growth, says OECD. Hard Brexit would put officers\u2019 lives at risk, says Northern Ireland police chief. Importers stockpile alcohol for Christmas to avoid Brexit drought. Polish ambassador urges Poles to \u201cseriously consider\u201d leaving UK. Top comment In the Guardian, Jonathan Lis argues that the language of Brexit \u201cbetrayal\u201d is poisoning politics: Our fundamental problem is we have lost the ability to distinguish between compromise and betrayal. We now confront a situation in which language proves as dangerous as policy. Politicians can no longer merely disagree. They must be acting in bad faith, or subverting democracy, or betraying the electorate. This finds its extreme form in the word \u201ctreason\u201d, which now peppers and pollutes the language of rightwing politicians and commentators. But it has also insinuated itself into the way we address Brexit altogether. The essential toxin here is the requirement for political purity. This is partly driven by the increasing radicalism of our mainstream political parties and partly by the appetite for nationalism unleashed by the referendum and now rapidly advancing. Britain is no longer just riven politically and economically, but fully entrenched in a culture war which demands rigid and extreme conceptions of identity. This new polarisation necessitates an all-or-nothing stance not just on Brexit, but on politics altogether. When we join battle on those lines, we leave no room for anything in between or any obvious route to heal afterwards.

Slow Build, a 2017 <a href=\"https://nycfuture.org/pdf/CUF_Slow_Build.pdf\">report</a> by Centre for an Urban Future named Hunters Point library as an example of a project that \u201cgrew dramatically in scope and cost\u201d after being given the go-ahead.</p> <p>Last year a <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/bill-de-blasio-hunters-point-library-action-accountability\">petition</a>, signed by over 1,000 people called it \u201can embarrassment and a prime example of New York City government waste and inefficiency\u201d.</p> <p>Ian Michaels, a spokesperson for NYC Department of Design and Construction, said: \u201cIn January 2019, the city released its comprehensive plan to improve capital project delivery, which will make the system more streamlined and more efficient. Had that plan been in place, the library would have been done much more quickly. Hunters Point library would also be a candidate for Design-Build [a contracting method connecting designers and contractors], which New York City is advocating for strongly in Albany.\u201d</p> <p>But in Hunters Point, residents were excited about the opening. At a nearby play area, Luciana Santos, 31, who looks after two young children, had already looked at the library\u2019s events schedule.</p> <p>\u201cIt looks great \u2026 It took a while to get ready I think, but now everyone\u2019s excited for opening,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Reading a book nearby with her daughter, Laura Varland, 33, said she currently goes to Court Square library, which is about a mile away, but plans to switch allegiance to Hunters Point when it opens because it\u2019s closer to home.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful building,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s an architectural design. It\u2019s taken a while to be built, so we\u2019ve all been watching it with bated breath \u2026 and waiting for it to open, so we\u2019re excited that it\u2019s finally opening.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Strategically positioned on the bank of the East River, across the water from the United Nations headquarters, New York city has a shimmering new addition to its skylines. Unusually for such prime real estate set among parkland, panoramic views of Manhattan and convenient transport links, this $40m development in Queens is neither an upscale apartment block, exclusive members club or the offices of a huge corporation. In fact, it is the site of the city\u2019s newest public library. Built from aluminium-painted exposed concrete that sparkles in the light and featuring two huge freeform cutouts for windows, Hunters Point library, which opens on Tuesday on the Long Island City waterfront, is designed to be noticed from afar. As well as more than 50,000 books, including Spanish and Chinese collections, and a \u201ccyber center\u201d with computers, highlights include designer furniture by Eames and Jean Prouv\u00e9, an art installation by Julianne Swartz, an event space, a children\u2019s area and a \u201cquiet room\u201d. There is also a rooftop with tiered seating, an environmental education centre and a dedicated floor for teenagers with a video gaming area. The preliminary event schedule for adults includes trivia night, book, crocheting and writing clubs. \u201cIt\u2019s a beacon for the city,\u201d said Dennis Walcott, president and CEO of Queens Public library. \u201cIts location is just ideal both for the borough of Queens but as well as for New York City overall \u2026 Being located between two ferries gives the opportunity for people to come over, visit and relax and surrounded by parkland as well. So it\u2019s a beautiful place for what libraries are about in today\u2019s society.\u201d The opening of Hunters Point \u2013 the early design of which was reached by Steven Holl Architects in 2010, with construction starting in 2015 \u2013 is being seen as a positive sign for the health of New York libraries, and has been largely welcomed by the community despite some criticism over its price tag. When it opens today, it will become the 217th in New York, where libraries attract a total of 37.7 million people per year. In Queens, one of America\u2019s largest public library services, Walcott says none of the borough\u2019s residents lives more than approximately one mile away from a library. But in the age of Donald Trump, whose administration has proposed budget cuts that would close the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), the government agency that gives grants to libraries and museums, the high-profile opening is a political statement, too. While most library funding comes from local sources, American Libraries Association (ALA) spokesperson Shawnda Hines said federal money is still \u201cvital\u201d for their survival. \u201cFor three years in a row, the Trump administration has threatened to eliminate IMLS altogether,\u201d she said. \u201cObviously libraries are more important than ever under Donald Trump, who is assaulting our sense of decency and who has sought to dismantle the civic space and stability as we knew it,\u201d said Jimmy Van Bramer, local council member and chairman of New York City Council\u2019s cultural affairs and libraries committee. He said Americans should respond to Trump by improving their libraries and other spaces where \u201cpeople can come together, talk, meet and actually defend their democracy and their neighborhoods\u201d. Despite increased internet access and growing distractions, libraries have proven remarkably resilient in the US, adapting their services to the changing needs of communities. Next year, libraries are expected to play a central role in the US census when, for the first time ever, it will be available online. According to the latest Public Libraries Survey report, published by the IMLS in May, although library funding across the US improved in the three years leading up to 2016, it remained below pre-recession levels. Meanwhile, visits remain relatively high. In 2016, there were 1.35bn visits to public libraries. This compares to 1.39bn the previous year. It\u2019s in stark contrast to Britain, where last year nearly 130 public libraries closed. \u201cNo one would have predicted 30 years ago that of all the public institutions we have, the library would be the most adept at transforming to meet needs of contemporary citizens. But it has,\u201d said Eric Klinenberg, director of the Institute for Public Knowledge at New York University and author of Palaces for the People. Hunters Point, he said, is a reminder of the potential of public architecture. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to depend on tech firms and star architects to have beautiful buildings.\u201d Citing Oodi, in Helsinki, Finland, the current star of the library world, Central library in Calgary, Canada, and, in the US, Austin Central library in Texas and the library systems in Columbus, Ohio, Seattle and Chicago, he said \u201cthere are a lot of great libraries\u201d, but that America could still do better. \u201cThe American public library system is truly special by international standards. But that\u2019s only because we\u2019ve inherited a tremendous gift from the generations that have come before us and for the most part what we\u2019ve been doing is squandering our inheritance.\u201d There has been some criticism of the project, however. Slow Build, a 2017 report by Centre for an Urban Future named Hunters Point library as an example of a project that \u201cgrew dramatically in scope and cost\u201d after being given the go-ahead. Last year a petition, signed by over 1,000 people called it \u201can embarrassment and a prime example of New York City government waste and inefficiency\u201d. Ian Michaels, a spokesperson for NYC Department of Design and Construction, said: \u201cIn January 2019, the city released its comprehensive plan to improve capital project delivery, which will make the system more streamlined and more efficient. Had that plan been in place, the library would have been done much more quickly. Hunters Point library would also be a candidate for Design-Build [a contracting method connecting designers and contractors], which New York City is advocating for strongly in Albany.\u201d But in Hunters Point, residents were excited about the opening. At a nearby play area, Luciana Santos, 31, who looks after two young children, had already looked at the library\u2019s events schedule. \u201cIt looks great \u2026 It took a while to get ready I think, but now everyone\u2019s excited for opening,\u201d she said. Reading a book nearby with her daughter, Laura Varland, 33, said she currently goes to Court Square library, which is about a mile away, but plans to switch allegiance to Hunters Point when it opens because it\u2019s closer to home. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful building,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s an architectural design. It\u2019s taken a while to be built, so we\u2019ve all been watching it with bated breath \u2026 and waiting for it to open, so we\u2019re excited that it\u2019s finally opening.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "\u201cNo, you are.\u201d Since he first emerged from the primordial muck of reality TV, Donald Trump has responded to attacks from political opponents with some version of that playground phrase. When accused of this, or revealed to have done that, Trump simply blurts \u201cshe did it\u201d or \u201che\u2019s guilty\u201d, whatever the charge may be. And with \u2013 impressive? \u2013 regularity, the tactic seems to work at shifting the broader framing of the story, through a mix of media repetition, Republican complicity, credulous reporting and debunking efforts that nevertheless end up repeating Trump\u2019s claims. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump accused Hillary Clinton of being an accomplice to sexual assault, a racist, a \u201cbirther\u201d, a secret ally to Russia and a dilettante \u201crunning a policy-free campaign\u201d offering \u201conly hatred and division\u201d. Trump partially succeeded in turning Robert Mueller\u2019s special counsel investigation of alleged obstruction of justice by him into an expos\u00e9 of his own political opponents. After being accused in July of using racist language to describe Representative Elijah Cummings\u2019 Baltimore district, Trump called Cummings, who is black, \u201cracist\u201d. Now Trump is the subject of a complaint by an intelligence community whistleblower that Trump pressured a foreign leader for information that could be used to harm former vice-president Joe Biden, who leads Trump by double digits in polling averages. On its face, the report would appear to be a serious liability for Trump, exposing him as wielding the diplomatic power of the presidency to keep himself in office, which is definitely not what democracy looks like. Trump\u2019s response? Boy, Joe Biden has really double-crossed America this time. Trump is seeking to turn the affair against Biden by peddling a conspiracy theory about a Ukrainian prosecution of a Ukrainian energy company on whose board Hunter Biden, the politician\u2019s son, formerly sat. The theory has been thoroughly debunked . That has not stopped the Republican National Committee from producing a \u201cfact\u201d page, titled \u201cQuid Pro Joe\u201d, repeating Trump\u2019s headline claims, in the latest illustration of how completely the party has given itself over to the president. Nor have Republican leaders stepped forward to censure Trump. But equally important to the success of Trump\u2019s scheme is the active role of rightwing media, which, with Fox News executives having cycled in and out of the White House and the former press secretary now an employee of Fox News, clearly does not require any active, story-by-story coordination. The news outlet Axios highlighted the national ideological split-screen on the Trump-Ukraine story as it played this weekend: The big question attached to Trump\u2019s tactic is whether it will generate enough talk about \u201cBiden\u201d and \u201ccorruption\u201d to dilute the reported new evidence of Trump\u2019s corruption, as laid out in the whistleblower complaint, which the administration has refused to turn over to Congress. The question could have historic consequences, given the surge in demand among Democrats, who control the House of Representatives, for Trump\u2019s impeachment over the matter. Interviewed by the Associated Press about Trump\u2019s projection of his own faults on his opponents during the last presidential cycle, longtime Republican operative Tucker Martin said the tactic is known to work. \u201cEssentially you\u2019re delegitimizing their attack by simply muddying the water, and saying, \u2018We\u2019re all guilty, now what?\u2019\u201d Martin told AP. Other commentators, including Jonathan Chait writing in New York magazine, have noted that \u201cthe inexhaustible fire hose of Trumpian misconduct\u201d has ironically made wild counter-attacks by him a low-risk strategy, since most people have already made up their minds about him. \u201cTrump\u2019s base is almost immune to news of misconduct by him, while the Democratic base is highly sensitive to it,\u201d wrote Chait. \u201cIt\u2019s therefore plausible for Trump to assume that a story that combines unsubstantiated allegations against people in his opponent\u2019s orbit with massive, undisguised abuse of power by Trump himself is a net win.\u201d Bolstering Trump\u2019s image-maintenance accomplices in the media and Congress are those power-holders closest to him, including the vice-president and members of the cabinet, some of whom have matched Trump himself for turning substantial and alarming allegations into ugly and spearheaded counter-attacks. In an appearance on CBS News\u2019 Face the Nation program on Sunday, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, was asked whether it was \u201cappropriate\u201d for Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who for months has been Trump\u2019s man on the ground in Ukraine, to call for an investigation of Biden, as Giuliani has done. \u201cIf there was election interference that took place by the vice-president,\u201d Pompeo replied, \u201cI think the American people deserve to know.\u201d",

I was mortified,\u201d she recalls. \u201cLetting people know you are shy or nervous can help them understand your needs and behaviour.\u201d You could also seek out student-run groups linked to mental health charities that are open to anyone feeling lonely or depressed. Ellen Dean, president of the Student Minds group at the University of Kent\u2019s Canterbury campus, says some universities have only limited support for students with mental health conditions, and groups such as hers can advise on getting help. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to latch on to anybody just to notch up friends. Reach out to people who will know what you are going through,\u201d says Dean, who is studying English, American literature and creative writing. \u201cI hung out with a group of people I didn\u2019t really like, doing things I didn\u2019t really enjoy. You do have to push yourself, but it doesn\u2019t have to be the big night out.\u201d",

Some stores are traditional in style, with sliding screen doors, tatami mats and tranquil gardens; others are tiny modern boutiques. Inside they sell not just beautifully made jeans but shirts, jackets, skirts, coats, aprons and wallets. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c8f51ce01c8093f51a8bc747d0d457187a756001\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8f51ce01c8093f51a8bc747d0d457187a756001/0_362_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeans sign on corner, Kojima Jeans Street, Japan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">No crowds, no neon lights\u2026</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Okayama Prefectural Tourism Federation</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b13ec0279c956c6b238e25fec0ca8af3c453d10\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b13ec0279c956c6b238e25fec0ca8af3c453d10/0_0_4898_3265/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manhole cover with Kojima Jeans Street on it\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Denim in Japan is a legacy of the US occupation during the second world war.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Okayama Prefectural Tourism Federation</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To understand why one of the country\u2019s most intriguing shopping experiences is in a small, unassuming town in Okayama prefecture, you have to rewind a few decades \u2013 to postwar Japan.

The first Japanese denim company chose the most American-sounding name it could come up with: Big John. And then it did the same for its women\u2019s brand: Betty Smith. Initially, Big John used denim fabric and sewing machines imported from the US, but in the 1970s it started to produce its own denim using old shuttle looms and traditional indigo-dyeing techniques \u2013 and Japanese jeans were born.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--halfWidth\"> <blockquote> <p>Big John is the godfather of Japanese denim, and is still a much-loved brand</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"a9999e62feaf54a8ee94cfc6b911d73586d7976b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9999e62feaf54a8ee94cfc6b911d73586d7976b/0_0_1536_2048/750.jpg\" alt=\"School uniform on display at the Betty Smith Museum, Kojima, Okayama Prefecture, Japan\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">School uniform on display at the Betty Smith Museum, Kojima, Okayama Prefecture, Japan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Isabel Choat</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Big John is still going strong and, as the godfather of Japanese denim, is still a much-loved brand.

The smaller boutiques, with their minimal clothes rails, were easier to navigate and more soothing. I loved Apple Do, a neat little store with beautifully made jeans, shirts and, most covetable of all, denim coats.

      "bodyText": "In a country where craftsmanship is so highly prized, it\u2019s no surprise to learn that even a product as universal as jeans has been raised to an art form. Thanks to traditional production methods that create high-quality, long-lasting jeans, Japanese denim has iconic status among \u201cconnoisseur denim heads\u201d, who are prepared to pay \u00a3250 or more for a pair. Major Japanese brands, such as Momotoro, Pure Blue Japan and Studio d\u2019Artisan, all have stores in the big cities, but arguably the best \u2013 and certainly the most interesting \u2013 place to buy jeans in Japan is hundreds of kilometres away from Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka, in a sleepy coastal district on the southern coast of Honshu, the biggest of the four main islands. The 38 stores vary hugely in style. An hour\u2019s train ride south of Okayama city, Jeans Street in the port town of Kojima is a hub of 38 specialist denim shops. The \u201cstreet\u201d is actually four streets \u2013 each strung with lines of jeans as if someone has just hung them out to dry. Shopping here couldn\u2019t be further from the big city experience of Japan \u2013 there are no crowds, no neon lights, no department stores and no subcultures on display. I strolled near-empty streets, and browsed quiet shops where I was left in peace to look around. More than just a retail experience, Jeans Street is a homage to denim, with the hard-wearing blue fabric referenced in everything from vending machines to drain covers and signs to public loos. Some stores are traditional in style, with sliding screen doors, tatami mats and tranquil gardens; others are tiny modern boutiques. Inside they sell not just beautifully made jeans but shirts, jackets, skirts, coats, aprons and wallets. To understand why one of the country\u2019s most intriguing shopping experiences is in a small, unassuming town in Okayama prefecture, you have to rewind a few decades \u2013 to postwar Japan. One of the side-effects of the US occupation during the second world war was an obsession with Americana among Japanese youth, who embraced American pop culture and created a healthy black market in used Levi\u2019s and Lee jeans.

I loved Apple Do, a neat little store with beautifully made jeans, shirts and, most covetable of all, denim coats. I was welcomed by a smiling shop assistant who, dressed from head to toe in denim, was the epitome of Japanese style. I wanted everything in the shop, but resisted, knowing I could never pull off the double \u2013 or triple \u2013 denim look. I was in danger of trailing in and out of most of the 38 shops and leaving empty-handed. So I determined to get a pair of jeans in the next shop I saw: Momotaro.

      "body": "<h2>Top story: PM says he won\u2019t resign if ruling goes against him</h2> \n<p>Good morning and welcome to this Tuesday briefing with Alison Rourke.</p> \n<p>This morning the UK\u2019s highest court will give its historic ruling on the legality of the five-week suspension of parliament. Boris Johnson, who is in New York for a UN summit, has refused to rule out proroguing parliament again if the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/23/boris-johnson-refuses-to-rule-out-suspending-parliament-again\">supreme court rules he abused his powers as PM</a>. He has also indicated he would not feel obliged to resign in that scenario: \u201cI think the reasons for wanting a Queen\u2019s speech are extremely good,\u201d he said \u2013 the reason he gave for proroguing parliament. The court of 11 judges has heard his move was designed to prevent scrutiny over Brexit.</p> \n<p>In what will be a busy day for the PM, Johnson will deliver a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/23/johnson-hints-at-major-reforms-to-tax-and-industry-post-brexit\">set-piece Brexit speech</a> in New York today, during which he will promise that a post-Brexit UK would \u201croll out the red carpet\u201d for US businesses with \u201cthe most competitive tax rates and the best skilled workforce in the hemisphere\u201d.</p> \n<p>He will also have to deal with escalating tensions over Iran. Yesterday Johnson sided with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/23/saudi-arabia-iran-france-germany-uk\">Donald Trump in calling the 2015 nuclear agreement with Tehran </a>a \u201cbad deal\u201d, while praising the US president as a \u201cvery brilliant negotiator\u201d capable of achieving a better deal. His remarks marked a sharp change in UK rhetoric, but British officials insisted that Johnson continued to support full compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal. What was clear was the PM\u2019s intention to emphasise his personal relationship with Trump: \u201cI think there\u2019s one guy who can do a better deal and one guy who understands how to get a difficult partner like Iran over the line and that is the president of the United States,\u201d he said. Iran, meanwhile, ruled out the possibility of negotiating a new deal with major powers. The country\u2019s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said in a tweet that European partners had failed to fulfil their commitments under the 2015 nuclear pact.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Thomas Cook </strong>\u2013 Thousands more stranded passengers will be repatriated today amid accusations the government sealed the company\u2019s fate by turning down its request for financial support to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/23/squadrons-start-flying-150000-thomas-cook-customers-back-to-uk\">help tide it over the winter</a>. Claims have emerged that the Spanish and Turkish governments had offered to help save the stricken tour operator, only for the deal to disintegrate due to a lack of support in Westminster. Meanwhile, the company\u2019s executives <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/23/hedge-funds-win-big-from-short-selling-thomas-cook-shares\">faced criticism for multimillion-pound pay</a> deals in recent years. The firm\u2019s last three chief executives took home combined pay packages \u2013 including bonuses \u2013 worth more than \u00a335m in the past 12 years, triggering calls from the Labour party for the bosses to return their windfalls. And what of the scale of the repatriation operation? The Civil Aviation Authority <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/23/how-secret-plans-saved-customers-of-thomas-cook-from-being-stranded\">has spent millions creating a pop-up airline to bring people home</a>, in Operation Matterhorn.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Labour conference</strong> \u2013 Delegates will be asked to vote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/24/labour-unveils-83bn-state-windfarms-plan-before-key-climate-vote\">today on the target to cut the UK\u2019s carbon emissions to net zero</a>. Two motions will be put to members, one with a target of net zero carbon emissions by 2030 \u2013 which would be much more stringent than the government\u2019s current target of net zero by 2050 \u2013 and one backed by the GMB union, which does not set a date. The 2030 motion came from the pressure group Labour for a Green New Deal and has the support of several smaller unions. Confusingly<strong>,</strong> both motions could pass. The party leadership is focusing its efforts on the \u201cgreen industrial revolution\u201d, its strategy for reviving the economy, creating high-quality jobs and tackling the climate emergency. It will promise to build dozens of new state-owned offshore windfarms, at a cost of \u00a383bn in public and private money. The debate on emissions comes after delegates on Monday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/23/jeremy-corbyn-defeats-grassroots-motion-for-out-and-out-remain-campaign-brexit\">rejected a call for Labour to take a clear anti-Brexit stance </a>before a general election. Corbyn has made clear that he would prefer to defer the decision about which side Labour would take in a referendum, until after any vote. But as John Crace writes, the battle over the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/23/labour-elite-wins-a-battle-but-it-might-have-just-lost-the-war\">party\u2019s position on Brexit was such a shambles</a>, it may just have ensured Labour will lose the war.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>\u2018How dare you\u2019</strong>\u2013 Greta Thunberg delivered an emotional and stirring speech to the UN yesterday, in which she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/23/greta-thunberg-speech-un-2019-address\">condemned world leaders for their inertia over global heating</a>, and criticised what she called a \u201cbetrayal\u201d of young people (\u201cYou are failing us \u2026 how dare you\u201d). President Trump l<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/24/she-seems-very-happy-trump-appears-to-mock-greta-thunbergs-emotional-speech\">ater appeared to mock her</a> when he tweeted she \u201cseemed like a very happy young girl\u201d. Thunberg\u2019s impassioned plea for action came amid new analysis that has shown that more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/24/most-of-worlds-biggest-firms-unlikely-to-meet-paris-climate-targets\">80% of the world\u2019s largest companies are unlikely</a> to meet the Paris agreement targets by 2050. A study of almost 3,000 publicly listed companies found that just 18% have disclosed plans that are aligned with goals to limit rising temperatures to 1.5C of pre-industrialised levels by the middle of the century. The report, by investment data provider Arabesque S-Ray, found more than a third of the world\u2019s top 200 companies still do not disclose their greenhouse gas emissions. The firm\u2019s chief executive, Andreas Feiner, said companies \u201cmay appear to be taking steps to reduce their impact on climate change\u201d but many are choosing to keep the full scale of their emissions under wraps to avoid losing investment.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"64d703e8-e2c7-442d-acad-cb0ef1381c6c\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TMrtLsQbaok?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Philby\u2019s secrets</strong> \u2013 Extracts from Kim Philby\u2019s official <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/24/confession-of-british-spy-for-the-soviets-kim-philby-made-public-for-first-time\">1963 confession to the UK\u2019s security services</a> have been made public for the first time.

      "bodyText": "Top story: PM says he won\u2019t resign if ruling goes against him Good morning and welcome to this Tuesday briefing with Alison Rourke. This morning the UK\u2019s highest court will give its historic ruling on the legality of the five-week suspension of parliament. Boris Johnson, who is in New York for a UN summit, has refused to rule out proroguing parliament again if the supreme court rules he abused his powers as PM. He has also indicated he would not feel obliged to resign in that scenario: \u201cI think the reasons for wanting a Queen\u2019s speech are extremely good,\u201d he said \u2013 the reason he gave for proroguing parliament. The court of 11 judges has heard his move was designed to prevent scrutiny over Brexit. In what will be a busy day for the PM, Johnson will deliver a set-piece Brexit speech in New York today, during which he will promise that a post-Brexit UK would \u201croll out the red carpet\u201d for US businesses with \u201cthe most competitive tax rates and the best skilled workforce in the hemisphere\u201d. He will also have to deal with escalating tensions over Iran. Yesterday Johnson sided with Donald Trump in calling the 2015 nuclear agreement with Tehran a \u201cbad deal\u201d, while praising the US president as a \u201cvery brilliant negotiator\u201d capable of achieving a better deal. His remarks marked a sharp change in UK rhetoric, but British officials insisted that Johnson continued to support full compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal. What was clear was the PM\u2019s intention to emphasise his personal relationship with Trump: \u201cI think there\u2019s one guy who can do a better deal and one guy who understands how to get a difficult partner like Iran over the line and that is the president of the United States,\u201d he said. Iran, meanwhile, ruled out the possibility of negotiating a new deal with major powers. The country\u2019s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said in a tweet that European partners had failed to fulfil their commitments under the 2015 nuclear pact. * * * Thomas Cook \u2013 Thousands more stranded passengers will be repatriated today amid accusations the government sealed the company\u2019s fate by turning down its request for financial support to help tide it over the winter. Claims have emerged that the Spanish and Turkish governments had offered to help save the stricken tour operator, only for the deal to disintegrate due to a lack of support in Westminster. Meanwhile, the company\u2019s executives faced criticism for multimillion-pound pay deals in recent years. The firm\u2019s last three chief executives took home combined pay packages \u2013 including bonuses \u2013 worth more than \u00a335m in the past 12 years, triggering calls from the Labour party for the bosses to return their windfalls. And what of the scale of the repatriation operation? The Civil Aviation Authority has spent millions creating a pop-up airline to bring people home, in Operation Matterhorn. * * * Labour conference \u2013 Delegates will be asked to vote today on the target to cut the UK\u2019s carbon emissions to net zero. Two motions will be put to members, one with a target of net zero carbon emissions by 2030 \u2013 which would be much more stringent than the government\u2019s current target of net zero by 2050 \u2013 and one backed by the GMB union, which does not set a date. The 2030 motion came from the pressure group Labour for a Green New Deal and has the support of several smaller unions. Confusingly, both motions could pass. The party leadership is focusing its efforts on the \u201cgreen industrial revolution\u201d, its strategy for reviving the economy, creating high-quality jobs and tackling the climate emergency. It will promise to build dozens of new state-owned offshore windfarms, at a cost of \u00a383bn in public and private money. The debate on emissions comes after delegates on Monday rejected a call for Labour to take a clear anti-Brexit stance before a general election. Corbyn has made clear that he would prefer to defer the decision about which side Labour would take in a referendum, until after any vote. But as John Crace writes, the battle over the party\u2019s position on Brexit was such a shambles, it may just have ensured Labour will lose the war. * * * \u2018How dare you\u2019\u2013 Greta Thunberg delivered an emotional and stirring speech to the UN yesterday, in which she condemned world leaders for their inertia over global heating, and criticised what she called a \u201cbetrayal\u201d of young people (\u201cYou are failing us \u2026 how dare you\u201d). President Trump later appeared to mock her when he tweeted she \u201cseemed like a very happy young girl\u201d. Thunberg\u2019s impassioned plea for action came amid new analysis that has shown that more than 80% of the world\u2019s largest companies are unlikely to meet the Paris agreement targets by 2050. A study of almost 3,000 publicly listed companies found that just 18% have disclosed plans that are aligned with goals to limit rising temperatures to 1.5C of pre-industrialised levels by the middle of the century. The report, by investment data provider Arabesque S-Ray, found more than a third of the world\u2019s top 200 companies still do not disclose their greenhouse gas emissions. The firm\u2019s chief executive, Andreas Feiner, said companies \u201cmay appear to be taking steps to reduce their impact on climate change\u201d but many are choosing to keep the full scale of their emissions under wraps to avoid losing investment. * * * Philby\u2019s secrets \u2013 Extracts from Kim Philby\u2019s official 1963 confession to the UK\u2019s security services have been made public for the first time. Philby, one of the Soviet Union\u2019s most notorious British cold war spies, fled to Moscow shortly after his 1963 admission of guilt. Philby, who while a double agent at one time headed up counter-espionage operations for MI6, explained that joining the Soviet secret police (OGPU) did not mean he agreed unquestioningly with everything they did. \u201cNone of the OGPU officials with whom I had dealings ever attempted to win my total acceptance on the technical level,\u201d he said. The extracts \u2013 the latest to be released from MI5 files \u2013 begin with the rendezvous in the London park, with the man who would become Philby\u2019s handler, Arnold Deutsch, known to the Briton only as \u201cOtto\u201d. Other newly declassified papers suggest that the Portland spy ring, an infamous Soviet group, exposed in 1961, that passed on admiralty documents, including information on Britain\u2019s first nuclear submarine, could have been stopped four years earlier. * * * Line of Duty \u2013 The Metropolitan police commissioner, Cressida Dick, has expressed her \u201coutrage\u201d over plots in the hit TV series. \u201cI was absolutely outraged by the level of casual and extreme corruption that was being portrayed as the way the police is in 2018\u201319. It\u2019s so far from that,\u201d said Dick in an interview with the Radio Times.

But Dick did concede that both shows could ultimately do the police good, by making the police force \u201c look a bit cool and interesting \u2013 a net positive, probably,\u201d she said.

      "bodyText": "Greens councillors have seized on advice that federal rules mandating citizenship ceremonies on Australia Day may be unlawful, calling on the Local Government Association to consider legal action. Tim Walker, of Launceston council, and Bill Harvey, of Hobart council, told Guardian Australia the local government peak body should consider acting on the view of the academic Kim Rubenstein to advance the campaign to change the date of Australia\u2019s national holiday. On Friday the immigration minister, David Coleman, released a new code governing citizenship ceremonies, requiring councils to hold them on 26 January, despite a growing number of councils seeking to avoid the date out of respect for Indigenous Australians who note it commemorates the invasion of Australia. The Turnbull government sought to suppress the movement by banning Yarra and Darebin councils in Melbourne from holding citizenship ceremonies through special regulations. Unlike those regulations, the new code is not disallowable by the Senate, allowing the executive to set rules for ceremonies without oversight from the parliament. On Tuesday, Rubenstein questioned whether that could put the code in breach of the Australian Citizenship Act, which requires citizenship pledges to be governed by arrangements prescribed in regulations. \u201cIf they\u2019ve just added in this policy that says \u2018if you\u2019re going to change Australia Day, we will consider not authorising you to have these ceremonies\u2019, then there are real questions around whether the code is properly made within the terms of the act,\u201d Rubenstein told The Australian. Rubenstein questioned whether the federal government is using policy to \u201cregulate when Australia Day is\u201d and \u201cprevent councils from the raising of the political issue of when Australia Day should be\u201d which could be outside the purpose of the Act. \u201cIn a more extreme sense, is that restriction on councils a breach of the implied freedom of political communication, which is a constitutional principle? \u201cThe only way we would know is if one of the local councils went ahead and said \u2018we\u2019re going to do this anyway\u2019 and then, when the government revoked their power to hold citizenship ceremonies, that council would have the ability to challenge that decision.\u201d Harvey said Hobart council had been deterred from moving its ceremonies from 26 January by advice warning the home affairs department could refuse to send it the names of new citizens, preventing it holding any ceremonies. He noted the Local Government Association had passed a motion in 2017 encouraging councils to consider efforts they could take to lobby the federal government to change the date. \u201cYes, I think they should have a look [at the lawfulness of the code]. If they\u2019ve got the resources they should challenge it,\u201d he said. Walker said Launceston council had unanimously supported refusing to hold citizenship ceremonies on 26 January but now accepts that the \u201cchurlish\u201d threat to remove its right to hold ceremonies means \u201cif it is mandated, we would continue to hold them on 26 January\u201d. Walker welcomed Rubenstein\u2019s contribution, suggesting that the legal argument is one part of a broader campaign for \u201ccultural justice\u201d and \u201cthe federal government will find they are on the wrong side of history, if they have to force people to celebrate a day they find offensive\u201d. Walker accused the LGA of passing the resolution then \u201csitting on it\u201d, suggesting it \u201cmay be appropriate\u201d for it to bring a legal challenge. A spokesman for the LGA rejected the calls, suggesting any potential legal challenges were \u201ca matter for individual councils\u201d. The Greens immigration spokesman, Nick McKim, said the Coalition is \u201ctrying to work around parliament to override the decisions of democratically elected councils\u201d. \u201cAll over the country, local councils are having important conversations with First Nations people about how to make ceremonies more inclusive and representative,\u201d he said. \u201cIf local councils decide not to conduct citizenship ceremonies on January 26, then that should be the end of the matter.\u201d A spokeswoman for Coleman said the code is a \u201cpolicy document which outlines the requirements for Australian citizenship ceremonies\u201d and did not respond to questions about whether it is appropriate for these to be outside regulations.",

      "bodyText": "Euphoria 10.10pm, Sky Atlantic The cult American teen drama reaches a suitably intense and thrilling climax with that most anticipated of US high-school events: the formal. Corsages, limos and gowns at the ready, the finale finds the relationship between Rue (played with expert dazed lethargy by Zendaya) and Jules getting rockier by the minute, with the option of skipping town tantalisingly close, while all the teens must come to terms with their long-held secrets. A neon-soaked, suitably murky trip to end a debut season of must-watch TV. Ammar Kalia The Great British Bake Off 8pm, Channel 4 There is no use crying over spilt milk so, with Dairy Week over, the bakers turn their attention to another new theme, namely creations inspired by the 1920s. First up, it is custard pies (not the clown sort), before a classically tricky technical creation and some barnstorming, booze-inspired showstoppers. Hannah J Davies The Capture 9pm, BBC One This tense and timely surveillance thriller continues to ask the right questions about the increasingly compromised relationship between CCTV and what was once fondly known as the truth. Tonight, DI Rachel Carey finally comes face to face with a fugitive. But will any answers be forthcoming? Phil Harrison Live: The Circle 9.15pm, Channel 4 Sure, Love Island is fun, but isn\u2019t there something old-fashioned about face-to-face dating and being who you say you are? This social media-based show provides us indoor types with a \u201creality\u201d full of snaky moves and cutesy face filters, while new host Emma Willis invites further audience interaction. Ellen E Jones Defending the Guilty 10pm, BBC Two It is law and order with a heavy helping of dry sarcasm in this new comedy series from Cuckoo writer Kieron Quirke, which follows an idealistic trainee barrister as he has his career motives put to the test by his cynical pupil master Caroline (Katherine Parkinson).

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s dark in here and distant traffic can be heard thundering overhead. Mark Leckey has turned some of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/sep/23/concrete-art-mark-leckey-m53-motorway-bridge-at-tate-britain\">ground floor </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/sep/23/concrete-art-mark-leckey-m53-motorway-bridge-at-tate-britain\">galleries at Tate Britain</a> into a single open space, transforming it into a life-sized mock-up of a motorway underpass in the Wirral, over which thrums the M53 traffic. There\u2019s a concrete ramp and pillars \u2013 and the skylights have partially obscured by the supposed underside of the motorway bridge. This is Leckey\u2019s O\u2019 Magic Power of Bleakness, which presents this new work, called Under Under <em>In</em>, alongside two earlier videos: 1999\u2019s Fiorucci Made Me Hardcore, and Dream English Kid 1964-1999 AD, from 2015.</p> <p>The motorway bridge, which appeared in Dream English Kid, is more than just a stage setting. Growing up close by, Leckey remembers it as a place of mystery as well as escape for neighbourhood kids, a feral no man\u2019s land \u2013 and a portal to another world. A familiar trope in children\u2019s literature \u2013 from CS Lewis to Alan Garner, JK Rowling and Philip Pullman \u2013 the prosaic entrance to an unseen world, a flaw in the fabric of reality, is an enduring fantasy. Leckey experienced something here, and it hasn\u2019t gone away.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6008c18dfa7570cfc2b9ec10abb45a3ac6bb619f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6008c18dfa7570cfc2b9ec10abb45a3ac6bb619f/306_210_3125_1875/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Far away in space and time \u2026 O\u2019 Magic Power of Bleakness.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Far away in space and time \u2026 O\u2019 Magic Power of Bleakness.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nils Jorgensen/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The kids in Leckey\u2019s M53 Plato\u2019s Cave are first spotted high on the ramp, far above us and just beneath the road above. Distant, and shot in black and white, they are far away both in space and time. On a number of smaller screens, at ground level, we see them in their hoodies and balaclavas, their spookiness undercut by Adidas logos. The kids are all right, scaring each other as kids always do. \u201cYou\u2019re away with the fairies, Mark!\u201d someone shouts, in this 50-minute melange of new work and old, all folded together into something that is both haunted house and house music rave, journey into the past and premonition of the future. Leckey is having fun in this captivating and strange world.</p> <p>The motorway bridge, another kid tells us, was built on an old straight track, and we are plunged, onscreen, into successive undercrofts, filled with monoliths and neolithic chambers. It is a supernatural riot down here. The lights go on and off, spotlights sheer the gloom, and a dull sodium pallor casts the concrete, and us, a sickly yellow.</p> <p>Leckey\u2019s work is like a time machine. I hear the grinding of the Tardis\u2019s gears, and see shadows on the wall, and a little boy playing alone in a winter garden. Maybe it is Leckey himself. Maybe we are meant to think so. I hear, too, the echo of old advertising jingles. The smiling face of Tony the Tiger from the Kellogg\u2019s Frosties ad (\u201cThey\u2019re grrrreat!!!\u201d) floats by. Carry On star Liz Fraser is doing her makeup and the carpet\u2019s all swirly. These and other product placements pitch us back to the 1960s in Leckey\u2019s mix of old TV and movie footage, amateur film shot at dancehalls, raves and northern soul gigs. Flares are flapping, fags are lit, the dancefloor\u2019s heaving.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f23becc225c42bfe15d4a259fa649df2826ec29f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f23becc225c42bfe15d4a259fa649df2826ec29f/0_120_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Weird lighting \u2026 O\u2019 Magic Power of Bleakness.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Weird lighting \u2026 O\u2019 Magic Power of Bleakness.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nils Jorgensen/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>O\u2019 Magic Power of Bleakness is an invocation of childhood and youth, but also a picture of a period, of the modernity of motorways and 60s shopping precincts, of three-day weeks and Liverpool under Thatcherism, of the Mersey beat and Madchester, Joy Division gigs and leaden pianos accompanying muffled Sunday choirs. The four-to-the-floor beats, Ian Curtis\u2019s on-stage manic gyrations and ravers dancing on E carry us along down our own rivers of memory.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/mar/26/how-mark-leckey-became-the-artist-of-the-youtube-generation\">Leckey is in there somewhere, reliving his past</a>. Although he never planned it this way, the two earlier works projected large on a plain wall fit seamlessly. Childhood wonders and terrors (what lurks beneath the underpass? Did something die here?) and the possibility of escape through a youth culture that hadn\u2019t entirely been monetised even in the 1980s, make a potent mix.</p> <p>O\u2019 Magic Power of Bleakness is all about escape routes, real and imaginary, and their impossibility. If the show is a kind of Bildungsroman, and a homage to the music he loves, it is also a sideways nod to the fact that Leckey made his own escape, in the days before student loans and the capitalisation of higher education, into art. Romanticism runs through Leckey\u2019s work, but it is leavened by a strong, prickly, necessary streak of realism.</p>",

Mark Leckey has turned some of the ground floor galleries at Tate Britain into a single open space, transforming it into a life-sized mock-up of a motorway underpass in the Wirral, over which thrums the M53 traffic. There\u2019s a concrete ramp and pillars \u2013 and the skylights have partially obscured by the supposed underside of the motorway bridge. This is Leckey\u2019s O\u2019 Magic Power of Bleakness, which presents this new work, called Under Under In, alongside two earlier videos: 1999\u2019s Fiorucci Made Me Hardcore, and Dream English Kid 1964-1999 AD, from 2015. The motorway bridge, which appeared in Dream English Kid, is more than just a stage setting. Growing up close by, Leckey remembers it as a place of mystery as well as escape for neighbourhood kids, a feral no man\u2019s land \u2013 and a portal to another world. A familiar trope in children\u2019s literature \u2013 from CS Lewis to Alan Garner, JK Rowling and Philip Pullman \u2013 the prosaic entrance to an unseen world, a flaw in the fabric of reality, is an enduring fantasy. Leckey experienced something here, and it hasn\u2019t gone away. The kids in Leckey\u2019s M53 Plato\u2019s Cave are first spotted high on the ramp, far above us and just beneath the road above. Distant, and shot in black and white, they are far away both in space and time. On a number of smaller screens, at ground level, we see them in their hoodies and balaclavas, their spookiness undercut by Adidas logos. The kids are all right, scaring each other as kids always do. \u201cYou\u2019re away with the fairies, Mark!\u201d someone shouts, in this 50-minute melange of new work and old, all folded together into something that is both haunted house and house music rave, journey into the past and premonition of the future. Leckey is having fun in this captivating and strange world. The motorway bridge, another kid tells us, was built on an old straight track, and we are plunged, onscreen, into successive undercrofts, filled with monoliths and neolithic chambers. It is a supernatural riot down here. The lights go on and off, spotlights sheer the gloom, and a dull sodium pallor casts the concrete, and us, a sickly yellow. Leckey\u2019s work is like a time machine. I hear the grinding of the Tardis\u2019s gears, and see shadows on the wall, and a little boy playing alone in a winter garden. Maybe it is Leckey himself. Maybe we are meant to think so. I hear, too, the echo of old advertising jingles. The smiling face of Tony the Tiger from the Kellogg\u2019s Frosties ad (\u201cThey\u2019re grrrreat!!!\u201d) floats by. Carry On star Liz Fraser is doing her makeup and the carpet\u2019s all swirly. These and other product placements pitch us back to the 1960s in Leckey\u2019s mix of old TV and movie footage, amateur film shot at dancehalls, raves and northern soul gigs. Flares are flapping, fags are lit, the dancefloor\u2019s heaving. O\u2019 Magic Power of Bleakness is an invocation of childhood and youth, but also a picture of a period, of the modernity of motorways and 60s shopping precincts, of three-day weeks and Liverpool under Thatcherism, of the Mersey beat and Madchester, Joy Division gigs and leaden pianos accompanying muffled Sunday choirs. The four-to-the-floor beats, Ian Curtis\u2019s on-stage manic gyrations and ravers dancing on E carry us along down our own rivers of memory. Leckey is in there somewhere, reliving his past. Although he never planned it this way, the two earlier works projected large on a plain wall fit seamlessly. Childhood wonders and terrors (what lurks beneath the underpass? Did something die here?) and the possibility of escape through a youth culture that hadn\u2019t entirely been monetised even in the 1980s, make a potent mix. O\u2019 Magic Power of Bleakness is all about escape routes, real and imaginary, and their impossibility. If the show is a kind of Bildungsroman, and a homage to the music he loves, it is also a sideways nod to the fact that Leckey made his own escape, in the days before student loans and the capitalisation of higher education, into art. Romanticism runs through Leckey\u2019s work, but it is leavened by a strong, prickly, necessary streak of realism.",

Ursula, the youngest of four siblings, practised piano with her oldest brother Michael, and then headed off to her late afternoon gymnastics lesson in Schondorf, cycling through the forest along the lakeside path. When the gym class was over, she went to her cousin\u2019s house in Schondorf, where she ate dinner. At 7.20pm, Ursula\u2019s mother phoned the aunt to say her daughter needed to come home. The shadows were lengthening but it was still light, and the cycle ride would only take 10 minutes.</p> <p>Half an hour later, she was still not home. Her mother again called the aunt, who said Ursula had left 25 minutes before. Both of them immediately knew something was wrong. Ursula\u2019s father rushed into the forest from Eching, and her uncle did the same from Schondorf. They met in the middle, along the path. Ursula\u2019s name rang out through the darkening wood. But there was no reply.</p> <p>Within an hour neighbours, police and firemen had joined the search, torch beams raking the water and struggling to penetrate the thick undergrowth. With midnight approaching, and rain falling, a sniffer dog led its handler away from the lake, into the brush. There, 20 metres from the path, was Ursula\u2019s little red bike. But she was nowhere to be seen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"083202539cabd55e0354c945d0639524217f047d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/083202539cabd55e0354c945d0639524217f047d/0_0_463_663/349.jpg\" alt=\"Ursula Herrmann, aged 10.\" width=\"349\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ursula Herrmann, aged 10. <br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lka Bayern/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At first light the search intensified. Dozens of officers wearing raincoats and rubber boots spread out through the dense forest, on the border of which stands Landheim Schondorf, an expensive private school founded in 1905 and favoured by Bavaria\u2019s political and business elite. As a helicopter hovered overhead, a police boat and divers scanned the shallows of the lake. Local radio carried the shocking news of the missing girl in an idyllic part of the country: 1.43m (4ft 7in) tall with short blonde hair, wearing dark green cords, a grey woollen cardigan and red-brown sandals; the daughter of a teacher and a housewife.</p> <p>On the Thursday morning, when Ursula had been missing for more than 36 hours, the phone rang in the Herrmann house. When Ursula\u2019s parents picked up there was silence, and then a short, familiar jingle, which they recognised from the traffic bulletin on the Bayern 3 radio station. More silence ensued, and then the jingle played again before the caller hung up. Three more similar calls \u2013 baffling and sinister \u2013 followed over a period of hours. A team from the local police department, now stationed inside the Herrmann home, began recording the calls.</p> <p>At noon the next day, the postman delivered an envelope addressed to Ursula\u2019s father, marked urgent. Inside was a ransom note composed using letters and words cut out from tabloid newspapers. \u201cWe kidnapped your daughter,\u201d the note began, in broken German. \u201cIf you ever want to see your daughter alive again, then pay 2m deutschmarks [\u00a3450,000] ransom.\u201d The kidnappers, expecting the letter to have arrived a day earlier \u2013 before the calls began \u2013 explained that they would phone the Herrmanns using a jingle as their call sign. \u201cJust say if you will pay or not pay \u2026 if you call the police or do not pay we will kill your daughter.\u201d</p> <p>When the phone rang that afternoon, and the jingle sounded, Ursula\u2019s mother agreed to pay the ransom. She also asked for proof of life: what were her daughter\u2019s nicknames for her two stuffed toys? When the kidnappers did not reply, she became frantic. \u201cTalk to me, say something, something from Ursula!\u201d</p> <p>That same evening, the kidnappers posted a second letter, which arrived on Monday 21 September, with curiously specific instructions regarding the ransom. The kidnappers wanted the money to be paid in used 100-deutschmark bills, packed in a suitcase. It was to be delivered to an as yet unnamed location by Ursula\u2019s father, who was to drive alone in a yellow Fiat 600 going no faster than 90km/h.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b3cf77b7936680c61acd5de3ced5520632c2ac2e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3cf77b7936680c61acd5de3ced5520632c2ac2e/0_0_2529_3500/723.jpg\" alt=\"One of letters sent by the kidnappers, composed of newspaper cuttings.\" width=\"723\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of letters sent by the kidnappers, composed of newspaper cuttings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Unlike some other residents of Eching, and the parents of the pupils at the boarding school in Schondorf, the Herrmanns were not wealthy. They had only been able to build a home near the lake because Ursula\u2019s great-grandfather had purchased some grazing land there decades earlier. A neighbour raised part of the ransom, and the state agreed to cover the rest.</p> <p>The Herrmanns waited desperately for more instructions. But there were no more letters and no more calls. Nor did the police have any strong leads. Two weeks passed. The police decided to search the forest again. More than a hundred officers were assembled, with 10 sniffer dogs. The wood was divided into four parts, and each quarter into small grids. The teams began searching every grid, one by one, using metal rods to probe the ground.</p> <p>By the fourth day of searching, a gloomy Sunday, they had covered most of the forest. Ursula had been missing for 19 days. At 9.30am, there was a loud shout. In a tiny glade about 800m away from the lake path, one of the officers had struck something solid when probing the soil. Another policeman rushed over and, after wiping away the leaves and scraping through a layer of clay, discovered a brown blanket covering a wooden board. He removed it only to find second board, which appeared to be the lid of a box. It was 72cm by 60cm \u2013 the size of a small coffee table \u2013 painted green and locked from the top with seven sliding bolts. Using a spade, he forced the lid open, and peered in. There was Ursula. Her body was cold, lifeless. The officer wept when lifting her out.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Two detectives were sent to break the news to Ursula\u2019s parents at their home, a short walk away. While her mother was too distraught to ask any questions, her father asked repeatedly: had his daughter been hurt before her death? The truthful answer was no. An autopsy concluded that Ursula died within 30 minutes to five hours of being buried. Since there was no sign of struggle, or even movement, inside the box, the doctors assumed she had been drugged beforehand, possibly with nitrous oxide.</p> <p>It appeared that the kidnappers had planned to keep Ursula alive. The box, 1.40m deep, was fitted with a shelf and a seat that doubled as a toilet. It was stocked with three bottles of water, 12 cans of Fanta, six large chocolate bars, four packets of biscuits and two packs of chewing gum. It also contained a small, bizarre library of 21 books, from Donald Duck comics to westerns, romance novels and thrillers with titles such as The Horror Lurks Everywhere. There was a light and a portable radio tuned to Bayern 3, the same station that broadcast the traffic jingle. To enable Ursula to breathe, the box had a ventilation system made from plastic plumbing pipes, which extended to ground level. But whoever designed it had failed to realise that without a machine to circulate the air, the oxygen would quickly run out.</p> <p>The police believed they were hunting more than one kidnapper, because of the size and weight of the box. At 60kg, it would probably have needed at least two people to carry it into the woods. The perpetrators must have known the forest well, for they had chosen a remote site within it, and had avoided attention while digging the hole and hacking paths through the dense brush.</p> <p>In Eching and nearby villages, parents who previously let their children roam free were now terrified to let them out of sight. The shock was amplified by the frenzied press coverage. On the day of the funeral, after much harassment from journalists, Ursula\u2019s brother Michael, a shy 18-year-old, lost his temper with a photographer who held a camera right in front of his face, and knocked the camera to the ground.</p> <p>Desperate to find the culprits, the police offered a DM30,000 reward for information, and tips poured in. One name that came up was Werner Mazurek. He was 31, lived with his wife and their two children just a few hundred metres from the Herrmanns. A trained car mechanic who left school at 15 and now ran his own TV repair business, Mazurek was good with his hands. He was imposing \u2013 tall, with a beer-drinker\u2019s stomach \u2013 and quick-tempered, and not well liked in Eching. He was also heavily in debt, owing a bank more than DM140,000, so he had a motive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"22d141b8bf712d67d3cb2a359846a5c1eb77f020\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/22d141b8bf712d67d3cb2a359846a5c1eb77f020/0_0_1300_1625/800.jpg\" alt=\"Police Sketch of the box in which Ursula\u2019s body was found\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A police sketch of the box in which Ursula\u2019s body was found</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HAND OUT</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Questioned by police a week after Ursula\u2019s body was found, Mazurek could not initially recall his movements on the night she went missing. It took him 24 hours to provide an alibi: he had been playing the board game Risk with his wife and two friends. But a search of his home and workshop revealed nothing that linked him to the crime. Later that month, the forensics team examining the box found a fingerprint on a piece of duct tape, raising hopes of a breakthrough. Thousands of locals, including Mazurek, were fingerprinted, but no match was discovered.</p> <p>The police still suspected that Mazurek was involved. At the end of January 1982, they arrested him, along with two of his friends, and interrogated them for several days before releasing them. A month later, another of Mazurek\u2019s acquaintances was questioned. Klaus Pfaffinger was an unemployed mechanic with a drinking problem. His landlord, who was owed rent, had told police that in the weeks before the crime he had seen his tenant driving his moped with a spade strapped to the side. Pfaffinger initially protested his innocence. But on the second day of questioning, when the interrogators took a break and he was alone with the police secretary, he said a startling thing: \u201cWhat if I know something?\u201d When the interrogators returned, Pfaffinger told them that Mazurek had asked him to dig a hole in the forest in early September 1981, promising payment of DM1,000 and a colour television. Pfaffinger said he had dug the hole and had later seen a box embedded inside.</p> <p>Convinced they had cracked the case, the detectives drove Pfaffinger to the forest that separated Eching and Schondorf. They asked him to lead them to the burial site. To their dismay, he was unable to locate it, or even come close. On returning to the police station, he announced: \u201cI am revoking this confession, it\u2019s not true what I said.\u201d During at least 10 subsequent interrogations in the following months, he refused to repeat his confession, and was eventually released without charge.</p> <p>By the summer of 1982, after his name was smeared, Mazurek was preparing to move away from Eching with his family. The lead detective who had pursued him was replaced, and the net cast more widely. Some 100,000 colour posters requesting help with the investigation were distributed nationwide. A television programme, Aktenzeichen XY ... Ungel\u00f6st \u2013 Case number XY \u2026 Unsolved \u2013 which would serve as the model for the BBC\u2019s Crimewatch and America\u2019s Most Wanted, featured a long segment on the Ursula Herrmann case. The new police team found more evidence of the kidnappers\u2019 methods, including a wire that they had strung through the trees along the lakeside path to serve as an alert system during the abduction. But investigations of other suspects came to nothing. By the end of the 1980s, the investigation had wound down. Across Germany, most people still remembered the shocking unsolved case of the 10-year-old girl buried alive in the box.</p> <p>Ursula\u2019s parents and siblings, meanwhile, were doing their best to move on with their lives. Though they grieved deeply for Ursula, who they remembered as an intelligent, energetic girl who loved to sing and paint, they did so in private, never speaking to the press. Soon after their youngest child\u2019s death, the parents had made a conscious decision not to let the hunt for the kidnappers consume the family, or the tragedy define their lives. Without any known perpetrators to blame, they tried to think of it as a terrible accident. It was hardest for Ursula\u2019s mother, who believed she should have gone to fetch her daughter from her cousin\u2019s house. Ursula\u2019s father and sister turned to their strong Christian faith to find peace. Her youngest brother eventually found solace in surfing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"15b48387ff902957feff55a043e63d60a474a7e5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15b48387ff902957feff55a043e63d60a474a7e5/34_201_3444_2066/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A model of the box on display at the district court in Augsburg.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A model of the box on display at the district court in Augsburg.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karl-Josef Hildebrand/EPA/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Michael, the elder brother, who was in his final year of school at the time of the crime, was playing music at a friend\u2019s house on the night Ursula disappeared. When his mother called in a panic, saying his little sister was missing, he rushed home and joined the search for her in the forest. He was devastated when her body was found. \u201cThen it quickly turned into: what can I do with this now?\u201d he told me recently. \u201cBecause I knew the \u2018why\u2019 could never be answered. I decided: I am alive and I have some tasks to do.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In the mid-2000s, the Bavarian state office for criminal investigations started looking in earnest at its backlog of cold cases. The most famous was the Ursula Herrmann kidnapping, which had by then appeared three times on Case number XY \u2026 Unsolved, and was still a stain on the reputation of the local police and judiciary. Prosecutors hoped that the development of DNA profiling over the previous two decades might help crack the case. The mass of evidence from the original investigation, including the ransom notes and the box, was painstakingly re-examined. Numerous hairs were found, from which the forensic experts were able to build the DNA profiles of several different people. Now they just needed a match. In 2007 they got one.</p> <p>A genetic sample recovered from a screw on the box matched that found on a glass in the Munich penthouse of a wealthy woman who was brutally murdered there in May 2006. But the police excitement about a breakthrough was short-lived. On trial for the Munich killing was the victim\u2019s nephew, who was only a few years old when Ursula was kidnapped. After extensive forensic investigations, the judges ruled that no link could be established between the two criminal cases, and the nephew was convicted for the Munich murder. How the match with the sample from the Herrmann case occurred remains a mystery \u2013 though very rare, <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2018/04/dna-testing-accuracy-golden-state-killer-science-spd/\" title=\"\">mistakes do occur</a> in genetic profiling.</p> <p>For the prosecutors looking at the Herrmann case, time was running out. Her death had not been deemed a murder, but rather kidnapping with deadly consequences, a crime that carried a 30-year statute of limitations. In five years, the people responsible would be in the clear. The state prosecutors went back to the 1980s case files, to look at the main suspects. Klaus Pfaffinger, the unemployed man who briefly claimed to have dug the hole, was dead. But Werner Mazurek was still alive, and living with his wife in the north of Germany, where he ran a boat accessories businesses and, with a friend on Tuesday evenings, a snack bar that bore the advertising slogan: \u201cNorbert\u2019s pig and Werner\u2019s beer, the finest at the harbour pier\u201d.</p> <p>In 2007, Mazurek was placed under surveillance and an undercover officer deployed to befriend him. Police planted recording devices in his car and his house, and tapped his phone. In October that year, his home was searched and he was asked to provide a saliva sample. It did not match any of the genetic profiles found on the box.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"05f5851ca6d525a76eb83cc1459b834830e9ec11\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05f5851ca6d525a76eb83cc1459b834830e9ec11/93_214_3207_1925/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ursula\u2019s brother Michael at the court during the murder trial in 2009.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ursula\u2019s brother Michael at the court during the murder trial in 2009.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dpa Picture Alliance Archive/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The prosecutors had one hope left. Among the items taken from Mazurek\u2019s house during the search was an old reel-to-reel tape recorder. In the calls to Ursula\u2019s parents in the days after her disappearance, the kidnappers had played a jingle. Was it possible that this device was used to record that jingle from the radio all those years ago? A sound expert, who had access to the original recordings of the 1981 calls, spent months conducting tests on the tape recorder, concluding that it was indeed used in the kidnapping.</p> <p>On 28 May 2008, nearly 27 years after Ursula\u2019s death, Mazurek was arrested and flown to Augsburg, a city near Eching. Ursula\u2019s parents, who were still living in the same house by the Ammersee, had been notified a few days before that an arrest was imminent. They were also told they could be part of the trial. Under the German legal system, relatives of the victims of certain serious crimes are allowed to formally join the prosecution as <em>nebenklage</em>, or co-plaintiffs. This gives them the right to view the evidence, request witnesses and put questions to the judges.</p> <p>Ursula\u2019s parents did not want to be confronted again by the horrifying details of their daughter\u2019s death, all these years later. Instead, it was agreed that the co-plaintiff would be their oldest son, Michael, who was by then in his 40s, teaching religion and music at a girls\u2019 secondary school in Augsburg. He was a quiet, family man, but also one who is \u201cnot content with half-truths\u201d, as his old friend Michael Hofstetter, who was with him in Eching on the evening Ursula disappeared, recently told the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung newspaper. \u201cHe has such a very deep sense of justice that drives him.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The trial opened in February 2009 before a packed court in Augsburg. Mazurek, characterised in one newspaper as a \u201cbearded giant\u201d, sat in front of his wife, who was also on trial as an accessory to the crime. Reading from a 20-page statement, Mazurek insisted he was innocent. \u201cI know I was certainly not a good citizen, sometimes rude, and we\u2019ll see many attempts to portray me as a bad person. But I have nothing to do with this act.\u201d</p> <p>The prosecution had no difficulty finding evidence of his poor character. Mazurek\u2019s daughter and stepson had few good things to say about him as a father. He had also had other scrapes with the law, including a fraud conviction in 2004 for falsifying documents. Then there was the story about the dog. In 1974, Mazurek returned from the Oktoberfest beer festival to find that the family dog, a mixed-breed named Susi, had overturned the rubbish bin in the kitchen. Mazurek grabbed the dog and locked it in the basement freezer. The next day his wife at the time, who would soon divorce him, went to the freezer to get some meat only to discover Susi there, frozen to death. Mazurek later said he had punished the pet \u201cwith exile to Siberia\u201d.</p> <p>The prosecution laid out the circumstantial evidence against Mazurek. He had a motive as he needed the money, and the means to secretly build a box, because he owned a workshop. While Ursula was missing he had been observed listening to police radio, and a piece of leather used in the box construction was cut from a belt owned by someone with a large stomach, like Mazurek. And, in 2007, after police searched and bugged his house, they listened in on a phone call between him and an old friend from Eching where they discussed the statute of limitations for the Ursula Herrmann case.</p> <p>But the key elements of the prosecutors\u2019 case were the revoked confession by Pfaffinger \u2013 that he dug the hole at Mazurek\u2019s request \u2013 and the tape recorder. They insisted the confession was credible. As the old police files showed, Pfaffinger\u2019s confession was accurate in several ways: he had described the burial site in detail, from the size of the forest glade and the dimensions of the hole to the soil conditions. The lead police investigator in 1982 was convinced Pfaffinger deliberately misled him during the forest visit, when he could not locate where the box was buried. Testifying in court, all these years later, the same policeman described Pfaffinger as an \u201cexcellent actor and practised swindler\u201d.</p> <p>The tape recorder was the most important, and controversial, piece of evidence. When questioned by police in 2007, Mazurek said he had purchased it only a few weeks earlier, at a flea market while on a short holiday with his wife. But he could not prove who sold it to him, and nobody at the market could recall such a device being on sale that day. The state\u2019s expert, whose speciality was phonetics rather than audio, described how, in the recording of the ransom calls, you could hear a couple of clicking sounds \u2013 the buttons of a tape recorder being pressed during the recording of the jingle. When she pressed the buttons on the tape machine, she had, in her words, an \u201caha\u201d moment. The sounds were identical. Other subtle characteristics of the recording also corresponded precisely to the specific machine in front of her. It was, she said, \u201cprobable\u201d that the very same tape recorder found in Mazurek\u2019s house was used in the ransom calls.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2f76fcf3c44b362ca3989b57a06e32aed36b1d4f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f76fcf3c44b362ca3989b57a06e32aed36b1d4f/0_15_3192_1916/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Detective chief superintendent Detlef Puchelt shows a picture of the tape recorder that was used as evidence.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Detective chief superintendent Detlef Puchelt shows a picture of the tape recorder that was used as evidence.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christof Stache/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Summing up, in March 2010, the senior prosecutor reminded the court that Ursula had been \u201cburied alive in a box\u201d, revealing the \u201ccold-bloodedness and mercilessness of the perpetrator\u201d. The three judges and two jurors were convinced, finding Mazurek guilty and sentencing him to life imprisonment. His wife was acquitted, due to lack of evidence. In court, everyone seemed happy that Ursula\u2019s killer had finally been put away. Everyone, that is, except one person.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>At the start of the trial, few people in court had taken much notice of Michael Herrmann. Despite his distinctive appearance \u2013 he wears his grey hair in a ponytail and at the time also sported thin sideburns down to his jaw \u2013 he is unassuming, not the kind of man who draws attention to himself. After graduating from high school, he studied teaching in Augsburg, and then opened a music store, selling instruments and equipment, including tape recorders. He got married, had three children and fostered a fourth. He loved watching them grow up, seeing them share his love of music, finding their own way in life.</p> <p>People who knew what happened to Ursula sometimes asked if it made Michael anxious about his own kids, but for some reason it didn\u2019t. Nor did he ever think about looking for the perpetrators himself; that was the job of the police. Though he felt at peace in his life, his sister\u2019s death still felt to him like an \u201cunclosed circle\u201d. The trial, and his status as a co-plaintiff, offered an opportunity to close it. While most <em>nebenklage</em> are passive observers in court, Michael decided to take his role far more seriously. He would not allow the family to be victims a second time.</p> <p>Before the trial started, to the surprise of his state-assigned lawyer, Michael had requested full access to the case files, which ran into tens of thousands of scanned pages. In the first few weeks of the trial he got through 6,000 pages, locking himself in the study at home at night, unable to stop reading. His memories of Ursula were strong: he recalled how, despite her liveliness, she was also cautious and at times sensitive, growing upset when some of her schoolmates repeatedly misbehaved. But reading through the typewritten police reports he realised he had forgotten many of the details of the horrifying days in September 1981, even the fact that he had helped Ursula with her piano practice just a few hours before she was kidnapped. It was, he felt, like his brain has somehow blanked out that part of his life. To Michael, there was much to suggest Mazurek might have committed the crime, but there were also things that troubled him about the prosecution case. He could not understand why Pfaffinger\u2019s revoked confession was now being treated as plausible, when it was dismissed all those years before. From the police files it was clear that Pfaffinger had a serious alcohol problem. While in detention he claimed to have experienced hallucinations. He was also chronically work-shy; questioned in 2008, his former wife called him a \u201clazy guy\u201d who would never have agreed to dig a large hole.</p> <p>As the court heard, Pfaffinger\u2019s confession was not even signed; the investigator wrote it down from memory weeks later. And, as with Mazurek, there was no DNA proof connecting Pfaffinger to the crime. Before the trial, the police exhumed Pfaffinger\u2019s body but there was no match to the genetic profiles they had discovered among the evidence a few years before.</p> <p>Most concerning to Michael was the tape recorder. With his background in music, he knew a lot about acoustics and sound engineering, and could not understand how a tape recorder could be definitively linked to the ransom calls all those years ago. Even if the reel-to-reel device had been used to record the jingle from the radio, as the prosecution alleged, the kidnappers would still have had to transfer that recording to a second, more portable device, since the calls to the Herrmann house were made from pay phones. The acoustic environments in the booth and at the kidnapper\u2019s home would also have influenced what the police eventually heard and recorded at the other end of the phone line.</p> <p>Michael\u2019s lawyer advised him not to make a big deal out of it. \u201cShe said: \u2018you don\u2019t do this as a <em>nebenklage</em>\u2019. But I did not think about habits, I just did what I thought was right,\u201d Michael told me. He wrote a letter to the court, calling the sound expert\u2019s report about the tape recorder \u201cincomplete or one-sided\u201d. The judges were not happy, but by law they were obliged to read out the letter in court. It was a highly unusual and sensational intervention \u2013 a member of the prosecution team, the victim\u2019s brother, no less, acting in favour of the defence. When the verdict against Mazurek was announced, Michael made a statement at the courthouse. \u201cI am not convinced of his guilt,\u201d he said. \u201cBut neither am I convinced of his innocence.\u201d Instead of the circle being closed, it had opened further.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Six months after the trial, in late 2010, Michael began to notice a strange, high frequency noise in his left ear. At night the hissing would wake him up and prevent him falling back asleep. Even worse, it often tormented him during the day, especially when was he trying to teach music. He had never experienced tinnitus before, and thought it might relate to the trial. The court-appointed psychologist, on hand to assist relatives of crime victims, examined him and agreed that the stress of the court case was indeed the likely cause.</p> <p>During the trial, Mazurek had sent Michael a letter \u2013 not to thank him for questioning the tape recorder evidence but to suggest that they were somehow on the same side. From prison Mazurek kept writing, and even sent a Christmas card. In 2013, Michael finally replied. \u201cI was surprised to receive a letter from you, because it is certainly clear to you that despite all the doubts I have about your guilt, I have considerable reservations about your person,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf you are not the culprit I wish [for] more new insights and that you can be rehabilitated. If you are the culprit, go to hell.\u201d</p> <p>By then, Michael was increasingly sceptical that Mazurek was guilty. After the trial ended, Michael kept returning, night after night, his ear ringing, to the case files, which he had stored on his computer, meticulously arranging the evidence in folders. It had put strain on his marriage \u2013 he separated from his wife in 2012 \u2013 but he could not let it go. He felt he owed it to his parents, to himself, even to the German public, to pursue the truth. \u201cWhat drives me is ethics \u2013 doing what is morally right,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt was just wrong for the case to end like it did.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a7c23b1c7f5c290891ebd75cc9f650a0eafa42ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7c23b1c7f5c290891ebd75cc9f650a0eafa42ec/9_48_2715_1629/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Werner Mazurek in court\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Werner Mazurek in court</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christof Stache/APN</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So he came up with a plan. In 2013, he filed a civil claim, seeking \u20ac20,000 in damages from Mazurek for causing his tinnitus. It was a legal ruse: since Mazurek would defend the case on the basis that he was wrongfully convicted and so could not be considered responsible, the court would have to reconsider the facts of the criminal trial before coming to a conclusion. It would be an opportunity, Michael believed, \u201cto get nearer to the truth\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe judges knew what was going on, and they were pissed off,\u201d Joachim Feller, who has been Michael\u2019s lawyer since 2012, told me when we met at his offices in Landsberg am Lech, an ancient town about 20 minutes drive from Eching. \u201cThey tried several times to stop it going forward.\u201d The court insisted that an independent psychiatrist examine Michael, and to rule on whether his tinnitus was caused by the trial. After the psychiatrist confirmed it was, the case finally went ahead in 2016. It dragged on for more than two years.</p> <p>Unlike with the criminal trial, where the media focus was on Mazurek, it was now on Michael. He found himself having to explain to his pupils in his music and religion classes, who knew him as a reserved, kind teacher, why they were seeing his face in the newspapers and on TV. He took journalists to Eching, and into the forest where Ursula was kidnapped. Even so, apart from Herrmann\u2019s close family and friends, few understood why he was pursuing the case. A local journalist who covered the criminal and civil cases told me his newsroom colleagues often asked him why Herrmann \u201ccould not just let it go\u201d. \u201cI myself am still trying to work out why Michael Herrmann is acting like this,\u201d the journalist said. \u201cHe is quiet and calm, but still he looks into the files \u2026 There is a little obsession.\u201d</p> <p>As the civil trial went on, it became clear that he was not the only person with doubts about the original verdict. Appearing for the defence was a retired physicist and amateur sound expert named Bernd Haider, who had built his first tape recorder from scratch in the 1960s and lived in a village just a few miles from Eching. He vividly remembered the coverage of the crime from 1981, though he had never heard of Mazurek before his arrest. Haider had followed the 2009 trial in the media and, like Michael, was highly sceptical about the tape-recorder evidence. Later, he had borrowed a similar machine, got hold of the ransom call recordings, and tried to see if it was possible to replicate the phonetic expert\u2019s findings. After a year of testing, he concluded it was not, and offered his assistance to Mazurek\u2019s lawyer.</p> <p>When I visited Haider this spring, the borrowed tape recorder was still in his loft. After a lunch of wiener schnitzel and potatoes, he told me: \u201cMichael Herrmann was the only person in the original trial who understood what the problem with this evidence was. He said \u2018it\u2019s impossible\u2019, but he was sitting on the wrong side of the court!\u201d</p> <p>Towards the end of the civil case, Michael gained another ally. In London, a German academic named Barbara Zipser read an article online about his efforts to get to the truth. Zipser was a child in Germany when Ursula was kidnapped, and recalled the horror she felt then. In terms of its impact, it was the German equivalent of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/feb/12/madeleine-mccann-police-seek-more-funds-to-continue-inquiry\" title=\"\">Madeleine McCann case</a>, Zipser told me when we met this year. \u201cI thought: whoever did this, I want that person in jail,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Since Zipser\u2019s speciality is linguistic profiling \u2013 at Royal Holloway, University of London, she uses modern profiling techniques to identify authors of ancient Greek medical texts \u2013 she decided to compare the ransom notes sent by the kidnappers to samples of Mazurek\u2019s writing, which Haider had posted on the internet. Zipser analysed the words used, and the writing style. Whoever composed the ransom notes was well educated, she said, a native speaker pretending to be a foreigner by writing in broken German. \u201cI am sure it was not Mazurek,\u201d Zipser told me.</p> <p>Her opinion only hardened after she went to meet Michael in Germany, and spent many hours going through the case files with him. \u201cI know this is an incredible story but I\u2019ve seen the evidence, and Michael has done very good investigative work,\u201d she said. \u201cI support him in his findings.\u201d For a few years after the criminal trial Michael thought there was still a 50% chance that Mazurek was the kidnapper. Now he puts it at 1%.</p> <p>In August 2018, the civil case concluded and the court ordered Mazurek to pay Michael \u20ac7,000 for causing his tinnitus. It was a victory that to Michael represented a loss, since to arrive at the decision the judges first needed to agree with the criminal court that Mazurek, together with an unidentified accomplice, was indeed the man who had kidnapped Ursula.</p> <p>In an open letter to the Bavarian state and the media, Michael wrote: \u201cMy sister\u2019s fate has stayed with me for 37 years, and to this day, it is unclear who was actually responsible for her death. Could it be that the Augsburg legal system is not actually interested in solving the case of Ursula Herrmann, the death of my little sister? \u2026 If the court decides to close the proverbial lid, it should be well aware that one cannot shut the truth away.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Since Mazurek was arrested in 2008, he has been represented by Walter Rubach, one of Bavaria\u2019s best-known defence lawyers. Rubach sees things in black and white. If a client asks him whether he believes in their innocence \u2013 as Mazurek did in 2008 \u2013 he brushes away the question. \u201cI told him I don\u2019t believe any of my clients,\u201d Rubach told me in his chambers in Augsburg. \u201cMy job is to work out if there\u2019s enough proof and evidence to convict them.\u201d In Mazurek\u2019s case he was convinced from the start that there wasn\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cIt was clear that Mazurek was a person who could have committed something like that. But there were no hard facts \u2013 it was a circumstantial case at its finest,\u201d Rubach said. \u201cI am still upset at how he was convicted. What is it you say in England? Rather let 10 guilty men go free than hang one innocent one.\u201d</p> <p>Though Rubach has had little personal interaction with Michael, he has watched him across the court, and likes and admires him. \u201cWhat he has done, as a co-plaintiff, going against the decision of a court \u2013 this never happened before in Germany.\u201d</p> <p>From his prison cell in Germany\u2019s far north, Mazurek is still trying to clear his name. After I wrote to him this year, he replied saying he had hired a private investigator to track down the man who he says sold him the tape recorder in 2007. \u201cI am just angry and I am awaiting the 11th anniversary of my time in jail,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>On a mild Sunday morning in April, I met Michael in Augsburg. As he had been most days in court, he was dressed casually, in trainers, blue jeans and a black jacket. Despite his legal setbacks, and the tinnitus that continues to bother him, he comes across as calm and warm, and possesses a dry sense of humour. As we drove through the Bavarian countryside towards Eching, he tried to explain the meaning of <em>\u00fcberfordert</em>, the word he used to describe the police in 1981: \u201cIt means when the task you have is bigger than your capabilities \u2013 like Brexit.\u201d</p> <p>Michael knows the case material so well \u2013 he has put in far more hours of research than any of the lawyers for the defence or prosecution \u2013 that when he speaks, it is with the precision and detachment of a special investigator, rather than a relative. After parking the car beside the road between Eching and Schondorf, he noted it was probably where the kidnappers had parked when bringing the box to the forest. An SUV track led into the woods. \u201cWe need to walk 141 metres,\u201d Michael said, and then look 20 metres to the left, to locate the spot where Ursula was buried. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if she was sedated and carried or if she was forced to walk there,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we know she was taken on paths specially cut through the forest.\u201d</p> <p>Michael\u2019s father died several years ago, and in 2016 his mother moved out of the family home in the village to Augsburg. But his younger brother Hannes \u2013 the surfer \u2013 still lives in the house, along with two Syrian refugees who rent out the bottom floor. Michael phoned him \u2013 he did not want to show up with a journalist, unannounced \u2013 and Hannes invited us in for coffee. We never spoke about Ursula. As with his oldest sister and their mother, Hannes has never talked to the media about his sister\u2019s death, though Michael says that in private his family supports his work on the case, as do his children and his new partner. But in public, at least, he is alone in his quest to reopen the case.</p> <p>After lunch at a restaurant beside the lake, where sailboats bobbed in the distance, we walked along the road towards the forest, the route Ursula took on her way to gym class nearly 40 years ago. The spruce trees are much taller than they were then, and the undergrowth less thick, but the path is the same: three metres wide, compact gravel. Cyclists on electric bikes sped by.</p> <p>After a few minutes, as we neared a small jetty leading to a wooden hut used by bathers, Michael stopped on the path. \u201cThis is where Ursula was kidnapped,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s where her bike was found and where the bell-wire ended.\u201d The bell-wire is the 140m-long coil of insulated copper wire the kidnappers used as part of a warning system. Though the police had noticed the wire while searching for Ursula, they only learned of its significance more than a year later, when investigators visited the private boarding school in Schondorf to talk to pupils about the case. Two students came forward, saying that seven or eight months after the kidnapping, when chasing an owl through the forest, they had found the bell-wire strung through the trees next to the lakeside path. The boys then did a very strange thing: they took the wire down, measured it on the school athletics track, and then kept it in their dormitory in a locked box, until the police visit.</p> <p>On examining the wire, the investigators realised it must have been used during Ursula\u2019s abduction. While one of the kidnappers waited for the victim, the other presumably served as a lookout further along the path, with their finger on a button that would light up a bulb or sound a buzzer at the other end of the wire.</p> <p>Michael believes the wire is one of the key pieces of evidence that could help identify the real kidnappers. Besides hunters, joggers and cyclists, the boarding school pupils also knew the forest well. Yet it appears that none of them were fingerprinted at the time of the investigation. Another piece of evidence also hints at the possible involvement of younger people in the plot: an impression on the paper of one of the ransom notes revealed a mathematical probability tree, of the sort taught to teenagers. Michael also notes that in a comic found in the box, one of the main characters drives a Fiat 600, the car that was mentioned in the ransom note and which was rare in Germany at the time, suggesting the kidnappers may have read the comic.</p> <p>Late last year, in an effort to have the case reopened, Michael submitted a dossier of all his new evidence and theories to the state prosecutor\u2019s office in Augsburg. In April, when I interviewed Matthias Nickolai, spokesman for the public prosecutor, he acknowledged that many people still had questions about the verdict in the criminal trial, but insisted the judges had arrived at the correct decision in 2010, and that it was \u201cfinal and absolute\u201d. In August, this became official, when the prosecutor\u2019s office announced it would not be reopening the case.</p> <p>Through his lawyer, Michael told the local press that he would be making no more public statements about the case, nor giving interviews, which the media interpreted as him finally giving up. But when I emailed him recently he said this was not true. \u201cI didn\u2019t say that I am not going to take it any further,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>On 15 September, a few days after I received that message, it was the 38th anniversary of Ursula\u2019s kidnapping and death. As they have done for the last few years, Michael, along with his two siblings and his mother, travelled to the graveyard in Eching where Ursula is buried. Just the four of them, no partners. There they remembered the little girl who left her cousin\u2019s house on her red bike on a summer\u2019s evening and never came home. \u2022</p>",

      "bodyText": "In the Alpine foothills in the far south of Germany is a vast lake called the Ammersee. Its shores are dotted with centuries-old villages where wealthy families from Munich buy large second homes and tourists drink beer at waterfront restaurants. At the north end of the lake is a pair of such villages, Eching am Ammersee and Schondorf, less than two miles apart. Separating them is a block of spruce forest that attracts hunters, joggers, mountain bikers and in the late summer 38 years ago, kidnappers preparing to commit what would become one of the country\u2019s most notorious postwar crimes. After class on Tuesday 15 September 1981, the first day of the new school year, a 10-year-old girl named Ursula Herrmann returned to her house in Eching. Ursula, the youngest of four siblings, practised piano with her oldest brother Michael, and then headed off to her late afternoon gymnastics lesson in Schondorf, cycling through the forest along the lakeside path. When the gym class was over, she went to her cousin\u2019s house in Schondorf, where she ate dinner. At 7.20pm, Ursula\u2019s mother phoned the aunt to say her daughter needed to come home. The shadows were lengthening but it was still light, and the cycle ride would only take 10 minutes. Half an hour later, she was still not home. Her mother again called the aunt, who said Ursula had left 25 minutes before. Both of them immediately knew something was wrong. Ursula\u2019s father rushed into the forest from Eching, and her uncle did the same from Schondorf. They met in the middle, along the path. Ursula\u2019s name rang out through the darkening wood. But there was no reply. Within an hour neighbours, police and firemen had joined the search, torch beams raking the water and struggling to penetrate the thick undergrowth. With midnight approaching, and rain falling, a sniffer dog led its handler away from the lake, into the brush. There, 20 metres from the path, was Ursula\u2019s little red bike. But she was nowhere to be seen. At first light the search intensified. Dozens of officers wearing raincoats and rubber boots spread out through the dense forest, on the border of which stands Landheim Schondorf, an expensive private school founded in 1905 and favoured by Bavaria\u2019s political and business elite. As a helicopter hovered overhead, a police boat and divers scanned the shallows of the lake. Local radio carried the shocking news of the missing girl in an idyllic part of the country: 1.43m (4ft 7in) tall with short blonde hair, wearing dark green cords, a grey woollen cardigan and red-brown sandals; the daughter of a teacher and a housewife. On the Thursday morning, when Ursula had been missing for more than 36 hours, the phone rang in the Herrmann house. When Ursula\u2019s parents picked up there was silence, and then a short, familiar jingle, which they recognised from the traffic bulletin on the Bayern 3 radio station. More silence ensued, and then the jingle played again before the caller hung up. Three more similar calls \u2013 baffling and sinister \u2013 followed over a period of hours. A team from the local police department, now stationed inside the Herrmann home, began recording the calls. At noon the next day, the postman delivered an envelope addressed to Ursula\u2019s father, marked urgent. Inside was a ransom note composed using letters and words cut out from tabloid newspapers. \u201cWe kidnapped your daughter,\u201d the note began, in broken German. \u201cIf you ever want to see your daughter alive again, then pay 2m deutschmarks [\u00a3450,000] ransom.\u201d The kidnappers, expecting the letter to have arrived a day earlier \u2013 before the calls began \u2013 explained that they would phone the Herrmanns using a jingle as their call sign. \u201cJust say if you will pay or not pay \u2026 if you call the police or do not pay we will kill your daughter.\u201d When the phone rang that afternoon, and the jingle sounded, Ursula\u2019s mother agreed to pay the ransom. She also asked for proof of life: what were her daughter\u2019s nicknames for her two stuffed toys? When the kidnappers did not reply, she became frantic. \u201cTalk to me, say something, something from Ursula!\u201d That same evening, the kidnappers posted a second letter, which arrived on Monday 21 September, with curiously specific instructions regarding the ransom. The kidnappers wanted the money to be paid in used 100-deutschmark bills, packed in a suitcase. It was to be delivered to an as yet unnamed location by Ursula\u2019s father, who was to drive alone in a yellow Fiat 600 going no faster than 90km/h. Unlike some other residents of Eching, and the parents of the pupils at the boarding school in Schondorf, the Herrmanns were not wealthy. They had only been able to build a home near the lake because Ursula\u2019s great-grandfather had purchased some grazing land there decades earlier. A neighbour raised part of the ransom, and the state agreed to cover the rest. The Herrmanns waited desperately for more instructions. But there were no more letters and no more calls. Nor did the police have any strong leads. Two weeks passed. The police decided to search the forest again. More than a hundred officers were assembled, with 10 sniffer dogs. The wood was divided into four parts, and each quarter into small grids. The teams began searching every grid, one by one, using metal rods to probe the ground. By the fourth day of searching, a gloomy Sunday, they had covered most of the forest. Ursula had been missing for 19 days. At 9.30am, there was a loud shout. In a tiny glade about 800m away from the lake path, one of the officers had struck something solid when probing the soil. Another policeman rushed over and, after wiping away the leaves and scraping through a layer of clay, discovered a brown blanket covering a wooden board. He removed it only to find second board, which appeared to be the lid of a box. It was 72cm by 60cm \u2013 the size of a small coffee table \u2013 painted green and locked from the top with seven sliding bolts. Using a spade, he forced the lid open, and peered in. There was Ursula. Her body was cold, lifeless. The officer wept when lifting her out. * * * Two detectives were sent to break the news to Ursula\u2019s parents at their home, a short walk away. While her mother was too distraught to ask any questions, her father asked repeatedly: had his daughter been hurt before her death? The truthful answer was no. An autopsy concluded that Ursula died within 30 minutes to five hours of being buried. Since there was no sign of struggle, or even movement, inside the box, the doctors assumed she had been drugged beforehand, possibly with nitrous oxide. It appeared that the kidnappers had planned to keep Ursula alive. The box, 1.40m deep, was fitted with a shelf and a seat that doubled as a toilet. It was stocked with three bottles of water, 12 cans of Fanta, six large chocolate bars, four packets of biscuits and two packs of chewing gum. It also contained a small, bizarre library of 21 books, from Donald Duck comics to westerns, romance novels and thrillers with titles such as The Horror Lurks Everywhere. There was a light and a portable radio tuned to Bayern 3, the same station that broadcast the traffic jingle. To enable Ursula to breathe, the box had a ventilation system made from plastic plumbing pipes, which extended to ground level. But whoever designed it had failed to realise that without a machine to circulate the air, the oxygen would quickly run out. The police believed they were hunting more than one kidnapper, because of the size and weight of the box. At 60kg, it would probably have needed at least two people to carry it into the woods. The perpetrators must have known the forest well, for they had chosen a remote site within it, and had avoided attention while digging the hole and hacking paths through the dense brush. In Eching and nearby villages, parents who previously let their children roam free were now terrified to let them out of sight. The shock was amplified by the frenzied press coverage. On the day of the funeral, after much harassment from journalists, Ursula\u2019s brother Michael, a shy 18-year-old, lost his temper with a photographer who held a camera right in front of his face, and knocked the camera to the ground. Desperate to find the culprits, the police offered a DM30,000 reward for information, and tips poured in. One name that came up was Werner Mazurek. He was 31, lived with his wife and their two children just a few hundred metres from the Herrmanns. A trained car mechanic who left school at 15 and now ran his own TV repair business, Mazurek was good with his hands. He was imposing \u2013 tall, with a beer-drinker\u2019s stomach \u2013 and quick-tempered, and not well liked in Eching. He was also heavily in debt, owing a bank more than DM140,000, so he had a motive. Questioned by police a week after Ursula\u2019s body was found, Mazurek could not initially recall his movements on the night she went missing. It took him 24 hours to provide an alibi: he had been playing the board game Risk with his wife and two friends. But a search of his home and workshop revealed nothing that linked him to the crime. Later that month, the forensics team examining the box found a fingerprint on a piece of duct tape, raising hopes of a breakthrough. Thousands of locals, including Mazurek, were fingerprinted, but no match was discovered. The police still suspected that Mazurek was involved. At the end of January 1982, they arrested him, along with two of his friends, and interrogated them for several days before releasing them. A month later, another of Mazurek\u2019s acquaintances was questioned. Klaus Pfaffinger was an unemployed mechanic with a drinking problem. His landlord, who was owed rent, had told police that in the weeks before the crime he had seen his tenant driving his moped with a spade strapped to the side. Pfaffinger initially protested his innocence. But on the second day of questioning, when the interrogators took a break and he was alone with the police secretary, he said a startling thing: \u201cWhat if I know something?\u201d When the interrogators returned, Pfaffinger told them that Mazurek had asked him to dig a hole in the forest in early September 1981, promising payment of DM1,000 and a colour television. Pfaffinger said he had dug the hole and had later seen a box embedded inside. Convinced they had cracked the case, the detectives drove Pfaffinger to the forest that separated Eching and Schondorf. They asked him to lead them to the burial site. To their dismay, he was unable to locate it, or even come close. On returning to the police station, he announced: \u201cI am revoking this confession, it\u2019s not true what I said.\u201d During at least 10 subsequent interrogations in the following months, he refused to repeat his confession, and was eventually released without charge. By the summer of 1982, after his name was smeared, Mazurek was preparing to move away from Eching with his family. The lead detective who had pursued him was replaced, and the net cast more widely. Some 100,000 colour posters requesting help with the investigation were distributed nationwide. A television programme, Aktenzeichen XY ... Ungel\u00f6st \u2013 Case number XY \u2026 Unsolved \u2013 which would serve as the model for the BBC\u2019s Crimewatch and America\u2019s Most Wanted, featured a long segment on the Ursula Herrmann case. The new police team found more evidence of the kidnappers\u2019 methods, including a wire that they had strung through the trees along the lakeside path to serve as an alert system during the abduction. But investigations of other suspects came to nothing. By the end of the 1980s, the investigation had wound down. Across Germany, most people still remembered the shocking unsolved case of the 10-year-old girl buried alive in the box. Ursula\u2019s parents and siblings, meanwhile, were doing their best to move on with their lives. Though they grieved deeply for Ursula, who they remembered as an intelligent, energetic girl who loved to sing and paint, they did so in private, never speaking to the press. Soon after their youngest child\u2019s death, the parents had made a conscious decision not to let the hunt for the kidnappers consume the family, or the tragedy define their lives. Without any known perpetrators to blame, they tried to think of it as a terrible accident. It was hardest for Ursula\u2019s mother, who believed she should have gone to fetch her daughter from her cousin\u2019s house. Ursula\u2019s father and sister turned to their strong Christian faith to find peace. Her youngest brother eventually found solace in surfing. Michael, the elder brother, who was in his final year of school at the time of the crime, was playing music at a friend\u2019s house on the night Ursula disappeared. When his mother called in a panic, saying his little sister was missing, he rushed home and joined the search for her in the forest. He was devastated when her body was found. \u201cThen it quickly turned into: what can I do with this now?\u201d he told me recently. \u201cBecause I knew the \u2018why\u2019 could never be answered. I decided: I am alive and I have some tasks to do.\u201d * * * In the mid-2000s, the Bavarian state office for criminal investigations started looking in earnest at its backlog of cold cases. The most famous was the Ursula Herrmann kidnapping, which had by then appeared three times on Case number XY \u2026 Unsolved, and was still a stain on the reputation of the local police and judiciary. Prosecutors hoped that the development of DNA profiling over the previous two decades might help crack the case. The mass of evidence from the original investigation, including the ransom notes and the box, was painstakingly re-examined. Numerous hairs were found, from which the forensic experts were able to build the DNA profiles of several different people. Now they just needed a match. In 2007 they got one. A genetic sample recovered from a screw on the box matched that found on a glass in the Munich penthouse of a wealthy woman who was brutally murdered there in May 2006. But the police excitement about a breakthrough was short-lived. On trial for the Munich killing was the victim\u2019s nephew, who was only a few years old when Ursula was kidnapped. After extensive forensic investigations, the judges ruled that no link could be established between the two criminal cases, and the nephew was convicted for the Munich murder. How the match with the sample from the Herrmann case occurred remains a mystery \u2013 though very rare, mistakes do occur in genetic profiling. For the prosecutors looking at the Herrmann case, time was running out. Her death had not been deemed a murder, but rather kidnapping with deadly consequences, a crime that carried a 30-year statute of limitations. In five years, the people responsible would be in the clear. The state prosecutors went back to the 1980s case files, to look at the main suspects. Klaus Pfaffinger, the unemployed man who briefly claimed to have dug the hole, was dead. But Werner Mazurek was still alive, and living with his wife in the north of Germany, where he ran a boat accessories businesses and, with a friend on Tuesday evenings, a snack bar that bore the advertising slogan: \u201cNorbert\u2019s pig and Werner\u2019s beer, the finest at the harbour pier\u201d. In 2007, Mazurek was placed under surveillance and an undercover officer deployed to befriend him. Police planted recording devices in his car and his house, and tapped his phone. In October that year, his home was searched and he was asked to provide a saliva sample. It did not match any of the genetic profiles found on the box. The prosecutors had one hope left. Among the items taken from Mazurek\u2019s house during the search was an old reel-to-reel tape recorder. In the calls to Ursula\u2019s parents in the days after her disappearance, the kidnappers had played a jingle. Was it possible that this device was used to record that jingle from the radio all those years ago? A sound expert, who had access to the original recordings of the 1981 calls, spent months conducting tests on the tape recorder, concluding that it was indeed used in the kidnapping. On 28 May 2008, nearly 27 years after Ursula\u2019s death, Mazurek was arrested and flown to Augsburg, a city near Eching. Ursula\u2019s parents, who were still living in the same house by the Ammersee, had been notified a few days before that an arrest was imminent. They were also told they could be part of the trial. Under the German legal system, relatives of the victims of certain serious crimes are allowed to formally join the prosecution as nebenklage, or co-plaintiffs. This gives them the right to view the evidence, request witnesses and put questions to the judges. Ursula\u2019s parents did not want to be confronted again by the horrifying details of their daughter\u2019s death, all these years later. Instead, it was agreed that the co-plaintiff would be their oldest son, Michael, who was by then in his 40s, teaching religion and music at a girls\u2019 secondary school in Augsburg. He was a quiet, family man, but also one who is \u201cnot content with half-truths\u201d, as his old friend Michael Hofstetter, who was with him in Eching on the evening Ursula disappeared, recently told the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung newspaper. \u201cHe has such a very deep sense of justice that drives him.\u201d * * * The trial opened in February 2009 before a packed court in Augsburg. Mazurek, characterised in one newspaper as a \u201cbearded giant\u201d, sat in front of his wife, who was also on trial as an accessory to the crime. Reading from a 20-page statement, Mazurek insisted he was innocent. \u201cI know I was certainly not a good citizen, sometimes rude, and we\u2019ll see many attempts to portray me as a bad person. But I have nothing to do with this act.\u201d The prosecution had no difficulty finding evidence of his poor character. Mazurek\u2019s daughter and stepson had few good things to say about him as a father. He had also had other scrapes with the law, including a fraud conviction in 2004 for falsifying documents. Then there was the story about the dog. In 1974, Mazurek returned from the Oktoberfest beer festival to find that the family dog, a mixed-breed named Susi, had overturned the rubbish bin in the kitchen. Mazurek grabbed the dog and locked it in the basement freezer. The next day his wife at the time, who would soon divorce him, went to the freezer to get some meat only to discover Susi there, frozen to death. Mazurek later said he had punished the pet \u201cwith exile to Siberia\u201d. The prosecution laid out the circumstantial evidence against Mazurek. He had a motive as he needed the money, and the means to secretly build a box, because he owned a workshop. While Ursula was missing he had been observed listening to police radio, and a piece of leather used in the box construction was cut from a belt owned by someone with a large stomach, like Mazurek. And, in 2007, after police searched and bugged his house, they listened in on a phone call between him and an old friend from Eching where they discussed the statute of limitations for the Ursula Herrmann case. But the key elements of the prosecutors\u2019 case were the revoked confession by Pfaffinger \u2013 that he dug the hole at Mazurek\u2019s request \u2013 and the tape recorder. They insisted the confession was credible. As the old police files showed, Pfaffinger\u2019s confession was accurate in several ways: he had described the burial site in detail, from the size of the forest glade and the dimensions of the hole to the soil conditions. The lead police investigator in 1982 was convinced Pfaffinger deliberately misled him during the forest visit, when he could not locate where the box was buried. Testifying in court, all these years later, the same policeman described Pfaffinger as an \u201cexcellent actor and practised swindler\u201d. The tape recorder was the most important, and controversial, piece of evidence. When questioned by police in 2007, Mazurek said he had purchased it only a few weeks earlier, at a flea market while on a short holiday with his wife. But he could not prove who sold it to him, and nobody at the market could recall such a device being on sale that day. The state\u2019s expert, whose speciality was phonetics rather than audio, described how, in the recording of the ransom calls, you could hear a couple of clicking sounds \u2013 the buttons of a tape recorder being pressed during the recording of the jingle. When she pressed the buttons on the tape machine, she had, in her words, an \u201caha\u201d moment. The sounds were identical. Other subtle characteristics of the recording also corresponded precisely to the specific machine in front of her. It was, she said, \u201cprobable\u201d that the very same tape recorder found in Mazurek\u2019s house was used in the ransom calls. Summing up, in March 2010, the senior prosecutor reminded the court that Ursula had been \u201cburied alive in a box\u201d, revealing the \u201ccold-bloodedness and mercilessness of the perpetrator\u201d. The three judges and two jurors were convinced, finding Mazurek guilty and sentencing him to life imprisonment. His wife was acquitted, due to lack of evidence. In court, everyone seemed happy that Ursula\u2019s killer had finally been put away. Everyone, that is, except one person. * * * At the start of the trial, few people in court had taken much notice of Michael Herrmann. Despite his distinctive appearance \u2013 he wears his grey hair in a ponytail and at the time also sported thin sideburns down to his jaw \u2013 he is unassuming, not the kind of man who draws attention to himself. After graduating from high school, he studied teaching in Augsburg, and then opened a music store, selling instruments and equipment, including tape recorders. He got married, had three children and fostered a fourth. He loved watching them grow up, seeing them share his love of music, finding their own way in life. People who knew what happened to Ursula sometimes asked if it made Michael anxious about his own kids, but for some reason it didn\u2019t. Nor did he ever think about looking for the perpetrators himself; that was the job of the police. Though he felt at peace in his life, his sister\u2019s death still felt to him like an \u201cunclosed circle\u201d. The trial, and his status as a co-plaintiff, offered an opportunity to close it. While most nebenklage are passive observers in court, Michael decided to take his role far more seriously. He would not allow the family to be victims a second time. Before the trial started, to the surprise of his state-assigned lawyer, Michael had requested full access to the case files, which ran into tens of thousands of scanned pages. In the first few weeks of the trial he got through 6,000 pages, locking himself in the study at home at night, unable to stop reading. His memories of Ursula were strong: he recalled how, despite her liveliness, she was also cautious and at times sensitive, growing upset when some of her schoolmates repeatedly misbehaved. But reading through the typewritten police reports he realised he had forgotten many of the details of the horrifying days in September 1981, even the fact that he had helped Ursula with her piano practice just a few hours before she was kidnapped. It was, he felt, like his brain has somehow blanked out that part of his life. To Michael, there was much to suggest Mazurek might have committed the crime, but there were also things that troubled him about the prosecution case. He could not understand why Pfaffinger\u2019s revoked confession was now being treated as plausible, when it was dismissed all those years before. From the police files it was clear that Pfaffinger had a serious alcohol problem. While in detention he claimed to have experienced hallucinations. He was also chronically work-shy; questioned in 2008, his former wife called him a \u201clazy guy\u201d who would never have agreed to dig a large hole. As the court heard, Pfaffinger\u2019s confession was not even signed; the investigator wrote it down from memory weeks later. And, as with Mazurek, there was no DNA proof connecting Pfaffinger to the crime. Before the trial, the police exhumed Pfaffinger\u2019s body but there was no match to the genetic profiles they had discovered among the evidence a few years before. Most concerning to Michael was the tape recorder. With his background in music, he knew a lot about acoustics and sound engineering, and could not understand how a tape recorder could be definitively linked to the ransom calls all those years ago. Even if the reel-to-reel device had been used to record the jingle from the radio, as the prosecution alleged, the kidnappers would still have had to transfer that recording to a second, more portable device, since the calls to the Herrmann house were made from pay phones. The acoustic environments in the booth and at the kidnapper\u2019s home would also have influenced what the police eventually heard and recorded at the other end of the phone line. Michael\u2019s lawyer advised him not to make a big deal out of it. \u201cShe said: \u2018you don\u2019t do this as a nebenklage\u2019. But I did not think about habits, I just did what I thought was right,\u201d Michael told me. He wrote a letter to the court, calling the sound expert\u2019s report about the tape recorder \u201cincomplete or one-sided\u201d. The judges were not happy, but by law they were obliged to read out the letter in court. It was a highly unusual and sensational intervention \u2013 a member of the prosecution team, the victim\u2019s brother, no less, acting in favour of the defence. When the verdict against Mazurek was announced, Michael made a statement at the courthouse. \u201cI am not convinced of his guilt,\u201d he said. \u201cBut neither am I convinced of his innocence.\u201d Instead of the circle being closed, it had opened further. * * * Six months after the trial, in late 2010, Michael began to notice a strange, high frequency noise in his left ear. At night the hissing would wake him up and prevent him falling back asleep. Even worse, it often tormented him during the day, especially when was he trying to teach music. He had never experienced tinnitus before, and thought it might relate to the trial. The court-appointed psychologist, on hand to assist relatives of crime victims, examined him and agreed that the stress of the court case was indeed the likely cause. During the trial, Mazurek had sent Michael a letter \u2013 not to thank him for questioning the tape recorder evidence but to suggest that they were somehow on the same side. From prison Mazurek kept writing, and even sent a Christmas card. In 2013, Michael finally replied. \u201cI was surprised to receive a letter from you, because it is certainly clear to you that despite all the doubts I have about your guilt, I have considerable reservations about your person,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf you are not the culprit I wish [for] more new insights and that you can be rehabilitated. If you are the culprit, go to hell.\u201d By then, Michael was increasingly sceptical that Mazurek was guilty. After the trial ended, Michael kept returning, night after night, his ear ringing, to the case files, which he had stored on his computer, meticulously arranging the evidence in folders. It had put strain on his marriage \u2013 he separated from his wife in 2012 \u2013 but he could not let it go. He felt he owed it to his parents, to himself, even to the German public, to pursue the truth. \u201cWhat drives me is ethics \u2013 doing what is morally right,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt was just wrong for the case to end like it did.\u201d So he came up with a plan. In 2013, he filed a civil claim, seeking \u20ac20,000 in damages from Mazurek for causing his tinnitus. It was a legal ruse: since Mazurek would defend the case on the basis that he was wrongfully convicted and so could not be considered responsible, the court would have to reconsider the facts of the criminal trial before coming to a conclusion. It would be an opportunity, Michael believed, \u201cto get nearer to the truth\u201d. \u201cThe judges knew what was going on, and they were pissed off,\u201d Joachim Feller, who has been Michael\u2019s lawyer since 2012, told me when we met at his offices in Landsberg am Lech, an ancient town about 20 minutes drive from Eching. \u201cThey tried several times to stop it going forward.\u201d The court insisted that an independent psychiatrist examine Michael, and to rule on whether his tinnitus was caused by the trial. After the psychiatrist confirmed it was, the case finally went ahead in 2016. It dragged on for more than two years. Unlike with the criminal trial, where the media focus was on Mazurek, it was now on Michael. He found himself having to explain to his pupils in his music and religion classes, who knew him as a reserved, kind teacher, why they were seeing his face in the newspapers and on TV. He took journalists to Eching, and into the forest where Ursula was kidnapped. Even so, apart from Herrmann\u2019s close family and friends, few understood why he was pursuing the case. A local journalist who covered the criminal and civil cases told me his newsroom colleagues often asked him why Herrmann \u201ccould not just let it go\u201d. \u201cI myself am still trying to work out why Michael Herrmann is acting like this,\u201d the journalist said. \u201cHe is quiet and calm, but still he looks into the files \u2026 There is a little obsession.\u201d As the civil trial went on, it became clear that he was not the only person with doubts about the original verdict. Appearing for the defence was a retired physicist and amateur sound expert named Bernd Haider, who had built his first tape recorder from scratch in the 1960s and lived in a village just a few miles from Eching. He vividly remembered the coverage of the crime from 1981, though he had never heard of Mazurek before his arrest. Haider had followed the 2009 trial in the media and, like Michael, was highly sceptical about the tape-recorder evidence. Later, he had borrowed a similar machine, got hold of the ransom call recordings, and tried to see if it was possible to replicate the phonetic expert\u2019s findings. After a year of testing, he concluded it was not, and offered his assistance to Mazurek\u2019s lawyer. When I visited Haider this spring, the borrowed tape recorder was still in his loft. After a lunch of wiener schnitzel and potatoes, he told me: \u201cMichael Herrmann was the only person in the original trial who understood what the problem with this evidence was. He said \u2018it\u2019s impossible\u2019, but he was sitting on the wrong side of the court!\u201d Towards the end of the civil case, Michael gained another ally. In London, a German academic named Barbara Zipser read an article online about his efforts to get to the truth. Zipser was a child in Germany when Ursula was kidnapped, and recalled the horror she felt then. In terms of its impact, it was the German equivalent of the Madeleine McCann case, Zipser told me when we met this year. \u201cI thought: whoever did this, I want that person in jail,\u201d she said. Since Zipser\u2019s speciality is linguistic profiling \u2013 at Royal Holloway, University of London, she uses modern profiling techniques to identify authors of ancient Greek medical texts \u2013 she decided to compare the ransom notes sent by the kidnappers to samples of Mazurek\u2019s writing, which Haider had posted on the internet. Zipser analysed the words used, and the writing style. Whoever composed the ransom notes was well educated, she said, a native speaker pretending to be a foreigner by writing in broken German. \u201cI am sure it was not Mazurek,\u201d Zipser told me. Her opinion only hardened after she went to meet Michael in Germany, and spent many hours going through the case files with him. \u201cI know this is an incredible story but I\u2019ve seen the evidence, and Michael has done very good investigative work,\u201d she said. \u201cI support him in his findings.\u201d For a few years after the criminal trial Michael thought there was still a 50% chance that Mazurek was the kidnapper. Now he puts it at 1%. In August 2018, the civil case concluded and the court ordered Mazurek to pay Michael \u20ac7,000 for causing his tinnitus. It was a victory that to Michael represented a loss, since to arrive at the decision the judges first needed to agree with the criminal court that Mazurek, together with an unidentified accomplice, was indeed the man who had kidnapped Ursula. In an open letter to the Bavarian state and the media, Michael wrote: \u201cMy sister\u2019s fate has stayed with me for 37 years, and to this day, it is unclear who was actually responsible for her death. Could it be that the Augsburg legal system is not actually interested in solving the case of Ursula Herrmann, the death of my little sister? \u2026 If the court decides to close the proverbial lid, it should be well aware that one cannot shut the truth away.\u201d * * * Since Mazurek was arrested in 2008, he has been represented by Walter Rubach, one of Bavaria\u2019s best-known defence lawyers. Rubach sees things in black and white. If a client asks him whether he believes in their innocence \u2013 as Mazurek did in 2008 \u2013 he brushes away the question. \u201cI told him I don\u2019t believe any of my clients,\u201d Rubach told me in his chambers in Augsburg. \u201cMy job is to work out if there\u2019s enough proof and evidence to convict them.\u201d In Mazurek\u2019s case he was convinced from the start that there wasn\u2019t. \u201cIt was clear that Mazurek was a person who could have committed something like that. But there were no hard facts \u2013 it was a circumstantial case at its finest,\u201d Rubach said. \u201cI am still upset at how he was convicted. What is it you say in England? Rather let 10 guilty men go free than hang one innocent one.\u201d Though Rubach has had little personal interaction with Michael, he has watched him across the court, and likes and admires him. \u201cWhat he has done, as a co-plaintiff, going against the decision of a court \u2013 this never happened before in Germany.\u201d From his prison cell in Germany\u2019s far north, Mazurek is still trying to clear his name. After I wrote to him this year, he replied saying he had hired a private investigator to track down the man who he says sold him the tape recorder in 2007. \u201cI am just angry and I am awaiting the 11th anniversary of my time in jail,\u201d he wrote. On a mild Sunday morning in April, I met Michael in Augsburg. As he had been most days in court, he was dressed casually, in trainers, blue jeans and a black jacket. Despite his legal setbacks, and the tinnitus that continues to bother him, he comes across as calm and warm, and possesses a dry sense of humour. As we drove through the Bavarian countryside towards Eching, he tried to explain the meaning of \u00fcberfordert, the word he used to describe the police in 1981: \u201cIt means when the task you have is bigger than your capabilities \u2013 like Brexit.\u201d Michael knows the case material so well \u2013 he has put in far more hours of research than any of the lawyers for the defence or prosecution \u2013 that when he speaks, it is with the precision and detachment of a special investigator, rather than a relative. After parking the car beside the road between Eching and Schondorf, he noted it was probably where the kidnappers had parked when bringing the box to the forest. An SUV track led into the woods. \u201cWe need to walk 141 metres,\u201d Michael said, and then look 20 metres to the left, to locate the spot where Ursula was buried. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if she was sedated and carried or if she was forced to walk there,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we know she was taken on paths specially cut through the forest.\u201d Michael\u2019s father died several years ago, and in 2016 his mother moved out of the family home in the village to Augsburg. But his younger brother Hannes \u2013 the surfer \u2013 still lives in the house, along with two Syrian refugees who rent out the bottom floor. Michael phoned him \u2013 he did not want to show up with a journalist, unannounced \u2013 and Hannes invited us in for coffee. We never spoke about Ursula. As with his oldest sister and their mother, Hannes has never talked to the media about his sister\u2019s death, though Michael says that in private his family supports his work on the case, as do his children and his new partner. But in public, at least, he is alone in his quest to reopen the case. After lunch at a restaurant beside the lake, where sailboats bobbed in the distance, we walked along the road towards the forest, the route Ursula took on her way to gym class nearly 40 years ago. The spruce trees are much taller than they were then, and the undergrowth less thick, but the path is the same: three metres wide, compact gravel. Cyclists on electric bikes sped by. After a few minutes, as we neared a small jetty leading to a wooden hut used by bathers, Michael stopped on the path. \u201cThis is where Ursula was kidnapped,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s where her bike was found and where the bell-wire ended.\u201d The bell-wire is the 140m-long coil of insulated copper wire the kidnappers used as part of a warning system. Though the police had noticed the wire while searching for Ursula, they only learned of its significance more than a year later, when investigators visited the private boarding school in Schondorf to talk to pupils about the case. Two students came forward, saying that seven or eight months after the kidnapping, when chasing an owl through the forest, they had found the bell-wire strung through the trees next to the lakeside path. The boys then did a very strange thing: they took the wire down, measured it on the school athletics track, and then kept it in their dormitory in a locked box, until the police visit. On examining the wire, the investigators realised it must have been used during Ursula\u2019s abduction. While one of the kidnappers waited for the victim, the other presumably served as a lookout further along the path, with their finger on a button that would light up a bulb or sound a buzzer at the other end of the wire. Michael believes the wire is one of the key pieces of evidence that could help identify the real kidnappers. Besides hunters, joggers and cyclists, the boarding school pupils also knew the forest well. Yet it appears that none of them were fingerprinted at the time of the investigation. Another piece of evidence also hints at the possible involvement of younger people in the plot: an impression on the paper of one of the ransom notes revealed a mathematical probability tree, of the sort taught to teenagers. Michael also notes that in a comic found in the box, one of the main characters drives a Fiat 600, the car that was mentioned in the ransom note and which was rare in Germany at the time, suggesting the kidnappers may have read the comic. Late last year, in an effort to have the case reopened, Michael submitted a dossier of all his new evidence and theories to the state prosecutor\u2019s office in Augsburg. In April, when I interviewed Matthias Nickolai, spokesman for the public prosecutor, he acknowledged that many people still had questions about the verdict in the criminal trial, but insisted the judges had arrived at the correct decision in 2010, and that it was \u201cfinal and absolute\u201d. In August, this became official, when the prosecutor\u2019s office announced it would not be reopening the case. Through his lawyer, Michael told the local press that he would be making no more public statements about the case, nor giving interviews, which the media interpreted as him finally giving up. But when I emailed him recently he said this was not true. \u201cI didn\u2019t say that I am not going to take it any further,\u201d he wrote. On 15 September, a few days after I received that message, it was the 38th anniversary of Ursula\u2019s kidnapping and death. As they have done for the last few years, Michael, along with his two siblings and his mother, travelled to the graveyard in Eching where Ursula is buried. Just the four of them, no partners. There they remembered the little girl who left her cousin\u2019s house on her red bike on a summer\u2019s evening and never came home. \u2022",

The new farms, which would provide electricity for 57m homes, were needed because the construction of new turbines by the private sector was too slow, despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/20/new-windfarms-taxpayers-subsidies-record-low\">falling costs</a>, she said. The profits from the power generation would be reinvested to benefit coastal communities and tackle the climate emergency.</p> <p>Public ownership would ensure jobs and revenue stayed in the UK, she added. \u201c[We can] learn from countries such as Norway and Sweden by owning what is already ours,\u201d she said. \u201cBy taking a stake in offshore wind, we can collectively benefit from the profits, investing them back in our held-back coastal communities. Instead of jackets for windfarms in Scotland being made in Indonesia, we\u2019ll bring those jobs back to Fife.\u201d</p> <p>Labour would invest \u00a36.2bn from its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/07/labour-would-break-up-treasury-and-create-northern-no-11-says-john-mcdonnell\">proposed \u00a3250bn </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/07/labour-would-break-up-treasury-and-create-northern-no-11-says-john-mcdonnell\">national </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/07/labour-would-break-up-treasury-and-create-northern-no-11-says-john-mcdonnell\">transformation </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/07/labour-would-break-up-treasury-and-create-northern-no-11-says-john-mcdonnell\">fund</a> in the new windfarms, along with a matching amount from the regional energy agencies which would replace the renationalised National Grid. The remaining \u00a370bn would be sought from private sector investors, and the new windfarms would be 51% owned by the public.</p> <p>A projected \u00a3600m to \u00a31bn a year in profits would go to coastal communities for amenities such as harbour fronts, parks, leisure centres and libraries, with the remainder invested in improvements to the energy system and measures to combat global heating.</p> <p>Other \u201cgreen industrial revolution\u201d proposals include a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/23/labour-to-commit-to-big-increase-in-charging-points-for-electric-cars\">\u00a33.6bn national network of electric vehicle charging stations</a>, solar panels for low-income and social housing tenants, and a programme of insulation for fuel-poor households.</p> <p>Sue Ferns, senior deputy general secretary at the Prospect union, said: \u201cThis focus on how to drive up low-carbon generation while lowering costs and encouraging quality unionised UK jobs is welcome. It is essential that we retain the jobs and skills that we have in traditional [power] generation and create new jobs \u2013 a strong government role could be central to delivering that.\u201d</p> <p>Businesses have been more cautious on the green industrial plan. James Diggle, head of energy and climate change at the CBI employers\u2019 organisation, said: \u201cFirms will welcome the Labour party making growth in low-carbon technologies and green jobs a priority. The emphasis on increasing renewable energy is backed by the business [community]. To meet net zero emissions by 2050 we need ambitious policy. Labour\u2019s proposals to invest in energy efficiency, introduce a zero-carbon homes policy and support uptake of low-emission vehicles all support this ambition.\u201d</p> <p>But he added: \u201cIn the huge push to reach net zero as fast and as cost-effectively as possible, renationalisation will disrupt the investment needed across water, rail and energy that all contribute to reducing emissions.\u201d</p>",

She pointed to the proposals for new offshore windfarms as a prime example of how the strategy would work. The new farms, which would provide electricity for 57m homes, were needed because the construction of new turbines by the private sector was too slow, despite falling costs, she said. The profits from the power generation would be reinvested to benefit coastal communities and tackle the climate emergency. Public ownership would ensure jobs and revenue stayed in the UK, she added. \u201c[We can] learn from countries such as Norway and Sweden by owning what is already ours,\u201d she said. \u201cBy taking a stake in offshore wind, we can collectively benefit from the profits, investing them back in our held-back coastal communities. Instead of jackets for windfarms in Scotland being made in Indonesia, we\u2019ll bring those jobs back to Fife.\u201d Labour would invest \u00a36.2bn from its proposed \u00a3250bn national transformation fund in the new windfarms, along with a matching amount from the regional energy agencies which would replace the renationalised National Grid. The remaining \u00a370bn would be sought from private sector investors, and the new windfarms would be 51% owned by the public. A projected \u00a3600m to \u00a31bn a year in profits would go to coastal communities for amenities such as harbour fronts, parks, leisure centres and libraries, with the remainder invested in improvements to the energy system and measures to combat global heating. Other \u201cgreen industrial revolution\u201d proposals include a \u00a33.6bn national network of electric vehicle charging stations, solar panels for low-income and social housing tenants, and a programme of insulation for fuel-poor households. Sue Ferns, senior deputy general secretary at the Prospect union, said: \u201cThis focus on how to drive up low-carbon generation while lowering costs and encouraging quality unionised UK jobs is welcome. It is essential that we retain the jobs and skills that we have in traditional [power] generation and create new jobs \u2013 a strong government role could be central to delivering that.\u201d Businesses have been more cautious on the green industrial plan. James Diggle, head of energy and climate change at the CBI employers\u2019 organisation, said: \u201cFirms will welcome the Labour party making growth in low-carbon technologies and green jobs a priority. The emphasis on increasing renewable energy is backed by the business [community]. To meet net zero emissions by 2050 we need ambitious policy. Labour\u2019s proposals to invest in energy efficiency, introduce a zero-carbon homes policy and support uptake of low-emission vehicles all support this ambition.\u201d But he added: \u201cIn the huge push to reach net zero as fast and as cost-effectively as possible, renationalisation will disrupt the investment needed across water, rail and energy that all contribute to reducing emissions.\u201d",

He was living in supported accommodation provided by a local YMCA which works across Sussex and beyond, housing more than 700 young people with different levels of need, many of whom have experienced homelessness.</p> \n<p>Their needs are complex: mental ill health, drug and alcohol abuse, low self-esteem. They need intensive support as they move to more independent living within the YMCA. Jake was known to local service providers, including the YMCA, and questions need to be asked about why he wasn\u2019t getting the level of support he needed. Ultimately, he was badly let down.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"84dedb16-06c2-41d2-a5b0-116bf808392e\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/s_pgvN6SCvY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The issue does not, however, lie solely with YMCA DownsLink, which had care of Jake. It lies squarely with the government and its austerity programme which, far from supporting vulnerable young people, has sought to whittle away what little help they had. It has slashed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/oct/31/youth-work-cuts-young-people-councils\">youth support services</a>, tried to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/mar/06/housing-benefit-cuts-young-people-homelessness-landlords\">deny them housing benefit</a> until <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/29/ban-on-housing-benefit-for-18-to-21-year-olds-scrapped\">forced into a U-turn</a>, capped the amount of rent that housing benefit would cover in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/07/uk-housing-crisis-deepens-as-benefit-claimants-priced-out-by-high-rents\">social and private sector</a>, and then, to add salt to the wound, put policies in place which starved housing associations of income so they were unable to build the social homes that are so desperately needed. Supported housing projects were particularly hard hit, losing hundreds of thousands of pounds. The first service to go? Support for vulnerable residents.</p> \n<p>The failing is worse than that. Any institution providing care \u2013 whether for patients, children or elderly or disabled people \u2013 should be regulated and subject to inspection. But with some vulnerable children being placed in unregulated homes because of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/oct/10/judge-condemns-unacceptable-lack-of-secure-accommodation-for-children\">a lack of \u201csecure beds\u201d</a>, there are huge gaps in supervision and accountability which urgently need addressing. A <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-49673455\">BBC investigation</a> recently reported that thousands of teenagers and young adults across the country have been placed in these homes, many run by private companies accountable to shareholders with no official oversight because they are not care homes. That is a scandal.</p> \n<p>The government puts responsibility for inspecting these homes on local councils who place young people in their care. But this is not a statutory requirement, and unsurprisingly proper inspections have fallen victim to savage austerity cuts, leaving thousands of young people at risk.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/sep/24/homelessness-is-now-part-of-all-our-lives-heres-what-you-can-do-to-help\">Homelessness is now part of all our lives. Here's what you can do to help</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The government is belatedly waking up to this and says unregulated accommodation may need to be licensed and registered to keep children safe \u2013 a completely inadequate response. It continues to ignore calls from the children\u2019s commissioner for proper regulation. Nationwide, that means some 5,000 looked-after children in England, supposedly in the care of their local children\u2019s services, are being housed in supported accommodation which is not inspected or registered by Ofsted, the Care Quality Commission or anyone else. It\u2019s hardly surprising that stories are now emerging of organised abuse at some of these homes. YMCA DownsLink is a registered social housing provider, and is itself calling for a new regulatory framework for supported housing. That\u2019s a call that I support.</p> \n<p>This country has been living with a housing crisis for decades, and Brighton has been particularly hard hit. The mass sale of social housing since the 1980s has enriched some families and left hundreds of thousands of others at the mercy of private landlords. Too many privately rented homes are substandard, and families are vulnerable to being made homeless because of sudden rent rises or unjust evictions.</p> \n<p>Destitution, rough sleeping and homelessness are on the rise and so are the social problems that go with them. It would be tempting to say this is a hidden problem. But it\u2019s not hidden; we can all see it. Organisations such as the YMCA are there to help some at risk of falling through the cracks. Organisations providing care for young people should be properly regulated and held to account when they fail in that duty.</p> \n<p><em>Caroline Lucas is the Green MP for Brighton Pavilion</em></p> \n<p><em>In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or by emailing <a href=\"mailto://jo@samaritans.org\" title=\"\">jo@samaritans.org</a> or <a href=\"mailto://jo@samaritans.ie\" title=\"\">jo@samaritans.ie</a>.

I am angry, too, at the continuing toll of deaths in sheltered accommodation in Brighton and the surrounding area, where 31 homeless people temporarily housed by the council have died in only two years. If this number of deaths was happening among any other sector of the population, it would be a national scandal, dominating the front pages. Instead, it is barely mentioned. It seems we don\u2019t just walk past people living on the streets; we ignore their deaths as well. Jake was one of my constituents. He was living in supported accommodation provided by a local YMCA which works across Sussex and beyond, housing more than 700 young people with different levels of need, many of whom have experienced homelessness. Their needs are complex: mental ill health, drug and alcohol abuse, low self-esteem. They need intensive support as they move to more independent living within the YMCA. Jake was known to local service providers, including the YMCA, and questions need to be asked about why he wasn\u2019t getting the level of support he needed. Ultimately, he was badly let down. The issue does not, however, lie solely with YMCA DownsLink, which had care of Jake. It lies squarely with the government and its austerity programme which, far from supporting vulnerable young people, has sought to whittle away what little help they had. It has slashed youth support services, tried to deny them housing benefit until forced into a U-turn, capped the amount of rent that housing benefit would cover in the social and private sector, and then, to add salt to the wound, put policies in place which starved housing associations of income so they were unable to build the social homes that are so desperately needed. Supported housing projects were particularly hard hit, losing hundreds of thousands of pounds. The first service to go? Support for vulnerable residents. The failing is worse than that. Any institution providing care \u2013 whether for patients, children or elderly or disabled people \u2013 should be regulated and subject to inspection. But with some vulnerable children being placed in unregulated homes because of a lack of \u201csecure beds\u201d, there are huge gaps in supervision and accountability which urgently need addressing. A BBC investigation recently reported that thousands of teenagers and young adults across the country have been placed in these homes, many run by private companies accountable to shareholders with no official oversight because they are not care homes. That is a scandal. The government puts responsibility for inspecting these homes on local councils who place young people in their care. But this is not a statutory requirement, and unsurprisingly proper inspections have fallen victim to savage austerity cuts, leaving thousands of young people at risk. The government is belatedly waking up to this and says unregulated accommodation may need to be licensed and registered to keep children safe \u2013 a completely inadequate response. It continues to ignore calls from the children\u2019s commissioner for proper regulation. Nationwide, that means some 5,000 looked-after children in England, supposedly in the care of their local children\u2019s services, are being housed in supported accommodation which is not inspected or registered by Ofsted, the Care Quality Commission or anyone else. It\u2019s hardly surprising that stories are now emerging of organised abuse at some of these homes. YMCA DownsLink is a registered social housing provider, and is itself calling for a new regulatory framework for supported housing. That\u2019s a call that I support. This country has been living with a housing crisis for decades, and Brighton has been particularly hard hit. The mass sale of social housing since the 1980s has enriched some families and left hundreds of thousands of others at the mercy of private landlords. Too many privately rented homes are substandard, and families are vulnerable to being made homeless because of sudden rent rises or unjust evictions. Destitution, rough sleeping and homelessness are on the rise and so are the social problems that go with them. It would be tempting to say this is a hidden problem. But it\u2019s not hidden; we can all see it. Organisations such as the YMCA are there to help some at risk of falling through the cracks. Organisations providing care for young people should be properly regulated and held to account when they fail in that duty.

      "body": "<p>Britain\u2019s homelessness crisis is out of control, with the numbers of homeless people and rough sleepers at their highest levels since 2010. Every day on the commute to work, the school run or shopping trips we pass the tent cities, flattened cardboard boxes lining doorways and paper cups resting on pavements. Homelessness is now part of all our lives. It leaves many of us feeling compelled to help, but unsure of how to do it in the right way.</p> \n<p>I\u2019ve experienced homelessness. I slept rough in a campsite and on a bridle path for three weeks before living in hostels for more than 18 months. These experiences haven\u2019t provided me with any special wisdom on the matter. In fact I\u2019m probably just as unsure as most of you are. But one thing I am sure about, and that my own experiences underlined, is that homeless people are just that \u2013 people. Take that as your starting point: treat them as you would want to be treated if you ever found yourself in that situation.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f19c6dbd-a8c5-44ad-a2f7-cde781d9ee47\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>726 homeless people died in England and Wales in 2018, according to the latest ONS figures.

We will tell not just the story of their death, but the story of their life \u2013 what they were like as kids, what their dreams were, their hobbies, what people loved about them, what was infuriating. We will also examine what went wrong with their lives, how it impacted on their loved ones, and if anything could have been done differently to prevent their deaths.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>As the series develops, we will invite politicians, charities and homelessness organisations to respond to the issues raised. We will also ask readers to offer their own stories and reflections on homelessness. We want the stories we tell to become the fulcrum of a debate about homelessness; to make a difference to a scourge that shames us all.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>It is time to stop just passing by.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Here are my thoughts on what the rest of us \u2013 the passers-by, the lookers-on, those who feel anxious and powerless \u2013 should do. Some of my suggestions are controversial and, as I said, I don\u2019t feel I\u2019ve got all the answers, but I\u2019ve tried to be honest about the way I feel and about the lessons I learned from being on the streets and from talking to other people in a similar situation then and since, as part of my work with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/sep/17/were-telling-the-stories-of-those-who-died-homeless-heres-why\">Simon Hattenstone on The Empty Doorway</a> series.</p> \n<h2><strong>Reporting</strong></h2> \n<p>What should you do if you see a rough sleeper whose immediate welfare you are concerned about? In England and Wales, the official advice is to <a href=\"https://www.streetlink.org.uk/\">inform StreetLink</a>, the national referral service run by <a href=\"https://www.mungos.org/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI59nkuOna5AIVkEDTCh2INQKJEAAYASAAEgKrHfD_BwE\">St Mungo\u2019s</a>. This seems like a no-brainer: contact StreetLink and they will send an experienced person along who will attempt to get that person off the streets. But even this isn\u2019t straightforward. St Mungo\u2019s, in co-operation with the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/aug/27/hostile-environment-anatomy-of-a-policy-disaster\">hostile environment policy</a>, were found to be recording the details of those they help and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/05/st-mungos-homeless-charity-helped-target-rough-sleepers-to-deport\">passing that information to the Home Office</a>.</p> \n<p>This was stopped in 2017, but rough sleepers still don\u2019t trust them. Many of the rough sleepers I\u2019ve spoken to, even British citizens, refuse help from StreetLink over privacy concerns. This lack of trust is <a href=\"https://www.citymetric.com/politics/rough-sleepers-could-ignore-life-saving-services-fear-deportation-3749\">having a big impact</a> in stopping rough sleepers getting the help they need. It\u2019s vital that homelessness charities demonstrate their independence from government and start winning back trust.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/sep/17/homeless-deaths-share-your-tributes\">Homeless deaths: share your tributes</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>We also need to better understand what the practical results of referrals to these types of services are. There is evidence that <a href=\"https://www.bigissue.com/latest/what-happens-when-you-refer-a-rough-sleeper-with-streetlink/\">a large proportion of the people referred are already known</a> to the authorities, which suggests that the services to which StreetLink are supposed to refer them are already failing.</p> \n<p>It also proves difficult in many instances for StreetLink to identify or locate the person who has been reported. That\u2019s why it\u2019s crucial, if you have decided to report, to give as accurate and detailed a description of the person and their location as possible.</p> \n<p>If you are worried that a homeless person is in immediate danger, perhaps suffering from hypothermia or the effects of drugs, then you should call an ambulance or contact the police. That is doubly true if the person is under 18, as StreetLink only deals with adults. If you are reporting someone to the emergency services, it is best to stay with or close to that person until the police or ambulance crew arrive. But if your anxiety is more generalised or if, as is often the case, it is someone you see on your street frequently and whose condition is perhaps deteriorating, engage with them. Try to understand their situation, see if they want to be referred \u2013 give them as much agency as possible. Help that person make informed decisions; don\u2019t try to impose your decisions on them.</p> \n<h2><strong>Relating</strong></h2> \n<p>It can be daunting to approach someone on the street you are worried about. One thing that irritates homeless people is when you talk to them as though they are children. There is nothing more humiliating than having someone stooping over you, literally talking down to you. Sit down, share a drink or fag or bar of chocolate with them; tell them about your day; ask them about theirs, whether they\u2019re getting enough help and if there\u2019s anything else you can do. Obviously use your judgment. If they don\u2019t seem receptive to conversation don\u2019t thrust it on them. Maybe just give them a few quid and get on with your day.</p> \n<h2><strong>Donating</strong></h2> \n<p>The big homelessness charities are almost unanimously against people handing over cash to rough sleepers. The argument for this is perfectly cogent: a lot of rough sleepers suffer with substance dependency, and giving them money allows them to buy more drugs and alcohol, which makes their lives worse. But put yourself in their position. Do you reckon you might want a wee tipple to take the edge off sleeping rough? Of course you would, so why shouldn\u2019t they? In fact why not share a can or two with your new homeless mate? Remember, they\u2019re just people after all.</p> \n<p>If you\u2019re really worried about donating a fiver that turns out to be lethal, you can always offer to buy them some food or drink. Don\u2019t pre-buy these. Ask the person what they want. It\u2019s nice to be given choices when you feel like your life is out of control. It restores your humanity.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"26a48e67bbe258bee871b776deceeb16832afbc1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26a48e67bbe258bee871b776deceeb16832afbc1/0_22_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Campaigning is one way to help find long term solutions to the homelessness crisis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Campaigning is one way to help find long-term solutions to the homelessness crisis.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Lawless/PA Wire/PA Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>And of course if you don\u2019t want to donate directly to someone on the streets, charities will be happy to take your money (and will argue that donations, particularly regular ones, help them to plan and provide longer-term support). Their shops are also very pleased to receive good-quality products they can sell on. And as temperatures start to drop, there will be plenty of one-off appeals for you to donate a warm coat you no longer need, for example.</p> \n<h2><strong>Volunteering</strong></h2> \n<p>If you\u2019re convinced that handing over cash is not the way, you can volunteer for one of the many homelessness charities . For a start, there are outreach teams you can join, where you\u2019ll work with like-minded people to distribute food, drink and clothes. Lots of people volunteer for Crisis at Christmas, and that\u2019s great, but this is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/dec/10/no-room-at-the-inn-uk-homeless-charities-turn-away-xmas-volunteers\">year-round emergency</a>. Charities are always looking for long-term volunteers to work in their shops and fundraise but also to act as mentors and night shelter workers.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s homelessness crisis is out of control, with the numbers of homeless people and rough sleepers at their highest levels since 2010. Every day on the commute to work, the school run or shopping trips we pass the tent cities, flattened cardboard boxes lining doorways and paper cups resting on pavements. Homelessness is now part of all our lives. It leaves many of us feeling compelled to help, but unsure of how to do it in the right way. I\u2019ve experienced homelessness. I slept rough in a campsite and on a bridle path for three weeks before living in hostels for more than 18 months. These experiences haven\u2019t provided me with any special wisdom on the matter. In fact I\u2019m probably just as unsure as most of you are. But one thing I am sure about, and that my own experiences underlined, is that homeless people are just that \u2013 people. Take that as your starting point: treat them as you would want to be treated if you ever found yourself in that situation. Here are my thoughts on what the rest of us \u2013 the passers-by, the lookers-on, those who feel anxious and powerless \u2013 should do. Some of my suggestions are controversial and, as I said, I don\u2019t feel I\u2019ve got all the answers, but I\u2019ve tried to be honest about the way I feel and about the lessons I learned from being on the streets and from talking to other people in a similar situation then and since, as part of my work with Simon Hattenstone on The Empty Doorway series. Reporting What should you do if you see a rough sleeper whose immediate welfare you are concerned about? In England and Wales, the official advice is to inform StreetLink, the national referral service run by St Mungo\u2019s. This seems like a no-brainer: contact StreetLink and they will send an experienced person along who will attempt to get that person off the streets. But even this isn\u2019t straightforward. St Mungo\u2019s, in co-operation with the government\u2019s hostile environment policy, were found to be recording the details of those they help and passing that information to the Home Office. This was stopped in 2017, but rough sleepers still don\u2019t trust them. Many of the rough sleepers I\u2019ve spoken to, even British citizens, refuse help from StreetLink over privacy concerns. This lack of trust is having a big impact in stopping rough sleepers getting the help they need. It\u2019s vital that homelessness charities demonstrate their independence from government and start winning back trust. We also need to better understand what the practical results of referrals to these types of services are. There is evidence that a large proportion of the people referred are already known to the authorities, which suggests that the services to which StreetLink are supposed to refer them are already failing. It also proves difficult in many instances for StreetLink to identify or locate the person who has been reported. That\u2019s why it\u2019s crucial, if you have decided to report, to give as accurate and detailed a description of the person and their location as possible. If you are worried that a homeless person is in immediate danger, perhaps suffering from hypothermia or the effects of drugs, then you should call an ambulance or contact the police. That is doubly true if the person is under 18, as StreetLink only deals with adults. If you are reporting someone to the emergency services, it is best to stay with or close to that person until the police or ambulance crew arrive. But if your anxiety is more generalised or if, as is often the case, it is someone you see on your street frequently and whose condition is perhaps deteriorating, engage with them. Try to understand their situation, see if they want to be referred \u2013 give them as much agency as possible. Help that person make informed decisions; don\u2019t try to impose your decisions on them. Relating It can be daunting to approach someone on the street you are worried about. One thing that irritates homeless people is when you talk to them as though they are children. There is nothing more humiliating than having someone stooping over you, literally talking down to you. Sit down, share a drink or fag or bar of chocolate with them; tell them about your day; ask them about theirs, whether they\u2019re getting enough help and if there\u2019s anything else you can do. Obviously use your judgment. If they don\u2019t seem receptive to conversation don\u2019t thrust it on them. Maybe just give them a few quid and get on with your day. Donating The big homelessness charities are almost unanimously against people handing over cash to rough sleepers. The argument for this is perfectly cogent: a lot of rough sleepers suffer with substance dependency, and giving them money allows them to buy more drugs and alcohol, which makes their lives worse. But put yourself in their position. Do you reckon you might want a wee tipple to take the edge off sleeping rough? Of course you would, so why shouldn\u2019t they? In fact why not share a can or two with your new homeless mate? Remember, they\u2019re just people after all. If you\u2019re really worried about donating a fiver that turns out to be lethal, you can always offer to buy them some food or drink. Don\u2019t pre-buy these. Ask the person what they want. It\u2019s nice to be given choices when you feel like your life is out of control. It restores your humanity. And of course if you don\u2019t want to donate directly to someone on the streets, charities will be happy to take your money (and will argue that donations, particularly regular ones, help them to plan and provide longer-term support). Their shops are also very pleased to receive good-quality products they can sell on. And as temperatures start to drop, there will be plenty of one-off appeals for you to donate a warm coat you no longer need, for example. Volunteering If you\u2019re convinced that handing over cash is not the way, you can volunteer for one of the many homelessness charities . For a start, there are outreach teams you can join, where you\u2019ll work with like-minded people to distribute food, drink and clothes. Lots of people volunteer for Crisis at Christmas, and that\u2019s great, but this is a year-round emergency. Charities are always looking for long-term volunteers to work in their shops and fundraise but also to act as mentors and night shelter workers. They will usually try to make use of any particular skills you have \u2013 cooking, IT, advocacy and legal knowledge. More challengingly, some charities look for hosts who are willing to give short-term emergency accommodation to homeless people, especially young adults. This will not be for everyone and demands a high level of commitment on the part of the volunteer, who may often have social work or other relevant experience, but the success of the Nightstop UK scheme shows what can be achieved. Campaigning If your concerns go beyond what you see on the streets and you want to help find long-term solutions to this mounting crisis, you could always write to your MP with your suggestions, or join \u2013 or better still, organise! \u2013 a campaign aimed at putting pressure on the government or your local authority. One of the most worrying things I discovered when I experienced the care system and homelessness was the fact that many of the essential services tasked with helping people had been outsourced by local authorities and were now the remit of the third sector. Although there are many good third sector providers, including charities and voluntary organisations, they all have their own philosophies and practices, making the quality of support pot luck from region to region.

He was even beginning to make inroads into the music industry: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSWad-KS9Dk\" title=\"\">in January 2018, he joined in a filmed session</a> with the hugely successful singer-songwriter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/rag-n-bone-man\" title=\"\">Rag</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/rag-n-bone-man\" title=\"\">\u2019n\u2019</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/rag-n-bone-man\" title=\"\">Bone Man</a>. But in the end, Resilient J wasn\u2019t quite resilient enough. After losing a close friend to suicide and witnessing another overdosing, he relapsed. A three-week drinking binge followed, before he killed himself on 29 August 2018. Jake was 22.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--thumbnail\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=48&amp;title=estimated%20homeless%20deaths%20in%20Brighton%20between%202013%20and%202017\" data-alt=\"48 estimated homeless deaths in Brighton between 2013 and 2017\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=48&amp;title=estimated%20homeless%20deaths%20in%20Brighton%20between%202013%20and%202017\">48 estimated homeless deaths in Brighton between 2013 and 2017</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Suicide is the second-biggest killer of homeless people in the UK, and Brighton has one of the highest suicide rates in the country. The city is a transient place: great for holidaymakers and day trippers, but tough for many people growing up there. Austerity has rattled Brighton, producing a lack of secure employment and affordable housing, which has led to some of the highest rates of rough sleeping and homelessness outside London. Cuts have decimated social care and education, contributing to a mounting youth crisis and communities where one in three children are living in poverty. At the same time, the influx of wealthier people (often second-home owners) to the city has increased house prices.</p> \n<p>Jake didn\u2019t leave a suicide note. It is impossible to know exactly what was going through his mind at the end. But the more you look into this life, the more you see all these elements coming into play \u2013 transience, loneliness, cuts to social care and support groups, unregulated services and, ultimately, institutional failings.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"66bba85bbc3031fec07b8300322ad6aa920b5e07\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66bba85bbc3031fec07b8300322ad6aa920b5e07/0_105_1620_972/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jake Humm (right) with his father Joules.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jake Humm (right) with his father Joules.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Joules Humm</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>We meet Jake\u2019s father in a cafe on Brighton\u2019s seafront, underneath the bandstand where Jake loved to hang out with friends.

It is nine months since he died, and Joules is still staggering towards an understanding and acceptance of what happened. Jake was his only child, his fishing partner, his soulmate. And yet, as is so often the case, there were tensions; they bickered and, ultimately, couldn\u2019t live with each other.</p> \n<p>Hunter had known Jake for years. She says he adored his father, and tells us how she and Joules would work together, behind his back, to try to keep Jake\u2019s life on track. She talks about Jake with huge affection and emotion. She is also, perhaps unsurprisingly, a little defensive.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>He was one of our young people.

It was Joules who introduced Jake to music (all sorts, from Led Zeppelin to Eminem), taught him how to fish and encouraged his tidiness, which later became a fixation. But there was more. Joules knew exactly how tough it could be for young people, men in particular, trying to make their way in Brighton. He had moved there from London as a young man. Like Jake, he was creative, funny and handsome. Like Jake, he had struggled to make ends meet, battled depression and alcoholism (he last drank eight years ago) and spent time sofa surfing and in temporary accommodation. There is little that Jake went through that his father didn\u2019t understand. Joules says there were times when he, too, was suicidal.</p> \n<p>Joules says he and his son always had a special bond. Jake\u2019s parents split up when he was about four;<strong> </strong>Joules says he was denied custody because he was living in temporary accommodation. Four years later, when Joules was settled, Jake moved into a flat with him.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f19c6dbd-a8c5-44ad-a2f7-cde781d9ee47\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>726 homeless people died in England and Wales in 2018, according to the latest ONS figures.

At the age of seven, he was a star of the local football team, Saltdean United. Joules says he showed a rare maturity. \u201cIf someone was not pulling their weight in a certain position, rather than stand up front for the glory, Jake would drop into that position.\u201d But in other ways, he struggled. School didn\u2019t know what to do with Jake. He was bright, good with words, but he couldn\u2019t settle. He played truant, and was disruptive when he did turn up.</p> \n<p>At the age of 14, he was being seen by the child and adolescent mental health services. Eventually, he was diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder. He wasn\u2019t violent or aggressive, but he was pig-headed. He would find daft, random ways of getting into trouble at school. Joules tells the story of the marrow. \u201cHe went into a biology classroom and he picked up a marrow that the year below were growing, and one of the kids said: \u2018You can have it, Jake.\u2019\u201d When the teachers asked him to return it, he refused, telling them it was a gift. He was deliberately winding them up. But the game got out of hand. By the end of the day, it had become a perverse matter of principle. \u201cJake climbed up on the school roof and launched it across the playground so nobody could have it,\u201d says Joules. \u201cThat\u2019s when he got into trouble, because it could have hit somebody.\u201d</p> \n<p>It is such a mild act of rebellion, yet somehow it sums up Jake\u2019s brooding sense of injustice, that all was not well with the world. On social media he would vent his anger at all that was wrong with society. He became a conspiracy theorist, convinced that the US government was behind the bombing of the twin towers.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"fb73f28dc6c991ca6b1b2e6f6891693dc06d1f5c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb73f28dc6c991ca6b1b2e6f6891693dc06d1f5c/0_519_5724_3435/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joules Humm has dedicated his left arm to tattooed references to his late son, Jake.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joules Humm has dedicated his left arm to tattooed references to his late son, Jake.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Flude/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>He was 16, still at school and already drinking too much when he decided to leave home. Joules agreed it was the best thing. There were no dramas, he says; they just needed their own space. \u201cThe relationship didn\u2019t break down, but both of us could see where it was going. Maybe it was an alpha-male thing. It wasn\u2019t a case of me saying: \u2018Jake, you\u2019ve gotta go.\u2019 It was kind of a mutual thing. It was quite calm; it wasn\u2019t ugly.\u201d</p> \n<p>Jake moved into accommodation at the YMCA in Brighton, a supported hostel with space for up to 15 residents. Hunter remembers that the first time she saw him he was wearing his school uniform. He was drinking more and more heavily, and started as he meant to go on \u2013 with spirits. We ask Joules where he got the money. Joules smiles and says he doesn\u2019t think the local Co-op would have been best pleased with his son. When Jake wasn\u2019t drinking, he would become agitated. At times, he would self-harm.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--thumbnail\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=4%2C317&amp;title=number%20of%20homeless%C2%A0%0Apeople%20in%20Brighton%20and%20Hove%20%E2%80%93%201%20in%2067%20of%20the%20population\" data-alt=\"4,317 number of homeless&nbsp;people in Brighton and Hove - 1 in 67 of the population\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=4%2C317&amp;title=number%20of%20homeless%C2%A0%0Apeople%20in%20Brighton%20and%20Hove%20%E2%80%93%201%20in%2067%20of%20the%20population\">4,317 number of homeless&nbsp;people in Brighton and Hove - 1 in 67 of the population</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Alcohol is strictly prohibited at the YMCA.

He bounced around every kind of housing project throughout Brighton, Newhaven and further afield. He and Joules remained close, but they knew it wouldn\u2019t work if he moved back in. Jake had admitted that there were numerous occasions when he was offered help and refused it.</p> \n<p>In October 2016, as he turned 21, he decided to take himself in hand and checked into a 10-day detox programme in London. At the end of that month, Jake announced to his Facebook friends: \u201cA new chapter in my life is on the horizon, a life without drink an drugs, no doubt my demons will wanna war but [it\u2019s] a war I\u2019m gonna win!!! bring on tomorrow!\u201d</p> \n<p>For a long time, it looked as if he was winning it. After kicking the booze, he got back into shape, took on voluntary work and strengthened his relationship with his father. Jake and Joules spent weeks together camped out on lakes, catching and posing with carp the size of pitbulls. For the first time in five years, Jake moved back in with the YMCA \u2013 this time into semi-independent accommodation, which he hoped would be a stepping stone towards independence. He also embarked on a period of ferocious creativity.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>T<a href=\"http://audioactive.org.uk/about-us/\">he music organisation AudioActive</a> is based in an old warehouse in Brighton. It looks like any old ramshackle building, until you enter and discover a rabbit warren of recording studios. AudioActive helps young people express themselves through music, and this is where Jake created some of his best work. For almost two years after Jake became clean, he attended a weekly session called Room to Rant, which provided just that. He was one of half a dozen struggling young men who turned up to express their anger, frustration and talent through music. Jake was older than most of his fellow ranters, but younger than the youth workers who supported them. He ended up close to both groups.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--thumbnail\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=178&amp;title=number%20of%20street%20homeless%20people%20in%20Brighton%20and%20Hove%20in%202017%20%E2%80%93%20second%20only%20to%20Westminster%20among%20England's%20local%20authorities\" data-alt=\"178 number of street homeless people in Brighton and Hove in 2017 - second only to Westminster among England's local authorities\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=178&amp;title=number%20of%20street%20homeless%20people%20in%20Brighton%20and%20Hove%20in%202017%20%E2%80%93%20second%20only%20to%20Westminster%20among%20England's%20local%20authorities\">178 number of street homeless people in Brighton and Hove in 2017 - second only to Westminster among England's local authorities</a> \n</figure> \n<p>In the video with Rag\u2019n\u2019Bone Man, Jake explained what Room to Rant had done for him. \u201cThere\u2019s not enough places for young men to be able to express themselves and express their feelings. Whatever it is on your mind, you can come here and you\u2019re not going to be judged for it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to have someone looking down their nose, like: \u2018Oh, you\u2019re weak, or you\u2019re vulnerable,\u2019 because we\u2019re not. We just have trouble sometimes with life.\u201d</p> \n<p>Tom Hines, AudioActive\u2019s project manager, leads us to a studio where we meet four of Jake\u2019s friends. Olly and Rob are regular ranters, while Ed Hallwood and Jon Clark are AudioActive mentors. Olly and Rob have also been homeless. Rob, clad head to toe in sportswear, is buzzing with restless energy. He rocks from one subject to another: his dramatic weight loss; the occasion he was battered by a police officer, leaving him with a classic boxer\u2019s nose; AudioActive\u2019s amazing equipment. Olly is quiet and still.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"84dedb16-06c2-41d2-a5b0-116bf808392e\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/s_pgvN6SCvY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Both boys talk about the horrors of hostel life and a welfare system they feel has let them down. \u201cHostels are shitholes,\u201d Olly says. \u201cI\u2019ve got friends who were really fucked up by them. There are not people looking out for you the way they should be, and there\u2019s drugs everywhere. I\u2019ve had friends kicked out of the same shitty hostels for small reasons without a place to go.\u201d Perhaps the hostels can\u2019t win \u2013 after all, Jake felt hard done by when he was evicted for drinking. The one thing the boys seem uneasy talking about is Jake. After they leave, Hines tells us that Jake\u2019s friends haven\u2019t come to terms with his death, that it is still raw.</p> \n<p>Hines and his fellow mentors talk about Jake with love, admiration and pain. It feels like a group therapy session. Hines says Jake was like an older brother to the ranters: they listened to him, because he had been through it all. \u201cHe was happy to tell young people the dangers of drink and drugs. When I was about to do my job, I\u2019d find he\u2019d jump in and do it for me.\u201d</p> \n<p>All three men agree he was the most talented rapper at AudioActive. \u201cIt was as if everything else in his week was funnelled into those two hours,\u201d Clark says. \u201cHe\u2019d turn up and have three or four new things he\u2019d done. He\u2019d do one and we\u2019d all be gobsmacked, and do the next one and the next one, and it seemed like he was writing every night and this was his forum. This was his place to go and make it happen.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>One of the reasons we couldn\u2019t get funding is we couldn\u2019t measure our impact.

Jake didn\u2019t run away from reality, or soften and sanitise, or big himself up in his lyrics. He rapped about addiction, homelessness, mental health, friendship, love. He was political, but not in an ideological way. \u201cHe would walk down the high street and analyse all the forces at work,\u201d Clark says.</p> \n<p>They knew he was struggling at times \u2013 all the young men at Room to Rant were. There was even one occasion when he stood at the door screaming that he was sick of life and wanted out. But moments later, they say, he was smiling, anticipating a big future for himself. After all, he was Resilient J.</p> \n<p>Yes, he rapped about feeling desperate, Hines says, but rappers tend to rap in character. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to thousands of rappers, and you can\u2019t just take the lyrics at face value. They\u2019re often stories, they\u2019re often metaphorical. People say all sorts of things about death, and sometimes it\u2019s just the best rhyme for that scheme.\u201d Hines says it is the most difficult part of his job \u2013 distinguishing between the rapper in character and the cry for help from the individual.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f0e24a5783161693c4d44c68e71f1bf10cbec762\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0e24a5783161693c4d44c68e71f1bf10cbec762/0_609_3024_3423/883.jpg\" alt=\"Jake Humm (left) pictured with Rag\u2019n\u2019Bone Man in 2018 .\" width=\"883\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jake Humm (left) pictured with Rag\u2019n\u2019Bone Man in 2018 .</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Image supplied by Joules Humm</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Hallwood says that, of all the people who attended Room to Rant, Jake was the one he worried about least, because he was so sure he was destined for success. He talks about the last time he saw him \u2013 at the final Room to Rant session. \u201cI didn\u2019t have Jake as a Facebook friend, but it didn\u2019t matter, because I had in my mind that next time I see Jake he\u2019s gonna be on a viral YouTube video, or on a poster bill next to his favourite rappers.\u201d</p> \n<p>Did anything happen towards the end of his life that may have made him fall off the wagon? The room goes quiet. \u201cThis is really important,\u201d Hines says eventually. \u201cWe ran out of funding. Room to Rant had to close.\u201d The grant, provided by Brighton and Hove clinical commissioning group, was for \u00a35,000 \u2013 enough to run Room to Rant for a year. \u201cOne of the reasons we couldn\u2019t get funding is we couldn\u2019t measure our impact,\u201d Hines says. \u201cUnfortunately, we kind of can now, because another young man quickly ended up in jail and Jake lost a support network. There was a real sense of loss there.\u201d</p> \n<p>How did Jake feel about Room to Rant ending? \u201cHe wasn\u2019t happy about it,\u201d Hines says. \u201cNo one was,\u201d adds Clark. \u201cBrighton can be a very difficult city to make real friends,\u201d Hallwood says. \u201cEspecially for young people. You can find a lot of people who will happily drink with you, happily snort coke with you. You\u2019ll feel like friends because you\u2019re opening up while on drugs, but very few of them will actually put their hand on your shoulder and go: \u2018Are you all right?\u2019\u201d That is why Room to Rant was so special for Jake and the others. \u201cThey were together a couple of years,\u201d Hines says. \u201cThat\u2019s a long time. When a group of young men really open up in front of each other, it makes them very close.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>In her tiny office in a building called Norman Shaw North, near the Houses of Parliament, Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP for Brighton Pavilion, burns with contained rage. She says Brighton and Hove city council has been devastated by the loss of more than \u00a3100m in core government grants since 2010. <a href=\"https://england.shelter.org.uk/professional_resources/policy_and_research/policy_library/policy_library_folder/research_homelessness_in_great_britain_-_the_numbers_behind_the_story\" title=\"\">A report published last November by the housing charity Shelter</a> revealed that Brighton and Hove had the second-highest rate of homelessness in Britain outside London, with 4,317 people registered homeless \u2013 one in 67 of the population. In 2017, Brighton and Hove recorded 178 street homeless people, second only to Westminster among England\u2019s local authorities.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>It was hardly a surprise that taking housing benefit away from under-21s led to more young people being on the streets</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Caroline Lucas, MP</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"47be9e1fa93e201838ef5b92630cf0b2807f7c1d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47be9e1fa93e201838ef5b92630cf0b2807f7c1d/823_0_3438_3436/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Green Party MP Caroline Lucas, who believes that the homelessness crisis is a shocking but inevitable consequence of government policy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion Caroline Lucas.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clodagh Kilcoyne/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Last year, there was a dramatic fall, to 64. But these figures were controversial \u2013 the council admitted it had changed the way it reached its total of street homeless people, and the figures were collated on a snowy November night when many homeless people were thought to have taken refuge indoors. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/deathsofhomelesspeopleinenglandandwales\" title=\"\">data published by the Office </a><a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/deathsofhomelesspeopleinenglandandwales\" title=\"\">for National Statistics</a> showed that, between 2013 and 2017, there were an estimated 48 homeless deaths in Brighton \u2013 among the 10 highest figures for local authorities in England and Wales.</p> \n<p>Lucas believes the homelessness crisis is a shocking but inevitable consequence of government policy. If you refuse to build council homes, sell off the remaining stock and strip young people of housing benefit, she asks, what else can you expect? \u201cIt was hardly a surprise that taking housing benefit away from under-21s led to more young people being on the streets. It\u2019s a callous disregard. The government is content to see that as the collateral damage of its economic ideology.\u201d</p> \n<p>Lucas is alarmed by the rates of homelessness and suicide in Brighton and is urging the council to hold an inquiry. The problem, she says, is that so much of the data is confidential. Without access to data, it is virtually impossible to find exactly where people have been failed. She has also been distressed by her own impotence. In January 2017, the Greens on the council proposed a 24/7, year-round shelter to ensure that nobody had to sleep on the streets: a simple enough plan with obvious benefits. But they were told it wasn\u2019t possible. \u201cWe were told there just wasn\u2019t the money for it,\u201d says Lucas. \u201cWe proposed using council-owned buildings, at least to get a temporary roof over people\u2019s heads. But, actually, the more you learn, the more complex it is in the sense that there isn\u2019t a cost-free option, because people have got to be safe, and to make places safe costs money.\u201d </p> \n<p>At the inquest into Jake\u2019s death in January 2019, the coroner, Veronica Hamilton-Deeley, considered Jake\u2019s relapse. She heard evidence about the suicide of his friend four months before he died and said it would have reminded him of another suicide (that of his step-sister, years earlier) and led to a rapid downward spiral. \u201cThis would have been history repeating itself for him,\u201d said Hamilton-Deeley. \u201cThis instability would have played a huge part. It\u2019s very hard to cope with everything and your own struggles when you\u2019re low.\u201d She concluded that he had killed himself, that it was \u201can impulsive act\u201d and that he \u201cobviously had the support around him\u201d.</p> \n<p>Yet his social media posts suggest his suicide was anything but impulsive. He documented his final three weeks in unsparing detail, telling his friends he was back on the booze and this time determined to drink himself to death. Jake seemed to revel in his relapse. He announced it enthusiastically to his Instagram followers on 9 August 2018, with a picture of bottles of Coke and spirits and a Marilyn Monroe CD resting on top of his coffee table, captioned with the hashtags #relapse and #dontdothingsbyhalves. His inner battles spilled out on to his social media timelines, revealing shifts in mood from hope to despair. Five days into his binge, he posted on Facebook a list of all the drink and drugs he had consumed, while expressing confusion at still being alive with a laughing emoji.</p> \n<p>Over the next couple of days, the breezy take on his self-destruction was replaced with scathing rebukes of psychiatry and therapy, and a desperate lament for the perceived lack of support he had received. Jake ended the post by saying he hoped the alcohol \u201cputs me in my grave in the next few days\u201d. Days later, Jake seemed to have changed his mind again when he posted a picture of the empty bottles resting on his bed and announced he had sobered up. He even recorded himself pouring a bottle of Jack Daniel\u2019s down a toilet. Now it was all about the future. \u201cWatch this space next 2 years are gonna be a madness, focused an driven be ready when I call on u ... I see something new, I see another way out,\u201d he wrote. This renewed optimism was short-lived, however: he relapsed again four days later.</p> \n<p>However anguished they were, these posts often went unliked and uncommented on. He became nostalgic for his childhood. He recalled his days at Saltdean United, including the occasion he almost scored a brilliant overhead kick in a new pair of boots (\u201cBest years of my life so far thank u everyone that was apart of the team and the mums and dads that showed their support even in the pissing down rain\u201d).</p> \n<p>On 26 August, he wrote a bleak and tender poem \u2013 one that echoes so much of what people have told us about him.</p> \n<p>My heart is pure,<br>My mind distorts<br>My souls of course,<br>The systems flawed</p> \n<p>I don\u2019t live like society<br>An abide by the law,</p> \n<p>Never believed in<br>The Lies you bought</p> \n<p>Never agreed with how<br>Schools taught</p> \n<p>I see the world for what it is<br>Now my eyes are so sore</p> \n<p>On 29 August, the day Jake killed himself, he talked with friends on his feed about meeting up for a chat and buying a new Panic! At the Disco album, but his desolation was evident. Then he posted this:</p> \n<p>Laying on my floor<br>With a bottle full of brandy ...<br>I just want to be dead,<br>Coz I\u2019ve got nothing left<br>Nothing to hold on to<br>Everything\u2019s been said<br>I\u2019ve got a girl in my bed<br>But I don\u2019t even care<br>But I do I\u2019m just scared.</p> \n<p>By now, he seemed exhausted, terrified and desperately lonely. \u201cAll I want is real love.<strong> </strong>In these days it seems impossible,\u201d he wrote. He asked his father for money in a Facebook post, told him how much he adored him, then hanged himself. Joules was away that day and didn\u2019t see the post.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>When the police came to inform Joules of his son\u2019s death, he says he told them why they were there. \u201cFor a long time, deep down, it was my deepest, darkest fear. That\u2019s why I knew when they came to the door.\u201d Since that day, Joules has constantly interrogated himself about his role in his son\u2019s suicide. \u201cThe hardest thing for me, even now, is to not beat myself up about it,\u201d Joules says, his voice breaking. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to,\u201d Hunter says gently. \u201cI like to think, deep down, that I did everything possible,\u201d Joules says. \u201cHe did,\u201d Hunter says to us. \u201cBut that does not stop me from kicking myself every day,\u201d Joules adds.</p> \n<p>Jake\u2019s body was discovered after other residents in the YMCA-run house in which he was living complained of smelly drains. \u201cIf you remember last year, we had a heatwave,\u201d Joules says. \u201cAnd I think the rest is pretty self-explanatory.\u201d</p> \n<p>It was Hunter who discovered Jake, after he had been dead for two days. \u201cAnd there\u2019s my guilt,\u201d she says. She is in tears; it is Joules\u2019s turn to comfort her.</p> \n<p>The room in which Jake died is a little more than 200 metres from where we are seated with Joules and Hunter at the bandstand on the beach. We walk up to Bedford Square. It is the first time Joules has visited the building \u2013 a Regency townhouse \u2013 since Jake died there. Hunter points to the top floor, where Jake\u2019s room was. Joules looks up and breaks down. He walks away, weeping.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6ad55ae2-5e7f-41bb-92db-8c5dc5284b92\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3MWNKftA4yk?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>So many of Jake\u2019s social posts in his final three weeks read like cries for help that went unheard. Yet throughout this time, he was living in semi-independent YMCA accommodation and was seen by Pavilions, the Brighton-based treatment centre for drug and alcohol abuse. Jake\u2019s care co-ordinator at Pavilions, Paula Hinks, told the inquest that, during an appointment in August last year, he had said he was enjoying drinking and had no intention of giving up.</p> \n<p>We ask Pavilions if it was also aware of his suicidal thoughts, whether it shared information about his relapse with support staff at the YMCA and whether it considered sectioning Jake under the Mental Health Act. Pavilions tells us it does not share any information regarding the treatment and care of its service users because it is confidential.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--thumbnail\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=%C2%A3100m&amp;title=amount%20Brighton%20and%20Hove%20has%20lost%20in%20core%20government%20grants%20since%202010\" data-alt=\"\u00a3100m amount Brighton and Hove has lost in core government grants since 2010\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=%C2%A3100m&amp;title=amount%20Brighton%20and%20Hove%20has%20lost%20in%20core%20government%20grants%20since%202010\">\u00a3100m amount Brighton and Hove has lost in core government grants since 2010</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Hunter\u2019s concern and affection for Jake could not be more apparent. Yet there is still a question mark about whether the YMCA did all it could do to protect him from himself when he was at his most vulnerable. Was Bedford Square sufficiently staffed to monitor Jake\u2019s fatal three-week binge?</p> \n<p>Shortly after meeting Joules and Hunter, we receive an email from the YMCA DownsLink Group saying it would like to help in any way possible. We ask how many staff work at Bedford Square and whether they are residential. But the return email is surprisingly unhelpful. \u201cMy understanding is that the article is about Jake\u2019s story and we want to keep it focused on him, therefore we don\u2019t think the questions regarding our staffing and services etc are necessary,\u201d says a manager at the YMCA DownsLink Group.</p> \n<p>We ask the YMCA whether it knew that Jake was drinking and suicidal. \u201cWe were aware that Jake had started using alcohol again in the weeks before his death,\u201d the YMCA tells us. \u201cStaff were supporting him to access specialist mental health and substance misuse services. Jake also expressed suicidal thoughts and we therefore agreed a \u2018safe plan\u2019 with him on 17 August.\u201d When we ask what Jake\u2019s safe plan involved, the YMCA does not respond. It does, though, quote the coroner\u2019s findings that Jake \u201cobviously had the support around him\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>When Jake committed to things, he gave 150%, including his death. He meant what he did, as hard as that is to say</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Joules Humm</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The YMCA describes itself as \u201cthe largest provider of safe, supported accommodation for young people in England and Wales\u201d, offering more than 9,100 beds, \u201cwhich includes everything from emergency accommodation through to supported longer-term housing and youth hostels\u201d. Although the YMCA is regulated by the Charity Commission and the Regulator of Social Housing, much of the support offered in its accommodation is unregulated. The semi-independent home in Bedford Square, where Jake died, is self-regulating because it provides support rather than \u201cpersonal care\u201d. This means that its support is neither monitored by the Care Quality Commission nor Ofsted, despite the fact that residents may be as young as 16.</p> \n<p>We ask Brighton and Hove city council if it is considering an inquiry into Jake\u2019s death. The council quotes the coroner\u2019s verdict, saying: \u201cWe do not see any basis for conducting a further inquiry into these circumstances. We had no involvement in the care he received from the YMCA DownsLink Group in the period leading up to his death, and have no comment to make on it.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/sep/17/homeless-deaths-share-your-tributes\">Homeless deaths: share your tributes</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>However, the YMCA tells us it conducted an internal review after Jake\u2019s death. We ask if the review considered whether the YMCA should have had Jake sectioned or moved into supported accommodation, whether they had seen Jake enough in the weeks leading up to his death and whether it was satisfactory that he had been left for at least two days despite being a known suicide risk. The YMCA did not answer these questions, but it did say: \u201cOur review concluded that there were no errors or omissions in the service we provided, despite the sad outcome. However, we did identify some changes we could make, such as, for example, introducing a ligature risk assessment whereby potential ligature points could be identified and promptly removed if a resident was deemed to be at risk of suicide or self-harm.\u201d</p> \n<p>For Caroline Lucas, self-regulation is simply not good enough. \u201cWhenever you\u2019ve got institutions that are unregulated, then you\u2019re putting people at risk, because mistakes happen. Interventions should have happened and they didn\u2019t, and risk factors should have been recognised and they weren\u2019t.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>It has been just over a year since Jake\u2019s death. At AudioActive, they are continuing to feel the fallout. The project manager, Tom Hines, says his job has changed \u2013 much of it now is about safeguarding. He worries that he is nannying too many of the youngsters he works with. \u201cIt\u2019s made my life a bit harder \u2013 I probably bother kids more than I should do.\u201d One piece of good news is that they have managed to find the funds to relaunch Room to Rant, partly through donations made at Jake\u2019s funeral, including \u00a3500 from Rag\u2019n\u2019Bone Man.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"49fae08d3206e1b343cdd94ebebc4801d5aef317\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49fae08d3206e1b343cdd94ebebc4801d5aef317/0_0_902_950/475.jpg\" alt=\"Jake with a catch from one of the fishing trips he and Joules enjoyed together.\" width=\"475\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jake with a catch from one of the fishing trips he and Joules enjoyed together.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Provided by the Humm Family</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>As for Joules, he seems to be in a more profound state of shock than he was when we first met him three months ago. Recently, he had to talk one of Jake\u2019s friends out of killing himself. Over the past week, he says two more young people have died through suicide in Brighton. Both of them knew Jake. He still believes that, ultimately, his son was determined to kill himself. \u201cWhen Jake committed to things, he gave 150%, including his death. He meant what he did, as hard as that is to say.\u201d</p> \n<p>He says he misses his son so much, and a day doesn\u2019t pass without a what-if. Often, when he is out fishing on the lake by himself, he will tear into Jake for his stupidity, for leaving him in the lurch. \u201cI swear at him a lot,\u201d Joules says. \u201cI\u2019m not angry with him. I\u2019ll be sitting there thinking about things we did, and it just hits you, and I\u2019ll be like: \u2018Yeah, you little bastard, we won\u2019t be doing that again, will we?\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Nowadays, he says, it feels as if he has got an extended family \u2013 father to none and father to all. So many of Jake\u2019s friends turn to him for advice, but he is in no state to carry their load. He has got enough baggage of his own. \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m struggling,\u201d he says.</p> \n<p><em>In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or by emailing <a href=\"mailto://jo@samaritans.org\" title=\"\">jo@samaritans.org</a> or <a href=\"mailto://jo@samaritans.ie\" title=\"\">jo@samaritans.ie</a>.

      "bodyText": "Joules Humm has dedicated his left arm to his son, Jake. Every tattoo is a reference to him: his favourite numbers (one and three); his date of birth (13 October 1995); an image of the grim reaper alongside the words \u201cLive now pay later\u201d; a dragon koi, because Jake loved fishing; the musical notation for the chorus of his song Try Me. Then, tattooed along his forearm in script, is \u201cResilient J\u201d, Jake\u2019s rapper name. Jake had so much potential and was beginning to turn his life around. He had been sober for almost two years after drinking excessively since he was 16. After years in flux \u2013 pinballing from supported accommodation in Brighton to homeless hostels, squats and friends\u2019 sofas \u2013 he seemed to be on the verge of getting his own place. He was even beginning to make inroads into the music industry: in January 2018, he joined in a filmed session with the hugely successful singer-songwriter Rag\u2019n\u2019Bone Man. But in the end, Resilient J wasn\u2019t quite resilient enough. After losing a close friend to suicide and witnessing another overdosing, he relapsed. A three-week drinking binge followed, before he killed himself on 29 August 2018. Jake was 22. Suicide is the second-biggest killer of homeless people in the UK, and Brighton has one of the highest suicide rates in the country. The city is a transient place: great for holidaymakers and day trippers, but tough for many people growing up there. Austerity has rattled Brighton, producing a lack of secure employment and affordable housing, which has led to some of the highest rates of rough sleeping and homelessness outside London. Cuts have decimated social care and education, contributing to a mounting youth crisis and communities where one in three children are living in poverty. At the same time, the influx of wealthier people (often second-home owners) to the city has increased house prices. Jake didn\u2019t leave a suicide note. It is impossible to know exactly what was going through his mind at the end. But the more you look into this life, the more you see all these elements coming into play \u2013 transience, loneliness, cuts to social care and support groups, unregulated services and, ultimately, institutional failings. We meet Jake\u2019s father in a cafe on Brighton\u2019s seafront, underneath the bandstand where Jake loved to hang out with friends. Joules is accompanied by Michelle Hunter, a project team leader at the YMCA DownsLink Group, which was supporting Jake at the time of his death. It is nine months since he died, and Joules is still staggering towards an understanding and acceptance of what happened. Jake was his only child, his fishing partner, his soulmate. And yet, as is so often the case, there were tensions; they bickered and, ultimately, couldn\u2019t live with each other. Hunter had known Jake for years. She says he adored his father, and tells us how she and Joules would work together, behind his back, to try to keep Jake\u2019s life on track. She talks about Jake with huge affection and emotion. She is also, perhaps unsurprisingly, a little defensive. Joules, a 48-year-old carpenter, says it is uncanny how much he and Jake had in common \u2013 the same hobbies, obsessions and weaknesses. It was Joules who introduced Jake to music (all sorts, from Led Zeppelin to Eminem), taught him how to fish and encouraged his tidiness, which later became a fixation. But there was more. Joules knew exactly how tough it could be for young people, men in particular, trying to make their way in Brighton. He had moved there from London as a young man. Like Jake, he was creative, funny and handsome. Like Jake, he had struggled to make ends meet, battled depression and alcoholism (he last drank eight years ago) and spent time sofa surfing and in temporary accommodation. There is little that Jake went through that his father didn\u2019t understand. Joules says there were times when he, too, was suicidal. Joules says he and his son always had a special bond. Jake\u2019s parents split up when he was about four; Joules says he was denied custody because he was living in temporary accommodation. Four years later, when Joules was settled, Jake moved into a flat with him. In some ways, Jake was a natural leader. At the age of seven, he was a star of the local football team, Saltdean United. Joules says he showed a rare maturity. \u201cIf someone was not pulling their weight in a certain position, rather than stand up front for the glory, Jake would drop into that position.\u201d But in other ways, he struggled. School didn\u2019t know what to do with Jake. He was bright, good with words, but he couldn\u2019t settle. He played truant, and was disruptive when he did turn up. At the age of 14, he was being seen by the child and adolescent mental health services. Eventually, he was diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder. He wasn\u2019t violent or aggressive, but he was pig-headed. He would find daft, random ways of getting into trouble at school. Joules tells the story of the marrow. \u201cHe went into a biology classroom and he picked up a marrow that the year below were growing, and one of the kids said: \u2018You can have it, Jake.\u2019\u201d When the teachers asked him to return it, he refused, telling them it was a gift. He was deliberately winding them up. But the game got out of hand. By the end of the day, it had become a perverse matter of principle. \u201cJake climbed up on the school roof and launched it across the playground so nobody could have it,\u201d says Joules. \u201cThat\u2019s when he got into trouble, because it could have hit somebody.\u201d It is such a mild act of rebellion, yet somehow it sums up Jake\u2019s brooding sense of injustice, that all was not well with the world. On social media he would vent his anger at all that was wrong with society. He became a conspiracy theorist, convinced that the US government was behind the bombing of the twin towers. He was 16, still at school and already drinking too much when he decided to leave home. Joules agreed it was the best thing. There were no dramas, he says; they just needed their own space. \u201cThe relationship didn\u2019t break down, but both of us could see where it was going. Maybe it was an alpha-male thing. It wasn\u2019t a case of me saying: \u2018Jake, you\u2019ve gotta go.\u2019 It was kind of a mutual thing. It was quite calm; it wasn\u2019t ugly.\u201d Jake moved into accommodation at the YMCA in Brighton, a supported hostel with space for up to 15 residents. Hunter remembers that the first time she saw him he was wearing his school uniform. He was drinking more and more heavily, and started as he meant to go on \u2013 with spirits. We ask Joules where he got the money. Joules smiles and says he doesn\u2019t think the local Co-op would have been best pleased with his son. When Jake wasn\u2019t drinking, he would become agitated. At times, he would self-harm. Alcohol is strictly prohibited at the YMCA. Jake lasted almost a year with the charity before being evicted after a \u201cnumber of incidents involving anti-social behaviour\u201d. Hunter says there was no choice \u2013 he was breaking the rules and making it tough for others. She insists the YMCA continued to support him. \u201cTo us, he was one of our young people,\u201d she says. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve come to us and we\u2019re there, the door is always open.\u201d The door may have been open, but Jake was no longer allowed to sleep at the YMCA. After the YMCA, Jake\u2019s living situation fell into chaos. He bounced around every kind of housing project throughout Brighton, Newhaven and further afield. He and Joules remained close, but they knew it wouldn\u2019t work if he moved back in. Jake had admitted that there were numerous occasions when he was offered help and refused it. In October 2016, as he turned 21, he decided to take himself in hand and checked into a 10-day detox programme in London. At the end of that month, Jake announced to his Facebook friends: \u201cA new chapter in my life is on the horizon, a life without drink an drugs, no doubt my demons will wanna war but [it\u2019s] a war I\u2019m gonna win!!! bring on tomorrow!\u201d For a long time, it looked as if he was winning it. After kicking the booze, he got back into shape, took on voluntary work and strengthened his relationship with his father. Jake and Joules spent weeks together camped out on lakes, catching and posing with carp the size of pitbulls. For the first time in five years, Jake moved back in with the YMCA \u2013 this time into semi-independent accommodation, which he hoped would be a stepping stone towards independence. He also embarked on a period of ferocious creativity. * * * The music organisation AudioActive is based in an old warehouse in Brighton. It looks like any old ramshackle building, until you enter and discover a rabbit warren of recording studios. AudioActive helps young people express themselves through music, and this is where Jake created some of his best work. For almost two years after Jake became clean, he attended a weekly session called Room to Rant, which provided just that. He was one of half a dozen struggling young men who turned up to express their anger, frustration and talent through music. Jake was older than most of his fellow ranters, but younger than the youth workers who supported them. He ended up close to both groups. In the video with Rag\u2019n\u2019Bone Man, Jake explained what Room to Rant had done for him. \u201cThere\u2019s not enough places for young men to be able to express themselves and express their feelings. Whatever it is on your mind, you can come here and you\u2019re not going to be judged for it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to have someone looking down their nose, like: \u2018Oh, you\u2019re weak, or you\u2019re vulnerable,\u2019 because we\u2019re not. We just have trouble sometimes with life.\u201d Tom Hines, AudioActive\u2019s project manager, leads us to a studio where we meet four of Jake\u2019s friends. Olly and Rob are regular ranters, while Ed Hallwood and Jon Clark are AudioActive mentors. Olly and Rob have also been homeless. Rob, clad head to toe in sportswear, is buzzing with restless energy. He rocks from one subject to another: his dramatic weight loss; the occasion he was battered by a police officer, leaving him with a classic boxer\u2019s nose; AudioActive\u2019s amazing equipment. Olly is quiet and still. Both boys talk about the horrors of hostel life and a welfare system they feel has let them down. \u201cHostels are shitholes,\u201d Olly says. \u201cI\u2019ve got friends who were really fucked up by them. There are not people looking out for you the way they should be, and there\u2019s drugs everywhere. I\u2019ve had friends kicked out of the same shitty hostels for small reasons without a place to go.\u201d Perhaps the hostels can\u2019t win \u2013 after all, Jake felt hard done by when he was evicted for drinking. The one thing the boys seem uneasy talking about is Jake. After they leave, Hines tells us that Jake\u2019s friends haven\u2019t come to terms with his death, that it is still raw. Hines and his fellow mentors talk about Jake with love, admiration and pain. It feels like a group therapy session. Hines says Jake was like an older brother to the ranters: they listened to him, because he had been through it all. \u201cHe was happy to tell young people the dangers of drink and drugs. When I was about to do my job, I\u2019d find he\u2019d jump in and do it for me.\u201d All three men agree he was the most talented rapper at AudioActive. \u201cIt was as if everything else in his week was funnelled into those two hours,\u201d Clark says. \u201cHe\u2019d turn up and have three or four new things he\u2019d done. He\u2019d do one and we\u2019d all be gobsmacked, and do the next one and the next one, and it seemed like he was writing every night and this was his forum. This was his place to go and make it happen.\u201d The word they use again and again is \u201cfierce\u201d \u2013 not about Jake, but about his music. Jake didn\u2019t run away from reality, or soften and sanitise, or big himself up in his lyrics. He rapped about addiction, homelessness, mental health, friendship, love. He was political, but not in an ideological way. \u201cHe would walk down the high street and analyse all the forces at work,\u201d Clark says. They knew he was struggling at times \u2013 all the young men at Room to Rant were. There was even one occasion when he stood at the door screaming that he was sick of life and wanted out. But moments later, they say, he was smiling, anticipating a big future for himself. After all, he was Resilient J. Yes, he rapped about feeling desperate, Hines says, but rappers tend to rap in character. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to thousands of rappers, and you can\u2019t just take the lyrics at face value. They\u2019re often stories, they\u2019re often metaphorical. People say all sorts of things about death, and sometimes it\u2019s just the best rhyme for that scheme.\u201d Hines says it is the most difficult part of his job \u2013 distinguishing between the rapper in character and the cry for help from the individual. Hallwood says that, of all the people who attended Room to Rant, Jake was the one he worried about least, because he was so sure he was destined for success. He talks about the last time he saw him \u2013 at the final Room to Rant session. \u201cI didn\u2019t have Jake as a Facebook friend, but it didn\u2019t matter, because I had in my mind that next time I see Jake he\u2019s gonna be on a viral YouTube video, or on a poster bill next to his favourite rappers.\u201d Did anything happen towards the end of his life that may have made him fall off the wagon? The room goes quiet. \u201cThis is really important,\u201d Hines says eventually. \u201cWe ran out of funding. Room to Rant had to close.\u201d The grant, provided by Brighton and Hove clinical commissioning group, was for \u00a35,000 \u2013 enough to run Room to Rant for a year. \u201cOne of the reasons we couldn\u2019t get funding is we couldn\u2019t measure our impact,\u201d Hines says. \u201cUnfortunately, we kind of can now, because another young man quickly ended up in jail and Jake lost a support network. There was a real sense of loss there.\u201d How did Jake feel about Room to Rant ending? \u201cHe wasn\u2019t happy about it,\u201d Hines says. \u201cNo one was,\u201d adds Clark. \u201cBrighton can be a very difficult city to make real friends,\u201d Hallwood says. \u201cEspecially for young people. You can find a lot of people who will happily drink with you, happily snort coke with you. You\u2019ll feel like friends because you\u2019re opening up while on drugs, but very few of them will actually put their hand on your shoulder and go: \u2018Are you all right?\u2019\u201d That is why Room to Rant was so special for Jake and the others. \u201cThey were together a couple of years,\u201d Hines says. \u201cThat\u2019s a long time. When a group of young men really open up in front of each other, it makes them very close.\u201d * * * In her tiny office in a building called Norman Shaw North, near the Houses of Parliament, Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP for Brighton Pavilion, burns with contained rage. She says Brighton and Hove city council has been devastated by the loss of more than \u00a3100m in core government grants since 2010. A report published last November by the housing charity Shelter revealed that Brighton and Hove had the second-highest rate of homelessness in Britain outside London, with 4,317 people registered homeless \u2013 one in 67 of the population. In 2017, Brighton and Hove recorded 178 street homeless people, second only to Westminster among England\u2019s local authorities. Last year, there was a dramatic fall, to 64. But these figures were controversial \u2013 the council admitted it had changed the way it reached its total of street homeless people, and the figures were collated on a snowy November night when many homeless people were thought to have taken refuge indoors. Meanwhile, data published by the Office for National Statistics showed that, between 2013 and 2017, there were an estimated 48 homeless deaths in Brighton \u2013 among the 10 highest figures for local authorities in England and Wales. Lucas believes the homelessness crisis is a shocking but inevitable consequence of government policy. If you refuse to build council homes, sell off the remaining stock and strip young people of housing benefit, she asks, what else can you expect? \u201cIt was hardly a surprise that taking housing benefit away from under-21s led to more young people being on the streets. It\u2019s a callous disregard. The government is content to see that as the collateral damage of its economic ideology.\u201d Lucas is alarmed by the rates of homelessness and suicide in Brighton and is urging the council to hold an inquiry. The problem, she says, is that so much of the data is confidential. Without access to data, it is virtually impossible to find exactly where people have been failed. She has also been distressed by her own impotence. In January 2017, the Greens on the council proposed a 24/7, year-round shelter to ensure that nobody had to sleep on the streets: a simple enough plan with obvious benefits. But they were told it wasn\u2019t possible. \u201cWe were told there just wasn\u2019t the money for it,\u201d says Lucas. \u201cWe proposed using council-owned buildings, at least to get a temporary roof over people\u2019s heads. But, actually, the more you learn, the more complex it is in the sense that there isn\u2019t a cost-free option, because people have got to be safe, and to make places safe costs money.\u201d At the inquest into Jake\u2019s death in January 2019, the coroner, Veronica Hamilton-Deeley, considered Jake\u2019s relapse. She heard evidence about the suicide of his friend four months before he died and said it would have reminded him of another suicide (that of his step-sister, years earlier) and led to a rapid downward spiral. \u201cThis would have been history repeating itself for him,\u201d said Hamilton-Deeley. \u201cThis instability would have played a huge part. It\u2019s very hard to cope with everything and your own struggles when you\u2019re low.\u201d She concluded that he had killed himself, that it was \u201can impulsive act\u201d and that he \u201cobviously had the support around him\u201d. Yet his social media posts suggest his suicide was anything but impulsive. He documented his final three weeks in unsparing detail, telling his friends he was back on the booze and this time determined to drink himself to death. Jake seemed to revel in his relapse. He announced it enthusiastically to his Instagram followers on 9 August 2018, with a picture of bottles of Coke and spirits and a Marilyn Monroe CD resting on top of his coffee table, captioned with the hashtags #relapse and #dontdothingsbyhalves. His inner battles spilled out on to his social media timelines, revealing shifts in mood from hope to despair. Five days into his binge, he posted on Facebook a list of all the drink and drugs he had consumed, while expressing confusion at still being alive with a laughing emoji. Over the next couple of days, the breezy take on his self-destruction was replaced with scathing rebukes of psychiatry and therapy, and a desperate lament for the perceived lack of support he had received. Jake ended the post by saying he hoped the alcohol \u201cputs me in my grave in the next few days\u201d. Days later, Jake seemed to have changed his mind again when he posted a picture of the empty bottles resting on his bed and announced he had sobered up. He even recorded himself pouring a bottle of Jack Daniel\u2019s down a toilet. Now it was all about the future. \u201cWatch this space next 2 years are gonna be a madness, focused an driven be ready when I call on u ... I see something new, I see another way out,\u201d he wrote. This renewed optimism was short-lived, however: he relapsed again four days later. However anguished they were, these posts often went unliked and uncommented on. He became nostalgic for his childhood. He recalled his days at Saltdean United, including the occasion he almost scored a brilliant overhead kick in a new pair of boots (\u201cBest years of my life so far thank u everyone that was apart of the team and the mums and dads that showed their support even in the pissing down rain\u201d). On 26 August, he wrote a bleak and tender poem \u2013 one that echoes so much of what people have told us about him. My heart is pure, My mind distorts My souls of course, The systems flawed I don\u2019t live like society An abide by the law, Never believed in The Lies you bought Never agreed with how Schools taught I see the world for what it is Now my eyes are so sore On 29 August, the day Jake killed himself, he talked with friends on his feed about meeting up for a chat and buying a new Panic! At the Disco album, but his desolation was evident. Then he posted this: Laying on my floor With a bottle full of brandy ... I just want to be dead, Coz I\u2019ve got nothing left Nothing to hold on to Everything\u2019s been said I\u2019ve got a girl in my bed But I don\u2019t even care But I do I\u2019m just scared. By now, he seemed exhausted, terrified and desperately lonely. \u201cAll I want is real love. In these days it seems impossible,\u201d he wrote. He asked his father for money in a Facebook post, told him how much he adored him, then hanged himself. Joules was away that day and didn\u2019t see the post. * * * When the police came to inform Joules of his son\u2019s death, he says he told them why they were there. \u201cFor a long time, deep down, it was my deepest, darkest fear. That\u2019s why I knew when they came to the door.\u201d Since that day, Joules has constantly interrogated himself about his role in his son\u2019s suicide. \u201cThe hardest thing for me, even now, is to not beat myself up about it,\u201d Joules says, his voice breaking. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to,\u201d Hunter says gently. \u201cI like to think, deep down, that I did everything possible,\u201d Joules says. \u201cHe did,\u201d Hunter says to us. \u201cBut that does not stop me from kicking myself every day,\u201d Joules adds. Jake\u2019s body was discovered after other residents in the YMCA-run house in which he was living complained of smelly drains. \u201cIf you remember last year, we had a heatwave,\u201d Joules says. \u201cAnd I think the rest is pretty self-explanatory.\u201d It was Hunter who discovered Jake, after he had been dead for two days. \u201cAnd there\u2019s my guilt,\u201d she says. She is in tears; it is Joules\u2019s turn to comfort her. The room in which Jake died is a little more than 200 metres from where we are seated with Joules and Hunter at the bandstand on the beach. We walk up to Bedford Square. It is the first time Joules has visited the building \u2013 a Regency townhouse \u2013 since Jake died there. Hunter points to the top floor, where Jake\u2019s room was. Joules looks up and breaks down. He walks away, weeping. So many of Jake\u2019s social posts in his final three weeks read like cries for help that went unheard. Yet throughout this time, he was living in semi-independent YMCA accommodation and was seen by Pavilions, the Brighton-based treatment centre for drug and alcohol abuse. Jake\u2019s care co-ordinator at Pavilions, Paula Hinks, told the inquest that, during an appointment in August last year, he had said he was enjoying drinking and had no intention of giving up. We ask Pavilions if it was also aware of his suicidal thoughts, whether it shared information about his relapse with support staff at the YMCA and whether it considered sectioning Jake under the Mental Health Act. Pavilions tells us it does not share any information regarding the treatment and care of its service users because it is confidential. Hunter\u2019s concern and affection for Jake could not be more apparent. Yet there is still a question mark about whether the YMCA did all it could do to protect him from himself when he was at his most vulnerable. Was Bedford Square sufficiently staffed to monitor Jake\u2019s fatal three-week binge? Shortly after meeting Joules and Hunter, we receive an email from the YMCA DownsLink Group saying it would like to help in any way possible. We ask how many staff work at Bedford Square and whether they are residential. But the return email is surprisingly unhelpful. \u201cMy understanding is that the article is about Jake\u2019s story and we want to keep it focused on him, therefore we don\u2019t think the questions regarding our staffing and services etc are necessary,\u201d says a manager at the YMCA DownsLink Group. We ask the YMCA whether it knew that Jake was drinking and suicidal. \u201cWe were aware that Jake had started using alcohol again in the weeks before his death,\u201d the YMCA tells us. \u201cStaff were supporting him to access specialist mental health and substance misuse services. Jake also expressed suicidal thoughts and we therefore agreed a \u2018safe plan\u2019 with him on 17 August.\u201d When we ask what Jake\u2019s safe plan involved, the YMCA does not respond. It does, though, quote the coroner\u2019s findings that Jake \u201cobviously had the support around him\u201d. The YMCA describes itself as \u201cthe largest provider of safe, supported accommodation for young people in England and Wales\u201d, offering more than 9,100 beds, \u201cwhich includes everything from emergency accommodation through to supported longer-term housing and youth hostels\u201d. Although the YMCA is regulated by the Charity Commission and the Regulator of Social Housing, much of the support offered in its accommodation is unregulated. The semi-independent home in Bedford Square, where Jake died, is self-regulating because it provides support rather than \u201cpersonal care\u201d. This means that its support is neither monitored by the Care Quality Commission nor Ofsted, despite the fact that residents may be as young as 16. We ask Brighton and Hove city council if it is considering an inquiry into Jake\u2019s death. The council quotes the coroner\u2019s verdict, saying: \u201cWe do not see any basis for conducting a further inquiry into these circumstances. We had no involvement in the care he received from the YMCA DownsLink Group in the period leading up to his death, and have no comment to make on it.\u201d However, the YMCA tells us it conducted an internal review after Jake\u2019s death. We ask if the review considered whether the YMCA should have had Jake sectioned or moved into supported accommodation, whether they had seen Jake enough in the weeks leading up to his death and whether it was satisfactory that he had been left for at least two days despite being a known suicide risk. The YMCA did not answer these questions, but it did say: \u201cOur review concluded that there were no errors or omissions in the service we provided, despite the sad outcome. However, we did identify some changes we could make, such as, for example, introducing a ligature risk assessment whereby potential ligature points could be identified and promptly removed if a resident was deemed to be at risk of suicide or self-harm.\u201d For Caroline Lucas, self-regulation is simply not good enough. \u201cWhenever you\u2019ve got institutions that are unregulated, then you\u2019re putting people at risk, because mistakes happen. Interventions should have happened and they didn\u2019t, and risk factors should have been recognised and they weren\u2019t.\u201d * * * It has been just over a year since Jake\u2019s death. At AudioActive, they are continuing to feel the fallout. The project manager, Tom Hines, says his job has changed \u2013 much of it now is about safeguarding. He worries that he is nannying too many of the youngsters he works with. \u201cIt\u2019s made my life a bit harder \u2013 I probably bother kids more than I should do.\u201d One piece of good news is that they have managed to find the funds to relaunch Room to Rant, partly through donations made at Jake\u2019s funeral, including \u00a3500 from Rag\u2019n\u2019Bone Man. As for Joules, he seems to be in a more profound state of shock than he was when we first met him three months ago. Recently, he had to talk one of Jake\u2019s friends out of killing himself. Over the past week, he says two more young people have died through suicide in Brighton. Both of them knew Jake. He still believes that, ultimately, his son was determined to kill himself. \u201cWhen Jake committed to things, he gave 150%, including his death. He meant what he did, as hard as that is to say.\u201d He says he misses his son so much, and a day doesn\u2019t pass without a what-if. Often, when he is out fishing on the lake by himself, he will tear into Jake for his stupidity, for leaving him in the lurch. \u201cI swear at him a lot,\u201d Joules says. \u201cI\u2019m not angry with him. I\u2019ll be sitting there thinking about things we did, and it just hits you, and I\u2019ll be like: \u2018Yeah, you little bastard, we won\u2019t be doing that again, will we?\u2019\u201d Nowadays, he says, it feels as if he has got an extended family \u2013 father to none and father to all. So many of Jake\u2019s friends turn to him for advice, but he is in no state to carry their load. He has got enough baggage of his own. \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m struggling,\u201d he says.

Northern Ireland and Ireland\u2019s human rights commissioners are calling for a bill of rights or a guarantee that the EU charter of fundamental rights will remain in effect in Northern Ireland.

Where else within the UK would have that written down, a basic right to chose where you live.\u201d She added: \u201cThis is the reality, this is where Northern Ireland came from,\u201d she added, pointing to page 20 of the Good Friday agreement which lists the human rights that need to be protected. Other areas of the Northern Ireland protocol include a pledge to keep pace and preserve EU law providing equality employment rights, self-employment rights, social services, and non-discrimination on race and ethnic origin. The two human rights commissions were set up as a result of the Good Friday agreement to protect and enforce rights on both sides of the border. But their respective chiefs lament the disproportionate attention given to trade, customs and tariffs. \u201cWe\u2019ve been at the forefront of what\u2019s been an invisible debate,\u201d said Logan. They said too few politicians recognised that the region was already different to the rest of the UK because of the troubles. \u201cHuman rights was such a contested area in Northern Ireland,\u201d said Allamby. \u201cHuman rights issues have not moved forward in the same pace as the rest of the UK \u2013 abortion and gay rights being two good examples. A bill of rights is a human rights backstop, an insurance policy.\u201d They said one option is for the EU charter of fundamental rights to be preserved for Northern Ireland until an alternative is found. Allamby is also concerned that a no-deal Brexit will create a two-tier society in Northern Ireland, with Irish passport holders continuing to hold freedom of movement rights and potentially access to education and Erasmus programmes in all EU member states. He said that will breach the Good Friday agreement, where equality of those who identify as Irish and/or British is enshrined. At the core of their argument is a concern that the social cohesion in cross-border communities will be washed away by Brexit. Pensioner clubs or church activities \u201con one side of the border or other\u201d have flourished since 1998 helping to heal old wounds, said Allamby. \u201cThe fear is genuine for a generation who remember the troubles.\u201d",

More large-scale protests followed, including the standoff over the Dakota Access pipeline, which temporarily delayed the project.</p> <p>But those decisions have been reversed in recent years.

Activists who engage in non-violent civil disobedience and are charged with minor offenses such as trespassing are typically released within 48 hours.</p> <p>The FBI characterized Yost as being driven by a \u201cdesire to stop fossil fuels which, in her political view, are destroying parts of the US, specifically Montana, Idaho and Washington\u201d.

Several months later the investigation was closed.</p> <p>However, in the file closing the case, it appears that Yost has been watchlisted, which is standard for named subjects of FBI domestic terrorism investigations, according to Mike German, a former FBI agent who is now a fellow with the Brennan Center for Justice. Being watchlisted can lead to heightened scrutiny from law enforcement and delays or additional screenings when traveling. Yost said she had not traveled overseas since the FBI investigation.</p> <p>Yost, who was contacted by an FBI agent when the case was still active, said she was not surprised by the agency\u2019s actions. Surveillance was a form of suppression, she said, and this was another attempt to criminalize the actions of \u201cnormal people\u201d working to protect natural resources.

He was also part of the Occupy Wall Street protests in Bellingham, Washington, in 2011 and was one of 12 individuals arrested that year for blockading a BNSF coal train passing through the city. They became known as the Bellingham 12.</p> <p>Goodwin was one of at least a dozen environmental activists, many of them affiliated with the group Deep Green Resistance, contacted by FBI agents in autumn 2014. In early October that year, not long after Goodwin returned from a megaload resistance campaign in Idaho, an FBI agent and a police intelligence officer showed up at his residence.<strong> </strong>According to Goodwin, they wanted to ask him questions about the environmental group Deep Green Resistance. Goodwin refused to cooperate and referred the agents to his lawyer, who himself <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/06/environmental-group-lawyer-interrogated\">became a subject of interest</a> to the FBI.</p> <p>Founded in 2011 Deep Green Resistance (DGR), based on the principles laid out in the book of the same name, describes itself as a radical organization that \u201cuses direct action in the fight to save the planet\u201d. Though the group supports underground movements, its members abide by a code of conduct that includes a commitment to nonviolence and operating entirely above-ground. According to the group\u2019s website, \u201cWe do not want to be involved in or aware of any underground organizing.\u201d In another FBI interview with a DGR member documented in the files, the activist even invited the agents to attend one of DGR\u2019s presentations.</p> <p>FBI files show that the bureau initiated the two-year investigation into DGR to determine if the group or any of its members were planning to engage in the destruction of energy facilities or attacks against railroad companies, referring to the same federal statute cited in the Yost investigation.</p> <p>But the FBI also took an interest in constitutionally protected activities, including DGR members\u2019 participation in public meetings and lectures and the group\u2019s early organizing efforts.</p> <p>Even though the FBI investigation found no evidence that DGR was planning to engage in violent activity, it often portrayed the group as an extremist organization.

The investigations, which targeted individual activists and some environmental organizations, were opened in 2013-2014, at the height of opposition to the Keystone XL Pipeline and the expansion of fossil fuel production in North America. The new Foia documents reveal the bureau\u2019s motivation for investigating a broad cross-section of the environmental movement and its characterization of non-violent protesters as a potential threat to national security. In 2010, the DoJ\u2019s inspector general criticized the FBI for using non-violent civil disobedience as grounds to open domestic terrorism investigations.

It was also read live on air by CNN\u2019s host of Legal View, Ashleigh Banfield, and on the floor of the US Congress.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/05/stanford-sexual-assault-survivor-identifies-herself-before-release-of-memoir\">Stanford sexual assault survivor identifies herself before release of memoir</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As Bill Whitaker, the 60 Minutes journalist who interviewed Miller, described it, the statement became \u201ca manifesto\u201d for sexual assault survivors all over the world. Many will never forget the first line: \u201cYou don\u2019t know me, but you\u2019ve been inside me, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re here today.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, the impact of Miller\u2019s decision to allow BuzzFeed to publish the statement and the publication\u2019s interest in publishing it in the first place cannot be underestimated. They have helped reverse a long-term trend in media reporting of violence against women that often blames the victim, renders the perpetrator invisible, or foregrounds <em>hi</em>s feelings and the impact the crime has had on <em>his</em> life.</p> <p>Four years ago I worked for <a href=\"https://www.ourwatch.org.au/\">Our Watch</a>, Australia\u2019s national foundation to prevent violence against women, where I established the national media engagement program to address precisely those issues. As part of that project, Our Watch commissioned the first national Australian study of media representations of violence against women, including <a href=\"https://d2rn9gno7zhxqg.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/19024650/H3_2-2_Media_CONTENT_low.pdf\">a comprehensive analysis of the reporting of the 2015 Luke Lazarus rape trial</a>, an Australian case with many striking similarities to that of Miller. The results of the study were alarming.</p> <p>The research noted a \u201cdisproportionate focus on the accused compared to the complainant, including his family relations and the effect the case had on <em>him</em> and the associated muted and selective reporting of the victim impact statement\u201d. There was a strong tendency by the media as recently as four years ago to \u201cmute\u201d the victim impact statement and focus on the point of view of the alleged perpetrator.</p> <p>I\u2019m sure that research would be painfully familiar to Miller, who recounted in the 60 Minutes interview how she came to learn she had been sexually assaulted.

      "bodyText": "Chanel Miller (previously known as \u201cEmily Doe\u201d), the convicted Stanford rapist Brock Turner\u2019s victim, has waived her anonymity and given her first television interview to the US program 60 Minutes. Timed to coincide with the publication of Miller\u2019s memoir, Know My Name, it is a powerful riposte to the rape culture that enabled Miller\u2019s assault \u2013 and led many to blame her, the victim. As is now seared into the memory of many, BuzzFeed took the unprecedented decision in 2016 \u2013 a full year before #MeToo prompted a tsunami of women to bear witness to their experiences of sexual abuse \u2013 to publish Miller\u2019s victim impact statement in full, which she had read in court the day Turner was sentenced. Miller\u2019s powerful account of the impact of Turner\u2019s crime went viral, garnering four million hits in just four days. It was also read live on air by CNN\u2019s host of Legal View, Ashleigh Banfield, and on the floor of the US Congress. As Bill Whitaker, the 60 Minutes journalist who interviewed Miller, described it, the statement became \u201ca manifesto\u201d for sexual assault survivors all over the world. Many will never forget the first line: \u201cYou don\u2019t know me, but you\u2019ve been inside me, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re here today.\u201d Indeed, the impact of Miller\u2019s decision to allow BuzzFeed to publish the statement and the publication\u2019s interest in publishing it in the first place cannot be underestimated. They have helped reverse a long-term trend in media reporting of violence against women that often blames the victim, renders the perpetrator invisible, or foregrounds his feelings and the impact the crime has had on his life. Four years ago I worked for Our Watch, Australia\u2019s national foundation to prevent violence against women, where I established the national media engagement program to address precisely those issues. As part of that project, Our Watch commissioned the first national Australian study of media representations of violence against women, including a comprehensive analysis of the reporting of the 2015 Luke Lazarus rape trial, an Australian case with many striking similarities to that of Miller. The results of the study were alarming. The research noted a \u201cdisproportionate focus on the accused compared to the complainant, including his family relations and the effect the case had on him and the associated muted and selective reporting of the victim impact statement\u201d. There was a strong tendency by the media as recently as four years ago to \u201cmute\u201d the victim impact statement and focus on the point of view of the alleged perpetrator. I\u2019m sure that research would be painfully familiar to Miller, who recounted in the 60 Minutes interview how she came to learn she had been sexually assaulted. Miller, who was unconscious at the time of the attack, woke up in a hospital emergency room after two Swedish graduate students scared off Turner in the midst of the attack, chased him down and held him until police could arrive. Ten days later, while Miller was at work, she came across a news story detailing Turner\u2019s arrest for sexual assault, with the media describing him as a \u201cstar swimmer\u201d with \u201cOlympic hopes\u201d, while she was the simply the \u201cintoxicated\u201d and \u201cunconscious\u201d victim. \u201cThe first thing I did after reading the article is read the comments and there were many, awful, hateful words,\u201d Miller told 60 Minutes. \u201cWhat was she doing at a frat party, this isn\u2019t really rape, why was she alone, why would you even get that drunk.\u201d Miller has written her memoir and decided to participate in media interviews revealing her identity because she is on a mission to combat the very rape myths and victim-blaming personified by those comments. \u201cRape is not a punishment for getting drunk \u2013 we have this really sick mindset in our culture that you \u2018deserve\u2019 rape if you drink to excess,\u201d she told 60 Minutes. That point, and the damaging nature of the media reporting at the time of Turner\u2019s arrest and trial, were also stressed by the prosecutor in the case, Alaleh Kianerci, who spoke to 60 Minutes. \u201cA lot of people were looking at what Brock Turner had to lose instead of what he did to Chanel,\u201d said Kianerci. Thankfully, that is slowly changing. Here in Australia, Saxon Mullins, the victim in the Lazarus case, which was the subject of the Our Watch study, also took the decision to waive her anonymity last year to speak to Louise Milligan for an ABC Four Corners special episode, I Am that Girl. Journalist and campaigner Nina Funnell launched the Let Her Speak campaign to repeal gag laws in Tasmania and the Northern Territory that prevent journalists from naming victims of sexual abuse, even with their consent. Funnell wanted to \u201chighlight why it is important survivor voices are included in public debates\u201d. As Miller, Mullins and Funnell so powerfully demonstrate, victims who speak out can fundamentally change how we understand sexual assault, the culture that enables it and, most importantly, who should be held accountable. Hint: never the victim. Just one caveat, which I was reminded of recently when Funnell posted an article on social media warning of the dangers of reducing women\u2019s stories of sexual abuse (and I intensely dislike using the word \u201cstory\u201d to describe women\u2019s experiences of abuse) to what some have called \u201cinspiration porn\u201d. It is important to remember that there is so much more to these stories than an \u201cinspiring\u201d tale of the power of the human spirit to \u201covercome\u201d. These women are not overcoming what happened to them. Their experiences have shaped them. They have deeply uncomfortable truths to share. And they are advocating, successfully, for changes to deliver justice to victims and promote much-needed conversations about consent. So yes, by all means pay tribute to their bravery. But more importantly, really listen to what they have to say \u2013 even if it is confronting. If we are only ever \u201cinspired\u201d, than we are not doing it right. Having long been \u201cmuted\u201d, blamed and dismissed, survivors of sexual assault deserve nothing less than our full attention. \u2022 Kristine Ziwica is a Melbourne-based freelance writer",

He doesn\u2019t seem to like any of these people, with the possible exception of Marie (Sadie Scott) and her creepy downstairs neighbor (Maurice Jones), and he patronizes them terribly.</p> <p>As the evening wore on and the other characters abandoned a despondent Marie, I worried that Sunday might be related to Franz Kroetz\u2019s Request Concert, a disturbing, unbearable play about the last moments before a suicide. And then, after a two-person scene illustrating the peculiar male fantasy that a man can understand and deeply know a woman he has barely met, I started to think that the Kroetz play might be preferable.</p> <p>Many of us join book groups for the same reasons that we might buy a ticket to the theater, as a prescribed way to socialize, as a prod to enculturate ourselves, as a way to experience a text both individually and collectively. (There are differences, of course, like drink prices. Advantage: Book group.) A good book discussion or a good play can promote satisfying personal reflection, as we confront how a work calls out to us and how we do or don\u2019t answer that call.</p> <p>But a solipsistic work like Sunday, with its brittle omniscience and its airy condescension, doesn\u2019t seem interested in hearing what we have to say. Like the flash-forward ending, it\u2019s all answers and no questions. At the end I watched as my hands applauded, aware that if Sunday had been a book, those same hands would have snapped it shut and pitched it against the nearest wall.</p>",

Maybe all those years spent working on Harry Potter and the Cursed Child and King Kong have severely compromised how unmagical, non-simian creatures think and speak and behave. He doesn\u2019t seem to like any of these people, with the possible exception of Marie (Sadie Scott) and her creepy downstairs neighbor (Maurice Jones), and he patronizes them terribly. As the evening wore on and the other characters abandoned a despondent Marie, I worried that Sunday might be related to Franz Kroetz\u2019s Request Concert, a disturbing, unbearable play about the last moments before a suicide. And then, after a two-person scene illustrating the peculiar male fantasy that a man can understand and deeply know a woman he has barely met, I started to think that the Kroetz play might be preferable. Many of us join book groups for the same reasons that we might buy a ticket to the theater, as a prescribed way to socialize, as a prod to enculturate ourselves, as a way to experience a text both individually and collectively. (There are differences, of course, like drink prices. Advantage: Book group.) A good book discussion or a good play can promote satisfying personal reflection, as we confront how a work calls out to us and how we do or don\u2019t answer that call. But a solipsistic work like Sunday, with its brittle omniscience and its airy condescension, doesn\u2019t seem interested in hearing what we have to say. Like the flash-forward ending, it\u2019s all answers and no questions. At the end I watched as my hands applauded, aware that if Sunday had been a book, those same hands would have snapped it shut and pitched it against the nearest wall.",

      "bodyText": "Megan Rapinoe used her platform as the newly crowned player of the year at Fifa\u2019s The Best awards to speak out against racism and homophobia, as well as the pay gap in football. At the ceremony in Italy on Monday, Rapinoe gave nods to Iran\u2019s \u201cBlue Girl\u201d Sahar Khodayari, LGBTQ players, the anti-racism campaigns of her fellow footballers Raheem Sterling and Kalidou Koulibaly, and the battle for equal pay. \u201cStories that have inspired me most; Raheem Sterling and Kalidou Koulibaly, the young Iran woman who burnt to death, the one out MLS player, the out NWSL players,\u201d she said during her acceptance speech. She also urged others to use their voices to make changes in the game. \u201cIf we really want to have meaningful change, what I think is most inspiring would be if everybody other than Sterling and Koulibaly, if they were as outraged about racism as they were, if everybody was as outraged about homophobia as the LGBTQ players, if everybody was as outraged about the lack of equal pay and investment in the women\u2019s game other than just women, that would be the most inspiring thing to me,\u201d Rapinoe said. \u201cThat\u2019s my ask of everybody. We have such incredible opportunity, being professional football players ... we have so much success \u2026 we have incredible platforms,\u201d she said. \u201cI ask everybody here to lend your platform, to lift people up, to use this beautiful game to change the world for better.\u201d The 34-year-old also said the fact that the women\u2019s awards were announced after those of the men were a sign of progress. \u201cThose are little subtle nods but those mean a lot when in past awards shows we haven\u2019t even been here or been represented,\u201d she said. \u201cAt certain times, if the men\u2019s World Cup is on, we probably shouldn\u2019t go last and that\u2019s OK. I think catering to both in a way that elevates each sport when it\u2019s at its highest is really special.\u201d Rapinoe was the top scorer at this year\u2019s Women\u2019s World Cup, as a member of the victorious US team. The team\u2019s manager, Jill Ellis, was named coach of the year. She paid tribute to the effect Rapinoe has had on football. \u201cPinoe\u2019s so charismatic,\u201d said Ellis. \u201cI love it because she does utilise her platform and provokes people to look really hard at things we can influence and change in the world that we are in. So I think [Rapinoe\u2019s speech] was great, it was terrific.\u201d Rapinoe\u2019s speech was hotly anticipated \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s always loosely planned, loosely off the cuff,\u201d she said with a grin \u2013 but she was not alone in broadening the conversation beyond football. The Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, condemned recent episodes of racism in Italian football. \u201cGianni was stealing a little bit of my thunder, all of a sudden he\u2019s a social activist,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201c[He talked] about a lot of the issues, which is amazing. I think we as a team and me personally are pushing Gianni to be more involved, and everyone in that room.\u201d Rapinoe has used her platform to challenge Donald Trump and push Fifa on investment. She said that although individual awards were satisfying, bringing change was more important. \u201cThe award is amazing, of course, but I don\u2019t do this for individual awards,\u201d she said. \u201cEven the team awards, obviously the World Cup is incredible to win, but I think when we all look back on it it will be the way we\u2019ve changed the game and moved the world forward and really been a part of changing the world with this incredible movement that\u2019s happening right now we\u2019ll all be most proud of.\u201d By the end of this year\u2019s Women\u2019s World Cup, Fifa\u2019s investment in women\u2019s football had been upped to $1bn and prize money for the tournament is to double.

He also asked U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero to dismiss the lawsuit. </p> \n   <p>Vance said Trump was asserting the \u201cremarkable proposition\u201d that a sitting president not only enjoys blanket immunity from criminal prosecution, but also isn\u2019t required to submit to any routine grand jury request for information about what he, his businesses or employees did before he took office. </p> \n   <p>\u201cThe law provides no such sweeping immunity,\u201d the court papers said. </p> \n   <p>\u201cHere, the question is not whether a state prosecutor can indict a sitting President,\u201d the papers said. \u201cInstead, the issue is whether a third party, having been duly served with a state grand jury subpoena seeking the books and records of a number of individuals and corporate entities, including those of the President, must comply with the subpoena.\u201d </p> \n   <p>Trump\u2019s lawyers have called the subpoena requests by Vance, a Democrat, a \u201cbad faith effort to harass\u201d Trump. </p> \n   <p>Trump\u2019s lawyers say records shouldn\u2019t be released until Trump leaves office. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d893e5f8f0834740f3c0f02\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-23T22:02:55.147Z\">11.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Three House chairmen <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/three-house-chairmen-threaten-to-subpoena-administration-for-ukraine-documents/2019/09/23/da049a96-de3a-11e9-8fd3-d943b4ed57e0_story.html\">have threatened</a> to subpoena the Trump administration for documents related to Donald Trump\u2019s attempts to dig up damaging information on rival Joe Biden. </p> \n  <p>Trump admitted Sunday he had spoken to the president of Ukraine in an attempt to reopen an investigation of a business with links to the former vice-president\u2019s son. </p> \n  <p>Democratic lawmakers have said this use of the presidential office to investigate a political adversary is grounds for impeachment. </p> \n  <p>A joint statement penned by Eliot L Engel, the House foreign affairs committee chairman, Adam B Schiff, the House intelligence committee chairman, and Elijah E Cummings, the House oversight committee chairman, took the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, to task for withholding documents on the matter and gave him until Thursday to respond to the inquiry.</p> \n  <p>\u201cSeeking to enlist a foreign actor to interfere with an American election undermines our sovereignty, democracy and the constitution, which the president is sworn to preserve, protect and defend,\u201d the chairmen wrote in the letter. \u201cYet the president and his personal attorney now appear to be openly engaging in precisely this type of abuse of power involving the Ukrainian government ahead of the 2020 election.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The committees asked for the documents two weeks ago.

A new poll released this weekend found <strong>Elizabeth Warren </strong>edging out Biden in the first-in-the-nation caucus state of Iowa. According to the CNN/Des Moines Register <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/21/politics/iowa-poll-2020-democrats/index.html\">poll</a>, the Massachusetts senator is attracting the support of 22 percent of Iowa Democrats, compared to the former vice president\u2019s 20 percent. </p> \n  <p>But what\u2019s arguably even more surprising about the results is how much every other candidate, including <strong>Bernie Sanders, </strong>has fallen behind the two front-runners.

      "bodyText": "That is it from me for the night. Here are the top stories to note from this afternoon: Ilhan Omar said she does not back Joe Biden for 2020 elections. Three House chairmen are threatening to subpoena Trump on the Ukraine controversy. Manhattan\u2019s district attorney urged a judge on Monday to reject Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to block prosecutors from obtaining his tax returns. Trump tells reporters he would win the Nobel Peace prize \u2018if they gave it out fairly\u2019 Trump administration asks city officials in Iowa to remove LGBTQ-inclusive art from public spaces. Happy Monday and good night! Officials in Ames, Iowa say the Department of Transportation\u2019s Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has requested the city remove inclusive multi-colored crosswalk art in a letter sent this month. Ames, a college town with a population of around 67,000 people, installed painted sidewalks earlier this month. The new art includes gender non-binary pride colors, rainbow colors for LGBTQ rights, and colors representing support of transgender equality. It is reportedly unusual for a federal agency to make such a call and Ames officials believe the FHWA does not have jurisdiction over the roads in question. \u201cThe FHWA did not have a direct answer to this question, and it appears they are still researching whether they have any regulatory authority in this situation,\u201d officials in Ames said, according to local news station KCCI. \u201cThese streets are not part of a federal highway and these streets receive no federal funding. With the system of federalism in the United States, the federal government does not have jurisdiction over everything.\u201d Former Vice President Joe Biden implied he will not attempt to convince Iowans to vote for him in the state\u2019s 2020 Caucus. Biden is currently in second place, according to the latest polls of Iowa voters, at 20%. Elizabeth Warren is leading the polls in Iowa, with 22% of voters saying she is most likely to receive their vote. In an erratic exchange with reporters from Pakistan on Monday, Donald Trump said he would be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize \u201cif they gave it out fairly.\u201d He spoke with the press outside the United Nations General Assembly ahead of a meeting with Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan. Members of the Pakistani press praised him , saying he would \u201cdefinitely\u201d be deserving of the Nobel Peace Prize if he could solve tensions in the Kashmir region. \u201cI think I\u2019m gonna get a Nobel Prize for a lot of things, if they gave it out fairly, which they don\u2019t,\u201d Trump said. He went on to complain about former president Barack Obama receiving the prize in 200. The committee awarded Obama the prize for his \u201cefforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples.\u201d \u201cThey gave one to Obama immediately upon his ascent to the presidency, and he had no idea why he got it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd you know what? That was the only thing I agreed with him on.\u201d Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe reportedly nominated President Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize at the request of the U.S. government in February 2019. Manhattan\u2019s district attorney urged a judge on Monday to reject Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to block prosecutors from obtaining his tax returns, saying the president wants \u201csweeping immunity.\u201d From the Associated Press: District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. filed papers in federal court after Trump\u2019s attorneys sued last week to stop Vance from forcing the president\u2019s accounting firm to release eight years of his state and federal returns in a criminal probe. Vance urged a judge to reject Trump\u2019s request for a temporary order blocking Vance\u2019s subpoena for the records in a probe of payments made to two women who claimed to have had affairs with Trump. He also asked U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero to dismiss the lawsuit. Vance said Trump was asserting the \u201cremarkable proposition\u201d that a sitting president not only enjoys blanket immunity from criminal prosecution, but also isn\u2019t required to submit to any routine grand jury request for information about what he, his businesses or employees did before he took office. \u201cThe law provides no such sweeping immunity,\u201d the court papers said. \u201cHere, the question is not whether a state prosecutor can indict a sitting President,\u201d the papers said. \u201cInstead, the issue is whether a third party, having been duly served with a state grand jury subpoena seeking the books and records of a number of individuals and corporate entities, including those of the President, must comply with the subpoena.\u201d Trump\u2019s lawyers have called the subpoena requests by Vance, a Democrat, a \u201cbad faith effort to harass\u201d Trump. Trump\u2019s lawyers say records shouldn\u2019t be released until Trump leaves office. Three House chairmen have threatened to subpoena the Trump administration for documents related to Donald Trump\u2019s attempts to dig up damaging information on rival Joe Biden. Trump admitted Sunday he had spoken to the president of Ukraine in an attempt to reopen an investigation of a business with links to the former vice-president\u2019s son. Democratic lawmakers have said this use of the presidential office to investigate a political adversary is grounds for impeachment. A joint statement penned by Eliot L Engel, the House foreign affairs committee chairman, Adam B Schiff, the House intelligence committee chairman, and Elijah E Cummings, the House oversight committee chairman, took the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, to task for withholding documents on the matter and gave him until Thursday to respond to the inquiry. \u201cSeeking to enlist a foreign actor to interfere with an American election undermines our sovereignty, democracy and the constitution, which the president is sworn to preserve, protect and defend,\u201d the chairmen wrote in the letter. \u201cYet the president and his personal attorney now appear to be openly engaging in precisely this type of abuse of power involving the Ukrainian government ahead of the 2020 election.\u201d The committees asked for the documents two weeks ago. Since then, it has emerged that Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire is holding back a whistleblower complaint from Congress. The AP and other news outlets have reported the complaint is linked to a phone call where Trump pressured Ukraine\u2019s leader to investigate Joe Biden\u2019s son. Ilhan Omar said in an interview at the Iowa People\u2019s Presidential Forum that Joe Biden is not the right candidate for \u201cprogress we all want to see\u201d. \u201cI think it\u2019s been very clear to many of the people creating the kind of movement that is exciting generations that we want somebody who really has a plan that is going to tackle a lot of the systematic challenges that we have,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd he doesn\u2019t.\u201d Omar, a House representative from Minnesota, has made waves as a member of a progressive group of new Congress members alongside representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts. She did not indicate if she backed any of the other candidates running for office in 2020. Hello readers, this is Kari Paul in San Francisco taking over the blog for the next few hours. More news to come. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Kari Paul, will be taking over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Trump pushed back against reports that he allegedly pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden, arguing that \u201ccrooked\u201d journalists should be more concerned about the former vice-president\u2019s actions. (But there has been no evidence to substantiate Trump\u2019s corruption claims against Biden.) Meanwhile, one of Trump\u2019s advisers reportedly acknowledged that the Ukraine controversy could become a \u201cserious problem\u201d. Mitch McConnell accused Democratic lawmakers of trying to \u201cpoliticize\u201d the whistleblower complaint about Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president after Chuck Schumer demanded oversight hearings on the matter. The Democratic National Committee announced its heightened requirements to qualify for the fifth presidential debate. Candidates must attract at least 165,000 unique donors and receive at least 3% of support in four polls (or 5% of support in two early-state polls). Young climate activist Greta Thunberg addressed the UN general assembly and denounced leaders\u2019 inaction on combating climate change. \u201cYou have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words,\u201d Thunberg said. Kari will have more on the news of the day, so stay tuned. Another Democratic presidential candidate, Amy Klobuchar, is tweeting about the DNC\u2019s heightened requirements to qualify for the fifth debate, urging her supporters to donate. But according to an MSNBC reporter, the Minnesota senator has already crossed the fundraising threshold of attracting at least 165,000 unique donors. Climate protests halt traffic in Washington There were more than two dozen arrests in the nation\u2019s capital over this morning\u2019s \u201cShut Down DC\u201d climate crisis protests. Strategically staged as a direct action, demonstrators blocked major commuter arteries in Washington, DC. At least 26 people had been arrested before 9.30AM, according to the capital\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department. The protests were organized under the umbrella of at least 20 organizations, including 350.org, Black Lives Matter, Extinction Rebellion and Friends of the Earth, with the hashtag #ShutDownDC, demanding \u201csweeping action\u201d on the climate crisis. Crowds blocked traffic, causing gridlock, as they demanded action from world leaders. They were part of the global climate strike led by youth activists that brought many millions of people out to protest last Friday in the largest climate protest in history. Monday\u2019s protest was followed by an angry and emotional speech at the UN climate summit in New York by youth activist Greta Thunberg. Boris Johnson, the British prime minister facing severe political troubles back home, expressed confidence that Trump would be able to strike a new deal with Iran after throwing out the 2015 nuclear agreement. \u201cLet\u2019s do a better deal,\u201d Johnson told NBC News. \u201cI think there\u2019s one guy who can do a better deal ... and that is the president of the United States. I hope there will be a Trump deal.\u201d Johnson added that Britain was \u201cvirtually certain\u201d Iran was behind the attack earlier this month on a Saudi oil facility and that he considered Trump to be a \u201cvery, very brilliant negotiator\u201d. Trump resurfaced his \u201cFredo\u201d insult against Chris Cuomo when discussing the CNN host\u2019s recent interview with the president\u2019s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. \u201cI watched Rudy take apart Fredo,\u201d Trump said of the interview. \u201cRudy Giuliani took Fredo to the cleaners. First time I\u2019ve watched CNN in a long time.\u201d Giuliani\u2019s interview with Cuomo went viral after the president\u2019s lawyer contradicted himself about whether he had asked Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and accused the CNN host of being \u201cthe enemy\u201d. The campaign manager for Tom Steyer announced that the billionaire activist has similarly already met the donor threshold for the fifth Democratic debate, which was announced this afternoon. The campaign manager for Cory Booker, who qualified for the third and fourth debates but issued a fundraising plea to supporters this weekend, acknowledged that the New Jersey senator has not yet met either threshold. In a Senate floor speech, Mitch McConnell accused senior Democratic lawmakers, including Chuck Schumer, of trying to \u201cpoliticize\u201d allegations that Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate one of his political opponents. Schumer wrote a letter to McConnell earlier today urging the Senate majority leader to hold hearings on whether Trump withheld aid from Ukraine to incentivize launching a probe into Biden. Schumer wrote: \u201cThe Republican-led Senate has remained silent and submissive, shying away from this institution\u2019s constitutional obligation to conduct oversight.\u201d While speaking to (and disparaging) reporters at the UN General Assembly, Trump also denied that he pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden. But he very questionably argued that such a move, pressuring a foreign leader to investigate a political opponent, would be acceptable. \u201cI think it might probably, possibly have been okay if I did, but I didn\u2019t,\u201d Trump said, much to the likely chagrin of every ethics expert in the country. The campaign manager for Cory Booker, who issued a fundraising plea to his supporters over the weekend, acknowledged that the New Jersey senator has not met either of the qualification thresholds for the November debate. The Democratic National Committee has just announced that each debate participant must attract at least 165,000 unique donors and at least 3 percent in four polls (or at least 5 percent in two early-state polls). But one of Booker\u2019s competitors, tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang, voiced confidence that he would qualify for the November debate. An adviser to Trump acknowledged to CNN that his call with the Ukrainian president about Joe Biden could become a major issue for the administration. \u201cThis is a serious problem for us,\u201d the adviser said. \u201cHe admitted doing it.\u201d CNN has more: A separate source close to the White House said Trump\u2019s team is treating the Ukraine story like the President\u2019s taxes: That is, a problem but one that can potentially be fought out in the media and in the courts, if needed. The source familiar with the matter said some on Trump\u2019s internal White House legal team are currently leaning against releasing the transcript from the call. But a White House official brushed off concerns about Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukraine\u2019s president, calling it \u2018Mueller 2.\u2019 \u2018We\u2019ve seen this movie before,\u2019 the official said. Trump repeated his debunked corruption claims against Joe Biden and accused the media of being \u201ccrooked as hell\u201d for not reporting the false accusations as fact. \u201cJoe Biden and his son are corrupt ... but the fake news doesn\u2019t want to report it because they\u2019re Democrats,\u201d Trump said at the UN General Assembly. The president added, \u201cIf a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said, they\u2019d be getting the electric chair probably right now.\u201d Again, there has been no evidence of Biden trying to profit off his office while serving as vice president. Trump went on to slam the media. \u201cYou people ought to be ashamed of yourselves,\u201d he told the assembled journalists. While noting that he appreciated the work of some reporters, he argued that most were \u201ccrooked as hell.\u201d The Democratic National Committee has once again ratcheted up the qualifications for the next Democratic debate, which will take in November. The DNC announced in a statement that presidential candidates would have two means of meeting the polling qualification and would also have to attract 165,000 unique donors to make the debate stage. On the polling front, candidates would either have to receive at least 3 percent of support in four polls or at least 5 percent in two single-state polls from the early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina or Nevada. The raised qualifications threaten to once again decrease the number of debate-eligible candidates. After the DNC hiked the minimum figures for the third and fourth debates, the number of participants was essentially cut in half. This could spell trouble for lower-polling candidates like Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar and Juli\u00e1n Castro who managed to qualify for the last debates -- let alone candidates like Steve Bullock and John Delaney who failed to make the cut last time. Trump\u2019s dubious claims about Joe Biden trying to profit off his vice presidency are now being supported by the Republican National Committee in an email to supporters. But Trump\u2019s claims are completely baseless, as the Washington Post reports: Trump has claimed that Biden in 2016 pressured the Ukrainian government to fire Viktor Shokin, the top Ukrainian prosecutor, because he was investigating a Ukrainian gas producer, Burisma Holdings, that had added Biden\u2019s son Hunter to its board. But it turns out that the investigation had already been shelved when Biden acted and may have even involved a side company, not Burisma. The Ukrainian prosecutor was regarded as a failure, and \u2018Joe Biden\u2019s efforts to oust Shokin were universally praised,\u2019 said Anders Aslund, a Swedish economist heavily involved in Eastern European market reforms. Moreover, Yuri Lutsenko, a former Ukrainian prosecutor general who succeeded the fired prosecutor, told Bloomberg News that there was no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden. Another Democratic presidential candidate, Pete Buttigieg, appeared more cautious when asked about lawmakers gaining access to a transcript of the phone call between Trump and the Ukrainian president. He noted the concerns about potentially classified information but emphasized that Democrats should investigate the matter. Buttigieg has returned to Iowa to campaign in the first-in-the-nation caucus state as a new poll shows him nearly even with Bernie Sanders in his support. While speaking to reporters at the UN General Assembly, Trump once again proved that flattery will get you everywhere with the US president. American reporters complained on Twitter that Trump stopped taking questions from them during his meeting with Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Imran Khan, after a Pakistani reporter lavished praise on the president. Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris had harsh words for Trump amid his Ukraine controversy, saying the incident demonstrates why the president should be impeached. Trump has already repeatedly faced questions at the UN General Assembly today about what he and Volodymyr Zelenskiy discussed regarding Joe Biden in their July phone call. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Trump has confirmed he discussed Joe Biden with the Ukrainian president as calls for his impeachment escalate among House Democrats. The president will likely face more questions on the controversy today as he attends the UN General Assembly. The young climate activist Greta Thunberg addressed the UN, denouncing leaders for their inaction on combating climate change. A new Iowa poll shows Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren are neck-and-neck in the first-in-the-nation caucus state, as Bernie Sanders has slipped into a decided third place. The blog is still covering the latest updates on the Ukraine controversy and the campaign trail, so stay tuned. Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker has raised more than 500,000 since his campaign sent out a desperate weekend email asking supporters to offer financial support to his bid. \u201cHere\u2019s the bottom line: Cory 2020 needs to raise an additional $1.7 million by September 30 to be in a position to build the organization necessary to continue competing for the nomination,\u201d his campaign manger, Addisu Demissie, wrote in an email to supporters on Saturday. \u201cWithout a fundraising surge to close out this quarter, we do not see a legitimate long-term path forward.\u201d The campaign announced this morning that it is almost a third of the way toward its goal, having raised $508,629 since it sent out the request. \u201cWe\u2019re lifted by the influx of support for Cory\u2019s campaign for president -- even from individuals who haven\u2019t made up their minds who to support in this race but who believe Cory\u2019s voice is vital,\u201d Demissie said in a statement. \u201cWe still have a long way to go over the next 8 days to reach our $1.7 million goal -- but the past two days have shown the power of people rallying together to take on tough challenges. It\u2019s the same spirit that will beat Donald Trump and change this country.\u201d The young climate activist Greta Thunberg denounced inaction on combating climate change in her address to the UN General Assembly, saying the gathered leaders had \u201cstolen my dreams.\u201d Reuters has more: Thunberg, visibly emotional, said in shaky but stern remarks at the opening of the summit that the generations that have polluted the most have burdened her and her generation with the extreme impacts of climate change. \u2018This is all wrong. I shouldn\u2019t be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean yet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you,\u2019 she said. \u2018You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words,\u2019 Thunberg said. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who convened the [UN Climate Action Summit], had warned governments ahead of the event that they would have to offer action plans to qualify to speak at the summit, which is aimed at boosting the 2015 Paris Agreement to combat global warming. Trump is currently speaking at a UN General Assembly session on protecting religious freedom. But a PBS NewsHour reporter noted that the president sidestepped some of his own past comments on the topic. Trump has taken his attention away from the UN General Assembly long enough to fire off this two-part tweet questioning the allegiance of the whistleblower who raised concerns about the president\u2019s phone call with the leader of Ukraine. There is no evidence of the whistleblower having ties to another country, as the president seems to be suggesting here. And it\u2019s also worth noting that Trump has now confirmed he discussed Joe Biden during his phone call with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, so it\u2019s unclear what the president is denying he did here. Trump made an unscheduled appearance at the UN General Assembly\u2019s climate session, per a Wall Street Journal reporter. Trump had been criticized for scheduling an appearance at a religious freedom event at the same time as the climate session, but he told reporters yesterday that he was sincerely concerned about climate change. \u201cThe floods are very important to me, and uh, climate change \u2013 everything is very important,\u201d Trump said. The president was criticized last month for skipping a climate session at the G-7 summit in France, as his administration simultaneously rolls back a number of environmental regulations. It appears Trump\u2019s comments on impeachment upon arrival to the UN General Assembly were overheard by another one of the gathering\u2019s most famous guests \u2013 the young climate activist Greta Thunberg. The White House is reportedly giving serious consideration to releasing the transcript of Trump\u2019s phone call with the Ukrainian president, despite concerns about the precedent it could set. CNN reports: However, some senior administration officials, like Secretary of State Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, are against the idea because of the precedent releasing it could set with future foreign leaders \u2014 and because putting it out could give Congress ammunition to demand transcripts of Trump\u2019s calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin. White House officials were soliciting opinions from outside advisers over the weekend about whether they should release the transcript of Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president, as well as how advisers think the White House should message it if the transcript was \u2018embarrassing.\u2019 A person familiar with the discussions said the White House Counsel\u2019s Office is currently involved in evaluating whether the transcript should be released and in what form. The person saying the release could happen \u2018soon.\u2019 A Politico reporter noted that Trump\u2019s comments on his phone call with the Ukrainian president may indicate that the possibility of withholding military aid from the country was under consideration: Trump answered a question on what he told the Ukrainian president about Joe Biden by saying, \u201cYou are going to see.\u201d The answer may indicate the White House is leaning toward releasing a transcript of the phone call between the president and Volodymyr Zelenskiy, as Trump himself suggested yesterday. But Democratic lawmakers are unlikely to relent in their demands for details on the call until they receive the whistleblower complaint that kicked off this controversy. Arriving at the UN General Assembly in New York, Trump said he was talking Democrats\u2019 talk of impeachment \u201cnot at all seriously.\u201d The president also dubiously argued that his conversation with the Ukrainian leader was appropriate given the importance of discussing corruption. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to talk about corruption,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt? ... It\u2019s very important that on occasion you speak to somebody about corruption.\u201d But it\u2019s one thing to bring up a country\u2019s history with corruption and quite another to suggest that the country investigate one of your political rivals. The Senate\u2019s top Democrat is now pushing the chamber\u2019s majority leader, Mitch McConnell, to request access to the whistleblower complaint about Trump allegedly pressuring the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden. But it\u2019s highly unlikely McConnell will give any credence to Chuck Schumer\u2019s request. With Republicans in control of the Senate and few of its caucus members coming out to demand the information, McConnell is much more likely to try to avoid the issue in the hope that it will eventually go away. With Democrats in control of the House, though, the issue is bound to stay in the spotlight for the foreseeable future. The eye-popping statistic of the day: nearly 40 percent of House Republicans are leaving or have been pushed out of office since Trump became president. The Washington Post reports: Since Trump\u2019s inauguration, a Washington Post analysis shows, nearly 40 percent of the 241 Republicans who were in office in January 2017 are gone or leaving because of election losses, retirements including former House speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.), and some, such as [Michigan\u2019s Paul] Mitchell, who are simply quitting in disgust. ... The retirement numbers are particularly staggering. All told, 41 House Republicans have left national politics or announced they won\u2019t seek reelection in the nearly three years since Trump took office. That dwarfs the 25 Democrats who retired in the first four years of former president Barack Obama\u2019s tenure \u2014 and Republicans privately predict this is only the beginning. Most of the departing Republicans publicly cite family as the reason for leaving. But behind the scenes, Republicans say the trend highlights a greater pessimism about the direction of the party under Trump \u2014 and their ability to win back the House next year. Pivoting back to the Democratic campaign trail: presidential candidate Pete Buttigeig announced his second television ad buy in Iowa, the nation\u2019s first caucus state. The ad, entitled \u201cHad To,\u201d focuses on Buttigieg\u2019s biography as an Afghanistan War veteran and Indiana mayor. \u201cServing in Afghanistan, we had to be united in our mission,\u201d Buttigieg says in the ad. \u201cAfter corporate greed ripped apart the rust belt, my city had to find a way forward. Whenever I visit, I hear Iowans\u2019 frustration with politics so broken for so long.\u201d The latest CNN/Des Moines Register poll from Iowa shows Buttigieg holding steady in the state, attracting the support of 9 percent of Democratic voters. The number puts him ahead of Kamala Harris and just behind Bernie Sanders, who received 11 percent. Rudy Giuliani, who serves as a lawyer to Trump, was asked on Fox News about whether the president threatened to cut off aid to the Ukraine if the country did not investigate Joe Biden. The former New York mayor initially denied the reports as a \u201cfalse story.\u201d But when pressed on whether it was \u201c100 percent\u201d false, Giuliani said, \u201cI can\u2019t tell you if it\u2019s 100 percent.\u201d According to reports, Trump repeatedly pressured the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to work with Giuliani on a probe into Biden. Giuliani has previously suggested that Biden leaned on Ukraine to stomp out corruption because of an investigation into a natural gas company with connections to his son, Hunter Biden. But there is no evidence of wrongdoing on the younger Biden\u2019s part. That has not stopped Giuliani from cranking out baseless conspiracy theories apparently meant to try to deflect attention away from Trump. Even some Republican lawmakers are acknowledging that Trump should release the details of his phone call with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. \u201cI\u2019m hoping the president can share, in an appropriate way, information to deal with the drama around the phone call,\u201d said Republican senator Lindsey Graham, a close congressional ally of the president\u2019s. \u201cI think it would be good for the country if we could deal with it.\u201d Senator Mitt Romney, the Republican senator of Utah, said it was \u201ccritical for the facts to come out.\u201d He added, \u201cIf the president asked or pressured Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme.\u201d Of course, this is a far cry from comments from many Democratic lawmakers, some of whom have warned that Trump\u2019s reported phone call could pose a constitutional threat. Bill Weld, the former Massachusetts governor who has launched a long-shot bid against Trump for the Republican presidential nomination, said the president\u2019s phone call with the Ukrainian leader pressing him to investigate Joe Biden constitutes \u201ctreason.\u201d \u201cTalk about pressuring a foreign country to interfere with and control a U.S. election,\u201d Weld told MSNBC. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be clearer, and that\u2019s not just undermining democratic institutions. That is treason. It\u2019s treason, pure and simple, and the penalty for treason under the U.S. code is death. That\u2019s the only penalty.\u201d Weld added that, if Trump has committed treason, then the president has well crossed the threshold to be removed from office. Some of the most senior House Democrats are ratcheting up their comments on impeaching Trump, even as they avoid calling for immediately launching proceedings. Nancy Pelosi, who has stridently avoided calling for impeachment, wrote in a letter that continued White House obstruction over releasing the whistleblower complaint about Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president would trigger severe consequences. \u201cIf the Administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the President, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation,\u201d the House speaker wrote. And the House intelligence committee chairman, Adam Schiff, said yesterday that impeachment \u201cmay be the only remedy\u201d if Trump refuses to release the complaint alleging that he discussed one of his political rivals, Joe Biden, with the Ukrainian president. \u201cIf the president is essentially withholding military aid at the same time that he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader into doing something illicit that is providing dirt on his opponent during a presidential campaign, then that may be the only remedy that is coequal to the evil that conduct represents,\u201d the California Democrat told CNN. The real test will come Thursday, when acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire testifies publicly before the House Intelligence Committee. Good morning, live blog readers! Most eyes will be turned to Washington this week as talks intensify over whether House Democrats will move forward with impeachment now that Donald Trump has acknowledged he discussed one of his political rivals, Joe Biden, in a phone call with Ukraine\u2019s new president. But developments are continuing far away from Washington as well, specifically in the early voting states of the Democratic presidential primary. A new poll released this weekend found Elizabeth Warren edging out Biden in the first-in-the-nation caucus state of Iowa. According to the CNN/Des Moines Register poll, the Massachusetts senator is attracting the support of 22 percent of Iowa Democrats, compared to the former vice president\u2019s 20 percent. But what\u2019s arguably even more surprising about the results is how much every other candidate, including Bernie Sanders, has fallen behind the two front-runners. Most political commentators initially viewed the Democratic primary as a four-person race between Biden, Sanders, Warren and Kamala Harris. When Harris\u2019 polling started to dip this summer, it looked like a three-person race. Could it now become a one-on-one face-off? It\u2019s just one poll, and time will tell with more than four months left before the Iowa caucus, but Biden and Warren are currently the candidates to beat. Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping its eye on: Trump is in New York for the UN General Assembly, where he will meet with a number of world leaders \u2013 including his \u201cfavorite dictator,\u201d Egypt\u2019s Abdel Fatah al-Sisi. Joe Biden and Jill Biden will attend the funeral service for Emily Clyburn, the wife of Democratic representative Jim Clyburn who died last week, in South Carolina. Here in DC, climate activists are attempting to shut down some of the city\u2019s major intersections to demand action on climate change. The blog is watching all of that, so stay tuned.",
